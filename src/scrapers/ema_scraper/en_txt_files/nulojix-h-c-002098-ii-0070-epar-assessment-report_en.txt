Renal transplantation, the most effective treatment for end-stage renal disease, requires lifelong 
immunosuppressive therapy to prevent immune-mediated allograft injury. However, the current 
standard of care immunosuppressive therapies, the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), ciclosporin (CsA) and 
tacrolimus (TAC), are known to be nephrotoxic, and may also contribute to the development or 
exacerbation of cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
diabetes mellitus. Attempts to replace CNIs with non-CNI regimens in maintenance renal transplant 
patients have been associated with mixed results. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
immunosuppressive agents that can provide control of the alloimmune response comparable to CNIs 
without the renal and cardiovascular toxicities that may contribute to long-term graft loss and death. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Belatacept represents a class of selective co-stimulatory immunomodulators for prophylaxis of organ 
rejection in adult patients receiving renal transplants. Belatacept is a second-generation fusion protein 
consisting of the modified extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 
protein-4) fused to a fragment (hinge-CH2-CH3) of the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1); its mechanism of action involves blockade of the interaction between T-cell CD28 and the 
Assessment report

Page 7/8 
 
 
 
B7.1, B7.2 (CD80, CD86) receptors on the surface of antigen presenting cells, a key step resulting in 
the generation of co-stimulatory signals required for naïve T-cell activation. 
Belatacept was first approved in the European Union (EU) in 2011 for prophylaxis of graft rejection in 
adults receiving a renal transplant, i.e., treatment with belatacept should be initiated in immediate 
association to renal transplantation. However, according to the MAH, it is currently estimated that 
approximately 80% belatacept in clinical practice is used in conversion from a CNI-based therapy to 
belatacept, months to years after the transplantation. The purpose of this submission is to provide 
efficacy and safety data from two clinical studies of conversion of maintenance renal transplant 
patients from CNI- to belatacept-based immunosuppression: a pivotal phase 3b study (IM103116) and 
a supportive phase 2 study (IM103010). The MAH proposes a modification to the current indication 
statement in section 4.1 of the SmPC to cover the conversion use and make a clear distinction for the 
recommendation to administer an interleukin-2 (IL)-2 receptor antagonist during induction therapy 
specific to de novo transplantation.  
Approved indication at time of submission of the extension indication:  
NULOJIX, in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for 
prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults receiving a renal transplant (see section 5.1 for data on renal 
function). It is recommended to add an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist for induction therapy to 
this belatacept-based regimen. 
Proposed indication by the MAH at time of submission of the extension indication (amendment in 
strikethrough/bold): 
Nulojix, in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for prophylaxis 
of graft rejection in adults receiving recipients of a renal transplant (see section 5.1 for data on 
renal function). It is recommended to add an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist for 
induction therapy to this belatacept-based regimen. For induction therapy in de novo renal 
transplant recipients, the addition of an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist to this 
Nulojix based regimen is recommended. 
A separate posology recommendation for conversion use has also been proposed in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC: 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by the same dose every 4 weeks 
thereafter. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
No dedicated ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment was performed for this medicinal product, 
which is in accordance with the applicable guidance. The active substance is a protein, the use of which 
is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Therefore, belatacept is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Bioanalytical methods 
Quantitation of belatacept in human serum 
Two enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods were used that had previously been 
validated for belatacept by PPD., Richmond, VA (see table below). Both ELISA methods measure 
belatacept in human serum using capture antibody (coating onto a plate) and a biotin-labelled 
detection antibody. The 2 methods are identical with the exception that the ranges in undiluted human 
serum are from 3.00-72.4 ng/mL and 3.00-80.0 ng/mL, respectively (Table 2, Table 3).

concentrations 
Table 3 Belatacept method performance summary 
Detection of anti-belatacept antibodies (ADA) and neutralising antibodies (NAb) in human serum 
A qualitative, bridging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay using the Meso-Scale Discovery 
(MSD) platform (Method TLIAM-0018.29), was validated by Covance Laboratory (Previously called 
Tandem Labs), West Trenton, NJ. Due to the closure of Covance Laboratory, the ADA assay was

transferred to, and validated at Syngene International, Bangalore, India. An affinity-purified 
cynomolgus monkey anti-belatacept antibody (pAb) served as a positive control. The method is 
performed in three tiers (screening, confirmatory, and titer) using pre-established cut-points. Method 
parameters evaluated in the different laboratories are described in Table 4. 
Table 4 Immunogenicity method parameters 
Serum samples from study IM103116 that were confirmed positive for ADA to the modified CTLA-4 
portion of the molecule in the bridging ECL immunoassay, were further analysed for NAb using a 
validated, functional, in vitro cell-based bioassay at Wuxi AppTec, Shanghai, China (Method 
16BASM180V3). Drug levels ≥ 1 µg/mL in undiluted pooled human serum were found to significantly 
interfere with belatacept response in the bioassay; therefore, only those clinical samples containing 
belatacept at a concentration less than 1 µg/mL were eligible for NAb testing. 
The bioassay evaluates neutralising antibody activity by comparing the response of the post-dose 
seropositive serum sample to its corresponding Day 1 (baseline/pre-study) sample. 
The assay can tolerate up to 300 ng/mL of drug, in the presence of 2.5 μg/mL of NAb. A murine anti-
human CTLA4 mAb, 7F8, served as the positive control. A summary of the cell-based bioassay is 
provided in Table 5.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Belatacept is intended for IV administration hence bioavailability is by definition 100 %. 
Study IM103010 
Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) samples (i.e. serum trough concentrations) were collected from all 
belatacept-treated subjects pre-dose at several time points (Table 6). In addition, samples were 
collected 30 minutes after the end of infusion (EOI, 1 hour after start of infusion) at Week 20, and at 
the time of a suspected acute rejection (AR) episode (Table 7). 
Table 6 Summary statistics of belatacept trough concentrations (µg/mL) prior to infusion 
Table 7 Summary statistics of belatacept concentration (µg/mL) at 30 minutes after the end of infusion 
on Day 141 
The geometric mean trough serum concentrations of belatacept were 10.47 μg/mL on Study Day 29 
and ranged from 3.36 to 4.65 μg/mL from Study Day 169 to Day 925. According to the Applicant, 
target belatacept trough concentrations were largely achieved (10-12 μg/mL in the first 8 weeks and 2 
μg/mL thereafter). The higher trough concentration of belatacept on Study Day 29 in comparison to 
that on Study Days 169 through 925 was consistent with the greater frequency of belatacept dosing 
(every 2 weeks) in the first 8 weeks versus once every 4 weeks thereafter.

Study IM103116 
In the study IM103116, mean serum trough belatacept concentrations were 14.5, 5.2, 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 
and 5.7 µg/mL at Study Weeks 4, 20, 24, 52, 76, and 104 respectively. The higher trough 
concentration of belatacept observed at Study Week 4, in comparison to those at Study Weeks 20, 24, 
52, 76, and 104 was consistent with the more frequent belatacept dosing (every 2 weeks) that 
occurred during the first 8 weeks, versus once every 4 weeks thereafter. Following the change from 
every 2- to every 4-week dosing, the mean, geometric mean, and median belatacept serum trough 
concentrations appeared to be at steady-state and remained consistent over the 24-month study 
period.

Distribution 
No new distribution data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. Section 5.2 of the SmPC is considered up to date.  
Elimination 
No new elimination data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. Section 5.2 of the SmPC is considered up to date. 
2.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamics (PD) data have been submitted in this application, which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Quantitation of belatacept in human serum was done via two ELISA methods that had previously been 
validated for belatacept. The detection of ADA in human serum was performed with a bridging ECL 
immunoassay. Serum samples from study IM103116 and IM103010 that were confirmed positive for 
ADA to the modified CTLA-4 portion of the molecule in the bridging ECL immunoassay, were further 
analysed for NAb using a validated, functional, in vitro cell-based bioassay. The bioanalytical methods 
used were considered acceptable by CHMP. 
No formal PK studies were conducted in support of this application. PK data were collected from the 
two clinical efficacy and safety studies (IM103010 and IM103116). However, they only provided sparse 
PK data (i.e. trough belatacept concentrations) which were collected at specified time-points. 
Presented PK data can be regarded as the descriptive data which are implying desired systemic 
exposure of belatacept. The higher trough concentrations were observed at the study Week 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
compared to trough concentrations measured at later time-points. This was consistent with the greater 
frequency of belatacept dosing (i.e. 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in the first 8 weeks versus once every 4 
weeks in the maintenance phase (i.e. 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks).  
No PD data have been submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Sparse PK data from two clinical studies where belatacept was administered every 2 weeks and once 
every 4 weeks thereafter were provided in order to evaluate the desired systemic exposure of 
belatacept. Overall, the observed belatacept trough concentrations in the presented two clinical studies 
are in line with the previously reported trough concentrations, and no updates in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC are needed. No additional PK data were deemed necessary by the CHMP since the proposed 
dosing in the maintenance phase is the same as the approved one in the maintenance phase in the 
current SmPC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and safety of belatacept in the conversion setting was evaluated in two studies, the pivotal 
phase-3 study IM103116 and the supporting phase-2 study IM103010. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study  
Conversion from a CNI-based regimen at least 6 months post-transplantation was evaluated in the 
pivotal study IM103116 and the supportive study IM103010 discussed in the next sections. No dose-
response study was submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study IM103116 - Evaluation of the benefits and risks in maintenance renal 
transplant recipients following conversion to Nulojix (belatacept)-based 
immunosuppression 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study. Approximately 440 subjects 
on CNI-based regimens were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either convert to treatment with 
belatacept 5 mg/kg IV on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and every 28 days, or to continue treatment with 
their established CNI Figure 1. Subjects randomised to belatacept were to discontinue CNIs on Day 29.  
The duration of study participation was 24 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for 
safety post last dose.

Treatments 
Belatacept 
The conversion regimen used in study IM103116 is based on that used in study IM103010. 
Dosing was based upon historic experience in conversion studies. It has been shown that a 
replacement cornerstone immunosuppressive agent can be started at the customary maintenance 
dosage regimen, but that there may be an increased incidence of AR in the first few months following 
conversion. The target concentrations of belatacept in study IM103116 were identified based upon PK 
modelling conducted during the maintenance phase of the BENEFIT (IM103008) and BENEFIT-EXT 
trials (IM103027) (both studies supporting the initial marketing application), which studied the effects 
of belatacept when initiated at the time of transplant. 
In order to manage the risk of AR around the time of conversion from CNI to belatacept, subjects 
randomised to belatacept underwent tapered discontinuation of their CNI over 2 weeks beginning at 
the time of the second belatacept dose, Study Week 2 and were to discontinue CNIs on Day 29. 
Subjects were to receive an infusion of belatacept, 5 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and every 
28 days thereafter. 
Home infusion services (from Protocol amendment 05) were to be available for belatacept subjects 
beginning at Week 16 (excluding visits for months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24) at selected sites where this 
was feasible. Any such home infusions were to occur within the protocol-defined window for the 
specified visit. 
Active control 
CsA doses were to be adjusted to maintain trough whole blood concentrations in the range of 50 - 250 
ng/mL as determined by local laboratory assessment and methodology. 
TAC doses were to be adjusted to maintain trough whole blood concentrations in the range of 4 - 11 
ng/mL as determined by the local laboratory assessment and methodology. 
Background Immunosuppressive Medications 
Subjects were to be maintained on a stable daily dose of corticosteroids for the duration of the study 
unless a change in the medical condition of the subject warranted adjustment. Withdrawal of 
corticosteroids during the study was not permitted.

All subjects in this study were to be treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), Enteric-coated 
Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS) in addition to belatacept or CNI. 
Anti-viral/Fungal Prophylaxis 
It was recommended that subjects who received T-cell depleting agents at any time during the trial 
receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, cytomegalovirus and other herpes 
viruses, and Candida infections, for at least 6-12 weeks, as based upon KDIGO guidelines and/or in 
accordance with the local standard of care. 
Objectives 
The primary objective for this study was to evaluate patient and functional graft survival in 
maintenance renal transplant recipients (6 - 60 months post-transplantation) converted from CNI to 
belatacept-based immunosuppression as compared to subjects continuing CNI-based 
immunosuppression at 24 months post-randomisation.

Sample size 
Formal statistical testing of a research hypothesis was not performed in this study. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate patient and graft survival in maintenance renal 
transplant recipients converted from CNI to belatacept as compared to continuation of CNI-based 
immunosuppression at 24 months post-randomisation. A sample size of approximately 220 subjects 
per treatment group was considered to provide sufficient power to rule out an unacceptable difference 
in patient and graft survival. 
With a confidence level (one-sided) of 0.975 and assuming true rates of patient and graft survival by 
Month 24 in both treatment groups was 93%, the sample size of 220 subjects per arm afforded 90% 
probability to rule out a difference of 8.3% (sample size based on 1000 simulations per Newcombe 
methodology). 
This sample size provided 93% power to detect a 10% absolute difference of mean percentage in cGFR 
at Month 24 between the belatacept regimen and the CNI regimen assuming a standard deviation of 
30% (alpha 0.05, 2-sided). 
Given a sample size of approximately 220 subjects per treatment group, if the true AR rates by Month 
24 are 7% in the belatacept regimen and 1% in the CNI regimen, the half width of the 95% confidence

Page 18/19 
 
 
 
interval of the difference in AR rate was estimated to be 3.6% (alpha 0.05, 2-sided). With the assumed 
rates of AR, the confidence interval for the difference would be (2.4%, 9.6%). 
Given a sample size of 220 subjects per treatment group, and assuming an event rate of PTLD of 
0.74% the probability of observing at least 1 event was 80.5%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 fashion to receive belatacept or continue to receive their previous 
CNI (CsA or TAC). Subjects were stratified by screening cGFR in a 1:2 ratio (≥ 30 to < 45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 or ≥ 45 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Randomisation numbers were assigned in the order in which subjects qualified for treatment, not in 
the order of study enrolment. A randomisation schedule was generated and kept by the MAH. 
At the time of enrolment, immediately after written informed consent was obtained and before 
performing any study-related procedures, each subject was assigned a unique sequential 5-digit 
subject number by the interactive voice response system (IVRS) for identification throughout the 
study. This subject number was not reused for any other participant throughout the study. The 
physician/coordinator contacted IVRS to enrol each subject into a centralised database at the time of 
signing consent. SAE reporting for all subjects began at the time of enrolment, immediately after 
written informed consent was obtained. 
The subjects were to be randomised once all entry criteria (inclusion and exclusion) had been met.  
The physician/coordinator were to contact IVRS to randomise each subject into a centralised database. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
General. No formal statistical testing of a research hypothesis was performed in this study. All analyses 
of efficacy and safety endpoints were summarised descriptively by treatment groups (belatacept vs 
CNI). All efficacy analyses were based on all randomised subjects (ITT analysis population), unless 
stated otherwise. 
Primary endpoint. The effect of treatments on the primary endpoint “Proportion of subjects who 
survive with a functioning graft at 12 and 24 months post-randomisation” was analysed using a point 
estimate and 95% CI for the difference between belatacept and CNI (and point estimates of the 
proportion and 95% CI within each treatment group) using the “Newcombe” method (with normal 
approximation if >= 5 events in each arm with strata, else exact method without strata, see above). 
The analysis was performed in the ITT and PP analysis sets. 
Secondary endpoints. The effect of treatments on key secondary endpoints “Proportion of subjects who 
experience clinically suspected, biopsy proven acute rejection by 12 and 24 months post-
randomisation (overall vs classification of renal allograft pathology by the Banff criteria (2007)1)” and 
“Mean change and mean percent change from baseline to Month 12 and 24 in cGFR” was analysed 
using point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the between-group difference and for within-
group change. cGFR was calculated using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]

equation as published by Davidson et al. 20032. For the continuous endpoint “cGFR” a linear mixed 
effects model was applied. In addition, other secondary and exploratory endpoints were studied, which 
are not reported here (see above). 
Analysis Sets.  
The “Intent-to-Treat” (ITT) population included all subjects who are randomised into the study. 
Subjects were grouped according to the treatment to which they were randomised. 
The “Per-Protocol” population included all randomised subjects who did not violate terms of the 
protocol that might have affected the efficacy outcome. “Per-protocol” analyses were performed at 
Month 24 on the primary endpoint and “key” secondary endpoints only if the following occurred: More 
than 10% of the total number of subjects included into the “ITT” population at Month 24 have 
significant protocol violations/ deviations and consequently would be excluded from the “per-protocol” 
population. 
The Safety population included all randomised and treated subjects (received at least one dose of 
study medication). Subjects were grouped according to the treatment received. 
The PK population included subjects who received at least one dose of belatacept and have at least 1 
PK sample post baseline. 
Missing data.  
Subject and graft survival status. Any subject (either randomised to belatacept or CNI) with unknown 
subject and graft survival status at Month 12 (Month 24) (last follow-up date was prior to Day 392 
(Day 756), was considered as having an event of graft loss or death if at least one of the following 
criteria were met during 12 months (24 months) post-randomisation: 1) Subject has AR prior to last 
follow-up date; 2) Subject has PTLD prior to last follow-up date; 3) Subject’s discontinuation reason 
for study medication is due to Lack of Efficacy; 4) Subject has polyomavirus associated nephropathy 
adverse event (AE) before discontinuation; 5) Subject’s last cGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m2. For the 
remaining subjects with unknown status, they were considered as having no event of graft loss or 
death. 
cGFR. Imputation to zero for death and graft loss were performed for values for adjusted mean cGFR 
at Month 24 as sensitivity analysis. 
Interim analysis. Selected analyses were performed at month 12. The purpose of the interim analysis 
was to obtain study data to assess the evolving benefit-risk profile of belatacept conversion at 12 
months post-randomisation. Similar methods as those used for the 24-month analyses were performed 
for the 12-month interim analysis. The interim analysis was descriptive in nature, and no statistical 
tests were performed. The confidence level for the confidence interval of the estimate of the primary 
endpoint was adjusted for multiple testing using an O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function. 
Subgroups analyses. Descriptive summary statistics without testing were performed for primary and 
key secondary endpoints in the following subgroups: 1) Type of Transplant, 2) Recipient gender, 3) 
Recipient race, 4) Geographic region, 5) Recipient age, 6) Donor age, 7) End stage renal disease 
(ESRD) (Diabetes), 8) Initial CNI treatment, 9) Baseline GFR (ml/min/1.73m2), 10) Time from 
Transplantation to Randomisation, 11) Baseline Treatment Regimen. 
Sensitivity analyses. The primary analysis was performed in the ITT and PP analysis sets.

A sensitivity analysis was performed, using the imputation methods for unknown subject and graft 
survival status (see above). An additional analysis was performed using no imputation, either for 
subjects lost to follow-up or for subjects with unknown subject and graft survival status. For subjects 
with unknown status, the number of subjects with AR, PTLD, AE of polyomavirus associated 
nephropathy, and last cGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m2 was summarised. 
Study conduct. The date of finalisation of the final statistical analysis plan (version 3.0) was not 
documented. The clinical database was locked on 2019-09-10.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 631 subjects were enrolled and 446 subjects were randomised (223 in each treatment 
group; 1 subject was randomised to the belatacept group but only received treatment with CNI). 
The reasons for not being randomised are summarised in Table 9 and the study subject distribution is 
given in Table 10.

Recruitment 
Subjects were recruited at 85 sites in 10 countries (Argentina, Austria, Colombia, France, Germany, 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United States of America). 
Conduct of the study 
Relevant protocol deviations were defined as related to inclusion or exclusion criteria, study conduct, 
study management, or subject assessment that were programmable and could potentially affect the 
interpretability of study results. Relevant protocol deviations are pre-specified in the SAP.  
A review identified two subjects with relevant protocol deviations; one in each treatment arm  
(Table 12).

Significant protocol deviations were defined as study conduct that differed significantly from the 
protocol, including GCP noncompliance. Approximately 200 significant protocol deviations were 
reported. Most significant protocol deviations concern failure to report AEs in a timely manner, failure 
to obtain written consent in a correct manner and deviation from inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the 
latter group, incorrect tapering of CNI, incorrect corticosteroid administration and failure to ensure 
stable renal function/immunosuppression were common issues.  
The original protocol for this study was dated 22-May-2012. Study Initiation Date: 17-Apr-2013. 
The changes in the protocol as of 10-Sep-2019 (clinical cut-off date), are summarised in Table 13.

Table 13 Summary of Changes to Protocol (IM103116) 
Five global protocol amendments were executed during the study; four of them (Amendments 03, 05, 
07 and 08) after the initiation of the study (17-Apr-2013) (see details in Table 13). In an open label, 
protocol amendments after study initiation date may raise concerns regarding study integrity and 
potentially data-driven decisions. Considering that no formal hypothesis testing was performed, no 
increase of the risk of false positive conclusions (type 1 error) is expected, however, bias of estimates 
of efficacy or safety of treatments may still be introduced. Here, considering only global amendments 
as relevant, only modification of study objectives and revision of eligibility criteria may raise concerns. 
In response to request for supplementary information, the MAH discussed in more details the 
amendments, underlying motivations and potential biases in the data.

•  Amendment 01 was implemented prior to the opening of enrolment in April 2013 and so 
applied to all study participants.  
•  Amendment 02 was specific for the study sites in Germany and concerns the requirement for 
chest radiographies and the diagnosis of tuberculosis.  
•  Amendment 03 affected eligibility criteria but had minimal effect on enrolment. This is 
accepted. 
•  Amendment 04 was a country specific amendment implemented for Argentina and Colombia 
and concerned Post-Study Access to Therapy.  
•  Amendment 05 concerned enrolment and was motivated by the low recruitment and high 
screen failure rate. 89% of the enrolled patients were enrolled under Amendment 5.  
In summary, no substantial impact of different clinical study protocols on patient characteristics and 
results was observed.

the as-treated (safety) population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of subjects alive with a functional graft at Month 24 was similar in the belatacept and 
CNI treatment groups (Table 19). A total of 8 subjects died (4 in the belatacept group and 4 in the CNI 
group), all with functioning grafts. Two graft losses (0.9%) were reported in the CNI arm versus none 
in the belatacept arm.

Results for the imputation sensitivity analysis for subjects with unknown subject and graft survival 
status at Month 24 were consistent with the ITT analysis.

Table 20 Summary of biopsy proven acute cellular rejection (Banff Grade 1A or higher), 24-month 
study period - all randomised subjects (IM103116) 
When analysed selectively for Banff Grade 1A or higher acute cellular rejection while excluding any 
borderline cellular or antibody mediated acute rejection events, the proportion of subjects with BPAR at 
Month 24 was higher in the belatacept group compared to the CNI group (18/223 [8.1%] vs 6/223 
[2.7%] respectively, at Month 24). The Cox model hazard ratio estimate (95% CI) was 3.14 (1.25, 
7.91). Of note, no additional events of BPAR occurred after Month 12 in the belatacept arm, whereas 
three of the six events in the CNI arm occurred between Month 12 and 24. 
When BPAR was analysed to include antibody-mediated rejection beside Banff grade IA or higher 
cellular rejection, the proportion of subjects with BPAR or humoral (antibody-mediated) rejection was 
unchanged in the belatacept group (8.1%) but increased to 4.0% in the CNI continuation group. This 
was attributable to three additional subjects, each of whom developed isolated, antibody mediated 
acute rejection. The Cox model hazard ratio estimate (95% CI) was 2.09 (0.94, 4.65). 
Between Months 12 and 24, two CNI continuation subjects were reported to have experienced 
functional graft loss, one of which events occurred following BPAR. Functional graft loss was reported 
for two additional CNI continuation subjects several days to several weeks beyond the Week 104 study 
visit; for one of them, the graft loss followed BPAR. To Month 24, no belatacept conversion subject 
experienced functional graft loss, with or without a preceding episode of BPAR. 
In the sensitivity analyses, the proportion of subjects with BPAR, including borderline or higher cellular 
and antibody mediated acute rejection was higher in the belatacept group (9.9%) compared to the CNI 
group (5.8%). The proportion of subjects with clinically suspected acute rejection at Month 24,

independent of biopsy confirmation, was higher in the belatacept group (13.0%) compared to the CNI 
group (10.3%).  
Symbols represent censored observations. Days are not the scheduled visits but the actual number of days from randomisation

subject occurring during the 24 Month ITT analysis period (see definition in the SAP). Biopsy proven AR were either clinically 
suspected by protocol defined reasons or clinically suspected by other reasons and treated. Only the acute cellular rejection episode 
with the highest Banff severity grade for each subject is counted.

When analysed with imputation to zero for death and graft loss, values for adjusted mean cGFR at 
Month 24 were 55.5 and 48.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, for the belatacept and CNI groups, respectively.

Number of subjects refers to the number of randomised subjects within each category for categorical parameters. 
Percentages are based on this number of subjects. For continuous parameters, the number of subjects refers to the number of 
randomised subjects with non-missing values at both the Month and baseline. 
Adjusted estimates based on repeated measures model with treatment, month (categorical), baseline cGFR (continuous) and 
interaction of treatment by month as covariates. The model includes data from all post-baseline Months during the 24 Month ITT 
analysis period. Calculated GFR (cGFR) (mL/min/1.73 m^2) based on the 4-variable MDRD formula. cGFR values after graft loss or 
resumption of maintenance dialysis are not included in the analysis.

Exploratory endpoint: Impact of AR on Renal Function, Infection and Malignancy, and Patient and Graft 
Survival 
For the subjects who experienced at least one episode of BPAR and for whom a Month 24 result was 
available, the mean cGFR (change from baseline) were 49.7 (-0.1) mL/min/1.73m2 in the belatacept 
group and 28.7 (-23.2) mL/min/1.73m2 in the CNI group. 
Of the 27 subjects who experienced at least one episode of BPAR, 2/18 (11.1%) in the belatacept 
group and 4/9 (44.4%) in the CNI group experienced serious infections. Out of the 416 subjects 
without BPAR, 35/203 (17.2%) in the belatacept group and 40/213 (18.8%) in the CNI group 
experienced serious infections. Of the subjects who experienced at least one episode of BPAR, no 
subjects in the belatacept group and 1/9 (11.1%) in the CNI group experienced a serious viral 
infection. No central nervous system (CNS) infections or tuberculosis infections were reported up to 
Month 24. 
Of the 27 subjects who experienced at least one episode of BPAR, one malignancy was reported 
following an isolated episode of BPAR diagnosed 67 days after the initial belatacept infusion. 
Of the 27 subjects with BPAR up to Month 24, 1/18 (5.6%) belatacept-treated subjects, and no CNI-
treated subjects, died with a functioning graft by Month 24. Of the subjects with BPAR, 1/9 (11.1%) in 
the CNI group, and none in the belatacept group, experienced subsequent death censored graft loss.

Exploratory endpoints: Mean Change in Fasting Lipid Profiles and New-onset Diabetes after 
Transplantation 
Mean changes from baseline fasting serum lipid concentrations are summarised in Table 22. 
Table 22 Mean Changes in Lipids at Month 24 - All Randomised Subjects (IM103116) 
Mean fasting HDL-cholesterol showed a slight numerical increase in the belatacept group, while total- 
and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased. The improvements in total- and LDL-cholesterol and 
triglycerides were numerically larger in the CNI arm.  
The proportion of subjects who developed new onset diabetes after transplantation was similar in the 
belatacept (5.4%) and CNI (4.0%) treatment groups. The adjusted difference from CNI (95% CI) was 
0.6 (-2.6, 3.8). One additional subject in the CNI continuation group who met the prospectively 
defined protocol criteria for NODM was excluded from the analysis due to an error that was not 
identified until after the final database lock. 
Exploratory endpoint: Patient-Reported Outcomes Research 
The relative impact of belatacept conversion, as compared with CNI continuation on patient-reported 
symptom occurrence and symptom distress, as related to side effects of their immunosuppressive 
medication regimens, was evaluated using the updated Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and 
Distress Scale (MTSOSD-59R) up to Month 12 (Table 19). Higher scores in the MTSOSD-59R indicate a 
greater symptom and symptom distress burden than lower scores.

2.4.3.  Supportive study 
Study IM103010: Belatacept Conversion Trial in Renal Transplantation 
Methods 
Study design 
Study IM103010 was a phase 2, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study. The 
duration of the study was 12 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for safety 
evaluations. All subjects who completed the 12-month phase of the initial study, and met inclusion 
criteria and provided consent to continue, were eligible to participate in a long-term extension (LTE) 
Subjects on CNI-based regimens (approximately equal numbers of subjects on TAC-based and on CsA-
based regimens) were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either 1) discontinue CNI treatment and begin 
belatacept treatment (5 mg/kg intravenous [IV]), or 2) continue treatment with an established CNI 
regimen.  
All subjects received background maintenance immunosuppressive regimen of MMF, MPA, sirolimus 
(SRL), or azathioprine (AZA), with or without adjunctive corticosteroids, according to their 
immunosuppressive regimen at the time of enrolment. 
Key differences in study design between IM103010 and IM103116 are presented in Table 27.

Study Participants  
The study population included male and female (≥18 years of age) recipients of a renal allograft from a 
living donor or a deceased donor at least 6 months, but not longer than 36 months, prior to 
randomisation. 
Subjects at low to moderate immunological risk were eligible. The study excluded subjects of greatest 
immunological risk as identified by prior graft loss due to AR, recent (< 3 months) AR, or Banff 97 
Grade IIA or greater AR since transplantation of current allograft. For key differences between studies 
IM103010 and IM103116 concerning patient population and concomitant immunosuppression, please 
refer to Table 27 above.  
Treatments 
Apart from the possibility of home treatment added to study IM103116 in protocol amendment 05, 
belatacept dosing and CNI tapering in the belatacept arm were identical in both studies. Therefore, for 
details on belatacept dosing and CNI tapering, please see study IM103116 above. 
Subjects treated with CNI who had completed 12 months of treatment and entered the LTE were 
allowed to switch from their CNI to belatacept after on or about 01-Jan-2010. Written confirmation 
from the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) was required before a subject could convert from CNI to 
belatacept.  
In October 2011, the CNI arm was discontinued after completing the Year-3 follow-up. If CNI subjects 
did not convert to belatacept, the subjects were removed from study participation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective in study IM103010 was to assess the effects of a belatacept-based 
immunosuppressive regimen relative to a CNI regimen on the change in cGFR from baseline to 12 
months post-randomisation. 
The primary objective of the LTE was long-term safety and tolerability of belatacept in subjects who 
completed 12 months of treatment in the main study and entered the LTE.

Tertiary endpoints:  
•  Measures of hypertension 
•  Measures of dyslipidaemia 
•  Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio 
The following efficacy measures were summarised for the Intent-to-treat long-term extension (ITT-LT) 
population: 
•  Calculated GFR and Serum Creatinine 
•  Acute Rejection  
•  Subject Survival and Graft Survival  
•  Dyslipidaemia-related Endpoints  
•  New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) 
Sample size 
The primary objective was to estimate the effect of conversion from a CNI-based to a belatacept-based 
maintenance immunosuppression regimen on change in cGFR from baseline to 12 months post-
randomisation. The sample size was determined in order to provide a reasonable precision of the effect 
to be estimated. The estimate of the treatment effect was given by the mean difference of change 
from baseline to 12 months post-randomisation between belatacept and CNI group. With 85 subjects 
per treatment group the half-width of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean 
changes in cGFR between the belatacept group and the CNI group was estimated to be 5.71 
mL/min/1.73 m2, assuming a standard deviation of 19 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 fashion, stratified by site and initial CNI medication, to receive 
belatacept or to continue receiving their previous CNIs (CsA or TAC).  
Each subject who qualified for treatment was assigned a unique randomisation number by IVRS. A 
randomisation schedule was generated and kept by the MAH. Randomisation numbers were assigned 
in the order in which subjects qualified for treatment, not in the order of study enrolment.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Study IM103010 also included an LTE study to assess the ongoing safety and tolerability of belatacept 
in subjects who have completed 12 months of treatment in the main study IM103010. Since its 
objective is not related to the evaluation of efficacy, methods of the long-term extension study will not 
be discussed in this section. 
General. The study evaluates the hypothesis that the belatacept-based regimen will result in 
preservation of renal function in the belatacept treatment group (relative to a CNI-based treatment 
group).

Primary endpoint analysis. The effect of belatacept vs CNI treatment on the primary endpoint “Change 
in calculated GFR from baseline to 12 months post randomisation” was evaluated by the estimation of 
the difference and 95% confidence intervals between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance 
model (ANCOVA). The analysis was supported by estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the 
primary endpoint within each treatment group. cGFR was calculated using the 4-variable Modification 
of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation as published by Davidson et al. (2003, PMID 12775942). 
The “change in calculated GFR from baseline to Month 12” was analysed with an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with factor for randomisation group (treatment), baseline calculated GFR and pre-
randomisation CNI regimen (CsA or Tac) to assess the difference between the belatacept treatment 
group and the CNI group. If other factors are deemed to be clinically relevant, then they were used as 
covariates in additional ANCOVA analysis. The 95% CI for the estimated treatment difference from the 
ANCOVA model was reported. The primary analysis was performed using analysis set “All randomised 
with observation” (M1, see below). In all ANCOVA analyses, subjects with a missing baseline calculated 
GFR assessment were excluded. 
Secondary endpoint analyses. The effect of belatacept vs CNI treatment on major secondary endpoints 
“Incidence of acute rejection at 6 months” and “Subject and graft survival at 6 months” was evaluated 
with similar methods, which are here only described for the former endpoint. 
The effect of belatacept vs CNI treatment on the proportion of subjects who have at least 1 acute 
rejection up to Month 6 post-randomisation was evaluated by the estimation of the difference and 95% 
confidence intervals between treatment groups. The analysis was supported by estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals of the endpoint within each treatment group. Similar methods were used to 
analyse the incidence and severity of acute rejection by Month 12. The analysis was based on the 
analysis set “All randomised with observation” (M1, see below). 
Confidence intervals (CIs) for analysis of proportions were computed using normal approximation, if 
the number of the events in that treatment arm was at least 5. Otherwise, confidence interval using an 
exact method were provided. Any between-treatment CI for the proportion analyses were computed 
using normal approximation, if the number of the events in each individual treatment arm was at least 
5. Otherwise, confidence interval using an exact method were provided. 
In addition, other secondary and exploratory endpoints were studied, which are not reported here (see 
above). Depending on the clinical relevance of any observed differences in baseline characteristics 
between treatment groups adjustments were made to the statistical models.  
Analysis Sets. 
Primary Efficacy Data Set (M1, ITT). All randomised subjects are included in this dataset following the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) principle based on observed values. In addition, an imputation of the primary 
endpoint is performed as described below (“M2” data set). 
Secondary Efficacy Data Set (M3, PP). All randomised subjects, who did not violate terms of the 
protocol that might have affected the efficacy outcome following the per-protocol principle. “Per-
protocol” analyses were performed on the primary endpoint of “change in calculated GFR from baseline 
to 12 months post-randomisation” and the secondary endpoints of “death/graft loss” and “acute 
rejection by 12 months”, only if the following occurred: 1) More than 10% of the total number of 
subjects included into the “ITT” data set at Month 12 had relevant protocol deviations and 
consequently would be excluded from the “per-protocol” data set. 2) The “As-Treated” population 
included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of CsA or belatacept. 
Analyses for all other efficacy endpoints were performed using the primary efficacy analysis set (“ITT”) 
only. All safety analyses were performed on the data set that included all randomised and treated

subjects. All available data from belatacept-treated subjects were included in analyses of PK and 
immunogenicity. 
Missing Data.  
Calculated GFR. For subjects who missed measurement due to death/graft loss, the calculated GFR 
value of 10 and 0 (sic) will be both imputed and carried forward up to month 12. Missing values of 
post-baseline calculated GFR due to reasons other than death/graft loss will be imputed using linear 
regression method as long as at least 2 post baseline time points with 4 months apart have calculated 
GFR values. The presence of missing data and its imputation using a combination of multiple 
approaches for the primary endpoint “cGFR” may have created bias in the estimation of treatment 
effect. In response to request for supplementary information, the MAH clarified the applied imputation 
method and performed the primary analysis based on 1) multiple imputation using relevant covariates 
(assuming missing-at-random data) and 2) a jump-to-reference imputation (using a conservative 
missing-not-random-data) for the primary endpoint. 
Acute Rejection. An acute rejection-free subject who is not followed-up through the entire event-
counting period due to any reason will be considered as having no acute rejection during that period. 
Interim analyses. No interim analysis was performed. 
Subgroup Analyses. Analyses of the primary endpoint “Calculated GFR” were performed for subgroups 
at various timepoints. Subgroup analyses of secondary endpoints of “subjects and graft survival” as 
well as “acute rejection by month 12” were performed only if 5% or more of the total number of 
subjects in each randomisation group had events that occurred during the event counting period. 
Summary statistics for efficacy measures by treatment arm were presented for only those subgroup 
categories that consisted of 10% or more of the total study population. No statistical tests were 
performed for subgroups. 
Subgroups analysis were based on the following factors: 1) type of transplant, 2) recipient gender, 3) 
recipient race, 4) geographic region, 5) recipient age, 6) women recipient age, 7) ESRD, 8) initial CNI 
treatment, 9) baseline GFR, 10) time from transplantation to randomisation, 11) time to complete 
withdrawal of CNI in subjects randomised to belatacept, 12) pre-randomisation/baseline diabetes 
status. 
Subgroup analyses of AEs were only done for subgroup factors of type of transplant, recipient gender, 
recipient race, geographic region, recipient age, women recipient age, initial CNI treatment. 
Sensitivity Analyses.  
ANCOVA analyses on the primary endpoint “Change in calculated GFR from baseline to month 12” 
using methods of M1, M2 and LOCF were performed. In the LOCF-based ANCOVA analysis, the last 
available post-baseline calculated GFR value prior to Month 12 was used as the imputed calculated GFR 
value at Month 12. 
To assess the trend in renal function, piecewise regression was used to analyse the changes in 
calculated GFR from baseline to various time points post-randomisation for belatacept vs. CNI with 
terms for treatment, time points and baseline calculated GFR. The population mean slope and 
associated 95% CI was estimated for each treatment group. The analyses were performed in the 
analysis sets “All randomised with observation (M1)” and “All randomised with imputation (M2)” 
analysis sets.

Regarding the secondary endpoint “Acute Rejection”, a sensitivity analysis was performed, in which an 
acute rejection-free subject who was not followed-up through the entire event-counting period was 
considered having an acute rejection if the histological evidence on any biopsy is graded as Banff 
grade IIA or higher by the local pathologist.

Conduct of the study 
The SAP (V1.0) was finalised in 2007-06 (day missing) and amended on 2009-06-03 after the 1-year 
and 1.8-year renal transplant data from the two ongoing pivotal studies (IM103008 and IM103027) 
became available. The date of the “month 36” (LTE) database lock was 2011-08-11.

Table 30 Baseline Demographics of Transplant Recipients - All Randomized Subjects (ITT) (IM103010) 
The differences in baseline data between the treatment arms are not expected to affect the outcome of 
Study IM103010. Baseline cGFR, which is of utmost interest for the primary endpoint, was well 
balanced with cGFR 53.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the belatacept arm and 54.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the CNI 
arm. 
Compared to study IM103116, the mean age in Study 103010 was approximately eight years lower 
(45 years versus 53 years). The number of white subjects and subjects from Europe was markedly 
lower in IM103010 than in Study IM103116 (56% versus 85% and 21% versus 42%, respectively). 
Baseline cGFR was similar in the two studies, whereas the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension at 
baseline was slightly lower in Study IM103010 which may reflect the lower mean age in the study.  
The proportion of TAC subjects in the CNI arm was higher in study IM103116 compared to Study 
IM103010 (89% vs 56%). As discussed earlier, Study IM103010 was initiated six years before Study 
IM103116, and there may have been some alteration in standard immunosuppression during this time.  
As opposed to Study IM103116, the eligibility criteria in Study IM103010 did not exclude EBV 
seronegative recipients. One EBV negative recipient in each treatment arm received an organ from an 
EBV positive donor. Six subjects (7%) EBV negative recipients in the CNI arm and 3 (4%) in the 
belatacept arm received a transplant from a donor with unknown EBV serostatus. Furthermore, in 36% 
of the subjects in the belatacept arm and 32% in the CNI arm, EBV serostatus was unknown for both 
recipient and donor.  
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses for the primary analysis at 12 months were based on randomised subjects; safety 
analyses were based on randomised and treated subjects. For details, please see above.

Change from baseline in cGFR 
In the ITT-LT population analysis of cGFR (81 belatacept conversion subjects and 81 CNI continuation 
subjects) at Month 12, the mean (SD) as observed cGFRs were 60.3 (16.2) and 57.8 (13.6) 
mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The corresponding mean (SD) changes from baseline were +7.1 (12.0) 
and +2.8 (9.7) mL/in/1.73 m2, in the belatacept conversion group and CNI continuation group, 
respectively. 
Changes in cGFR with error bars representing the 10th and 90th percentiles over time up to 36 months 
are shown in Figure 5. No formal comparisons were planned between the belatacept and CNI 
treatment groups.

Acute rejections 
AR was defined as a biopsy-proven rejection that was either clinically suspected for protocol-defined 
reasons or clinically suspected for other reasons and treated. All biopsies were confirmed by a blinded 
central pathologist. 
In the first 12 months of the study for the ITT population, by Month 6 post-randomisation, 6 of 84 
subjects (7%) in the belatacept group had AR compared with none of 89 subjects in the CNI group. 
There were no additional AR episodes after Month 6 through Month 12. 
In the ITT-LT population, AR occurred in 4 subjects during the first 12 months of the study, and in 1 
subject from Month 12 to Month 36 for belatacept. For CNI, ARs occurred in 4 subjects from Month 12 
to Month 36. No recurrences of the 7 post-conversion events of BPAR (1 after Month 12) were reported 
in the belatacept conversion group. Of the subjects with BPAR, two (one in each treatment arm) had 
graft loss by Month 36. 
Death and Graft Loss 
In the ITT population during the first 12 months of the study, no graft loss was reported in either 
treatment arm. In addition, no deaths were reported in the belatacept group during the first 12 
months. One subject in the CNI conversion group died with a functioning graft within 12 months post-
randomisation; the death was attributed to myocardial infarction. Therefore, this subject’s death is not 
included in the ITT-LT population analysis.

In the ITT-LT population up to 36 months, two subjects experienced functional graft loss (one in the 
belatacept conversion group following an episode of BPAR [Day 126] and one in the CNI continuation 
group), and 1 subject died with a functioning graft in the belatacept conversion group. No subjects in 
the CNI treatment group died after Month 12. 
Metabolic endpoints 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure up to Month 12 are summarised in Table 32. Analysis of 
changes in blood pressure were not performed beyond 12 months, during the LTE.

subjects (IM103010) 
Table 33 presents a summary of mean changes in lipid parameters at Month 12 for all randomised 
subjects.

By Month 12, one subject in the belatacept arm versus two in the CNI arm were reported with new 
onset of diabetes (NODM). 
At Month 36 in the ITT-LT population, the incidence of NODM for subjects without a prior history of 
diabetes was 7% (4 subjects) in the belatacept group and 5% (3 subjects) in the CNI group. HbA1c 
values at Month 36 were similar between groups for those subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus 
at baseline. 
There were no major differences between the treatment arms regarding blood pressure, dyslipidaemia 
and NODM at Month 12.  
Donor-Specific Antibodies (DSA) 
At baseline, three subjects in each treatment reported positive DSA. At Month 12, one additional 
subject in the CNI arm had developed DSA.

Testing for DSA was not performed after Month 12. 
Patient reported outcome 
The SF-36 was used to evaluate the changes in patient quality of life (QoL). 
At Month 12, there were no statistical differences in the SF-36 subscale scores, physical component 
summary score, or mental component summary score between treatment arms. Similarly, when 
examining the change in scores from baseline to Month 12, there were no differences in the change in 
SF-36 subscale scores or the physical and mental component summary scores between treatment 
arms (p-value ranging from 0.26 to 0.83 for the eight subscales.  
At Month 36, no statistical differences were observed between the belatacept conversion and CNI 
continuation groups in terms of the SF-36 subscale scores 
The Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale (MTSOSD-59R) was used 
to assess the occurrence and distress of symptoms associated with immunosuppressive therapies. Ridit 
scores were calculated at 12 months for overall symptom occurrence score and overall symptom 
distress. The Ridit score reflects the probability that a score observed for an individual randomly 
selected from a group would be higher (worse symptom) than a score observed for a randomly 
selected individual from the reference group. No difference in Ridit scores between the 2 groups were 
observed in IM103010. 
No clinically relevant differences were reported in QoL-related measurements. As discussed for Study 
IM103116, self-reported scoring of QoL in open-labelled studies need to be interpreted with great 
caution. 
•  Safety and efficacy in subjects who were allowed to switch from CNI to belatacept 
As of 01-Jan-2010, subjects were allowed to switch from CNI to belatacept, if clinically indicated (SW 
population). A total of 16 subjects switched. The most common reason for switching was “Patient 
preference” (10/16 switches). Of these 16 subjects, one discontinued treatment because of an AE after 
140 days of exposure. Up to the Month-36 database lock, 7 subjects had been on belatacept for 253 to 
364 days and 7 had been on belatacept for 365 days or more. The remaining 2 subjects were on 
belatacept less than 168 days. 
Of the 16 subjects who switched to belatacept, one subject had AR 182 days after switching to 
belatacept without graft loss. 
On the day of switch, mean cGFR was 62.6 ± 18.43 ml/min/1.73m2 in subjects who switched from CsA 
and 64.7± 10.48 ml/min/1.73m2 in those who switched from TAC. 
At Week 4 post-switch, mean percentage change from switch to Week 4 post switch was 2.5 ± 9.93 
ml/min/1.73m2 in subjects who switched from CsA and 2.1 ± 9.50 ml/min/1.73m2. At Week 24 post 
switch, the mean percentage change from switch in subjects who switched from CsA was -7.1 ± 21.68 
ml/min/1.73m2 and +10.5± 21.04 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects who switched from TAC. cGFR values 
for the 16 subjects at Week 24 post-switch are summarised in Table 34.

2.4.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-
analysis) 
This section summarises key efficacy findings from the conversion studies IM103010 and IM103116 as 
compared to the pivotal de novo studies IM103008 and IM103027. The maintenance dosing regimen of 
5 mg/kg every 4 weeks used in both conversion studies was the same as that administered during the 
maintenance phase of both pivotal phase 3 de novo transplant studies. 
BPAR 
As observed in the belatacept treatment groups in pivotal phase 3 studies IM103008 and IM103027, in 
study IM103116, the distribution of BPAR severity, as based on the Banff classification of renal 
allograft pathology was skewed toward a greater number of moderate and severe events following 
belatacept conversion. However, the allograft histopathologic findings consistent with pure humoral 
(antibody-mediated) rejection (n = 3), and the only death-censored (pure) graft loss reported post-
BPAR (n = 1), occurred only in the CNI continuation treatment group. 
In both studies IM103010 and IM103116, the observed frequency of acute rejection in the belatacept 
arm through 36 and 24 months (8.4 % and 8.1%, respectively), was lower to a clinically meaningful 
extent than that observed in the approved (less intense) treatment regimen in de novo renal 
transplant recipients in pivotal studies IM103008 and IM103027 through 36 months (17.3% in 
IM103008 and 18.9% in IM103027). 
Based upon the above observations, in particular, those from the larger phase 3b study IM103116, the 
approach to surveillance for clinical and laboratory evidence of acute allograft rejection following 
conversion of existing renal allograft recipients to belatacept is expected to be not different from that 
employed in standard of care monitoring following use of belatacept in de novo renal transplantation. 
Renal Function 
In studies IM03010 and IM103116, despite the higher observed rate and severity of BPAR following 
belatacept conversion, renal filtration function, as determined from baseline adjusted, cGFR, was 
higher at the end of each study period than those of the groups randomised to continue CNI-based 
immunosuppression. This treatment difference was apparent in both studies, but even more so in the 
larger, more robust IM103116, in which higher mean levels of cGFR were observed beginning at 3 
months post-conversion and subsequently persisted through the end of the 24-month study period. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021

both studies, the pattern of change was subjectively similar to the trends observed in the phase 3 
pivotal studies IM103008 and IM103027. 
In study IM103116, renal function, as determined from baseline-adjusted cGFR, was lower among 
subjects who experienced BPAR in both treatment groups; however, adjusted mean cGFR was lower at 
Month 24 in CNI continuation subjects than in belatacept conversion subjects. This finding is similar to 
that observed in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials in de novo renal allograft recipients. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current standard of care immunosuppressive therapies with renal transplantation, the CNIs, CsA 
and TAC, are associated with renal and cardiovascular toxicities. Belatacept represents a class of 
selective co-stimulatory immunomodulators approved in the EU in 2011 for prophylaxis of graft 
rejection in adults receiving a renal transplant, i.e., treatment with belatacept should be initiated in 
immediate association to renal transplantation, as a substitution for a CNI in a triple 
immunosuppressive therapy. However, according to the MAH, it is currently estimated that 
approximately 80% belatacept in clinical practice is used in conversion from a CNI-based therapy to 
belatacept, months to years after the transplantation. The MAH proposes a modification to the current 
indication statement to include the conversion use. The intended new population, adult renal 
transplant recipients, is considered similar to the approved population in all other aspects except that 
they have been given CNI since the transplantation. Therefore, the present indication is to a large 
extent supported by existing data. In this light, the lack of formal statistical testing in the conversion 
studies was found acceptable to the CHMP. 
The concept “de novo”-transplant recipients is used in the dossier for subjects receiving belatacept 
according to the approved indication, i.e. in immediate association to the transplantation and not as 
“first time renal recipients”. This term is defined as “the newly transplanted patients” in the SmPC. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study IM103116 
The main study IM103116 was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study. 
Approximately 440 subjects on CNI-based regimens were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either 
convert to treatment with belatacept or to continue treatment with their established CNI. The duration 
of study participation was 24 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for safety post last 
dose.  
The open-label design, though associated with inherent weaknesses, is considered acceptable to the 
CHMP. Belatacept is administered IV every fourth week in maintenance phase as opposed to CNI-
based therapy, which is normally administered orally twice daily. Furthermore, the dosing of CNI is 
determined by trough serum concentrations, which would preclude a double-blind design.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Five global protocol amendments were executed during the study; four of them (Amendments 03, 05, 
07 and 08) after the initiation of the study (17-Apr-2013). In an open label study, protocol 
amendments after the study initiation date may raise concerns regarding study integrity and 
potentially data-driven decisions. Considering that no formal hypothesis testing was performed, no 
increase of the risk of false positive conclusions (type 1 error) is expected; however, bias of estimates 
of efficacy or safety of treatments may still be introduced. Here, considering only global amendments 
as relevant, only modification of study objectives and revision of eligibility criteria may raise concerns. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 57/58 
 
 
 
The MAH was asked to discuss the amendments and their justification in more detail. As requested, the 
MAH described and motivated the protocol amendments, which were clinically and methodologically 
justified. No substantial impact of different clinical study protocols on patient characteristics and 
results was observed. Therefore, it was agreed by the CHMP that the protocol amendments did not 
impact the data integrity. 
Several issues potentially leading an inflation of the risk of false positive conclusions based on 
statistical testing were identified, including unclear description and possible use of an inadequate 
statistical model for testing a non-inferiority hypothesis and inconsistencies between the descriptive 
objectives and the used inferential statistical methods (eg CIs). However, given the level of efficacy 
demonstrated, as well as the support from data on the use of belatacept post de novo transplantation, 
data are considered sufficiently interpretable for regulatory decision-making. The MAH was asked to 
comment on the identified problems. The MAH described the objectives and statistical methods in the 
study. Although the use of inferential statistical methods in a descriptive study is not completely 
consistent, considering the context of the application for an extension of an existing indication with 
extensive off-label use the presented descriptive results are regarded as sufficiently robust to allow an 
assessment of the benefit-risk ratio. 
No substantial missing data was found in the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint (BPAR). 
However, the presence of substantial missing data and a limited imputation model for the endpoint 
“cGFR” may have created bias in the estimation of endpoints. As discussed in the safety section, 9/18 
subjects in the belatacept arm of IM103116 experiencing a BPAR discontinued study treatment. For the 
majority of subjects remaining on treatment after a BPAR, mean cGFR values at all timepoints in both 
treatment arms was above 40 mL/min/1.73m2 in IM103116. However, as both events of BPAR and 
treatment discontinuation related to BPAR was higher in the belatacept arm, the approach not to 
impute missing values may have resulted in an overestimation of renal function in the belatacept arm 
in IM103116. Therefore, additional sensitivity analyses based on 1) multiple imputation with relevant 
covariates (assuming missing-at-random data) and 2) a jump-to-reference imputation (conservatively 
assuming a missing-not-at-random data) were performed upon CHMP request and provided by the 
MAH. The results supported the conclusions from the results previously presented in the clinical study 
report. This was found acceptable to the CHMP. 
The date of finalisation of the final SAP (version 3.0) was initially not documented. As requested by the 
CHMP, the MAH provided the relevant dates. The SAP was finished after initiation of the study, which 
may create concerns regarding study integrity. However, considering the context of the application for 
an extension of an existing indication with extensive off-label and overall robust descriptive results, 
these potential concerns were considered of minor relevance by the CHMP.  
According to the CHMP guideline on Clinical investigation of immunosuppressants for solid organ 
transplantation (CHMP/EWP/263148/06, 2008), the primary efficacy endpoint for induction, initial 
and/or maintenance prophylaxis (primary prophylaxis) should be efficacy failure rate using a 
composite endpoint consisting of patient death, graft failure, BCAR and graft function. The primary 
endpoint of study IM103116 was the proportion of subjects who survive with a functional graft at 24 
months post-randomisation, i.e. the components BCAR and graft functions were not included in the 
composite primary endpoint. BCAR and graft function are included among the pre-specified secondary 
endpoints. The primary endpoint is clinically relevant and considered acceptable to the CHMP, as 
belatacept is already approved for a similar indication. 
Study IM103010 
Study IM103010 was a phase 2, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study.  
The duration of the study was 12 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for safety 
Assessment report

evaluations. All subjects who completed the 12-month phase of the initial study, and met inclusion 
criteria and provided consent to continue, were eligible to participate in a LTE. 
The study population included male and female (≥18 years of age) recipients of a renal allograft 6- 36 
months prior to randomisation, e.g., there was a shorter time frame after transplantation for inclusion 
in IM103010 compared to IM103116. The lower limit of eligible baseline in GFR was slightly higher in 
IM103010 versus IM103116 (35 vs 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Furthermore, the eligibility criteria concerning 
concomitant immunosuppressive treatment were narrower in IM103116. As opposed to Study 
IM103116, EBV serostatus was not an eligibility criterium in Study IM103010. The amendment 
requiring EBV seropositivity reflects the wording of section 4.4 of the approved SmPC. Despite these 
differences, the two study populations are considered comparable and both representative of the renal 
transplant recipient population.  
The primary endpoint in Study IM103010 was change in cGFR from baseline to 12 months post-
randomisation. This is considered acceptable for a supportive phase 2 study. 
Month 12 data from study IM103010 were in part assessed in the original MAA for belatacept 
(EMEA/H/C/2098). The 36 Month ITT-population (ITT-LT) contains all subjects randomised in the 
beginning of IM103010 entering the LTE, i.e., data from subjects discontinuing the study up to Month 
12 and subjects not choosing to enter the LTE are not included in the analyses.  
The statistical methods in this supportive study are endorsed by the CHMP to provide descriptive 
results without claims based on statistical hypothesis testing. Multiple minor inconsistencies were 
noted regarding the definition of objectives and related statistical analyses (e.g. descriptive vs. 
inferential). CHMP considered therefore that the interpretation of study results should be only 
descriptive. The MAH was asked to describe the primary analysis and key secondary analysis more 
clearly with respect to selected analysis sets, visits, imputation methods, within- and between-
treatment comparisons, covariate selection procedure, etc which were pre-specified as relevant for 
decision-making. The MAH described the objectives and statistical methods of this supportive study. 
Although the use of inferential statistical methods in a descriptive study is not completely consistent, 
the study design and statistical methods in this supportive study are acceptable to the CHMP. 
Considering the context of the application with an intended new population similar to the approved 
population in all aspects except that these patients have received CNI since the transplantation, the 
presented descriptive results are regarded as sufficiently robust to allow an assessment of the benefit-
risk ratio.  
The presence of missing data and its imputation using a combination of multiple approaches for the 
primary endpoint “cGFR” may have created bias in the estimation of treatment effect. The statement 
on cGFR imputation included in the SAP “the calculated GFR value of 10 and 0 will be both imputed and 
carried forward up to month 12” did not describe clearly the imputed value. The MAH was thus asked 
to clarify the applied imputation method and to perform the primary analysis based on 1) multiple 
imputation using relevant covariates (assuming missing-at-random data) and 2) a jump-to-reference 
imputation (using a conservative missing-not-random-data) for the primary endpoint. As requested by 
the CHMP, the MAH clarified the raised ambiguities and provided relevant sensitivity analyses and 
corresponding results, which supported the previously reported results in the clinical study report. This 
was found acceptable to the CHMP. 
Literature search 
The MAH has provided a literature review identifying clinical abstracts and published papers up to 
October 2019 related to conversion of existing renal transplant recipients from CNI- to belatacept-
based immunosuppression. Excluding publications summarising data from study IM103010, 26 
abstracts and manuscripts reporting conversion from CNI- or mammalian target of rapamycin 
Assessment report

inhibitors (mTORi)- based immunosuppression to belatacept were identified, summarising 
approximately 967 patients. A supplemental literature search was conducted in February 2020, 
identifying four additional manuscripts.  
The duration of follow-up, time from transplantation to switch and demographic baseline data varied 
largely between the studies, which represented single- and multiple-case reports, randomised clinical 
trials, retrospective reviews, and retrospective case control single-centre and multi-centre studies of 
any size. In 21 single-and multicentre reports of 6 or more patients converted to belatacept, patient 
survival varied between 84% and 100%, all studies but two with a patient survival of >90%. Median 
follow-up time in these studies were 6-26.5 months with all studies except one having a follow-up time 
of ≥12 months. Graft survival in the same studies varied from 80% to 100%. In general, renal 
function improved, or remained stable in most patients following conversion. There was substantial 
variability in the extent to which mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) improved following 
conversion from approximately 6 to 38 mL/min/1.72 m2 in different studies by about 12 months later. 
The MAH has also summarised data from a prospective, observational cohort study from France, in 
which 228 recipients of a renal allograft from a living or deceased donor who had, in all but 2 cases, 
were started on CNI-based immunosuppression at the time of transplantation, and subsequently 
converted to belatacept based therapy. In brief summary, the mean (SD) follow-up time post-
conversion was 28 (16) months. Graft survival was 93% and mean (SD) eGFR increased from 31 (14) 
mL/min pre-conversion to 40 (16) mL/min 12 months post-conversion. 
In summary, although, detailed assessment of literature data is precluded, the literature review 
presented by the MAH could be considered to support efficacy of belatacept in the conversion setting. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Participant flow 
In study IM103116, 446 subjects were randomised to belatacept or CNI; 223 in each treatment group.  
Slightly more subjects in the belatacept arm versus the CNI arm completed the treatment period (87% 
versus 84%, respectively). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the belatacept 
arm was AEs (5.4 % vs 3.1% in the CNI arm). It was however noted that subjects in the CNI arm 
continued their usual treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the CNI 
treatment arm was at the patient’s request.  
At the end of the study, 109 subjects in the belatacept arm transitioned to commercially available 
belatacept whereas 90 subjects returned to standard of care.  
In study IM103010, 173 subjects were randomised, 84 to belatacept and 89 to CNI. The slight 
imbalance was explained by stratification. 
In both treatment arms, 98% of the subjects completed the 12-months treatment period. More 
subjects in the belatacept compared to the CNI arm completed the LTE (86% vs 70%). CNI subjects 
were considered completing treatment, not discontinued, when the CNI treatment arm was 
discontinued, if they did not switch to belatacept. Thirty-eight (38) subjects randomised to CNI 
switched to belatacept during the LTE, of whom 16 did so before closure of the CNI arm.  
Baseline data 
In both studies, baseline cGFR was balanced between the treatment arms, which is of relevance for the 
outcome of the study. There were some imbalances between the treatment arms in both studies, e.g. 
the baseline prevalence of diabetes type I was higher in the belatacept arm versus the CNI arm (6.3 vs 
1.8 %) in IM103116 and the number of white subjects and European subjects was lower in the 
belatacept compared to the CNI arm (52% versus 60% and 18% versus 25%, respectively) in 
Assessment report

IM103010. However, the CHMP did not consider that these discrepancies in baseline characteristics 
would have a major impact on study outcome. 
Study IM103010 was initiated six years before study IM103116. Changes to the clinical practice have 
been introduced in the meantime and therefore standard of care immunosuppression, organ 
preservation, and donor and recipient criteria may not be entirely identical between the studies. 
Compared to study IM103116, the mean age in study IM103010 was approximately eight years lower 
(45 years versus 53 years). The number of white subjects and subjects from Europe was markedly 
lower in IM103010 than in study IM103116 (56% versus 85% and 21% versus 42%, respectively). 
Baseline cGFR was similar in the two studies, whereas the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension at 
baseline was slightly lower in study IM103010 which may reflect the lower mean age in the study.  
The proportion of TAC subjects in the CNI arm was higher in study IM103116 compared to study 
IM103010 (89% vs 56%).  
Both study populations are considered representative of the renal transplant population. 
Survival with functional graft 
24-month survival with functional graft was the primary endpoint in study IM103116 and secondary 
endpoint in study IM103010. There were no remarkable differences in cause of death between the 
treatment arms in either study. 
In study IM103116, the 24-month survival with functional graft was similar in the belatacept 
conversion and CNI continuation treatment groups (98.2% and 97.3%, respectively). Four deaths 
(1.8%) were reported in each treatment arm, whereas two graft losses (0.9%) were reported in the 
CNI arm versus none in the belatacept arm.  
Extensive subgroup analyses showed that for all subgroups except “End stage renal disease (diabetes): 
yes”, the proportion of subjects surviving with a functional graft in the belatacept treatment arm was ≥
95%. For “End stage renal disease (diabetes): yes”, the proportion of subjects surviving with a 
functional graft in the belatacept treatment arm was 94.7% versus 96.7% in the CNI arm.  
In study IM103010, 12-month survival with functional graft was 100% in the belatacept arm versus 
98.9% in the CNI arm. No graft loss was reported in either treatment arm up to Month 12. In addition, 
no deaths were reported in the belatacept group during the first 12 months. One subject in the CNI 
conversion group died with a functioning graft within 12 months post-randomisation. 
In the ITT-LT population up to 36 months, two subjects experienced functional graft loss (one in the 
belatacept conversion group following an episode of BPAR and one in the CNI continuation group), and 
one subject died with a functioning graft in the belatacept conversion group. No subjects in the CNI 
treatment group died after Month 12. The survival with functional graft was 97.5% in the belatacept 
arm and 98.8% in the CNI arm.  
In summary, up to Month 24 in study IM103116 and to Month 36 in study IM103010, there were five 
fatal events for each treatment. Three events of graft loss were reported in the CNI arms and one in 
the belatacept arms. Survival with a functioning graft was >97% in both treatment arms in both 
studies. Thus, conversion from CNI to belatacept did not impair graft or subject survival up to 24 and 
36 months, respectively, in studies IM103010 and IM103116. In the pivotal “de novo-studies”, patient 
survival with a functioning graft was higher in the belatacept arms than the CNI arms, but overall, 
lower compared to the conversion studies. This was anticipated, as the early post-transplant period is 
considered the highest risk for rejections and/or graft loss. 
Patient and graft survival are considered robust outcome measures, not affected by the open-label 
design of the studies. The CHMP considers that the high survival rate with a functioning graft of 98% 
of the subjects in the belatacept arms is a strong support for efficacy of belatacept treatment also in 
the conversion setting.

Change in cGFR from baseline 
Mean change in cGFR from baseline to 12 months post randomisation was the primary endpoint in 
IM103010 and Mean change in cGFR from baseline to 24 months post randomisation was a secondary 
endpoint in IM103116.  
In both studies, mean baseline cGFR was well balanced between the treatment arms; 50 
mL/min/1.73m2 in the belatacept arm and 51 mL/min/1.73m2 in the CNI arm for IM103116 and 53 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the belatacept arm and 54 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the CNI arm for IM103010. 
At Month 24 in IM103116, adjusted mean cGFR in the belatacept arm had increased to 56 
mL/min/1.73m2 (+14.3%) (n=189 [85%]) in the belatacept arm compared to a decrease to 49 
mL/min/1.73m2 (-1.2%) (n=171 [77%]) in the CNI arm. Similar results were seen in all subgroups. 
At Month 12 in IM103010, mean cGFR had increased in both treatment arms; however, the increase 
was numerically larger in the belatacept arm: 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (+7.0%) (n=82 [98%]) in the 
belatacept arm versus 56 mL/min/1.73m2 (+2.1%) (n=87 [98%]) in the CNI arm.  
The baseline values for the ITT-LT population are not entirely identical to the baseline values for the 
IM103010 ITT population, as data from subjects in IM103010 not entering the LTE were not included. 
At the end of the 12-month treatment period, mean change from baseline in cGFR in the ITT-LT 
population was +7.1 and +2.8 mL/in/1.73 m2, in the belatacept conversion group and CNI 
continuation group, respectively (n=81 in both arms).  
In the initial variation submission, the MAH presented the Month 36 data in different ways (either as 
“Week 148” or “Month 36”) in different documents. Upon request, the MAH clarified that the “Month 36 
analysis in the IM103010 LTE closeout report” was based on “28-day-months”, whereas Month 36 in 
the IM103010 clinical study report (CSR) is based on the actual number of days from entering the 
study. In the CSR, Month 36 equals Week 148. This explains the apparent differences between the 
IM103010 CSR and the IM103010 LTE closeout report.  
Both ways, there was a “target day” with an analysis window, in which the measurements should be 
done. The day range for analysis in the Month 36 CSR Addendum (i.e. Week 148) corresponds to the 
protocol planned study visit schedule and therefore most subjects had available cGFR measurements in 
that analysis window. This supports the inclusion of Week 148 results, with a larger difference between 
the treatment arms data in section 5.1 of the SmPC. This is accepted by the CHMP. 
In summary, in both studies, there was an increase in cGFR compared to baseline in the belatacept 
arm. In the CNI arms, mean cGFR decreased (IM103116) or showed a small increase (IM103010). This 
is consistent with the pivotal de novo-studies, in which there was a small increase in cGFR in the 
belatacept arm versus a decrease in the CNI arm between Month 1 and Year 3 after the 
transplantation. After the first couple of months post-transplantation, the renal function of the graft is 
usually stable or slowly deteriorates. Even a small increase in cGFR is therefore considered to be of 
clinical relevance. The small increase in the CNI-arm in IM103010 is not fully understood. However, as 
discussed under methodology, the imputation method may have created bias in the estimation of 
treatment effect.  
Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) 
BPAR was a secondary endpoint in both studies. 
In IM103116, BPAR (Banff Grade 1A or higher acute cellular rejection while excluding any borderline 
cellular or antibody mediated acute rejection events) was more commonly reported in the belatacept 
versus the CNI treatment arm (18/223 [8.1%] vs 6/223 [2.7%], respectively, at Month 24). In 
addition, three events of humoral rejection were reported in the CNI arm versus none in the belatacept 
Assessment report

arm up to Month 24, giving a total number of rejections in the CNI treatment arm of 9/223 (4.0%). Of 
note, no additional events of BPAR occurred after Month 12 in the belatacept arm, whereas three of 
the six events in the CNI arm occurred between Month 12 and 24. It should be noted that whereas 
none of the subjects experiencing a BPAR in the belatacept arm lost the graft, 9/18 subjects 
discontinued study treatment in the association with the event. 
In IM103010, during the first 12 months, six subjects in the belatacept arm (7%) experienced AR 
versus none in the CNI arm. All AR were reported during the first six months and none of the events 
led to graft loss by Month 12. Two of the subjects discontinued study treatment reporting “lack of 
efficacy”, whereas the remaining four completed the 12-month treatment period and entered the LTE.  
Between Month 12 and Month 24 there were three events of AR in the CNI arm versus none in the 
belatacept arm, and between Month 24 and Month 48, one additional AR was reported in each 
treatment arm. It should however be noted that the subject reported with AR after Month 24 in the 
CNI arm had switched to belatacept on study day 988 whereas the event of rejection occurred on 
Study day 1170. It is thus questionable whether this event should be regarded as a late rejection in 
the CNI arm or rather as a rejection approximately 6 months after switch to belatacept. 
Notwithstanding, the 6/7 events of AR reported in the belatacept arm (the event discussed above not 
included) occurred during the first six months after the transition. In summary, during the first 12 
months of both studies, 24 events of BPAR were reported in the belatacept arms versus three in the 
CNI arm, resulting in a 12-month rate of BPAR of 7-8% in the belatacept arm versus 0-3% in the CNI 
arm. In the initial marketing authorisation of the “de novo”-indication, a higher number of BPAR was 
seen in the belatacept arm compared to the CNI arm in both pivotal studies. The number of BPAR was 
numerically lower in both treatment arms in the conversion studies compared to the “de novo”-studies, 
as was expected as most episodes of acute rejections are normally reported in the early post-
transplant period. Both in the “de novo”- and conversion setting, the vast majority of BPAR in the 
belatacept arm were reported up to Month (6-)12. In the conversion setting, the number of BPAR 
reported after Month 12 were comparable between the treatment arms indicating that the increased 
risk of BPAR with belatacept compared to CNI is not maintained. This is consistent with the finding that 
the development of de novo donor specific antibodies, considered a risk factor for rejection and graft 
loss, was smaller in the belatacept arm of the conversion studies (Table 25). It should also be noted 
that there was no increase of graft loss in the belatacept versus CNI arms, neither in the “de novo”- 
nor conversion studies. 
Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints 
Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints in both studies included effect on lipid profiles, new 
onset of diabetes, blood pressure and self-reported quality of life-assessments. The MAH did not 
propose to include these outcomes in the SmPC, which is agreed by the CHMP. The differences 
between the treatment arms were generally modest and no safety concern was raised by the results.  
Safety and efficacy in subjects who were allowed to switch from CNI to belatacept 
Sixteen subjects were allowed to switch from CNI treatment to belatacept during the LTE in IM103010 
after 01 Jan 2010. The switches were made between post-transplantation Day 760 and Day 1130. The 
most common reason for switching was “Patient preference” (10/16 switches). One subject 
discontinued belatacept treatment due to an AE; the other fifteen subjects remained on belatacept 
treatment. One subject experienced an acute rejection without graft loss after the switch.  
cGFR data at Week 24 was divergent, with mean percentage change from switch of -7.1 ± 21.68 
ml/min/1.73m2 in subjects who switched from CsA and +10.5± 21.04 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects who 
switched from TAC.  
It is agreed with the MAH, that the results of the analysis in the switch population should be 
interpreted with caution in view of the low number of subjects who switched to belatacept. The MAH 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 63/64 
 
 
 
was nevertheless asked to present the outcome of the major primary and secondary endpoints 
(survival with functioning graft, BPAR and change in cGFR) in both IM103010 and IM103116 for 
subjects randomised to belatacept from a TAC based and from a CsA based therapy separately. Even 
though improvement in baseline-adjusted mean cGFR was numerically greater following conversion to 
belatacept from CsA versus TAC in both studies, the outcome in both arms was consistent with the 
outcome of the study population, i.e., a larger improvement in the belatacept vs CSI arm. The 
likelihood of survival with a functioning allograft was similar regardless of initial therapy.  
The most striking finding was that all belatacept conversion subjects who experienced at least one 
event of acute cellular BPAR in study IM103116 (with or without a humoral component; n=18) were 
receiving TAC at baseline, whereas the rates of cellular or antibody-mediated acute rejection were the 
same in the CNI continuation subgroups. The same difference was not seen in IM103010.  
As pointed out by the MAH, a possible explanation to the imbalance in background treatment in 
subjects with BPAR in IM103116 may be that 89% of the subjects in in study IM103116 were treated 
with TAC before conversion. This is accepted. 
Wording of the indication and posology 
The proposed final wording of the indication is “Nulojix, in combination with corticosteroids and a 
mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult recipients of a renal 
transplant (see section 5.1 for data on renal function)”.  
In the conversion studies, the studied population was narrower than the broader indication of adult 
recipients of a renal transplant. Indeed, the eligibility criteria restrict the studied population by 
excluding subjects with cGFR <30 (<35 in IM103010) and >75 mL/min/1.73m2 and limiting inclusion 
of subjects with a history of acute rejections and high immunological risk. It is assumed that the upper 
limit of cGFR for inclusion was set to identify subjects with beginning CNI toxicity, which is considered 
a subpopulation with a need for non-CNI based immunosuppression. Likewise, it is supposed that the 
lower cGFR limitation was set to exclude subjects with extensive chronic allograft nephropathy, less 
likely to benefit from conversion to another immunosuppressive therapy. However, there are other 
clinical situations in which the use of belatacept may be advantageous, for example in subjects with 
AEs on CNI. Furthermore, in subjects with poor compliance, the use of belatacept given in a health 
care setting every four weeks may be a better option. The CHMP agrees that there is no reason to 
assume that the efficacy of belatacept in the conversion setting in subjects with better renal function 
than 75 mL/min/1.73m2 would be different from that reported in the studies. This is supported by the 
data provided in the original MAA, where no clinically relevant effects on belatacept clearance was seen 
with decreased renal function. This is reflected in the approved SmPC, including a wording in section 
4.2 that no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment or undergoing dialysis. 
The CHMP agrees therefore that the results from the studies can be extrapolated to subjects with all 
levels of renal function. The broad population in the proposed wording of section 4.1 of the SmPC is 
accepted. The eligibility criteria further restrict the study population by excluding subjects with high 
immunological risk. This is not considered to affect the wording of the indication but has been reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC which states that “There are no data on conversion in patients considered 
to be at higher immunological risk as these were excluded from the conversion studies based on 
protocol defined criteria related to their previous rejection history (see section 5.1). Such patients may 
initially be at further risk of acute rejection following conversion to belatacept than those who were 
actually studied. In subjects with high immunological risk, conversion should only be considered when 
the potential benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks.” 
Furthermore, the initial additional proposed wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC “For induction therapy 
in de novo renal transplant recipients, the addition of an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist to this 
Nulojix based regimen is recommended” is moved to section 4.2 of the SmPC as this is not an absolute 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 64/65 
 
 
 
condition for use and to make it clearer in which population the IL-2 receptor antagonist should be 
given.  
In the approved indication, belatacept is started at the day of transplantation. The risk of graft loss 
and/or acute rejections is highest in the early post-transplantation period, slowly decreasing over 6-12 
months after transplantation. To adjust immunosuppression to this increased risk, a more intense 
belatacept treatment is administered in the initial phase in the de novo setting. After 12 weeks, the 
subjects are transferred to a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks. According to the literature, 
there is a tendency to an increased risk of graft loss and/or acute rejections after conversion of 
immunosuppressive therapy. To meet this risk in the proposed conversion setting, the MAH proposed 
that belatacept should not be started at the maintenance dose in the conversion setting; instead, 
belatacept is administered more often  (5mg/kg every 2 weeks) during the first eight weeks, in parallel 
with a slow tapering of CNI. After two months, the same maintenance therapy as in the “de novo”-
setting was given. This posology was used in the conversion studies (studies IM103116 and IM103010) 
and was found effective in prophylaxis of graft rejection. The MAH proposed to amend section 4.2 of 
the SmPC with this information as a recommended posology for the conversion setting. This is agreed 
by the CHMP. Furthermore, conversion of clinically stable patients receiving a CNI-based maintenance 
regimen to a belatacept-based regimen may initially increase the risk of acute rejection. Closer 
monitoring for acute rejection is recommended for at least 6 months following conversion to 
belatacept, as per local standard of care. This is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data indicate that conversion from CNI to belatacept did not impair graft or subject 
survival up to 24 and 36 months, respectively, in studies IM103010 and IM103116. In both studies, 
there was a larger improvement in mean cGFR change compared to baseline in the belatacept arm. 
Furthermore, although a higher incidence of BPAR was shown comparing belatacept and CNI in the 
conversion studies, the data do not indicate a higher rate of BPAR in the conversion studies than in the 
pivotal de novo studies. The majority of BPAR in the belatacept arm occurred during the first year of 
treatment. 
Therefore, from an efficacy point of view, the proposed revised indication is agreed by CHMP: Nulojix 
in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for prophylaxis of graft 
rejection in adult recipients of a renal transplant (see section 5.1 for data on renal function). The 
posology for conversion use is also acceptable: 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed 
by the same dose every 4 weeks thereafter. 
Consequently, the sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the new 
indication, the posology at time of conversion, a warning about conversion from CNI-based 
maintenance regimen and the results of the two conversion studies. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Clinical investigation of belatacept has been ongoing since 19-Nov-1998. As of 14-Jun-2019, 
approximately 2,037 subjects have been exposed to belatacept through the MAH-sponsored clinical 
trials, and an estimated 6,011 subjects have been exposed to commercially available belatacept. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 65/66 
 
 
 
In the latest approved RMP (version 17.2, dated March 05, 2020), no important identified or potential 
risks are included in the Summary of safety concerns. The known safety profile of belatacept is 
consistent with that of immunosuppressive therapies. Typical AEs for this class of drugs are PTLD, 
infections and malignancies. Furthermore, injection-related reaction including anaphylaxis and graft 
thrombosis have been reported for belatacept.  
Due to differences in study design, data across studies were not pooled. All safety presentations were 
based on the population of randomised and treated subjects and were presented by treatment group. 
Patient exposure 
IM103010 
In the as-treated population through Month 12, 98% of belatacept subjects and 98% of CNI subjects 
remained on assigned treatment. The mean (median) days of exposure through Month 12 was 357 
(364) days for the belatacept group and 358 (364) days for the CNI group. 
By the 36-month database lock, 93% of belatacept subjects and 74% of CNI subjects had received 
study medication for 1093 days or more. The mean (median) exposure through the end of the study 
was 1270 (1264) for the belatacept group and 1195 (1242) days for the CNI group. 
IM103116 
The mean (median) duration of exposure to study medication up to Month 24 was comparable in both 
treatment groups: 690 (756) days for belatacept conversion and 658 (737) days for CNI continuation 
Adverse events 
IM103010 
The majority of subjects had an AE up to Month 12 (primary endpoint). A higher percentage of 
belatacept-treated subjects (94%) compared to CNI-treated subjects (83%) was reported to have 
experienced one or more AEs (Table 35).

IM103116 
In Study IM103116 up to Month 24, 96% of belatacept conversion and 92% of CNI continuation 
subjects were reported to have experienced one or more AEs (Table 36). 
Table 36: Exposure Adjusted Most Common Adverse Event (Reported in at Least 5% of Subjects in any 
Treatment Group) Summary 24 Month Study Period All Randomized and Treated Subjects 
The proportion of subjects with AEs reported to Month 24 and considered by the investigator to be 
related to study medication was 36% in the belatacept conversion group and 33% in the CNI 
continuation group. The majority of AEs reported to Month 24 were mild to moderate in intensity. 
In study IM103010, the incidence rate (IR) of infections (events/100 patient years) was higher in the 
belatacept versus CNI arm at Month 36 (72 vs 43), whereas the opposite was reported at Month 24 in 
IM103116 (64 vs 77). In both studies, the IR for malignancies were comparable between the 
treatment arms (5.3 vs 5.0 for belatacept and CNI, respectively, in IM103010 and 6.6 vs 6.3 in 
IM103116).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event (SAE) 
In IM103116, 48% of the subjects in the belatacept arm and 43% in the CNI arm reported a SAE. The 
corresponding numbers for IM103010 Month 12 was 24% and 19%, respectively and for Month 36 
46% and 44%.  
Listings of AEs reported in ≥1% of the subjects (i.e. >2 subjects) in IM103116 are presented in Table 
37.  
Table 37 Exposure Adjusted Serious Adverse Events (Preferred Terms Reported in ≥1% of Subjects) 
Summary 24 Month Study Period All Randomized and Treated Subjects (IM103116) 
The spectrum of SAEs reported in the belatacept arm of both studies is consistent with the known 
safety profile of belatacept. No new and unexpected SAEs are reported. 
Deaths 
In Study IM103010, three fatal events, one in the CNI arm (a 58-year-old male) and two in the 
belatacept arm (a male aged 27 years, and a female aged 58 years with multiple cardiovascular risk 
factors, were reported up to the Month 36 data lock point (DLP). One of the subjects was <30 years of 
age. None of the events was assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator. All three subjects 
experienced sudden death at home. The recorded cause of death was myocardial infarction in the two 
older subjects, both with risk factors for cardiovascular events. It is agreed with the Investigators that 
a causal association to the study drug is less probable in these two cases. It is however considered 
that an assessment of causality to belatacept cannot be made for the 27-year-old man due to limited 
information.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 69/70 
 
 
 
 
Two additional deaths (males, aged 51 and 32 years) occurred subsequent to the DLP in IM103010, 
after approximately 4.5 years of belatacept treatment. The cause of death were sepsis and brain 
abscess, respectively. The event of brain abscess was assessed probably related to the study 
treatment, whereas the event of cellulitis was assessed as unrelated.  
As severe infections and sepsis are common AEs with immunosuppressive therapy, both events are 
considered possibly/probably related to the study drug.  
In IM103116, three belatacept conversion subjects (males, aged 64 years, 65 years and 69 years) 
experienced unwitnessed death at home that was attributed to probable acute coronary events. Of 
them, two had a past history of coronary artery disease and the third had a history of hypertension.  
It is agreed with the Investigators that a causal association to the study drug is less probable in these 
cases.  
The four deaths in the CNI continuation group of IM103116 were attributed to gram negative sepsis 
(65-year old male), disseminated histoplasmosis (56-year old male), acute myocardial infarction with 
complications (49-year old male), and complications of a strangulated small bowel obstruction after 
surgery (47-year old female). None of the deaths were considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. 
It is agreed with the Investigators that the events of myocardial infarction and strangulated bowel 
could be considered unrelated to study drug. However, as severe infections and sepsis are common 
AEs with immunosuppressive therapy, the events of histoplasmosis and gram-negative sepsis a 
reconsidered possibly related to treatment. In this context, it should be noted that the subject 
reporting gram-negative sepsis had discontinued study treatment with CNI approximately 150 days 
before the event and was now on belatacept treatment. 
Two additional deaths occurred after study completion. A 57-year old male in the CNI arm presented 
at the Week 104 study visit with symptoms indicative of malignancy. Work-up showed pulmonary 
adenocarcinoma and the subject died on Day 833, 3 months beyond the Week 104 data analysis 
window. 
As neoplasms are known AEs of immunosuppressive therapy, this event is considered possibly related 
to the study drug. 
Furthermore, a 75-year old male died due to complications of injuries suffered in an unrelated 
accident, approximately 15 months after completion of study participation. This event is considered 
unrelated to study treatment. 
In summary, of the 14 fatal events reported during and after the DLP of IM103010 and IM103116, 
three in IM103010 and seven in IM103116 up to Month 36 and Month 24 respectively. Two additional 
deaths in each study were reported after these time points. Four events, two in each treatment arm, 
are considered possibly related to the study drug by the Assessor. One additional subject reporting a 
fatal event possibly related to treatment had been treated with both CNI and belatacept. A causal 
assessment is not considered possible in one case.  
No cause of death indicative of a new and unexpected AE of belatacept was reported in any of the 
subjects. As part of the responses to the request for supplementary information, the MAH provided a 
comparison of the IR of deaths, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in IM103010, 
IM103116, IM103008 and IM103027 to allow for comparisons of these parameters at different time 
points after conversion to or de novo treatment with belatacept. The outcome was comparable or 
better in the belatacept arms of the conversion studies compared to the belatacept LI arms of both de 
novo studies.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AESI discussed in the MAH’s Summary of clinical safety were PTLD, malignancies other than PTLD, 
serious infections, Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), tuberculosis (TB) infections, viral 
infections, CNS infections, fungal infections, infusion-related reactions within 24 hours, thrombotic and 
embolic events, autoimmune diseases, and congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema.  
PTLD 
In total, one event of PTLD was reported with belatacept treatment versus none in the CNI arm. The 
subject was EBV positive, but there is no data provided on the donor’s EBV serostatus. Despite that 
EBV negative recipients were allowed to enter study IM103010, no event of PTLD was reported from 
this study.  
Malignancies (other than PTLD) 
The overall IR of malignancies other than PTLD was higher in IM103116 compared to IM103010 and 
higher in the belatacept arms (4.4 vs 3.1 events/100 PY for belatacept and CNI, respectively, in 
IM103116, and 2.9 vs 2.6 events/100 PY in IM103010).  
In total, 55 events of malignancies other than PTLD were reported, 31 in the belatacept arms and 24 in 
the CNI arms. Of those, 46 events (84%) were non-melanoma skin cancers (27 and 19 events in the 
belatacept and CNI arms, respectively).  
Serious infections 
In study IM103010, up to Month 12, the frequency of serious infections was higher in the belatacept 
group (13%) than in the CNI group (8%). No serious infection was reported by more than 1 subject in 
a group, except for pyelonephritis and urinary tract infection (UTI) in 2 subjects each in the belatacept 
group and CMV infection in 2 subjects in the CNI group. 
Up to Month 36 in the ITT-LT population, the frequency of serious infections was similar for the two 
treatment groups: 27% for belatacept and 28% for CNI. The IR of serious infections was 9.02/100 p-y 
for belatacept and 9.58 /100 p-y for CNI. More subjects treated with belatacept experienced serious 
urinary tract infections (9%) than subjects treated with CNI (1%). 
In study IM103116, by the end of the Month 24 safety analysis period, serious infections occurred in a 
similar proportion of subjects in the belatacept conversion (17%) and CNI continuation groups (20%). 
Furthermore, the adjusted exposure rate of serious infections was similar between the 2 treatment 
groups: 10.2 p-y and 12.2/100 p-y for the belatacept and CNI groups, respectively.  
The most commonly reported infections in the belatacept group were Urinary Tract Infection (3.2%) 
and Urosepsis (2.7%). The most commonly reported infections in the CNI group were Urinary Tract 
Infection and Pneumonia (3.2% each). 
The IR of serious infections were largely comparable between the treatment arms in both studies. 
Serious infections are labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
PML 
No event of PML was reported in either study. PML is labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
TB infections 
A single event of tuberculosis was reported. The subject was randomised to the belatacept arm in 
study IM103010. Tuberculosis is labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Viral Infections 
In IM103010, one serious viral infection was reported in the belatacept arm and 5 in the CNI-arm up 
to Month 36. In IM103116, up to Month 24, 14 serious viral infections were reported, 5 in the 
belatacept conversion group and 9 in the CNI continuation group. 
The MAH has provided IR for viral infections in the two conversion studies and the two pivotal de novo 
studies. There is a marked difference in IR of viral infections between IM103010 (12.60/100 PY and 
10.03/100 PY, for belatacept and CNI respectively.) and IM103116 (1.2/100 PY and 2.3/100 PY, 
respectively). The IR reported in IM103010 is more comparable to IRs for viral infections reported for 
the pivotal de novo-studies.  
As part of the responses to request for supplementary information, the MAH provided the IR on “viral 
infections” for IM103116. The IR for “viral infections” was lower in IM103116 than both IM103010 and 
the two pivotal de novo studies. There was no consistent difference between the treatment arms, as 
the IR was higher for belatacept (14.7 vs 11.4 events/ 100 patient years) in IM103010 and lower (8.6 
vs 11.9 events/ 100 patient years) in IM103116.  
The risk of viral infections is reflected in the SmPC.  
CNS infections 
No event of CNS infection was reported in either study. The risk of CNS infections is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Fungal Infections 
One serious fungal infection was reported throughout the studies. This was a fatal event of 
disseminated histoplasmosis in the CNI-arm of IM103116. This event is discussed in the above section 
‘Deaths’. The risk of fungal infections is reflected in the SmPC. 
Infusion-related Reactions Within 24 Hours of the Start of an Infusion 
All infusion-related reactions in either study were reported as non-serious. The risk of infusion-related 
reactions is reflected in the SmPC. 
Thrombotic and Embolic Events 
In IM103010 up to Month 36, two thromboembolic events were reported in the belatacept arm versus 
none in the CNI arm. The corresponding number fort IM103116 at Month 24 were seven events in each 
arm. It is however considered that the event of “thrombotic microangiopathy” reported in the CNI arm 
of IM103116 should not be counted here as this condition has a different aetiology than other 
thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thrombosis and thrombophlebitis are labelled in section 
4.8 of the SmPC for Nulojix.  
Autoimmune Disease 
One event of psoriasis was reported in the belatacept arm of IM103010. This does not affect the safety 
profile of belatacept.  
Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema 
A small number of reports on congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema was reported. There was 
no significant difference between the treatment arms.

Safety of Belatacept in Conversion Use Compared to Use in De Novo Renal Transplantation 
In both conversion studies, all reported safety events, including those related to infection and 
malignancy, were consistent with the safety profile of belatacept as described in the approved labelling 
for use in de novo renal allograft recipients in the phase 3 pivotal studies and the corresponding long-
term extensions for up to 7 years post-transplant. The maintenance dosing regimen―that of 5 mg/kg 
every 4 weeks, as used in both conversion studies, was the same as that administered during the 
maintenance phase of both pivotal phase 3 de novo transplant studies. 
Incidence rates of key AEs of special interest in the conversion studies and de novo studies were 
similar (Table 38). 
Table 38: Incidence Rate of Adverse Events of Special Interest from Studies IM103010, IM103116, 
IM103008, and IM103027 
Laboratory findings 
In total, 93 events of markedly abnormal laboratory values were reported in the belatacept arm 
compared to 95 in the CNI arm up to 24 Months in IM103116. The corresponding values for IM103010 
up to Month 36 was 30 for belatacept and 28 for CNI. Thus, there was no different in the reporting of 
markedly abnormal laboratory values between the treatment arms in either study.  
According to the prespecified definition for “markedly abnormal” laboratory values, “absolute 
lymphopenia” represents <0.5 x 109/L. Absolute lymphopenia was more common in the belatacept 
arms in both studies. The MAH speculates that this may be explained by adjustments of e.g. 
mycophenolate in association with the conversion. Notwithstanding, lymphopenia is labelled in section 
4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency common. 
Hypophosphataemia was more common in the belatacept arm in both studies. Hypophosphataemia is 
labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
In IM103010 as opposed to IM103116, hypermagnesemia of “markedly abnormal” degree was more 
commonly reported in the belatacept arm (n=5 [6%] for belatacept versus n=1 [1%] for CNI at Month 
12, and n=6 [7%] versus n=1 [1%] at Month 36). No such events were reported in IM103116. In 
response to request for supplementary information, the MAH discussed the imbalance in 
hypermagnesemia between the treatment arms in IM103010.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 73/74 
 
 
 
 
No AEs of elevated serum Mg levels or “hypermagnesemia” were reported in IM103010; however, six 
belatacept conversion patients and one CNI continuation patients met the prospectively defined criteria 
for “marked abnormality” at Month 18. Of these subjects, only one elevated value was observed in all 
subjects except in one subject, who reported two elevated values. 
Mean serum magnesium in the belatacept conversion arm increased from 1.46 mEq/L at baseline to 
1.66 mEq/L at Month 3 and remained stable at these levels thereafter. No such increase was seen in 
the CNI continuation arm. The MAH argued that persistent increase in serum Mg levels that was 
observed post-conversion to belatacept may be due to the presence, prior to randomisation, of a 
reversible component of tubular Mg wasting that previously has been described as a manifestation of 
CNI nephrotoxicity. This is not considered plausible. Notwithstanding, no similar increase in serum 
magnesium was seen in IM103116, nor in the two pivotal de novo studies.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In IM103010, three subjects, two in the belatacept arm and one in the CNI arm discontinued study 
treatment due to AEs. 
In study IM103116, the IR of study treatment discontinuation was higher in the belatacept arm, both 
looking at SAAs (2.5 vs 1.5) and total AEs (3.0 vs 2.0). The difference was driven by the PT Kidney 
transplant rejection. In total, 12 subjects discontinued study treatment due to AEs in the belatacept 
arm. Of those, 9 subjects in the belatacept arm (7 SAE and 2 AE) versus none in the CNI-arm reported 
Kidney transplant rejection as the reason for discontinuation.

Post marketing experience 
The first approval for belatacept was granted on 15-Jun-2011 by the FDA in the US. Belatacept was 
approved by the European Commission in the EU initially on 17-Jun-2011. 
Post-marketing reports identifying use in conversion are considered to be off-label use reports. These 
reports are evaluated as part of routine pharmacovigilance on an ongoing basis, and the data are 
summarized in the belatacept periodic safety update reports (PSURs).  
In the most recent PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000311/201906 - reporting period 15-Jun-2016 
through 14-Jun-2019), 59 of the 84 cases of off label use during the reporting period were due to 
conversion from another immunosuppressant agent to belatacept. Examination of AEs from post-
marketing reports involving conversion has not identified risks different from those already described 
for belatacept. 
Overall, review of available post-marketing data presented in the most recent PSUR did not reveal any 
new significant safety findings for belatacept. The post-marketing data were consistent with the safety 
profile of belatacept as previously reported and described in the product label. 
Immunogenicity 
16/18 subjects with BPAR in IM103116 were negative for anti-belatacept-antibodies at all time points. 
Out of 2 remaining BPAR subjects, one subject was positive at baseline and at Day 15. No record of 
ADA testing is available for the other subject.  
3/4 subjects experiencing a fatal event in IM103116 were negative at all time points whereas the 
remaining subject was positive only at baseline.  
The single belatacept-treated subject who developed PTLD tested positive for anti-belatacept antibody, 
but only at baseline. 
One event of infusion-related reaction assessed as related to study drug by the investigator in a 
subject for whom anti-belatacept antibody testing was positive at one or more time points was 
reported. This subject tested positive for anti-belatacept antibodies only at baseline, prior to any 
belatacept exposure. 
In IM103010, one subject met the prospectively defined criteria required to test for NAb and tested 
positive at all points assessed. In IM103116, none of the subjects meeting the criteria for NAb-testing 
tested positive.  
There was no relevant association with positive anti-belatacept antibodies and death, BPAR or infusion-
related reactions. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events 
In both Study IM103010 and IM103116, most subjects in both treatment arms experienced at least 
one AE. In both studies, the number of subjects reporting an AE was slightly higher in the belatacept 
arm (98% vs 94% at Month 36 in IM103010 and 96% vs 92% at Month 24 in IM103116). All AEs 
reported for at least 5% of the subjects in the belatacept arm in either study are already labelled in the 
SmPC for belatacept.

Deaths 
In total, 14 fatal events were reported up to and after the DLP of IM103010 and IM103116. Three 
deaths in IM103010 and seven in IM103116 were reported up to Month 36 and Month 24, respectively, 
and two additional deaths in each study were reported after these time points. Eight fatal events were 
reported in the belatacept arms and six in the CNI arms (see further details in “Death” section). 
Only one fatal event was assessed as “probably associated” by the investigator; the remaining 13 
events were assessed as not related. 
The number of fatal events was comparable between the treatment arms. Four events, two in each 
treatment arm, are considered possibly related to the study drug by the assessors after secondary 
assessment of narratives. One additional subject reporting a fatal event possibly related to treatment 
had been treated with both CNI and belatacept. No cause of death indicative of a new and unexpected 
AE of belatacept was reported in any of the subjects.  
Upon request, the MAH has provided a comprehensive a table of the IR of deaths, SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation in IM103010, IM103116, IM103008 and IM103027 to allow for comparisons 
of these parameters at different time points after conversion to or de novo treatment with belatacept. 
The outcome was comparable or better in the belatacept arms of the conversion studies compared to 
the belatacept LI arms of both de novo studies. 
Serious adverse events (SAE) 
In IM103116, 48% of the subejcts in the belatacept arm and 43% in the CNI arm reported a SAE. The 
corresponding numbers for IM103010 Month 12 was 24% and 19%, respectively and for Month 36 
46% and 44%. 
The spectrum of SAEs reported in the belatacept arm of both studies is consistent with the known 
safety profile of belatacept. No new and unexpected SAEs are reported.  
Adverse event of special interest (AESI) 
AESI were PTLD, malignancies other than PTLD, serious infections, PML, TB infections, viral infections, 
CNS infections, fungal infections, infusion-related reactions within 24 hours, thrombotic and embolic 
events, autoimmune diseases, and congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema. 
In total, one event of PTLD was reported with belatacept treatment versus none in the CNI arm. The 
subject was EBV positive, but there is no data provided on the donor’s EBV serostatus. PTLD is already 
labelled in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. No further updates are considered necessary. 
The overall IR of Malignancies other than PTLD was higher in IM103116 compared to IM103010 and 
higher in the belatacept arms (4.4 vs 3.1 events/100 PY for belatacept and CNI, respectively, in 
IM103116, and 2.9 vs 2.6 events/100 PY in IM103010).  
In total, 55 events of malignancies other than PTLD were reported, 31 in the belatacept arms and 24 in 
the CNI arms. Of those, 46 events (84%) were non-melanoma skin cancers (27 and 19 events in the 
belatacept and CNI arms, respectively). Such malignancies are labelled with the frequency common in 
the Nulojix SmPC. The differences between the treatment arms was entirely attributable to a higher 
rate of cutaneous basal cell cancer in the belatacept conversion versus CNI continuation groups (11 
events [5.0%] versus 5 events [2.3%], respectively). The MAH has clarified that there were more 
subjects in the belatacept arm with either a prior history of skin cancer or a family of skin cancer which 
may indicate a higher risk for such events in the belatacept arm. Furthermore, two of the events were 
diagnosed within 5 days after the first dose of belatacept, precluding a causal association. All events 
have been presented in detail to the independent Data Monitoring Committee for study IM103116; 
their conclusion was that this imbalance did not represent a new safety signal. Such malignancies are 
labelled with the frequency common in the Nulojix SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 76/77 
 
 
 
Of the remaining malignancies reported in the belatacept arms, only Papillary thyroid carcinoma is not 
specifically labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, the general increased risk of malignancies is 
reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The IRs of Serious infections were largely comparable between the treatment arms in both studies. A 
single event of Tuberculosis was reported. The subject was randomised to the belatacept arm in study 
IM103010. One serious Fungal infection was reported throughout the studies. This was a fatal event of 
disseminated histoplasmosis in the CNI-arm of IM103116. 
In IM103010, one serious viral infection was reported in the belatacept arm and 5 in the CNI-arm up 
to Month 36. In IM103116, up to Month 24, 14 serious viral infections were reported, 5 in the 
belatacept conversion group and 9 in the CNI continuation group. The MAH has provided IRs for viral 
infections in the two conversion studies and the two pivotal de novo studies. There is a difference in IR 
of Viral infections between IM103010 (14.7/100 PY and 11.4/100 PY, for belatacept and CNI 
respectively.) and IM103116 (8.6/100 PY and 11.9/100 PY, respectively). There was no consistent 
difference between the treatment arms, as the IR was higher for belatacept in IM103010 and lower in 
IM103116.  
No events of PML or CNS infections were reported. A small number of reports on Congestive heart 
failure, Pulmonary oedema and Thromboembolic events with no clinically significant difference between 
the treatment arms was reported throughout the studies. All Infusion-related reactions in either study 
were reported as non-serious. 
The MAH has provided a summary over IR of PTLD, other malignancies and serious infections in the 
two conversion studies compared to the two pivotal de novo studies. The results from the conversion 
studies should be compared to the “less intensive” (LI)-arm of the de novo studies as it is the LI 
posology that is approved and used in the conversion studies. Due to some differences in the eligibility 
criteria between IM103008 (standard criteria donors) and IM103027 (extended criteria donors), the IR 
for all events except Viral infections are higher in IM103027. The conversion studies could be 
considered more similar to IM103008. The IR of PTLD was slightly higher in IM103008, whereas the IR 
was lower for malignancies and slightly lower for serious infections in IM103008 compared to both 
conversion studies. Taken together, the results from the conversion studies are considered comparable 
to the results from the de novo studies concerning the key AESI. 
In summary, there were no unexpected finding in the review of AESI in the two conversion studies. 
The AESI are included in section 4.4 and/or 4.8 of the SmPC of Nulojix. No further action is required.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
In summary, 93 events of markedly abnormal laboratory values were reported in the belatacept arm 
compared to 95 in the CNI arm up to 24 Months in IM103116. The corresponding values for IM103010 
up to Month 36 was 30 for belatacept and 28 for CNI. Thus, there was no different in the reporting of 
markedly abnormal laboratory values between the treatment arms in either study. 
Hypophosphataemia and Lymphopenia were more commonly reported in the belatacept arm in both 
studies. Both AEs are labelled in section 4.8 of the Nulojix SmPC.  
In IM103010 as opposed to IM103116, hypermagnesemia of “markedly abnormal” degree was more 
commonly reported in the belatacept arm (n=5 [6%] for belatacept versus n=1 [1%] for CNI at Month 
12, and n=6 [7%] versus n=1 [1%] at Month 36. No such events were reported in IM103116. 
Hypermagnesemia is not labelled for belatacept. No similar increase in serum magnesium was seen in 
IM103116, nor in the two pivotal de novo studies. The MAH has not proposed any further actions with 
respect to the elevated magnesium values in IM103010. This is agreed by the CHMP.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In IM103010, three subjects, two in the belatacept arm and one in the CNI arm discontinued study 
treatment due to AEs. 
In study IM103116, the IR of study treatment discontinuation was higher in the belatacept arm, both 
looking at SAEs (2.5 vs 1.5) and total AEs (3.0 vs 2.0). The difference was mainly driven by the 
preferred term (PT) Kidney transplant rejection. In total, 12 subjects discontinued study treatment due 
to AEs in the belatacept arm. Of those, 9 subjects in the belatacept arm (7 SAE and 2 AE) versus none 
in the CNI-arm reported Kidney transplant rejection as the reason for discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity 
One subject in study IM103010 tested positive for NAb to belatacept and no NAb positive subjects 
were identified in study IM103116. There was no relevant association with positive anti-belatacept 
antibodies and death, BPAR or infusion-related reactions. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new and unexpected safety findings were identified for belatacept in the conversion studies. The 
safety profile of belatacept in the conversion setting was consistent with the known safety profile of the 
product. No risks different from those already described for belatacept were identified from reports of 
off label conversions from other immunosuppressive therapies, according to the most recent PSUR for 
belatacept (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000311/201906). It is also not expected that the safety profile of 
belatacept used in a conversion setting would differ in a relevant way from the safety profile of 
belatacept used in a de novo setting. The sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated 
accordingly.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 18.0 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes are also made to the product information to bring it in line with the QRD template version 
10.1 and requirement on sodium excipients is added. Editorial changes have been made in the 
labelling. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
The readability of the PL of Nulojix (belatacept), in English, was assessed during the 
assessment of the initial MAA and accepted by CHMP; 
The new indication that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of administration and 
has a similar safety profile as the previously approved indication (i.e., key safety messages for 
the existing and new applied for indication are essentially the same); 
•  Administration of Nulojix is done by a health care professional. The instructions for dose 
calculation, preparation, administration, storage and disposal that are currently reflected in the 
approved PL were also successfully tested as part of the user consultation performed for the 
initial MAA and remain unchanged; 
• 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested 
one. 
Overall, the proposed leaflet shares large text sections with the reference one. The modifications now 
proposed in the package leaflet (i.e., those relevant to the new indication) do not represent major 
changes. This is agreed by the CHMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal transplantation is the preferred treatment for ESRD because it confers improved survival and 
quality of life over dialysis. 
In 2017, more than 88,000 subjects across Europe started renal replacement therapy, i.e. starting 
dialysis or receiving a pre-emptive renal transplantation (a renal transplantation without preceding 
dialysis) for ESRD, according to the 2017 European renal association/ European Dialysis and 
Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Annual report3. Common causes of ESRD include hypertension, 
diabetes and primary renal diseases, e.g. glomerulonephritis. Renal transplantation is the most 
effective treatment for ESRD; however, requires lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent 
immune-mediated allograft injury. On 31 December 2017, over 200,000 subjects in the ERA-EDTA 
registry were living with a functioning graft after renal transplantation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
With renal transplantation, maintenance rejection prophylaxis typically consists of a triple 
immunosuppression therapy including a CNI, most commonly TAC or CsA, an antimetabolite (most 
often mycophenolate) and steroids. However, the CNIs have been shown to directly contribute to long-
term allograft loss and death, because they are inherently nephrotoxic, and may also contribute to the 
development or exacerbation of cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
immunosuppressive agents that can provide control of the alloimmune response comparable to CNIs 
without the renal and cardiovascular toxicities that may contribute to long-term graft loss and death. 
Belatacept represents a class of selective co-stimulatory immunomodulators approved in the EU in 
2011 for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults receiving a renal transplant, i.e., treatment with 
belatacept should be initiated in immediate association to renal transplantation, as a substitution for a 
CNI in a triple immunosuppressive therapy. However, according to the MAH, it is currently estimated 
that approximately 80% of belatacept in clinical practice is used in conversion from a CNI-based 
therapy to belatacept, months to years after the transplantation. The MAH therefore proposed a 
modification to the current indication statement to include the conversion use. Of note, the risk of graft 
loss and/or acute rejections is highest in the early post-transplantation period, slowly decreasing over 
6-12 months. This period is already covered by the approved indication. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of belatacept in the conversion setting was evaluated in two studies, the pivotal 
phase-3 study IM103116 and the supporting phase-2 study IM103010. 
IM103116 was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study. 446 subjects on CNI-
based regimens were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either convert to treatment with belatacept 5 mg/kg 
IV on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and every 28 days, or to continue treatment with their established CNI. 
Subjects randomised to belatacept were to discontinue CNIs on Day 29. The duration of study

participation was 24 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for safety post last dose. The 
primary (descriptive) composite endpoint was the proportion of subjects who survived with a 
functioning graft at Month 24. Mean change in cGFR from baseline to 24 months post randomisation 
and BPAR were secondary endpoints. 
IM103010 was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study. 84 subjects were 
randomised to conversion to belatacept as described for IM103116 and 89 to continue treatment with 
CNI. The duration of the study was 12 months with a subsequent 8-week follow-up period for safety 
evaluation. The primary (descriptive) endpoint was renal function (change in eGFR from baseline) at 
12 months. 12 Month survival with functional graft and BPAR were secondary endpoints. 
All subjects who completed the 12-month phase of the initial study were eligible to participate in a LTE. 
In the LTE-population (ITT-LT), baseline values for the subset of subjects entering the LTE were used 
as baseline; therefore e.g. “baseline cGFR” in the IM103010 ITT population differs slightly from 
“baseline cGFR” in the IM103010 ITT-LT population.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
None of the studies used formal statistical hypothesis testing; therefore, all data presented below are 
descriptive.  
The efficacy data indicate that conversion from CNI to belatacept did not impair graft or subject 
survival up to 24 and 36 months, respectively, in IM103116 and IM103010 studies. In IM103116, at 
Month 24 the proportion of patients surviving with a functioning graft was similar in the belatacept 
conversion (98.2%; 219/223) and CNI continuation (97.3%; 217/223) groups. Four patients (1.8%) in 
each group had died and two (0.9%) in the CNI continuation group had lost a graft. In IM103010, at 
Month 12, all of 84 patients (100%) in the belatacept conversion group and 98.9% (88/89) patients in 
the CNI continuation group had survived with a functioning graft. Of the 81 patients in each group who 
entered the LTE period (ITT-LT subpopulation), 97% (79/81) in the belatacept conversion and 98.8% 
(80/81) in the CNI continuation group had survived with a functioning graft by Month 36. 
In both studies, there was a larger improvement in mean cGFR change compared to baseline in the 
belatacept arm. In IM103116, when analysed with imputation to zero for death and graft loss, values 
for adjusted mean cGFR at Month 24 were 55.5 and 48.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the belatacept conversion 
and CNI continuation groups, respectively. The corresponding adjusted change from baseline cGFR 
values were +5.2 and -1.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. At Month 12, the mean (SD) change in cGFR 
from baseline was +7.0 (12.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the belatacept conversion group (N=84) as 
compared to +2.1 (10.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the CNI continuation group (N=89). 
With regard to BPAR, although a higher incidence of BPAR was shown comparing belatacept and CNI in 
the conversion studies, the data does not indicate a higher rate of BPAR in the conversion studies than 
in the pivotal de novo studies.  
In IM103116, at Month 12, BPAR was reported for 18/223 patients (8.1%) in the belatacept conversion 
group and 4/223 patients (1.8%) in the CNI continuation group. At Month 24, there were no further 
cases of BPAR in the belatacept conversion group, but 5 additional cases were reported in the CNI 
continuation group (total of 9/223 (4%) at Month 24). The majority of the BPAR cases reported in the 
belatacept conversion group occurred during the first 6 months; all were successfully treated with no 
subsequent graft loss. The overall severity of BPAR events was greater following belatacept conversion 
compared to those in the CNI continuation group.  
In IM103010, at Month 12 BPAR was reported in 7.1% (6/84) patients in the belatacept conversion 
group and none in the CNI continuation group. One case of BPAR was reported in the belatacept 
conversion group and three cases of BPAR were reported in the CNI continuation group during the LTE

Page 81/82 
 
 
 
period; in the ITT-LT subpopulation up to 36 months, BPAR was reported in 6.2% (5/81) vs 3.7% 
(3/81) of patients in the belatacept conversion vs CNI continuation groups, respectively. None of the 
BPAR events was of Banff grade III severity. One patient in each group with BPAR experienced 
subsequent graft loss.  
Overall, in the conversion setting, the number of BPAR reported after Month 12 were comparable 
between the treatment arms indicating that the increased risk of BPAR with belatacept compared to 
CNI is not maintained. This is consistent with the finding that the development of de novo donor 
specific antibodies, considered a risk factor for rejection and graft loss, was smaller in the belatacept 
arm of the conversion studies (Table 25).  
The section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that conversion of clinically stable patients 
receiving a CNI-based maintenance regimen to a belatacept-based regimen may initially increase the 
risk of acute rejection. Closer monitoring for acute rejection is recommended for at least 6 months 
following conversion to belatacept, as per local standard of care. The section 5.1 of the SmPC has also 
been updated to reflect the above conversion studies results. 
Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints in both studies included effect on lipid profiles, new 
onset of diabetes, blood pressure and self-reported quality of life-assessments. The MAH does not 
make any claim in the SmPC concerning these outcomes, which is agreed by the CHMP and in line with 
the SmPC guideline. The differences between the treatment arms were generally modest and no safety 
concern was raised by the results. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The conversion studies (IM103116, IM103010) showed weaknesses regarding the study design (open 
label) and statistical methodology such as inadequate statistical model for testing a non-inferiority 
hypothesis between the descriptive objectives and the used inferential statistical methods.  
However, CHMP considered that these did not have an impact on the data integrity and that the 
presented descriptive results could allow for a sufficiently robust assessment of the benefit-risk 
balance of Nulojix in the proposed indication (see “Discussion on clinical efficacy”). 
The proposed wording of section 4.1 of the SmPC is “Nulojix, in combination with corticosteroids and a 
mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult recipients of a renal 
transplant”. However, the patient population included in the conversion studies was narrowed. Indeed, 
the eligibility criteria restrict the study population by excluding subjects with cGFR <30 (<35 in 
IM103010) and >75 mL/min/1.73m2 and limiting inclusion of subjects with a history of acute rejections 
and high immunological risk. It is assumed that the upper limit of cGFR for inclusion was set to identify 
subjects with beginning CNI toxicity, which is considered a subpopulation with a need for non-CNI 
based immunosuppression. Likewise, it is supposed that the lower cGFR limitation was set to exclude 
subjects with extensive chronic allograft nephropathy, less likely to benefit from conversion to another 
immunosuppressive therapy. However, there are other clinical situations in which the use of belatacept 
may be advantageous, for example in subjects with AEs on CNI. Furthermore, in subjects with poor 
compliance, it is agreed with the MAH that the use of belatacept given in a health care setting every 
four weeks would be a better option. There is no reason to assume that the efficacy of belatacept in 
the conversion setting in subjects with better renal function than 75 mL/min/1.73m2 would be different 
from that reported in the studies. In the original MAA, no clinically relevant effects on belatacept 
clearance was seen with decreased renal function. This is reflected in the approved SmPC including a 
wording in section 4.2 that no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment or 
undergoing dialysis. The CHMP agrees therefore that the results from the studies can be extrapolated 
to subjects with all levels of renal function and therefore, the broad population in the proposed wording 
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 82/83 
 
 
 
of section 4.1 of the SmPC is accepted. The eligibility criteria further restrict the study population by 
excluding subjects with high immunological risk. This has been addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
which states that “There are no data on conversion in patients considered to be at higher 
immunological risk as these were excluded from the conversion studies based on protocol defined 
criteria related to their previous rejection history (see section 5.1). Such patients may initially be at 
further risk of acute rejection following conversion to belatacept than those who were actually studied. 
In subjects with high immunological risk, conversion should only be considered when the potential 
benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks.” 
In summary, there are no remaining uncertainties about favourable effects of Nulojix in the proposed 
indication.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In both conversion studies, the number of subjects reporting an AE was slightly higher in the 
belatacept arm compared to placebo (98% vs 94% at Month 36 in IM103010 and 96% vs 92% at 
Month 24 in IM103116). All AEs reported for at least 5% of the subjects in the belatacept arm in either 
study are already labelled in the SmPC for belatacept. 
In total, 14 fatal events were reported up to and after the DLP of IM103010 and IM103116. Three 
deaths in IM103010 and seven in IM103116 were reported up to Month 36 and Month 24, respectively, 
and two additional deaths in each study were reported after these time points. Eight fatal events were 
reported in the belatacept arms and six in the CNI arms 
Only one fatal event was assessed as “probably associated” by  the investigator; the remaining 13 
events were assessed as not related.  
In IM103116, 48% (n=107) of the subjects in the belatacept arm and 43% (n=95) in the CNI arm 
reported a SAE. The corresponding numbers for IM103010 Month 12 was 24% and 19%, respectively, 
and 46% and 44% for Month 36.  
The system organ class (SOC) with the most reported SAEs in both studies and both treatment arms 
was Infections and infestations, reported by approximately 60% of the subjects with a SAE in 
IM103010 at Month 36. In IM103116, the three SOCs with most commonly reported SAEs in the 
belatacept arms were Infections and infestations (37 subjects), Immunosystem disorders (19 subjects) 
and Neoplasms (18 subjects). In the CNI arm, 44 subjects reported SAEs in the SOC Infections and 
infestations, 9 subjects in the SOC Immunosystem disorders and 13 subjects in the SOC. Of note, all 
SAE in the SOC Immunosystem disorders for belatacept represented Kidney rejection. 
In IM103010, three subjects, two in the belatacept arm and one in the CNI arm discontinued study 
treatment due to AEs. 
In study IM103116, the IR of study treatment discontinuation was higher in the belatacept arm. The 
difference was mainly driven by the PT Kidney transplant rejection. In total, 12 subjects discontinued 
study treatment due to adverse events in the belatacept arm. Of those, 9 subjects in the belatacept 
arm (7 SAE and 2 AE) versus none in the CNI-arm reported Kidney transplant rejection as the reason 
for discontinuation. 
Among the AESI were PTLD, malignancies other than PTLD, serious infections, PML, TB infections, viral 
infections, CNS infections, fungal infections and infusion-related reactions within 24 hours. 
In total, one event of PTLD in an EBV seropositive subject was reported with belatacept treatment 
versus none in the CNI arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 83/84 
 
 
 
55 events of malignancies other than PTLD were reported, 31 in the belatacept arms and 24 in the CNI 
arms of the studies. Of those, 46 events (84%) were non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell 
cancer (27 and 19 events in the belatacept and CNI arms, respectively).  
The IRs of serious infections were largely comparable between the treatment arms in both studies 
(27% for belatacept and 28% for CNI up to Month 36 in IM103010, and 17% for belatacept and 20% 
for CNI up to Month 24 in IM103116). A single event of tuberculosis was reported. The subject was 
randomised to the belatacept arm in study IM103010. One serious fungal infection was reported 
throughout the studies. This was a fatal event of disseminated histoplasmosis in the CNI-arm of 
IM103116. 
In IM103010, one serious viral infection was reported in the belatacept arm and 5 in the CNI-arm up 
to Month 36. In IM103116, up to Month 24, 14 serious viral infections were reported, 5 in the 
belatacept conversion group and 9 in the CNI continuation group.  
No events of PML or CNS infections were reported.  
In summary, 93 events of markedly abnormal laboratory values were reported in the belatacept arm 
compared to 95 in the CNI arm up to 24 Months in IM103116. The corresponding values for IM103010 
up to Month 36 was 30 for belatacept and 28 for CNI. Hypophosphataemia and Lymphopenia were 
more commonly reported in the belatacept arm in both studies.  
No subject in either study was reported with neutralising antibodies to belatacept. There was no 
relevant association with positive anti-belatacept antibodies and death, BPAR or infusion-related 
reactions. 
The overall safety profile of belatacept in the two conversion studies was consistent with the known 
safety profile in the existing clinical population from studies in newly transplanted patients. No new 
adverse drug reaction is therefore proposed to be included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The causal attribution of deaths was questioned during the assessment. Four events, two in each 
treatment arm, are considered possibly related to the study drug. One additional subject reporting a 
fatal event possibly related to treatment had been treated with both CNI and belatacept. However, this 
does not affect the overall conclusion, as no cause of death indicative of a new and unexpected AE of 
belatacept was reported in any of the subjects. 
The MAH addressed during the procedure a small number of issues regarding safety, for example the 
IR of deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in the conversion studies compared to the 
pivotal de novo studies, an increased rate of non-melanoma skin cancers in the belatacept arm of 
IM103010 and the IR of viral infections in different studies. No further actions are considered 
warranted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Belatacept is approved since 2011 in adult subjects receiving a renal transplant. In this context, 
belatacept is used as a substitution for a CNI in a triple immunosuppressive therapy “de novo’” setting. 
The intended new population in the conversion setting of adult renal transplant recipients, is similar to 
the approved population in all aspects except that these patients have received CNI since the 
transplantation. Therefore, the present indication is supported to a large extent by existing data. 
Therefore, the lack of formal statistical testing in the conversion studies was found acceptable to the 
CHMP.  
Data from the conversion studies indicate that the efficacy of belatacept in the conversion setting is 
comparable to the efficacy in the approved “de novo” setting concerning the key efficacy endpoints 
survival with functioning graft. In both studies, 98% of the subjects in the belatacept arms survived 
with a functioning graft up to Month 24 and Month 36 for IM103116 and IM103010, respectively. 
These results strongly support efficacy of belatacept treatment in the conversion setting. The number 
of BPAR was numerically lower in both treatment arms in the conversion studies compared to the “de 
novo”-studies. This finding was expected as most episodes of acute rejections are normally reported in 
the early post-transplant period. Altogether, the available data support the efficacy claim in the 
proposed extended indication. No new and unexpected safety findings were identified in the conversion 
setting studies compared to the known safety profile of belatacept. 
It is notable that the proposed target population is broader than the study population, as eligibility 
criteria included restriction both to renal function and immunological risk. It is however considered 
acceptable to extrapolate the study results to all levels of renal function. There is no reason to assume 
that the efficacy of belatacept in the conversion setting in subjects with better renal function than 75 
mL/min/1.73m2 would be different from that reported in the studies. Furthermore, data provided in the 
original MAA showed no clinically relevant effects on belatacept clearance was seen with decreased 
renal function. The restrictions to immunological risk have been reflected in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266477/2021  
Page 86/87 
 
 
 
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data from the 2 clinical studies in the conversion setting indicated that conversion from 
CNI to belatacept did not impair graft or subject survival up to 24 and 36 months, respectively, in the 
conversion setting. In both studies, there was a larger improvement in mean cGFR change compared 
to baseline in the belatacept arm. Furthermore, although a higher incidence of BPAR was shown 
comparing belatacept and CNI in the conversion studies, the data does not indicate a higher rate of 
BPAR in the conversion studies than in the pivotal de novo studies. The majority of BPAR in the 
belatacept arm occurred during the first year of treatment.  
The overall safety profile of belatacept in the two conversion studies was consistent with the known 
safety profile in the existing clinical population in de novo renal transplant populations 
In conclusion, efficacy and safety in the conversion setting is comparable to the approved “de novo” 
indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of belatacept used in conversion from a CNI-based regimen to a 
belatacept-based regimen post transplantation in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic 
acid, for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult recipients of a renal transplant is positive.

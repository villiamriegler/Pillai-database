excretion and exposure to emtricitabine was significantly 
increased in patients with renal insufficiency.  Dose or dose 
interval adjustment is required in all patients with 
creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min. 
Table 1 in section 4.2 Posology and method of 
administration of the SmPC provides dose interval 
adjustment guidelines for the 200 mg hard capsules 
according to the degree of renal insufficiency.  The safety 
and efficacy of the dose interval adjustments to every 72 or 
96 hours in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min 
have not been clinically evaluated.  Therefore, clinical 
response to treatment and renal function should be closely 
monitored in these patients. 
Renal function 
Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney via 
glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  
Emtricitabine exposure may be markedly increased in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) receiving daily doses of 200 mg 
emtricitabine as hard capsules or 240 mg as the oral 
solution.  Consequently, either a dose interval adjustment 
(using Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules) or a reduction in the 
daily dose of emtricitabine (using Emtriva 10 mg/ml oral 
solution) is required in all patients with creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min.  The safety and efficacy of the dose interval 
adjustment guidelines provided in section 4.2 are based on 
single dose pharmacokinetic data and modelling and have 
not been clinically evaluated.  Therefore, clinical response 
to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored 
in patients treated with emtricitabine at prolonged dosing 
intervals.

with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.

BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-

with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent 
transmission should be taken in accordance with national 
guidelines.

the SmPC was updated to not to discontinue Emtriva in 
patients co-infected with HIV and HBV with advanced liver 
disease or cirrhosis since post treatment exacerbations of 
hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
The term 'angioedema', was included in section 4.8 
following a review of angioedema. This review was 
submitted by the MAH for Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir 
DF) and identified two cases of angioedema with Truvada, 
with indirect evidence of a causal association with 
emtricitabine (a negative rechallenge to the tenofovir 
component of Truvada).  In addition, there were four cases 
of a positive rechallenge to Truvada which should also be 
considered as possibly causally related, as the positive 
result could have been in response to either the tenofovir 
DF or the emtricitabine component.

on treatment with emtricitabine, 28 cases were identified 
up to 19 June 2006. Based on these cases a causal 
relationship between emtricitabine and anaemia was 
reasonably suspected. However, detailed description of the 
analysis performed in adult study data was needed to draw 
a definitive conclusion. The additional data provided from 3 
trials suggested that emtricitabine can cause Grade 1 and 
Grade 2 anaemia, which occurs in between 0.5 and 1.0% of 
patients. Based on the available data, it was agreed to add 
"anaemia" to the list of uncommon adverse reactions to 
emtricitabine treatment in adult patient. Anaemia was 
already listed as common adverse reaction with 
emtricitabine treatment in paediatric patients.

An open label pharmacokinetic study of emtricitabine over 
results of a study evaluating the pharmacokinetics 
and safety of emtricitabine in neonates and young 
infants over the first 3 months of life, at CHMP 
request further to the assessment of this study in 
November 2006. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
the first 3 months of life following multiple dose 
administration in children born to HIV 1 infected mothers 
was completed by 20 of the 22 neonates enrolled. All the 
20 neonates received two 4-day courses of emtricitabine 
oral solution between the first week of life and 3 months of 
age at a dose level of 3 mg/kg once daily (half of the 
approved dose for infants aged more than 4 months).  
Results showed that steady state clearance increased with 
age over the first 3 months of life and AUC decreased in 
parallel. Moreover, plasma emtricitabine exposure (AUC) in 
infants up to 3 months of age who received 3 mg/kg 
emtricitabine once daily was similar to that observed using 
6 mg/kg daily doses in HIV-infected adults and children 
aged 4 months and over. This information is now included 
Page 22/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the SPC. Furthermore, it is also mentioned that there is 
no efficacy data and only very few data in terms of safety 
are available for infants aged below 4 months. Therefore, 
Emtriva is not recommended for use in those aged less 
than four months.

(including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has 
occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease 
and/or in patients with long term use of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all 
available data the CHMP agreed that this information 
should now be included in the SPC and PL of all

In addition, section 2 of the Portuguese PL was 
amended regarding a spelling correction. 
September 2004 concluded that having demonstrated that 
there is no effect on the pharmacokinetics, the MAH should 
amend the SPC in accordance. 
Therefore, section 5.2 of  the SPC was updated to reflect

antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment.  
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not yet been 
detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of 
CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection 
(OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for 
the complications most feared in this context; CMV-
retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  An additional reason for 
treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially, is the 
great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due 
to drug interactions.  
The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune 
system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and 
the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory 
reaction is considering to be important to the clinical

assessment of MAH's responses and discussions held at the 
Pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, a class 
labelling text regarding the reactivation of the immune 
system of HIV-infected patients treated with any type of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) was agreed to be 
implemented in all anti-retroviral product information.

and/ or post-natal exposure to NRTIs was first raised in 
1999 following the identification of 8 cases of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in uninfected children included in a clinical trial. 
The MAHs for all NRTIs were asked to provide preclinical 
data on the mitochondrial toxicity and a review of adverse 
events potentially attributable to mitochondrial toxicity in 
children exposed in utero and / or post-natally to NRTIs. 
Following the assessment of the submitted data and 
discussions held at the PhVWP and CPMP, a class labelling 
wording was agreed by the CPMP in November 2003 to be 
implemented in all NRTIs product information. In addition, 
the storage conditions in section 6.4 of the SPC and section 
5 of the PL were updated in line with EMEA/QRD templates. 
The list of the local representatives for the current 
European Members States and for the 10 new accession

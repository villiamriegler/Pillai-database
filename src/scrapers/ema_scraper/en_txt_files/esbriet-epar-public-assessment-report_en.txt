2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF)  is  a  rare  disease  of  unknown  etiology  that  is  characterised  by 
progressive fibrosis of the interstitium of the lung, leading to decreasing lung volume and progressive 
pulmonary  insufficiency.  IPF  is  a  well-recognised  and  distinct  interstitial  lung  disease  with  unique 
histopathologic,  clinical  and  prognostic  characteristics  (American  Thoracic  Society/European 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 5/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respiratory  Society  (ATS/ERS),  2000;  ATS/ERS,  2002).  IPF  is  most  prevalent  in  middle  aged  and 
elderly  patients,  and  usually  presents  between  the  ages  of  40  and  70  years  (ATS/ERS  2000).  Many 
patients  experience  long  periods  of  relative  stability  but  acute  episodes  of  rapid  respiratory 
deterioration may result in death. Most patients die of respiratory failure. Median survival, as described 
across a range of studies, is only 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. Despite continued improvement in the 
understanding  of  the  pathogenesis  of  IPF,  there  remain  no  approved  therapies  or  medications  in  the 
European Union, nor has the prognosis been substantially altered over the last two decades. 
About the product 
Pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) is an immunosuppressant (ATC code L04AX05). The 
mechanism  of  action  has  not  been  fully  established.  However,  existing  data  suggest  that  pirfenidone 
exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties.  
The  proposed  indication  for  pirfenidone  is  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  IPF.  The  finally 
approved indication is as follows: “Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).” 
The  drug  product  is  an  immediate  release  hard  capsule  containing  267  mg  of  pirfenidone  drug 
substance.  The  recommended  daily  dose  is  three  267 mg  capsules  three  times  a  day  with  food  for  a 
total  of  2403 mg/day.  The  posology  stated  in  the  SmPC  requires  dose  titration  to  the  MDD  over  two 
weeks: days 1 to 7 – 801 mg/day, days 8 to 14- 1602 mg/day, and day 15 onwards – 2403 mg/day. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application has been submitted as complete and independent application according to Article 8.3 
of  Directive  2001/83/EC  meaning  that  it  includes  complete  quality  data,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data 
based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and  bibliographic  literature  supporting  certain  tests  or 
studies. 
Pirfenidone was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  in  the  following indication:  the  treatment 
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is estimated to affect not more than 3 in 10,000 persons in 
the EU population.  
With  regard  to  the  paediatric  development,  a  product  specific  waiver  for  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric 
population  has  been  granted  on  the  grounds  that  the  disease  or  condition,  Idiopathic  Pulmonary 
Fibrosis, for which the specific medicinal product as intended, occurs only in the adult population. 
For  the  development  of  pirfenidone  Protocol  Assistance  was  received  from  the  CHMP  pertaining  to 
non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Esbriet is presented as hard gelatin capsules containing 267 mg of pirfenidone as the active substance. 
The  capsules  have  a  blue  opaque  body  and  gold  opaque  cap  imprinted  with  “InterMune  267 mg”  in 
brown ink and contain a white to pale yellow powder. 
Excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of  Esbriet  are  well  known  excipients  used  in  capsule  preparations 
such  as  microcrystalline  cellulose,  croscarmellose  sodium,  povidone,  magnesium  stearate  (present  in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 6/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
capsule content); gelatin and titanium dioxide (E 171) and indigo carmine (E132) (present in capsule 
shell: body); gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171), yellow iron oxide (E172), red iron oxide (E172) (present 
in  capsule  shell:  body)  and  shellac,  iron  oxide  black  (E172),  iron  oxide  red  (E172),  iron  oxide  yellow 
(E172) (present in brown ink S-1-16530). 
The  capsules  are  packed  in  polyvinyl chloride / polyethylene / polychlorotrifluoroethylene /  aluminium 
foil  (PVC/PE/PCTFE/alu)  blisters  or  in  white  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  (250 ml)  with 
child - resistant closure system. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Pirfenidone  is  chemically  designated  as  5-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-1(H)-pyridone  and  has  the  following 
structure: 
Pirfenidone is white to pale yellow powder. It is freely soluble in methanol, ethyl alcohol, acetone, and 
chloroform,  sparingly  soluble  in  1.0  N  HCl,  water  and  1.0  N  NaOH.  Dissolution  in  water  is  pH 
independent.  Pirfenidone  does  not  possess  any  chiral  centres  and  therefore  is  not  subject  to 
stereoisomerism.  The  acid  dissociation  constant,  pKa,  was  calculated  to  be  (-0.2  ±  0.6)  and  is 
consistent  with  the  observation  that  pirfenidone  behaves  as  a  neutral  compound  in  aqueous 
environment. The substance is not hygroscopic. Melting range is between 106oC and 112oC. 
Pirfenidone primarily exists in a single stable crystalline form designated as Form A. Sufficient evidence 
was provided to prove that the form A is obtained by the utilised manufacturing process. 
Particle size distribution of the active substance is controlled. 
Manufacture 
Information  about  manufacturing  process  of  pirfenidone  has  been  provided  using  Active  Substance 
Master File (ASMF) procedure. The synthesis is simple and consists of two steps. Sufficient information 
regarding  the  manufacturing  process,  materials,  critical  steps  and  intermediates,  process  validation 
and manufacturing process development have been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF. 
Confirmation of the chemical structure of pirfenidone was provided by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR as well 
as  by  mass  spectral  analysis.  The  IR,  NMR  and  MS  spectrum  assignations  were  consistent  with  the 
declared chemical structure.  
In  addition  the  potential  for  polymorphism  and  other  solid-state  forms  of  pirfenidone  has  been 
investigated. The pirfenidone drug substance was characterised by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder 
diffraction  (XRPD),  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC),  dynamic  vapour  sorption  (DVS),  and 
thermogravimetry  coupled  with  Fourier-transformed  infrared  spectroscopy  (TG-FTIR).  Particle  size 
distribution  profile  was  also  investigated.  Laser  diffraction  particle  size  distribution  analysis  and  data 
for various particle sizes for a representative batch of pirfenidone was provided.  
Potential  impurities  have  been  well  discussed  in  relation  to  their  origin  (raw  material,  manufacturing 
process  and  degradation  products)  and  potential  carry-over  into  the  final  drug  substance.  A  very 
detailed  investigation  has  been  carried  out  in  all  possible  related  substances  and  inorganic  impurities 
that may be present in the drug substance. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 7/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  possibility  of  genotoxic  impurities  has  been  considered.  Results  of  structural  alert  screening  and 
genotoxicity testing confirm that potential genotoxicity of impurities in pirfenidone was not a concern. 
Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  physical  appearance,  identification  (IR  and  UV), 
water  content  (Karl  Fisher),  residue  on  ignition,  sulphated  ash,  heavy  metals,  related  substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), loss on drying, particle size distribution and microbiological purity (total aerobic 
microbiological  count,  total  combined  yeast  and  mould  count,  specified  microorganisms:  Escherichia 
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp.). 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Some  of  the  proposed  methods  are  in 
accordance  with  the  Ph  Eur.  Complete  method  validation  data  was  provided  for  the  non  compendial 
(in-house)  analytical  methods.  Appropriate  HPLC  methods  are  used  for  assay  and  related  substances 
and they have been appropriately validated. 
The assay analysis is performed by an HPLC method with UV detection at the maximum absorption of 
the defined pirfenidone peak. The method has been validated with regard to specificity, linearity, range, 
accuracy,  precision,  robustness,  system  suitability  and  stability  of  solutions.  All  chromatograms  were 
presented including standard, sample and stress chromatograms 
Related  substances  are  determined  by  an  HPLC  method  with  UV  detection.  The  results  for  known 
impurities  are  calculated  relative  to  the  response  of  the  impurities  reference  standards  and  unknown 
impurities are calculated to the response of pirfenidone reference standard peak.  
The method has been validated with regard to specificity, linearity, range, limit of quantification (LOQ), 
limit  of  detection  (LOD),  accuracy,  precision,  robustness,  system  suitability  and  stability  of  solutions. 
All  chromatograms  are  presented  including  standard,  sample  and  stress  chromatograms.  The  results 
indicate that impurities in pirfenidone can be determined accurately over the range evaluated.  
Particle size is measured by laser diffraction and it has been validated for repeatability and ruggedness 
to confirm its suitability.  
In general specification limits and analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the 
drug substance. 
Batch  analysis  results  for  pirfenidone  have  been  presented.  All  batches  were  manufactured  by  the 
proposed commercial manufacturer according to the process described in the ASMF. All batches show 
the same impurity profile. It can be concluded that the batch analysis results indicate that the process 
is under control. Active substance of a high purity is consistently produced. 
Stability 
Stability  studies  were  performed  according  to ICH requirements.  Sixty  months  long  term  stability  data 
(25°C  ±  2°C  /  60%RH  ±  5%)  and  6  months  accelerated  data  (40°C  ±  2°C  /  75%RH  ±  5%)  were 
presented for four batches. These batches were representative of the commercial drug substance. The 
stability  samples  were  packaged  in  a container  closure  system  which  mimicked  the  one  which  will  be 
used  for  the  commercial  drug  substance.  All  results  of  the  key  parameters  tested  show  no  or  a  very 
slight  change  vs.  the  initial  time  point  testing.  This  was  also  the  case  for  the  batches  stored  at 
accelerated  conditions.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  described 
process is very stable over a proposed re-test period. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 8/84
 
 
 
 
 
Forced  degradation  studies  have  also  been  performed  in  order  to  further  characterise  the  drug 
substance. In the solid state, no degradation products have been found under stress conditions such as 
acid, base, oxidation, heat or light. In the photostability study conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B 
guideline  conditions,  good  stability  of  pirfenidone  in  the  solid  state  when  exposed  to  light  was 
confirmed. Degradation has only been observed under light exposure of pirfenidone in solution. 
It  has  been  confirmed  that  the  first  three  production-scale  batches  will  be  tested  according  to  the 
protocol,  and  thereafter  one  batch  per  year  will  be  tested  for  stability.  In  accordance  with  EU  GMP 
guidelines1, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  aim  of  pharmaceutical  development  program  was  to  obtain  a  hard  gelatin  capsule  dosage  form 
that  would  deliver  a  daily  dose  of  2400  mg  in  a  3  divided  doses  (800  mg  per  dose).  To  facilitate 
swallowing, this 800 mg dose was subdivided into three fractions considering that idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis occurs generally in an older population who may have difficulty in swallowing large oral dosage 
forms.  Each  capsule  therefore  contains  266.66  mg  (267  mg)  pirfenidone,  giving  a  daily  dose  of 
2403 mg. Small (size 1) hard gelatin capsules have been chosen. 
The  formulation  and  general  manufacturing  process  for  the  capsules  has  been  consistent  throughout 
the clinical development programme and 267 mg capsules were used in a safety and pharmacokinetic 
phase 1 and phase 3 clinical trials. 
Standard  manufacturing  processes  have  been  developed.  The  proposed  final  dosage  form  is  an 
immediate  release  capsule.  Compatibility  with  excipients  was  evaluated  by  preparing  mixtures  of 
pirfenidone  with  proposed  excipients.  The  mixtures  were  stored  under  accelerated  conditions  and 
evaluated. The mixtures were also evaluated by x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) to monitor structural 
changes  of  pirfenidone.  Analysis  indicated  that  there  was  no  chemical  or  structural  incompatibility 
between  pirfenidone  and  the  tested  excipients.  Based  on  the  data  submitted  a  filler  (microcrystalline 
cellulose),  a  binder  (povidone),  a  disintegrant  (croscarmellose  sodium),  and  a  lubricant  (magnesium 
stearate) were considered appropriate and determined to be compatible with the drug substance. 
Various variations of the final formulation were investigated in order to achieve the desired dissolution 
profile.  Further  amendments  to  the  manufacturing  process  and  processing  were  made  in  order  to 
optimise the manufacturing process. 
The  in  vitro  dissolution  method  was  developed  to  monitor  consistency  of  drug  release.  The 
discriminatory power of the method has been appropriately demonstrated. 
Manufacturing  process  development  has  been  well  documented.  The  manufacturing  process  used  for 
the  clinical  trials  and  commercial  batches  has  not  substantially  changed.  It  has  been  shown  that  the 
manufacturing process is robust and it does influence the polymorphic form. Choice of the process was 
considered  justified  and  the  critical  process  parameters  and  process  equipment  are  generally 
satisfactorily identified.  
It  can  be  concluded  that  the  formulation  development  of  the  product  was  generally  described 
satisfactorily.  The  key  critical  parameters  were  identified  and  successfully  evaluated.  The  formulation

and  choice  and  optimisation  is  satisfactory.  The  proposed  dissolution  method  was  considered 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Among excipients used in the drug product only gelatin (component of the capsule shell) is of animal 
origin. For gelatin Ph Eur TSE Certificates of Suitability were provided.  
Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetable origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  described  as  well  as  a  process  flow  diagram  provided.  The 
process  comprises  a  standard  series  of  steps  followed  by  encapsulation.  Critical  steps  have  been 
identified and relate to the established in-process controls. The Applicant has set the ranges and target 
values for critical process parameters based on experience of manufacturing similar products, but more 
importantly  based  on  experimental  data  for  the  manufacture  of  a  range  of  batches  of  the  finished 
product.  
The Applicant has provided process parameters and batch data for two full scale batches as well as for 
two final blend and finished product testing pilot scale clinical and one pilot scale stability batches. The 
data  shows  consistent  manufacture  and  is  considered  sufficient  for  this  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
The utilised manufacturing process is considered standard and at the time of submission only process 
validation protocol was provided. This was considered acceptable. The protocol includes suitable tests 
to monitor the steps of the process and includes homogeneity testing of the. Formal full scale 
validation of the commercial process will be conducted in accordance with the agreed process 
validation protocol. 
Product specification 
The  drug  product  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (UV  and  HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage  units  (mass  variation),  dissolution  (with  UV  detection),  water  content  (Karl  Fisher),  assay 
(HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  microbiological  purity  (total  aerobic  microbiological  count,  total 
combined yeast and mould count, specified microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Staphylococcus  aureus,  Salmonella  spp.)  and  identity  tests  for  the  capsule  colourants:  iron  oxides, 
titanium dioxide, indigo carmine. 
The proposed specifications are in line with the ICH 6A and the Ph Eur monograph for capsules.  
Analytical methods have been sufficiently described, some of them are compendial methods described 
in the Ph Eur. Adequate validation data have been provided for non-compendial methods. 
Assay and related substances are determined by an HPLC method with UV detection. System suitability 
criteria were appropriately investigated and set in line with standard requirements. The procedure has 
been  validated  for  specificity,  limit  of  detection  (LOD),  limit  of  quantification  (LOQ),  linearity, 
accuracy/recovery,  precision,  range,  robustness  and  stability  of  solutions.  The  method  has  been 
demonstrated  to  be  capable  of  providing  accurate  results,  with  satisfactory  precision  over  an 
appropriate range for quantification of pirfenidone and related substances. 
Dissolution  is  determined  using  Ph  Eur  method.  Pirfenidone  content  is  measured  by  UV  using 
pirfenidone reference standard. The procedure for the determining dissolution rate has been validated

for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision and intermediate precision, range, stability and robustness. 
Effect  of  filtration  was  also  investigated  for  both  sample  and  standard  solution.  The  method  is 
adequately  described  and  it  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  capable  of  providing  accurate  results,  with 
satisfactory  precision  over  an  appropriate  range.  The  validation  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance 
with ICH.  
The Applicant has submitted batch analyses data all manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site.. 
Batch  analysis  results  demonstrated  compliance  with  the  proposed  specification  and  confirmed 
consistency and uniformity of the product. The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved 
that the product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  were  performed  on  3  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed  manufacturing  site  and 
packed in the container closure systems (bottles and blisters) proposed for the commercial product.  
Studies  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  current  ICH/CHMP  guidelines.  Stability  data  submitted 
covers  long-term  24  months  at  25°/60%,  30°/65%  and  30°/75%  RH  and  6  months  accelerated  at 
40°/75% RH for both packaging materials. 
Photostability testing was carried out on one batch. The capsules are not sensitive to light. 
Furthermore  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  monitor  the  primary  stability  batches  through  the 
proposed shelf-life. The first three commercial scale batches of the product packaged in HDPE bottles 
will  be  placed  on  long-term  stability  at  25°C/60%  RH  conditions  and  on  accelerated  stability  at 
40°C/75% RH in accordance with the agreed stability protocol. For the blister packaging a bracketing 
approach  was  proposed.  The  stability  blisters  will  be  placed  on  long-term  stability  at  25°C/60%  RH 
conditions  and  on  accelerated  stability  at  40°C/75%  RH  conditions.  In  addition,  one  batch  of  each 
packaging of the drug product will be placed annually on long-term stability study. 
The overall stability data showed that Esbriet is chemically, physically and microbiologically stable. The 
results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as 
defined in the SmPC. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

A  retest  period  was  supported  by  satisfactory  stability  studies  that  show  that  the  drug  substance  is 
stable, when in solid form. 
The  drug  product  is  an  immediate  release  hard  capsule  containing  267  mg  of  pirfenidone.  The 
composition  of  the  finished  product  has  been  described,  and  all  excipients  have  been  fully 
characterised. 
The development pharmaceutics has been satisfactorily described. The excipients are well established 
and used in acceptable quantities. Their function has been satisfactorily described. 
The formulation is considered satisfactorily justified. 
The  method  of  manufacture  is  considered  standard  and  has  been  satisfactorily  described,  including 
hold  times  and  in-process  tests.  The  scale  of  manufacture  is  supported  by  batch  data.  The  Applicant 
has  provided  process  parameters  and  batch  data  for  two  full  scale  batches  as  well  as  for  pilot  scale 
batches.  The  data  shows  consistent  manufacture  and  is  considered  sufficient  for  this  manufacturing 
process. A satisfactory validation protocol for three commercial scale batches has been provided. 
Specifications  are  provided  for  the  excipients,  which  include  appropriate  functional  tests,  where 
appropriate.  Compliance  with  current  TSE  requirements  is  satisfactory.  The  gelatin  excipient  is 
supported by EDQM TSE certificates of suitability. 
The scope of the finished product specification complies with ICH Q6A and the Ph Eur requirements for 
hard  capsules,  limits  comply  with  regulatory  requirements  and  are  in  line  with  batch  data.  The 
analytical  methods  and  validation  data  are  satisfactory.  The  batch  data  demonstrate  consistent 
manufacture.  
The  stability  programme  is  considered  satisfactory.  The  batches  placed  on  stability  are  considered 
representative  of  the  product  to  be  marketed.  The  results  generated  during  the  stability  studies 
support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  drug  substance  and  the  drug  product  have  been  appropriately  characterised  and  generally 
satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided.  The  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  and  the 
drug  product  can  be  reproducibly  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory 
and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  Applicant  has  conducted  non-clinical  programme  that  is  generally  acceptable  and  in  line with  the 
advice given by the CHMP.  
The pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were reported to be GLP-compliant. The main 
bioanalytical validation and toxicokinetic bioanalyses were also GLP-compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  actions  of  pirfenidone  are  suggested  to  relate  to  its  anti-fibrotic  and 
anti-inflammatory actions and were characterised in in vitro experiments and in vivo models.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 12/84
 
 
 
 
 
In  vitro,  pirfenidone  suppressed  the  proliferation  of  fibroblasts,  inhibited 
lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated  release  of  platelet-derived  growth  factor  AB  and  of  transforming  growth  factor 
(TGF-β1),  inhibited  collagen  synthesis  in  fibroblast  cultures  and  promoted  the  release  of  collagenase 
from fibroblasts over the concentration range 5.5 to 185 μg/mL. Concentration-dependent inhibition of 
the  release  of  LPS-induced  tissue  necrosis  factor-α  (TNF-α)  was  observed  with  respective  median 
(50%)  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  values  of  48.3  and  30 μg/mL  in  THP-1  (human  monocytic 
leukaemia  cells)  and  RAW264.7 cells  (mouse  peritoneal  macrophage  cell  line).  These  in  vitro  effects 
were seen at clinical concentrations or low multiples of clinical concentrations; a daily clinical dose of 
2403 mg resulted in a Cmax of 14.7 μg/mL and AUC0-24 of 180 µg·h/mL.   
In  vivo,  a  range  of  studies  was  conducted  in  models  of  fibrosis  in  mice,  rats,  hamsters  and  dogs.  
Relevant pharmacodynamic activity was found in: 
 
a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (investigating treatment and prophylaxis via 
oral administration) 
 
a mouse heterotropic tracheal allograft model (investigating prophylaxis via dietary 
administration)  
 
a  rat  model  of  bleomycin-induced  lung  fibrosis  (investigating  prophylaxis  via  dietary 
administration) 
 
 
a rat orthotopic left lung transplant model (investigating treatment via dietary administration) 
a  hamster  model  of  bleomycin-induced  lung  fibrosis  (investigating  prophylaxis  via  dietary 
administration) 
 
a canine model of congestive heart failure 
Primary  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  conducted  with  the  major  metabolite  in 
animal and human plasma, 5-CA pirfenidone, and 5-OH pirfenidone (present in mouse and rat plasma 
but  not  detectable  in  dog  or  human  plasma).  5-CA  pirfenidone  did  not  exhibit  any  pharmacological 
activity in vitro or in vivo. 5-OH pirfenidone was pharmacologically active in vivo and in vitro and was 
approximately 50% as active as pirfenidone.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pirfenidone  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory  effects  in  rat  models  of  induced  edema  and  adjuvant-
induced arthritis.  No effects on humoral or cellular immunity were observed in mice. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A comprehensive receptor and enzyme screening battery did not reveal any binding that was likely to 
have any appreciable effects at clinical exposures. 
Pirfenidone demonstrated minimal hERG inhibition (16%) at concentrations of 185 μg/mL, with an IC50 
of  925 μg/mL  (5000 µM)  and  had  no  effect  on  action  potentials  in  guinea  pig  ventricular  papillary 
muscle.  In  anaesthetised  rats,  decreased  blood  pressure  was  seen  at 30 mg/kg  and  increased  heart 
rate  at 100  and  300 mg/kg.  Premature  ventricular  contractions  occurred  continuously  in  2/6  rats  at 
300 mg/kg.  Similar  effects  were  seen  in  conscious  rats,  although  decreased  blood  pressure  was  only 
seen at 300 mg/kg, and AV block was observed in some animals at 100 and 300 mg/kg. Similar effects 
were not observed in dogs.   
No consistent effects on blood pressure or ECG were seen in dogs at 300 mg/kg. Although prolongation 
of  QT  and  QTc  intervals  was  seen  at  100 mg/kg,  apparent  shortening  of  QT  interval  was  seen  in  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 13/84
 
 
 
 
 
same  study  at  300 mg/kg;  there  was  also  an  increase  in  heart  rate.  A  single  oral  dose  of  100  or 
300 mg/kg gives C max values approximately 3 and 6.5 times the clinical Cmax. In a follow-up study in 
anaesthetised  dogs  dosed  by  the  intraduodenal  route,  no  effect  on  ECG  was  observed,  whilst  an 
increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure were seen at 100 and 300 mg/kg. Measured Cmax 
values at 100 and 300 mg/kg were approximately 7 and 14 times the clinical Cmax. 
No consistent effects on blood pressure or ECG were seen in dogs given intravenous (IV) pirfenidone.   
5-CA  pirfenidone  had  no  effects  on  hERG  channel  inhibition  or  action  potential  at  1000 µM 
(215 µg/mL).   
No  consistent  effects  on  the  respiratory  system  were  seen  following  single-dose  intraduodenal 
administration  up  to  300 mg/kg  in  anaesthetised  rats  apart  from  increased  respiratory  volume.  No 
consistent effects on the respiratory system were seen following single-dose oral (up to 300 mg/kg) or 
IV (5-minute bolus dose of 0.9, 3.1 or 6.1 mg/kg/5 min followed by 1-hour infusion with 8.8, 29.3 or 
58.7 mg/kg/h) administration in dogs.   
Transient  neurobehavioural  effects  including  sedation,  abnormal  posture,  abnormal  limb  position, 
staggering gait, ptosis and hypothermia were seen in mice given single oral doses of 30 to 300 mg/kg. 
At an oral  dose  of  300 mg/kg,  pirfenidone  caused  a  prolongation  of  pentobarbital-induced  sleeping 
time; the electro-shock and pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion thresholds were significantly higher.  
Decreased  gastric  emptying  and  decreased  small intestinal  transport  were  seen  in  rats  given  a  single 
oral dose of up to 300 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The  absence  of  studies  on  pharmacodynamic  interactions  was  justified  as  no  specific  potential 
interactions  were  identified  from  the  nonclinical  data  which  were  considered  relevant  for  further 
nonclinical investigation. The potential for relevant drug interactions was evaluated clinically.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  results  were  similar  for  unlabelled  material  from  PK  and  TK  studies  in  mice,  rats, 
guinea  pigs  and  dogs.  Pirfenidone  is  rapidly  absorbed  with  tmax  of  0.5  hour,  and  extensively 
metabolised  in  all  species  examined  with  terminal  elimination  half-life  ranging  between  1.6  to 
4.8 hours in mice, rats and dogs and similar to the half-life in humans. Bioavailability was high at 97% 
in rats and 79% in dogs. In mice and rats at 30 to 2000 mg/kg, pirfenidone showed an approximately 
dose-proportional increase in absorption. No meaningful changes in pharmacokinetic indices were seen 
with repeated dosing.   
Tissue  distribution  studies  provided  little  evidence  to  suggest  accumulation  of  pirfenidone  and  its 
metabolites in any tissues; adequate exposure was shown in the presumptive target organ, the lung.  
In mice, peak tissue radioactivity occurred within 5 minutes of dosing and well-perfused tissues, such 
as kidney>liver>lung, had the highest levels of radioactivity.   
Total radioactivity was widely distributed following oral administration to rats and was eliminated from 
the majority of tissues at a similar rate to that from plasma. The highest initial levels were seen in the 
pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands.  High levels were later seen in the kidney, probably reflecting its 
role  in.    In  pigmented  rats,  no  selective  distribution  or  retention  of  radioactivity  was  noted  in 
melanin-containing  tissues.  Overall,  there  was  no  selective  distribution  of  radioactivity  in  tissues 
recognised as potential targets for clinical adverse effects.

In vitro, protein binding at a concentration of 100 μg/mL approximated 30% in the mouse and the rat 
while  in  the  dog  and  human  it  approximated  50%.  In  the  human,  binding  was  predominantly  to 
albumin.  In humans in vivo, serum protein binding ranged from 54% to 62%.  It is unlikely that there 
will  be  any  clinically  significant  protein  binding-based  drug-drug  interactions.  Little  or  no  effect  of 
pirfenidone  on  the  P-gp  transporter  system  was  observed.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that  clinically 
relevant  drug-drug  interactions  will  occur.  In  rats,  approximately  11%  of  pirfenidone-associated 
material underwent entero-hepatic recirculation.   
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  [14C]-pirfenidone  to  rats  on  Gestation  Day  19,  the  maximum 
concentration  of  radioactivity  in  the  uterus  and  mammary  gland  (21  to  26 μg  Eq/g)  and  fetal 
organs/tissues  (16  to  21 μg  Eq/g)  was  seen  30  minutes  after  dosing.  Disappearance  of  radioactivity 
from fetal tissues and blood was rapid but the concentration ratios of radioactivity in the amniotic fluid 
relative  to  the  maternal  plasma  were  0.09,  0.38,  0.46  and  9.44  at  5  and  30 minutes  and  8  and 
24 hours  respectively.    The  9-fold  increase  at  24 hours  at  the  top  dose  indicates  the  potential  for 
accumulation  and  recirculation  in  the  fetus;  it  is  noted  however  that  material  in  the  amniotic  fluid  is 
likely  to  represent  metabolites  rather  than  the  parent  compound.  These  findings  are  adequately 
reflected in the SmPC.  
In  lactating  rats  given  [14C]-pirfenidone  orally  at  100 mg/kg  on  Postpartum  Day  12,  plasma 
radioactivity reached a peak concentration of 35.9 μg Eq/mL by 0.3 hours with an elimination half-life 
of  3.4 hours.  The  radioactivity  was  rapidly  transferred  into  the  milk  with  a  peak  concentration  of 
31.3 μg Eq/mL by 0.4 hours with an elimination half-life of 4.7 hours.  These findings are adequately 
reflected in the SmPC.   
The metabolism of pirfenidone was rapid in rats and dogs and was mediated predominantly by CYP1A2 
in humans. Clinical co-administration of fluvoxamine, a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, was associated with 
markedly increased pirfenidone exposure and its concomitant use is contraindicated in the SmPC.   
The metabolite profile of pirfenidone was qualitatively similar between laboratory species and humans 
with the major circulating metabolite being 5-CA pirfenidone. In rats and mice, the plasma levels of the 
5-CA  pirfenidone  metabolite  were  substantially  higher  than  that  of  the  parent  pirfenidone  while  the 
plasma  levels  of  5-CA  pirfenidone  approximated  50%  of  pirfenidone  levels  in  dogs  and  humans.  The 
elimination  of  pirfenidone  was  rapid  and  occurred  primarily  via  metabolism.  The  primary  route  of 
excretion  of  pirfenidone  was  via  the  urine  as  the  5-CA  pirfenidone  metabolite  and  appeared  to  be 
independent of the dosing route in rats and dogs.  Little or no parent compound was found in the urine 
of rats, dogs, mice and humans. About 5 to 10% in rats and about 10 to 15% in dogs were excreted 
faecally via biliary excretion. The faecal radioactivity was associated with 5-CA pirfenidone in rats and 
5-CA  pirfenidone  and  the  aglycon  of  3-O-glucuronide  in  dogs,  accounting  for  29%  and  25%  of 
radioactivity respectively.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Rats  and  dogs  were  shown  to  have  similar  metabolic  profiles  to  humans  and  were  thus  selected  as 
suitable species for toxicology studies. Pirfenidone has been studied in single-dose studies in mice, rats 
and  dogs,  in  repeat-dose  studies  in  mice  and  rats  by  the  dietary  route,  by  oral  gavage  and  by 
intravenous  infusion  in  rats  and  by  oral  capsule  in  dogs.  Carcinogenicity  studies  by  the  dietary  route 
were conducted in mice and rats. Reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits and 
a battery of genotoxicity studies has been performed. Because pirfenidone absorbs light in the visible 
CHMP assessment report

Page 15/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
range, phototoxicity and photogenotoxicity studies were also conducted with both pirfenidone and the 
5-CA metabolite.   
Single dose toxicity 
Eleven  single-dose  oral  toxicity  studies  were  conducted;  three  studies,  including  toxicokinetics,  were 
conducted  and  are  considered  pivotal:  a  mouse  study  (NCR001),  a  rat  study  (NCR140)  and  a  dog 
study (PCLN-PIRF-088).   
Hypoactivity,  prone  position  and  abnormal  gait  were  observed  in  mice  at  all  dose  levels,  with  lateral 
recumbency  and  dyspnoea  at  1000 mg/kg  and  above  with  4/4 males  and  3/4  females  dying  at 
2000 mg/kg  (NCR001).  At  2000 mg/kg,  the  Cmax  of  pirfenidone  was  554.6  (males)  and 
488.4 (females) µg/mL; the Cmax of 5-CA pirfenidone was 841.9 µg/mL in males. 
In  rats,  abnormal  gait,  reduced  activity, lateral  recumbency,  respiratory  depression  and pupil  dilation 
were observed at all dose levels, with reduced body temperature at 1000 mg/kg in fasted rats with 1/6 
males  and  3/6  females  dying  (NCR140).  Because  of  the  high  death  rate,  no  TK  indices  were 
determined  in  fasted  rats  given  1000 mg/kg.  In  fed  animals  at  1000 mg/kg,  the  C max  of  pirfenidone 
was  202.3  (males)  and  196.7  (females) µg/mL  and  the  AUC0-24h  was  600.6  (males)  and 
1042.1 (females) µg·h/mL.   
In  dogs,  emesis,  weakness  of  limbs,  decreased  activity  and  salivation  were  observed  at  both  dose 
levels  with  mydriasis,  vocalisation,  and  tremors  at  1000 mg/kg  (PCLN-PIRF-088).  There  were  no 
deaths  and  no  effects  on  body  weight,  food  consumption  or  urinalysis  attributable  to  pirfenidone. 
Transient  effects  on  haematology  and  serum  chemistry  were observed;  these  were  not  considered  to 
be  biologically  meaningful  in  that  the  findings  were  not  necessarily  seen  in  both  animals  at  a  given 
dose  level  or  were  not  dose-related.  A  decrease  in  thymus  weight  was  seen  in  both  animals  at 
1000 mg/kg which was accompanied by very slight cortical atrophy in the male only. At 1000 mg/kg, 
the  pirfenidone  C max  values  were  117.0  (male)  and  167.3  (female) µg/mL  and  the  AUC0-24h  values 
were 220.4 (male) and 509.7 (female) µg·h/mL.
Repeat dose toxicity 
The predominant observation in repeat-dose toxicology studies up to 6/9 months in duration included 
altered  posture,  hypoactivity,  altered  gait  and  sedation.  These  signs  coincided  with  plasma  tmax  and 
were mitigated by lowering C max such as through dosing via the diet or by dividing the daily dose. The 
most consistent target-organ effect seen across all species was increased liver weight. This increase in 
liver  weight  was  often  accompanied  by  hepatic  centrilobular  hypertrophy.  Except  for  a  3-  to  4-fold 
increase  in  alkaline  phosphatase  in  dogs,  there  were  no  remarkable  changes  in  markers  of  liver 
function or injury such as ALT, AST and bilirubin. Therefore, the hepatic effects appear not to represent 
specific  hepatotoxicity  caused  by  pirfenidone  but  rather  a  consequence  of  hepatic  metabolism  of 
pirfenidone  and  induction of  CYP  enzymes.  The  pattern  of  CYP  enzyme  induction  observed  in  rodents 
resembled that of phenobarbital.   
The  exposure  at  the  highest  doses  evaluated  in  chronic  toxicology  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were 
6 times and 12 times, respectively, the Cmax in IPF patients and 2 times and 4 times, respectively, the 
AUC.  In  repeat-dose  chronic  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  only  unchanged  pirfenidone  was 
analysed.  However,  based  on  metabolic  data  in  PK  studies  and  shorter-term  toxicology  studies,  the 
multiples  of  exposure  in  toxicology  species  for  the  5-CA  pirfenidone  metabolite  would  be  equal  to  or 
higher than the exposure to that metabolite in humans.  These margins have been calculated without 
taking account of plasma protein binding.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011

Given the difficulty in achieving sustained large exposure multiples in animals, because of the severity 
of  the  physical  signs,  a  study  in  rats  was  performed  using  continuous  IV  administration.  Similar 
adaptive  changes  to  those  seen  in  oral  studies,  but  no  other  anatomical  pathology  findings,  were 
associated  with  the  continuous  infusion  of  pirfenidone  to  SD  rats  at  doses  up  to  1625 mg/kg/day  for 
4 weeks. This dose resulted in the death of four females; one female at 1000 mg/kg also died.   
All the findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were found to be either wholly or partially reversible, 
and there was no evidence of delayed toxicity. The NOAELs in the 3- and 9-month studies in terms of 
systemic  toxicity  were  200 mg/kg/day  which  correlates  with  AUC0-24h  values  of  535.1/488.3  and 
660.6/479.1 µg·h/mL (male/female animals) in the 3- and 9-month studies, respectively. 
Genotoxicity 
The  potential  for  genotoxicity  has  been  evaluated  in  several  studies:  in  vitro  (Ames  tests  and 
chromosome  aberrations)  and  in  vivo  (micronucleus  test  in  mice  and  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis 
(UDS)  test  in  rats).  5-CA  pirfenidone  has  been  shown  to  be  present  in  in  vitro  studies  with  rat  liver 
microsomes  and  also  in  vivo  and  thus  has  also  been  implicitly  evaluated  in  these  studies.  All  these 
genetic toxicology studies were negative and neither pirfenidone nor the 5-CA metabolite is genotoxic.  
Carcinogenicity 
Oral  administration  of  pirfenidone  via  the  diet  to  B6C3F1  mice  at  doses  of  800,  2000  or 
5000 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks resulted in an increase in liver tumours. Similarly, oral administration 
of pirfenidone via the diet to F344 rats at doses of 375, 750 or 1500 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks resulted 
in  increases  in  liver  tumours  in  both  sexes  and  uterine  tumours  in  females.  The  pirfenidone-related 
liver tumours in rats and mice, and uterine tumours in rats, appear to be rodent- and species-specific 
and of questionable clinical relevance.   
In  hepatic  assays  in  rats  and  mice,  a  significant  induction  of  CYP  enzymes  was  observed  in  both 
species treated with pirfenidone. The hepatic CYP induction, pattern of isoenzymes induced, absence of 
mutagenicity/clastogenicity, and the nature of hepatic and thyroid pathological changes (rat) that are 
seen with pirfenidone are similar to those seen with phenobarbital. Phenobarbital is a prototype rodent 
hepatocarcinogen  that  induces  tumours  through  a  non-genotoxic  mechanism  involving  liver 
hyperplasia. Hepatic tumours produced by this mechanism in rodents are not considered to be relevant 
to  humans.  Mechanistic  studies  in  female  rats  showed  a  pirfenidone  treatment-related  increase  in 
extra-cellular  dopamine  in  the  hypothalamus.  In  this  respect,  pirfenidone  appears  to  behave  like 
dopamine agonists or dopamine releasers.   
In  another  study,  it  was  also  noted  that  there  was  a  trend  for  higher  oestradiol  levels  and  lower 
progesterone  and  prolactin  levels,  and  higher  oestradiol  to  progesterone  ratio  after  pirfenidone 
administration.  These  combined  results  indicate  that  the  uterine  tumours  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity 
study  are  probably  related  to  a  chronic  dopamine-mediated  sex  hormone  imbalance.  It  is  suggested 
that the prolactin-inhibiting action of dopamine may result in a high oestrogen/progesterone ratio that 
could  cause  uterine  neoplasms.  These  endocrine  mechanisms  believed  to  be  involved  in  the  rodents 
are not present in humans. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Two  combined  fertility  and  embryofetal  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats,  one  by  the  dietary 
route  and  the  second  by  oral  gavage.    An  embryofetal  toxicity  study  was  conducted  in  rabbits  and  a 
pre- and post-natal study in rats, both by oral gavage.

In  the  dietary  study,  significant  decreases  in  body  weight  and  food  consumption  were  observed  in 
males and females; in females, these correlated with depressed gravid uterine weights and fetal body 
weights.  These  findings  are  adequately  described  in  the  SmPC.  There  were  no  effects  on  fertility  and 
fetal  morphological  development  was  unaffected.  The  NOAEL  for  fertility  and  fetal  development  was 
concluded to 900 mg/kg/day.   
In  the  study  by  gavage,  females  receiving  450  or  1000 mg/kg/day  exhibited  a  dose-related 
prolongation  of  the  oestrous  cycle  and  a  high  incidence  of  irregular  cycles.  There  were  no  gross, 
skeletal or visceral variations, malformations or ossification changes attributable to pirfenidone. There 
was  no  evidence  of  any  adverse  effects  on  male  (including  sperm  counts  and  motility)  and  female 
fertility,  increased  embryolethality  or  teratogenicity  in  rats.  The  NOAELs  were  concluded  to  be 
50 mg/kg/day in males, and in pregnant rats and <50 mg/kg/day in females before mating for general 
toxicity,  and  150 mg/kg/day  for  reproductive  toxicity  in  females  and  1000 mg/kg/day  for  treated 
males and developmental toxicity.   
In  an  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rabbits,  lower  food  intake  was  noted  at  100  and 
300 mg/kg/day  with  lower  body  weight  gain  at  300  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  effects  on  fetal  or 
placental  weights  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  increased  embryolethality  or  of  teratogenicity:  the 
NOAEL  was  concluded  to  be  30 mg/kg/day  for  general  and  reproductive  toxicity  in  dams  and 
300 mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity in fetuses.  
In  a  pre-and  post-natal  study  in  rats,  deaths  occurred  in  F0  animals  at  1000 mg/kg/day  and  a 
statistically  significant  prolongation  of  gestation  period  was  noted  (22.7 days  versus  22.2  days  in 
control). Also at 1000 mg/kg, there was a reduction in the total numbers born and of live pups born.  
The  available  data  supports  the  conclusion  that  the  causative  factors  in  the  prolonged  gestation  and 
reduced  offspring  viability  are  likely  to  be  operating  in  the  peri-natal  period.  It  is  not  possible  to 
identify these factors, however, the possibility that direct fetotoxicity is involved cannot be discounted.  
Therefore, the SmPC advises that treatment should be avoided during pregnancy. Except for reduced 
body weights during the lactation period at doses ≥300 mg/kg/day, there were no changes in F1 pup 
survival,  physical  development  and  sexual  maturity  milestones,  behavioural  tests,  fertility  or  F2  litter 
size.   
Toxicokinetic data 
In  repeat-dose  oral  toxicology  studies  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  there  was  an  increase  in  systemic 
exposure to pirfenidone that was approximately dose-proportional. Levels of pirfenidone and the 5-CA 
pirfenidone  metabolite  measured  in  dietary  studies  in  mice  and  rats  showed  that  metabolite  levels 
were up to 2- to 7-fold higher than the parent pirfenidone levels. There was no evidence of a gender 
difference,  or  evidence  of  accumulation  of  pirfenidone  or  the  5-CA  pirfenidone  metabolite  after  daily 
repeat  dosing.  In  mice  and  rats,  oral  gavage  dosing  resulted  in  substantially  higher  Cmax  values  of 
pirfenidone compared with after dietary administration.   
Local tolerance  
No  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed  since  the  oral  route  is  the  intended  method  of 
administration in humans. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity 
Pirfenidone was not antigenic in guinea pigs and was not immunotoxic.

Phototoxicity 
There was no evidence of photosensitivity with pirfenidone but transient phototoxic effects were noted 
in  the  skin  of  guinea  pigs  and  these  were  mitigated  with  topical  application  of  sunscreen  agents.  No 
systemic  toxicity  was  noted  in  hairless  mice  with  concomitant  oral  administration  of  pirfenidone  and 
exposure  to  UVA/UVB  daily  for  1  month.  Reversible  local  toxicity  of  the  skin  characterised  as  mild 
acanthosis  and  mild  single-cell  necrosis  was  observed  in  the  epidermis  of  the  auricle  and  the  dorsal 
skin. The SmPC contains advice for the protection of the skin.   
5-CA-pirfenidone was negative in a bacterial test for photomutagenicity and for photoclastogenicity in 
Chinese  hamster  lung  cells.  Pirfenidone  was  negative  for  photomutagenicity  but  positive  for 
photoclastogenicity.  The  photoclastogenicity  assay  has  not  been  formally  validated  and  it  has  been 
argued  that  the  assay  lacks  specificity  and  might  not  be  relevant  for  predicting  the  risk  for  DNA 
damage. Thus, the clinical implication of the pirfenidone finding is unknown.  
Based  on  a  request  from  the  CHMP  to  further  discuss  the  potential  for  photoclastogenicity,  the 
applicant  provided  additional  data  including  data  from  an  assay  using  photodegraded  material 
(PCLN-PIRF-108)  confirming  that  the  photodegraded  material  was  not  clastogenic,  and  from  a 
comparison  of  photodegraded  material  with  pirfenidone  solution  exposed  to  UVA  as  for  the  original 
photoclastogenicity  study  (NCR303).  The  findings  support  that  the  photodegradation  products  of 
pirfenidone (solid and aqueous states) are unlikely to be a biologically significant factor in the observed 
photoclastogenicity of pirfenidone. It is also noted that the reported skin reactions seen in the clinical 
studies so far support the conclusion that the skin rashes seen are more likely to be a manifestation of 
phototoxicity than photoallergy. Overall, it is considered that the issue is adequately addressed in the 
SmPC and the Risk Management Plan.   
Impurities 
The specified impurities do not appear to represent any particular toxicological hazard, were present in 
the drug material used in all toxicity studies and thus were qualified as part of these studies.   
2.3.5.  Environmental risk assessment 
The worst case Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) for pirfenidone, assuming no degradation 
or  removal  in  sewage  treatment,  is  0.36 μg/L  and  the  PEC FRESHWATER  SEDIMENT,  0.323 μg/Kg.  The  worst 
case  PEC/PNEC  ratios  for  pirfenidone  to  surface  water,  groundwater,  micro-organisms  and  sediment 
organisms  (3  x  10-4,  1  x  10-5,  3.6  x  10-5  and  6.5  x  10-5)  are  all  well  below  the  respective  trigger 
values indicating that it does not present a risk in these compartments. The inclusion of the estimated 
level of excretion of pirfenidone in the calculation of PECSURFACE WATER and PEC FRESHWATER SEDIMENT further 
increases the safety margin for these compartments.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  general,  the  design  of  the  nonclinical  programme  is  acceptable  and  there  is  no  need  for  any 
additional studies. 
The  single-dose  studies  are  adequate.  In  fasted  animals,  the  toxic  effects  were  greater  than  in  fed 
animals. In rodents, signs of effects on the central nervous system, including hypoactivity, respiratory 
effects, abnormal gait and recumbency were noted. In dogs, emesis, salivation and vocalisation were 
recorded.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 19/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
The duration of repeat-dose studies is adequate to support this application.   
The  main  physical  signs  in  the  oral  subchronic  and  chronic  toxicology  studies  of  pirfenidone  were 
similar  to  those  seen  acutely  and  included  altered  posture,  hyopactivity,  altered  gait  and  sedation.  
These  could  be  mitigated  by  dividing  the  daily  dose  or  by  dietary  administration.  The  main  systemic 
effect  was  an  increase  in  liver  weight,  often  in  conjunction  with  hepatic  centrilobular  hypertrophy.  
There  was  no  increase  in  ALT,  AST  or  bilirubin,  suggesting  that  the  hepatic  effects  are  not  a 
manifestation  of  toxicity  but  are  the  result  of  enzyme  induction.    The  findings  were  all  wholly  or 
partially  reversible.  The  Applicant  has  conducted  supplementary  studies  to  investigate  this  question 
and the data support the proposed mechanism. There was no evidence of delayed toxicity.   
Because  the  doses  were  limited  by  the  physical  signs,  the  margins  of  exposure  to  pirfenidone  in 
animals  over  humans  are  not  very  large.  The  exposure  to  the  main  metabolite  was  around  unity  or 
slightly greater than the human exposure. An additional study with dosing by intravenous infusion was 
conducted to address this point. Although some deaths occurred, there were no additional findings or 
irreversible  toxicity  identified  in  the  infusion  study  compared  with  the  gavage  or  dietary  studies.  
Overall, there are no concerns over the degree of exposure in the toxicity studies.   
The findings in the carcinogenicity studies are compatible with the Applicant’s hypothesis that the liver 
tumours  found  were  related  to  enzyme  induction.  Pirfenidone  and  the  major  metabolite  were  not 
genotoxic and there was no early development of tumours compared with the controls. The arguments 
advanced in respect of the thyroid, uterine and Leydig cell tumours are also plausible and support the 
view that the tumours are not relevant to humans. The proposed mechanism is considered plausible.  
There were no effects on fertility in either gender but there was an effect on the oestrous cycle. There 
were also prolongation of gestation and a reduction in viability in the neonates in animals dosed in the 
peri-natal period. The effect on the oestrous cycle is consistent with the hormonal disturbances seen in 
the mechanistic studies.  It is possible that the prolongation of gestation is also mediated via hormonal 
disturbances, but other mechanisms might be involved in this effect and in the reduction in viability.   
Pirfenidone  was  shown  to  cause  phototoxicity  and  photoirritation  when  dosed  concomitantly  with 
exposure  to  UV  light.  In  hairless  mice,  there  was  no  systemic  toxicity  but  effects  on  the  skin  were 
noted. The proposed SmPC includes instructions for the protection of the skin.   
The impurities listed in the specification are considered to be adequately qualified.  
The  Applicant  has  conducted  an  acceptable  programme  of  work  to  investigate  the  potential  for 
ecotoxicity. It is concluded that pirfenidone will not constitute a risk to the environment.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  the  toxicity  studies,  pirfenidone  had  effects  on  the  central  nervous  system  that  precluded  the 
administration of high doses.  The main target organ was the liver, but the changes were considered to 
be  adaptive  and  there  was  no  irreversible  or  delayed  toxicity.  Tumours  were  found  in  the 
carcinogenicity  studies,  but  those  in  the  liver  were  deemed  to  result  from  the  adaptive  changes  and 
not indicative of a risk for humans. Hormonally-mediated mechanisms have been proposed for tumours 
in the uterus of rats and these are considered plausible; the findings are not considered to represent a 
risk to patients.   
Overall,  the  nonclinical  programme  is  appropriate  and  there  are  no  remaining  issues.  The  nonclinical 
findings are adequately reflected in the SmPC.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Overall,  pirfenidone  has  been  evaluated  and  characterised  in  1345  healthy  subjects  and  patients  at 
doses ranging from 801 mg/day to 4806 mg/day. Of these, 770 patients have received the proposed 
recommended  dose  of  2403  mg/day,  or  greater,  in  the  Applicant-sponsored  Phase  2  or  Phase  3 
studies. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. The Applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  pirfenidone  and  its  major  metabolite,  5-carboxy-pirfenidone  has  been 
evaluated in five Phase 1 (PIPF-005, PIPF-007, PIPF-008, PIPF-009, PIPF-010). It should be noted that 
non-clinical  studies  suggest  that  5-carboxy-pirfenidone  has  limited  biological  activity  and  no 
TNF-inhibitory effects have been identified at clinically relevant concentrations.

Absorption  
Pirfenidone  is  absorbed  slowly,  with  a  mean  peak  plasma  concentration  of  7.87  μg/mL,  occurring 
approximately  3–4  hours  after  ingestion  of  a  single  dose  of  801  mg  (PIPF-005).  The  slow  absorption 
rate maybe  one of the reasons for the increase in gastric irritancy as noted in the increase in gastric 
adverse events. 
Compared to the fasted state, administration after food slows the rate of absorption and reduces peak 
plasma  concentrations  of  pirfenidone.  Since  the  frequency  of  GI  AEs  appears  related  to  higher  Cmax 
values (PIPF-005) and GI or CNS AEs are less frequent when pirfenidone is administered with food, a 
recommendation that pirfenidone be taken with food is warranted. This effect does not appear to have 
an  impact  on  steady  state  serum  levels.  The  benefit  of  ingestion  with  food  is  the  reduction  in  GI 
side-effects. 
Distribution  
The  in  vitro  human  serum  protein  binding  of  [14C]-pirfenidone  was  investigated  at  concentrations  1, 
10, and 100 μg/mL (PCLN-PIRF-110). The in vitro serum protein binding of pirfenidone in humans was 
approximately 58% at a concentration of 10 μg/ml which approximates to the observed Cmax in healthy 
volunteers  and  patients  with  IPF.  The  amount  of  protein  binding  was  similar  over  the  concentration 
range  of  1-10  μg/mL  but  decreased  slightly  at  the  highest  concentration  tested,  100  μg/ml  (PCLN-
PIRF-110).  The  ex  vivo  serum  protein  binding  of  pirfenidone  was  also  investigated  at  1  and  3  hours 
after  oral  administration  of  600  mg  in  healthy  male  volunteers.  Serum  protein  binding  rates  ranged 
from 54% to 62%. 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  pooled  population  PK  analysis  (PIPF-ORD1),  the  mean  apparent  oral 
steady-state volume of distribution for pirfenidone is approximately 70 L indicating that distribution to 
tissues is modest. 
The CHMP noted that the dose of pirfenidone used in the ex vivo measurements is slightly lower than 
the  dose  recommended  for  treatment  of  IPF  but  is  sufficiently  close  to  represent  what  could  be 
expected with the slightly higher recommended dose. 
Metabolism 
Two  in  vitro  studies  to  characterise  the  enzymes  responsible  for  the  metabolism  of  pirfenidone  were 
conducted  using  human  liver  microsomes  (PCLN-PIRF-111  and  PCLN-PIRF-112).  A  third  study  was 
conducted using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and extrahepatic microsomes of the kidney and the 
small  intestine  of  humans  (PCLN-PIRF-114).  In  human  liver  microsomes  pirfenidone  was  primarily 
metabolised by CYP1A2 (approx. 48%) and multiple other CYPs (each <13%). There was a negligible 
contribution  to  the  metabolism  of  pirfenidone  by  microsomes  from  the  kidney  and  small  intestine.  In 
healthy human volunteers significant decreases and increases in pirfenidone clearance were observed 
secondary  to  concomitant  administration  of  CYP1A2  inhibitors  and  inducers  (PIPF-010),  respectively, 
which supports this as the primary route of metabolism. 
Elimination 
Following single-dose administration of pirfenidone in healthy older (50 to 66 years) adults, the mean 
apparent  terminal  elimination  half-life  was  2.4  hours  (PIPF-005).  Pirfenidone  is  predominantly 
(80-85%)  excreted  via  the  urine  with  95%  as  the  primary  metabolite,  5-carboxy-pirfenidone 
(PIPF-005). This is consistent with findings from mass balance studies in rats and dogs after oral or IV 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011

administration.  While  the  oral  clearance  of  pirfenidone  appears  modestly  saturable  this  does  not 
appear likely to be clinically relevant at the proposed therapeutic dose of 801 mg t.i.d.  
The  CHMP  stated  that  the  excretion  data  regarding  pirfenidone  clarifies  that  this  is  primarily  through 
one of the main metabolites 5-carboxy-pirfenidone. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-dependency was assessed by normalising all Cmax and trough concentrations to a dose of 100 mg 
linear 
and  applying  ANOVA;  no  significant  dose-dependency  was 
identified  suggesting 
pharmacokinetics up to a dose of 600 mg three times daily.  
Special populations 
The  pooled  population  PK  analysis  incorporated  an  evaluation  of  the  influence  of  a  range  of  subject 
demographic and disease characteristics on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. Differences in the PK 
of  pirfenidone  that  reached  statistical  significance  were  identified  for  age,  gender,  race  and  obesity 
although  the  magnitude  of  the  differences  was  small.  The  predicted  AUC  for  pirfenidone  was 
approximately  23%  higher  in  80  year  old  compared  to  50  year  old  patients.  In  females,  the  Cmax  of 
pirfenidone  was  approximately  10%  higher  than  in  males,  which  was  probably  related  to  a  smaller 
body size in the former. When analysed as an independent factor, the predicted AUC0-24 of pirfenidone 
was 21% lower in white compared with black subjects. Obese subjects had higher exposure than either 
normal or overweight subjects but the former were older and had worse renal function. 
The data submitted by the Applicant indicates that when taking pirfenidone patients who have mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment may have increased pirfenidone exposure and patients who have mild to 
moderate renal impairment may have increased metabolite exposure. In these cases where increased 
exposure is seen there is a higher risk of seeing the most frequent, dose dependant adverse events. In 
the case of hepatic impairment the rate of pirfenidone metabolisation is reduced which will lead to an 
increase  in  serum  levels.  The  SmPC  contains  an  appropriate  precaution  statement  also  particularly 
addressing  concomitant  use  of  CYP1A2  inhibitors,  a  contra-indication  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment or end stage liver disease, as well as information on monitoring of patients with moderate 
liver  disease.  In  the  case  of  renal  impairment  there  is  an  increase  in  5-carboxy-pirfenidone  serum 
levels. However, 5-carboxy-pirfenidone seems to have a low biological activity and is excreted well and 
should not cause any untoward effects in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. It does 
not  seem  to  have  any  effect  of  adverse  event  rates.  Therefore  the  contra-indication  in  the  SmPC 
regarding  severe  renal  impairment  or  end  stage  renal  disease  requiring  dialysis  is  considered  a 
sensible precaution. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Since the primary route of pirfenidone metabolism is via CYP1A2 the potential for inhibitors or inducers 
of this enzyme to affect its PK has been evaluated. Co-administration of fluvoxamine, a strong inhibitor 
of  this  enzyme  was  associated  with  markedly  increased  pirfenidone  exposure  with  a  statistically 
significant approximately six-fold increase in AUC0-∞ of pirfenidone and a doubling of C max (PIPF-010). 
While  fluvoxamine  is  a  strong  inhibitor  of  CYP  1A2,  it  also  inhibits  other  enzymes  involved  in 
pirfenidone metabolism e.g.CYP2C9 and 2C19. 
Based  on  in  vitro  studies,  the  potential  for  pirfenidone  to  be  impacted  by  inhibitors  of  other  CYP 
enzymes is unlikely. Cigarette smoking induces CYP1A2 and its effects on pirfenidone pharmacokinetics 
were  also  evaluated  in  this  study  (PIPF-010).  The  AUC0-∞  was  higher  in  non-smokers  than  smokers 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 25/84
 
 
 
 
 
(mean  46.7  versus  25.5  mg.h/L),  as  was  Cmax  (mean  8.82  versus  6.25  μg/mL),  while  clearance  was 
lower (mean 18.1 versus 41.3 L/h). 
By contrast, evaluation of potential PK interactions in a subset of patients enrolled in the Phase 3 study 
PIPF-004  revealed  no  significant  effect  of  inhibitors  or  inducers  of  CYP1A2  or  CYP3A4  (PIPF-ORD1). 
Despite this latter finding, pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients treated with inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP1A2. Given the magnitude of the effect observed specifically with fluvoxamine, it would 
be  appropriate  to  contra-indicate  its  concomitant  use  as  indicated  in  the  proposed  product  labelling. 
Special care should also be exercised if patients are treated with therapies that are inhibitors of both 
CYP1A2  and  other  CYP  isoenzymes  (e.g.  CYP2C9,  2C19,  and  2D6),  or  if  CYP1A2  inhibitors  are  being 
used concomitantly with inhibitors of other relevant enzymes such as CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6. Given 
the lower pirfenidone exposure seen in smokers, patients should be advised to stop smoking although 
this is likely to be routine advice for patients with IPF. 
There have been no clinical studies to evaluate the potential for pirfenidone to affect the metabolism of 
other drugs. However, in vitro studies to investigate the potential of pirfenidone to induce/inhibit drug 
metabolising  enzymes  have  been  conducted  in  human  hepatocytes  and  microsomes.  No  relevant 
inhibition or induction of drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP3A4/5, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 was observed at clinically relevant concentrations of 
pirfenidone.  There  was  also  little  effect  on  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  enzymes  A  and  B.  In  addition, 
no  effect  on  P-gp  mediated  digoxin  efflux  was  observed  in  vitro  with  Caco-2  cell  monolayers.  On  the 
basis  of  these  findings,  the  potential  for  pirfenidone  to  impact  the  PK  of  other  medicinal  products 
appears to be low. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Human  biomaterials  have  been  used  to  investigate  the  protein  binding,  metabolism,  and 
inhibition/induction potential of pirfenidone in several in vitro studies.  
Regarding  the  extent  of  serum  protein  binding  of  pirfenidone  the  overall  mean  protein  binding  was 
approximately  58%  at  1  and  10  μg/mL  but  decreased  slightly  to  approximately  50%  at  the  highest 
concentration tested, 100 μg/mL. Ex vivo serum protein binding rates ranged from 54% to 62%. 
Based  on  in  vitro  studies  sought  to  characterise  the  enzymes  responsible  for  the  metabolism  of 
pirfenidone the substance was found to be primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 (approximately 48%) with 
other CYPs contributing (each <13%). 
Four  studies  investigated  the  potential  for  pirfenidone  to  induce  or  inhibit  several  CYP  enzymes 
(CYP1A,  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C8/9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  CYP3A4,  CYP3A4/5).  The 
results of these studies indicated no appreciable induction and little or no inhibition of any of the CYP 
enzymes by pirfenidone or 5-CA pirfenidone.  
Little  or  no  effect  was  detected  regarding  the  inhibition  potential  of  pirfenidone  at  concentrations 
ranging from 10 to 1000  μM in vitro in human hepatocyte mitochondrial preparations for monoamine 
oxidase (MAO) enzymes A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B). 
The  potential  for  pirfenidone  to  be  a  substrate  of  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  mediated  transport  was 
concluded  to  be  unlikely  using  Caco-2  cell  monolayers  (human  adenocarcinoma  colonic  cell  line 
Caco-2)  at  concentrations  ranging  from  10  to  1000  μM.  The  potential  for  pirfenidone  to  inhibit  P-gp 
mediated digoxin efflux at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 μM was examined using Caco-2 cell 
monolayers.  The  IC 50  value  of  pirfenidone  for  P-gp  inhibition  was  determined  to  be  greater  than 
1000 μM.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest 
that  pirfenidone  exerts  both  antifibrotic  and  anti-inflammatory  properties  in  a  variety  of  in  vitro 
systems  and  animal  models.  In  cell-based  systems,  pirfenidone  has  been  shown  to  suppress  the 
proliferation of  fibroblasts;  attenuate  the  production  of  profibrotic  cytokines  including  platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) from human macrophage cell lines; 
inhibit  release  of  collagenase  from  fibroblasts;  and  reduce  the  accumulation  of  extracellular  matrix 
components, particularly collagen. Pirfenidone is also capable of reducing the synthesis and release of 
proinflammatory  cytokines,  including  tumor  necrosis  factor-alpha  (TNF-α)  and  interleukin-1–beta 
(IL-1β), and has been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to various 
stimuli. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study PCLN-PIRF-010 investigated the anti-fibrotic activity of pirfenidone on untreated and 
PDGF-stimulated proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts and found a statistically significant effect at 
all concentrations in untreated cultures and at 30 and 1000 μM in stimulated cultures. 
The  Applicant  has  conducted  a  single  study  to  measure  the  QTc  pharmacodynamic  potential  of 
pirfenidone  in  healthy  subjects  (PIPF-007).  The  results  indicate  that  the  placebo  and  positive  control 
arms  behaved  in  the  expected  manner;  neither  of  the  pirfenidone  arms  met  the  criterion  of  a 
prolongation of QTC of >10 ms and the study can be interpreted as indication that pirfenidone does not 
adversely influence the cardiac conduction system. The PK/PD interaction analysis is presented in the 
ECG analysis report and does not indicate a signal of a positive interaction. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has presented some in vitro modelling which could potentially explain the mode of action 
of pirfenidone as an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent. This in vitro data however has not been 
substantiated  with  in  vivo  pharmacodynamic  models  therefore  the  proposed  views  can  only  be 
hypothetical  and  must  be  viewed  as  such.  The  Applicant  has  conducted  a  QTc  prolongation  study  to 
investigate  if  pirfenidone  has  the  potential  to  alter  cardiac  electrophysiology.  The  study  results 
presented would indicate that pirfenidone is devoid of this pharmacodynamic activity. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pirfenidone  appears  to  have  anti-fibrotic  and  anti-inflammatory  properties  but  these  have  not  been 
clearly shown in man. Therefore the mode of action remains not fully established. Pirfenidone does not 
seem to alter cardiac conductance when used alone.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The  Applicant  has  not  conducted  formal  dose  response  studies.  The  Phase  III  Studies  SP3  and 
PIPF-004 investigated a lower and higher dose; the data as well as a discussion of the dose/response 
are included in the respective sections below. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Applicant has submitted two Phase III studies PIPF 004 and PIPF 006 which were regarded pivotal 
by  the  CHMP  and  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  Applicant  has 
also submitted a pooled analysis of these two studies due to the great similarity in design and aims of 
these two trials.

Study PIPF-004 A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, three-arm study 
of the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Methods 
This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary  fibrosis.  Patients  were  randomised  2:2:1  to  receive  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day,  placebo,  or 
pirfenidone  1197  mg/day,  respectively.  They  were  to  remain  in  blinded  study  treatment  from 
randomisation  until  approximately  72  weeks  after  the  last  patient  had  been  randomised.  The  study 
included  a  wash-out  period  (for  patients  to  discontinue  all  prohibited  medication  before  screening),  a 
screening  period,  a  study  treatment  period  and  a  final  follow-up  visit.  All  patients  were  required  to 
have a final follow-up visit 3 to 4 weeks after the treatment completion visit.

Study participants  
Eligible patients must have had a confident clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF without evidence 
or  suspicion  of  an  alternative  diagnosis  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  patients’  interstitial  lung 
disease, and they must have had evidence of IPF disease progression: 
  Clinical  symptoms  consistent  with  IPF,  including  insidious  onset  of  otherwise  unexplained 
dyspnoea on exertion of ≥ 3 months duration. 
  Diagnosis of IPF, defined as the first instance a patient was informed of having IPF, within 48 
months of randomisation. 
  Age 40 through 80 years, inclusive. 
  High  resolution  computed  tomography  (HRCT)  scan  showing  a  pattern  of  disease  consistent 
with a confident (definite) radiographic diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)/IPF. For 
patients  with  surgical  lung  biopsy  showing  definite  or  probable  UIP,  the  HRCT  criterion  of 
probable UIP/IPF was sufficient. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 29/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For  patients <50yrs  of  age:  open  or  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgical  (VATS) lung  biopsy 
showing definite or probable UIP within 48 months of randomisation. In addition, there were no 
features  that  supported  an  alternative  diagnosis  on  transbronchial  biopsy  or  bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL), if performed. 
 
For  patients  ≥50yrs  of  age:  at  least  one  of  the  following  diagnostic  findings,  as  well  as  the 
absence  of  any  features  on  specimens  resulting  from  these  procedures,  which  supported  an 
alternative diagnosis within 48 months of randomisation: 
o  Open or VATS lung biopsy that showed definite or probable UIP. 
o  Transbronchial biopsy that showed no features of an alternative diagnosis. 
o  BAL that showed no features of an alternative diagnosis. 
 
IPF disease severity and progression: 
o  Percentage  predicted  FVC≥50%  at  screening  and  Day  1  (before  randomisation).  The 
change in FVC between screening and Day 1 must have been ≤10% relative difference. 
o  Haemoglobin  (Hgb)-corrected  carbon  monoxide  diffusing  capacity/carbon  monoxide 
transfer (DLco)≥35% of predicted value at screening. 
o  Either FVC or Hgb-corrected DLco ≤90% of predicted value at screening. 
o  No  evidence  of  improvement  in  measures  of  IPF  disease  severity  over  the  year 
preceding study entry. 
o  Distance  walked  ≥150  meters  with  O2  saturation  ≥83%  on  ≤6L/minute  of  O2  during 
the 6-minute Walking Test (6MWT) oxygen titration procedure performed at screening.  
The  inclusion  criteria  presented  for  study  PIPF  004  cover  the  heterogeneity  of  this  condition.  Lung 
biopsy confirmation of IPF was sought before enrolling the patient in the study. This is in accordance 
with the current recommendations.

Sample size 
The original sample size was 325 patients to be randomised 2:2:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, 
placebo, or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day. 
During  the  study  enrolment  period,  based  on  emerging  data,  the  sponsor  decided  to  increase  the 
sample  size  and  extend  the  duration  of  treatment  to  provide  appropriate  powering  for  evaluating 
CHMP assessment report

primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures. These changes increased the power of the study to 
demonstrate statistically significant effects on the primary and secondary endpoint analyses.  
A  total  of  75  patients  were  added  to  the  previously  planned  325  patients  and  the  treatment  duration 
was increased by 12 weeks, from 60 to 72 weeks. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  remained  the  change  in  forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  but  was  now  to  be 
assessed at Week 72. The increased sample size and treatment duration provided approximately 97% 
power  to  detect  a  50%  reduction  in  the  rate  of  FVC  progression  after  72  weeks  of  treatment  with 
pirfenidone compared to placebo and also increased the power on the various secondary endpoints. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  2:2:1  to  receive  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day,  placebo,  or  pirfenidone 
1197 mg/day, respectively.  
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  study.  A  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC) 
was chartered to review unblinded safety and efficacy data at regular intervals during the trial and to 
evaluate the conduct and integrity of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  was  defined  to  include  all  randomised  patients  who  received  any 
amount of study treatment. This was the primary population for efficacy analysis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline to week 72 in percent predicted 
forced vital capacity (FVC). 
FVC was assessed at screening, day 1 (before randomisation), week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter 
until  the  end  of  the  study.  Patients  were  scheduled  to  remain  on  blinded  study  treatment  from 
randomisation until approximately 72 weeks after the last patient had been randomised into the study. 
At each visit at least three acceptable FVC measures were to be recorded.. Baseline percent predicted 
FVC  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  maximum  acceptable  measurements  obtained  at  screening  and 
Day  1.  The  week  72  percent  predicted  FVC  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  maximum  acceptable 
measurements  obtained  at  each  of  the  week  72A  and  72B  visits  (two  separate  days  on  the  week  72 
visit). 
Differences  between  the  treatment  groups  and  placebo  were  analysed  using  rank  analysis  of 
covariance  (the  Mantel-Haenszel  mean  score  chi-square  test)  stratified  by  geographic  region  (US  or 
ROW). Rank baseline percent predicted FVC value was included as a covariate. Data for patients who 
died  (imputed  as  percent  predicted  FVC  =  0%)  were  ranked  according  to  time  to  death,  with  the 
shortest time receiving the worst rank. 
To be included in the study, patients had to have a percent predicted FVC ≥ 50% at screening and day 
1  (before  randomisation).  The  change  in  FVC  between  screening  and  day  1  must  have  been  ≤  10% 
(relative difference).

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 2 Participant flow 
As  seen  above,  the  study  shows  an  increase  in  adverse  event  drop  outs  in  patients  using  the  higher 
dose of pirfenidone. Death rate was higher in the placebo group than in the treated groups. 
Recruitment 
Date of First Patient Visit: 14 July 2006; date Last Patient Completed Study: 07 November 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
The most important protocol amendment concerned the increase of the sample size and the extension 
of  the  duration  of  the  study  to  72  weeks  to  increase  the  power  and  broaden  the  clinical  experience. 
Additional changes to the study conduct based on protocol amendments are described.

There is a highly statistically significant difference seen between the 2403 mg/day group and placebo. 
The level of significance (p=0.0010) is of the level which would be acceptable for a single pivotal trial. 
It is more extreme than the p=0.00125 that is derived from two studies successful at p=0.05. 
In terms of mean changes there is a clear dose response. However the mean values could be a little 
misleading, as they can be skewed by the 0% scores being included for patients who died. Therefore 
looking  at  the  median  and  the  quartiles  is  also  important,  as  the  p-values  are  derived  from  a 
non-parametric method which can handle appropriately the 0% imputations. 
The median change at week 72 was -6.9 on the placebo group compared to -5.6 and -5.8 on the active 
groups. The 1197 mg/day group actually has the slightly better median (though two active groups are

very similar) but when looking at the quartiles the advantage for the higher dose is clear, as it has a 
much better 75th percentile.

Looking  at  the  changes  over  time,  the  difference  between  2403  mg/day  was  evident  from  the  first 
assessment (week 12) and achieved statistical significance by the second (week 24). The graph below 
plotting  the  median  changes  shows  clear  separation  from  placebo  for  both  groups,  but  both  active 
doses  seem  fairly  similar  to  each  other.  The  subsequent  graph  which  plots  the  upper  and  lower 
quartiles makes the difference between the active doses clearer. In the high dose group almost 25% of 
patients  experience  no  decline  from  baseline  by  week  72.  Overall  this  evidence  clearly  demonstrates 
the efficacy of pirfenidone in terms of % predicted FVC, and provides evidence that 2403 mg/day does 
better than 1197 mg/day.

Ancillary analyses 
In  PIPF-004  none  of  the  secondary  or  exploratory  parameters  were  statistically  significant  when 
compared  with  the  control  group.  There  were  favourable  trends  for  the  Sp02  (p=0.087)  and  A-a 
gradient (p= 0.065).

Study PIPF-006 A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, two-arm study of 
the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Methods 
This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with IPF. Patients were 
randomised 1:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo, and were to remain on blinded study 
treatment  from  randomisation  until  approximately  72  weeks  after  the  last  patient  had  been 
randomised in the study. The primary efficacy parameter was the absolute change in percent predicted 
forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  from  Baseline  to  Week  72.  The  study  included  a  Washout  Period  (for 
patients  to  discontinue  all  prohibited  medications  before  screening),  a  Screening  Period,  a  Study 
Treatment Period, and a Final Follow-up Visit. All patients were required to have a Final Follow-up Visit 
3 to 4 weeks after the Treatment Completion Visit.

Study participants  
Eligible patients must have had a confident clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF without evidence 
or  suspicion  of  an  alternative  diagnosis  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  patients’  interstitial  lung 
disease, and they must have had evidence of IPF disease progression, as follows:  
•  Clinical  symptoms  consistent  with  IPF,  including  insidious  onset  of  otherwise  unexplained  dyspnoea 
on exertion of on exertion, of ≥3 months duration 
• Diagnosis of IPF, defined as the first instance a patient was informed of having IPF, within 48 months 
of randomisation  
• Age 40 through 80 years, inclusive  
•  High-resolution  computed  tomography  (HRCT)  scan  showing  a  pattern  of  disease  consistent  with  a 
confident  (definite)  radiographic  diagnosis  of  usual  interstitial  pneumonia  (UIP)/IPF.  For  patients  with 
surgical  lung  biopsy  showing  definite  or  probable  UIP,  the  HRCT  criterion  of  probable  (UIP)/IPF  was 
sufficient.

•  For  patients  <50  years  of  age:  open  or  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgical  (VATS)  lung  biopsy 
showing  definite  or  probable  UIP  within  48  months  of  randomisation.  In  addition,  there  were  no 
features  that  supported  an  alternative  diagnosis  on  transbronchial  biopsy  or  bronchoalveolar  lavage 
(BAL), if performed.  
•  For  patients  ≥50  years  of  age:  open  or  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgical  (VATS)  lung  biopsy 
showing  definite  or  probable  UIP  findings,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  any  features  on  specimens 
resulting  from  these  procedures,  which  supported  an  alternative  diagnosis  within  48  months  of 
randomization:  
o  Open or VATS lung biopsy that showed definite or probable UIP  
o  Transbronchial biopsy that showed no features of an alternative diagnosis  
o  BAL that showed no features of an alternative diagnosis.  
• IPF disease severity and progression:  
o  Percent  predicted  FVC  ≥50%  at  screening  and  Day  1  (before  randomisation).  The  change  in 
FVC between screening and Day 1 must have been ≤10% relative difference. 
o  Haemoglobin  (Hgb)-corrected  carbon  monoxide  diffusing  capacity/carbon  monoxide  transfer 
capacity (DLCO) ≥35% of predicted value at screening only  
o  Either FVC or Hgb-corrected DLco ≤90%screening  
o  No evidence of improvement in measures of IPF disease severity over the year preceding study 
entry  
o  Distance walked ≥150 m (with O2 saturation ≥83% on ≤6L/minute of O2 during the 6-Minute 
Walk test (6MWT) oxygen titration procedure performed at screening.

The  Applicant  has  used  the  EMA/SAWP  endorsed  primary  endpoint  of  FVC.  An  extensive  list  of 
secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  has  been  presented  to  further  explore  and  substantiate  the 
potential benefits of pirfenidone. 
Sample size 
The original sample size was 260 patients to be randomised 1:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or 
placebo.  
During  the  study  enrolment  period,  based  on  emerging  data,  the  sponsor  decided  to  increase  the 
sample  size  and  extend  the  duration  of  treatment  to  provide  appropriate  powering  for  evaluating 
primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures. These changes increased the power of the study to 
demonstrate statistically significant effects on the primary and secondary endpoint analyses.  
A  total  of  60  patients  were  added  to  the  previously  planned  260  patients  and  the  treatment  duration 
was increased by 12 weeks, from 60 to 72 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint remained the change 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 42/84
 
 
 
 
 
in  forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  but  assessed  at  Week  72.  The  increased  sample  size  and  treatment 
duration provided approximately 97% power to detect a 50% reduction in the rate of FVC progression 
after 72 weeks of treatment with pirfenidone compared to placebo and also increased the power on the 
various secondary endpoints.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo.  
Blinding (masking) 
The blinding methods of Study PIPF-006 were the same as in Study PIPF-004.  
Statistical methods 
In trial PIPF-006 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo. The 
randomisation was stratified by region (US or ROW). The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined 
to include all randomised patients who received any amount of study treatment. This was the primary 
population for efficacy analysis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline to week 72 in percent predicted 
forced vital capacity (FVC). 
FVC was assessed at screening, day 1 (before randomisation), week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter 
until  the  end  of  the  study.  Patients  were  scheduled  to  remain  on  blinded  study  treatment  from 
randomisation until approximately 72 weeks after the last patient had been randomised into the study. 
At each visit at least three acceptable FVC measures were to be recorded.  Baseline percent predicted 
FVC  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  maximum  acceptable  measurements  obtained  at  screening  and 
Day  1.  The  week  72  percent  predicted  FVC  was  defined  as  the  mean  of  the  maximum  acceptable 
measurements  obtained  at  each  of  the  week  72A  and  72B  visits  (two  separate  days  on  the  week  72 
visit). 
Differences  between  the  treatment  groups  and  placebo  were  analysed  using  rank  analysis  of 
covariance  (the  Mantel-Haenszel  mean  score  chi-square  test)  stratified  by  geographic  region  (US  or 
ROW). Rank baseline percent predicted FVC value was included as a covariate. Data for patients who 
died  (imputed  as  percent  predicted  FVC  =  0%)  were  ranked  according  to  time  to  death,  with  the 
shortest time receiving the worst rank. 
To  be  included  in  the  studies  patients  had  to  have  a  percent  predicted  FVC  ≥  50%  at  screening  and 
day  1  (before  randomisation).  The  change  in  FVC  between  screening  and  day  1  must  have  been 
≤ 10% (relative difference).

Looking  at  the  pattern  over  time,  statistical  significance  was  achieved  at  the  first  assessment  (week 
12)  and  was  maintained  until  week  48.  At  all  time-points  the  trend  in  terms  of  the  median  and  both 
the lower and upper quartiles favoured active treatment.

Therefore, while this trial was negative in the sense that it failed on the primary endpoint (the week 72 
assessment)  it  does  provide  some  supportive  evidence  of  efficacy.  There  is  no  clear  explanation  for 
why efficacy is apparently diminishing at the final time-points in this trial, though the  decline in both 
active and placebo groups is smaller in this trial than in PIPF-004, maybe giving less room for showing 
a slowing in decline.

In  PIPF  006,  the  difference  between  the  pirfenidone  and  placebo  group  is  a  bit  smaller  than  in 
PIPF-004 and is statistically significant until week 48 after which it becomes non-significant.

Ancillary analyses 
All parameters studied did not show any statistical significance with the exception of the 6MWT which 
is presented here below. 
6MWT distance 
Table 13 Change from baseline to week 72 in 6MWT Distance (all randomised patients) 
At  Baseline,  the  6MWT  distance  was  378.0  meters  in  the  pirfenidone  2403-mg/day  group  and 
399.1 meters in the placebo group. At Week 72, there was strong evidence of a treatment effect in the 
mean  decline  in  6MWT  distance  in  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  compared  with 
patients  treated  with  placebo  (-45.1  vs.-76.9  meters,  respectively;  difference  of  31.8  meters; 
p <0.001).

The primary efficacy comparison in this study is between the pirfenidone 
2403-mg/day and placebo groups; the pirfenidone 1197-mg/day group was 
included for exploring a dose response relationship of pirfenidone in the 
treatment of patients with IPF. 
At Week 72, a treatment effect with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day compared 
with placebo was shown in the categorical assessment of percent predicted 
FVC and progression-free survival analysis. There was also a favourable 
trend for Sp02. None of the other secondary efficacy analyses (worsening of 
IPF, changes from Baseline in dyspnoea and percent predicted 
Hgb-corrected DLco) suggested a treatment effect with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day compared with placebo at Week 72.

None of the other secondary efficacy analyses (categorical change in FVC 
from baseline to week 72, progression-free survival, worsening of IPF, 
change from baseline in the worst SpO2, changes from Baseline in 
dyspnoea, percent predicted Hgb-corrected DLco and change from baseline 
in HRCT assessment) suggested a treatment effect with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day compared with placebo at Week 72. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A  combined  analysis  of  the  studies  PIPF-004  and  PIPF-006  was  provided.  The  primary  endpoint  was 
analysed using the same method as used in the individual trials, except that trial was added into the 
model as an additional term.

When the results from the two trials are combined the results achieve the extreme levels of statistical 
significance  that  would  be  hoped  for  from  a  meta-analysis.  This  level  of  evidence  is  achieved  at  all 
time-points. 
Though  the  second  trial  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  trends 
were  all  favourable  and  statistical  significance  was achieved  on  the  majority of  the  early  time-points. 
From  the  table  below  we  can  see  that  the  addition  of  PIPF-006  to  the  already  positive  PIPF-004 
generally  increases  the  evidence  of  efficacy,  though  it  is  slightly  weakened  for  the  final  two 
time-points.

measures.

Secondary endpoints 
The main secondary endpoints were time to death or disease progression and the 6 minute walk test. 
In  concordance  with  the  primary  analysis  the  result  in  PIPF-004  reached  statistical  significance  while 
only a trend was seen in PIPF-006. The combined analysis also achieved statistical significance. 
This  is  essentially  a  duplication  of  the  primary  analysis  as  the  dominating  event  was  disease 
progression  in  the  form  of  a ≥10%  decline  from  baseline in %  predicted  FVC.  The  other  definition  of 
progression  was  a  ≥15%  decline  in  DLco.  As  such  the  result  should  not  be  emphasised  in  the  SPC, 
especially is it may give the erroneous impression that some mortality benefit was shown.

For the six minute walk test the analysis method was the same as for the primary endpoint. A distance 
of  0  m  was  used  for  patients  who  died.  As  for  the  primary  endpoint  the  median  would  be  the  better 
statistic to summarise the differences, though the company has focused on means.

In the pooled analysis of survival in PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 the mortality rate with Esbriet 
2403 mg/day group was 7.8% compared with 9.8% with placebo (HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.47–1.28]). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Clinical studies in special populations were not conducted, which was considered acceptable. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Three studies have been considered as supportive data. These were two Japanese studies SP2 and SP3 
as well as PIPF 002. 
SP3  Phase  3  Clinical  Trial  of  Pirfenidone  in  Patients  with  Idiopathic  Pulmonary  Fibrosis 
Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Comparative Study  
The study was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative trial. The treatment groups 
consisted of a high dose (1800 mg/day), which served as the focus of the study, and a low-dose group 
(1200  mg/day),  which  was  designed  to  test  the  benefits  and  risks  of  a  reduced  dose.  For  both 
treatment  groups,  the  dosing  regimen  was  3  doses  per  day  after  every  meal.  The  dosing  period 
consisted of a dose escalation and 48 weeks of treatment for a total of 52 weeks.

The mean value (adjusted value) of the vital capacity (VC) variation was -0.09 in the high dose group 
and -0.16 in the placebo group and the variation in the high dose group was significantly higher than in 
the  placebo  group  (p=0.0416)  Based  on  this  it  was  concluded  that  the  higher  dose  of  pirfenidone 
inhibited  the  reduction  in  VC  more  effectively  than  placebo.  The  lower  dose  of  pirfenidone  was  also 
significantly  more  effective  than  placebo.  There  was  no  difference  between  the  high  and  low  dose  of 
pirfenidone used in this study. 
SP2 Phase II Study on Pirfenidone in Patients with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia 
This study was a parallel group comparison conducted under double-blind conditions as a multicentre 
study with randomised assignment of placebo controls. The dosage was gradually increased over seven 
days (gradual increase period), followed by continued administration for 48 weeks (treatment period). 
The objective was to examine the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with chronic idiopathic 
interstitial pneumonia using a placebo as the control drug.   
Results 
Primary  efficacy  results:  Analysis  of  covariance  of  the  SpO2  area,  which  is  the  principal  analysis 
indicator,  based  on  data  following  six-month  administration  to  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  subjects 
suggested  a  tendency  to  superiority  by  the  pirfenidone  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group 
(p=0.0880, final analysis results; p=0.0892). 
Secondary efficacy results: Analysis of the secondary evaluation variables on FAS subjects revealed a 
tendency  for  the  pirfenidone  group  to  be  superior  to  the  placebo  group  in  terms  of  variations  in  VC 
after six months of administration compared to the preadministration values (p=0.0995). A significant 
difference  was  found  at  the  nine-month  point  (p=0.0366).  The  pirfenidone  group  was  significantly 
superior to the placebo group in terms of VC and TLC in comparisons of the distribution in assessment 
of the degree of improvement of secondary evaluation variables based on data at the six-month point 
(p  values  of 0.0341  and  0.0302,  respectively). Similar  results were  obtained  at  the  nine-month  point 
(p  values  of  0.0028  and  0.0155,  respectively).  The  onset  of  acute  exacerbation  at  the  intermediate 
analysis  point  (after  six  months  of  administration)  revealed  absolutely  no  occurrences  in  the 
pirfenidone group (72 patients) but 5/35 cases in the placebo group. A significant difference was found 
in  the  incidence  rates  of  the  two  groups  (p=0.0031).  Subsequently,  by  completion  of  the  treatment 
period (including nine months of administration or more), acute exacerbation occurred in one member 
of the pirfenidone group and in five members of the placebo group. The pirfenidone group exhibited a 
tendency  to  superiority  over  the  placebo  group  in  assessment  of  the  degree  of  improvement  of 
high-resolution  CT  images  at  the  six-month  point  by  medical  specialists  based  on  image  assessment 
(final analysis results: p=0.0921).

PIPF  002  An  Open-Label,  Phase  2  Study  of  the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  Oral  Pirfenidone  in 
Patients with Pulmonary Fibrosis/Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  
Methods: the patients were enrolled in three groups: Group 1 patients were receiving oral pirfenidone 
or had received pirfenidone within 4 weeks before enrolment; Group 2 patients were initiating therapy 
with pirfenidone or reinitiating therapy after a lapse of greater than 4 weeks, and Group 3 patients who 
had  not  previously  received  pirfenidone  enrolled  via  the  EAP.  After  Amendment  2,  Group  2  patients 
also  enrolled  via  the  EAP.  [Note:    these  were  enrolment  groups  only;  data  were  not  analysed  by 
group.] 
Objectives:  The  objectives  of  this  study  of  pirfenidone  in  patients  with  pulmonary  fibrosis/idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (PF/IPF) were:  
– To assess the safety of treatment with pirfenidone (up to 3600 mg/day) in patients with PF/IPF  
– To assess the efficacy of treatment with pirfenidone (up to 3600 mg/day) in patients with PF/IPF  
- To provide PF/IPF patients with early access to pirfenidone 
Results: A total of 83 patients were enrolled across 27 sites and are included in the analyses for this 
interim  clinical  study  report.  The  study  group  consisted  primarily  of  white  males.  Median  age  was  70 
years  (range  47  to  88);  most  patients  (97.6%)  had  a  diagnosis  of  IPF  and  most  had  not  previously 
received pirfenidone (88%).   
Most patients (70) were enrolled through the EAP implemented with Amendment 2 (Group 3). A total 
of  13  patients  “rolled  over”  from  other  pirfenidone  trials  in  Groups  1  and  2.  Of  these,  10  patients  in 
Groups 1 and 2 had received pirfenidone in their original study; the other 3 patients had received an 
active control.  
As  of  the  interim  database  cut-off  of  30  April 2009,  50  patients  (60.2%)  had  prematurely  withdrawn 
from  the  study.  The  most  frequent  reasons  for  early  withdrawal  were  adverse  events  (17  patients, 
20.5%) and death (15 patients, 18.1%). 
Median percent predicted FVC was 65.6% at Baseline (N = 79), 66.8% at Week 48 (N = 57), 68.7% at 
Week  96  (N  =  47),  65.2%  at  Week  144  (N  =  35),  and  70.9%  at  Week  192  (N  =  11).  Median  Hgb-
corrected percent predicted DLco was 36.5% at Baseline (N = 73), 35.2% at Week 48 (N = 55), and 
38.3% at Week 96 (N = 44), 37.9% at Week 144 (N = 34), and 41.1% at Week 192 (N = 11). Median 
resting  oxygen  saturation  by  pulse  oximetry  on  room  air  was  95.0%  at  Baseline  (N  =  71),  Week  48 
(N =  47),  Week  96  (N  =  36),  and  Week  144  (N  =  30)  and  96.5%  at  Week  192  (N  =  8).  Of  the  41 
patients  who  were  not  receiving  supplemental  oxygen  at  start  of  study,  19  (46.3%)  started 
supplemental  oxygen  during  the  study.  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  time  to  first 
supplemental oxygen use was 151.7 weeks.  
As  of  the  30  April  2009  data  cut-off,  most  patients  had  not  experienced  a  protocol-defined  IPF 
exacerbation while enrolled in the study (63/83, 75.9%); 20 patients (24.1%) had an IPF exacerbation 
while  on  study.  Of  these  20  patients,  5  died  due  to  IPF,  3  discontinued  study  drug  due  to  AEs,  4 
discontinued due to non-AE-related reasons, and 8 remained on treatment as of 30 April 2009. A total 
of  15  patients  died  during  the  study  (18.1%);  14  deaths  (16.9%)  were  treatment  emergent;  and  12 
deaths (14.5%) were IPF related.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
IPF  is  a  heterogeneous  collection  of  idiopathic  disease  conditions  which  manifest  themselves  as 
pulmonary fibrosis. Once a patient is diagnosed with this condition it should be noted that death is the 
final outcome within 2 to 5 years.  
The ATS/ ERS Joint Statement published in 2000 offers some guidance regarding the measurement of 
therapeutic  effect.  In  this  Joint  Statement  there  is  a  Section  dedicated  to  "Length  of  Treatment"  and 
evaluation of therapeutic impact. The Guidance states:  
A  discernible  objective  response  to  therapy  may  not  be  evident  until  the  patient  has  received  >  3 
months  of  therapy.  Evaluation  should  be  conducted  at  6  months  and  12  months  to  determine  if 
therapy has a favourable, stabilising or a failure to respond to therapy. 
More  than  18  months  after  onset  of  therapy.  At  this  point,  therapy  should  be  individualised  on  the 
basis of the clinical response and tolerance of the patient to the therapy. The committee recommends 
that  the  therapy  be  continued  indefinitely  only  in  individuals  with  objective  evidence  of  continued 
improvement or stabilisation. 
The ATS/ERS Joint Statement also gives Guidance regarding how to measure therapeutic impact: 
A  favourable  (or  improved)  response  to  therapy  is  defined  by  two  or  more  of  the  following, 
documented on two consecutive visits over a 3- to 6-month period: 
  A  decrease  in  symptoms,  specifically  an  increase  in  the  level  of  exertion  required  before  the 
patient must stop because of breathlessness or a decline in the frequency or severity of cough 
  Reduction of parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiograph or HRCT scan 
 
Physiologic improvement defined by two or more of the following: 
  ≥10% increase in TLC or VC (or at least ≥200-ml change) 
  ≥15% increase in single-breath DLco (or at least ≥3 ml/min/mm Hg) 
  An improvement or normalization of O2 saturation (≥4 percentage point increase in the 
measured  saturation)  or  PaO2  (≥4-mm  Hg  increase  from  the  previous  measurement) 
achieved during a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test 
A  stable  (and  presumed  favourable)  response  to  therapy  is  defined  by  two  or  more  of  the  following, 
documented on two consecutive visits over a 3- to 6-mo period: 
  10% change in TLC or VC, or <200-ml change 
  <15% change in DLCO, or <3 ml/min/mm Hg 
  No change in O 2 saturation (<4% increase) or  PaO 2 (<4 mm Hg increase) achieved during a 
formal cardiopulmonary exercise test 
A failure to respond to therapy (e.g., after 6 mo of treatment) is defined as: 
  An increase in symptoms, especially dyspnoea or cough 
  An  increase  in  opacities  on  chest  radiograph  or  HRCT  scan,  especially  the  development  of 
honeycombing or signs of pulmonary hypertension 
  Evidence of deterioration in lung function in two or more of the following: 
  ≥10% decrease in TLC or VC (or ≥200-ml change) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 61/84
 
 
 
 
 
  ≥15% decrease in single-breath DLco (or at least ≥3-ml/min/mm Hg change) 
  Worsening  (greater  fall)  of  O2  saturation  (≥4  percentage  point  decrease  in  the 
measured saturation) or rise in the AaPO2 at rest or during a formal cardiopulmonary 
exercise test (≥4 mm Hg increase from the previous measurement) 
Percentage change in predicted FVC is a well recognised measure of disease progression or prognosis 
in  IPF.  The  literature  describes  this  measure  as  being  more  sensitive  than  many  of  the  others  that 
have been proposed such as DLco, SpO2 and AaGradient changes. HCRT is useful regarding identifying 
current status of pulmonary fibrosis but has not been shown to be sensitive enough to indicate disease 
progression. The 6MWT is the other parameter which has been recognised as sensitive in determining 
prognosis. 
Four double blind placebo controlled studies of the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in the treatment 
of  IPF  support  the  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA).  In  chronological  order  they  are  SP2 
(2000 to 2002) SP3 (2004 to 2006) both conducted in Japan; PIPF-004 and PIPF–006 (2006 to 2008) 
both conducted internationally. 
SP2  is  the  smallest  and  weakest  of  the  studies.  It  used  a  non-validated  primary  endpoint,  oxygen 
desaturation  during  a  treadmill  exercise  test  and  failed  to  distinguish  active  from  placebo  treatment. 
However, there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of decline of FVC and there was an 
important  difference  in  the  acute  exacerbation  rate  at  six  months  (which  is  not  stated).  By  nine 
months  14%  of  placebo  patients  and  none  of  the  pirfenidone  group  had  experienced  an  acute 
exacerbation. Data presentation in the CSR included in the MAA is very poor, in many sections it is so 
bad as to be uninterpretable. This is compounded by a poor translation; the linguistics may be correct 
but  the  translator  has  a  poor  grasp  of  the  technical  elements  of  the  study.  For  these  reasons  the 
published version (Azuma 2005) has also been used in this assessment report. 
SP3 is a considerably improved study compared to SP2 but still has significant shortcomings, the most 
significant  of  which  is  the  change  in  the  primary  endpoint  during  the  study.  As  with  SP2  the  initial 
primary  endpoint  was  oxygen  desaturation  during  exercise.  However,  during  the  study  the  DSMB 
recommended that it be altered to a pulmonary function endpoint change in VC. This recommendation 
appears  to  have  been  made  with  knowledge  of  the  accruing  comparative  data.  Overall,  the  study 
shows  a  statistically  significant  advantage  for  pirfenidone  treatment  in  terms  of  rate  of  decline  of  VC 
and in exacerbation free survival.  
PIPF-004 used lung function (FVC) as the primary variable and demonstrates a statistically significant, 
and clinically meaningful advantage in reduction of the rate of loss of lung volume and also in terms of 
a composite endpoint of death or disease progression. 
PIPF-006 was conducted to a similar design as PIPF-004 other than only one dose of pirfenidone was 
studied. The advantage for pirfenidone in terms of rate of loss of lung which was seen in the ‘central’ 
part of the study (weeks 24 to 48) had lost statistical significance and clinical relevance by study end. 
For the composite endpoint of death or disease progression there isn’t even a suggestion of a trend. 
Pirfenidone has been shown to have a modest but measurable effect on reducing the rate of decline in 
the  percentage  predicted  FVC  which  has  been  used  as  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  studies 
PIPF-004 and the pooled analysis of PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 at 72 weeks. PIPF-006 did not show any 
effect at 72 weeks In addition the PIPF-006 and the pooled analysis of PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 showed 
a significant increase in the walking distance in the 6MWT at 72 weeks. The mixed results obtained for 
the  primary  endpoint  and  the  6MWT  which  was  a  secondary  endpoint  remain  unexplained  by  the 
Applicant. Perhaps the change in both protocols from a 60 week treatment period to a 72 week period 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011

may  explain  in  part  what  occurred.  The  pooled  analysis  of  PIPF-004  and  PIPF-006  however  is 
acceptable from a statistical analysis point of view. This pooled analysis clearly showed that pirfenidone 
at  a  dose  of  2403  mg/day  was  effective  on  the  primary  endpoint  at  72  weeks  and  a  highly  relevant 
secondary end-point the 6MWT.  
If  the  ATS/ERS  joint  statement  is  considered  regarding  the  evaluation  of  clinical  effectiveness  of 
pirfenidone  at  6  and  12  months  it  could  be  deduced  that  this  product  has  a  stabilising  (presumed 
favourable effect) since the results comply with the parameters set in this document. 
The Japanese study SP3 supports these findings with a small but significant effect on VC at 52 weeks 
with  a  1800  mg/day  dose  of  pirfenidone.  The  exploratory  Japanese  SP2  study  showed  a  significant 
effect on VC which was a secondary parameter.  
Other  parameters  measured  did  not  show  any  significant  effect  at  either  dose  tested  of  pirfenidone. 
This lack of effect of efficacy on these other parameters is disappointing and supports the assumption 
that  the  effect  is  modest.  The  implications  for  morbidity  can  only  be  assumed  to  be  modest  and  the 
effects  on  mortality  hypothesised  if  one  bases  the  conclusions  on  the  survival  parameters  defined  in 
the exploratory analysis.  
IPF is a disease characterised by its remorseless progression and refractoriness to treatment; so much 
so  that,  on  an  individual  level,  if  a  patient  responds  to  treatment  the  diagnosis  warrants  careful  re-
evaluation. In these circumstances it is remarkable to have four studies showing a beneficial effect on 
the  rate  of  decline  of  pulmonary  function.  The  heterogeneity  of  the  results,  the  methodological 
imperfections,  the  statistical  shortcomings,  are  all  acknowledged,  but  all  the  data  point  in  the  same 
direction namely that pirfenidone has a beneficial effect on slowing the rate of loss of functional lung 
volume in IPF.   
A  consideration  in  evaluating  the  benefit  of  pirfenidone  is  that  it  is  not  curative;  patients  still  suffer 
from  a  fatal  disease;  therefore  their  quality  of  life  during  the  extension  offered  by  treatment  is  of 
major  importance.  Studies  SP2  and  SP3  utilised  patient-reported  outcome  instruments  to  assess 
symptoms  (principally  dyspnoea):    the  Chronic  Respiratory  Questionnaire  and  the  Hugh-Jones 
Classification.  However,  neither  study  incorporated  other  instruments  to  measure  classical  quality  of 
life.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Pirfenidone  has  a  modest  but  measurable  effect  on  FVC  and  the  6MWT.  It  can  be  assumed  that 
pirfenidone  at  a  dose  of  2403  mg/day  reduces  the  decline  in  FVC  normally  seen  in  patients  with  this 
condition. This would be the first time that a treatment would have shown some effect in reducing the 
rate  of  loss  in  pulmonary  function  in  IPF  as  has  been  measured  through  parameters  which  are 
recognised as sensitive in determining the prognosis of these patients.  
There is persuasive evidence that pirfenidone has a retarding effect on the rate of fibrosis in idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  database  for  pirfenidone  contained  in  this  application  is  derived  from  nine  controlled  and 
uncontrolled studies in patients with IPF plus the six clinical pharmacology studies.

Patient exposure 
The  Randomised  Patient  Subset  contains  only  patients  from  the  two  Phase  3  studies,  PIPF-004  and 
PIPF-006.  Patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  in  these  two  studies  are  included,  together  with  the  83 
pirfenidone-treated patients from PIPF-002, in the Pirfenidone Patient Subset (N = 515). 
The Expanded Pirfenidone Patient Subset contains pooled data from 789 unique patients  treated with 
pirfenidone  in  the  two  Phase  3  studies,  the  ongoing  uncontrolled  Phase  2  study  (PIPF-002)  and  the 
ongoing uncontrolled Phase 3 extension study (PIPF-012). 
In total, across all studies the total of pirfenidone-treated patients is 1103. An additional 242 subjects 
(healthy subjects or with hepatic or renal impairment) were exposed to pirfenidone in Phase 1 studies. 
The grand total of patients and subjects exposed to pirfenidone is 1345. 
Adverse events  
Results  in  this  analysis  of  AEs  concentrate  on  TEAEs  in  the  Randomised  Patient  Subset  and  the 
Pirfenidone Patient Subsets in the pooled safety analyses. In these studies, TEAEs were defined as AEs 
that  occurred  after  the  first  dose  and  within  28  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  treatment.  Patients 
who  discontinued  study  treatment  but  remained  on  study  were  followed  for  AEs  until  they  withdrew 
from study; patients who withdrew prematurely from study were followed for AEs for 28 days after last 
dose of study treatment.  
Common adverse events 
Common TEAEs are presented in the table below.

Anorexia 
Anorexia was reported by 37 (10.7%) patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, compared with 
13  (3.7%)  patients  treated  with  placebo  and  9  (10.3%)  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  1197 
mg/day.  Across  all  three  treatment  groups,  most  patients  had  a  single  event,  and  for  most  affected 
patients, the investigator considered anorexia to be related to study treatment. 
One  patient  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  experienced  Grade  3  anorexia.  No  patients 
experienced  Grade  4  anorexia.  Just  four  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  group  required 
medical treatment for anorexia. The dose of study treatment was modified in one patient each in the 
pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and 1197 mg/day groups and in no patients in the placebo group. 
Pirfenidone  1800  mg/day  and  placebo  rates  of  anorexia  were  32.9%  and  5.6%,  respectively,  in  SP2, 
and 16.5% and 2.8%, respectively, in study SP3. 
Decreased appetite 
Decreased  appetite  was  reported  by  30  (8.7%)  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day, 
10 (2.9%) patients treated with placebo, and 3 (3.4%) patients treated with pirfenidone 1197 mg/day. 
In the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group, older patients were slightly more likely than younger patients 
to report decreased appetite. In the three treatment groups, decreased appetite was mild or moderate, 
most  patients  had  a  single  event,  and  for  most  patients,  the  investigator  considered  decreased 
appetite to be related to study treatment. No patients discontinued study treatment for this event. The 
median  duration  of  decreased  appetite  was  longer  in  the  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  group  compared 
with the placebo group. 
Most  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  who  first  reported  decreased  appetite  did  so 
within the first 18 weeks of treatment. 
In  study  SP3,  decreased  appetite  was  recorded  for  9.2%  in  the  pirfenidone  1800  mg/day  group  and 
2.8% in the placebo group 
Photosensitivity Reactions 
A  photosensitivity  reaction  was  reported  by  42  (12.2%)  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day,  compared  with  6  (1.7%)  patients  treated  with  placebo  and  6  (6.9%)  patients  treated 
with pirfenidone 1197 mg/day. The majority of patients had a single event, most events resolved, and 
CHMP assessment report

for all affected patients, the investigator considered the photosensitivity reaction to be related to study 
treatment.  The  median  duration  of  the  photosensitivity  reaction  was  longer  in  the  pirfenidone  2403 
mg/day  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Nearly  half  of  the  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day 
group who reported photosensitivity reaction first did so between Weeks 0 and 18. 
Three patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and one patient treated with placebo experienced 
a  Grade  3  photosensitivity  reaction.  No  patients  experienced  a  Grade  4  photosensitivity  reaction.  No 
patients were hospitalized for a photosensitivity reaction.  
More  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  required  medical 
treatment  for  the  photosensitivity  reaction.  Approximately  half  of  the  patients  who  developed  a 
photosensitivity  reaction  were  treated  with  a  corticosteroid,  which  was  more  often  a  topical  than  a 
systemic  product.  The  dose  of  study  treatment  was  modified  for  a  photosensitivity  reaction  in  more 
patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day than with placebo. 
Slightly  more  male  than  female  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  reported  a 
photosensitivity reaction.

randomised patient subset 
The  intermediate  frequency  of  these  events  in  patients  receiving  pirfenidone  1197  mg/day  compared 
with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day further supports an association with pirfenidone. 
The  following  terms  related  to  skin  cancer  were  identified  within  the  SOC  of  Neoplasms  Benign, 
Malignant and Unspecified (including Cysts and Polyps) and the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders,  respectively:  basal  cell  carcinoma,  keratocanthoma,  malignant  melanoma,  melanocytic 
nevus, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell 
carcinoma  of  skin;  actinic  keratosis,  precancerous  skin  lesion,  skin  ulcer,  and  subcutaneous  nodule. 
The  percentages  of  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  and  placebo  groups  who  developed  these  TEAEs  are 
similar. 
Photosensitivity  reactions  and  rashes  represent  a  readily  manageable  tolerability  issue  that  is  not 
associated  with  significant  clinical  sequelae.  No  cases  of  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  erythema 
multiforme,  pemphigus,  or  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  have  been  reported  in  patients  receiving 
pirfenidone in the studies. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The  incidence  of  death  from  any  cause  was  7.6%,  the  adjusted  mortality  incidence  was  5.1,  and  the 
majority  of  deaths  (28/39)  were  related  to  IPF  in  the  Pirfenidone  Patient  Subset.  The  most  common 
causes of death were IPF (n = 13) and respiratory failure (n = 11).

Overall,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  experienced  SAEs  were  comparable  across  all  treatment 
groups and patient subsets (range 32.3% to 35.7%). The numbers of patients experiencing individual 
TE SAEs were small; however, no striking imbalances were noted.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Overall, the mean changes from Baseline to Week 72 in haematology parameters were similar across 
treatment groups. 
Serum Chemistry 
Overall,  the  mean  changes  from  Baseline  to  Week  72  in  serum  chemistry  parameters  were  similar 
across treatment groups with the exception of GGT and creatinine. The mean increase in GGT level for 
patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group was 7.6 U/L compared with 0.0 U/L for patients in the 
placebo group. The mean change for patients in the pirfenidone 1197 mg/day group was slightly less 
at  5.1  U/L.  In  patients  treated  with  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day,  the  mean  creatinine  level  decreased  -
5.6 μmol/L compared with -1.1 μmol/L in patients treated with placebo. The mean creatinine decrease 
in  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  1197  mg/day  group  was  -4.5  μmol/L.  Minimal  mean  changes  were 
observed in the three treatment groups in all other clinical chemistry parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Study  PIPF-011  was  performed  to  study  possible  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  issues  in  patients  with 
moderate hepatic insufficiency. It showed a 60% increase in exposure to pirfenidone. This is reflected 
in the SPC recommendation for close monitoring of such patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011

Study  PIPF-009  was  performed  to  study  possible  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  issues  in  patients  with 
mild to moderate renal insufficiency. No relationship between renal insufficiency and pirfenidone levels 
was  found.  However,  increased  exposure  to  the  metabolite  5-carboxy-pirfenidone  was  seen  with 
decreasing  creatinine  clearance.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  metabolite  does  not  seem  to  have  any 
significant biological action. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Effect of Antacid Co-administration 
The results of Study PIPF-005 indicated that co-administration of Mylanta Maximum Strength Liquid did 
not appear to substantially affect the PK of pirfenidone in either fed or fasted subjects. 
Concomitant CYP1A2 Inhibitors and Inducers 
Results  of  nonclinical,  in  vitro  experiments  indicate  that  pirfenidone  is  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP 
enzymes.  Of  the  portion  converted,  CYP1A2,  2C9,  and  2C19  accounted  for  65%  of  the  metabolism; 
combining  these  three  isozymes  with  CYP2D6  and  2E1  accounted  for  85%  of  the  low-level  oxidative 
metabolism (PCLN-PIRF-111). In a separate study (PCLN-PIRF-112), antibodies against CYP1A2 caused 
an  approximate  40%  inhibition  of  conversion  to  the  5-hydroxy  and  5-carboxy  metabolites.  Smaller 
extents of inhibition (<15%) were observed with antibodies against other CYPs. Therefore a multitude 
of CYP isozymes appear to play a role in pirfenidone metabolism, although the results shown and the 
modelling performed indicate that CYP1A2 is the most important. 
PIPF-010  was  designed  to  assess  the  effect  of  CYP1A2  inhibition  and/or  induction  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  pirfenidone  in  subjects.  The  co-administration  of  fluvoxamine  resulted  in  a 
significant drug interaction such that exposure (AUC 0-∞) to pirfenidone was, on average, nearly 6 times 
higher  after  10  days  of  dosing  with  fluvoxamine.  Subjects  also  experienced,  on  average,  a  2-fold 
increase  in  C max  after  administration  of  fluvoxamine.  The  AUC0-∞  of  5-carboxy  pirfenidone  was  not 
significantly  different  before  and  after  fluvoxamine  administration.  This  is  most  likely  due  to  the  fact 
that  the  5-carboxy  metabolite  is  cleared  predominantly  through  renal  mechanisms.  The  results  of 
PIPF-010  also  indicated  that  smoking  has  the  potential  to  induce  pirfenidone  metabolism  as  AUC0-∞ 
estimates were significantly lower in smokers as compared to non-smokers. Smoking did not have an 
effect on 5-carboxy pirfenidone clearance. 
Drugs  that  are  moderate-strong  inhibitors  of  both  CYP1A2  and  other  CYP  isozymes  (CYP2C9,  2C19, 
and  2D6)  should  not  be  used  in  combination  with  pirfenidone.  Despite  the  lack  of  apparent  drug 
interactions  with  co-administration  of  specific  CYP1A2  inhibitors  in  the  Phase  3  clinical  trial,  and  no 
evidence of a clinical pattern of AEs with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day being associated with concomitant 
use of CYP1A2 inhibitors, results of nonclinical studies suggest that strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be 
used  with  caution  in  patients  receiving  pirfenidone  due  to  the  potential  for  reduced  pirfenidone 
clearance. 
Concomitant  strong  CYP1A2  inducers  should  also  be  avoided  based  on  the  established  relationship 
between cigarette smoking, which causes CYP1A2 induction, and reduced pirfenidone PK exposure. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  a  clinical  pattern  of  TEAEs  with  pirfenidone  and  the  concomitant  use  of 
commonly used medications or prohibited IPF medications.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Relatively few patients overall discontinued treatment early due to AEs, particularly when considering 
the  length  of  these  studies  and  the  progressive  IPF  disease  state.  Only  6.2%  more  patients  in  the 
pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE 
(14.8% versus 8.6%, respectively). 
A  smaller  percentage  of  patients  in  the  pirfenidone  1197  mg/day  group  discontinued  treatment  early 
(10.3%)  compared  with  the  pirfenidone  2403  mg/day  patients.  Too  few  patients  discontinued  study 
treatment to draw meaningful conclusions about a pattern as to when patients were discontinuing due 
to the AE. 
IPF was the most common AE leading to discontinuation in all three treatment groups (range, 2.3% to 
2.9%). AEs leading to discontinuation by ≥2 patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and at a 
higher rate than the placebo or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day groups included nausea (1.4%), rash (1.4%), 
bladder  cancer  (0.9%),  respiratory  failure  (0.9%),  photosensitivity  reaction  (0.9%),  and  weight 
decreased (0.6%). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Pirfenidone does not appear to be associated with unexpected serious adverse events which could be 
considered to be life threatening. The death rate in the combined Phase III data sets indicates that the 
death  rate  for  the  2403  mg  dose  of  pirfenidone  was  lower  than  the  placebo  rate  at  72  weeks.  This 
would  correlate  with  the effects  on  FVC  that  have been  presented  in  the  pooled  analysis.  There  were 
no notable effects on cardiac QTc or other cardiac associated adverse events.  
Pirfenidone  is  however  associated  with  a  dose  response  effect  regarding  gastro-intestinal  side-effects 
notably nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia. There was an increase in anorexia and poor appetite 
but  this  was  not  consistently  dose  related.  There  was  a  dose  ranging  effect  regarding  phototoxicity 
which  presents  itself  as  a  rash  primarily  which  is  transient.  It  should  however  be  noted  that  the 
reporting incidence is closely associated with increased exposure to sunlight. The phototoxic potential 
of pirfenidone does not seem to associated with life threatening skin side-effects.  
Asthenia has been also reported more frequently in the pirfenidone group but this is not dose related.  
Pirfenidone  has  the  potential  for  drug  interactions  hepatically.  In  renally  impaired  patients  its 
metabolite  5-carboxy-pirfenidone  is  excreted  at  a  lower  rate  leading  to  an  increase  in  plasma 
concentrations. In addition it should be noted that hepatic metabolism produces two other metabolites. 
These aspects are adequately addressed in the SmPC and the Risk Management Plan. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Pirfenidone  is  associated  with  a  dose  effect  regarding  gastro-intestinal  and  phototoxicity  adverse 
events. There are no serious unexpected adverse events which report at a higher rate than those seen 
in placebo. The death rate is lower than that seen in placebo and this seems to be driven by an effect 
on IPF.  
The  phototoxicity  was  transient  (up  to  18months  following  initiation  of  therapy)  and  presented  itself 
often as a rash. The incidence of reporting increases in the summer months indicating that there is a 
relationship with increased exposure to solar light. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011

There  was  a  slight  increase  in  adverse  events  associated  with  connective  tissue  disorders  (2% 
2403 mg  pirfenidone  vs  1.2%  placebo).  This  is  a  very  small  difference  but  maybe  be  due  to  the 
proposed antifibrotic mode of action of this product. 
Discontinuation  of  therapy  due  to  adverse  events  was  higher  and  dose  related  when  compared  with 
placebo.  This  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  adverse  events  associated  with  respiratory, 
gastro-intestinal and skin system reporting areas.  
Pirfenidone  has  the  ability  to  interact  hepatically  with  other  drugs  and  its  plasma  levels  increase  in 
patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency.  In  renally  impaired  patients  the  plasma  concentrations  of  its 
minimally active metabolite 5-carboxy pirfenidone increase.  
The SmPC adequately describes the safety profile of pirfenidone based on the available data. Additional 
aspects  are  covered  by  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  This  includes  the  conduct  of  a  prospective 
observational registry to evaluate the long-term safety of pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF in a real-
world setting.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Pirfenidone has been shown to have some modest effect on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following 72 
weeks  therapy.  This  would  appear  to  affect  patient  outcome  by  reducing  mortality  rates  which  are 
primarily  linked  to  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Indeed  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  reported  death 
rate  in  the  pirfenidone  treated  patients  when  compared  to  the  control  group  in  the  integrated  safety 
summary.  
  Beneficial effects 
The  Applicant  has  presented  data  which  has  shown  potential  benefits  on  absolute  change  to  percent 
predicted  FVC  and  the  6MWT  after  72  weeks  in  patients  diagnosed  with  mild  to  moderate  idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis in a pooled analysis of two Phase III studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006.These findings 
were supported by two Japanese studies SP2 (Phase II) and SP3 (Pivotal Phase III). Measurable effects 
were  seen  with  1800  mg  and  2403  mg/day  of  pirfenidone.  The  data  would  support  the  concept  of  a 
dose  effect  with  the  maximal  effect  being  obtained  with  a  dose  of  2403  mg/day.  There  was  a  noted 
decrease in the reporting rate for mortality at 72 week in both Phase III studies when compared to the 
control  group  for  the  higher  dose  of  pirfenidone.  The  Applicant  indicates  that  this  is  associated  with 
deaths driven by causes associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The primary problem with this submission and the beneficial effects presented is that the PIPF-006 did 
not show a significant effect at 72 weeks for the absolute change in percent predicted FVC. This trial 
showed a positive effect until week 48 between the treated and active groups. This was lost at week 
60.  Inversely  the  6MWT  showed  a  favourable  trend  in  PIPF-004  in  favour  of  the  2403  mg  dose  of 
pirfenidone  at  week  72,  whereas  in  PIPF-006  this  parameter  was  highly  significantly  in  favour  of  the 
2403 mg/day treated pirfenidone group. The higher reduction in the mortality reporting rate is based 
on observational data and is derived from small numbers. To substantiate this claim a proper outcome 
study over a period of several years would be necessary. 
Risks 
Pirfenidone  has  not  been  associated  with  serious  life  threatening  adverse  events,  however  two  organ 
systems  the  gastro-intestinal  system  and  skin  system  are  primarily  affected  by  undesirable  adverse 
events associated with pirfenidone. There is an increase in the reporting rates for loss of appetite and 
loss of weight which are not dose related. Pirfendone has a potential for hepatic drug interactions. Its 
plasma  concentration  increases  in  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency.  In  patients  with  renal 
insufficiency the plasma concentrations of its metabolite 5-carboxy pirfenidone increase, however, the 
metabolite does not seem to be significantly active or affect adverse event rates. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/115147/2011   
Page 82/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pirfenidone  has  been  shown  to  have  phototoxicity  and  rash  where  the  reporting  rate  has  also  been 
shown  to  be  dose  related.  These  events  affecting  the  skin  progressively  disappear  after  18  weeks 
therapy.  In  man  pirfendione  is  metabolised  into  three  different  metabolites.  While  the  Applicant  has 
discussed some of the characteristics of 5-carboxy pirfenidone, little is known regarding the othertwo, 
although they do not seem to be produced in any detectable amounts in humans. Pirfenidone has been 
described  as  an  antifibrotic  agent,  which  would  suggest  that  it  could  affect  the  connective  repairing 
systems in other parts of the body. 
  Unfavourable effects 
The  gastro-intestinal  side-effects  are  associated  with  increases  in  nausea,  vomiting,  dyspepsia  and 
diarrhoea. These adverse events increase in rate with an increase in the dose of pirfenidone. Anorexia 
and  loss  of  weight  have  also  been  noted.  Skin  phototoxicity  and  rash  have  also  been  reported  in 
patients and the reporting rate increases with dose. Hepatic drug interactions have been demonstrated 
with  pirfenidone  and  its  plasma  concentrations  increase  in  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency.  The 
plasma concentrations of 5-carboxy pirfenidone increase in patients with renal insufficiency, however, 
the metabolite does not seem to be significantly active or affect adverse event rates. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Dosing  effects  have  been  noted  for  two  organ  system  adverse  events,  the  gastro-intestinal  and  skin 
systems.  The  mechanisms  by  which  pirfenidone  is  affecting  both  systems  are  unknown  and  could  be 
different. The use of pirfenidone has been only shown with fluvoxamine and in patients who smoke. It 
is not clear if there are other mechanisms by which pirfenidone is metabolised. 
Benefit-risk balance 
A modest but measureable therapeutic effect on FVC has been demonstrated in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis when high dose pirfenidone is used for 72 weeks. This was also seen for the 6MWT. 
No serious unexpected life threatening adverse events have been reported in the safety data set which 
is extensive and has measured the use of pirfenidone up to 144 weeks. A dose effect in the reporting 
rate  of  gastro-intestinal  and  skin  associated  adverse  events  has  been  recorded.  Pirfenidone  is 
associated  with  hepatic  drug  interactions  and  increased  plasma  levels  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment. Increased plasma levels of 5-carboxy pirfenidone are associated with renal impairment.  
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
An improvement seen in FVC over 72 weeks with the use of 2403 mg pirfenidone has been submitted. 
A similar effect was seen with the 6MWT. A decrease in the mortality reporting rate was also noted in 
those  treated  with  pirfenidone.  To  date  it  has  been  noted  that  no  current  therapeutic  algorithm  for 
idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  would  appear  to  produce  a  similar  improvement.  Gastro-intestinal  and 
skin  phototoxicity  adverse  events  have  not  been  shown  to  be  life  threatening  nor  have  has  the 
potential  for  drug  interactions  or  higher  doses  of  pirfenidone.  Plasma  concentrations  of  pirfenidone 
increase  in  hepatic  insufficiency  but  have  not  been  associated  with  life  threatening  adverse  events. 
Plasma  concentrations  of  5-carboxy  pirfenidone  increase  in  renally  impaired  patients  but  are  not 
associated with life threatening adverse events.

The benefit risk balance would appear to be favourable since the risks while present do not appear to 
put patients at serious risk and the benefits offer the potential for modest benefits in a condition which 
has to date responded poorly or not at all to current therapeutic algorithms. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit risk balance would appear to be favourable since the risks while present do not appear to 
put patients at serious risk and the benefits offer the potential for modest benefits in a condition which 
has to date responded poorly or not at all to current therapeutic algorithms. 
A  measureable  improvement  in  the  absolute  percent  predicted  change  in  FVC  presented  by  the 
Applicant  in  PIPF-004  and  PIPF-006  and  the  pooled  analysis  is  modest  but  meaningful.  While  studies 
SP2  and  SP3  may  have  methodological  concerns  a modest  signal  was  noted  for  parameters  measure 
VC.  This  would  support  the  findings  in  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies.  It  should  not  be  forgotten  that 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has a heterogeneous etiopathology making it a very difficult condition to 
study.  In  addition  the  6MWT  showed  a  favourable  trend  in  PIPF-004  at  72  weeks  and  was  highly 
significant in PIPF-006. The pooled analysis showed an overall significant effect. Death reporting rates 
were lower in the pirfenidone treated groups when compared to placebo. While it is very disappointing 
that  other  secondary  and  exploratory  parameters  did  not  show  trends  or  favourable  changes  which 
could  be  considered  as  a  consistent  signal  in  both  studies,  there  was  no  worsening  when  compared 
with placebo.  
The  dose  ranging  adverse  events  associated  with  the  gastro-intestinal  system  are  a  concern  as  are 
those  associated  with  skin  rash  and  phototoxicity.  Gastro-intestinal  adverse  events  will  affect 
compliance and the underlying cause should be explored further, however to date they do not appear 
to  be  life  threatening.  Similarly  the  skin  rashes  and  phototoxicity  are  of  concern  in  particular  the 
increase  in  their  reporting  rate  regarding  exposure  to  sunlight  and  the  association  with  dose.  Again 
they have not to date been shown to life threatening and appear to resolve after 18 weeks of therapy. 
No unexpected serious adverse events were reported by the Applicant. This strengthens support of the 
benefits of the product in this condition. 
The overall B/R of Esbriet is positive. The Applicant will conduct a prospective observational registry to 
evaluate the long-term safety of pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF in a real-world setting. 
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
The additional risk minimisation activities required are shown under section 3.7 
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Esbriet  in  the  treatment  of  Idiopathic  Pulmonary  Fibrosis  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

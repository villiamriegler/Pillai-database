proteinaceous particles. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression 
or surgery to bone) in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 5.1). 
Treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is 
unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
XGEVA should be administered under the responsibility of a healthcare professional. 
Posology 
Supplementation of at least 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily is required in all patients, 
unless hypercalcaemia is present (see section 4.4). 
Patients treated with XGEVA should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Prevention of skeletal related events in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone 
The recommended dose is 120 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks 
into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. 
Giant cell tumour of bone 
The recommended dose of XGEVA is 120 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once 
every 4 weeks into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm with additional 120 mg doses on days 8 and 15 of 
treatment of the first month of therapy.

Patients in the phase II study who underwent complete resection of giant cell tumour of bone did 
receive an additional 6 months of treatment following the surgery as per study protocol. 
Patients with giant cell tumour of bone should be evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether 
they continue to benefit from treatment. In patients whose disease is controlled by XGEVA, the effect 
of interruption or cessation of treatment has not been evaluated, however limited data in these patients 
does not indicate a rebound effect upon cessation of treatment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 for recommendations 
relating to monitoring of calcium, 4.8 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of denosumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly patients (age ≥ 65) 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of XGEVA have not been established in paediatric patients (age < 18) other 
than skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with giant cell tumour of bone. 
XGEVA is not recommended in paediatric patients (age < 18) other than skeletally mature adolescents 
(aged 12-17 years) with giant cell tumour of bone (see section 4.4). 
Treatment of skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is unresectable or 
where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity: the posology is the same as in adults. 
Inhibition of RANK/RANK ligand (RANKL) in animal studies has been coupled to inhibition of bone 
growth and lack of tooth eruption, and these changes were partially reversible upon cessation of 
RANKL inhibition (see section 5.3). 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
For instructions for use, handling and disposal see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe, untreated hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). 
Unhealed lesions from dental or oral surgery. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation 
Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is required in all patients unless hypercalcaemia is 
present (see section 4.2).

Hypocalcaemia 
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with XGEVA. 
Hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during therapy with XGEVA. Monitoring of calcium levels 
should be conducted (i) prior to the initial dose of XGEVA, (ii) within two weeks after the initial dose, 
(iii) if suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur (see section 4.8 for symptoms). Additional 
monitoring of calcium level should be considered during therapy in patients with risk factors for 
hypocalcaemia, or if otherwise indicated based on the clinical condition of the patient. 
Patients should be encouraged to report symptoms indicative of hypocalcaemia. If hypocalcaemia 
occurs while receiving XGEVA, additional calcium supplementation and additional monitoring may 
be necessary. 
In the post-marketing setting, severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including fatal cases) has been 
reported (see section 4.8), with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy, but can 
occur later. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis are at 
greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia. The risk of developing hypocalcaemia and accompanying 
elevations in parathyroid hormone increases with increasing degree of renal impairment. Regular 
monitoring of calcium levels is especially important in these patients. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
ONJ has been reported commonly in patients receiving XGEVA (see section 4.8). 
The start of treatment/new treatment course should be delayed in patients with unhealed open soft 
tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual 
benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with denosumab. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: 
• 
potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent 
compounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative 
dose of bone resorption therapy. 
cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to 
head and neck. 
poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, pre-existing dental disease, 
invasive dental procedures (e.g. tooth extractions). 
• 
• 
• 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with denosumab. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to XGEVA 
administration. 
The management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration 
between the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary 
interruption of XGEVA treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing 
risk factors are mitigated where possible.

Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with denosumab. Possible risk factors 
for osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk 
factors such as infection or trauma. The possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal 
should be considered in patients receiving denosumab who present with ear symptoms including 
chronic ear infections. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving denosumab (see section 4.8). 
Atypical femoral fractures may occur with little or no trauma in the subtrochanteric and diaphyseal 
regions of the femur. Specific radiographic findings characterise these events. Atypical femoral 
fractures have also been reported in patients with certain co-morbid conditions (e.g. vitamin D 
deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophosphatasia) and with use of certain pharmaceutical agents (e.g. 
bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors). These events have also occurred without 
antiresorptive therapy. Similar fractures reported in association with bisphosphonates are often 
bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in denosumab-treated patients who 
have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Discontinuation of XGEVA therapy in patients suspected to 
have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient based on an 
individual benefit-risk assessment. During denosumab treatment, patients should be advised to report 
new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Patients presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated 
for an incomplete femoral fracture. 
Hypercalcaemia following treatment discontinuation in patients with giant cell tumour of bone and in 
patients with growing skeletons 
Clinically significant hypercalcaemia requiring hospitalisation and complicated by acute renal injury 
has been reported in XGEVA-treated patients with giant cell tumour of bone weeks to months 
following treatment discontinuation. 
After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia, consider 
periodic assessment of serum calcium and re-evaluate the patient’s calcium and vitamin D 
supplementation requirements (see section 4.8). 
XGEVA is not recommended in patients with growing skeletons (see section 4.2). Clinically 
significant hypercalcaemia has also been reported in this patient group weeks to months following 
treatment discontinuation. 
Others 
Patients being treated with XGEVA should not be treated concomitantly with other denosumab 
containing medicinal products (for osteoporosis indications). 
Patients being treated with XGEVA should not be treated concomitantly with bisphosphonates. 
Malignancy in giant cell tumour of bone or progression to metastatic disease is an infrequent event and 
a known risk in patients with giant cell tumour of bone. Patients should be monitored for radiological 
signs of malignancy, new radiolucency or osteolysis. Available clinical data does not suggest an 
increased risk of malignancy in giant cell tumour of bone patients treated with XGEVA. 
Warnings for excipients 
This medicinal product contains sorbitol. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products 
containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into 
account.

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
In clinical trials, XGEVA has been administered in combination with standard anti-cancer treatment 
and in subjects previously receiving bisphosphonates. There were no clinically-relevant alterations in 
trough serum concentration and pharmacodynamics of denosumab (creatinine adjusted urinary 
N-telopeptide, uNTx/Cr) by concomitant chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy or by previous 
intravenous bisphosphonate exposure. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of denosumab in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
XGEVA is not recommended for use in pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential not 
using contraception. Women should be advised not to become pregnant during and for at least 
5 months after treatment with XGEVA. Any effects of XGEVA are likely to be greater during the 
second and third trimesters of pregnancy since monoclonal antibodies are transported across the 
placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the 
third trimester. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether denosumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Knockout mouse studies suggest absence of RANKL during pregnancy may interfere with 
maturation of the mammary gland leading to impaired lactation post-partum (see section 5.3). A 
decision must be made on whether to abstain from breast-feeding or to abstain from XGEVA therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the newborn/infant and the benefit of therapy for 
the woman. 
Fertility 
No data are available on the effect of denosumab on human fertility. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
XGEVA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Overall safety profile is consistent in all approved indications for XGEVA. 
Hypocalcaemia has very commonly been reported following XGEVA administration, mostly within 
the first 2 weeks. Hypocalcaemia can be severe and symptomatic (see section 4.8 - description of 
selected adverse reactions). The decreases in serum calcium were generally appropriately managed by 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The most common adverse reactions with XGEVA are 
musculoskeletal pain. Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (see sections 4.4 and section 4.8 - description 
of selected adverse reactions) have been commonly observed in patients taking XGEVA.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions based on 
incidence rates in four phase III, two phase II clinical studies and post-marketing experience (see 
table 1): very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data. Within each frequency grouping and system organ class, adverse reactions are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Hypocalcaemia 
A higher incidence of hypocalcaemia among subjects treated with denosumab compared to zoledronic 
acid has been observed in SRE prevention clinical trials. 
The highest incidence of hypocalcaemia was observed in a phase III trial in patients with multiple 
myeloma. Hypocalcaemia was reported in 16.9% of patients treated with XGEVA and 12.4% of 
patients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 3 decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 
1.4% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.6% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 4 
decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 0.4% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.1% 
of patients treated with zoledronic acid. 
In three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving 
bone, hypocalcaemia was reported in 9.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 5.0% of patients 
treated with zoledronic acid. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A grade 3 decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 2.5% of patients treated with XGEVA 
and 1.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 4 decrease in serum calcium levels was 
experienced in 0.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.2% of patients treated with zoledronic 
acid (see section 4.4). 
In two phase II single-arm clinical trials in patients with giant cell tumour of bone, hypocalcaemia was 
reported in 5.7% of patients. None of the adverse events was considered serious. 
In the post-marketing setting, severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including fatal cases) has been 
reported, with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy. Examples of clinical 
manifestations of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia have included QT interval prolongation, tetany, 
seizures and altered mental status (including coma) (see section 4.4). Symptoms of hypocalcaemia in 
clinical studies included paraesthesias or muscle stiffness, twitching, spasms and muscle cramps. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
In clinical trials, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure; ONJ has also been 
diagnosed after stopping treatment with XGEVA with the majority of cases occurring within 5 months 
after the last dose. Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or 
jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental 
procedure were excluded from the clinical trials. 
A higher incidence of ONJ among subjects treated with denosumab compared to zoledronic acid has 
been observed in SRE prevention clinical trials. The highest incidence of ONJ was observed in a 
phase III trial in patients with multiple myeloma. In the double-blind treatment phase of this trial, ONJ 
was confirmed in 5.9% of patients treated with XGEVA (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1 -
 52) and in 3.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. At the completion of the double-blind 
treatment phase of this trial, the patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ in the XGEVA 
group (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1 - 52), was 2.0 per 100 patient-years during the first 
year of treatment, 5.0 in the second year, and 4.5 thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 18.7 months 
(range: 1 - 44). 
In the primary treatment phases of three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with 
advanced malignancies involving bone, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients treated with XGEVA 
(median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1 – 40.5) and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. 
Clinical characteristics of these cases were similar between treatment groups. Among subjects with 
confirmed ONJ, most (81% in both treatment groups) had a history of tooth extraction, poor oral 
hygiene, and/or use of a dental appliance. Most subjects were receiving or had received chemotherapy. 
The trials in patients with breast or prostate cancer included an XGEVA extension treatment phase 
(median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1 – 67.2). ONJ was confirmed in 6.9% of patients 
with breast cancer and prostate cancer during the extension treatment phase. 
The patient-year adjusted overall incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1 per 100 patient-years during the 
first year of treatment, 3.7 in the second year and 4.6 thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 
20.6 months (range: 4 - 53). 
A non-randomised, retrospective, observational study in 2,877 patients with cancer treated with 
XGEVA or zoledronic acid in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway showed that 5-year incidence 
proportions of medically confirmed ONJ were 5.7% (95% CI: 4.4, 7.3; median follow up time of 
20 months [range 0.2-60]) in a cohort of patients receiving XGEVA and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.8, 2.3;  
median follow up time of 13 months [range 0.1-60]) in a separate cohort of patients receiving 
zoledronic acid. Five-year incidence proportion of ONJ in patients switching from zoledronic acid to 
XGEVA was 6.6% (95% CI: 4.2, 10.0; median follow up time of 13 months [range 0.2-60]). 
In a phase III trial in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which 
XGEVA is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1 per 100 patient-years during the first year of treatment, 3.0 in the 
second year, and 7.1 thereafter. 
In a long-term phase II open-label clinical trial in patients with giant cell tumour of bone (Study 6, see 
section 5.1), ONJ was confirmed in 6.8% of patients, including one adolescent (median number of 
34 doses; range 4 – 116). At the completion of the trial, median time on trial including safety follow-
up phase was 60.9 months (range: 0 – 112.6). The patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ 
was 1.5 per 100 patient-years overall (0.2 per 100 patient-years during the first year of treatment, 1.5 
in the second year, 1.8 in the third year, 2.1 in the fourth year, 1.4 in the fifth year, and 2.2 thereafter). 
The median time to ONJ was 41 months (range: 11 - 96). 
Drug related hypersensitivity reactions 
In the post-marketing setting, events of hypersensitivity, including rare events of anaphylactic 
reactions, have been reported in patients receiving XGEVA. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
In the clinical trial programme, atypical femoral fractures have been reported uncommonly in patients 
treated with XGEVA and the risk increased with longer duration of treatment. Events have occurred 
during treatment and up to 9 months after treatment was discontinued (see section 4.4). 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In the post-marketing setting, musculoskeletal pain, including severe cases, has been reported in 
patients receiving XGEVA. In clinical trials, musculoskeletal pain was very common in both the 
denosumab and zoledronic acid treatment groups. Musculoskeletal pain leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment was uncommon. 
New primary malignancy 
In the primary double blind treatment phases of four phase III active-controlled clinical trials in 
patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, new primary malignancy was reported in 
54/3691 (1.5%) of patients treated with XGEVA (median exposure of 13.8 months; range: 1.0–51.7) 
and 33/3688 (0.9%) of patients treated with zoledronic acid (median exposure of 12.9 months; range: 
1.0-50.8). 
The cumulative incidence at one year was 1.1 % for denosumab and 0.6 % for zoledronic acid, 
respectively. 
No treatment-related pattern in individual cancers or cancer groupings was apparent. 
Lichenoid drug eruptions 
Lichenoid drug eruptions (e.g. lichen planus-like reactions), have been reported in patients in the post-
marketing setting. 
Paediatric population 
XGEVA was studied in an open-label trial that enrolled 28 skeletally mature adolescents with giant 
cell tumour of bone. Based on these limited data, the adverse event profile appeared to be similar to 
adults. 
Clinically significant hypercalcaemia after treatment discontinuation has been reported in the 
post-marketing setting in paediatric patients (see section 4.4). 
Other special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a clinical study of patients without advanced cancer with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis, there was a greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia in 
the absence of calcium supplementation. The risk of developing hypocalcaemia during XGEVA 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment is greater with increasing degree of renal impairment. In a clinical study in patients without 
advanced cancer, 19% of patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) 
and 63% of patients receiving dialysis developed hypocalcaemia despite calcium supplementation. 
The overall incidence of clinically significant hypocalcaemia was 9%. 
Accompanying increases in parathyroid hormone have also been observed in patients receiving 
XGEVA with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis. Monitoring of calcium levels and 
adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is especially important in patients with renal impairment 
(see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose in clinical studies. XGEVA has been administered in clinical 
studies using doses up to 180 mg every 4 weeks and 120 mg weekly for 3 weeks.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases – other drugs affecting bone 
structure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX04 
Mechanism of action 
RANKL exists as a transmembrane or soluble protein. RANKL is essential for the formation, function 
and survival of osteoclasts, the sole cell type responsible for bone resorption. Increased osteoclast 
activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a key mediator of bone destruction in metastatic bone disease and 
multiple myeloma. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with 
high affinity and specificity to RANKL, preventing the RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring 
and resulting in reduced osteoclast numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and 
cancer-induced bone destruction. 
Giant cell tumours of bone are characterised by neoplastic stromal cells expressing RANK ligand and 
osteoclast-like giant cells expressing RANK. In patients with giant cell tumour of bone, denosumab 
binds to RANK ligand, significantly reducing or eliminating osteoclast-like giant cells. Consequently, 
osteolysis is reduced and proliferative tumour stroma is replaced with non-proliferative, differentiated, 
densely woven new bone. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In phase II clinical studies of patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, subcutaneous (SC) 
dosing of XGEVA administered either every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks resulted in a rapid 
reduction in markers of bone resorption (uNTx/Cr, serum CTx), with median reductions of 
approximately 80% for uNTx/Cr occurring within 1 week regardless of prior bisphosphonate therapy 
or baseline uNTx/Cr level. In phase III clinical trials of patients with advanced malignancies involving 
bone, median uNTx/Cr reductions of approximately 80% were maintained through 49 weeks of 
XGEVA treatment (120 mg every Q4W). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies, neutralising antibodies have not been observed for denosumab in advanced cancer 
patients or giant cell tumour of bone patients. Using a sensitive immunoassay < 1% of patients treated 
with denosumab for up to 3 years tested positive for non neutralising binding antibodies with no 
evidence of altered pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or clinical response. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours 
Efficacy and safety of 120 mg XGEVA SC every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid (dose-adjusted for 
reduced renal function) IV every 4 weeks were compared in three randomised, double-blind, 
active-controlled studies, in IV-bisphosphonate naïve patients with advanced malignancies involving 
bone: adults with breast cancer (study 1), other solid tumours or multiple myeloma (study 2), and 
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (study 3). Within these active-controlled clinical trials, safety was 
evaluated in 5,931 patients. Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active 
dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive 
dental procedure, were not eligible for inclusion in these studies. The primary and secondary endpoints 
evaluated the occurrence of one or more skeletal related events (SREs). In studies demonstrating 
superiority of XGEVA to zoledronic acid, patients were offered open-label XGEVA in a pre-specified 
2-year extension treatment phase. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture 
(vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to 
bone, or spinal cord compression. 
XGEVA reduced the risk of developing a SRE, and developing multiple SREs (first and subsequent) 
in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours (see table 2).

Disease progression and overall survival with bone metastases from solid tumours 
Disease progression was similar between XGEVA and zoledronic acid in all three studies and in the 
pre-specified analysis of all three studies combined. 
In studies 1, 2 and 3, overall survival was balanced between XGEVA and zoledronic acid in patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone: patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio and 95% CI was 
0.95 [0.81, 1.11]), patients with prostate cancer (hazard ratio and 95% CI was 1.03 [0.91, 1.17]), and 
patients with other solid tumours or multiple myeloma (hazard ratio and 95% CI was 0.95 [0.83, 
1.08]). A post-hoc analysis in study 2 (patients with other solid tumours or multiple myeloma) 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
examined overall survival for the 3 tumour types used for stratification (non-small cell lung cancer, 
multiple myeloma, and other). Overall survival was longer for XGEVA in non-small cell lung cancer 
(hazard ratio [95% CI] of 0.79 [0.65, 0.95]; n = 702) and longer for zoledronic acid in multiple 
myeloma (hazard ratio [95% CI] of 2.26 [1.13, 4.50]; n = 180) and similar between XGEVA and 
zoledronic acid in other tumour types (hazard ratio [95% CI] of 1.08 (0.90, 1.30); n = 894). This study 
did not control for prognostic factors and anti-neoplastic treatments. In a combined pre-specified 
analysis from studies 1, 2 and 3, overall survival was similar between XGEVA and zoledronic acid 
(hazard ratio and 95% CI 0.99 [0.91, 1.07]). 
Effect on pain 
The time to pain improvement (i.e. ≥ 2-point decrease from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score) was 
similar for denosumab and zoledronic acid in each study and the integrated analyses. In a post-hoc 
analysis of the combined dataset, the median time to worsening pain (> 4-point worst pain score) in 
patients with mild or no pain at baseline was delayed for XGEVA compared to zoledronic acid 
(198 versus 143 days) (p = 0.0002). 
Clinical efficacy in patients with multiple myeloma 
XGEVA was evaluated in an international, randomised (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled study 
comparing XGEVA with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, study 4. 
In this study, 1,718 multiple myeloma patients with at least one bone lesion were randomised to 
receive 120 mg XGEVA subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously 
(IV) every 4 weeks (dose-adjusted for renal function). The primary outcome measure was 
demonstration of non-inferiority of time to first on study skeletal related event (SRE) as compared to 
zoledronic acid. Secondary outcome measures included superiority of time to first SRE, superiority of 
time to first and subsequent SRE, and overall survival. An SRE was defined as any of the following: 
pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of 
radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. 
Across both study arms, 54.5% of patients intended to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation, 
95.8% patients utilised/planned to utilise a novel anti-myeloma agent (novel therapies include 
bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide) in first-line therapy, and 60.7% of patients had a previous 
SRE. The number of patients across both study arms with ISS stage I, stage II, and stage III at 
diagnosis were 32.4%, 38.2%, and 29.3%, respectively. 
The median number of doses administered was 16 for XGEVA and 15 for zoledronic acid. 
Efficacy results from study 4 are presented in figure 2 and table 3.

Clinical efficacy and safety in adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone 
The safety and efficacy of XGEVA was studied in two phase II open-label, single-arm trials (studies 5 
and 6) that enrolled 554 patients with giant cell tumour of bone that was either unresectable or for 
which surgery would be associated with severe morbidity. Patients received 120 mg XGEVA 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks with a loading dose of 120 mg on days 8 and 15. Patients who 
discontinued XGEVA then entered the safety follow-up phase for a minimum of 60 months. 
Retreatment with XGEVA while in safety follow-up was allowed for subjects who initially 
demonstrated a response to XGEVA (e.g. in the case of recurrent disease). 
Study 5 enrolled 37 adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or recurrent giant cell 
tumour of bone. The main outcome measure of the trial was response rate, defined as either at least 
90% elimination of giant cells relative to baseline (or complete elimination of giant cells in cases 
where giant cells represent < 5% of tumour cells), or a lack of progression of the target lesion by 
radiographic measurements in cases where histopathology was not available. Of the 35 patients 
included in the efficacy analysis, 85.7% (95% CI: 69.7, 95.2) had a treatment response to XGEVA. All 
20 patients (100%) with histology assessments met response criteria. Of the remaining 15 patients, 10 
(67%) radiographic measurements showed no progression of the target lesion. 
Study 6 enrolled 535 adult or skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone. Of these 
patients, 28 were aged 12-17 years. Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts: cohort 1 included 
patients with surgically unsalvageable disease (e.g. sacral, spinal, or multiple lesions, including 
pulmonary metastases); cohort 2 included patients with surgically salvageable disease whose planned 
surgery was associated with severe morbidity (e.g. joint resection, limb amputation, or 
hemipelvectomy); cohort 3 included patients previously participating in study 5 and rolled over into 
this study. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety profile of denosumab in subjects with 
giant cell tumour of bone. The secondary outcome measures of the study included time to disease 
progression (based on investigator assessment) for cohort 1 and proportion of patients without any 
surgery at month 6 for cohort 2. 
In cohort 1 at the final analysis, 28 of the 260 treated patients (10.8%) had disease progression. In 
cohort 2, 219 of the 238 (92.0%; 95% CI: 87.8%, 95.1%) evaluable patients treated with XGEVA had 
not undergone surgery by month 6. Of the 239 subjects in cohort 2 with baseline target lesion location 
or on-study location not in lungs or soft tissue, a total of 82 subjects (34.3%) were able to avoid on-
study surgery. Overall, efficacy results in skeletally mature adolescents were similar to those observed 
in adults. 
Effect on pain 
In the final analysis cohorts 1 and 2 combined, a clinically meaningful reduction in worst pain 
(i.e. ≥ 2-point decrease from baseline) was reported for 30.8% of patients at risk (i.e. those who had a 
worst pain score of ≥ 2 at baseline) within 1 week of treatment, and ≥ 50% at week 5. These pain 
improvements were maintained at all subsequent evaluations. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
XGEVA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of skeletal related events in 
patients with bone metastases and subsets of the paediatric population below the age of 12 in the 
treatment of giant cell tumour of bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
In study 6, XGEVA has been evaluated in a subset of 28 adolescent patients (aged 13-17 years) with 
giant cell tumour of bone who had reached skeletal maturity defined by at least 1 mature long bone 
(e.g. closed epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus) and body weight ≥ 45 kg. One adolescent subject 
with surgically unsalvageable disease (N=14) had disease recurrence during initial treatment. Thirteen 
of the 14 subjects with surgically salvageable disease whose planned surgery was associated with 
severe morbidity had not undergone surgery by month 6.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration, bioavailability was 62%. 
Biotransformation 
Denosumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as native immunoglobulin and is 
unlikely to be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are 
expected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides 
and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
In subjects with advanced cancer, who received multiple doses of 120 mg every 4 weeks an 
approximate 2-fold accumulation in serum denosumab concentrations was observed and steady-state 
was achieved by 6 months, consistent with time-independent pharmacokinetics. In subjects with 
multiple myeloma who received 120 mg every 4 weeks, median trough levels varied by less than 8% 
between months 6 and 12. In subjects with giant cell tumour of bone who received 120 mg every 
4 weeks with a loading dose on days 8 and 15, steady-state levels were achieved within the first month 
of treatment. Between weeks 9 and 49, median trough levels varied by less than 9%. In subjects who 
discontinued 120 mg every 4 weeks, the mean half-life was 28 days (range 14 to 55 days). 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not indicate clinically significant changes in the systemic 
exposure of denosumab at steady-state with respect to age (18 to 87 years), race/ethnicity (Blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians and Caucasians explored), gender or solid tumour types or patients with multiple 
myeloma. Increasing body weight was associated with decreases in systemic exposure, and vice versa. 
The alterations were not considered clinically-relevant, since pharmacodynamic effects based on bone 
turnover markers were consistent across a wide range of body weight. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Denosumab displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics with dose over a wide dose range, but 
approximately dose-proportional increases in exposure for doses of 60 mg (or 1 mg/kg) and higher. 
The non-linearity is likely due to a saturable target-mediated elimination pathway of importance at low 
concentrations. 
Renal impairment 
In studies of denosumab (60 mg, n = 55 and 120 mg, n = 32) in patients without advanced cancer but 
with varying degrees of renal function, including patients on dialysis, the degree of renal impairment 
had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab; thus dose adjustment for renal impairment is not 
required. There is no need for renal monitoring with XGEVA dosing. 
Hepatic impairment 
No specific study in patients with hepatic impairment was performed. In general, monoclonal 
antibodies are not eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. The pharmacokinetics of denosumab 
is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. 
Elderly 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between geriatric patients and younger 
patients. Controlled clinical studies of XGEVA in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over age 65 revealed similar efficacy and safety in older and younger patients. No dose adjustment is 
required in elderly patients. 
Paediatric population 
In skeletally-mature adolescents (12-17 years of age) with giant cell tumour of bone who received 
120 mg every 4 weeks with a loading dose on days 8 and 15, the pharmacokinetics of denosumab were 
similar to those observed in adult subjects with GCTB. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Since the biological activity of denosumab in animals is specific to nonhuman primates, evaluation of 
genetically engineered (knockout) mice or use of other biological inhibitors of the RANK/RANKL 
pathway, such as OPG-Fc and RANK-Fc, were used to evaluate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
denosumab in rodent models. 
In mouse bone metastasis models of oestrogen receptor positive and negative human breast cancer, 
prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, OPG-Fc reduced osteolytic, osteoblastic, and 
osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions, delayed formation of de novo bone metastases, and reduced skeletal 
tumour growth. When OPG-Fc was combined with hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) or chemotherapy 
(docetaxel) in these models, there was additive inhibition of skeletal tumour growth in breast, and 
prostate or lung cancer respectively. In a mouse model of mammary tumour induction, RANK-Fc 
reduced hormone-induced proliferation in mammary epithelium and delayed tumour formation. 
Standard tests to investigate the genotoxicity potential of denosumab have not been evaluated, since 
such tests are not relevant for this molecule. However, due to its character it is unlikely that 
denosumab has any potential for genotoxicity. 
The carcinogenic potential of denosumab has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. 
In single and repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, denosumab doses resulting in 2.7 
to 15 times greater systemic exposure than the recommended human dose had no impact on 
cardiovascular physiology, male or female fertility, or produced specific target organ toxicity. 
In a study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab during the period equivalent to the first 
trimester of pregnancy, denosumab doses resulting in 9 times greater systemic exposure than the 
recommended human dose did not induce maternal toxicity or foetal harm during a period equivalent 
to the first trimester, although foetal lymph nodes were not examined. 
In another study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab throughout pregnancy at systemic 
exposures 12-fold higher than the human dose, there were increased stillbirths and postnatal mortality; 
abnormal bone growth resulting in reduced bone strength, reduced haematopoiesis, and tooth 
malalignment; absence of peripheral lymph nodes; and decreased neonatal growth. A no observed 
adverse effect level for reproductive effects was not established. Following a 6 month period after 
birth, bone related changes showed recovery and there was no effect on tooth eruption. However, the 
effects on lymph nodes and tooth malalignment persisted, and minimal to moderate mineralisation in 
multiple tissues was seen in one animal (relation to treatment uncertain). There was no evidence of 
maternal harm prior to labour; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labour. Maternal 
mammary gland development was normal. 
In preclinical bone quality studies in monkeys on long-term denosumab treatment, decreases in bone 
turnover were associated with improvement in bone strength and normal bone histology. 
In male mice genetically engineered to express huRANKL (knock-in mice), which were subjected to a 
transcortical fracture, denosumab delayed the removal of cartilage and remodelling of the fracture 
callus compared to control, but biomechanical strength was not adversely affected. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In preclinical studies knockout mice lacking RANK or RANKL had an absence of lactation due to 
inhibition of mammary gland maturation (lobulo-alveolar gland development during pregnancy) and 
exhibited impairment of lymph node formation. Neonatal RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited 
decreased body weight, reduced bone growth, altered growth plates and lack of tooth eruption. 
Reduced bone growth, altered growth plates and impaired tooth eruption were also seen in studies of 
neonatal rats administered RANKL inhibitors, and these changes were partially reversible when 
dosing of RANKL inhibitor was discontinued. Adolescent primates dosed with denosumab at 2.7 and 
15 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) the clinical exposure had abnormal growth plates. Therefore, 
treatment with denosumab may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates and may 
inhibit eruption of dentition.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What XGEVA is and what it is used for 
XGEVA contains denosumab, a protein (monoclonal antibody) that works to slow down bone 
destruction caused by cancer spreading to the bone (bone metastasis) or by giant cell tumour of bone. 
XGEVA is used in adults with advanced cancer to prevent serious complications caused by bone 
metastasis (e.g. fracture, pressure on the spinal cord or the need to receive radiation therapy or 
surgery). 
XGEVA is also used to treat giant cell tumour of bone, which cannot be treated by surgery or where 
surgery is not the best option, in adults and adolescents whose bones have stopped growing. 
2.  What you need to know before you use XGEVA 
Do not use XGEVA 
- 
if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Your healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have a very low level of 
calcium in your blood which has not been treated. 
Your healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have unhealed wounds from 
dental or oral surgery. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using XGEVA. 
Calcium and vitamin D supplementation 
You should take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with XGEVA unless your 
blood calcium is high. Your doctor will discuss this with you. If the level of calcium in your blood is 
low, your doctor may decide to give you calcium supplements before you start treatment with 
XGEVA. 
Low calcium levels in the blood 
Please tell your doctor immediately if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or 
numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of 
consciousness while being treated with XGEVA. You may have low levels of calcium in your blood. 
Renal impairment 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed 
dialysis, which may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium, especially if you do not take 
calcium supplements. 
Problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported commonly 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients receiving XGEVA injections for cancer-related 
conditions. Osteonecrosis of the jaw can also occur after stopping treatment. 
It is important to try to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw developing as it may be a painful condition 
that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there 
are some precautions you should take: 
• 
Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (healthcare professional) if you have any 
problems with your mouth or teeth. Your doctor should delay the start of your treatment if you 
have unhealed wounds in your mouth from dental procedures or oral surgery. Your doctor may 
recommend a dental examination before you start treatment with XGEVA. 
•  While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental 
• 
• 
check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. 
If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform 
your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with 
XGEVA. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth 
or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could 
be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, taking steroids or anti-angiogenic medicines 
(used to treat cancer), undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, have gum 
disease or who are smokers, may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Unusual thigh bone fractures 
Some people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with XGEVA. 
Contact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. 
High calcium levels in the blood after stopping treatment with XGEVA 
Some patients with giant cell tumour of the bone have developed high calcium levels in the blood 
weeks to months after stopping treatment. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of 
high levels of calcium, after you stop receiving XGEVA. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
XGEVA is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age except for 
adolescents with giant cell tumour of the bone whose bones have stopped growing. The use of 
XGEVA has not been studied in children and adolescents with other cancers that have spread to bone. 
Other medicines and XGEVA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important that you 
tell your doctor if you are being treated with 
• 
• 
another medicine containing denosumab 
a bisphosphonate 
You should not take XGEVA together with other medicines containing denosumab or 
bisphosphonates. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
XGEVA has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant. XGEVA is not recommended for use if you are 
pregnant. Women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while being 
treated with XGEVA and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with XGEVA. 
If you become pregnant during treatment with XGEVA or less than 5 months after stopping treatment 
with XGEVA, please inform your doctor. 
It is not known whether XGEVA is excreted in breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you 
are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop 
breast-feeding or whether to stop taking XGEVA, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby 
and the benefit of XGEVA to the mother. 
If you are nursing during treatment with XGEVA, please inform your doctor. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
XGEVA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
XGEVA contains sorbitol 
This medicine contains 78 mg sorbitol in each vial. 
XGEVA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use XGEVA 
XGEVA should be administered under the responsibility of a healthcare professional. 
The recommended dose of XGEVA is 120 mg administered once every 4 weeks, as a single injection 
under the skin (subcutaneous). XGEVA will be injected into your thigh, abdomen or upper arm. If you 
are being treated for giant cell tumour of bone, you will receive an additional dose 1 week and 2 weeks 
after the first dose. 
Do not shake. 
You should also take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with XGEVA unless 
you have an excess of calcium in the blood. Your doctor will discuss this with you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

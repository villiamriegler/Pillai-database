reproductive organs were observed (see section 5.3). The 
data from two dedicated Phase 2 clinical studies (MANTA 
and MANTA RAay, n=240) to evaluate the human testicular 
safety in men with inflammatory arthritis diseases and 
inflammatory bowel diseases did not reveal a difference 
between treatment groups in the proportion of patients 
who had a 50% or more decrease from baseline in semen 
parameters at week 13 (pooled primary endpoint: filgotinib 
6.7%, placebo 8.3%) and at week 26. Further, the data did 
not show any relevant changes in sex hormone levels or 
change from baseline in semen parameters across 
treatment groups. Overall, these clinical data were not 
suggestive of filgotinib-related effects on testicular 
function. For more information, please refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Animal studies did not indicate effects with respect to 
fertility in females.

term extension (LTE) study, GS US 417 0304 (FINCH 4) 
were submitted.  
Across all filgotinib Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, the 
overall exposure adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of herpes 
zoster was numerically higher in the 200 mg group (1.6) 
compared to the 100 mg group (1.1). In rheumatoid 
arthritis clinical studies, the risk of herpes zoster appeared 
to be higher in female patients, Asian patients, patients ≥ 
50 years of age, patients with a medical history of herpes 
zoster, patients with a medical history of chronic lung 
disease and patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg once 
daily. Accordingly, recommendation of immunisations prior 
to initiation of filgotinib treatment was updated to include 
prophylactic zoster vaccination.  
Based on the data from 12-week placebo-controlled period 
for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received 
filgotinib 200 mg, the frequency of lymphopenia (1.0%) 
was added in the overall description of the most commonly 
reported adverse reactions and table of adverse reactions 
in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Dose dependent decreases in serum phosphate levels 
occurred during treatment with filgotinib up to week 24. 
These were generally mild, transient or intermittent, and 
resolved without discontinuation of treatment.

based on data obtained from the drug-drug interaction 
order to reflect new pharmacokinetic information on 
the effect of filgotinib on OATP/CYP3A, OATP/BCRP, 
and OATP substrates based on final results from 
study GS-US-417-5937; this is a Phase 1, 
randomized, two-way crossover, open-label, single 
and multiple dose, single center study to evaluate 
the effect of filgotinib on a mixed OATP/CYP3A, 
OATP/BCRP, and OATP substrates using phenotypic 
probes; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 2.1 is accepted.

study GS US 417 5937, designed to investigate the effect 
of multiple doses of filgotinib on OATPs using three OATP1 
substrates - atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin. 
Data demonstrated a low potential of drug drug 
interactions for filgotinib through inhibition of OATPs. The 
modest increase in rosuvastatin exposure (AUC and Cmax 
of 42% and 68%, respectively) when co-administered with 
filgotinig was not considered clinically relevant. Therefore, 
filgotinib co-administration with OATP substrates does not 
warrant dose adjustment. 
Consequently, sections 4.5. and 5.2 have been updated by 
removing the statements “In vitro studies indicate that 
filgotinib and its primary metabolite GS 829845 are 
inhibitors of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. No clinical studies 
have been performed to investigate interactions with 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be 
excluded that co administration of filgotinib with OATP1B1 
or OATP1B3 substrates may increase their exposure and 
the risk of adverse events. Co administration with sensitive 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., valsartan, statins) 
Page 7/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is therefore not recommended.” and “In vitro data indicate 
that filgotinib and GS 829845 have the potential to inhibit 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1 (filgotinib only), and 
MATE 2K.”, respectively.

TOFACITINIB RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
RMP version to be assessed as part of this application:
RMP Version number: 31.2
Data-lock point for this RMP: 28 February 2023
Date of final sign off: 25 September 2023
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
The primary purpose for submitting an updated RMP is to address the PRAC Rapporteur’s 
preliminary assessment report (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004214/II/0054) as described 
below in “Summary of significant changes in this RMP.”
Summary of significant changes in this RMP (version 31.2):
Part III.2: Rationale and Study Objectives and Milestones for the Drug Utilisation Study in 
France (A3921403) were updated to “TBD” as they are under assessment in MEA 25.1.
RABBIT (A3921317): the objective “higher incidence of AEs in elderly patients” was 
reverted back to “higher incidence and severity of AEs in elderly patients,” because this 
protocol amendment has not been submitted and approved.
BIKER/JuMBO (A3921407): The end of data collection year was updated from 2030 to 2032 
as per the endorsed protocol (EMEA/H/004214/MEA/018.3).
Part III.3: Summary of Objectives and Milestones for the Drug Utilisation Study in France 
(A3921403) were updated to “TBD” as they are under assessment in MEA 25.1.
RABBIT (A3921317): the objective “higher incidence of AEs in elderly patients” was 
reverted back to “higher incidence and severity of AEs in elderly patients,” because this 
protocol amendment has not been submitted and approved.
BIKER/JuMBO (A3921407): The end of data collection year was updated from 2030 to 2032 
as per the endorsed protocol (EMEA/H/004214/MEA/018.3).
Part V.2: The objectives “Decrease in lymphocyte counts and lymphopenia” and “Lipid 
elevations and hyperlipidaemia” were removed from the Prescriber Brochure. 
The objective “Decrease in neutrophil counts and neutropenia” was removed from the 
Prescriber Brochure and Prescriber Checklist.
Part V.3: Under “Higher incidence and severity of AEs in the elderly,” the existing note for 
“incidence only” for the 4 European RA registries was updated to “incidence only for 
ARTIS, BIOBADASER, BSRBR,” for consistency as per the update in Part III.
Page 1
Part VI.II.B: Under “Higher incidence and severity of AEs in the elderly,” the existing note 
for “incidence only” for the 4 European RA registries was updated to “incidence only for 
ARTIS, BIOBADASER, BSRBR,” for consistency as per the update in Part III.
Part VI.II.C: RABBIT (A3921317): the objective “higher incidence of AEs in elderly 
patients” was reverted back to “higher incidence and severity of AEs in elderly patients” for 
consistency as per the update in Part III.
Part VII, Annex 2: Summary of Objectives and Milestones for the Drug Utilisation Study in 
France (A3921403) were updated to “TBD” as per Part III.
RABBIT (A3921317): the objective “higher incidence of AEs in elderly patients” was 
reverted back to “higher incidence and severity of AEs in elderly patients” as per Part III.
BIKER/JuMBO (A3921407): The end of data collection year was updated from 2030 to 2032 
as per the endorsed protocol (EMEA/H/004214/MEA/018.3).
Part VII, Annex 3: The protocol approval date (18 September 2023) was added for 
BIKER/JuMBO (A3921407), Swedish JIA Clinical Registry (A3921408), and UK JIA 
Biologics Register (A3921409) studies (EMEA/H/004214/MEA/018.3-020.3).
Part VII, Annex 8: Updated to reflect changes in EU RMP version 31.2.
Other RMP versions under evaluation:
None.

Centralised
Chemical class: Tofacitinib, a heterocyclic small molecule, is a 
selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases 
with a high degree of selectivity against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and 
to a lesser extent TyK2.
Summary of mode of action: Tofacitinib is a potent, selective 
inhibitor of the JAK family of kinases with a high degree of 
selectivity against other kinases in the human genome.  In kinase 
assays, tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser 
extent tyrosine kinase 2 (TyK2).  In cellular settings where JAK 
kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling 
by heterodimeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 
with functional selectivity over receptors that signal via pairs of 
JAK2. Inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib blocks 
signalling through the common gamma chain containing receptors 
for several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, 
and -21.  These cytokines are integral to lymphocyte activation, 
development, homeostasis, proliferation, and function; therefore, 
inhibition of their signalling may result in modulation of multiple 
aspects of the immune response.  In addition, inhibition of JAK1 
will result in attenuation of signalling by additional pro-
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and interferon (IFN)γ. At 
higher exposures, inhibition of erythropoietin could occur via 
inhibition of JAK2 signalling. 
Important information about its composition:

Module 1.3.1
Current: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), film-coated tablets and prolonged-
release tablets: Tofacitinib, in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX), is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe active RA 
in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are 
intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs).  Tofacitinib can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate.
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), film-coated tablets and prolonged-release 
tablets: Tofacitinib in combination with MTX is indicated for the 
treatment of active PsA in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior 
DMARD therapy.
Ulcerative colitis (UC), film-coated tablets: Tofacitinib is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost 
response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a 
biologic agent.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA): Tofacitinib is indicated for the 
treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] or negative [RF-] polyarthritis 
and extended oligoarthritis), and juvenile PsA in patients 2 years 
of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous 
therapy with DMARDs.
Tofacitinib can be given in combination with MTX or as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued 
treatment with MTX is inappropriate.
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), film-coated tablets and prolonged-
release tablets: Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with active AS who have responded inadequately to 
conventional therapy.
Current: 
RA, film-coated tablets and prolonged-release tablets: 
Film-coated tablets: the recommended dose is 5 mg administered 
twice daily, which should not be exceeded.
Prolonged-release tablets: the recommended dose is one 11 mg 
prolonged-release tablet administered once daily, which should 
not be exceeded.
No dose adjustment is required when used in combination with 
MTX.
Switching between tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets and 
tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets:
Patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice 
daily may be switched to tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release 
tablets once daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 
5 mg film-coated tablets. 
Patients treated with tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets 
once daily may be switched to tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets 
twice daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 11 mg 
prolonged-release tablets.
Tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged release tablets once daily has 
demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC and Cmax) to 
tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily.
Page 19
PsA, film-coated tablets and prolonged-release tablets: 
Film-coated tablets: the recommended dose is 5 mg administered 
twice daily, which should not be exceeded.  No dose adjustment is 
required when used in combination with MTX.
Prolonged-release tablets: the recommended dose is one 11 mg 
prolonged-release tablet administered once daily, which should 
not be exceeded.
Switching between tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets and 
tofacitinib 5mg film-coated tablets:
Treatment with tofacitinib 5 mg film coated tablets twice daily and 
tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged release tablets once daily may be 
switched between each other on the day following the last dose of 
either tablet.
Tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged release tablets once daily have 
demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC and Cmax) to 
tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily.
No dose adjustment is required when used in combination with 
MTX.
Tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged release tablets once daily have 
demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC and Cmax) to 
tofacitinib 5 mg film coated tablets twice daily.
UC, film-coated tablets:
Induction treatment
The recommended dose is 10 mg given orally twice daily for 
induction for 8 weeks.  For patients who do not achieve adequate 
therapeutic benefit by week 8, the induction dose of 10 mg twice 
daily can be extended for an additional 8 weeks (16 weeks total), 
followed by 5 mg twice daily for maintenance.  Tofacitinib 
induction therapy should be discontinued in any patient who 
shows no evidence of therapeutic benefit by week 16.  
Maintenance treatment
The recommended dose for maintenance treatment is 5 mg given 
orally twice daily. 
Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for maintenance treatment is not 
recommended in patients with UC who have known venous 
thromboembolism (VTE), MACE and malignancy risk factors, 
unless there is no suitable alternative treatment available.
For patients with UC who are not at increased risk for VTE, 
MACE and malignancy, tofacitinib 10 mg orally twice daily may 
be considered if the patient experiences a decrease in response on 
tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily and failed to respond to alternative 
treatment options for ulcerative colitis such as tumour necrosis 
factor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor) treatment. Tofacitinib 10 mg twice 
daily for maintenance treatment should be used for the shortest 
duration possible. 
The lowest effective dose needed to maintain response should be 
used.
In patients who have responded to treatment with tofacitinib, 
corticosteroids may be reduced and/or discontinued in accordance 
with standard of care.
Retreatment in UC
If therapy is interrupted, restarting treatment with tofacitinib can 
be considered. If there has been a loss of response, reinduction 
with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily may be considered. The 
Page 20
treatment interruption period in clinical studies extended up to 1 
year. Efficacy may be regained by 8 weeks of 10 mg twice daily 
therapy.
Polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA (children between 2 and 18 
years of age)
Tofacitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
MTX.
The recommended dose in patients 2 years of age and older is 
based upon the following weight categories:
Table 1. Tofacitinib dose for patients with polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis and juvenile PsA two years of age and older:

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
In what follows, the epidemiology of RA, PsA, UC, JIA, and AS is described with a focus on 
Europe and North America.
Indication: Rheumatoid Arthritis
Incidence: The majority of studies from Northern European and North American areas 
estimate a mean annual incidence of 0.02%-0.05%.1  A recent model estimated an incidence 
of 26/100,000 in the Australasia region compared to 24/100,000 in Western Europe and 
23/100,000 in high income North America.2  Table 1 summarises estimates across Europe 
and North America, which range from 8.8 to 98.0 in men and women combined per 100,000

Prevalence: The majority of studies from Northern Europe and North America estimate 
prevalence between 0.5%-1.0%.1  The estimated age-standardised prevalence of RA in 2010 
was estimated as 0.44% in Western Europe and high income North America.2
Table 2 summarises RA prevalence estimates across European countries per 1000 inhabitants 
(based on 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria).  Differences may reflect true 
geographic differences in prevalence and regional variation in case ascertainment.

Demographics of the population in the authorised indication–age, gender, racial and/or
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: RA incidence increases with age and 
plateaus around age 60.32  A female-to-male ratio of approximately 2.5:1 has been noted.32  
Racial and ethnic minorities have higher disability scores, worse global health assessments, 
greater burden of co-morbidities and delayed treatment initiation when compared with 
Caucasians.33,34,35,36,37,38
A combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioural factors may influence 
susceptibility to and clinical course of RA, with smoking, female gender, age, and human 
leukocyte antigen-shared epitope the most reproduced findings.39
The main existing treatment options: Currently, there is no cure for RA.  The purpose of 
treatment is to control disease activity, alleviate signs and symptoms, maintain physical

function, optimise quality of life, reduce the rate of joint damage, and, if possible, induce 
complete remission.40  There are 3 general classes of drugs commonly used in the treatment 
of RA: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and DMARDs
(conventional synthetic DMARDs [csDMARDs], biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs] and 
targeted synthetic (ts) DMARD such as tofacitinib).
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: RA is associated with a 1.3 to 3-fold increased risk of mortality 
relative to persons without RA of the same age and gender.41,42,43,17,44  Predictors of survival 
are related to RA disease severity and the presence of complications and co-
morbidities.41,43,45,46  Research suggests that RA therapies may modify risk in some 
populations.47,48,49
Causes of death appear similar to those in the general population overall.  Some, however, 
have noted more deaths attributed to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), infections and 
malignancies.41,44,50
Bone and cartilage destruction result in functional decline and disability.51  A recent 
systematic review of 31 studies of health related quality of life among RA patients found 
consistent reports of reduced physical function and increased pain compared with other 
chronic conditions such as Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and diabetes.  Mental health 
measures were also lower than other chronic diseases such as diabetes, CHF, hypertension 
and Myocardial Infarction (MI).  Further, RA patients have reduced vitality, social 
functioning, and emotional well-being relative to the population.52
Important co-morbidities: The key comorbidities associated with RA are osteoporosis
(including related fractures) 53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65 and depression. 66,67,68,69,70,71,

Indication: Psoriatic Arthritis
Incidence: Studies from Europe and the US report incidence rates of PsA ranging from 2.2 
to 43.4 per 100,000 (Table 3).  Epidemiologic estimates (eg, incidence, prevalence, mortality 
rates) of PsA may vary as a result of lack of a standard case definition, differences in genetics 
across different geographic and ethnic groups, exposure to environmental factors, and study 
methods.

Prevalence: The prevalence of PsA was estimated in several population-based studies in 
Europe and the US, where age-adjusted prevalence estimates of PsA per 10,000 persons were 
reported as follows: Czech Republic 4.91 (95% CI 3.95-6.04),78 Greece 5.66 (95% CI: 4.99-
6.32),79 Turkey (Thrace region; not age-adjusted) 2.79 (95% CI, 2.37-3.21),81 Iceland 
(Reykjavik area; also sex-adjusted) 13.9 (11.2-16.9),82 and US (also sex-adjusted) 6.84 (95% 
CI, 5.4-8.4).83
A population-based retrospective study conducted among 4.8 million patients in the United 
Kingdom (UK) reported an overall prevalence of 19 per 10,000 persons.84  In the Nord-
Trøndelag Health Study 3 in Norway, the prevalence of PsA was reported to be 67 per 
10,000 persons (95% CI 59-74) in patients older than 20 years of age, with no significant 
difference in prevalence between men and women.80
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication–age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: Most cases of PsA occur when subjects are 
in their mid-forties.  Most European and US studies have identified no gender difference in 
the risk of developing PsA.85  One study including US veterans of 78 PsA patients reported 
that twice as many Caucasians as African Americans had PsA (64.5 vs. 30.0%, respectively, 
p<0.001).86
Several studies have examined risk factors for PsA and have suggested that psoriasis (PsO) 
severity, nail dystrophy,85 smoking,87 excessive alcohol consumption,88 trauma, prior 
glucocorticoid use,85 acetaminophen and NSAID use,89 the absence of a C reactive gene 
polymorphism,90 vitamin D deficiency,91 and obesity,92,87 are all risk factors for PsA.  Ogdie 
et al also found obesity to be a significant independent risk factor of PsA among PsO 
patients.84
The main existing treatment options: The main pharmacologic treatment options for PsA 
include NSAIDs, topical and intraarticular corticosteroids, csDMARDs, bDMARDs, and 
tsDMARDs [conventional synthetic (cs), biologic (b), and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs].  
NSAIDs are the first line of therapy in PsA, and are effective at reducing pain and 
inflammation, but are rarely sufficient alone to control symptoms and have no demonstrated 
effect in limiting structural joint damage.93  Intra-articular and topical corticosteroids are 
used as an adjunct to systemic therapy to control oligoarthritis and skin disease, respectively.
Page 25
There are very few clinical study data to support the efficacy of csDMARDS in PsA (eg, 
methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, cyclophosphamide, oral gold).  CsDMARDs have 
limited evidence for efficacy in slowing or preventing progressive joint damage, enthesitis, 
and severe dactylitis and also may be associated with poor clinical tolerability and/or safety 
issues.93,94
Of the bDMARDS, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) have demonstrated in published 
clinical studies evidence of both clinical efficacy and retardation of joint damage and 
acceptable safety in the treatment for PsA.95 Approved TNFi include infliximab, etanercept, 
adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab.  However, the use of TNFi remains limited with 
inconvenience of the required parenteral routes of administration and apparent loss of initial 
efficacy with continued use in a significant proportion of patients.  Ustekinumab is a 
parenteral interleukin (IL) 12/IL23i approved for the treatment of PsA.  Secukinumab is a 
parenteral IL17Ai approved for the treatment of PsA.  The use of these drugs is also limited 
by the inconvenience of parenteral administration.  Abatacept, a selective T cell 
costimulation modulator, used alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with active PsA when the response to previous DMARD therapy 
including MTX has been inadequate, and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic 
skin lesions is not required.  
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: Data are limited regarding mortality in subjects with PsA.  In a 
population-based medical record review study in Minnesota, US, Shbeeb et al reported that 
survival of persons with PsA was not significantly different from that of the local general 
population (p = 0.546).96 In a more recent retrospective cohort study conducted using the UK 
THIN database, Ogdie et al reported that the mortality rate of subjects with PsA was 10.37 
deaths per 1000 PYs (7.80 for patients using DMARDs, and 12.46 for patients not using 
DMARDs).97  
Important co-morbidities: The key comorbidities associated with PsA are 
hypertension,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,87,97 metabolic syndrome,108,109,104 diabetes,110,111,101,
97,98,102,103,105,107 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (data from epidemiologic studies on the 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality in PsA patients were not identified in the literature), 
inflammatory bowel disease (includes Crohn’s Disease),101 and plaque psoriasis.77
Indication: Ulcerative Colitis
Incidence: A recent study evaluated data from 31 medical centers across Western and 
Eastern Europe (including Cyprus, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greece, Greenland, 
Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK, Croatia, Czech Republic, 
Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, and Russia), representing a total 
background population of approximately 10.1 million people, and estimated the annual 
incidence of UC in 2010 to be 8.2 per 100,000 European adults age >15 years.  Incidence 
varied by Western vs. Eastern European region, and also between various regions within 
certain countries like Denmark, from 2.5 per 100,000 residents of Timis, Romania to 31.8 per 
100,000 residents of the Faroe Islands (Denmark).112  
Page 26
Population-based estimates of UC incidence are similar across North American regions.  
During the period 2000-2010, UC incidence among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota 
(US) was 12.2 per 100,000 PY.113  Within that same timeframe, UC incidence in Ontario, 
Canada was 12.1 per 100,000 PY114 and in Nova Scotia, Canada it was 16.7 per 100,000 
PY.115
Prevalence: UC prevalence estimates for European populations vary widely, from 2.4 per 
100,000 persons in Romania to 505 per 100,000 persons in Norway.116  The EMA’s draft 
Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative 
Colitis (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP]/Efficacy Working Party 
[EWP]/18463/2006 Revision 1), estimates prevalence to be 70 to 500 cases per 100,000.117
The patterns are inconsistent within individual European regions; however, data from 
multiple countries suggest increasing prevalence over time.116
In the US and Canada, depending on the region and study period the estimated prevalence of 
UC (per 100,000 persons) ranged from 37.5 (in Alberta, Canada) to 248.6 (in Manitoba, 
Canada); all but 2 studies reported prevalence estimates greater than 155 per 100,000 
persons.116
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication–age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: Although UC can occur at any age, the peak 
age of onset is between 15 and 25 years117 with the majority of patients diagnosed between 
ages 30-40 years.118  Some studies indicate a second peak for age at onset between 60-80 
years;118 119 however, consensus on this is lacking.118  While most studies demonstrate either 
higher UC incidence among men or equal rates for men and women,118 a recent study of 
approximately 10.2 million beneficiaries of US military health care (Tricare) reported a 
slightly greater risk for UC among women (relative risk [RR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.32-1.39).120  
For the subset of the sample with data on race (approximately 3.5 million Tricare 
beneficiaries), UC prevalence was higher among whites (194 cases per 100,000 persons) 
followed by blacks (150 cases per 100,000 persons) as compared to Asian, Hispanic, and 
American Indian individuals (range: 100-115 cases per 100,000 persons).120
There is a hereditary component to UC,121,122 with a nationwide study in Denmark 
demonstrating anywhere from 1.5-4.1 times the risk of UC among first-, second-, or third-
degree relatives of UC patients.122  Jewish ancestry has also been associated with UC.123,124  
In addition, diet may contribute to UC risk, particularly high consumption of sugar and soft 
drinks in combination with minimal intake of vegetables125 and/or greater intake of 
monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats.126
The main existing treatment options: The primary goal of therapy for UC is to rapidly 
induce remission when the disease is in an acute flare and to maintain remission without 
long-term use of corticosteroids.127  Considerations for treatment options include the severity 
and extent of disease, prior response to therapies and patient preference.
Current treatment options for moderately to severely active UC include corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine [AZA] and 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]), tumour 
Page 27
necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) agents (infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab), and an 
anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab).  
Colectomy is generally considered the last resort and is indicated only for complications such 
as uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding, dysplasia/carcinoma, disease unresponsive to 
medical therapies, and intolerable medication side effects.128
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: Depending on the level of disease activity, UC has the potential to 
cause a significant burden to both the patient and the health care system in terms of 
decreasing one’s health-related quality of life with extensive morbidities that often require 
surgery and/or hospitalization.129  Within 10 years of the UC diagnosis, approximately 10% 
of patients undergo colectomy surgery; in some regions, like Northern Europe, colectomy 
rates are even higher.130  Compared to the general population, UC patients have 
approximately twice the risk of colorectal cancer (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.39, 
95% CI 2.10-2.73), with a cumulative colorectal cancer risk of 1.1-5.3% within 20 years of 
UC diagnosis.130  
Results from mortality studies of UC patients vary depending on a broad range of factors 
such as the population evaluated and underlying health care system.  A population-based 
study in Norway observed no differences in either total mortality or cause-specific mortality 
rates among UC patients compared to the general population.131  However, a recent Canadian 
study reported statistically higher mortality due to any cause (SMR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.32), 
digestive conditions (SMR 4.57, 95% CI 3.20-6.52), infectious diseases (SMR 2.08, 95% CI 
1.29-3.35), and respiratory conditions (SMR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.84) among UC patients 
compared to the general population.132   
Important co-morbidities: The key comorbidities associated with UC are 
anaemia,133,134,135,136,137,138 depression,139,140 anxiety,139 bone disease,135 osteopenia,135
osteoporosis,135 epithelial dysplasia, and colorectal carcinoma.141
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)
JIA is the newest classification system used to describe a heterogeneous group of 
inflammatory arthritides diagnosed in persons aged 16 or younger.  This system is intended 
to replace the earlier classification systems used by the American College of Rheumatology 
and the European League Against Rheumatism (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and Juvenile 
Chronic Arthritis, respectively), with the intent of unifying diagnostic criteria and 
standardizing research definitions.  Each of the 3 systems differs slightly in its approach to 
classifying subtypes of juvenile arthritis.  Therefore, any evaluation of epidemiologic data 
must consider the classification system used in the study.
Incidence: A systematic literature review of juvenile idiopathic arthritis for studies published 
from 1972 to 2011 reported a pooled incidence rate of 8.2 per 100,000 children.142
Observational studies specific to Europe and North America suggest incidence rates that 
range between 3.2 and 21.7 cases per 100,000 children per year (Table 4).  The reports on 
incidence rates of JIA differ depending on the study design and geographic region.143
Page 28
Incidence studies are limited in precision due to the small number of new subjects who 
present with juvenile arthritis each year, which results in large confidence intervals for 
individual studies, as well as large differences in estimates across studies.

Prevalence: A systematic literature review of JIA for studies published from 1972 to 2011 
reported a pooled prevalence of 70.2 per 100,000 children.142 Observational studies specific 
to Europe and North America suggest prevalence that ranges between 15.7 (0.02%) and 83.7 
(0.08%) cases per 100,000 children per year (Table 4). 
A difficulty in estimating prevalence is that studies may either include children who are 
currently symptomatic or they may include children who have ever had a diagnosis, 
regardless of current symptoms.  Estimates are influenced by study design, and especially 
setting, where clinic-based studies often suggest lower prevalence estimates than community-
based studies.  Although some subjects achieve complete remission post-adolescence, many 
children remain symptomatic throughout life and will always be considered juvenile arthritis 
Page 29
subjects, even as adults.  Prevalence studies often do not include adult-aged subjects with 
JIA;156 this should be considered when using prevalence estimates to extrapolate the total 
number of cases in a population.
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication–age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: The age and gender distribution for JIA 
varies greatly by subtype; however, across all subtypes, JIA is more prevalent in females than 
males, with an overall female to male ratio of 1.5-2 to 1.0.157  In a systematic review of JIA 
studies published from 1972 to 2011, incidence rates for JIA varied from 2.9 to 35.4 per 
100,000 children for females and from 1.7 to 19.3 per 100,000 children for males.  The 
overall pooled incidence rate was 10.0 per 100,000 children for females and 5.7 per 100,000 
children for males.142  For age, the pooled incidence was 8.7 for the age group of 0–4 years, 
6.1 for the age group of 5–9 years, and 9.6 per 100,000 children for the age group of 10–15 
years.142  
A Canadian study of ethnicity in subjects with JIA found that subjects of European descent 
were more likely to develop any of the JIA subtypes, except RF positive polyarticular JIA, 
than were subjects of Indian, Asian, or African descent, and they were especially more likely 
to develop the extended oligoarticular and psoriatic subtypes; the ethnic distribution varied 
by subtype of JIA.158  However, a US study suggested that Caucasian and African American 
children had similar rates of JIA.156  Further, studies have reported geographic differences in 
the epidemiology of JIA, even within a single country.  It is unclear whether these 
differences are due to environmental factors, genetic differences, or a combination of the 
two.
Like other autoimmune diseases, risk of developing JIA is thought to be determined by a 
complex combination of genetic and environmental risk factors.159 Girls and older children 
are at increased risk. 150 153 There may be genetic susceptibility, and several candidate genes 
are under study.159 160  Some authors have hypothesised vaccinations may trigger the disease 
in those genetically predisposed, but studies have not supported a link to vaccines.160 Some 
infections can lead to transient post-infectious arthritis, usually lasting only a few weeks; 
however this can occasionally become chronic, resembling JIA.159   Early-life risk factors 
include not having been breastfed and maternal smoking.159
The main existing treatment options: Conventional treatment options for pJIA include 
local glucocorticoid injections, systemic glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), and conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs).161 162
csDMARDs are first-line therapy for the treatment of pJIA due to their proven ability to 
minimize joint damage and improve symptoms.  Methotrexate (MTX) is the most widely 
used csDMARD; side effects such as gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity are often associated 
with its use.163 164
Biological DMARDS (bDMARDs), which are directed at extracellular targets such as 
individual soluble cytokines, have revolutionized the treatment of pJIA, especially in those 
who fail to respond to csDMARDs.165 163  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors were the 
Page 30
first bDMARD approved for the treatment of pJIA, are the most widely used class of 
bDMARDs, and have been shown to lead to significant improvement in the reduction of 
signs and symptoms of pJIA.  Since their approval, several other classes of bDMARDs have 
also been approved for use in pJIA (IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, selective T cell 
costimulation modulator).166  Despite the many benefits of bDMARDs, there are still 
downsides to their use in children with pJIA such as route of administration (parenteral) and 
the potential development of anti-drug antibodies which can result in loss of efficacy over 
time.   
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:  JIA is a chronic disease characterized by prolonged synovial 
inflammation that may cause structural joint damage.167 Nonreversible abnormalities may 
also occur in extra-articular organs, such as the eye (as a complication of iridocyclitis) or the 
kidney (due to systemic amyloidosis), or may result from adverse effects of drug therapies.167
One of the most significant complications of JIA is anterior uveitis. The risk of uveitis is 
based on the JIA subtype, age at disease onset, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) status. The 
highest risk group of patients is oligoarticular JIA, especially if the patient is female, ANA-
positive, and less than 4 years of age.168 JIA may be complicated by linear or localized 
growth disturbance. Linear growth abnormalities are particularly observed in patients with 
chronic active disease and are therefore most common in children with polyarthritis or 
systemic JIA.168
Using subject hospitalization records in Scotland, findings of a study of children with JIA 
suggested that the overall mortality was elevated 3-5 fold over the general population.169  The 
Rochester Epidemiology Project database tracked 57 subjects with a history of JIA into 
adulthood.  Four deaths occurred among these subjects (compared to one expected death).  
Although this finding is statistically significant, the small sample size limits the 
generalizability of this finding in JIA subjects overall.  Of note, all deaths were attributable to 
complications from other autoimmune diseases.170  Studies of mortality among subjects with 
JIA have estimated that the standardized mortality rate is 3 to 14 times greater than that of 
the general age-matched US population.171
Important co-morbidities: The key comorbidities associated with JIA are growth 
retardation172,173,174; osteopenia175,176,177; uveitis178,179,180 ; and diabetes181,182
Indication: Ankylosing Spondylitis
Incidence: The crude annual incidence of AS was reported as 7.2 per 100,000 among those 
18-45 years old in Spain183 and the age-standardised incidence as 6.4 per 100,000 in the 
Czech Republic.184  A Danish study estimated incidence raging between 0.5 to 1.2 per 
100,000 among men and 0.2 to 0.8 per 100,000 among women in the time period of 2000 to 
2013.185
In a study from the US, the average age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AS in the period 1980 
to 2010 was estimated at 3.1 per 100,000, with little variation over time.186  In Canada, a 
higher incidence of AS between 11 and 15 per 100,000 has been reported.187, 188
Page 31
Prevalence: The overall (pooled) prevalence of AS has been estimated at 25 per 100,000 in 
Europe and 20 per 100,000 in North America.189  By country, the reported prevalence in 
Europe and North America ranges from 6 to 60 per 100,000 inhabitants (Table 5).  The 
variation in prevalence may be due to difference in case definitions and study design, as well 
as the occurrence of risk factors in the population.

Demographics of the population in the authorised indication–age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Patients with AS are relatively young with onset reported at an average age of 25.228  The 
average age in population-based studies ranged from 30 to 54 years, and in most cohorts the 
majority (60-75%) of AS patients were male.185, 231, 232, 202, 196, 189, 197, 195, 230, 229, 228
Ethnicity has been studied and a US study showed that Blacks with AS have more severe 
disease compared to either Whites or Latinos.203  In Canada the prevalence of AS was 
considerably higher among First nations (60 per 10,000) than Non-First nations (20 per 
10,000).  The result is considered to be linked to the higher prevalence of HLA-B27 gene 
among First nations.201
The aetiology of AS has a strong genetic component with more than 90% of AS patients 
being carrier of the HLA-B27 gene, compared to only 6.1% in the general population.224
Environmental risk factors mentioned in the literature includes childhood infection204 and 
smoking.205
The main existing treatment options: For many decades, the mainstay of treatment of AS 
has been NSAIDs and structured exercise programs including physical therapy with the aim 
of relieving clinical symptoms.206  However, gastrointestinal and other adverse effects limit 
the tolerability of NSAIDs including some COX-2 selective inhibitors.207, 208  In addition, AS 
patients report insufficient control with NSAIDs alone. 209  Treatment with csDMARDs that 
Page 32
have shown efficacy in RA have not shown similar efficacy in AS.210, 211  Sulfasalazine may 
provide some benefits for peripheral arthritis but does not impact axial disease.212, 213  
Locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids are also a treatment option for patients with 
active enthesitis, sacroiliitis or peripheral arthritis that have not responded fully to NSAID 
therapy.214, 215  However, although local corticosteroid injections are widely used in clinical 
practice to good effect in AS patients, no clinical trials exist to support this use. 214  
TNFα antagonists or inhibitors, also known as TNFi, have demonstrated efficacy and are 
approved for the reduction of clinical signs and symptoms, in patients with AS.  A recent
ASAS-EULAR recommendation stated that TNFi therapy is indicated for those patients with
persistently high disease activity despite conventional treatment.216  Additional bDMARDs 
that inhibit IL-17, secukinumab and ixekizumab, have been subsequently approved in the US.
However, there is a substantial proportion of patients who have an inadequate response to 
each of these bDMARDs217, 218, 219, 220 and as such therapy options are administered 
parenterally, this may act as an additional barrier to their use.221  Moreover, the long-term 
efficacy of some TNFi and anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody (mAb) may be limited by 
immunogenicity.222, 223
Current updates to the ACR AS treatment guidelines provide initial therapy 
recommendations based upon an individual’s disease activity and/or risk factors.215  Based on 
the current evidence and the considerations of the ACR panel, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the 
primary classes of medications for the treatment of AS, with sulfasalazine recommended 
only for persistent peripheral arthritis when TNFi are not appropriate.  Secukinumab or 
ixekizumab are recommended for patients with active disease who have heart failure or 
demyelinating disease as a contraindication to TNFi, and in primary nonresponders to TNFi.  
Secukinumab and ixekizumab are not recommended in patients with IBD or recurrent uveitis, 
as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options.215  
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity: 
Progressive structural damage to the axial or peripheral skeleton resulting in irreversible 
physical impairment is the primary morbidity associated with AS.224  The most common 
initial symptoms of AS are low back pain and sacroiliac joint syndrome (Table 6).

Extra-articular manifestations (i.e. IBD, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis and 
uveitis) are conditions associated with AS, as is GI and joint inflammation.224  Patients with 
AS also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.224, 225  It has been estimated that 2-
10% of patients with AS have cardiac manifestations224 and the elevated risk is only partially 
attributable to traditional risk factors such as comorbid hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, 
obesity, and metabolic syndrome, even though the prevalence of these disorders is also 
increased in the AS population.225
Considering the large number and wide range of comorbidities in this patient group, a
substantial increase in mortality might be expected.  However, few reports on increased 
mortality have been published.  Two studies were found that reported an increased mortality 
risk of about 60% among AS patients compared to non-AS groups,226 , 227 whereas another 
study found no difference in mortality rate between AS patients and the general 
population186.
Important co-morbidities: Comorbidities associated with AS are cardiovascular 
disease,228,229,230,231 hypertension,228,229,231 diabetes,228,229 malignancies,228,231 asthma,228,231

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
Tofacitinib has undergone a comprehensive toxicological evaluation in mice, rats, rabbits, 
and monkeys in studies up to 2 years in duration.  Safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted in vitro and in vivo (rats, mice, and monkeys) to assess potential effects on 
cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurofunctional endpoints.  In vitro and in vivo genetic 
toxicology studies (microbial reverse mutation, mammalian cell gene mutation, in vitro 
cytogenetics, in vivo micronucleus, unscheduled deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis) were 
conducted to assess the genotoxic potential of tofacitinib.  Chronic toxicity assessment was 
conducted in rats and monkeys.  Carcinogenicity was assessed in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic 
mouse study and a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study.  Additionally, investigative mechanistic 
studies, reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity studies, and 
other local tolerance studies have been conducted.  Studies in juvenile rats and monkeys were 
conducted to support the paediatric plan.  The citrate salt (tofacitinib citrate; CP 690,550-10) 
was used in most nonclinical studies and was administered primarily by the oral route as this 
is the intended route of administration to humans.  Table 7 provides a summary of key safety 
findings from the tofacitinib non-clinical studies.
Table 7. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studiesa
Toxicity:
 Acute toxicity including important results from 
safety pharmacology studies (eg cardiovascular 
including potential for QT prolongation, CNS, 
etc.)
Single-Dose Findings

In single-dose rat studies, death, decreased activity, 
laboured breathing, LFT increases, and decreases in 
eosinophils, and fibrinogen, decreases in 
lymphocytes in splenic white pulp, and 
lymphocytolysis of mesenteric lymph node and 
spleen were noted.  The findings in rats occurred at 
high exposure multiples of at least ~ 933/1879-fold 
or ~ 466/938-fold multiple for male/female based on 
the human unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID 
dose, respectively.
In an acute monkey study, emesis and decreased 
activity were observed.
 Repeat-dose toxicity (by target organ for 
toxicity)
The effects on the immune system that were 
observed in the rat and monkey toxicity studies were 
consistent with the intended pharmacologic activity, 
inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3.  The selectivity and 
severity of effects observed on the immune and 
haematopoietic system were reflected by specificity 
of tofacitinib for JAK1 and JAK3 and to a lesser 
extent JAK2 inhibition.
Relevance to Human Usage
Relevance to human usage is not expected based on 
the high exposure multiples at which effects occurred 
in the single-dose studies.
The level of the pharmacologic effect (JAK 
inhibition) may be dependent on dose and may result 
in immunosuppression (potential adverse effects) 
versus immunomodulation (potential efficacious 
effects).  In humans, the direct pharmacological 
effects of JAK inhibition may be modified by factors 
such as age, concomitant drugs, such as 
corticosteroids, or co-morbidities, such as diabetes.
The effects on NK cells, T cells, and lymphocyte 
depletion in lymphoid tissues is not an unexpected 
Page 35
Table 7. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studiesa
Decreases in numbers of circulating NK cells and T 
cells and lymphocyte depletion in lymphoid tissues 
were observed in both rat (≥1 mg/kg; ~ 1/2- or ~ 
0.4/1-fold multiple for male/female based on the 
human unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, 
respectively) and monkey (≥0.5mg/kg; ~ 0.1- or ~ 
0.2-fold multiple for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, 
respectively) toxicity studies.
Decreases in circulating B cells were observed in rats 
at doses 10 mg/kg/day (~ 9/21-fold or ~ 5/11-
fold for male/female based on the human unbound 
AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively), 
however, there were no tofacitinib-related decreases 
in B cells in monkeys or humans administered 
tofacitinib.
At higher exposure levels, decreases in RBC 
parameters (RBC, Hgb, and haematocrit), including 
reticulocytes, and platelets were observed in rats and 
monkeys.  Decreases in circulating eosinophils and 
basophils were also reported at 10 mg/kg in 6-week 
and 6-month studies in rats (~ 9/21-fold or ~ 5/11 
multiple for male/female based on the human 
unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, 
respectively).
At higher exposure levels, bacterial and viral 
infections secondary to immunosuppression by 
tofacitinib were observed in rat (100 mg/kg in female 
rat; ~ 189- or ~ 95-fold multiple based on the human 
unbound AUC at 5 mg or 10 mg BID dose) and 
monkey (50 mg/kg; ~ 23- or ~ 11-fold multiple 
based on the human unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 
mg BID dose, respectively) studies.
In the 39-week monkey study 3 of 8 monkeys in the 
high dose group (10 mg/kg/day; ~ 6- or ~ 3-fold 
multiple based on the human unbound AUC at the 5 
or 10 mg BID dose) were observed with lymphoma.  
Two (2) of these cases were confirmed LCV-related 
B-cell lymphomas.  The other lymphoma was a T 
cell lymphoma.
In the renal allograft study, 1 of 8 animals dosed with 
both tofacitinib and MMF had a single enlarged 
mesenteric lymph node, and based on microscopic 
evaluation was described as a lymphosarcoma.
Chronic immunosuppression in monkeys is 
associated with the development of PTLD.  The 
development of LCV (equivalent to EBV in 
humans)-associated B-cell lymphomas in monkeys 
administered tofacitinib is not unexpected since other 
immunomodulatory drugs produce lymphomas in

finding given the importance of γ-common chain 
cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21) in 
lymphocyte development and homeostasis.243,244,245  
Tofacitinib decreases circulating NK cell counts in 
patients; treatment-related decreases in total 
lymphocytes and circulating T cell lymphocytes may 
occur in some patients at therapeutic doses 
The effect on B cells in rats is consistent with 
findings that IL-7 and JAK3 deficient mice lack B 
cells whereas IL-7 and JAK3 deficient SCID humans 
have normal B-cell numbers.246,247,248,249,250,251  
Decreases in B cells in humans are not expected 
based on the differences in B-cell development 
between rodents and humans.
Effects on RBC parameters, reticulocytes and 
platelets were attributed to the inhibition of JAK2 
signalling by haematopoietic growth factors252 and 
cytokines critical for eosinophil (IL-5)253 and 
basophil (IL-3)254 development.  Effects on these 
parameters are possible in humans, especially at 
higher exposure to tofacitinib.  Thrombocytopenia 
has been observed in tofacitinib patients, but is not 
considered a treatment-related AE.
Immunosuppression leading to bacterial and viral 
infections may be observed in individual patients 
administered therapeutic doses of tofacitinib.
Lymphoproliferative effects and lymphoma have 
been observed in patients treated with tofacitinib. 
EBV- associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
disorder has been observed at an increased rate in 
renal transplant patients treated with tofacitinib and 
concomitant immunosuppressive medications.255
The majority of PTLD in humans are associated with 
EBV. 256  Although the exact mechanism for the 
pathogenesis of EBV-associated PTLD is not clear, 
there is substantial evidence that suggests that 
immunosuppressive therapy results in decreased

rhesus or cynomolgus 
monkeys.235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242  
For the 39-week monkey study, all of the monkeys 
were infected with LCV based on the presence of 
anti-LCV antibodies in prestudy serum samples.  
Thus, the LCV-associated B-cell lymphomas were 
not unexpected and were similar to the LCV/EBV 
positive B-cell lymphomas observed with PTLD 
cases in nonhuman primates.239 240 256 Therefore, the 
LCV-associated lymphomas observed in the 39-week 
monkey study were considered secondary to 
immunosuppression.
Lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia was observed in 
lymph nodes, GALT or spleen of individual animals 
at doses 0.5 mg/kg/day in the 39-week monkey 
study (~ 0.2- or ~ 0.1-fold multiple based on the 
human unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, 
respectively).  This lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia 
was not associated with LCV, and based on 
histological characteristics is not considered a 
precursor to lymphoma.
 Genotoxicity
In vitro, CP-690,550 did not induce microbial or 
mammalian gene mutations in the absence or 
presence of metabolic activation.  Reproducible 
increases in chromosomal abnormalities were 
observed in a human lymphocyte in vitro 
cytogenetic assay at high cytotoxic concentrations 
with metabolic activation, but no effects were 
observed without metabolic activation.  No evidence 
for chromosome damage was observed in an in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus study.  No DNA damage 
occurred in the in vivo/in vitro rat hepatocyte UDS 
assay.
 Carcinogenicity
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study 
tofacitinib -related neoplastic findings included: 
increases in benign Leydig cell tumours for males 
given 30 mg/kg/day; benign angiomas in the 
mesenteric lymph nodes only for males given 
10 mg/kg/day, which were not dose-dependent; 
benign thymomas (in thymus) for females 
administered 100/75 mg/kg/day; and malignant 
hibernomas for females given 30 mg/kg/day.  The 
exposure multiples for male/female rats were ~ 
11/22, 35/83, and 122/187 for the low, mid and high 
Relevance to Human Usage
numbers of EBV/LCV-specific cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes which are therefore unable to control 
the growth of EBV/LCV-transformed B 
cells.257,258,259,260  
The LCV-associated B-cell lymphomas were not 
unexpected and were similar to the LCV/EBV 
positive B-cell lymphomas observed with PTLD 
cases in humans.239, 240, 256
Relevance to human usage is not expected because 
the occurrence of simple reactive follicular lymphoid 
hyperplasia represents a normal immune response 
(eg, response to an antigen or pathogen) that is 
reversible, not considered to be adverse, and not a 
precursor of lymphomas.261,262,263
Given the weight of evidence from the genetic 
toxicity studies, tofacitinib is not considered a 
genotoxicant.
Reproducible increases in chromosomal 
abnormalities were produced in the human 
lymphocyte in vitro cytogenetic study only at high 
(1700 g/mL) and cytotoxic (48% mitotic 
suppression) concentrations with metabolic 
activation, which is > ~ 46000- or 23000-fold the 
human unbound Cmax at the 5 or 10 mg BID dose.  
Therefore, the positive finding in the in vitro 
cytogenetic assay is not considered relevant due to 
the high concentration that was required to induce 
chromosomal aberrations and the lack of 
chromosomal or DNA damage in vivo.
Leydig Cell Tumours
The benign Leydig cell tumours observed in the rat 
carcinogenicity study are attributed to JAK2 
inhibition of PRL signalling within the Leydig cells 
and creation of the same intracellular environment 
that is caused by dopamine agonists.  This 
mechanism of causing Leydig cell tumours in rats is 
well precedented and is not associated with risk of 
Leydig cell tumours in humans.264

doses, respectively, based on the human unbound 
AUC at the 5 mg BID dose.  The exposure multiples 
for male/female rats were 5/11, 17/42, and 61/94 for 
the low, mid and high doses, respectively, based on 
the human unbound AUC at the 10 mg BID dose.
Relevance to Human Usage
A thorough review of the literature and subsequent 
discussion of the lack of relevance of rat Leydig cell 
tumours to human risk is provided in a Pfizer safety 
assessment.265
Hibernoma
Malignant hibernomas observed in female rats 
treated with tofacitinib are not considered a 
significant risk for human safety at clinical 
exposures.  This is based on a non-genotoxic 
proliferative effect with an adequate safety margin.  
Additionally, the differences in hibernoma incidence, 
malignancy potential, and location between rats and 
humans, and the association of tofacitinib with 
hibernoma in only a single rodent species and sex, 
decrease the likelihood that the hibernomas in rats 
are relevant to humans.
Although the exact mechanism for hibernoma 
development is undefined, several investigative 
studies suggest that JAK inhibition and/or increased 
sympathetic stimulation might contribute to BAT 
proliferation induced by tofacitinib.266
A thorough review of the literature and subsequent 
discussion of the relevance of rat hibernomas to 
human risk is provided.267
Thymoma
The increased incidence of benign thymomas was 
statistically significant only in high dose females and 
not considered a significant risk for humans based on 
the calculated safety margins.  
Thymomas (tumours originating from the epithelial 
cells of the thymus) are rarely observed in Sprague-
Dawley rats.263 268  Thymomas can be induced in 
rodents by viral inoculation,269,270 but it is not known 
whether immunosuppression can cause thymomas in 
rats due to endemic viral infection.  An 
immunosuppressive mechanism is supported by the 
results from rat carcinogenicity studies on the 
immunosuppressant drugs mycophenolate sodium, 
pimecrolimus, and leflunomide.  Thymoma 
incidence was increased in tofacitinib dosed female 
rats for each of these immunosuppressant drugs,
although the increase reached statistical significance 
for both the trend and pairwise tests only for 
pimecrolimus.271,272  Based on data from a large 
registry linkage study, thymoma risk was not 
elevated among 516,000 people with AIDS in the US 
(4 thymoma cases, SIR = 0.85).  Similarly, thymoma 
risk does not seem elevated among 
immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, 
as a literature search revealed no reported cases.273  
Page 38
Table 7. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage

Relevance to Human Usage
In humans, the mechanism for development of 
thymomas is unknown.274  Based on the high 
exposure margin compared to clinical exposure to 
tofacitinib, the risk to humans is low.
Angiomas
An increased incidence of benign angiomas was 
evident only in low-dose males, with no dose-related 
trend, no significant increase in female rats, no 
increase in malignant haemangiosarcomas in either 
male or female rats, and no increase in 
haemangiomas or haemangiosarcomas in male or 
female mice.  Based on these observations, the 
marginally increased incidence of benign angioma in 
low-dose male rats is not considered biologically 
meaningful and not a relevant risk for humans 
treated with tofacitinib.275
Results from rat and rabbit EFD toxicology studies 
are potentially relevant to human usage (see Table 35
for relevance on human usage).
Results from a rat fertility toxicology study are 
potentially relevant to human usage (see Table 35 for 
relevance on human usage).
No effects on male fertility are anticipated based on 
animal data results.
Results from a rat study are potentially relevant to 
human usage (see Table 35 for relevance on human 
usage).
Results from a rat perinatal and postnatal toxicology 
study are potentially relevant to human usage (see 
Table 35 for relevance on human usage).
 Developmental and reproductive (must be 
discussed if medicine might be used in women 
of child-bearing potential)
 Reproductive
In a rat EFD study, maternal toxicity was observed at 
doses 100 mg/kg/day (~ 203- or ~ 101-fold 
multiple based on the human unbound AUC for the 
5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively).  Foetal 
developmental effects consisting of multiple visceral 
and skeletal malformations were observed at the 
100 mg/kg/day dose.  Multiple visceral and skeletal 
malformations were observed in a rabbit EFD study 
at doses 30 mg/kg/day (~ 13- or ~ 6-fold 
multiple based on the human total AUC for the 5 or 
10 mg BID dose, respectively).  However, in rabbits, 
no evidence of maternal toxicity was observed at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (~ 63- or ~ 32-fold 
multiple based on the human total AUC for the 5 or 
10 mg BID dose, respectively).
In a rat fertility study, treatment-related effects on 
female reproduction at doses 10 mg/kg/day (~ 15-
or ~ 8-fold multiple based on the human unbound 
AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively) 
consisted of decreased pregnancy rate; decreases in 
the numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and 
viable foetuses; and an increase in early resorptions.  
No effects on male fertility were observed in this 
study.
Tofacitinib was secreted in milk of lactating rats.

dose), the averages for the total number of delivered 
pups and the number of live born pups were reduced.  
All pups died between days 1-4 postpartum in litters 
delivered from 14 of 21 dams and 16 dams were 
euthanised because of no surviving pups.  Tofacitinib 
reduced live litter weight, litter size, and individual 
pup weights at each weighing on days 1 and 4 
postpartum.  No effect occurred on sexual maturation 
or the ability of the F1 generation rats to learn, mate 
and produce viable F2 generation foetuses.
In studies conducted in juvenile rats and monkeys 
tofacitinib-related effects on immune and 
hematologic parameters were consistent with those 
in adult animals at similar exposures.  There were no 
tofacitinib-related changes in landmarks of sexual 
maturity or fertility indices, nor was there evidence 
of findings associated with impaired bone growth 
and development.

Safety Pharmacology as applicable:
 Cardiovascular system
Tofacitinib (100 M) has no significant effect on 
potassium channels based on results from the hERG 
study at concentrations ~ 890- or ~ 440-fold based 
on the human unbound Cmax for the 5 or 10 mg BID 
dose, respectively.  Tofacitinib had no effect on the 
action potential duration, the resting membrane 
potential, action potential amplitude, and maximal 
velocity of depolarisation based on a study on dog 
Purkinje fibres.  In isolated rat aortas, tofacitinib 
caused a concentration-related relaxation of KCl and 
norepinephrine induced contractions at 1 to 100 M 
(312-31240 ng/mL).  Tofacitinib has no significant 
effect on spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria
In male rats, tofacitinib (100 mg/kg; calculated 
unbound Cmax 7336 ng/mL) caused a drop in mean 
arterial pressure of 37 mmHg, and a heart rate 
increase of approximately 100 beats per minute.  
This dose represents exposure margins of ~ 210- or ~ 
103--fold based on the human unbound Cmax for the 
5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively.  Similar effects 
were observed in a separate study in female rats.
In a telemetry monkey study, an increase in heart 
rate (~ 43% over control) was seen at 2-3 hours post-
dose in animals receiving 300 mg/kg (~ 61- or ~ 30-
fold multiple for the human unbound Cmax for the 
5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively).  The response 
was transient and maximal at 3 hours post-dose.  
There was no effect on blood pressure or 
electrocardiogram.

Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastritis, 
nausea have occurred in patients treated with 
tofacitinib; the relationship of these events to the 
effects of tofacitinib on gastric emptying and GI 
motility in rats is unknown.
Relevance of these clinical pathology changes to 
human usage is not expected based on the high 
exposure multiples at which effects occurred in the 
renal safety pharmacology study.
Relevance to human usage is not expected based on 
the high exposure multiples at which effects occurred

Relevance of the hepatocellular findings to human

No additional human risks were identified in the 
non-clinical juvenile toxicology studies that were not

Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studiesa
 Gastrointestinal:
In rats, oral administration of tofacitinib at 30 
mg/kg (estimated unbound AUC 12,070 ng•h/mL) 
inhibited gastric emptying and reduced the geometric 
centre of distribution of a radioactive marker (~39-
or ~19-fold margin based on the unbound human 
AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively).
 Renal:
In rats dosed with tofacitinib at 100 mg/kg (~ 210- or 
~ 103-fold multiple relative to the unbound human 
Cmax for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively), 
potassium excretion was elevated by 104% with a 
trend of both decreased chloride (77%) and urine 
volume (32%).
 Nervous system:
In mice dosed with tofacitinib at 100 mg/kg (~ 92-
or ~ 45-fold multiple relative to the unbound human 
Cmax for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively), 
dose-related CNS behavioural changes were 
observed.
 Nephrotoxicity and Hepatoxicity
No treatment-related nephrotoxicity or 
hepatotoxicity findings were observed in repeat-dose 
monkey studies.  No nephrotoxicity findings were 
observed in repeat-dose rat studies.
In rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, tofacitinib-related non-
adverse hepatic findings of increased liver weight 
and hepatocellular hypertrophy with or without liver 
function transaminase elevations with no evidence of 
hepatocellular degeneration were observed at ~ 
119/189-fold or ~ 59/95-fold multiples for 
male/female based on the human unbound AUC for 
the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively) and monkey

unbound AUC at the 5 or 10 mg BID dose) in the 
juvenile rat fertility study, there was no evidence of 
developmental toxicity (sexual landmarks) or 
reproductive toxicity (mating and fertility) following 
the juvenile treatment period.
In the 1-month study in juvenile rats (at PND 21-50; 
comparable to a 2 year-old human) and 39-week 
study in juvenile monkeys (at 13-14-months; 
comparable to ~5-year old human), tofacitinib-

related effects on immune and haematology 
parameters at all doses in rats ( 1 mg/kg/day; ~ 
0.4/1-fold or ~ 0.2/0.6-fold multiple for male/female 
based on the human unbound AUC at the 5 or 10 mg 
BID dose, respectively) and monkeys (2 
mg/kg/day; ~ 1.1 or ~ 0.6-fold multiple based on 
the human unbound AUC for the 5 or 10 mg BID 
dose, respectively), which were consistent with 
JAK1/3 and JAK2 inhibition; these effects were 
generally reversible during the recovery phase of 
each study.
In addition, lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia and 
lymphoma was not observed in the 39-week juvenile 
monkey study up to doses of 10 mg/kg/day (~ 6- or ~ 
3-fold multiple based on the human unbound AUC 
for the 5 or 10 mg BID dose, respectively).
In a juvenile rat toxicity study conducted to evaluate 
bone effects, administration of tofacitinib to juvenile 
rats beginning at PND 7 or 21 until PND 49 resulted 
in no direct tofacitinib-related bone findings at doses 
up to 20 mg/kg/day (≥29-fold or ≥15-fold multiple 
based on the human total AUC for the 5 or 10 mg 
BID dose, respectively).  
 Mechanisms for Drug interactions
Tofacitinib did not significantly inhibit the major 
drug-metabolising CYP450 (IC50s >30μM) or UGT; 
(IC50s >100μM) enzymes in vitro, indicating a low 
potential for drug interactions with compounds 
metabolised by these isoforms. The in vitro potential 
of tofacitinib to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or 
CYP2B6 was low based on mRNA changes in 
hepatocyte studies. Tofacitinib is a substrate for P-
gp, but is not a substrate for the BCRP, OCT1 or 
OCT2, or OATP1B1 or 1B3. Tofacitinib is not an 
inhibitor of OATP1B3 and showed weak inhibitory 
properties against P-gp (IC50 311μM), OATP1B1 
(IC50 55μM), and OCT2 (IC50 150μM), indicating a 
low risk of clinical interactions with these 
transporters.
 Other toxicity-related information or data
Tofacitinib was negative for contact sensitisation in a 
LLNA and was not considered an ocular or primary 
skin irritant in rabbits.  There was no evidence of 
haemolysis observed in an in vitro haemolysis 
compatibility study conducted with an IV 
formulation of tofacitinib.  There was no evidence 
that tofacitinib was phototoxic in the 3T3- NRU 
assay or in the in vivo phototoxicity study in 
pigmented rats.

Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
Cumulatively through 28 February 2023, it is estimated that 23,702 subjects have 
participated in the tofacitinib (immediate-release and prolonged-release) clinical 
development programme: 17,902  subjects were exposed to tofacitinib; 5431 subjects 
received tofacitinib in combination with other study medication with/without placebo; 78 
subjects received blinded therapy; 1663 received  placebo; and 3074 subjects received 
comparator drugs with/without placebo.  Of note, some subjects may have been randomised 
to more than 1 treatment group.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Prolonged-release:
The clinical trial programme to support tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release (PR) tablets
included 7 completed Phase I studies in healthy volunteers, a completed local Japanese Phase 
3 study in RA patients (A3921215), and a completed global Phase 3b/4 study in RA patients 
(A3921192).  In the completed study A3921215, 104 subjects were treated with tofacitinib 
PR 11 mg once daily (QD) and 105 subjects received tofacitinib immediate-release 5 mg 
BID.  In study A3921192, all subjects received tofacitinib PR 11 mg QD. The demographic 
characteristics of the subjects treated with tofacitinib PR 11 mg QD from studies A3921215 
and A3921192 are provided below.

The following clinical trial exposure data provided below for RA is applicable for the PR and 
immediate-release tablets.
Prolonged-release and Immediate-release:
The tofacitinib immediate-release BID RA development programme includes 2 completed 
Phase 2 studies, 10 completed Phase 2 studies, 6 completed Phase 3 studies, 2 completed 
long-term extension (LTE) studies, and 1 completed Phase 3b/4 study. As mentioned above, 
the PR RA studies include A3921215, a local Japanese Phase 3 study in RA patients, and 
A3921192, a global Phase 3b/4 study in RA patients.
The clinical trial exposure information from the RA studies for the Phase 1, 2, 3, and LTE 
(P123LTE) studies (includes immediate-release and PR studies) and for the Phase 2, 3, 4 
(P234) Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) studies is presented below. There were 7964
adult patients exposed to tofacitinib PR and immediate-release totalling 23,497 patient-years 
of exposure to tofacitinib. Data from study A3921133 was excluded from the exposure 
tables presented in the P123LTE studies.  
Study A3921133 was a Phase 3b/4 randomized, parallel-arm, open-label, safety endpoint 
study evaluating the safety of tofacitinib at 2 doses (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) versus TNFi 
(adalimumab 40 mg every other week by SC injection in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada, or 
etanercept 50 mg once weekly by SC injection in all other countries).  Subjects ≥50 years of 
age or older, with moderately or severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX
and who had at least one CV risk factor (eg, current smoker, high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, history of heart attack, family history of coronary heart 
Page 44
disease, extra articular RA disease), were enrolled in this study.  The co-primary endpoints of 
Study A3921133 were adjudicated MACE and adjudicated malignancies excluding NMSC.
In Study A3921133, 2911 adults were exposed to tofacitinib totaling 9846.9 patient-years of 
exposure: 1455 adults and 5073.5 patient-years in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group; 1456 
adults and 4773.4 patient-years in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group.  In the TNFi group, 1451 
adults were exposed, totaling 4940.7 patient-years of exposure.    
The following tables depict total exposure to tofacitinib based on clinical trial experience by 
duration and dose for patients treated in the Phase P123LTE studies (All RA population), 
either as monotherapy or on background DMARD therapy.  Adalimumab was used as an 
active control in 3 studies, the Phase 2 Study A3921035 (as adalimumab monotherapy) the 
Phase 3 Study A3921064 (adalimumab with background MTX), and the Phase 3b/4 Study 
A3921187 (adalimumab with background MTX).  MTX was used as an active control in 1 
study, the Phase 3 Study A3921069, where tofacitinib was administered as monotherapy.
Clinical trial exposure to tofacitinib in the RA development programme is summarised in
Table 9 to Table 13.  Since subjects were allowed to switch doses between 5 mg BID and 
10 mg BID during the LTE studies, the Average Daily Dose (AVDOS) was used to 
determine the dose group.  That is, if the AVDOS is 15 mg daily, subjects are assigned to 
the 10 mg BID group, whereas if the AVDOS is less than 15 mg daily, subjects are assigned 
to the 5 mg BID group.

Psoriatic Arthritis
No studies have been conducted using the tofacitinib PR formulation in PsA patients.  
The PsA database includes data from 2 completed Phase 3 studies (A3921125 and 
A3921091) and a completed LTE study (A3921092).  For the All PsA cohort (Phase 3 
randomized controlled clinical studies and LTE study [P3LTE]), the number of subjects and 
PY of exposure are shown in Table 15.  For tofacitinib average 5 mg BID and average 10 mg 
BID, 458 and 325 subjects and a median duration of treatment 1176 and 1024 days, 
respectively, contributed to a total of 2038.0 PY of exposure for the all tofacitinib group 
(Table 15).  Table 16 provides exposure by age > or 65, and by gender. Table 17 provides

Ulcerative Colitis
The UC data includes a total of 1240 subjects with moderate-to-severe UC who received at 
least 1 dose of placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, or tofacitinib 10 mg BID.  Among these 
subjects, 1157 subjects received at least 1 dose of tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg BID with 2814.4 
PY of drug exposure as of 24 August 2020.  A total of 83 subjects received only placebo.  
Duration of tofacitinib treatment by dose from Phase 2, Phase 3, long-term extension 
(P2P3LTE) UC studies is shown in Table 19.  Clinical trial exposures by age group and 
gender, by race, and by category of renal impairment are shown in Table 20, Table 21, and 
Table 22, respectively.
In Table 19, data are presented by predominant dose groups.  Since tofacitinib was 
administered as either 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID, subjects categorized to the predominant dose 
5 mg BID group are subjects who received tofacitinib 5 mg BID during most of their 
treatment duration.  Similarly, subjects categorized to the predominant dose 10 mg BID 
group are subjects who received tofacitinib 10 mg BID during most of their treatment 
duration.

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA and Juvenile PsA)
The JIA clinical development program was designed to evaluate 2 formulations of 
tofacitinib: oral immediate release tablet (5 mg BID) and tofacitinib oral solution (1 mg/mL, 
weight-based dosed, BID), for subjects with a body weight <40 kg to achieve comparable 
AUC for the treatment of subjects with JIA, age 2 years to <18 years.  The studies included a 
completed Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) Study A3921103 in subjects with JIA, a completed 
Phase 3 pivotal Study A3921104, and an on-going LTE Study A3921145 for subjects with 
JIA who previously participated in Studies A3921103 and A3921104.  The available safety 
data from Study A3921145 interim data cut of 04 June 2019 are included.  All subjects that 
received at least 1 dose of tofacitinib in any of the 3 studies (A3921103, A3921104, and 
A3921145) are included in the Integrated Safety Analysis Population (ISAP).
In the integrated safety dataset, a total of 251 JIA subjects (65 male and 186 female) from 2 
to <18 years of age were treated with 2 to 5 mg BID doses (based on weight) of tofacitinib 
5 mg BID with or without concomitant MTX.  All subjects received at least 1 dose of 
tofacitinib in any of the 3 studies (ISAP) giving an overall exposure of 351 PY and the mean 
duration of exposure as 511 days (median duration 485 days).

Ankylosing Spondylitis
No studies have been conducted using the tofacitinib PR formulation in AS patients.  What 
follows is the AS clinical development programme for the immediate-release tablets.
The AS clinical development programme includes a completed Phase 2 dose-ranging study 
(A3921119) and a completed Phase 3 study (A3921120).  In the Phase 2 study (A3921119), 
immediate-release tofacitinib was evaluated at doses of 2, 5, and 10 mg BID.  In the Phase 3 
study (A3921120) immediate-release tofacitinib was evaluated at 5 mg BID.  Both 
A3921119 and A3921120 were randomised, placebo-controlled studies; the AS clinical 
development programme did not include LTE studies.
Throughout the RMP, “RCTs” (placebo-controlled cohort) refers to the “Tofa 5 mg BID” 
group, based on the integrated pooled data in A3921119 and A3921120 for up to 16 weeks.  
“All AS” (All Tofa cohort) refers to the integrated pooled data (using the 48-week final data), 
including the separate data for the “All Tofa 5 mg BID” group and “All Tofa” group (the 
“All Tofa” group includes patients exposed to 5 mg BID but also patients from study 
A3921119 who were exposed to 2 mg BID and to 10 mg BID).  Please see the following 
tables for the tofacitinib treatment duration by dose groups (Table 30) as well as clinical trial 
exposures by age group and gender (Table 31), by race (Table 32), and by category of renal 
impairment (Table 33) in the AS clinical development programme.

Exposure duration in days = date of last dose - date of first dose +1. Any missed doses between subject's first 
dose and last dose are counted as dosed.  The durations of exposure are standardized to subject-years by 
dividing the sum of exposure times in days by 365.25.  One month is equivalent to 28 days.
For subjects randomised to Placebo Tofa 5 mg BID in All Tofa cohort, the date of first dose refers to the 
date of first dose of tofacitinib treatment.

significantly higher 
tofacitinib exposure than 
patients with normal renal 
function or patients with 
mild or moderate renal 
impairment.  Patients were 
randomised to tofacitinib

activity.
Drugs with 
immunosuppressive activity 
may have the potential to 
affect host defences against 
malignancies, and the 
adequacy of previous 
treatment can be difficult to 
determine.  Thus, exclusion 
of patients with known 
previous malignancy was 
prudent while data were 
generated on the incidence
and type of malignancies 
observed in patients treated 
with tofacitinib.
This exclusion criterion was 
applied to tofacitinib 
clinical studies to protect 
subject safety, while noting 
the accuracy of historical 
information on the risk of 
GI perforation is often 
incomplete.

SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes
While some rare events may still require more clinical trial exposure than that accrued to-
date for tofacitinib, the clinical trial exposure to-date is sufficient for many rare events to 
have been observed.  The sponsor is conducting long-term safety clinical trials to study 
prolonged exposure.  Rates of events with long latency, such as malignancy and 
cardiovascular events are within the ranges reported for other RA therapies.  As these events 
are not common, continued monitoring is appropriate. The sponsor is conducting a long-term 
active controlled safety trial.

Patients with a history of malignancy except for adequately treated or excised 
non-metastatic basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ 
were excluded from the tofacitinib clinical studies.  
In addition, patients with a history of lymphoproliferative disorder or signs or

The indication for tofacitinib, in combination with MTX, is for moderate to severe 
active RA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are 
intolerant to one or more DMARDs.  Patients with moderate to severe active RA 
were enrolled in the RA clinical trials.  Tofacitinib has also been studied in 
healthy volunteers.
The indication for PsA for tofacitinib, in combination with MTX, is the treatment 
of active PsA in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have 
been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy.  Subjects enrolled in the PsA clinical 
trials must have had 3 tender/painful joints and 3 swollen joints and must have 
had active plaque psoriasis at screening.
The indication for UC is the treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were 
intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.  Patients with 
moderately to severely active UC were enrolled in the UC induction studies, and 
patients with clinical response (including patients in remission) were enrolled in 
the maintenance study.  There is no information on induction treatment of patients 
with mild to moderate UC with tofacitinib.
Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (RF+ or RF- polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis), and juvenile PsA 
in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to 
conventional therapy with DMARDs.  In the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies, subjects 
with polyarticular course JIA or PsA/enthesitis-related arthritis must have had a 
minimum of 5 and 3 active joints, respectively, at screening and baseline to be 
eligible for study entry.
The indication for AS is the treatment of adult patients with active AS who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy.  In clinical trials with immediate-
release tablets, active AS was defined as Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease 
Activity Index (BASDAI) score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) 
of ≥4.

Exposure
In the tofacitinib development programme, there was evidence to suggest that 
there was an increased risk of HZ in Asian patients (specifically, in Japanese and 
Korean patients).  A numerically higher IR of ILD was also observed in Asian RA 
patients as compared to the risk reported in RA patients of other races. There were
2070 Asian patients (4914.81 person-time [years]) enrolled in the P123LTE 
studies in the All RA population.  As of 31 July 2019, 38 Asian patients (59.7
person-time [years]) enrolled in the P3LTE studies in the All PsA population.  As 
of 24 August 2020, 144 Asian patients (363.81 person-time [years]) enrolled in 
the P2P3LTE studies in the All UC population.  As of the final 10 September 
2020 data-cut, 85 Asian patients (47.15 person-time [years]) participated in the 
AS immediate-release tablets clinical programme.
The clearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic 
metabolism and 30% renal elimination of parent drug.  The hepatic metabolism is 
primarily via CYP3A4 (approximately 53%) with a minor contribution from 
CYP2C19 (approximately 17%).  Genotypic analysis was done for the *2, *3, *4, 
*5, and *17 alleles of the CYP2C19 gene based on data from a healthy volunteer 
study.  Sixty (60) subjects were classified as either PMs: carriers of 
CYP2C19*2/*2, CYP2C19*2/*3 or CYP2C19*3/*3 alleles, UMs: 
CYP2C19*17/*17 alleles or EMs: all other alleles.  The mean Cmax and AUC(0-)
values in the PMs were approximately 15% and 17% greater, respectively, than 
those in the EMs indicating that genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 are unlikely 
to result in clinically relevant increases in the systemic exposure of tofacitinib.
Children and adolescents below the age of 18 years were included in the clinical 
programme for JIA.  As of June 2019, 251 paediatric patients with JIA were 
exposed to tofacitinib in the completed and on-going JIA studies in the integrated 
safety analysis population.  
The safety and benefits of tofacitinib in children or adolescents have not yet been 
established in patients less than 2 years of age.
As of 18 January 2019, 1270 RA patients enrolled in the P123LTE studies in the 
All RA population were 65 years of age or older.  In the PsA programme, as of 31 
July 2019, there were 72 patients enrolled who were 65 years of age or older.  As 
of 24 August 2020, out of 1157 subjects who received at least 1 dose of tofacitinib 
5 mg BID or 10 mg BID in the UC programme, 77 subjects (6.7%) were 65 years 
of age or older.  As of the final 10 September 2020 data-cut, 13 elderly subjects 
had participated in the AS immediate-release tablets clinical programme.
AS = ankylosing spondylitis; AUC = area under the concentration-time curve; BID = twice daily; Cmax = peak plasma

SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
V.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The cumulative worldwide exposure to tofacitinib since product approval is estimated to be 
720,826 patient-years.  
The worldwide estimate is based on audited unit sales (SUs) of tofacitinib from IQVIA 
Health’s Database.  The data were extrapolated for fourth quarter of 2022 by taking the 
average of previous 4 quarters and pro-rated to the end of the current reporting period.  The 
average daily dose (AVDOS) is as follows:


the AVDOS of 2 units daily for the 5 mg and 10 mg tablets; and the 1 mg/1 mL oral 
solution
the AVDOS of 1 unit daily for the 11 mg and 22 mg prolonged-release tablets
The cumulative exposure number was calculated by adding up the individual patient-years 
based on product formulation.  The AVDOS was used to convert SUs into patient-days (days 
of therapy) and further divided by 365.25 (days in a year) to obtain patient-years.  Allocation 
of the patient population by indication, gender, age, and dose is derived through prescription 
share calculations from IQVIA Health’s Prescriber Insights database.  Patient-years exposure 
by region is based on SU sales by country from the database.
Please note the following are important considerations when utilising data from the IQVIA
Health database.  Tofacitinib, like other RA therapies, is often sold into specialty pharmacies, 
which are not captured in the MIDAS audit for most markets outside of the US.  This can 
often lead to significant under-reporting of units sold or in some markets, no reporting at all. 
The unit data from MIDAS audit reflect units sold to a distributor, but this does not 
necessarily mean the drug was prescribed to or taken by a patient.  In addition, the IQVIA
Health Prescriber Insights medical and prescription data used for this analysis are not 
available in all markets.  Data from markets where the data is available are extrapolated 
across all markets where tofacitinib is sold.  Lastly, the patient-years metric is rounded and 
does not represent unique patient counts. 
Cumulative (from the international birth date) estimated exposure by indication, region, and 
dose based on data provided by IQVIA Health Prescribing Insights Medical from 06 
November 2012 through the third quarter of 2022 and extrapolated to the end of the reporting 
interval (estimated region breakdown based on Pfizer internal sales data) is summarised in
Table 36.
Table 37 shows the splits for age for United States and Puerto Rico and rest of world for the 
cumulative exposure (from the international birth date to 28 February 2023).
Beginning with the release of 1Q22 data, IQVIA medical data moved from NDTI (National 
Disease and Therapeutic Index, used to capture data in the US) to NMTA (National Medical 
and Treatment Audit), used to capture data in the US and Puerto Rico.  NMTA uses different 
Page 74
methodologies for data, sample and projection compared to NDTI.  This change impacts 
cumulative data.  Due to the change in methodology, the MAH observed a trend break in data 
for indication, formulation, region, gender, age and dose.  As part of this update, the NMTA 
audit can only produce patient age information in 5 year age bands due to data privacy 
concerns for older age groups.  The 5 year age bands do not align with the age breakdown for 
paediatric population according to ICH E11 (R1) recommendation. In this report, the 
demographic data for the paediatric population are presented according to ICH 
recommendation (0-16 years) for all countries except US and Puerto Rico; the demographic 
data for US and Puerto Rico are presented according to 5 years bands mimicking as close as 
possible ICH recommendation for the paediatric population (0-15; 16-20 years).  There is no 
impact on elderly population aged >65 years.
For comparison purposes, using the new methodology, the tables were re-run for the previous 
reporting period (from the international birth date to 06 November 2021) (see Table 38 and 
Table 39).

Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
SVI.1. Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
Given the mechanism of action of tofacitinib and the lack of reported pleasurable effects on 
the central nervous system, physiological or psychological dependency and resulting misuse 
for illegal purposes are not expected to occur with this medicinal product.  Tofacitinib has no 
known attributes that make it attractive for intentional overdose or illegal use.  Cumulatively 
through 28 February 2023, there were no spontaneous reports in the safety database 
indicative of misuse for illegal purposes with tofacitinib.

SVII.3. Details of Important Identified, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
The important identified risks for all formulations discussed include venous 
thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]/pulmonary embolism [PE]); serious and 
other important infections; herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation; lung cancer; lymphoma; 
myocardial infarction; decrease in haemoglobin (Hgb) levels and anaemia; non-melanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC); transaminase elevation and potential for drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI); and higher incidence and severity of AEs in the elderly (please note, not applicable 
for JIA).  
The important potential risks for all formulations include malignancy; cardiovascular risk 
(excl MI); gastrointestinal perforation, interstitial lung disease (ILD), progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML); all-cause mortality; fractures; increased risk of AEs when 
tofacitinib is administered in combination with MTX in RA or PsA patients; and primary 
viral infection following live vaccination.
Missing information for all formulations include effects on pregnancy and the foetus, use in 
breastfeeding, effect on vaccination efficacy and the use of live/attenuated vaccines, use in 
patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, use in patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment, use in patients with evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, 
use in patients with malignancy. and long-term safety in pJIA patients and juvenile PsA 
patients (e.g., growth or development disturbances).
For the RA clinical development programme, data from the P234 RCTs (immediate-release)
and the All RA populations (P123LTE, immediate-release and PR) is final as of 18 January 
2019 (this excludes study A3921133).  The clinical trial information for the PR formulation
(including studies A3921215 and A3921192) provides data from relatively small populations 
over a short time period (12 and 48 weeks, respectively).  Neither study is controlled with 
respect to tofacitinib (i.e., neither placebo-controlled nor active comparator controlled. 
Page 80
Please see Annex 7 for safety information from these studies.  Data from these studies is 
incorporated into P123LTE. 
For the PsA clinical development programme, the data from the P3 (randomised controlled 
trials, RCTs) and All PsA populations is final as of 31 July 2019.  RCTs (Phase 3 studies) 
included A3921125 and A3921091.  All PsA (P3LTE studies) included A3921125, 
A3921091, and the LTE study A3921092. Data from the double-blind placebo-controlled 
clinical trial A3921234, conducted in China, is excluded.
For the UC clinical development programme, all P2P3 induction and P3 maintenance studies 
have been completed.  The 24 August 2020 final data is provided for the All UC P2P3LTE 
population.  RCTs (P2P3 induction studies) included A3921063, a Phase 2 study, and 
A3921094 and A3921095, Phase 3 studies.  For adjudicated endpoints, incidence rates are 
based on data from Phase 3 studies, because data from A3921063 was not adjudicated.  The 
P2P3 induction studies included 10 mg BID but did not include 5 mg BID.  RCTs (Phase 3 
maintenance study) included only A3921096.  The All UC data (P2P3LTE) studies included 
A3921063, A3921094, A3921095, A3921096, and A3921139.
The JIA clinical development programme integrated safety dataset includes a completed 
Phase 1 PK study (A3921103), a completed Phase 3 study (A3921104), and an on-going LTE 
study (A3921145), for which the data cut-off date was 04 June 2019.
For the AS clinical development programme, RCTs (placebo-controlled cohort: “Tofa 5 mg 
BID” group) All AS (All Tofa cohort: “All Tofa 5 mg BID” and “All Tofa” groups) datasets 
are final as of 10 September 2020.  RCTs (placebo-controlled cohort: “Tofa 5 mg BID” 
group) is based on the integrated pooled data in A3921119 and A3921120 for up to 16 
weeks.  All AS (“All Tofa 5 mg BID” and “All Tofa” groups) is based on the integrated 
pooled data using the 48-week dataset (final data), where separate data are available for the 
“All Tofa 5 mg BID” group and the “All Tofa” group, which includes not only the patients 
exposed to 5 mg BID but also the A3921119 patients exposed to 2 mg BID and to 10 mg 
BID.
For the clinical development programmes, for both RCT and All Tofa Cohort, incidence rate 
(IR) estimates and the corresponding number (%) of subjects with an event are calculated by 
inclusion of events occurring up to 28 days beyond the last dose.  Exposure (as PY) is 
defined as the total follow up time calculated up to the day of the first event within the event 
counting period for subjects with the event or the last dose day plus a risk period of up to 28 
days beyond the last dose for subjects without events.  These definitions were chosen 
because reporting to the company safety database may occur at any time regardless of the 
time elapsed from the last administration of study drug or since study completion.  Inclusion 
of all events without regard to elapsed time may inflate IR estimations as the exposure time 
(denominator) is not similarly increased.
The safety cut-off date for the post-marketing database update was 05 November 2021.
Following the conclusion of the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205 study, the results were 
incorporated under the safety concerns in the RMP that were addressed in the study: VTE 
Page 81
(DVT/PE), serious infections events, HZ, NMSC, malignancy, lung cancer, lymphoma,
MACE, myocardial infarction, GI perforation, PML, all-cause mortality, increased risk of 
AEs when tofacitinib is administered in combination with MTX in RA patients, and higher 
incidence and severity of AEs in the elderly.   
A datacut of 31 March 2018 was a priori specified as the cut point for events with risk during 
or very proximate to exposure (acute risk events).  The study was extended to use a datacut 
of 31 January 2019, which was used for longer latency events (referred to throughout as 
“latent events”) (malignancies, NMSC, and death for which risk may continue after 
discontinuation), to allow for a larger number of events to accrue.  
In this study, the full sample cohorts included All RA patients, 18 years of age and older, 
who initiated tofacitinib or bDMARD.  Subpopulation analyses included patients with 
moderate-to-severe disease severity and patients with moderate-to-severe disease, age ≥50, 
with at least one CV risk factor.  
The final results from Study A3921133, a prospective, randomised, open-label study in adult 
patients with moderate to severe RA evaluating the safety of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID compared to a TNFi, are included for safety events of interest.  The IR 
estimates and the corresponding number (%) of subjects with an event are calculated by 
inclusion of events occurring up to 28 days beyond the last dose unless otherwise noted.  PY 
exposure is defined as the total follow up time calculated up to the day of the first event, 
subject to a risk period of up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the last contact date.  For 
MACE and its components, a risk period of 60 days beyond the last dose (the primary 
censoring time) was also used, where noted.  For malignancies excluding NMSC and its 
subtypes, a risk period of total time (the primary censoring time) was also used, where noted.

Interventional Clinical Trials:
RA: In controlled studies (excluding A3921133), the rate of PE over 0-3 months in the 5 mg 
twice daily and 10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups was 0.00 and 0.00 patients with events 
per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 0.40 patients with events per 100 patient-
years in the placebo group.  The rate for DVT over 0-3 months the 5 mg twice daily and 10 
Page 82
mg twice daily tofacitinib groups was 0.00 and 0.21 patients with events per 100 patient-
years, respectively, compared to 0.40 patients with events per 100 patient-years in the 
placebo group.
In randomised studies of 6-, 12-, or 24-month duration (excluding A3921133), the rate of PE 
in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups was 0.12 and 0.15 patients 
with events per 100 patient-years, respectively.  The rate of DVT in the 5 mg twice daily and 
10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups was 0.15 and 0.10 patients with events per 100 patient-
years, respectively.
In the long-term safety all exposure population (integrated completed Phase 1, 2, 3 and LTE 
studies excluding A3921133), the rate of PE in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily 
tofacitinib groups was 0.12 and 0.13 patients with events per 100 patient-years, respectively.  
The rate of DVT in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups was 0.17 
and 0.15 patients with events per 100 patient-years, respectively.
A3921133 final data: The IRs per 100 PY (95% CI) of adjudicated PE the tofacitinib 5 mg

AS: Not applicable.
VII.3.1.1.1.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Venous thromboembolism was observed at an increased and dose-dependent incidence in 
patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors in Study A3921133 (patients 
with RA aged 50 years and older with at least one CV risk factor).  No differential risk 
factors were identified for the increased risk relative to TNF inhibitors.
Numerous VTE risk factors are known in the general population. These known VTE risk 
factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, 
myocardial infarction (within previous 3 months), heart failure, use of combined hormonal 
contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, inherited coagulation disorder, malignancy. 
Additional VTE risk factors such as age, obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30), diabetes, 
hypertension, smoking status should also be considered.
Pediatric JIA patients can experience many of the risk factors seen in adults. In a review 
article it is noted that in children aged 2 to <18 years with JIA, cardiovascular risk factors 
including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and being less physically active are more frequent 
than in their healthy peers.  JIA patients may also have other cardiovascular risk factors seen 
in adult RA such as obesity, diabetes, and smoking. JIA patients potentially could have other 
risk factors (e.g., adolescent contraceptive hormone use, major surgeries, immobilization, 
congenital and acquired thrombophilias),276 which may increase their risk of such events. 
Published literature277 278 279 suggest a higher prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies 
positive, or elevated levels of coagulation factors in JIA patients compared with non-JIA 
patients; however, these findings were not correlated with clinical features such as abnormal 
clotting test or anticardiolipin antibody syndrome.  Data also suggest an increased risk of 
malignancy among JIA patients compared with non-JIA patients. In a retrospective cohort 
Page 87
study based in the Swedish Cancer Register, the HR (95% CI) for all pediatric malignancies 
in JIA vs the general population was 1.43 (0.71-2.88).280  
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The overall number of 
VTE events in the tofacitinib group with moderate-to-severe disease was small and the rate 
[0.18 (0.04, 0.51)] was similar to the bDMARD group [0.32 (0.20, 0.47)].  The risk factors 
associated with VTE were generally similar between tofacitinib and bDMARD groups and 
were consistent with the known risk factors for VTE (e.g., advanced age).  In patients with 
moderate-to-severe disease aged 50 years and older with at least one CV risk factor, the 
crude incidence rate (95% CI) was 0.22 (0.03, 0.78) in tofacitinib initiators compared with 
0.51 (0.31, 0.80) for bDMARDs initiators.
VII.3.1.1.1.5. Preventability
Caution should be used in patients with risk factors for venous thromboembolism.  
Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for maintenance treatment is not recommended in patients with 
UC who have known VTE, MACE and malignancy risk factors, unless there is no suitable 
alternative treatment available. For patients with RA with known risk factors for VTE, 
consider testing D-dimer levels after approximately 12 months of treatment. If D-dimer test 
result is ≥2 × ULN, confirm that clinical benefits outweigh risks prior to a decision on 
treatment continuation with tofacitinib.  Patients with signs and symptoms of venous 
thromboembolism should be urgently evaluated and tofacitinib should be discontinued in 
patients with suspected venous thromboembolism, regardless of dose or indication.  Please 
see Section V.2 for the proposed additional risk minimisation measures for venous 
thromboembolism (DVT/PE).
VII.3.1.1.1.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib as described in the prescribing information 
where there is an approved indication and the list of routine and additional risk mitigation 
measures that are being proposed to manage the risk of venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE), 
given the determination that venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) is an important identified 
risk, the benefit:risk balance for tofacitinib in treating patients with RA, PsA, UC, pJIA or 
juvenile PsA, and AS at the recommended doses remains favourable.
VII.3.1.1.1.7. Public health impact
Venous thromboembolism, comprised of DVT and PE, represents a global health concern.  
Up to 20% of patients with PE die from the event or shortly after.  Other sequelae of PE can 
include pulmonary hypertension.  With approximately 10 million cases occurring every year 
globally, it is the third leading vascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke.281  In 
2007 it was reported that there were approximately 500,000 DVTs and 300,000 PEs every 
year across 6 European countries with a combined population of more than 300 million 
inhabitants.282  Estimated incidence of pediatric VTE has ranged from 0.07 to 0.49 per 
10,000 children.283   In a UK study,284 the incidence rates of venous thromboembolism in RA 
patients without DMARD and with DMARD per 10,000 person-years were 74.52 and 79.08, 
respectively.  In the same study, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) of venous 
thromboembolism in RA patients without DMARD and with DMARD were 1.29 (1.18, 1.39) 
and 1.35 (1.27, 1.44), respectively.  In a retrospective cohort study based in the German 
Page 88
BIKER registry, 3 thrombosis events were reported in patients with nonsystemic JIA exposed 
to biologics (including 2 DVT and 1 thrombophlebitis event) for a frequency of 0.04 
thrombosis events per 100 PY.285  The tofacitinib post-marketing dataset contained 235 
venous thromboembolism events out of a total of 67,075 cases (reporting proportion of 
0.35%) with an estimated cumulative worldwide post-authorisation exposure to tofacitinib of 
209,081 patient-years (estimated reporting rate of 0.11 per 100 patient-years), as of 05 May 
2019.  Given the background risk and the severity of most of the events, the risk of venous 
thromboembolism (DVT/PE) associated with tofacitinib is not expected to have a significant 
public health impact.  
VII.3.1.1.2. Serious and Other Important Infections
VII.3.1.1.2.1. Potential mechanisms
The mechanism by which infection risk is increased in patients is likely to be multifactorial.  
In addition to the underlying disease, therapies used to treat the disease have effects on the 
immune system.  For example, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors may affect host 
defence against infection since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune 
response.  Tofacitinib inhibits cytokines that are integral to lymphocyte activation, 
proliferation, and function, and inhibition of their signalling may thus result in modulation of 
multiple aspects of the immune response.
VII.3.1.1.2.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
Clinical trial data and post-marketing data.
VII.3.1.1.2.3. Characterisation of the risk
Frequency
Interventional Clinical Trials:
RA: The highest number of AEs reported for patients receiving tofacitinib in the RA 
development programmes was from those coding to the Infections and infestations system 
organ class; the most common infections were respiratory tract infections.

a.
In February 2013 an external, independent committee of infectious disease experts (Opportunistic Infection Review 
Committee [OIRC]) began reviewing and classifying all serious infection events and all events of possible OIs occurring 
in the tofacitinib development programme for RA.
b. Data for OI in RA are a mixture of events identified as OI by the Sponsor (prior to establishment of the OIRC) and 
those assessed as OI by the committee based on the criteria defined in their charter.  In addition to the committee 
assessment, a more detailed and extensive follow-up on individual cases has resulted in additional information available 
for most potential OI events since February 2013.  Cases of herpes zoster that were assessed by the OIRC as involving 2 
adjacent dermatomes are not included in analyses of OI.
Events are counted up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the data cutoff date.  Incidence rate (number of subjects with 
events per 100 subject-years).  Exact Poisson (adjusted for patient-year) 95% confidence intervals are provided for the 
crude incidence rate.  The treatments represent the initial randomised study drug.  Overall includes all patients who start 
on any tofacitinib dose as well as patients who switch from placebo/adalimumab to tofacitinib.  
Includes protocols A3921019, A3921024, A3921025, A3921032, A3921035, A3921039, A3921040, A3921041,

Considering that the risk of TB varies considerably by geographic region based on endemic 
infection rates, the IRs of TB were evaluated by background IR in each country.  The 
countries were grouped into 3 categories (low, intermediate, high) based on World Health 
Organisation (WHO) categorisation.286  In the All RA population, the IRs (95% CI) per 100 
PY of TB by these WHO categories were 0.00 (0.00, 0.04), 0.11 (0.05, 0.21), and 0.51 (0.34, 
0.73) for low, intermediate, and high background incidence groups, respectively.

PY (subject-year): Total follow up time calculated up to the day of the first event, subject to a risk period of 
up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the last contact date.
The last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, 
Telephone Contact Date).  If a subject died, last contact date was the death date.  First events were counted 
within the risk period.  If a subject did not have an event or had an event but outside the risk period, the 
subject was censored at the end of risk period.
For subjects randomized to the TNFi group, adalimumab was administered in US, Puerto Rico, and Canada, 
and etanercept was administered in the rest of the world.

In February 2013 an external, independent committee of infectious disease experts (Opportunistic 
Infection Review Committee [OIRC]) began reviewing and classifying all serious infection events and all 
events of possible OIs occurring in the tofacitinib development programme for RA.  All corresponding 
events in the development programme for PsA have been reviewed by the OIRC.
b. Data for OI in RA are a mixture of events identified as OI by the Sponsor (prior to establishment of the 
OIRC) and those assessed as OI by the committee based on the criteria defined in their charter.  In addition to 
the committee assessment, a more detailed and extensive follow-up on individual cases has resulted in 
additional information available for most potential OI events since February 2013.  Cases of herpes zoster 
that were assessed by the OIRC as involving 2 adjacent dermatomes are not included in analyses of OI.  All 
corresponding events in the development programme for PsA have been reviewed by the OIRC.
CI = confidence interval. PY (subject-year): Total follow up time calculated up to the day of the first event, 
subject to a risk period of 28 days beyond the last dose or to the data cutoff date. Gaps in dosing between 
treatment switches or between the qualifying and LTE studies are included up to 28 days or to the data cutoff 
date. Events are counted up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the data cutoff date.
IR = incidence rate (Number of subjects with events per 100 subject-years).
Exact Poisson (adjusted for Pt-yr) 95% confidence intervals are provided for the crude incidence rate.
Average Tofa 5 mg: Subjects with an average total daily dose of <15 mg from Day 1 on Tofa
Average Tofa 10mg: Subjects with an average total daily dose of 15 mg from Day 1 on Tofa
RCT: includes all the data from protocols A3921091 and A3921125 excluding the portion of the data from 
the placebo exposed period for the subjects in the placebo treatment sequences.
All PsA: includes protocols A3921091, A3921125 and A3921092. 
Tofa = Tofacitinib. Includes all Tofacitinib exposed subjects.

CI=confidence interval; IR=incidence rate (number of subjects with the event per 100 subject-years); 
N=number of subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set; PY=patient-year (in subject-year).
28-Day (While on Treatment) Risk Period is defined as the smallest of [time (in days) to last dose + 28 days], 
[time to discontinuation from study], [time to last observation], and [time to death].
Under While on Treatment Estimand, PY (denominator for IR) is the sum of the times to the first event for 
subjects with an event or the risk periods for subjects without an event within the 28-Day (While on 
Treatment) Risk Period.
Incidence rates are estimated based on n (Number of subjects with an event within the 28-Day (While on 
Treatment) Risk Period) under this estimand. 95% CI for IR is based on Exact Poisson Distribution without 
adjustment to study.
For subjects randomized to Placebo  Tofa 5 mg BID, the date of first dose refers to the date of first dose of 
tofacitinib treatment.

Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: Results are described for the 31 March 2018 datacut, 
the primary analyses.  Results from the larger patient population included in the 31 January 
2019 datacut were similar.
In the full sample (i.e., untrimmed/unmatched), there were 288 observed serious infection 
events among the bDMARD group with a resulting crude incidence rate of 2.97 (95% 
CI=2.64-3.34) per 100 person-years.  There were 64 observed serious infection events among 
the tofacitinib group with a resulting crude incidence rate of 3.07 (95% CI=2.36-3.92) per 
100 person-years.
Crude rates of serious infection events were similar in propensity score (PS) matched and PS 
trimmed cohorts.  In the matched cohorts, there were 145 observed serious infection events 
Page 95
among bDMARD initiators for a crude incidence rate of 3.43 (95% CI=2.89-4.03) per 100 
person-years.  There were 51 observed serious infection events (among the PS matched 
tofacitinib group) with a resulting crude incidence rate of 3.45 (95% CI=2.57-4.54) per 100 
person-years.
Please see table below for the crude rates and 95% CI for safety events of interest (acute 
exposure) among eligible RA patients initiating tofacitinib, bDMARD, or csDMARD.

safety study that evaluated tofacitinib in RA patients from a registry (US Corrona) showed 
that a numerically higher IR of serious infection was observed for the PR 11 mg tablet 
administered once daily than the 5 mg film-coated tablet administered twice daily.  Crude 
IRs (95% CI) (i.e., not adjusted for age or sex) from availability of both formulations at 12 
months following initiation of treatment were 3.45 (1.93, 5.69) and 2.78 (1.74, 4.21) and at 
36 months were 4.71 (3.08, 6.91) and 2.79 (2.01, 3.77) patients with events per 100 patient-
years in the PR 11 mg tablet once daily and film-coated 5 mg tablet twice daily groups, 
respectively.  The unadjusted HR was 1.30 (95% CI; 0.67, 2.50) at 12 months and 1.93 (95% 
CI; 1.15, 3.24) at 36 months for the PR 11 mg once daily dose compared to the film-coated 5 
mg twice daily dose.  Data is based on a small number of patients with events observed with 
relatively large confidence intervals and limited follow up time.

For the same adverse event of interest, the most serious case was selected in this summary, subject to a risk 
period of 28 days beyond the last dose or to a risk period of up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the last 
contact date.
The risk period was minimum of (last contact date, Last Study Treatment Dose date + 28 days).
The last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, 
Telephone Contact date).
If a subject died, last contact date was the death date.
For subjects randomized to the TNFi group, adalimumab was administered in US, Puerto Rico and Canada, 
and etanercept was administered in the rest of the world.

The most common serious infection reported in patients receiving tofacitinib was pneumonia; 
other commonly reported serious infections included skin and soft tissue infections.  Of the 
38 cases of TB above, 28 occurred in countries with high overall rates of TB.  In the 
Page 104
tofacitinib RA development programme, OIs excluding TB were infrequent.  Infections 
classified as opportunistic that were reported in patients treated with tofacitinib in the All RA 
population included oesophageal candidiasis, invasive candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, 
cryptococcosis, pneumocystis pneumonia, multidermatomal/disseminated HZ, non-TB 
mycobacteria, nocardiosis, and BK virus encephalitis.

For the same adverse event of interest, the most severe case was selected in this summary, subject to a risk 
period of 28 days beyond the last dose or to a risk period of up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the last 
contact date.
The risk period was minimum of (last contact date, Last Study Treatment Dose date + 28 days).
The last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, 
Telephone Contact date).
If a subject died, last contact date was the death date.
For subjects randomized to the TNFi group, adalimumab was administered in US, Puerto Rico and Canada, 
and etanercept was administered in the rest of the world.

The most common serious infection reported in patients receiving tofacitinib was herpes 
zoster (5 events); other serious infections for which there were more than single events were 
anal abscess (4 events), appendicitis (3 events), Clostridium difficile infection, ophthalmic 
herpes zoster, and sinusitis (2 events each).  In the tofacitinib UC development programme, 
OIs excluding TB were infrequent. In the All UC population, infections classified as 
opportunistic included multidermatomal/disseminated HZ, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, 
cytomegalovirus disease, and cytomegalovirus hepatitis.
JIA: In the JIA integrated safety analysis population, of the total 6 serious infection events, 2 
were assessed as severe and 4 were assessed as moderate in severity.

VII.3.1.1.2.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Risk factors/groups for serious infections include patients who are elderly or diabetic, 
patients that use drugs along with tofacitinib that suppress the immune system (including 
corticosteroids), patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts, and patients from certain 
Asian countries.
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The risk factors associated 
with serious infection events were similar between tofacitinib and bDMARD groups in 
patients with moderate-to-severe disease (such as history of hypertension, history of diabetes 
mellitus, age 70+, age 60+).  The rates of serious infection events were higher without 
overlapping 95% CI in patients 65 and older than in patients younger than 65 in both 
tofacitinib initiators [<65 years: 2.03 (1.35, 2.94); ≥65 years: 5.1 (3.57, 7.06)] and bDMARD 
initiators [<65 years: 2.15 (1.8, 2.54); ≥65 years: 4.54 (3.85, 5.33)].  The 95% CI overlapped 
between the tofacitinib group ≥65 years and bDMARD group ≥65 years.
VII.3.1.1.2.5. Preventability
In general, preventive measures may include screening for infections prior to initiation of 
tofacitinib treatment and monitoring lymphocytes counts during therapy.
Considering the increased risk of serious infections with tofacitinib in patients 65 years of 
age and older, tofacitinib should only be used in these patients if no suitable treatment 
alternatives are available.
It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in adult patients with a low neutrophil 
count (ie, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1000 cells/mm3).  It is recommended not to 
initiate dosing in paediatric patients with an ANC less than 1200 cells/mm3.  Tofacitinib dose 
should be interrupted or adjusted based on ANC.  Neutrophils should be monitored at 
baseline, 4-8 weeks after starting tofacitinib, and every 3 months thereafter.
Page 108
It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in adult and paediatric patients with a 
low lymphocyte count (ie, less than 750/mm3).  In patients who develop a confirmed absolute 
lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm3 treatment with tofacitinib is not recommended. 
Lymphocytes should be monitored at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.
Tofacitinib should not be used in combination with biologics such as TNF antagonists, IL-1R 
antagonists, IL-6R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-
stimulation modulators, IL 17 antagonists, IL 12/IL23 antagonists, and potent 
immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus 
because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.
VII.3.1.1.2.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Infections may be mild and self-limiting or more severe and sometimes fatal.
VII.3.1.1.2.7. Public health impact
Serious infection including TB and opportunistic infection (OI) is one of the common causes 
of morbidity and mortality.  The impact of these infections on public health is significant 
both in terms of lost time at work and increased burden on medical care.
VII.3.1.1.2.7.1. Risk of opportunistic infections in Asian patients
The risk of OIs was examined by geographic region and individual Asian country.  As noted 
in VII.3.1.1.2.7.1, tofacitinib is associated with an increased risk of HZ, specifically in 
Japanese and Korean patients.  To assess the risk of OI separately from the risk of HZ, events 
of HZ that are not considered OI, ie, cases other than those that were adjudicated as 
multidermatomal (nonadjacent or >2 adjacent dermatomes) or disseminated, were excluded 
from the analysis.
RA: The crude rate of OI excluding HZ and TB appears higher in the Asian region (0.41
subjects with events/100 PY) compared to the combined rate in Non-Asian regions (0.07
subjects with events/100 PY; IR point estimates ranged from 0.03-0.17 subjects with 
events/100 PY) (Table 68).  However, the rate was not increased uniformly across the 
different Asian countries.  No OI were reported in India, and 1 case each was reported in 
Thailand and China.  When each individual Asian country is examined, the rate appears 
higher in Japan, Korea and Australia/New Zealand.  The number of cases is small in Korea 
and Australia/New Zealand; thus, the stability of these estimates raises questions as to their 
accurate interpretation as well as the need to consider the influence of medical practice and 
geographic distribution of pathogens on reporting.

Taken as a whole, the data do not clearly support a warning that Japanese or patients from 
other Asian countries are at increased risk of OI, other than the acknowledged risk for HZ.  
This is due to the small number of OI events and the degree of uncertainty raised by 
increased regional background rates of specific OI and/or differences in local medical 
practices such that a definitive interpretation is not possible.

VII.3.1.1.3. Herpes Zoster (HZ) Reactivation
VII.3.1.1.3.1. Potential mechanisms
The mechanism by which infection risk is increased in patients is likely to be multifactorial.  
In addition to the underlying disease, therapies used to treat the disease have effects on the 
immune system.  Tofacitinib inhibits cytokines that are integral to lymphocyte activation, 
proliferation, and function, and inhibition of their signalling may thus result in modulation of 
multiple aspects of the immune response.

Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: Results are described for the 31 March 2018 datacut, 
the primary analyses.  Results from the larger patient population included in the 31 January 
2019 datacut were similar.
In the full sample (i.e., untrimmed/unmatched), the crude incidence rate of total HZ events 
was increased among the tofacitinib group with 34 events with a crude incidence rate of 1.61 
(95% CI =1.11, 2.25) when compared with the bDMARD group (crude incidence rate of 0.73 
Page 113
[95% CI = 0.57, 0.92], CIs do not overlap).  This difference was driven by non-serious HZ 
events (0 serious events occurred in the tofacitinib group and 4 in the bDMARD group).
When comparing crude rates of events among tofacitinib initiators with rates among 
csDMARD initiators, incidence rates of total HZ events were increased among the tofacitinib 
compared with the csDMARD group (crude incidence rate of 0.44 [95% CI = 0.23, 0.75]).  
CIs for total HZ did not overlap.  This difference in total HZ was driven by non-serious HZ 
events.  
The crude incidence rate of total HZ events in the trimmed cohort was increased among the 
tofacitinib group (crude incidence rate of 1.59 [95% CI = 1.02, 2.37]) when compared with 
the bDMARD group (crude incidence rate of 0.69 [95% CI = 0.52, 0.90]).  This difference 
was driven by non-serious HZ events.  
Please see table below for the crude rates and 95% CI for safety events of interest (acute 
exposure) among eligible RA patients initiating tofacitinib, bDMARD, or csDMARD.

Severity and nature of risk
RA: In the All RA population 327 HZ cases were mild, 434 were moderate, and 34 were 
severe.
Study A3921133: The severity of all HZ for the following treatment groups were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: mild (61), moderate (110), severe (9)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: mild (49), moderate (116), severe (13)
 All Tofa: mild (110), moderate (226), severe (22)
 TNFi: mild (16), moderate (40), severe (2)
PsA: In the All PsA population, 15 HZ cases were mild, 20 were moderate, and 1 was severe.
UC: In the All UC population, 34 HZ cases were mild, 53 were moderate, and 5 were severe.
JIA: In the JIA integrated safety analysis population, 2 HZ cases were mild and 1 was 
moderate.
Page 116
AS: In the All AS population (All Tofa 5 mg BID), 3 HZ cases were mild and 2 were 
moderate.  None were severe.  In the All AS population (All Tofa), 4 HZ cases were mild 
and 3 were moderate.  None were severe.
VII.3.1.1.3.4. Risk factors and risk groups
There is a higher rate of HZ in Japanese and Korean patients.  Patients who have had RA for 
many years, were elderly, or have previously used two or more medicines that depress the 
immune system, including so called targeted biologic (antibody) therapies, such as those that 
inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and corticosteroids also have an increased risk.  Patients with 
a low white blood cell (lymphocyte) count may have an increased risk of HZ.  Patients 
treated with 10 mg twice daily also have an increased risk.
VII.3.1.1.3.5. Preventability
In general, preventive measures may include screening for infections prior to initiation of 
tofacitinib treatment and monitoring lymphocytes counts during therapy.
Prophylactic zoster vaccination should be considered in accordance with vaccination 
guidelines.  Particular consideration should be given to patients with longstanding RA who 
have received 2 or more prior bDMARDs.
VII.3.1.1.3.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
HZ may be mild, moderate, or severe and sometimes life-threatening.
VII.3.1.1.3.7. Public health impact
HZ infections, in particular severe types of HZ infection (eg, disseminated HZ), can lead to 
morbidity and mortality.  The impact of these infections on public health is significant both 
in terms of lost time at work and increased burden on medical care.
VII.3.1.1.3.7.1. Risk of herpes zoster infections in Asian patients
RA: In tofacitinib RA clinical studies, the large majority of subjects who self-identified as of 
Asian race were from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, or the south Asian countries (Thailand, 
Malaysia, Philippines, and India).  The self-identified racial category of Asian had a higher 
proportion of subjects reporting HZ infections than did the other race categories in the All 
RA population (Table 73).
To determine whether this increased rate is a broad regional effect versus a country level 
effect, the rate of HZ was assessed by individual Asian country.  As shown in Table 74, only 
the HZ rates in Japan and Korea were clearly higher than in non-Asian regions based on 
non-overlapping confidence intervals and also compared to rates in other Asian countries 
(range 2.9-5.4/100 PY).  The increased risk of HZ in Japanese and Korean patients treated 
with tofacitinib is communicated in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

VII.3.1.1.4. Lung Cancer
VII.3.1.1.4.1. Potential mechanisms
The potential mechanism of tofacitinib, as a risk for lung cancer, is unclear.  It is possible 
that tofacitinib may affect tumour immunosurveillance as a result of its immunosuppressive 
effects; this may manifest particularly in patients whose immune system is compromised due 
to biologic considerations (such as older age) or extrinsic factors (such as smoking).

lung cancer. In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients 
with RA who were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk 
factor, an increased incidence of malignancies excluding NMSC, particularly lung cancer,
lymphoma, and an increase in NMSC was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF 
inhibitors.
Summary of Study A3921133 results: an increase in malignancies excluding NMSC, 
particularly lung cancer and lymphoma, was observed in patients treated with tofacitinib 
compared to TNF inhibitor.  The IRs of lung cancer per 100 PY (95% CI) (based on total 
time) for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All tofacitinib, and TNFi groups, 
respectively, were 0.23 (0.12, 0.40), 0.32 (0.18, 0.51), 0.28 (0.19, 0.39), 0.13 (0.05, 0.26).
VII.3.1.1.4.5. Preventability
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with other malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy 
other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer) tofacitinib should only be used
if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.

VII.3.1.1.4.6. Impact on the risk-benefit of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib for the approved indications and the routine 
and additional risk mitigation measures that are being proposed to manage the risk of lung 
cancer, the benefit:risk balance for tofacitinib at the recommended doses remains favourable.
VII.3.1.1.4.7. Public health impact
Lung cancer is a major public health burden and is the leading cause of cancer-related death 
among men and women globally.287  
VII.3.1.1.5. Lymphoma
VII.3.1.1.5.1. Potential mechanisms
The potential mechanism of tofacitinib, as a risk for lymphoma, is unclear.  It is possible that 
tofacitinib may affect tumour immunosurveillance as a result of its immunosuppressive 
effects; this may manifest particularly in patients whose immune system is compromised due 
to biologic considerations (such as older age) or extrinsic factors (such as smoking).

VII.3.1.1.5.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with RA, particularly those with highly active disease, may be at higher risk (up to 
several fold) than general population for the development of lymphoma. In Study 
A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who were 50 
years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an increased 
incidence of malignancies excluding NMSC, particularly lung cancer, lymphoma, and an 
increase in NMSC was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.
Summary of Study A3921133 results: an increase in malignancies excluding NMSC, 
particularly lung cancer and lymphoma, was observed in patients treated with tofacitinib 
compared to TNF inhibitor.  The IRs of lymphoma per 100 PY (95% CI) (based on total 
time) for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All tofacitinib, and TNFi groups, 
respectively, were 0.07 (0.02, 0.18), 0.11 (0.04, 0.24), 0.09 (0.04, 0.17), 0.02 (0.00, 0.10).
VII.3.1.1.5.5. Preventability
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with other malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy 
other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer) tofacitinib should only be used  
if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
VII.3.1.1.5.6. Impact on the risk-benefit of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib for the approved indications and the routine 
and additional risk mitigation measures that are being proposed to manage the risk of 
lymphoma, the benefit:risk balance for tofacitinib at the recommended doses remains 
favourable.
VII.3.1.1.5.7. Public health impact
Lymphoma is the seventh most frequent cancer diagnosis in the world288 and thus may pose a 
major public health burden.
VII.3.1.1.6. Myocardial Infarction
VII.3.1.1.6.1. Potential mechanisms
The potential mechanism of tofacitinib, as a risk for MI, is unknown.  Assessments of clinical 
and molecular/biomarker data (such as D-Dimer, lipids, and platelet) from the tofacitinib 
program have been conducted to better understand the potential mechanism.  Whilst an 
increase in MI was observed in Study A3921133 in tofacitinib treatment arms relative to the 
TNF inhibitor treatment arm, a conclusive mechanistic basis for this finding has not been 
identified.

treatment groups were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: moderate (4), severe (14)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: moderate (2), severe (17)
 All Tofa: moderate (6), severe (31)
 TNFi: moderate (3), severe (7) 
PsA: In the All PsA population, adjudicated 1 MI was moderate and 1 was severe.
UC: In the All UC population, 1 adjudicated MI was mild, 2 were severe.  
JIA: There were no cases of MI from the JIA integrated safety analysis population.
AS: There were no cases of MI in the AS clinical development programme.
VII.3.1.1.6.4. Risk factors and risk groups
In Study A3921133, a large, randomised active-controlled post authorisation safety 
surveillance study of RA patients who were 50 years of age and older and had at least one 
additional cardiovascular risk factor, the following predictive factors for development of MI 
(fatal and non-fatal) were identified using a multivariate Cox model with backward selection: 
age ≥65 years, male, current or past smoking, history of diabetes, and history of coronary 
artery disease (which includes myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stable angina 
pectoris, or coronary artery procedures).
Summary of Study A3921133 results: an increase in incidence of non-fatal MI was observed 
with tofacitinib compared to TNFi.  The IRs of adjudicated non-fatal MI per 100 PY (95% 
CI) (based on 60 days risk period) for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All 
tofacitinib, and TNFi groups, respectively, were 0.37 (0.22, 0.57), 0.33 (0.19, 0.53), 0.35
(0.24, 0.48), 0.16 (0.07, 0.31).  The IRs of adjudicated fatal MI per 100 PY (95% CI) (based 
on 60 days risk period) for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All tofacitinib, 
and TNFi groups, respectively, were 0.00 (0.00, 0.07), 0.06 (0.01, 0.18), 0.03 (0.01, 0.09), 
0.06 (0.01, 0.17).
VII.3.1.1.6.5. Preventability
In a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who were 50 years of age 
or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an increased incidence of MI 
was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  In patients 65 years of age and 
older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and patients with history of 
Page 132
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, tofacitinib should
only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
VII.3.1.1.6.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib for the approved indications and the routine 
and additional risk mitigation measures that are being proposed to manage the risk of MI, the 
benefit:risk balance for tofacitinib at the recommended doses remains favourable.
VII.3.1.1.6.7. Public health impact
MI is a key component of the burden of cardiovascular disease, which is among the leading 
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.289  People with MI have a risk of recurrence 
and/or development of coronary heart disease-related conditions 6 times higher than those 
with no history of MI.290
VII.3.1.1.7. Decrease in Haemoglobin (Hgb) Levels and Anaemia
VII.3.1.1.7.1. Potential mechanisms
The mechanism of action of tofacitinib in the development of anaemia is not known.  In RA 
patients, tofacitinib-mediated inhibition of erythropoietin signalling may occur via inhibition 
of JAK2 signalling; however, this mechanism likely requires higher doses than those 
recommended for use in RA patients.

VII.3.1.1.7.4. Risk factors and risk groups
No risk groups have been identified.
VII.3.1.1.7.5. Preventability
It is recommended that tofacitinib not be initiated in patients with Hgb < 9 g/dL.  It is 
recommended not to initiate dosing in paediatric patients with haemoglobin less than 
10 g/dL.  No data are available to identify specific measures that can be used to prevent the 
occurrence of anaemia; however, the Phase 3 data have demonstrated that instances of 
clinically important anaemia are infrequent and can be adequately managed by routine 
monitoring.
VII.3.1.1.7.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
The risk of clinically important anaemia is generally manageable with appropriate screening 
and monitoring.
VII.3.1.1.7.7. Public health impact
Anaemia can pose a significant impact on public health.  Untreated anaemia can lead to 
morbidity and mortality and increase the burden on healthcare.
5 pJIA: Severity based on post-baseline lab values Hgb (g/dL). Mild: decrease by 2 ≤ change from 
baseline in haemoglobin ≤ decrease by 1; moderate: (decrease by 3 < change from baseline in haemoglobin < 
decrease by 2) or (7 < haemoglobin < 8); severe: change from baseline in haemoglobin  decrease by 3 or 
haemoglobin  7.

VII.3.1.1.8. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC)
VII.3.1.1.8.1. Potential mechanisms
Given tofacitinib is an immunomodulator, the risk of NMSC might be due to the impact of 
tofacitinib treatment on the immune system.

Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The table below presents crude incidence rates (i.e., 
number of events per 100 person-years) and associated 95% CIs for NMSC in the full 
sample, trimmed, and matched tofacitinib, bDMARD, and csDMARD (full sample only) 
initiators.  
Page 140
In the full sample, crude and age- and sex- adjusted incidence rates of NMSC were similar 
among the tofacitinib group when compared with the bDMARD group and the CIs 
overlapped.  Across trimmed and matched populations, incidence rates of NMSC were 
similar among the tofacitinib and bDMARD treated patients with overlapping CIs.

VII.3.1.1.8.4. Risk factors and risk groups
In the RA programme, NMSC primarily occurred in sun-exposed areas of the body including 
the face/head and hands.  The commonly reported risk factors of NMSC include sun 
exposure (ie, ultraviolet), medications that suppress the immune system, light therapy, virus 
infections (eg, Human papilloma virus), age, and certain types of radiation.
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who 
were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an 
increased incidence of malignancies excluding NMSC, particularly lung cancer, lymphoma, 
and an increase in NMSC was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.
VII.3.1.1.8.5. Preventability
Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those who are at 
increased risk for skin cancer.  As there is a higher incidence of NMSC in the elderly and in 
patients with a prior history of NMSC, caution should be used when treating these types of 
patients.  In general, avoidance of risk factors like excessive exposure to sun is 
recommended.
Page 145
VII.3.1.1.8.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
NMSCs that are detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always curable 
and cause minimal damage.  Advanced-stage skin cancers that are located in the head and 
neck region may require surgery that can be disfiguring.291
VII.3.1.1.8.7. Public health impact
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in fair-skinned individuals around the world.  
Although NMSC is rarely fatal, it can cause significant morbidity.
VII.3.1.1.8.7.1. Ratio of squamous cell carcinoma vs. basal cell carcinoma
RA: BCC is more common than SCC in the general population, whereas among 
immunocompromised subjects (such as transplant recipients) the ratio is reversed.292  In the 
tofacitinib RA clinical programme, the ratio for SCC to BCC based on the combined dataset 
from the Phase 1, 2, 3 and LTE studies was approximately 1:1. Although there appears to be 
a shift in relative proportions of SCC and BCC as compared to those reported in general 
population, that change is generally expected in RA patients who are often treated with 
immunomodulatory drugs.  The ratio of SCC to BCC observed in RA patients treated with 
tofacitinib (ie, 1:1) appears to be comparable to what have been reported in RA patients 
treated with bDMARDs.293,294  In study A3921133, a randomised post-authorisation safety 
study in patients with RA who were 50 years or older with at least one additional 
cardiovascular risk factor, an increase in overall NMSC, including cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinomas, was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  When examining the 
ratio of SCC to BCC across the dose groups (5 mg vs. 10 mg BID), no significant differences 
were noted.  Additionally, there appears to be no difference in the absolute risk of SCC when 
comparing the IR of SCC between patients treated with tofacitinib vs. other bDMARDs.  For 
example, the IR of SCC in RA patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID was 0.21 per 100 
PYs, which is similar to 0.26 per 100 PYs reported in RA patients treated with TNFi.
In summary, based on review of the tofacitinib clinical data, a shift in relative proportions of 
SCC and BCC as compared to those reported in general population was noted.  That change 
is expected in RA patients considering the underlying disease and concomitant use of 
immunomodulatory drugs.  The ratio of SCC to BCC in RA patients treated with tofacitinib
appears to be comparable to those reported in RA patients treated with bDMARDs.  The risk 
of NMSC and the ratio of SCC to BCC will continue to be monitored and evaluated through 
on-going and future Pharmacovigilance (PV) activities.
PsA: The SCC to BCC ratio for the All PsA population (combined 5 mg and 10 mg dose 
groups) is 5:11. 
The risk of NMSC and the ratio of SCC to BCC will continue to be monitored and evaluated 
through on-going and future pharmacovigilance activities.  
UC: The SCC to BCC ratio for the All UC population (combined 5 mg and 10 mg dose 
groups) is 11:15.

AS: There were no NMSC cases in the AS clinical development programme.

RA: In the All RA population, 1023 patients experienced AEs that coded to the Drug related 
hepatic disorders Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) and 144 of these patients 
discontinued study drug due to events in this SMQ.
Study A3921133: There were 172 AES (5 serious) in the tofacitinib 5mg BID, 175 (6 
serious) in the tofacitinib 10mg BID, 347 (11 serious) in the All tofa, and 135 (6 serious) in 
the TNFi groups that coded to the Drug related hepatic disorders SMQ.  There were 2, 10, 
12, and 4 discontinuations due to hepatobiliary disorders AEs in the tofacitinib 5mg BID 
tofacitinib 10mg BID, All tofa, and TNFi groups, respectively.
PsA: In the RCTs, 1 subject was discontinued due to an AE of transaminases increased.  In 
the All PsA population, an additional subject was discontinued due to an AE of significant 
elevation of liver enzymes.
UC: In the RCTs (induction studies), 1 subject in the 10 mg dose group with elevated liver 
transaminases was discontinued (adjudicated as possible DILI). In the RCT (maintenance 
study), 1 subject in the 10 mg dose group with elevated liver transaminases was discontinued 
(adjudicated as possible DILI).  
Page 151
JIA: In the ISAP population, 1 case of adjudicated possible DILI and 2 cases of adjudicated 
probable DILI were reported in subjects on background MTX.  All 3 cases resolved after 
discontinuation of MTX therapy and after interruption, or permanent discontinuation, of 
tofacitinib.
AS: In the RCTs (Tofa 5 mg BID), 1 subject was discontinued with increased AST, ALT, 
and GGT, but was not adjudicated as possible DILI.

Severity7 and nature of risk
RA: Transaminase increases were relatively common in RA patients treated with tofacitinib 
but were mostly mild to moderate (<3 × ULN) and most of these abnormalities occurred in 
patients with background DMARDs (primarily MTX).  Transaminase elevations were not
associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with 
clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency.  
Study A3921133: A slight median increase from baseline over time in transaminase levels 
(ALT, AST) was observed for subjects in both tofacitinib arms, which was numerically 
higher than in the TNFi arm.  Overall, a greater proportion of subjects in the tofacitinib arms 
experienced elevated transaminase levels 1 × ULN.  A higher proportion of subjects in the 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID arm had elevations of ALT and AST ≥3 × ULN, and ALT, AST ≥5 ×
ULN.
PsA: Transaminase increases were relatively common in PsA patients treated with 
tofacitinib, but most were mild (<2 × ULN), and all patients were on background DMARDs 
(primarily MTX). 
UC: Unconfirmed transaminase increases were relatively common in UC patients treated 
with tofacitinib, but most were mild to moderate (< 3 × ULN).
JIA: In the ISAP population, 1 case of adjudicated possible DILI and 2 cases of adjudicated 
probable DILI were reported in subjects on background MTX.  All 3 cases resolved after 
discontinuation of MTX therapy and after interruption, or permanent discontinuation, of 
tofacitinib.
7 Severity definitions (AST and ALT): mild = 1.2-1.5 × ULN; moderate = 1.6-3.0 × ULN; severe = 3.0-
8.0 × ULN; includes life-threatening = >8.0 ULN.
Page 153
                                                
AS: Confirmed elevated liver test values ≥3 × ULN and higher multiples of ULN were rare 
for both the RCTs and All AS populations.  No patients in the AS programme had confirmed 
elevations of AST ≥5 × ULN or ALT ≥10 × ULN or increases in bilirubin ≥2 or 3 × ULN.
VII.3.1.1.9.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Use of other medications (called DMARDs) to treat RA or to treat PsA at the same time as 
tofacitinib.
VII.3.1.1.9.5. Preventability
In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as 
reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tofacitinib, or reduction in 
tofacitinib dose, resulted in decrease or normalisation of liver enzymes.
VII.3.1.1.9.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Most patients experiencing hepatic enzyme elevation are asymptomatic; however, patients 
may experience nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and jaundice because 
of severe hepatotoxicity.
VII.3.1.1.9.7. Public health impact
Transaminase increase is not expected to have a significant impact on public health.  DILI is 
an important public health problem, contributing to more than 50% of acute liver failure 
cases, a fraction of which require urgent liver transplantation because of the irreversible 
damage to the liver.295
VII.3.1.1.10. Higher Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) in the Elderly
VII.3.1.1.10.1. Potential mechanisms
Aging is one of known factors that are associated with an increased risk of many medical 
events, such as cardiac disorders and malignancy.  Additionally, elderly patients often have 
other concurrent medical conditions and take many concomitant medications, which may put 
them at higher risk of developing AEs.

The risk period was minimum of (last contact date, Last Study Treatment Dose date + 28 days).
The last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, 
Telephone Contact Date). If a subject died, last contact date was the death date.
First events were counted within the risk period. If a subject did not have an event or had an event but outside 
the risk period, the subject was censored at the end of risk period.
For subjects randomized to the TNFi group, adalimumab was administered in US, Puerto Rico and Canada,

For the same adverse event of interest, the worst case outcome was selected in this summary, subject to a risk 
period of up to 28 days beyond the last dose or to the last contact date.
The risk period was minimum of (last contact date, Last Study Treatment Dose date + 28 days)
The last contact date was maximum of (AE start date, AE stop date, last study visit date, withdrawal date, 
Telephone Contact date).
If a subject died, last contact date was the death date.
For subjects randomized to the TNFi group, adalimumab was administered in US, Puerto Rico and Canada, 
and etanercept was administered in the rest of the world.

AS: In the All AS population, no events of interest were reported in the elderly population
(age 65 years).
VII.3.1.1.10.4. Risk factors and risk groups
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who 
were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, patients 
65 years of age and older had an increased risk of serious infections, MI, malignancies, and 
all-cause mortality with tofacitinib. 
VII.3.1.1.10.5. Preventability
Considering the increased risk of serious infections, MI, malignancies, and all-cause 
mortality with tofacitinib in patients 65 years of age and older, tofacitinib should only be 
used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
Page 167
VII.3.1.1.10.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
As compared to younger patients, AEs reported in elderly patients may be more severe and 
sometimes life-threatening.
VII.3.1.1.10.7. Public health impact
The higher risk of AEs may have some significant impacts on public health both in terms of 
lost time at work and increased burden on medical care.
VII.3.1.2. Important Potential Risks
VII.3.1.2.1. Malignancy
VII.3.1.2.1.1. Potential mechanisms
The potential role of Janus kinase inhibition in malignancies (excluding NMSC) is not 
known.
VII.3.1.2.1.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
Clinical trial data and post-marketing data.

Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: In the full sample, crude and age- and sex- adjusted 
incidence rates of malignancy excluding NMSC were slightly increased among the 
tofacitinib group when compared with the bDMARD group, although the CIs overlapped.  
Across trimmed and matched populations, incidence rates of malignancy excluding NMSC 
were similar among the tofacitinib and bDMARD treated patients with overlapping CIs.  
Please see table below for the crude rates and 95% CI for safety events of interest (latent 
exposure) among eligible RA patients initiating tofacitinib, bDMARD, or csDMARD.

Severity8 and nature of the risk
RA: In the All RA population, there were 179 cases of malignancies (excluding NMSC).  Of 
these cases, there were 14 cases of melanoma and 30 cases of breast cancer.  Of the 179 cases 
8 Severity definitions: mild = does not interfere with subject’s usual function; moderate = interferes to 
some extent with subject’s usual function; severe = interferes significantly with subject’s usual function.
Page 173
                                                
of malignancies (excluding NMSC), the severity was assessed as mild (24), moderate (58), 
severe (95), and unknown (2).
Study A3921133: The severity of adjudicated malignancy excluding NMSC for the 
following treatment groups were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: mild (6), moderate (14), severe (35)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: mild (2), moderate (8), severe (35)
 All Tofa: mild (8), moderate (22), severe (70)
 TNFi: mild (3), moderate (14), severe (22) 
PsA: In the All PsA population, there were 15 cases of malignancies (excluding NMSC). Of 
these cases, there were 2 cases of breast cancer.  All of the malignancies (excluding NMSC) 
were assessed as serious. Of the 15 cases of malignancies (excluding NMSC), the severity 
was assessed as mild (1), moderate (6), and severe (8).
UC: In the All UC population, there were 20 cases of malignancies (excluding NMSC). Of 
these cases, there were 2 cases of breast cancer and 2 cases of melanoma.
JIA: There were no cases of malignancy from the JIA integrated safety analysis population.
AS: There were no malignancies in the AS programme.
VII.3.1.2.1.4. Risk factors and risk groups
The risk of malignancy (cancer) in general is increased in the elderly population.  In a 
randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who were 50 years of age or 
older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an increased incidence of 
malignancies, particularly NMSC, lung cancer and lymphoma, was observed with tofacitinib 
compared to TNF inhibitors.  The following predictive factors for development of 
malignancies excluding NMSC were identified using a Multivariate Cox model with 
backward selection: age ≥65 years and current or past smoking.
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The rates of malignancy 
excluding NMSC were higher without overlapping 95% CI in patients 65 and older than in 
patients younger than 65 in both tofacitinib and bDMARD initiator groups.  The rate of 
malignancy excluding NMSC in patients 65 and older in tofacitinib initiators was 1.77 (95% 
CI=1.17, 2.57) and the rate in bDMARD initiators was 1.22 (95% CI=0.95, 1.55); the 95% 
CI overlapped.
Summary of Study A3921133 results: an increase in malignancies (excluding NMSC), 
particularly lymphoma and lung cancer, was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNFi. 
This increased risk was predominantly observed in older patients and in patients who are 
current or past smokers.  
Page 174
The IR per 100 PY (95% CI) (based on total time) of adjudicated malignancies (excluding 
NMSC) in adults aged ≥65 years or who had ever smoked for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All Tofa, and TNFi groups, respectively, were 1.38 (1.01, 1.82), 1.59 
(1.19, 2.07), 1.48 (1.21, 1.80), and 0.96 (0.66, 1.34).  
In patients who were less than 65 years of age and had never smoked, the IR per 100 PY 
(95% CI) (based on total time) for malignancies excluding NMSC for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All Tofa, and TNFi groups, respectively, were 0.70 (0.38, 1.17), 0.31 
(0.12, 0.68), 0.51 (0.31, 0.79), and 0.44 (0.20, 0.84).
VII.3.1.2.1.5. Preventability
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with other malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy 
other than a successfully treated NMSC) tofacitinib should only be used if no suitable 
treatment alternatives are available.
It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in adult patients with a low neutrophil 
count (ie, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1000 cells/mm3).  It is recommended not to 
initiate dosing in paediatric patients with an ANC less than 1200 cells/mm3.  Tofacitinib dose 
should be interrupted or adjusted based on ANC.  Neutrophils should be monitored at 
baseline, 4-8 weeks after starting tofacitinib, and every 3 months thereafter.
It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in adult and paediatric patients with a 
low lymphocyte count (ie, less than 750/mm3).  In patients who develop a confirmed absolute 
lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm3 treatment with tofacitinib is not recommended.  
Lymphocytes should be monitored at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.
Tofacitinib should not be used in combination with biologics such as TNF antagonists, IL-1R 
antagonists, IL-6R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-
stimulation modulators, IL 17 antagonists, IL 12/IL23 antagonists, and potent 
immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus 
because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.
VII.3.1.2.1.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Malignancy can severely impact a patient’s quality of life and can be fatal.  Specific potential 
effects on an individual patient depend upon a variety of factors including site of malignancy 
and tolerance of therapy.
VII.3.1.2.1.7. Public health impact
Malignancy is a major public health problem.  It is among the leading causes of morbidity 
and mortality worldwide.296

Interventional Clinical Trials:
RA: In RCTs, the IR (95% CI) per 100 PY of adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiac Event 
(MACE) related AEs for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups, and overall, respectively, were 
0.28 (0.11, 0.58), 0.42 (0.18, 0.83), 0.35 (0.20, 0.56).  In the All RA population, the IR (95% 
CI) per 100 PY of adjudicated MACE related AEs for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups, and 
overall, respectively, were 0.38 (0.26, 0.54), 0.37 (0.27, 0.48), 0.37 (0.30, 0.46).  The IR 
(95% CI) per 100 PY of adjudicated events of non-fatal MI for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose 
groups, and overall, respectively, were 0.17 (0.09, 0.29), 0.13 (0.08, 0.21), 0.15 (0.10, 0.21).

Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: Results are described for the 31 March 2018 datacut, 
the primary analyses.  Results from the larger patient population included in the 31 January 
2019 datacut were similar.
In the full sample (i.e., untrimmed/unmatched), there were 90 observed MACE events among 
the bDMARD group with a resulting crude incidence rate of 0.92 (95% CI=0.74-1.13) per 
100 person-years.  There were 15 observed MACE events among the tofacitinib group with a 
resulting crude incidence rate of 0.70 (95% CI=0.39-1.16) per 100 person-years.  
Crude rates of MACE were similar in matched and trimmed cohorts.  In the matched cohorts, 
there were 49 observed MACE events among bDMARD initiators for a crude incidence rate 
of 1.14 (95% CI=0.84-1.50) per 100 person-years; among tofacitinib initiators there were 10 
MACE events for a crude incidence rate of 0.66 (95% CI=0.32-1.21) per 100 person-years.  
Please see table below for the crude rates and 95% CI for safety events of interest (acute 
exposure) among eligible RA patients initiating tofacitinib, bDMARD, or csDMARD.

Severity9 and nature of risk
RA: In the All RA population, 5 MACE cases were reported as mild, 19 were moderate, and 
61 were severe.  One case of non-fatal CHF was mild, 9 were moderate, and 13 were severe.
Study A3921133: The severity of adjudicated lymphoma for the following treatment groups 
were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: mild (3), moderate (10), severe (32)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: mild (1), moderate (9), severe (39)
 All Tofa: mild (4), moderate (19), severe (71)
 TNFi: mild (4), moderate (9), severe (22) 
PsA: In the All PsA population, 1 MACE case was reported as mild, 2 were moderate, and 3 
were severe.  There were no cases of nonfatal CHF. 
UC: In the All UC population, 1 MACE case was reported as mild, 1 was moderate, and 6 
were severe.  Of the 3 cases of nonfatal CHF, 1 was mild and 2 were moderate.
JIA: There were no cases of MACE from the JIA integrated safety analysis population.
AS: There were no MACE cases in the AS programme.
VII.3.1.2.2.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with autoimmune diseases have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders.  The 
risk of cardiovascular events in general is increased in the elderly population.  Tofacitinib has 
been associated with increased cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), and weight
gain, which are known risk factors for cardiovascular events.  
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who 
were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an 
increased incidence of MACE was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  
Please refer to Section VII.3.1.1.6.4 for risk factors identified for MI in Study A3921133.
A post-hoc analysis of Study A3921133 identified age ≥65 years, current or past long-time 
smoking and, for MACE specifically, history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD, i.e., a composite of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral 
artery disease) as risk factors accounting for the difference in adverse events of special 
interest between tofacitinib and TNF inhibitors.  
9 Severity definitions: mild = does not interfere with subject’s usual function; moderate = interferes to 
some extent with subject’s usual function; severe = interferes significantly with subject’s usual function.

Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The rates of MACE were 
higher in patients 65 and older than in patients younger than 65 in both tofacitinib and 
bDMARD initiator groups, with overlapping 95% CIs.  The rate of MACE in patients 65 and 
older in tofacitinib initiators was 1.23 (95% CI=0.56, 2.34) and the rate in bDMARD 
initiators was 1.43 (95% CI=1.06, 1.89); the 95% CI overlapped. 
VII.3.1.2.2.5. Preventability
It is recommended to monitor lipid parameters 8 weeks following initiation of tofacitinib 
therapy.  Patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for the management of 
hyperlipidaemia to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.  
MACE have been observed in patients taking tofacitinib.  
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk 
factors, tofacitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
VII.3.1.2.2.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
These events may be serious and lead to hospitalisation.
VII.3.1.2.2.7. Public health impact
CVD is a major public health problem.  It is among the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide.
VII.3.1.2.3. Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation
VII.3.1.2.3.1. Potential mechanisms
In evaluating whether tofacitinib could promote GI perforations, 2 potential mechanisms 
were considered most relevant, impaired wound healing and altered immune balance in the 
intestine.
VII.3.1.2.3.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
Clinical trial data and post-marketing data.
VII.3.1.2.3.3. Characterisation of the risk

Severity11 and nature of risk
RA: In the All RA population 6 GI perforations were moderate and 21 were severe.
Study A3921133: The severity of adjudicated GI perforation for the following treatment 
groups were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: moderate (1), severe (8)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: severe (5)
 All Tofa: moderate (1), severe (13)
 TNFi: moderate (2), severe (2)
PsA: In the All PsA population, the single GI perforation case was severe.
UC: In the All UC population, all 3 GI perforation cases (revised definition10) were severe.
JIA: There were no cases of GI perforation from the JIA integrated safety analysis 
population.
AS: There were no GI perforation cases in the AS programme.
VII.3.1.2.3.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with painful inflammation of small pockets in the lining of the intestine 
(diverticulitis) or patients who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 
corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) may be at higher risk.
VII.3.1.2.3.5. Preventability
No data are available to identify specific measures that can be used to prevent the occurrence 
of GI perforation.
VII.3.1.2.3.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Depending on the location and severity of the event, the impact on an individual patient’s 
quality of life may vary considerably. GI perforations are life-threatening emergencies and 
warrant prompt medical/surgical intervention.  Fistulas can cause considerable patient 
morbidity and can have a profound impact on an individual patient’s quality of life and may 
require prompt surgical/medical intervention to prevent or manage life-threatening 
complications.
11 Severity definitions: mild = does not interfere with subject’s usual function; moderate = interferes to 
some extent with subject’s usual function; severe = interferes significantly with subject’s usual function.
Page 185
                                                
VII.3.1.2.3.7. Public health impact
GI perforation is not expected to have a significant impact on public health; however, these 
events can lead to hospitalisation or death, which may increase the burden on health care 
systems.
VII.3.1.2.4. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
VII.3.1.2.4.1. Potential mechanisms
The most common cause of ILD is idiopathic.  The relative contribution of tofacitinib vs. 
other factors including use of MTX and RA to the development of ILD is not known.
VII.3.1.2.4.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
Clinical trial data and post-marketing data.
VII.3.1.2.4.3. Characterisation of the risk

1.40).
Seriousness/outcome
RA: In the All RA population, there were 45 ILD cases, of which 19 events were considered 
serious and 26 were considered non-serious.  The outcomes were resolved (21), still present 
(23), and fatal (1).

Severity12 and nature of risk
RA: In the All RA population 19 ILD cases were reported as mild, 18 were moderate, and 8 
were severe.
12 Severity definitions: mild = does not interfere with subject’s usual function; moderate = interferes to 
some extent with subject’s usual function; severe = interferes significantly with subject’s usual function.

PsA: In the All PsA population, 1 ILD case was severe.
UC: In the entire UC programme, there were no events assessed as ILD by the review 
committee.
JIA: There were no cases of ILD from the JIA integrated safety analysis population.
AS: There were no ILD cases in the AS programme.
VII.3.1.2.4.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Patients living in some Asian countries.
VII.3.1.2.4.5. Preventability
No data are available to identify specific measures that can be used to prevent the occurrence 
of ILD.  Tofacitinib should be used with caution in patients with prior history of ILD and 
Asian patients.
VII.3.1.2.4.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
The potential impact on the patient ranges from benign infiltrates to life-threatening acute 
respiratory distress syndrome.  ILD may be asymptomatic, detected only on x-ray or 
Computed Tomography scan or it may cause progressive respiratory symptoms resulting in 
hospitalisation and, in some cases, respiratory insufficiency that may be fatal.
VII.3.1.2.4.7. Public health impact
ILD is not expected to have a significant impact on public health.
VII.3.1.2.4.7.1. Interstitial Lung Disease in Asian Patients
The rates of ILD in subjects treated with tofacitinib in the RA clinical development 
programme analysed based on race are shown in the table below.

As shown in the tables, no clear differences between the IR of geographic regions were 
observed in the tofacitinib clinical development programme.  Although the point estimates
for Thailand/Malaysia/Philippines and Japan were higher than other countries and regions, 
the confidence interval was wide and overlapped with the majority of other estimates.
Based on data from the clinical development programme and published literature, Asian 
patients treated with tofacitinib do not appear to be at an increased risk of ILD above the 
background risk that has been associated with Asian race.  However, the increased risk of 
ILD in Asian subjects is well established in the literature and approximately a third of 
patients reported with ILD in the tofacitinib programme were from Asian regions.  Addition 
of a general warning regarding the risk of ILD in Asian subjects is included in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC.
VII.3.1.2.5. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
PML is a rare demyelinating disorder caused by the JC polyoma virus (JCV).  Considering 
tofacitinib is an immunosuppressant, although no occurrences of PML have been observed in 
tofacitinib-treated patients, the Applicant added PML as an important potential risk to the 
RMP and will continue to monitor for potential reports of PML in the on-going clinical trials, 
registries, and during post-approval use.  No events of PML have been reported.
VII.3.1.2.5.1. Potential mechanisms
Decreased virus-specific immune surveillance allowing latent virus reactivation and 
development of viral associated diseases.
VII.3.1.2.5.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
PML has been reported in some patients taking other medications that depress the immune 
system.

VII.3.1.2.5.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Patients taking other medications along with tofacitinib that also depress the immune system.
VII.3.1.2.5.5. Preventability
Tofacitinib must not be used in combination with biologic DMARDs or other potent 
immunosuppressive agents.  Patients should be closely monitored for the development of 
signs and symptoms of infection.
VII.3.1.2.5.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
PML is a life-threatening illness.
Page 192
VII.3.1.2.5.7. Public health impact
No cases of PML have been observed with tofacitinib and the potential public health impact 
is currently considered low.
VII.3.1.2.6. All-cause Mortality
VII.3.1.2.6.1. Potential mechanisms
Mortality in patients treated with tofacitinib was mainly due to cardiovascular events, 
infections, and malignancies from A3921133.  Serious and other important infections is an 
important identified risk and CV risk and malignancy are important potential risks for 
tofacitinib.  The mechanism by which infection risk is increased in patients is likely to be 
multifactorial.  In addition to the underlying disease, therapies used to treat the disease have 
effects on the immune system.  Tofacitinib inhibits cytokines that are integral to lymphocyte 
activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of their signalling may thus result in 
modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response.  The mechanism by which 
tofacitinib is associated with CV events is unknown.  The potential role of Janus kinase 
inhibition in malignancies (excluding NMSC) is not known.

Seriousness/outcome
Post-Marketing: In the post-marketing dataset, there were 2913 fatal outcomes in the 
immediate-release or unknown formulations dataset and 1055 fatal outcomes in the 
prolonged-release formulation dataset.  The events resulting in fatal outcomes in the 
immediate-release or unknown formulations dataset (≥20) were coded to the PTs Death 
(1429), Pneumonia (85), COVID-19 (61), Sepsis (48), Myocardial infarction (43), 
Respiratory failure (40), Interstitial lung disease (37), Lung neoplasm malignant (28), 
COVID-19 pneumonia (23), Condition aggravated (22), Pulmonary embolism (22).  The 
events resulting in fatal outcomes outcomes in prolonged-release formulation dataset (≥5) 
were coded to the PTs Death (842), COVID-19 (28), Myocardial infarction (11), Pneumonia 
(9), Sepsis (9), Cerebrovascular accident (8), Cardiac arrest (5), COVID-19 pneumonia (5), 
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (5).  
Page 194
VII.3.1.2.6.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Mortality in patients treated with tofacitinib was mainly due to cardiovascular events, 
infections, and malignancies.  Risk factors/groups for serious infections include patients who 
are elderly or diabetic, patients that use medicinal products along with tofacitinib that 
suppress the immune system (including corticosteroids), patients with low absolute 
lymphocyte counts, and patients from certain Asian countries (eg, Japan, Korea).  The risk of 
cardiovascular events independently of tofacitinib is increased in the elderly population.  
Tofacitinib has been associated with increased cholesterol, high blood pressure 
(hypertension), and weight gain, which are known risk factors for cardiovascular events.  The 
risk of malignancy (cancer) in general is increased in the elderly population.  
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA who 
were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an 
increase in non-fatal MI, lung cancer, lymphoma, VTE, and NMSC was observed in patients 
treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitor.  Please refer to Section VII.3.1.1.1,
Section VII.3.1.1.4, Section VII.3.1.1.5, Section VII.3.1.1.6, and Section VII.3.1.1.8 for the 
discussion of risk factors for VTE, lung cancer, lymphoma, MI, and NMSC respectively.
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The risk factors found to 
be associated with an increased risk of mortality events were in general similar among 
tofacitinib initiators and bDMARD initiators with moderate-to-severe disease (such as
history of hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, history of VTE, age 70+, age 
60+).  In patients aged 50 years and older with moderate-to-severe disease with at least one 
CV risk factor, the incidence rates (95% CI) were comparable among tofacitinib initiators 
and bDMARD initiators.  
VII.3.1.2.6.5. Preventability
In Study A3921133 (a randomised active-controlled post authorisation safety surveillance 
study of RA patients who were 50 years of age and older and had at least one additional CV 
risk factor), increased mortality within 28 days of last treatment was observed in patients 
treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  CV risk factors were defined as current 
cigarette smoker, diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of premature 
coronary heart disease, history of coronary artery disease including a history of 
revascularization procedure, coronary artery bypass grafting, myocardial infarction, cardiac 
arrest, unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, and presence of extra-articular disease 
associated with RA, e.g. nodules, Sjögren’s syndrome, anaemia of chronic disease, 
pulmonary manifestations.
Preventive measures for serious infections may include screening for infections prior to 
initiation of tofacitinib treatment and monitoring lymphocytes counts during therapy (it is not 
recommended to initiate or continue tofacitinib treatment in patients with a confirmed 
lymphocyte count less than 750 cells/mm3 and if absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 
cells/mm3 is confirmed by repeat testing within 7 days, dosing should be discontinued).  It is 
recommended to monitor lipid parameters for CV risk.  Patients should be managed 
according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events.  There are no known preventable actions for malignancy.
Page 195
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, and 
patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular or 
malignancy risk factors, tofacitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives 
are available.  Please refer to the preventability sections of serious and other important 
infections, lung cancer, lymphoma, MI, and malignancy (Section VII.3.1.1.2.5, Section 
VII.3.1.1.4.5, Section VII.3.1.1.5.5, Section VII.3.1.1.6.5, and Section VII.3.1.2.1.5, 
respectively).  
VII.3.1.2.6.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib as described in the prescribing information 
where there is an approved indication and the list of routine and additional risk mitigation 
measures to manage the important identified risks and important potential risks (including 
serious and other important infections, CV risk, and malignancy), the benefit:risk balance for 
tofacitinib in treating patients with RA, PsA, and UC at the recommended doses remains 
favourable.  
VII.3.1.2.6.7. Public health impact
The tofacitinib post-marketing dataset contained 1360 fatal outcomes out of a total of 67,075 
cases (reporting proportion of 2.0%) with an estimated cumulative worldwide post-
authorisation exposure to tofacitinib of 209,081 patient-years (estimated reporting rate of 
0.65 per 100 patient-years).  Given the background risk of mortality in patients with RA, 
PsA, and UC, mortality associated with tofacitinib is not expected to have a significant public 
health impact.  
VII.3.1.2.7. Fractures
VII.3.1.2.7.1. Potential mechanisms 
Potential mechanisms are unknown.  Nonclinical and literature data 297 suggest that 
tofacitinib is likely to have protective properties on bone in an osteoporosis setting as has

Severity and nature of risk
RA: In the All RA population 143 fractures were mild, 306 were moderate, and 99 were 
severe.
Study A3921133: The severity of fractures for the following treatment groups were: 
 Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: mild (32), moderate (70), severe (34)
 Tofacitinib 10 mg BID: mild (22), moderate (90), severe (20)
 All Tofa: mild (54), moderate (160), severe (54)
 TNFi: mild (24), moderate (53), severe (32)
PsA: In the All PsA population, 8 fractures were mild, 23 were moderate, and 11 were 
severe.
UC: In the All UC population 16 fractures were mild, 24 were moderate, and 10 were severe.
JIA: In the JIA integrated safety analysis population, 2 fractures were mild and 4 were 
moderate.  
AS: In the All AS population (All Tofa), 2 fractures were moderate.    
Page 199
VII.3.1.2.7.4. Risk factors and risk groups
Based on the review of clinical data, an increased risk of fracture was observed in patients 
with known risk factors for fractures, such as in elderly patients, female patients, and patients 
with corticosteroid use.
VII.3.1.2.7.5. Preventability
Caution should be used in patients with known risk factors for fractures such as elderly 
patients, female patients, and patients with corticosteroid use.
VII.3.1.2.7.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Based on the established benefits of tofacitinib as described in the prescribing information 
and the list of routine and additional risk mitigation measures, the benefit:risk balance for 
tofacitinib in treating patients with RA, PsA, UC, and JIA at the recommended doses remains 
favourable.  
VII.3.1.2.7.7. Public health impact
The public health impact of fractures includes increases in physical impairments and 
psychological symptoms of fear of re-injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.
VII.3.1.2.8. Increased Risk of Adverse Events (AEs) When Tofacitinib is Administered 
in Combination with Methotrexate (MTX) in RA or PsA Patients
VII.3.1.2.8.1. Potential mechanisms
The increased rate of AEs in patients treated with tofacitinib in combination use of MTX is 
likely due to the additive effect of combining agents. MTX is known to be associated with 
many AEs, eg, infections, GI toxicity.
MTX may be hepatotoxic, particularly at high dosage or with prolonged therapy.  
Methotrexate therapy in patients with impaired renal function should be undertaken with 
extreme caution because impairment of renal function will decrease methotrexate 
elimination.  The most common adverse reactions for methotrexate include ulcerative 
stomatitis, leukopenia, vasculitis, eye-irritation and loss of libido/impotence, nausea and 
abdominal distress.
VII.3.1.2.8.2. Evidence source and strength of evidence
Clinical trial data and post-marketing data.
VII.3.1.2.8.3. Characterisation of the risk
Frequency
Interventional Clinical Trials:
RA: In RCTs, the incidence rate of treatment-emergent AEs in RA patients treated with 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID in combination with MTX was 145.36 per 100 PYs (95% CI: 137.11, 
Page 200
153.98), as compared to 164.77 per 100 PYs in patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
monotherapy (95% CI: 151.23, 179.20).
Study A3921133: Not applicable.  All subjects entering the study must have taken MTX 
continuously for at least 4 months prior to the Screening visit and have been taking a stable, 
weekly dose of MTX for at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline visit and continued taking that 
dose throughout the study, unless modification was clinically indicated.   
PsA: In the All PsA population, all patients treated with tofacitinib were treated with a 
background csDMARD, most frequently MTX.  In the RCTs background csDMARD 
treatment was mandatory.  Whilst subjects may have received tofacitinib monotherapy in the 
LTE, in the All PsA population that integrates data from both the LTE and RCT, no patients 
were treated with tofacitinib monotherapy. 
UC: Tofacitinib is not used in combination with MTX in treatment of UC.
JIA: The data in the JIA program did not show an increased risk of treatment-emergent AEs 
in patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID in combination with MTX as compared to 
patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID monotherapy. 
AS: In the All AS population, patients treated with tofacitinib were permitted concomitant 
csDMARDs, including MTX.
Frequency Results from Non-interventional PASS
US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: Counts, PY, crude rates of events of interest, and 95% 
CI for acute exposure events by subgroup of interest among tofacitinib and bDMARD 
exposed RA patients are found in the table below.  The rates of MACE were higher in the 
monotherapy groups among the tofacitinib initiators and bDMARD initiators, although the 
95% CIs overlapped.  The rates of serious infection events were numerically higher in the 
combination group among the tofacitinib initiators and monotherapy group among the 
bDMARD initiators with overlapping 95% CIs.  The rates of total HZ were higher in the 
monotherapy group among the tofacitinib initiators with overlapping 95% CIs; please note 
these were non-serious HZ events.

VII.3.1.2.9.4. Risk factors and risk groups
In general, patients treated with medications that depress the immune system are at an 
increased risk of developing a viral infection after getting a live vaccine.  This is possible 
when there is not enough time between live vaccination and the start of the medication that 
depresses the immune system or with zoster vaccination, where the patients have not had 
chicken pox in the past.
VII.3.1.2.9.5. Preventability
Prior to initiating tofacitinib, it is recommended that all patients, particularly pJIA patients 
and juvenile PsA patients, be brought up to-date with all immunisations in agreement with 
current immunisation guidelines.  It is recommended that live vaccines not be given 
concurrently with tofacitinib.  The decision to use live vaccines prior to treatment should take 
into account the degree of immunocompetence of a given patient.
Prophylactic zoster vaccination should be considered in accordance with vaccination 
guidelines. Particular consideration should be given to patients with longstanding RA who 
have received 2 or more prior bDMARDs.  If live zoster vaccine is administered; it should 
only be administered to patients with a known history of chickenpox or those that are 
seropositive for varicella zoster virus.  If the history of chickenpox is considered doubtful or 
unreliable it is recommended to test for antibodies against varicella zoster virus.  Vaccination 
with live vaccines should occur at least 2 weeks but preferably 4 weeks prior to initiation of 
tofacitinib or in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding 
immunomodulatory agents such as tofacitinib.
VII.3.1.2.9.6. Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Primary viral infection may be mild, moderate, or severe and sometimes life-threatening.
VII.3.1.2.9.7. Public health impact
Primary viral infection can lead to morbidity and mortality.  The impact of the infections on 
public health is significant both in terms of lost time at work and increased burden on 
medical care.

Anticipated 
risk/consequence of the 
missing information
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of tofacitinib in 
pregnant women.  The use of tofacitinib during pregnancy is contraindicated.
Guidance against the use of tofacitinib during pregnancy is provided in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (Section 4.6). There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies on the use of tofacitinib in pregnant women. Even 
though the use of tofacitinib during pregnancy is contraindicated, all 
pregnancies can’t be prevented.  Therefore, effects on pregnancy and the 
foetus will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance and OTIS registry.

The secondary 
objectives are to:
1. Describe 
prescribing patterns 
over time; and
2. To describe changes 
in the utilisation of 
tofacitinib following 
the updated 
recommendations and 
limitations for use 
implemented after the 
2019 Article 20 
referral and the 2021 
signal evaluation 
procedure, 
specifically:
• Use in patients with 
VTE risk factors;
• Use in the elderly 
(patients aged 65 years 
and older);
• Use in patients with 
CV risk factors; and
• Use in patients with 
malignancy risk 
factors
To further understand 
and characterise the 
safety profile of 
tofacitinib within the 
clinical practice 
setting.
Safety concerns 
addressed include 
venous 
thromboembolism 
(DVT/PE), serious 
infections, HZ 
reactivation, NMSC, 
malignancy (including 
lymphoma and lung 
cancer), MACE, MI,
GI perforation, PML, 
all-cause mortality, 
fractures, higher 
incidence and severity 
of incidence of
adverse events in 
elderly patients (≥65 
years) including 
infections.

The research question is: 
Is there evidence that 
prescribers in the EU are 
compliant with the 
recommendations and 
limitations for use 
described in the 
tofacitinib aRMM 
materials?
The primary objectives 
are to:
1. Describe the 
characteristics of patients 
treated with tofacitinib, 
stratified by study 
country (i.e., Sweden,
Hungary, the Netherlands 
and Germany) and 
indication (i.e., RA, PsA, 
and UC; off-label 
indications), in terms of:
• Demographics (e.g., 
age, sex); and

2. Evaluate prescribers’ 
adherence to the 
tofacitinib aRMMs, 
specifically:
• Compliance to the 
recommended posology 
per indication (average 
daily dose) and duration 
of use;
• Compliance to patient 
screening and laboratory 
monitoring prior to and 
during tofacitinib 
treatment; and
• Compliance to 
recommendations for 
limitations of use, 
including:
• Use in patients with 
VTE risk factors;
• Use in patients aged 
65 years and older;
• Use in patients with 
CV risk factors; 
• Use in patients with 
malignancy risk 
factors;
• Contraindicated use; 
and
• Use with concomitant 
medications not 
compatible with 
tofacitinib.
The secondary objectives 
are to:
1. Describe prescribing 
patterns over time; and
2. To describe changes in 
the utilisation of 
tofacitinib following the 
updated 
recommendations and 
limitations for use 
implemented after the 
2019 Article 20 referral

V.2. Additional Risk Minimisation Measures
Patient Alert Card
Objectives:
The objective of the proposed additional measure is to provide an appropriate tool designed 
to enhance the awareness and knowledge of patients about the following safety concerns and 
to ensure the optimal use of tofacitinib.
 Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE)
 Serious and other important infections  
 Herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation
 Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC)
 Transaminase elevation and potential for potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
 Myocardial infarction
 Malignancy excluding NMSC
 Lung cancer
 Lymphoma
Page 245
 Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation



Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
Increased immunosuppression when used in combination with biologics and 
immunosuppressants including B-lymphocyte depleting agents
Increased risk of AEs when tofacitinib is administered in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX) in RA or PsA
 Effects on pregnancy and the foetus
 Use in breastfeeding
 Effect on vaccination efficacy and the use of live/attenuated vaccines
 That patients 65 years of age and older should only use tofacitinib if no suitable treatment 
alternatives are available
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:
Additional awareness and knowledge of patients about the risk will help to mitigate this risk.
Target audience and planned distribution path:
The target audience is patients via their prescribing physicians. The communication plan 
varies by local legal and regulatory requirements.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:
Routine pharmacovigilance activities to identify new safety signals and monitor reporting 
trends.  Observational data sources (eg, prescriber survey and drug utilisation study) will be 
used to evaluate overall RMM effectiveness.
Risk Minimisation Measures (RMMs) are judged effective if no negative trends or worsening 
outcomes are identified.

Objectives:
The objective of the proposed additional measure is to provide an appropriate tool designed 
to enhance the awareness and knowledge of prescribers and patients about the following 
safety concerns and to ensure the optimal use of tofacitinib. 
To accomplish the objective, Prescriber Information Pack was developed to inform 
prescribers about the risks and provide recommendations on how to mitigate the risk through 
appropriate monitoring and management.
 Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE)
 Serious and other important infections  
 HZ reactivation
 Decrease in Hgb levels and anaemia
 NMSC
 Transaminase elevation and potential for potential for DILI
 Cardiovascular risk (excl MI)
 MI
 Malignancy (excluding NMSC)
 Lymphoma 
 Lung cancer
 GI Perforation

ILD
 All-cause mortality


Increased immunosuppression when used in combination with biologics and 
immunosuppressants including B-lymphocyte depleting agents
Increased risk of AEs when tofacitinib is administered in combination with MTX in RA 
or PsA
 Primary viral infection following live vaccination
Page 247
 Higher incidence and severity of AEs in the elderly (≥65 years) including serious 
infections, myocardial infarction, malignancies, and all-cause mortality and that 
tofacitinib should only be used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available
 Effects on pregnancy and the foetus
 Use in breastfeeding
 Effect on vaccination efficacy and the use of live/attenuated vaccines
 Use in RA patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:
Additional awareness and knowledge of physicians about the risks help to mitigate the risks.
Target audience and planned distribution path:
The target audience is prescribing physicians. The communication plan varies by local legal 
and regulatory requirements.  A DHPC was also used to inform prescribers of the risk of 
venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) and recommendation for patients 65 years of age and 
older, tofacitinib should only be considered if no suitable treatment alternatives are available 
due to the increased risk of serious infections.  A second DHPC was disseminated to inform 
prescribers about the outcome of the signal procedure assessment.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:
Routine PV activities to identify new safety signals and monitor reporting trends.  
Observational data sources (eg, prescriber survey and drug utilisation study) will be used to 
evaluate overall RMM effectiveness.
RMMs are judged effective, if no negative trends or worsening outcomes are identified from 
the registry studies.  In addition, effectiveness of the aRMMs communication of the key risk 
messages associated with the use of tofacitnib to HCPs will be studied in the European 
prescriber survey.  The European drug utilisation study will evaluate if there is evidence that 
prescribers in Europe are compliant with the recommendations and limitations for use 
described in the tofacitinib aRMM materials.
Prescriber Checklist
Objectives:
The objective of the proposed additional measure is to provide an appropriate tool designed 
to enhance the awareness and knowledge of prescribers about the safety concerns and to 
ensure the optimal use of tofacitinib. 
Page 248
To accomplish the objective, 2 treatment checklists: initiation checklist and maintenance 
checklists, were developed to be used prior to and during tofacitinib treatment.  They intend 
to remind the prescriber of the risks associated with use of tofacitinib and the recommended 
tests before and during the tofacitinib treatment.
 Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE)
 Serious and other important infections  
 Decrease in Hgb levels and anaemia
 Transaminase elevation and potential for potential for DILI
 Cardiovascular risk (excl MI)
 MI
 Malignancy

 Primary viral infection following live vaccination
 Effects on pregnancy and the foetus

 Effect on vaccination efficacy and the use of live/attenuated vaccines
 Use in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment
 The existing key element of “relevant comorbidities for which caution is advised when 
tofacitinib is administered and conditions in which tofacitinib should not be 
administered” includes details on the patients at risk for MACE/MI and malignancy 
events (i.e., to avoid use of tofacitinib in patients 65 years of age and older, patients who 
Page 249
are current or past long-time smokers, and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors 
or patients with risk factors for malignancies).  
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:
The rationale of the proposed additional measures is that additional awareness and 
knowledge of prescribers about the risks will help to mitigate this risk.
Target audience and planned distribution path:
The target audience is prescribing physicians. The communication plan varies by local legal 
and regulatory requirements.  A DHPC was also used to inform prescribers of the risk of 
venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) and consideration for use in patients >65 years of age.  
A second DHPC was disseminated to inform prescribers about the outcome of the signal 
procedure assessment.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:
Routine PV activities to identify new safety signals and monitor reporting trends.  
Observational data sources (eg, prescriber survey and drug utilisation study) will be used to 
evaluate overall RMM effectiveness.

prescriber survey.  The European drug utilisation study will evaluate if there is evidence that 
prescribers in Europe are compliant with the recommendations and limitations for use 
described in the tofacitinib aRMM materials.

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
This is a summary of the RMP for XELJANZ.  The RMP details important risks of 
XELJANZ, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about XELJANZ’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
XELJANZ’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how XELJANZ should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for XELJANZ should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
XELJANZ’s RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
XELJANZ is authorised for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, 
active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis, and 
ankylosing spondylitis (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains tofacitinib citrate as the 
active substance and it is given by oral route of administration.
Further information about the evaluation of XELJANZ’s benefits can be found in 
XELJANZ’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xeljanz 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of XELJANZ, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about XELJANZ’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly
Page 268
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of XELJANZ, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of XELJANZ is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of XELJANZ are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of XELJANZ. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important Identified Risk: Venous thromboembolic events (DVT/PE)
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and 
risk groups
Venous thromboembolism was observed at an increased and dose-dependent incidence 
in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors in Study A3921133 
(patients with RA aged 50 years and older with at least one CV risk factor).  No 
differential risk factors were identified for the increased risk relative to TNF inhibitors.
Numerous VTE risk factors are known in the general population.  These known VTE 
risk factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, 
myocardial infarction (within previous 3 months), heart failure, use of combined 
hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, inherited coagulation 
disorder, malignancy. Additional VTE risk factors such as age, obesity (body mass 
index [BMI] ≥30), diabetes, hypertension, smoking status should also be considered.
Pediatric JIA patients can experience many of the risk factors seen in adults. In a 
review article it is noted that in children aged 2 to <18 years with JIA, cardiovascular 
risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and being less physically active are 
more frequent than in their healthy peers.  JIA patients may also have other 
cardiovascular risk factors seen in adult RA such as obesity, diabetes, and smoking. 
JIA patients potentially could have other risk factors (e.g., adolescent contraceptive 
hormone use, major surgeries, immobilization, congenital and acquired 
thrombophilias), which may increase their risk of such events.  Published literature 
suggest a higher prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies positive, or elevated levels of 
coagulation factors in JIA patients compared with non-JIA patients; however, these 
findings were not correlated with clinical features such as abnormal clotting test or 
anticardiolipin antibody syndrome.  Data also suggest an increased risk of malignancy 
among JIA patients compared with non-JIA patients. In a retrospective cohort study 
based in the Swedish Cancer Register, the HR (95% CI) for all pediatric malignancies 
in JIA vs the general population was 1.43 (0.71-2.88).   
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The overall number 
of VTE events in the tofacitinib group with moderate-to-severe disease was small and 
the rate [0.18 (0.04, 0.51)] was similar to the bDMARD group [0.32 (0.20, 0.47)].  The

activities
risk factors associated with VTE were generally similar between tofacitinib and 
bDMARD groups and were consistent with the known risk factors for VTE (e.g., 
advanced age).  In patients with moderate-to-severe disease aged 50 years and older 
with at least one CV risk factor, the crude incidence rate (95% CI) was 0.22 (0.03, 
0.78) in tofacitinib initiators compared with 0.51 (0.31, 0.80) for bDMARDs initiators.

Risk factors/groups for serious infections include patients who are elderly or diabetic, 
patients that use drugs along with tofacitinib that suppress the immune system 
(including corticosteroids), patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts in their 
blood, and patients from certain Asian countries.
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The risk factors 
associated with serious infection events were similar between tofacitinib and 
bDMARD groups in patients with moderate-to-severe disease (such as history of 
hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, age 70+, age 60+).  The rates of serious 
infection events were higher without overlapping 95% CI in patients 65 and older than

There is a higher rate of herpes zoster in Japanese and Korean patients.  Patients who 
have had rheumatoid arthritis for many years, were elderly or have previously used 
two or more medicines that depress the immune system, including so called targeted 
biologic (antibody) therapies, such as those that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and 
corticosteroids also have an increased risk.  Patients with a low white blood cell

In the RA programme, NMSC primarily occurred in sun-exposed areas of the body 
including the face/head and hands.  The commonly reported risk factors of NMSC 
include sun exposure (i.e., ultraviolet), medications that suppress the immune system, 
light therapy, virus infections (eg, human papilloma virus), age, and certain types of 
radiation.
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA 
who were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk 
factor, an increased incidence of malignancies excluding NMSC, particularly lung 
cancer, lymphoma, and an increase in NMSC was observed with tofacitinib compared

Table 155. Summary of Important Risks and Missing Information 
incidence of malignancies particularly NMSC, lung cancer and lymphoma, was 
observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  The  following predictive 
factors for development of malignancies excluding NMSC were identified using a 
Multivariate Cox model with backward selection: age ≥65 years and current or past 
smoking.
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The rates of 
malignancy excluding NMSC were higher without overlapping 95% CI in patients 65 
and older than in patients younger than 65 in both tofacitinib and bDMARD initiator 
groups.  The rate of malignancy excluding NMSC in patients 65 and older in 
tofacitinib initiators was 1.77 (95%CI=1.17, 2.57) and the rate in bDMARD initiators 
was 1.22 (95% CI=0.95, 1.55); the 95% CI overlapped.
Summary of Study A3921133 results: an increase in malignancies (excluding NMSC), 
particularly lymphoma and lung cancer, was observed with tofacitinib compared to 
TNFi. This increased risk was predominantly observed in older patients and in patients 
who are current or past smokers.  
The IR per 100 PY (95% CI) (based on total time) of adjudicated malignancies 
(excluding NMSC) in adults aged ≥65 years or who had ever smoked for the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All Tofa, and TNFi groups, respectively, 
were 1.38 (1.01, 1.82), 1.59 (1.19, 2.07), 1.48 (1.21, 1.80), and 0.96 (0.66, 1.34).  
In patients who were less than 65 years of age and had never smoked, the IR per 100 
PY (95% CI) (based on total time) for malignancies excluding NMSC for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, All Tofa, and TNFi groups, respectively, were 0.70 
(0.38, 1.17), 0.31 (0.12, 0.68), 0.51 (0.31, 0.79), and 0.44 (0.20, 0.84).

Important Potential Risk: All-cause mortality
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and 
risk groups
Mortality in patients treated with tofacitinib was mainly due to cardiovascular events, 
infections, and malignancies.  Risk factors/groups for serious infections include 
patients who are elderly or diabetic, patients that use drugs along with tofacitinib that 
suppress the immune system (including corticosteroids), patients with low absolute 
lymphocyte counts, and patients from certain Asian countries.  The risk of 
cardiovascular events in general is increased in the elderly population.  Tofacitinib has 
been associated with increased cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), and 
weight gain, which are known risk factors for cardiovascular events.  The risk of 
malignancy (cancer) in general is increased in the elderly population.  There are no 
known tofacitinib-associated risk factors for malignancy (cancer).  
In Study A3921133, a randomised post authorisation safety study in patients with RA 
who were 50 years of age or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk 
factor, an increase in non-fatal MI, lung cancer, lymphoma, VTE, and NMSC was 
observed in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitor.  
Summary of results from the US Corrona RA Registry A3921205: The risk factors 
found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality events were in general 
similar among tofacitinib initiators and bDMARD initiators with moderate-to-severe 
disease (such as history of hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, history of 
VTE, age 70+, age 60+).  In patients aged 50 years and older with moderate-to-severe 
disease with at least one CV risk factor, the incidence rates (95% CI) were comparable 
among tofacitinib initiators and bDMARD initiators.

 Category 3 (required additional pharmacovigilance activities): 17
 Study A3921321 is an EU-based drug utilisation study using electronic health care 
records.  The research question is: Is there evidence that prescribers in the EU are 
compliant with the recommendations and limitations for use described in the 
tofacitinib aRMM materials?  The primary objectives include 1. Describe the 
characteristics of patients treated with tofacitinib, stratified by study country (i.e., 
Sweden, Hungary, the Netherlands and Germany) and indication (i.e., RA, PsA, and 
UC; off-label indications), in terms of demographics (e.g., age, sex) and 
comorbidities and prior and current medication use.  2. Evaluate prescribers’ 
adherence to the tofacitinib aRMMs, specifically compliance to the recommended 
posology per indication (average daily dose) and duration of use; compliance to 
patient screening and laboratory monitoring prior to and during tofacitinib treatment; 
and compliance to recommendations for limitations of use, including use in patients 
with VTE risk factors, use in patients aged 65 years and older, use in patients with 
CV risk factors, use in patients with malignancy risk factors, contraindicated use, and 
use with concomitant medications not compatible with tofacitinib.  The secondary 
objectives are to 1. Describe prescribing patterns over time; and 2. To describe 
changes in the utilisation of tofacitinib following the updated recommendations and 
limitations for use implemented after the 2019 Article 20 referral and the 2021 signal 
evaluation procedure, specifically: use in patients with VTE risk factors; use in the 
elderly (patients aged 65 years and older), use in patients with CV risk factors, and 
use in patients with malignancy risk factors.

ANNEX 6. DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES (IF APPLICABLE)
Approved key messages of the additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of XELJANZ in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the 
content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National 
Competent Authority. The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where 
XELJANZ is marketed, healthcare professionals who intend to prescribe XELJANZ 
have been provided with an educational package.
The main objective of the programme is to increase awareness about the risks of the 
product, specifically in regards to all-cause mortality, serious infections, venous 
thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]), 
cardiovascular risk (excluding myocardial infarction [MI]), MI, herpes zoster, 
tuberculosis (TB) and other opportunistic infections, malignancy (particularly 
lymphoma and lung cancer), NMSC, gastrointestinal perforations, interstitial lung 
disease, and laboratory abnormalities.
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where XELJANZ is marketed, all 
healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe or use XELJANZ 
have access to/are provided with the following educational package:
 Physician educational material 
 Patient information pack
 The physician educational material should contain:
o The Summary of Product Characteristics
o Guide for healthcare professionals
o Prescriber checklist
o Patient alert card
o A reference to the website with the educational material and patient alert card
 The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements:
o Relevant information of the safety concerns addressed by the aRMM (e.g. 
seriousness, severity, frequency, time to onset, reversibility of the AE as 
applicable)
o Details of the population at higher risk for the safety concern addressed by the 
aRMM (i.e. contraindications, risk factors, increased risk by interactions with 
certain medicine)
o Details of the populations at higher risk for VTE, cardiovascular risk including 
MI, and malignancy (including lymphoma and lung cancer)
o Details on use of XELJANZ in patients 65 years of age and older, including 
information on the specific risks in this population (e.g. serious infections, 
Page 1
Page 317
myocardial infarction, malignancy, all-cause mortality), and details on how to 
minimise the risks of tofacitinib in patients 65 years of age and older in clinical 
practice, i.e. the recommendation that tofacitinib should only be used in patients 
65 years of age and older if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. 
o Details on how to minimise the safety concerns addressed by the aRMM through 
appropriate monitoring and management (i.e. who may receive the medicine, 
what to do, what not do, and who is most likely be impacted according to 
different scenarios, like when to limit or stop prescribing/ingestion, how to 
administer the medicine, when to increase/decrease the dose according to 
laboratory measurements, signs and symptoms)
o Details on how to minimise the risks of VTE, cardiovascular risk including MI, 
and malignancy (including lymphoma, lung cancer and NMSC) in clinical 
practice, i.e.: 
o VTE: Tofacitinib should be used with caution in patients with known VTE 
risk factors.
o MACE and MI: In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are 
current or past long-time smokers and patients with history of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, 
tofacitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available.
o Malignancies: In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are 
current or past long-time smokers and patients with other malignancy risk 
factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy other than a 
successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer), tofacitinib should only be 
used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
o Posology UC maintenance treatment: Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily is not 
recommended for maintenance treatment in patients with UC who have 
known VTE, MACE and malignancy risk factors, unless there is no 
suitable alternative treatment available.
o Key message to convey in patients counselling 
o Instructions on how to handle possible adverse events
o Information about the BSRBR, ARTIS, RABBIT, BIODABASER, UC registries, 
and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
registries and the importance of contributing to these
o Vaccination course to be completed before treatment as it is recommended that 
live vaccines not be given concurrently with tofacitinib
 The Prescriber checklist shall contain the following key messages:
o Lists of tests to be conducted during the initial screening and maintenance of the 
patient
o Vaccination course to be completed before treatment
o A specific reference to the fact that the patient has been informed and understands 
that tofacitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast-feeding and 
women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during 
treatment with tofacitinib and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose

o That the benefit risk of tofacitinib should be discussed with the patient, and the 
patient alert card should be given to and discussed with the patient
o Relevant comorbidities for which caution is advised when XELJANZ is 
administered and conditions in which XELJANZ should not be administered
o Guidance to minimise the risk of cardiovascular events including MI and 
malignancy (lymphoma, lung cancer, and NMSC), i.e.:
o MACE and MI: In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are 
current or past long-time smokers and patients with history of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, 
tofacitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available.
o Malignancies: In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are 
current or past long-time smokers and patients with other malignancy risk 
factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy other than a 
successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer), tofacitinib should only be 
in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
o Guidance that in patients 65 years of age and older tofacitinib should only
be used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.
o List of concomitant medications which are not compatible with treatment with 
XELJANZ
o The need to discuss with the patients the risks associated with the use of 
XELJANZ, specifically in regards to all-cause mortality, infections, venous 
thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]), 
cardiovascular risk (excluding MI), MI, herpes zoster, tuberculosis (TB) and other 
opportunistic infections, malignancy (including lymphoma and lung cancer), 
gastrointestinal perforations, interstitial lung disease, and laboratory abnormalities
o The need to monitor for any signs and symptoms and laboratory abnormalities for 
early identification of the abovementioned risks 
 The Patient alert card shall contain the following key messages: 
o A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in 
conditions of emergency, that the patient is using XELJANZ
o That treatment with XELJANZ may increase the risk of infections, malignancies 
(including lung cancer, lymphoma), and non-melanoma skin cancer
o That patients should inform health professionals if they are planning to receive 
any vaccine or become pregnant
o Signs or symptoms of the following safety concern and/or when to seek attention 
from a HCP: infections, venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] 
and pulmonary embolism [PE]), myocardial infarction (MI), herpes zoster 
reactivation, malignancies (including lung cancer, lymphoma), non-melanoma 
skin cancer, transaminase elevation and potential for drug-induced liver injury, 
gastrointestinal perforation, interstitial lung disease, increased 
immunosuppression when used in combination with biologics and 
immunosuppressants including B lymphocyte depleting agents, increased risk of 
adverse events when XELJANZ is administered in combination with MTX,

effects on pregnancy and foetus, use in breast-feeding, effect on vaccination 
efficacy and the use of live/attenuated vaccines.
o Contact details of the prescriber 
 The website repository shall contain: 
o The educational material in digital format
o The patient alert card in digital format
 The patient information pack should contain:
o Patient information leaflet

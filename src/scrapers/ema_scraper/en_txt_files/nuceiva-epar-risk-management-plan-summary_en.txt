Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for NUCEIVA (Botulinum Toxin Type A) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for NUCEIVA. The RMP details important risks 
of NUCEIVA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
NUCEIVA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
NUCEIVA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how NUCEIVA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for NUCEIVA should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of NUCEIVA’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
NUCEIVA is authorised for the treatment of complicated glabellar lines in adults (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains Botulinum Toxin Type A as the active substance and it is injected using a sterile 
needle in each of the 5 injection sites: 2 injections in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior 
medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle. 
Further information about the evaluation of NUCEIVA’s benefits can be found in NUCEIVA’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
<Pre-authorisation RMP (this line should be only edited by EMA): link to the EPAR summary landing 
page. > 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of NUCEIVA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about NUCEIVA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine 
is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These 
measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of NUCEIVA is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of NUCEIVA are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of NUCEIVA. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
No occurrences of incorrect drug administration due to 100U vial were 
observed in the EVOLUS pre-registration clinical development programme. 
However, it cannot be excluded that incorrect drug administration will not 
occur due to the approved indications for other Botulinum toxin Type A 
products and publicly reported use of single-use vials of other Botulinum 
toxin Type A products into multiple patients1.

microbiological point of view, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and

Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
NUCEIVA. 
II.C.2 
Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
A non-interventional PASS will be conducted. Its objective will be to provide additional characterisation 
of the long-term safety of Nuceiva. The study protocol will include the systematic recording of previous 
exposure to botulinum toxin A. 
Retesting of previously negative sera from studies EV-001, EV-002, EV-004, EV006 will be undertaken 
using alternative binding Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) assays for screening, confirmation and 
determination of ADA titres, supported by a sensitive assay for neutralising ADA. 
Upon receipt of any product complaint regarding lack of response, EVOLUS will contact the treating 
physician and offer blood sample testing for neutralising antibodies (NAb), to be organised and funded by 
Evolus. The testing will be performed using validated NAb detection method (recognizing that they may 
have already had pre-existing NAb to botulinum toxin before exposure to NUCEIVA). Results of the 
testing will be provided back to the treating physician, factored into routine signal detection and reported 
in PSURs. 
Lastly, a 50U vial size has been developed and approval is being sought to replace the 100U vial to reduce 
the potential risk of incorrect drug administration (misuse) due to 100U vial administration.

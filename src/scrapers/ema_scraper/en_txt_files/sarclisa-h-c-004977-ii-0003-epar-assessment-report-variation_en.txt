2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
SARCLISA is indicated: 
- in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior therapies including 
lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy. 
This EoI is to include the combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Epidemiology  
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 10% of all haematological malignancies. The incidence in Europe is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 7/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5-6/100.000/year with a median age at diagnosis between 65 and 70 years.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The cause of a myeloma cell’s failure to differentiate is unknown. However, translocations between 
chromosome 14q32 and its neighbours (involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain region) and 
deregulation of the c-myc oncogene appear to play a role in the initial stages of the disease; additionally, 
mutations in N-Ras and K-Ras are seen in up to 15% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Conversely, 
mutations in p53 are rarely seen at diagnosis but instead are noted in extramedullary relapses, along 
with phenotypic and cytological changes. With the exception of chromosome 13q deletions, which are 
consistently associated with a poor prognosis, the role of other changes in the pathogenesis and severity 
of the disease have yet to be defined. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage 
The clinical features of MM are varied and can arise from the effects of the tumour itself, or the toxicity of 
the tumour products, or the host's own immune response. 
The most common symptoms include persistent skeletal pain (especially pain in the back or thorax), 
pathological fractures and vertebral collapse, anaemia, renal impairment, hypercalcaemia and recurrent 
or persistent bacterial infections. Approximately 20% of patients are asymptomatic at the time of 
diagnosis. 
The most common criteria used in diagnosis of symptomatic MM are the presence of ≥10% clonal BM 
plasma cells or biopsy proven bony or extramedullary plasmacytoma; paraprotein (M protein) in the 
serum and/or urine; and evidence of related organ or tissue impairment due to plasma cell disorder.  
Prognostic factors that have been identified to predict the heterogeneity in survival are: serum ß2-
microglobulin, albumin, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, the genetic 
abnormalities t(4;14), deletion(17p), t(14;16) and chromosome 1 abnormalities are mostly associated 
with a poorer outcome. The International Staging System (ISS) relies on the combination of the level of 
serum ß2-microglobulin and albumin in 3 different stages with  ISS 3 being associated with the poorest 
outcome. The ISS was revised by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) in 20151 to include 
cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This revised 
ISS (R-ISS) is now widely accepted. At the time of diagnosis, patients are typically categorised according 
to R-ISS, their age, comorbidity and their suitability for intensive treatment.  
In general, the disease is characterised by a chronic phase lasting several years, and an aggressive 
terminal phase. Almost all patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who survive initial treatment will 
eventually relapse and require further therapy. Progress has been made over the last 15 years in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma, such that survival of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
has increased from approximately 3 years from the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years 
(Moreau 2015). 
First line treatment options contain at least one of the novel therapies, i.e. proteasome inhibitors and/or 
immunomodulatory drugs, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), if indicated. Depth of 
response after autologous transplantation appears to correlate with the duration of disease control until 
disease progression with the need for salvage therapy. Although second and later remissions can be 
achieved with further therapy, myeloma typically reappears more aggressively after each relapse, leading 
to decreased duration of response and culminating in treatment-refractory disease with short survival 
times.

The treatment landscape for patients with RRMM is rapidly changing following the recent approval of 
several second generation medicinal products and products belonging to novel classes of agents and the 
use of multidrug combinations of two, three and sometimes even 4 different products. Current treatment 
regiments for MM include glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone), 
chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, including high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous 
stem cell transplantation (ASCT), proteasome inhibitors (PIs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib and 
ixazomib), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs, such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and 
the monoclonal antibody (mAbs) directed at cell surface markers (daratumumab, elotuzumab and 
isatuximab). 
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior  
treatment  lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse (i.e. clinical versus biochemical relapse). In young patients, a second ASCT may be 
considered, provided that the patient responded well to the previous ASCT and had a PFS of more than 
24 months. 
The most commonly used regimens in the relapsed/refractory setting are proteasome inhibitor- or 
lenalidomide-containing regimens. Recently approved treatment regiments for MM who have received at 
least one prior therapy include the combinations of carfilzomib/lenalidimide/dexamethasone (approval in 
2016) and carfilzomib/dexamethasone (approval in 2016), elotuzumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone 
(approval in 2016), daratumumab/lenalidomide/dexamathasome (approval in 2017), 
daratumumab/bortezomib/dexamethasone (approval in 2017), pomalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone 
(approval in 2019). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Isatuximab (SAR650984, hu38SB19) is an IgG1-derived monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific 
extracellular epitope of CD38 receptor. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on 
plasma cells. It is both an enzyme, able to catalyze the formation of nucleotide metabolites involved in 
calcium signalling, and a receptor, which induces cell signalling through interaction with other receptors 
at the surface of the cell. The CD38 receptor is involved in the homeostasis of the hematopoietic 
compartment as a modulator of cell survival and differentiation. 
The CD38 antigen is expressed in several haematological malignancies of B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, 
and myeloid origin. Moreover, CD38 was identified as a negative prognostic marker in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Thus, mAbs directed at CD38 are potentially effective as treatment of 
various hematological malignancies, MM, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHLs), acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
In vitro, isatuximab acts through IgG Fc-dependent mechanisms including: antibody dependent cell 
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Furthermore, isatuximab can also trigger tumor cell death by induction of 
apoptosis via an Fc-independent mechanism. In vitro, isatuximab blocks the enzymatic activity of CD38 
which catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a calcium mobilising agent. 
Isatuximab inhibits the cADPR production from extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in 
MM cells. In vitro, isatuximab can activate NK cells in the absence of CD38 positive target tumour cells. In 
vivo, a decrease in absolute counts of total CD16+ and CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD4+ T-cells and 
TREG (CD3+, CD4+, CD25+, CD127-) was observed in peripheral blood of patients treated with 
isatuximab monotherapy. In MM patients, isatuximab monotherapy induced clonal expansion of the T-cell 
receptor repertoire indicating an adaptive immune response.

Isatuximab is approved in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior 
therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and have demonstrated disease 
progression on the last therapy. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Data to support the current application for the use of isatuximab 
- in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple 
myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
comes from one pivotal phase III study (EFC15246) and 3 additional studies to support the combination 
with dexamethasone or carfilzomib. The design of the pivotal study, comparator arm, isatuximab dose, 
randomisation, and endpoints were discussed and agreed in scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2998/1/FU/3/2017/PA/II, EMEA/H/SA/2998/1/FU/2/2017/PA/III).  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted (please see Discussion on Non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a claim of exclusion from submission of environmental risk assessment studies 
according to Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (ERA Guideline corr. 2) as isatuximab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of 
linked naturally occurring amino acids and its use is unlikely to alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, the mAb is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
This is agreed and no environmental risk assessment would be required.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of isatuximab have been characterised in the clinical development program to date across multiple 
studies in MM patients with diverse demographic characteristics. In the original submission, isatuximab 
was approved for the treatment in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Ipd). Isatuximab 
was administered by IV infusion over the dose range of 0.0001 to 20 mg/kg as Q2W, QW, QW/Q2W, or 
Q2W/Q4W loading/maintenance regimens. The PK of isatuximab are characterised by parallel linear 
(time-dependent) and nonlinear Michaelis-Menten (concentration-dependent) elimination pathways.  
In the current submission, the applicant is seeking approval of isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib 
(Kyprolis) and dexamethasone , so called IKd combination, for the treatment of patients with MM who 
have received at least one prior therapy, based on the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC15246. PK has been 
studied in the Phase III study (EFC15246) in addition to the studies submitted in the initial MAA.  
The proposed dosing regimen is the same as for isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (IPd): 10 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) once weekly (QW) for the first cycle (28 
days; 4 once-weekly administrations), and every 2 weeks (Q2W) thereafter (QW/Q2W). The proposed 
drug product is a concentrate for solution for infusion at a concentration of 20 mg/mL.

Pop-PK model isatuximab (POH0630) 
The objectives of this analysis were to provide individual PK and exposure parameter estimates of 
isatuximab for the 172 patients who received 10 mg QW/Q2W and were included in the interim analysis 
of Study EFC15246, and for further PK/PD analyses and to investigate the PK sources of variability. 
Methods 
The final population PK (PPK) model developed in POH0503 (from studies TED10893, TCD14079, 
TED14154 and EFC14335 in a total of 476 patients) was used to perform an empirical Bayesian 
estimation and to derive empirical Bayes estimates (EBE: conditional modes of the distribution) in 
patients from EFC15246. 
Individual PK parameters were generated for patients from Phase 3 study EFC15246 with a Bayesian 
method using a previously developed population PK model POH0503 (included in the original submission) 
as prior information and the concentration-time data for each patient. Briefly, this was a 2 compartment 
PK model with parallel nonlinear Michaelis-Menten (concentration-dependent) elimination and linear time-
dependent elimination (sigmoidal Emax function, where Emax is maximum effect) from the central 
compartment. In the model, linear CL at steady state was significantly related to β2 microglobulin, body 
weight, and Ig MM type (IgG versus non-IgG) whereas central volume of distribution was found to be 
related to body weight, gender, material (isatuximab P1F1 versus isatuximab P2F2) and race (Asian 
versus non-Asian). 
The analysis was performed using the SAEM algorithm for nonlinear mixed-effects models implemented in 
MONOLIX software (Version 2019R1). 
Graphical and statistical analyses were then performed in order to identify potentially influential 
covariates on posterior individual Ctrough values at the end of 4 weeks (CT4W), the best PK predictor for 
efficacy. The continuous covariates at baseline tested were age, body surface area, body weight, body 
mass index (BMI), serum albumin, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), β2-microglobulin, percent of plasma cells in bone marrow, serum M-protein, 
lymphocytes, and number of prior lines of treatment. Gender, race, MM International Staging System 
(ISS), serum albumin by group, performance status (ECOG), the nature of multiple myeloma disease 
including the main Ig MM type, renal and hepatic impairment grades, and obesity were explored as 
categorical covariates at baseline. 
Model validation  
Figure 1 illustrates the agreement between individual observed plasma concentrations vs individual 
predicted plasma concentrations whereas the lack of trend in Figure 2 and Figure 3 (IWRES vs time and 
predictions, respectively) show that the structural model and especially the time-dependency, as 
implemented in POH0503, was able to describe what happened in EFC15246 on an individual basis. In 
addition, all individual fittings indicate that different kind of profiles could be described by the POH0503 
model.

Results 
PK in the target population   
In study EFC15246, isatuximab PK were evaluated in 172 patients; however, only 166 predose 
concentrations were included in the descriptive statistics of Ctrough because 5 predose samples were in 
fact collected in the 30 minutes following the start of infusion and one patient had no predose sample.

Relative to Cycle 1 Day 8 (1st administration), accumulation based on the observed trough concentration 
(Ctrough) was 4.25- and 4.18-fold for Cycle 2 Day 1 (5th administration, N=130) and Cycle 4 Day 1 (9th 
administration, N=137), respectively. Relative to Cycle 1 Day 1 (1st administration), accumulation based 
on the concentration at the end of infusion (Ceoi) was 1.96-fold for Cycle 2 Day 1 (5th administration, 
N=130). Further PK parameters for isatuximab in the combination with carfilzomib/dexamethasome were 
predicted in pop-PK analysis below.   
Pop-PK analysis isatuximab (Report POH0630) 
In the IKd population, isatuximab exhibited a low linear mean clearance at steady state ([CL], 0.00426 
L/h [55.0%]) (i.e. 0.102 L/day) and low volume of distribution of the central compartment ([V1], 3.07 L 
[30.7%]) and peripheral compartment ([V2], 3.41 L [56.7%]). The median decrease in linear CL was 
approximately 40%. The approximate median time to reach half of this decrease was 5.5 weeks, with a 
slower kinetics of decrease in patients secreting clonal IgG compared to patients secreting other types of 
Ig. The mean (percent coefficient of variation [CV%]) half-life associated with the linear elimination at 
steady-state was 53.6 (42.1%) days. The mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC2weeks at steady state (Cycle 6) 
were 655 μg/mL (30.8%) and 159 000 μg•h/mL (37.1%), respectively, in the IKd Phase 3 study 
EFC15246 (N=172; see Table 1).

Comparison with IPd (isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone) 
The mean Cmax (259 μg/mL) and AUC1week (21 400 μg•h/mL) after the first administration in subjects 
treated with IKd were approximately 1.35- and 1.42-fold higher, respectively, than those in the approved 
indication (EFC14335; N=148). The difference increased to approximately to 1.87- to 2.19-fold for the 
Cmax and AUC2weeks, respectively, at steady state (Cycle 6) (Table 1). 
The potential reasons (ie, bioanalytical methods, patient characteristics, and response over time) for this 
difference between IKd and IPd populations were explored as described hereafter (see discussion).  
Figure 5. Comparison of AUC1week (mean±SD) after the first administration at 10 mg/kg across clinial 
studies.  
Besides the assay method differences, the differences in patient populations were also considered 
because study EFC15246 had patients with less advanced disease status with slightly higher serum 
Assessment report

albumin levels at baseline, slightly lower serum M-Protein levels at baseline, β2 microglobulin levels at 
baseline, and LDH level at baseline, a lower percent of plasma cells in bone marrow, and fewer patients at 
ISS Stage III, ECOG Performance Status 2, and aged ≥75 years at baseline, compared to EFC14335. To 
assess the contribution of patient characteristics at baseline on PK differences between the two Phase 3 
studies EFC14335 and EFC15246, matched analyses were conducted for exposure parameters after the 
first isatuximab administration, when no impact of the treatment is expected, as well as at 4 weeks. 
Different case control analyses were performed adjusting for covariates included in the population PK 
model using nearest neighbor matching from EFC14335 based on Mahanalobis distance. ‘Matched 
EFC15246 patients’ were patients from study EFC15246 who matched with EFC14335 patients’ 
characteristics for the following baseline covariates: Ig MM type, body weight, β2 microglobulin, serum 
albumin, and ISS stage. As it was a match with replacement, a patient from study EFC15246 could have 
been counted several times in the matched study EFC15246 population if it happened that he/she was the 
nearest one from several patients from study EFC14335. 
Absorption 
As shown in Table 2, the mean AUC1week for the IKd study EFC15246 was closer to the corresponding 
mean value for the IPd study EFC14335 after the matching, but not enough to fully explain the difference 
observed between the two studies by differences in patients characteristics. The matched analysis also 
showed a bigger difference in isatuximab exposure after repeated administration, as demonstrated by the 
85% higher CT4W in study EFC15246 compared to study EFC14335. This increase in the exposure 
difference over time is attributed to a higher proportion of responders, especially VGPR+ patients, in 
study EFC15246 than in study EFC14335 (ORR: 86.6% versus 60.4%; VGPR+: 72.6% versus 31.8%), 
acknowledging that the relative difference (expressed as mean, median, or geometric mean ratio) in 
exposure (CT4W and AUC2weeks) between responders and non-responders appeared to be of the same 
magnitude for both IKd and IPd populations (Table 3). Consistent between the two studies, isatuximab 
CL decreases (and exposure increases) over time in patients who respond to isatuximab treatment; this 
was interpreted in the original submission dossier as an impact of the status improvement on the PK of 
isatuximab trough by mechanisms such as reduction in inflammation and IgG M-protein, leading to a 
greater proportion of isatuximab going through salvage pathways and subsequently resulting in lower 
clearance.

Distribution/Elimination 
Similar to the IPd population in the original submission, isatuximab exhibited a low linear clearance and 
low volume of distribution in the IKd population in the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC15246 in the current 
submission. However, compared to those estimated in patients from the IPd study EFC14335, the linear 
clearance at steady state was lower (0.00426 L/h [0.102 L/day] versus 0.00822 L/h) and was associated 
with a longer terminal half-life (53.6 days versus 33.1 days), while the volumes of distribution of the 
central (V1) and peripheral (V2) compartments were comparable (V1: 3.07 versus 3.95 L; V2: 3.41 L 
versus 3.31 L) in the IKd study EFC15246. Additionally, while the distribution of CL estimates over the 
course of IKd treatment presented the same pattern for the time dependency in CL, the decrease in CL 
appeared to be slightly delayed and less pronounced than for the IPd treatment in Study EFC14335 
(Figure 6). The difference in PK parameters between IKd and IPd populations translated into differences 
in isatuximab exposure as shown above.

Forest plot of CTW4 vs covariates in EFC15246 and EFC14335 is presented in Figure 7 and shows that 
most important covariates were the same in both studies. Taking into account sample sizes and intrinsic  
effect of all covariates; Ig MM Type was considered as the most influential one with a 1.34 fold higher 
predicted CTW4 in Non IgG patients vs IgG ones. β2 microglobulin, albumin and then derived ISS showed 
also some pronounced effects in CTW4, as in POH0503. It should be also noted that low body weighted 
patients (<50 kg) showed higher CTW4 in EFC15246 (Ikema) than normal weighted patients whereas 
exposure in same patients was lower in EFC14335 (Icaria) than in the reference group.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of carfilzomib on the pharmacokinetics of isatuximab 
The PK of isatuximab were assessed in EFC15246 using the new bioanalytical method with the Gyrolab 
platform (DOH1586). Since this assay method was also used for the isatuximab single-agent arm of the 
combination study TCD14906, the isatuximab PK data from study EFC15246 were compared with those 
from study TCD14906 in order to characterise how carfilzomib may affect isatuximab PK.

Table 4. Descriptive statistics for isatuximab AUC1week at cycle 1 day 1 for isatuximab alone (TCD14906) 
or in combination with carfilzomib/dexamethasone (EFC15246).   
In addition, these results are confirmed by an investigator-sponsored study (Martin T, et al.) in which 
isatuximab was given in combination with carfilzomib/dexamethasone. After the first administration 
following 10 mg/kg QW/Q2W isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib/dexamethasone, isatuximab 
exposure (AUC1week, 15 100 μg•h/mL; CV, 26%) was comparable to that observed with isatuximab 
administered as a single agent (mean AUC1week range: 14 400-17 000 μg•h/mL), suggesting no effect 
of carfilzomib at a dose of 20-27 mg/m2 on the PK of isatuximab. 
Effect of isatuximab on the pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib 
The effect of isatuximab on carfilzomib and cemiplimab has been evaluated based on the comparison of 
PK data from 2 combination studies (EFC15246 and TCD14906, respectively) and data published in 
literature.  
In study EFC15246 within the IKd arm, blood samples were collected from 30 patients at Cycle 1 Day 15 
to evaluate the PK of carfilzomib administered at 56 mg/m² in combination with isatuximab 10 mg/kg. 
The exposure of carfilzomib in Cycle 1 day 15 was calculated using non-compartmental analysis. After the 
administration of carfilzomib at 56 mg/m2 in combination with isatuximab at 10 mg/kg, the carfilzomib 
PK parameters are in range with those of carfilzomib single-agent therapy published in literature, 
indicating no effect of isatuximab on carfilzomib PK.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
The mechanism of action is described in the initial submission.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments were described in the initial submission.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed in the pivotal study, EFC15246, and in single agent 
studies TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2, TED14154 Part B, and TED14095, and in combination studies 
TCD14906 and TCD14079 Part B. Data are reported for serum M-protein (all studies) and FCGR3A 
genotypes (all studies except for study TCD14906, in which this analysis was not part of the study 
objectives). 
M-protein is an immunoglobulin (entire or light chain) secreted in excess by an abnormal clonal 
proliferation of plasma cells in patients with MM. M-protein level is a key component in the assessment of 
clinical response. 
To engage effector functions, isatuximab binds to NK cells through Fc gamma receptors (FCGR). Several 
polymorphisms identified in these genes result in either high or low affinity receptor expression, 
impacting the effector functions.  
An association analysis of F158V bi-allelic polymorphism of FCGR3A with efficacy parameters in study 
EFC15246 is presented in this submission. These data are discussed in the efficacy section under ancillary 
analysis. The F158V single nucleotide polymorphism of FCGR3A was analysed in studies EFC15246, 
TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2, TED14154 Part B, TED14095, and TCD14079 Part B. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was evaluated throughout the clinical development program. This section provides an 
update to the integrated summary of immunogenicity that was included in the original IPd submission. 
In the pivotal IKd Phase 3 study EFC15246, ADA samples were collected in all patients in the isatuximab 
arm at baseline, on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle up to Cycle 10 (or the last cycle if a patient 
discontinued study treatment before Cycle 10), or up the PFS cut-off date, whichever came first, unless 
previously positive. If patients were ADA positive or inconclusive at Cycle 10 (or the last cycle of 
treatment) or at the PFS cut-off date, one additional sample for ADA evaluation was collected 3 months 
later; no further ADA was sampled, even if this 3-month sample was positive. 
ADA response for the supplemental studies was assessed at baseline, during treatment, and then at 30 
days and 60 or 90 days after the last isatuximab treatment. Studies TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2, 
TED14095, and TCD14079 were amended to assess ADA response in a similar manner to what was 
implemented in EFC15246 (ie, baseline, during treatment up to Cycle 10 or the last cycle if a patient 
discontinued study treatment before Cycle 10). 
In the results, there was no confirmed positive ADA response in the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC15246 for 
the IKd combination; hence, no neutralising ADA assessment was done. Among the 9 completed studies, 
a total of 21 patients exhibited a positive response in the ADA assay in at least one patient sample (Table 
6).

2.3.1.  PK/PD modelling 
The relationships between PK and efficacy and between PK and safety were assessed using data from the 
pivotal IKd study, EFC15246, for justification of the proposed dose for the target indication. Exposure-
Response (E-R) analyses were performed with population PK model-predicted exposure parameters of 
isatuximab as prognostic factors for efficacy outcomes (rate of very good partial response or better 
[VGPR+], rate of minimum residual disease negativity [MRD-], and progression-free survival [PFS]). With 
regard to the E-R safety analyses, the endpoints of interest were infusion reactions (IRs), 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infections, respiratory events, cardiac events, and cardiac failure. 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses for efficacy (report POH0804) 
Similar to the previous exposure-response (E-R) analyses for efficacy with either single agent or 
combination therapy (presented in the original submission), isatuximab trough concentration at the end 
of 4 weeks (CT4W) was determined to be the best PK exposure predictor of response (VGPR+, MRD-, and 
PFS) in the Phase 3 study EFC15246 with the isatuximab dose regimen of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the 
first cycle and every 2 weeks thereafter (QW/Q2W) in combination with Kd. 
Overall, when the E-R curves are divided at the median CT4W, both IKd subpopulations (CT4W below and 
above median) showed a treatment benefit versus Kd (higher VGPR+ rate, higher MRD- rate, PFS HR<1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 21/105 
 
 
 
 
 
Among the different PK exposure parameters tested, CT4W was found to be the best predictor 
(p<0.0001) of VGPR+ after adjusting for baseline LDH level. The probability of a VGPR+ response was 
found to increase with a linear increase of CT4W (linear form of logit function CT4W link). Besides CT4W, 
the final logistic regression model included plasmacytoma (yes/no), the Revised-ISS (R-ISS) group (R-
ISS Stage I or II versus III), and the baseline serum albumin level (<35 or ≥35 g/L).  
Based on the final model, the overall model-predicted VGPR+ rate was 82.66% when the CT4W was 
above or equal to the median, and was 65.45% when the CT4W was below median. Moreover, when 
focusing on the lowest part of the E-R curve, the model-predicted VGPR+ response rate was 56.20% for 
the 1st exposure quartile (Q1) comparable to the response rate for the Kd arm (56.83%).  
Figure 8 illustrates the E-R relationship model expected probability of VGPR+ by R-ISS Stage and albumin 
level group (<35 or ≥35 g/L) according to each quartile of CT4W in the absence of plasmacytoma, 
acknowledging that the vast majority of the patients in the study had no plasmacytoma (≥85%). 
Figure 8. Model-predicted probability of VGPR for patients without plasmacytoma by R-ISS stage and 
albumin groups (10mg/kg QW/Q2W, POH0804).  
Among the 43 patients in the lowest quartile of the E-R curve (Q1), 86.0% were IgG MM patients (a lower 
proportion of patients were IgG MM type in the upper quartiles). It has been shown that the typical IgG 
MM patient has a higher linear CL at steady state which translates into a 44% lower CT4W compared to 
the CT4W in the typical non-IgG MM patient (POH0503); however, IgG MM type was not the only reason 
for the lower exposure in the first quartile. A total of 24 patients (55.8%) in Q1 received 4 isatuximab 
administrations, while 19 patients (44.2%) received <4 isatuximab administrations; of those 19 patients, 
16 encountered isatuximab dose delay and/or dose omissions due to the occurrence of certain AEs during 
the first four weeks of the treatment period.

For MRD negativity, analyzed as a subgroup of IKd VGPR+ patients, the PK/PD relationship was described 
by a sigmoid Emax model. In addition to CT4W, for a given CT4W value the probability to respond to 
isatuximab treatment as MRD- was greater for those without prior PI therapy compared to those who had 
previously received a PI. From the final model, 90% of maximal effect (EC90) was reached in the upper 
part of the second quartile (Q2) for CT4W. When CT4W was above or equal to the median, the model-
predicted MRD- rate was 37.59%, and was 25.21% when CT4W was below the median. Moreover, when 
focusing on the lowest part of the E-R curve, the model predicted a lower MRD- response rate (16.77% in 
Q1), but still above the predicted MRD negativity rate for Kd arm (10.65%). 
For PFS, from the Kaplan-Meier plots, PFS appeared to improve with increasing isatuximab exposure 
(Figure 9). Patients in the highest quartiles seemed to have a better PFS than patients in the lower 
quartiles. However, this analysis does not account for the potential effect of confounding variables; 
therefore, model-based analyses were conducted. The PK/PD relationship was described by a Weibull 
parametric hazard model. The E-R analysis revealed that PFS increased as CT4W increased. In addition to 
CT4W, PFS increases with decreases in the β2 microglobulin level and with decreases in the percent of 
plasma cells in bone marrow; PFS decreases in patients with both prior PI and IMiD treatment. The 
estimation of the PFS HR versus Kd at the median CT4W of subgroups (median or quartiles) showed that 
patients with ≤median CT4W benefit from isatuximab treatment (HR 0.52), even those in the lowest 
quartile of exposure (HR 0.63) (Figure 10). However, similar to the outcome of E-R analyses for the 
other efficacy endpoints, this observation in Q1 is heavily confounded by the poorer myeloma prognostic 
factors and high incidence of carfilzomib and isatuximab dose modifications in this quartile. Finally, since 
the patient characteristics of the IKd subgroups populations were unbalanced with the Kd population, a 
matched analysis was done for the IKd subgroup defined by low or high exposure (≤ median or >median) 
of the PK predictor with their corresponding matched subgroups of the Kd population. From this matched 
analysis, patients with isatuximab in the two lowest and two highest exposure quartiles (ie, ≤ or > median 
CT4W, respectively) showed treatment benefit in terms of PFS compared to the matched Kd, which 
resulted in a HR of 0.522 and 0.475, respectively.

Exposure-response (E-R) analyses for safety 
While Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported more frequently in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (76.8% versus 
67.2%), the addition of isatuximab to Kd did not add substantial safety concerns. In the IKd arm, there 
was a higher incidence of respiratory infections all grades (83.1% versus 73.8%) and of Grade ≥3 
neutropenia by laboratory analysis (19.2% versus 7.4%; driven by a difference in Grade 3 neutropenia: 
17.5% versus 6.6%) compared to the Kd arm. Isatuximab IRs occurred in 45.8% of patients; 1 patient 
experienced a Grade 3 IR, but otherwise the IRs were Grade 1-2, and all had an onset at the first infusion 
(ie, mainly during the first 2 days of treatment). 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This application concerns a new indication of treatment for the MM patients with isatuximab in the 
combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (IKd), but the dose regimen of isatuximab was the 
same as in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (IPd), i.e. 10 mg/kg administered 
intravenously (IV) once weekly (QW) for the first cycle (28 days; 4 once-weekly administrations), and 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) thereafter (QW/Q2W). ADME of isatuximab was mainly referred to the original 
dossier. The exposure of isatuximab in the combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone has been 
studied in the target patient population in Study EFC15246 (Phase III) and compared to the exposure of 
isatuximab in study EFC14335 (IPd).  
Bioanalytical methods 
A new bioanalytical (Gyros) method has been used to analyse isatuximab in study EFC15236. The method 
was validated in line with the bioanalytical method validation guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009), 
however the intra-assay precision exceeded the acceptance margin of within 20% of the nominal value at 
each concentration level (25% at the LLOQ and ULOQ), however, on average over the 6 runs, the intra-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 24/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assay variability was acceptable. In the cross-validation, a systematically higher Gyros concentrations 
than ELISA concentrations (mean relative difference of +25.4%) were observed. This is likely due to 
much lower dilution and higher calibration curve (5.00 - 500 μg/mL) with the Gyros method than ELISA 
(0.5 – 20 ng/ml). The systematically higher Gyros concentrations may in part explain the observed higher 
exposure of isotuximab in study EFC15246 than in previous studies e.g. study EFC14335. 
The bioanalytical methods for antibody isatuximab antibodies have been validated in the original dossier, 
the provided adendum was also in line with the guideline and also the bioanalytical method for carfilzomib 
was adequately validated. The methods are considered robust. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib was evaluated for one dose interval at cycle 1 day 15 using non-
compartmental analyses while pharmacokinetics of isatuximab were evaluated by popPK analysis since 
mainly Ctrough and few post-dose samples were collected for isatuximab in study EFC15246. Therefore, 
the existing popPK model POH0503, used in the assessment for the original dossier, was updated with the 
sparse sampling data from study EFC15246. Based on the model validation presented here, the 
population PK model analysis (POH0630) from POH0503, used in posterior Bayesian estimation 
methodology, was considered suitable to describe individual PK profiles of EFC15246 patients.  
Drug interaction between isatuximab and carfilzomib was evaluated by cross-study comparison with 
monotherapy studies. Since no interaction is expected between an antibody and a small molecule other 
than interleukine levels mediated effect of some antibodies, such across study comparion is considered 
acceptable. Indeed, cross-study comparison indicated that there is no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
interaction between isatuximab and carfilzomib. Isatuximab exposure when administered in combination 
with carfilzomib/dexamethasone (EFC15246) was comparable to that after single agent therapy 
(TCD14906), with the geometric mean ratio (EFC15246/TCD14906) for AUC1week being 0.81. Of note, 
this comparison used isatuximab PK data generated for each study by the same bioanalytical method 
(using the Gyrolab platform). 
In general, study EFC15246 showed a higher exposure of isatuximab than reported previously reported 
for study EFC14335. As indicated above there was no pharmacokinetic interaction between isatuximab 
and carfilzomib. The 30-40% higher exposure after the first dose observed in IKd study EFC15246 
compared to the IPd study EFC14335 is considered to be mainly due to the difference in the assay 
methods, where the cross-validation found a 25% difference in the sample concentrations. Differences in 
baseline characteristics of the patients may have contributed to a lesser extent. Following multiple 
dosing, isatuximab exposure was 2-fold higher in IKd study EFC15246 compared to the IPd study 
EFC14335. With additional responder analyses, it was shown that subjects with a response had a lower 
clearance of isatuximab both in IKd study EFC15246 compared to the IPd study EFC14335. Since the 
response rate was higher in the IKd population compared to the IPd population, exposure was higher in 
the IKd population and the difference is amplified over time. It has been shown for several antibodies that 
patients with a good response/longer OS have a lower clearance of the antibody (Bajaj et al. 2017, Wang 
et al. 2017, Turner et al. 2018), hence differences in response rate between the IKd population compared 
to the IPd population is likely to result in some difference in pharmacokinetics of isatuximab.  
The PK data of isatuximab in study EFC15246 have been adequately presented in the SmPC of Sarclisa. 
Exposure-response analyses 
In line with the original dossier, isatuximab Ctrough at 4 weeks (CT4W) was used for studying the 
exposure and efficacy/safety relationship.

The model predicted a higher probability of VGPR+ response in R-ISS Stage I or II patients when 
compared to R-ISS Stage III for the same isatuximab exposure. In addition, within the same R-ISS group 
(the R-ISS Stage I or II group or the R-ISS Stage III group), the model predicted a higher probability of 
VGPR+ response in patients with a serum albumin level ≥35 g/L compared to those with a low albumin 
level (<35 g/L). Also, the predicted probability of being a responder without plasmacytoma was higher 
than with plasmacytoma for a given CT4W value. This is not unexpected, as this is an additional response 
criterion in IMWG to meet versus non-plasmacytoma; additionally, extramedullary plasmacytoma is more 
resistant to treatment.  
The model also suggested that the probability of responding to treatment would have been higher if 
patients completed the 4 weekly administrations; 149 of 172 patients in the IKd arm received 4 
administrations at Cycle 1, with most of the patients being in the three highest quartiles of exposure 
(55.8%, 90.7%, 100%, and 100% of patients received 4 weekly administrations in CT4W exposure 
quartiles Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively). Indeed, the predicted probability of being a responder was 
56.4% for the Kd arm, 66.0% in Q1 in the IKd arm, 68.0% in Q1 assuming all patients completed the 4 
weekly administrations of IKd (Q1 Sim), and 69.4% for patients in Q1 who completed the 4 weekly 
administrations in the IKd arm (Q1:4 adm). 
Of note, the interactions between R-ISS and serum albumin, R-ISS and CT4W, and serum albumin and 
CT4W were not statistically significant. Also, the interaction between IgG MM types and CT4W was not 
significant; this indicates that VGPR+ will be similar between the IgG and non-IgG populations for the 
same CT4W value. 
There appeared to be a positive exposure – efficacy (PFS) relationship, but it was only seen between Q1 
and other quartiles. Overall, when divided by median CT4W, both IKd subpopulations (CT4W below and 
above median) had a treatment benefit versus Kd (higher VGPR+ rate, higher MRD- rate, PFS HR<1). 
The treatment effect on VGPR+, MRD-, and PFS appeared to be less in the lower part of the E-R curve 
(Q1 versus the other quartiles of CT4W); However, this finding in Q1 was confounded by differences in 
patient characteristics and dose modifications for isatuximab and carfilzomib. Forty-four percent (44%) of 
the patients in Q1 were identified as patients with missed doses of isatuximab in the first 4 weeks, 
leading to lower exposure. These patients had more aggressive myeloma characteristics, which make 
patients less responsive to treatment, and also puts them at greater risk of adverse events (AEs), 
particularly respiratory infections, leading to isatuximab and carfilzomib dose reduction/delay.  
Of note, half of the patients (8/16) with dose delay or omissions had these modifications due to 
occurrence of a respiratory infection at Cycle 1. Consistently, among these patients, most (14/16) also 
had carfilzomib dose reductions/omissions at Cycle 1. This higher incidence of isatuximab and carfilzomib 
dose modifications, those mainly due to respiratory events, is likely linked to the more aggressive 
myeloma characteristics in patients in this quartile (as mentioned above): there was a higher proportion 
of patients in Q1 had a lower baseline albumin, higher baseline β2 microglobulin, more bone marrow 
plasma cells, and higher lactate dehydrogenase compared to other quartiles. In Q1, there were also more 
patients with plasmacytoma and at R-ISS Stage III, and a larger portion of these patients received more 
prior chemotherapy lines (>1), which consisted mainly of prior proteasome inhibitor (PI) and 
immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) therapies (which by themselves decrease the likelihood of tumor 
response), compared to the other quartiles. All of these parameters are associated with higher disease 
burden or poor prognosis characteristics in multiple myeloma. This suggests that the lower part of the 
slope in the E-R curve was confounded by the patients’ baseline disease characteristics and by high 
incidence in dose modifications both for isatuximab and carfilzomib. 
This phenomenon of lower monoclonal antibody exposure in subjects with risk factors for survival 
compared to subjects with better disease severity/health status has been observed for other monoclonal 
antibodies in treatment of cancer (Azzopradi et al. 2011, Han et al. 2014, Cosson et al. 2014, Feng et al. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 26/105 
 
 
 
 
2013,Bajaj et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017, Turner et al. 2018). Also here, the low exposure-PFS 
relationship was shown to be heavily confounded by the poorer myeloma prognostic factors and high 
incidence of carfilzomib and isatuximab dose modifications in this quartile. When accounting for β2 
microglobulin level, in the percent of plasma cells in bone marrow, and pre-treatment regimen, the 
estimation of the PFS HR versus Kd at the median CT4W of subgroups (median or quartiles) showed that 
patients in the lowest quartile of exposure HR was 0.63.. These analyses, along with the observed clinical 
data, provide a justification for the 10 mg/kg QW/Q2W of isatuximab in combination therapy with Kd. 
The exploratory E-R analyses conducted using quartile of exposure metrics did not show an apparent 
relationship between an increase of isatuximab exposure and an increase in the incidence of the safety 
endpoints of interest (including IRs, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infections, respiratory events, 
cardiac disorders, and cardiac failure), based on the PK/PD population for the different subgroups and on 
Ig MM type (IgG versus non-IgG MM patients). 
The lack of exposure-safety relationship, was also the case in the original application for IPd treatment in 
study EFC14335.    
Immunogenicity 
Anti-isatuximab antibodies have not been identified in the patient’s samples in study EFC15246, which 
indicates a very low immunogenicity of isatuximab (in line with the results in the original dossier). 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the exposure of isatuximab has been studied in the target patient population and the data 
supports the proposed dose regimen in the patients.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Data to support the current application comes from one pivotal phase III study EFC15246 evaluating 
isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in 302 patients with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Furthermore, the addition of dexamethasone to isatuximab or 
carfilzomib to isatuximab was studied in a company sponsored study TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2 and 
investigator-sponsored study TCD12795, respectively (see Table 7).

Treatments 
Study treatment is defined as isatuximab/carfilzomib/dexamethasone in IKd experimental arm and 
carfilzomib/dexamethasone in Kd control arm. 
Patients randomised to the IKd arm received the following treatments: 
• 
Isatuximab 10 mg/kg was administered IV on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at Cycle 1, and then on Days 
1 and 15 for subsequent cycles. The first infusion was initiated at 175 mg/hour and in the absence of IRs 
after 1 hour of infusion, the infusion rate was increased in 50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hour. Subsequent infusions were initiated at 175 mg/hour and in the absence of IR 
after 1 hour of infusion, the rate was increased by 100 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hour.  
Carfilzomib (after appropriate hydration) was administered IV over 30 minutes at a dose of 20 
• 
mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 and 56 mg/m2 on Days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 
16 of subsequent cycles if the patient did not experience any Grade >2 toxicity except in case of non-
complicated hematological toxicity related to treatment or resolved tumor lysis syndrome [TLS]). 
• 
Dexamethasone 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 in a 28-day cycle, between 15 to 
30 minutes (but no longer than 60 minutes) prior to isatuximab or at least 30 minutes prior to carfilzomib 
on the days when there was no isatuximab administration. 
Dexamethasone was administered intravenously (IV) on the days of isatuximab and/or carfilzomib 
administration and orally (PO) on the other days. 
Patients randomised to the Kd arm received the following treatments: 
• 
• 
Carfilzomib was administered as described for the IKd arm 
Dexamethasone 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23, at least 30 mins prior to 
carfilzomib on the days of carfilzomib administration. Dexamethasone was administered IV on the days of 
carfilzomib administration and PO on the other days. 
Both isatuximab and carfilzomib can induce infusion associated reactions (IARs) and premedication was 
required prior to their administration. Premedications and guidelines and medications administered for 
patients who developed IRs were provided in the protocol. 
The recommended premedication agents are listed below in the order in which they were to be given. 
• 
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 650 mg to 1000 mg PO 15 to 30 minutes (but no longer than 60 
minutes prior to isatuximab infusion). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 30/105 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Ranitidine 50 mg IV (or equivalent). 
Diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg IV (or equivalent). 
Dexamethasone 20 mg IV (which is also part of study treatment, and was to be administered 
prior to isatuximab or carfilzomib administration). 
Oral hydration (30 mL/kg/day) for carfilzomib started at least 48 hours before Cycle 1 Day 1, and was 
continued for infusions within Cycle 1 and in Cycle 2 and beyond at the Investigator’s discretion. 
A cycle duration is 28 days. Patients could continue study treatment until disease progression, 
unacceptable AEs, patient wish to discontinue further study treatment, or any other reasons. There is no 
limitation in the number of cycles to be administered in the absence of major toxicity, disease progression 
or any other discontinuation criteria. 
No dose reductions are allowed for isatuximab infusion, but dose interruptions, omissions, and delays 
were permitted for subsequent treatment cycles based on individual patient tolerance. For carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone also dose reductions were allowed. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the benefit of isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone in the prolongation of PFS using IMWG criteria as compared to carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM previously treated with 1 to 3 lines of 
therapy. 
The key secondary efficacy objectives were: 
•  To evaluate ORR. 
•  To evaluate rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better. 
•  To evaluate rate of VGPR or better (IMWG criteria) with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negativity in both arms. 
•  To evaluate complete response (CR) rate in both arms (IMWG criteria). 
•  To evaluate OS in both arms. 
Other secondary objectives were: 
•  To evaluate safety in both arms. 
•  To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in both arms. 
•  To evaluate time to progression (TTP) in both arms. 
•  To evaluate the second progression-free survival (PFS2) in both arms. 
•  To evaluate time to first response in both arms. 
•  To evaluate time to best response in both arms. 
•  To determine the PK profile of isatuximab and carfilzomib when combined together. 
•  To evaluate immunogenicity of isatuximab in isatuximab arm. 
•  To evaluate generic and disease- and treatment-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), and 
changes in HRQL, health state utility, and health status in both arms.

Exploratory objectives were: 
•  To explore PK and pharmacodynamic (PDy) relationship. 
•  To explore the relationship between immune genetic determinants and efficacy endpoints. 
•  To explore relationship between cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) not part of Revised International 
Staging System (R-ISS) including, but not limited to, del (1p) and gain (1q) and efficacy 
endpoints. 
•  To explore the impact of M-protein measurement without isatuximab interference on best overall 
response assessment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documentation of progressive 
disease (PD) or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Progressive disease was to be 
determined by the IRC according to IMWG criteria using central laboratory results and central review of 
radiologic imaging and, if any, local bone marrow assessment. Response and progression based on serum 
and/or urine M protein were to be confirmed by 2 consecutive assessments. Progression based on 
plasmacytomas/bone lesions did not require confirmation. The date of the PD was defined as the earliest 
date that indicated PD (provided that progression was subsequently confirmed when required). 
If PD and death were not observed before the analysis cut-off date or the date of initiation of further anti-
myeloma treatment, PFS was censored at the date of the last valid disease assessment not showing PD 
(censoring for further anti-myeloma treatment) or the analysis cut-off date, whichever came first. A 
patient without an event (death or PD) and without any valid post-baseline disease assessments was 
censored at the day of randomisation (Day 1). 
The sensitivity analyses included: 
•  PFS analysis based on IRC ignoring further anti-myeloma treatment 
•  PFS analysis based on investigator’s disease assessment and including symptomatic deterioration 
•  PFS analysis based on investigator’s disease assessment and ignoring symptomatic deterioration 
•  PFS analysis based on IRC including initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment considered as 
event 
•  Analysis based on scheduled assessment dates instead of actual assessment dates and late PFS 
events censored (analysis done if lack of adherence to the protocol-defined schedule of disease 
assessments between the treatment arms was detected) 
•  Unstratified PFS analysis 
•  PFS analysis using stratification factors as per eCRF 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
• ORR: Defined as the proportion of patients with stringent complete response (sCR), CR, VGPR, and PR 
as best overall response (BOR), as assessed by the IRC using the IMWG criteria. Bone marrow biopsy 
could have been done for sCR assessment as per Investigator decision. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 32/105 
 
 
 
 
 
• Rate of VGPR or better: Defined as the proportion of patients with sCR, CR, and VGPR as BOR. 
• MRD negativity rate in patients with VGPR or better: Defined as the proportion of patients for whom 
MRD was negative at any timepoint after first dose of study treatment. MRD status was assessed centrally 
by NGS-based test in bone marrow samples from patients who achieved VGPR or better. The threshold 
for negativity was 10-5. 
• CR rate: Defined as the proportion of patients with sCR and CR as BOR. Patients with demonstrated 
isatuximab interference will be considered in the BOR category corresponding to the M protein 
assessment obtained without interference, when the antibody-capture interference assay will be 
available. 
• OS: Defined as the time from the date of randomisation to death from any cause. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
• DOR: Defined as the time from the date of the first IRC determined response (PR or better) to the date 
of first documented PD determined by IRC or death, whichever occurred first. DOR was censored at the 
date of the last valid disease assessment not showing PD performed prior to initiation of a new anti-
myeloma treatment (if any) or the analysis cut-off date, whichever occurred first. 
• TTP: Defined as time from randomisation to the date of first documentation of PD (as determined by the 
IRC). If progression was not observed before the analysis cut-off date or the date of initiation of further 
anti-myeloma treatment, TTP was censored at the date of the last valid disease assessment not showing 
disease progression prior to the initiation of any further anti-myeloma treatment (if any) or the analysis 
cut-off date, whichever came first. 
• PFS2: Defined as time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documentation of PD (as 
reported by the Investigator) after initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment or death from any cause, 
whichever happens first. For patients alive without progression after initiation of further anti-myeloma 
treatment before the analysis cut-off date, PFS2 was censored at the date of the last FU visit without 
disease progression after initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment or the analysis cut-off date, 
whichever came first. 
• Time to first response (TT1R): TT1R was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of first IRC 
determined response (PR or better) that was subsequently confirmed. In the absence of response, 
patients were censored at the earliest of the date of the last valid disease assessment before disease 
progression or death, the date of the last valid disease assessment before initiation of a further anti-
myeloma treatment (if any) or the analysis cut-off date, whichever came first. 
• Time to best response (TTBR): Defined as the time from randomisation to the date of first occurrence of 
IRC determined best overall response (PR or better) that was subsequently confirmed. In the absence of 
response, patients were censored at the earliest of the date of the last valid disease assessment before 
disease progression or death, the date of the last valid disease assessment before initiation of a further 
anti-myeloma treatment (if any) or the analysis cut-off date, whichever came first. 
• Renal response: A complete renal response (CR renal) was defined as an improvement in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from <50 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline to ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 in at least 
1 assessment during the on-treatment period. 
- A partial renal response (PR renal) was defined as an improvement in eGFR from <15 mL/min/1.73m2 
at baseline to at least 1 assessment in the range [30 to 60[mL/min/1.73m2 during the on-treatment-
period. 
- A minor renal response (MR renal)was defined as an improvement in eGFR from <15 mL/min/1.73m2 at 
baseline to at least 1 assessment in the range [15 to 30[mL/min/1.73m2 during the on-treatment-period 
Assessment report

or from [15 to 30 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline to at least 1 assessment in the range [30 to 
60[mL/min/1.73m2 during the on-treatment-period. 
- A durable CR renal was defined as a response that lasted ≥60 days. 
The following analyses were added after database lock: 
• Analyses for PFS and overall response in patients with isolated gain(1q21) abnormalities at baseline to 
determine whether the addition of isatuximab was beneficial in this group of patients. 
• Analyses of baseline characteristics and patient disposition in the following subgroup of patients: 
America geographical region, FCGR3A, and MRD negative and MRD positive patients. 
• Progression free survival analysis within the IKd arm depending on premature carfilzomib 
discontinuation (yes versus no). 
• Analysis of adjusted potential CR rate considering interference tested by mass spectrometry. 
• A sensitivity analysis has been added upon United States Food and Drug Administration request to 
evaluate the impact of late progressions and deaths. In this sensitivity analysis, progressions or deaths 
occurring more than 8 weeks after the last disease assessment (corresponding to two consecutive missed 
assessments) were censored at the earliest of the date of last valid disease assessment without evidence 
of progression before initiation of new anti-myeloma treatment and the cut-off date. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, PFS). It was assumed that Kd 
arm would have a median PFS of 19 months and the IKd arm would have a 41% risk reduction in HR 
compared with the Kd arm. A planned interim analysis for PFS was done when 65% of the PFS events had 
been observed. An O’Brien and Fleming α-spending function was used to obtain the nominal significance 
levels for the interim and final analyses of PFS. 
Based on the above assumptions, a total of 159 PFS events were needed to achieve a 90% power for the 
study. Three hundred patients (180 patients in the IKd arm and 120 patients in the Kd arm) were 
expected to be adequate to achieve the targeted number of events for PFS. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (IKd arm or Kd arm) in a 3:2 ratio using 
interactive response technology (IRT). Patient were stratified according to  
• 
number of prior lines (1 versus >1), and  
•  R-ISS (I or II versus III versus not classified [inconclusive FISH unless stage can be determined 
on LDH, albumin, and β2 microglobulin only]). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study but assessment of outcomes (response, progression) was based on the 
review of the data collected for disease evaluation (radiological assessment, bone marrow assessments 
and central laboratory disease assessments) by IRC blinded to study treatment arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021

Statistical methods 
The interim efficacy analysis was the comparison of PFS based on the IRC assessment in the IKd arm 
versus the Kd arm using a log-rank test procedure stratified by the stratification factors as entered in the 
IRT (ie, R-ISS and number of previous lines of therapy). 
An O’Brien and Fleming α-spending function was used to obtain the nominal significance levels for the 
interim and final analyses of survival on PFS. The 1-sided nominal significance level to declare 
overwhelming efficacy when 103 PFS events (65% information fraction) were observed was 0.005 
(corresponding to an HR of 0.6) and to declare superiority of IKd at the final analysis (159 events) was 
0.023 (corresponding to a HR of 0.725). The stopping boundaries on PFS endpoint at the interim analysis 
were calculated using the actual number of events. The interim analysis was performed by an 
independent statistician under the supervision of the DMC. The DMC also reviewed secondary efficacy 
endpoints and safety data available at the time of the interim analysis. 
Analysis populations  
•  Randomised population: The randomised population includes all patients who signed an ICF and 
were allocated a randomisation number by the IRT, regardless of whether the patient was 
treated. 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: The ITT population is the randomised population. This was the 
primary population for all efficacy analyses. 
All efficacy analyses using the stratification factors were performed based on the stratification factor as 
per the IRT. 
•  Safety population: The safety population includes patients in the ITT population who received at 
least 1 dose or a partial dose of the study treatments. This population was the primary population 
for the analysis of all safety parameters. All analyses using this population were based on the 
treatment actually received.  
•  PK population: The PK population was defined independently for isatuximab and carfilzomib and 
included all participants from the IKd safety population with at least one available concentration 
post-baseline (whatever the cycle and even if dosing is incomplete) with adequate documentation 
of dosing and sampling dates and times. 
• 
Immunogenicity population: The immunogenicity population included all participants from the IKd 
safety population with at least one ADA result (negative, positive or inconclusive) post-baseline.

Recruitment 
A total of 341 patients were screened and 302 were randomised into the study between 25 October 2017 
and 21 March 2019. Patients were randomised at 69 sites in 16 countries. The countries with the largest 
enrolment were France (39 patients), Australia (37 patients), Czech Republic (34 patients), Brazil (33 
patients), and Republic of Korea (27 patients). 
Three patients out of 302 randomised patients (2 in the IKd arm and 1 in the Kd arm) did not receive 
treatment. 
As of the interim analysis cutoff date (07 February 2020), 168 patients have discontinued study 
treatment (84 [46.9%] in the IKd arm and 84 [68.3%] in the Kd arm). Most subjects discontinued due to 
progressive disease (see Table 8).

Protocol Amendments 
There were 6 global amendments and 1 country-specific (UK) amendment. One global amendment and 
the country-specific amendment were implemented prior to patient enrollment.  
The timing, rationale, and key details of major changes to the protocol statistical section which were 
implemented after the first patient was randomised and before the cut-off date of the planned interim 
analysis are provided in Table 9. Importantly, the censoring rules for the primary endpoint PFS  were 
amended based on Health Authority feedback (amendment 7). The PFS definition was modified such that 
the date of initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment was considered when determining the cut-off 
date for PFS. PFS2 was also updated according to the change.

EMA/CHMP/186236/2021

Of note, in amendment 4 (global July 2018) it was clarified that in absence of radiological and M protein 
progression, if clinical and biological data together provided clear evidence of clinical progression based 
on IRC judgement, the IRC could consider clinical progression as a PFS event. 
Table 9 Protocol amendment statistical changes 
Protocol deviations 
Inclusion criteria violations of having received more than 3 previous treatment were reported in both 
arms: n=1 (0.6%) in the IKd arm and n=2 (1.6%) in the Kd arm. Three other inclusion criteria violations 
were reported only in the IKd arm: one patient was refractory to prior anti-CD38 treatment, one patient 
had received anti-myeloma treatment within 7 days of randomisation, and one patient did not have an 
LVEF measurement taken until after study treatment initiation. 
The most frequent critical or major deviations related to randomisation procedures were wrong stratum of 
randomisation (7.3% in the IKd arm and 16.3% in the Kd arm) with stratification error in R-ISS stage 
(4.5%, 10.6%) and number of prior lines (2.8%, 5.7%), and IMP given without IRT procedure at resupply 
visit (2.2%, 2.4%). According to the study report the stratification errors did not lead to an imbalance in 
incidence of patients with each stratification factor between IKd and Kd. 
Baseline data 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT analysis set. A summary of demographics and subject 
characteristics and disease characteristics at study entry in the ITT is shown in Table 10, Table 11, 12, 13 
and 14.

Overall 61 (20.2%) patients overall had renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline), 43 
(24.0%) patients in the IKd arm and 18 (14.6%) patients in the Kd arm. 
Cytogenetic risk, as determined by central laboratory based on FISH, was assigned to 87.2% of patients 
in the IKd arm, and in 88.6% of patients in the Kd arm. High-risk cytogenetic status was defined as the 
presence of del(17p) in at least 50% of analysed plasma cells and/or translocation t(4;14) and /or 
translocation t(14;16) in at least 30% of analysed plasma cells. Overall, 24.2% of patients had high risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities with a incidence in the IKd and Kd arms of 23.5% and 25.2%, respectively. 
Gain (1q21) was present (i,e. at least 3 copies in at least 30% of analyzed plasma cells) in 127 subjects , 
49 (16.2%) also had one of the other high risk cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) and 78 (25.8%) had 
isolated gain (1q21) (47 (26.3%) patients in the IKd arm and 31 (25.2%) patients in the Kd arm). 
The median number of prior lines was 2.0 (range 1 to 4) in both arms (see  
Table 14). The main anti-myeloma therapies which were most frequently used were corticosteroids 
(100% patients), proteasome inhibitors (overall 89.7%, Kd 86%; IKd 93%, mostly bortezomib),

alkylating agents (overall 89.4%; Kd 82%; IKd 94%, mostly cyclophosphamide and/or melphalan), and 
immunomodulators (overall 78.1%; Kd: 81% vs IKd 76%, mostly lenalidomide and/or thalidomide). A 
total of 32.8% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide (31.8% in IKd arm, and 34.1% in Kd), 30.1% 
were refractory to bortezomib (29.1% in IKd arm, and 31.7% in Kd) and 14.9% of patients were 
refractory to both (14.5% in IKd, and 15.4% in Kd).There were 61.3% of patients who had undergone 
prior ASCT (64.8% in IKd arm, 56.1% in Kd arm). 
Almost no subject had received prior Abs, only 1 subject (in the IKd) arm had received prior CD38 
directed therapy and 5 subjects (1 Kd arm and 4 in IKd) had received prior elotuzumab. 
Table 14 Prior anti-myeloma treatments  
Numbers analysed 
All randomised patients (179 in the IKd arm and 123 in the Kd arm) were included in the efficacy (ITT) 
population (see Table 156). Three randomised patients did not receive study drug and were excluded 
from the safety population. The safety population included 177 patients in the IKd arm and 122 patients 
in the Kd arm. All treated patients received the study treatment allocated by the IRT.

Table 15 Analysis populations 
At the cut-off date, 131 patients (93 [52.0%] in the IKd arm and 38 [30.9%] in the Kd arm) were still on 
treatment. The overall median duration of exposure was 72.9 weeks (range 1 to 114). The median 
number of cycles was 18.0 (range 1 to 28). Exposure (median duration of exposure and median number 
of Cycles) was higher in IKd arm (see Table 24 in safety section). 
The median relative dose intensity (defined as the ratio of the actual dose intensity to the planned dose 
intensity in percent) was: 
• Isatuximab: 94.27% in the IKd arm; 
• Carfilzomib: 91.31% (range 18.2 to 108.7) and was similar in both arms (91% Kd vs 91% IKd); 
• Dexamethasone: 87.1% (range 24.5 to 101.6) and was similar in both arms (88% Kd vs 85% IKd). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The PFS analysis cutoff date for this interim analysis was 07 February 2020, at which time a total of 103 
PFS events (per IRC) were reported as defined in the protocol. This was also the cutoff date for all other 
efficacy analyses. 
Primary endpoint 
At the cutoff date, 48 (26.8%) and 55 (44.7%) patients had an PFS event in the IKd and Kd arms, 
respectively, with a median follow-up of 20.73 months. The HR for the primary analysis was 0.531 (99% 
CI: 0.318 to 0.889), corresponding to a reduction of 46.9% in risk for disease progression or death with 
IKd compared to Kd. The median PFS was not reached in the Ikd arm and was 19.15 months (95% CI: 
15.770 and upper limit not reached) in the Kd arm (see Figure 12). The 1-sided stratified log rank test 
resulting from the comparison of PFS between the 2 arms was statistically significant with a p-value of 
0.0007, which met the prespecified efficacy boundary of 0.005. 
At the time of the cut-off date, a total of 131 (73.2%) and 68 (55.3%) patients in the IKd and Kd arms, 
respectively, had not had a PFS event and were censored with the main reason for censoring ongoing 
follow-up (83.2% and 72.1% of the censored subjects in the IKd and Kd arms respectively).

Several sensitivity analyses were performed resulting in HRs ranging from 0.510 to 0.595 (see Table 16, 
median PFS was not reached in the IKd arm and ranged from 16.1 to 20.3 months in the Kd arm. They all 
showed statistically significance differences favoring of IKd over Kd (range p-values 0.0003 to 0.0024).

Subgroup analyses for prespecified patient subgroups were conducted when at least 10 patients were 
included in each treatment arm within a subgroup (see Figure 13). 
In the America geographical region (PFS subgroup analysis), the HR was 1.244 (95% CI 0.431 to 3.590). 
Further analyses have been performed to understand these results (see section on Ancillary analyses 
below).

Key secondary endpoints 
Overall response rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 46/105 
 
 
 
 
 
The ORR (≥PR based on IRC assessment) in the IKd and Kd arms was 86.6% and 82.9%, respectively. 
The difference between the 2 arms was not statistically significant (p-value was 0.1930). As a 
concequence subsequent endpoints were not to be tested for statistical significance.  
The ORR based on the Investigator assessment was 85.5% and 83.7% in the IKd and Kd arms, 
respectively.  
The median time to first response was 1.08 months (95% CI: 1.051 to 1.117) and 1.12 months (95% CI: 
1.051 to 1.183) in the IKd and Kd arms, respectively. The median time to best response was: 4.60 
months in the IKd arm (95% CI: 3.811 to 5.257) and 3.78 months in the Kd arm (95% CI: 2.858 to 
4.172). 
Rate of VGPR or better 
VGPR or better response was achieved in 72.6% versus 56.1% in the IKd and Kd arms, respectively 
(nominal p=0.0011).  
MRD negativity rate in patients with VGPR or better 
The incidence of patients with at least one evaluable MRD sample among with patients with VGPR or 
better as per Ivestigator was similar in the IKd and Kd arms (78% versus 74%). MRD negativity rate (10-
5 sensitivity level by central lab NGS) in the ITT population in patients with VGPR or better was 29.6% 
[95% CI: 0.2303 to0.3688] in the IKd arm and 13.0% [95% CI: 0.0762 to 0.2026] in the Kd arm (see 
Table 18). 
Table 17 - MRD negativity rate 
CR rate  
CR rate was 39.7% vs 27.6% in the IKd and Kd arm, respectively. 
Isatuximab may co-migrate with M-protein on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation 
electrophoresis assays that are used for monitoring the MM disease and determining response to 
treatment. This interference can mislead the interpretation of the response assessment based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. To evaluate whether isatuximab had interfered 
with M-protein quantification, 27 patients in the IKd arm, who either had immunofixation-positive near-
Assessment report

CR in whom criteria for CR were met except for residual immunofixation positivity (historic near-CR 
category) as their best response as per investigator, or had SPEP ≤0.5 g/dL with IgG kappa or kappa 
subtypes (potential CR), were identified. Serum samples from these patients were tested by mass 
spectrometry after separation of isatuximab signal from the myeloma M-protein signal. In 17 out of the 
27 tested patients, there was no residual myeloma M-protein detectable at the sensitivity level of the 
immunofixation test (0.025 g/dL), at least at one time point. Among these 17 patients, 2 patients had 
best response CR as per IRC and 15 were VGPR as per IRC (including 11 identified near CR and 4 VGPR). 
Among these 15 patients, a local BMA showing less than 5% plasma cells infiltration is available for 11 
patients, meaning that 11 additional patients could have CR as best response leading to an adjusted 
potential CR rate of 45.8% (71 + 11 patients) in the IKd arm. 
In addition, among these 11 additional patients, 7 reached MRD negativity, leading to an adjusted 
potential MRD negativity CR rate of 24.0% (36 + 7 patients) in the IKd arm. 
This suggests that the CR rate in the IKd arm was likely underestimated due to the interference of 
isatuximab with M protein measurements and in particular the immunofixation test.

OS 
Overall survival was not planned to be tested at the time of the interim analysis as it was not mature and 
is planned per protocol to be analyzed 3 years after primary PFS positive analysis. At the cutoff date, with 
a median follow-up of 20.73 months, 31 (17.3%) and 25 (20.3 %) patients had a death event in the IKd 
and Kd arms, respectively. 
Other secondary endpoints:

Among 155 and 102 patients in the IKd and Kd arms, respectively, who were responders based on IRC 
assessment (PR or better), the median duration of response was not reached in either arm (at the 
analysis cut-off date) the HR was 0.425 (95% CI 0.269 to 0.672 favoring IKd over Kd). 
Time to progression 
The median TTP based on IRC assessment was not reached in the IKd arm and was 20.27 months (95% 
CI: 16.986 and upper limit not estimable) in the Kd arm. A low HR was observed for TTP (0.495 [95% CI 
0.324 to 0.757]) which was consistent with the primary PFS analysis. 
Time to next treatment 
Overall, time to next treatment in the IKd arm was delayed compared with the Kd arm (stratified HR 
0.566, 95% CI: 0.380 to 0.841. The median time to next treatment was not reached in either treatment 
arm. Among patients who received further anti-myeloma treatment (26.3% and 43.1% of patients in the 
IKd and Kd arms, respectively), the most frequent subsequent therapy given was an IMiD (83.0% and 
79.2% in the IKd and Kd arms, respectively) and corticosteroids (80.9% and 83.0%, in the IKd and Kd 
treatment arms respectively). Monoclonal antibodies were given less frequently in the IKd arm than the 
Kd arm (23.4% versus 54.7%) and was most often daratumumab (21.3% and 47.2%, respectively). 
PFS2 
At the cutoff date, 26.3% of patients in the IKd arm and 43.1% of patients in the Kd arm initiated a 
further anti-myeloma therapy. Median PFS2 had not been reached at the cutoff date in either treatment 
arm, the percentage of patients with PFS2 events was lower in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (21.8% 
versus 28.5%) a positive treatment effect (stratified HR 0.77, 95% CI: (0.486 to 1.228)) on PFS2 was 
observed in favor of the IKd arm. 
Among patients who had a PFS2 events, the most frequent event in the IKd and Kd arms were disease 
progression (48.7% and 65.7%, respectively) and death without any further anti-myeloma therapy 
before the cut-off (33.3% and 28.6%, respectively). A total of 140 (78.2%) and 88 (71.5%) patients in 
the IKd and Kd arms, respectively, did not have a PFS2 event and were censored. 
Renal response 
Renal function impairment (defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) was present at baseline in 43 of 163 
(26.4%) patients in the IKd arm and 18 of 111 (16.2%) patients in the Kd arm in the ITT population with 
an evaluable eGFR value at baseline. In patients with renal impairment the ORR was 93% vs. 61%, with 
VGPR or better rates of 79.1% vs. 44%, CR rates of 41.9% vs. 22% and MRD negativity (30.2% vs. 
11.1%) in the IKd arm vs the Kd arm respectively. 
Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory and post-hoc subgroup analyses 
Patient-reported outcomes: 
Analyses of PROs were performed on the ITT population with patient-reported outcome assessments 
evaluable for C30, MY20, and EQ 5D-5L. Statistical significance for within or between arm differences was 
not assessed, only descriptive summaries were provided. Clinically important changes from baseline were 
defined as increases or decreases of 10 points for C30 and MY20 summary scores, subscales and 
symptom items, 0.074 points for EQ-5D-5L health state utility values (HSUV) and 7 points for EQ-5D-5L 
VAS.

Health related quality of life was largely maintained during the treatment period in the IKd and Kd arms 
as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life (GHS QoL) score. Increases in 
C30 GHS/QoL scores of greater than 10 points were observed toward the end of the treatment period for 
those on Kd arm at Cycle 19 to Cycle 24. 
Isolated changes in MY20 summary scores of at least 10 points have been recorded, mostly observed 
towards the end of the treatment period, for both treatment arms, no clear or consistent patterns were 
observed on the MY20 body image, future perspective, disease symptoms, and side effects of treatment 
scales/items.  
No clear or consistent patterns were observed on the on the EQ 5D 5L HSUV and EQ 5D-5L VAS. 
Effect on ECOG status: Changes in ECOG performance status during study treatment (best score and 
worst score) were generally similar in the IKd and Kd arms. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities: An additional analysis was performed to characterise the PFS treatment effect 
within the individual cytogenetic abnormalities. Improvements in PFS were seen in patients with t(4,14) 
and gain (1q21) chromosomal abnormalities (HRs 0.549 and 0.569, respectively), and for del(17p) 
chromosomal abnormality the HR was higher (HR 0.837). 
Among the patients with isolated gain (1q21), the PFS HR was 0.462 (95% CI: 0.219 to 0.972). 
FCGR3A polymorphism was analyzed in blood samples from 285 patients, among which 114 patients 
received Kd therapy and 171 patients received IKd therapy. 
For the goup with genotypes 158F/F, PFS was in favor of the IKd group over the Kd group with a HR of 
0.722; (median PFS IKd not reached). The ORR in the Ikd and Kd arm was 86.6% in 58 patients vs 
91.2% in 31 patients, the VGPR+ rate was 71.6% (N=48) versus 67.6% (N=23) and the MRD negativity 
rate was 32.8% (N=22) versus 23.5% (N=8). 
For the group with  genotype 158F/V PFS was in favor of the IKd group over the Kd group with a HR of 
0.353 (median PFS IKD 18.20 months, 95% CI: 15.244 and upper bound not reached). The ORR in the 
Ikd and Kd arm was 91.0% in 71 patients vs 79.4% in 54 patients, VGPR+ rate was 79.5% (N=62) 
versus 51.5% (N=35), and the MRD negativity rate was 30.8% (N=24) versus 10.3% (N=7). 
For the group with  genotype 158V/V, PFS was similar between the IKd and Kd arm (HR 0.968; median 
PFS not reached). The ORRs in the Ikd and Kd arm 84.6% in 22 patients versus 91.7% in 11 patients, 
VGPR+ rate was 65.4% (N=17) versus 58.3% (N=7), and the MRD negativity rate was 26.9% (N=7) 
versus 8.3% (N=1). 
Baseline characteristics in the FCGR3A 158V/V subgroup were not all well balanced between the IKd and 
Kd treatment arms, with more patients with worse prognostic factors in the IKd arm (eg, more patients 
with high risk cytogenetics, R-ISS Stage III, 3 prior lines of therapy, and ECOG Performance Status 2 or 
3). These considerations may explain the similarity in PFS between treatment groups observed at the 
time of the interim analysis in the FCGR3A 158V/V subgroup. 
In was concluded that within the IKd arm no consistent trends associated with improvements in the 
different efficacy endpoints and FCGR3A polymorphism were observed. The interpretation is impacted by 
the low number of patients in some genotypic subgroups, and the imbalance in baseline disease 
characteristics between treatment arms within a genotype. 
Geographical area: In the population from the America geographical region (14.6% of the ITT, 24 
subjects in IKd and 20 subjects in Kd arm), the HR of the PFS subgroup analysis was 1.244 (95% CI 
0.431 to 3.590). Further analyses have been performed to understand these results. It was noted that 
study treatment discontinuation at subjects request was high (30%) and inconsistent with ITT population.

geographic region (amongst other things IKd arm enrolled more subjects with R-ISS stage III, with at 
least one cytogenetic abnormality, with 3 or more prior lines, with bone marrow involvement ≥50% and 
with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m²). These differences suggest patients in the IKd arm had worse prognosis 
than patients in the Kd arm and may explain the difference in PFS HR observed at the time of the interim 
analysis in the America subgroup. 
Prior therapies: Post-hoc analyses were performed in patients with and without prior lenalidomide 
exposure and in patients refractory or not to lenalidomide and in patients with and without prior 
bortezomib exposure and in patients refractory or not to bortezomib. In these sugroups all analysis 
favored IKd over Kd, with HR ranged between 0.383 and 0.692 for subgroups with at least 10 patients in 
each treatment arm.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Table 20 summarises key demographics, disease disease characteristics, and efficacy outcomes observed 
with the IKd regimen in study EFC15246 and with treatments consisting of the different components of 
the IKd regimen (Kd, Isa+K, Isa+d, Isa mono) as presented by MAH to support the efficacy of isatuximab 
(see supportive studies below). Although the MAH notes that cross-trial comparison is to be interpreted 
with caution, these data were interpreted to indicate that the IKd regimen has the best efficacy outcomes 
of the different regimens, and that each of the components (isatuximab, carfilzomib, and 
dexamethasone) is an active anti-myeloma agent contributing to the antitumor activity of the IKd 
regimen.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of isatuximab administered as a fixed 
infusion volume in combination with Pd as assessed by occurrence of grade ≥3 infusion associated 
reactions (IAR). The secondary objectives were to evaluate the infusion duration, the safety profile of the 
combination with isatuximab administration with fixed volume, the immunogenicity of isatuximab in 
combination with Pd and the efficacy of the combination of isatuximab with Pd (measured as ORR (CR + 
VGPR + PR) and clinical benefit rate (CR + VGPR + PR + MR) and the duration of response in RRMM 
patients.  
Isatuximab was dosed at 10 mg/kg (QW/Q2W), pomalidomide dose was 4 mg (daily D1-D21) and 
dexamethasone was dosed at 40 mg. Isatuximab was administered using a fixed infusion volume of 250 
mL. The starting infusion rates for the first second, and subsequent infusions are in line with that 
described in the SmPC, as well as the possibilities to increase infusion rates for the first and second 
infusion. For enrollment, the MM subjects had to have received at least two previous therapies including 
lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on last therapy or 
after completion of the last therapy. 
From 30 March 2018 to 27 December 2018, 47 patients were enrolled in Part B of the TCD14079 study 
from 11 sites based in the US. At the time of the final cut-off (October 2019), 22 patients (46.8%) were 
still on treatment. The reasons for study treatment discontinuation at the time of the analysis were: 
disease progression (15 patients, 31.9%), adverse events (AEs; 5 patients, 10.6%), and other reasons (5 
patients, 10.6%). One patient (2.1%) prematurely discontinued pomalidomide treatment due to an 
adverse event, and no patient prematurely discontinued dexamethasone treatment. 
The median age was 65 years (range 45 to 85 years), with the largest proportion of patients being aged 
<65 years (23 patients, 48.9%). All the patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, except 2 patients (4.3%) who 
had an ECOG PS of 2. The median number of prior treatment lines was 3 (min-max: 1-8) with 1 patient 
(2.1%) having received 1 prior line of treatment and 17 patients (36.2%) having received 2 prior lines of 
treatment. All patients had received an IMiD, a PI and corticosteroid in prior lines of treatment. The 
majority (39 patients, 83.0%) of patients received an alkylating agent. Seven (14.9%) and 9 (19.1%) 
patients, respectively, had received daratumumab (anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) and elotuzumab 
(anti-SLAM7 monoclonal antibody), prior to study entry. At study entry, 23 (48.9%), 12 (25.5%), and 7 
(14.9%) patients had ISS Stage I, II, and III, respectively. most patients (33 patients, 70.2%) had 
measurable serum M-protein. There were 10 patients (21.3%) with high risk cytogenetic characteristics 
and 17 patients (36.2%) entered the study with moderate renal impairment, 1 patient had severe renal 
impairment. 
Responses and disease progression were assessed by investigator. The ORR, determined in the all treated 
population (n=47), was 53.2% (95% CI: 38.1% to 67.9%), including 2 patients (4.3%) with CR (see 
Table 21). The median DoR (for patients who achieved a response of PR or better), median PFS and 
median OS could not be calculated because a high rate of censoring (21 of 25 pt with ≥ PR were censored 
for DoR, 27 of 47 patients (57.4%) patients were censored for PFS, 35 (74.5%) patients were censored 
for OS. The PFS probability was 0.741 at 4 months, 0.650 at 6 months, 0.604 at 8 months and 0.557 at 
12 months. The OS probability was 0.893 at 4 months, 0.845 at 6 months, 0.764 at 8 months and 0.706 
for 12 and 16 months. According to the MAH these efficacy results are consistent with the prior 
observations of this combination in Part A and in the ICARIA study (EFC15246). 
Among the 7 patients who had previous exposure to daratumumab treatment, there was 1 response of 
PR which lasted 0.85 months. One patient with prior exposure to daratumumab (014079B-840-017-204) 
was non-evaluable for response due to sudden death 7 days after the first study.

Table 21 Study TCD14079 part B: Best overall response, overall response rate and clinical benefit rate - 
All-treated  
Study TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2 
The efficacy data from TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2 are provided as they confirm the relevance of addition 
of dexamethasone to isatuximab. 
This study was an open-label, randomised, multicentre study designed to evaluate the activity and safety 
of isatuximab with or without dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or RRMM. The primary objective 
was to evaluate the activity in terms of overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab at the selected 
dose/schedule (20 mg QW/Q2W), as single agent (ISA arm) and in combination with dexamethasone 
(ISAdex arm) in patients with RRMM. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, efficacy (measured 
as DOR, Clinical benefit rate (CBR), PFS, and OS), the PK profile and immunogenicity of isatuximab in 
each arm. 
A total of 165 patients were enrolled in the study, and randomised (110 ISA arm; 55 ISAdex arm), 1 
patient was randomised and not treated. As of data cutoff date (21 January 2019), 96 (88.1%) patients 
in the ISA arm and 40 (72.7%) of patients in the ISAdex arm had definitively discontinued study 
treatment. The main reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression (64.2% ISA arm; 
60.0% ISAdex arm), and adverse events (11.9% ISA arm; 9.1% ISAdex arm). Three (5.5%) patients in 
the ISAdex arm prematurely discontinued dexamethasone due to an AE. 12 patients in the ISA arm and 2 
patients in the ISAdex arm discontinued because of a reason classified as “other”( unconfirmed disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision). 
The median age was 68.0 years (range 37 to 84 years) and 66.0 years (range 42 to 85 years) in the ISA 
and ISAdex arms, respectively. The vast majority of patients had an ECOG PS of 0, or 1. Few patients 
(6.4% and 10.9%) had ECOG status 2 (Isa and Isadex). The median number of therapy lines was 4.0 
(range 2 to 10 lines) in both the ISA arm and in the ISAdex arm. Forty-three (39.4%) patients in the ISA 
arm and 21 (38.1%) patients in the ISAdex arm received ≥5 prior lines of therapy. All patients except 1 in 
the ISA arm received a PI and an ImiD agent, 4 (3.7%) patients in the ISA arm and 3 (5.5%) patients in 
the ISAdex arm received elotuzumab. 90.8% of patients in ISA arm and 89.1% of patients in ISAdex arm 
were refractory to their last regimen of anticancer treatment (IMiD, PI, IMiD and PI, IMiD or PI, and 
alkylating agent). A total of 72.0% patients were double refractory to IMiD and PI.

A total of 26 (23.9%) patients in the ISA arm and 24 (43.6%) patients in the ISAdex arm achieved a 
response (see Table 22). The difference between the ISA arm and the ISAdex arm was considered 
significant, with a p-value of 0.0083 obtained by a 1-sided Fisher test. In responding patients the median 
DOR was 8 months (1-21 months min/max) in the ISA arm, and 12.2 months (2-19 months min/max) in 
the ISAdex arm. The clinical benefit rate (response MR or better) was 43.1% in the ISA arm and 54.5% 
in the ISAdex arm.  
Median PFS was 4.86 months in the ISA arm, and 10.15 months in the ISAdex arm. The unstratified 
hazard ratio was 0.677 versus the ISA arm (95% CI 0.44-1.043), with a p-value of 0.0743. Median OS 
was 18.92 months for patients in the ISA arm and 17.25 months for patients in the ISAdex arm The 
unstratified hazard ratio was 0.799 (95% CI 0.484-0.1321), with a p-value versus ISA arm of 0.3808. 
Table 22 Study TED108984-P2S2: Best overall response, overall response rate and clinical benefit rate 
based on IAC 
Study TCD12795 
This was an investigator initiated study (Martin et al,manuscript in preparation), the study database is not 
available to the MAH. However a summary of the efficacy data of this IST have been briefly summarised 
in support of the relevance of addition of carfilzomib to isatuximab.  
In this US study, 33 patients received IKd with 3 isatuximab dose regimens, including 24 patients at the 
10 mg/kg QW/Q2W dose used in the pivotal EFC15246 study. All patients received carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 
IV Cycle 1 Day 1 ,2, then 27 mg/m2 IV on Days 8, 9, 15, 16, and then for all subsequent doses. After 
Cycle 8, patients were allowed to decrease carfilzomib frequency to D1, 2, 15, 16 per cycle while 
maintaining biweekly isatuximab, per investigator and patient choice. Dexamethasone was not considered 
part of the treatment regimen, but was given to prevent infusion reactions. At the time of data cut-off, 4 
patients remained on-treatment and 28 patients had discontinued study treatment due to disease 
progression.

The median age was 61 years (range 38 to 78). The majority were male (73%) and 30% were age>65 
years. There were 6 patients (18%) with high risk cytogenetic characteristics. The median number of 
prior treatment lines was 3 (range 2 to 8). All patients were previously exposed to IMIDs and to 
proteasome inhibitors. 
Overall, the median number of cycles for study treatment was 10 (range 2 to 34). The median duration of 
follow-up was 26.7 months (range 13.3 to 61). The ORR for the entire study population (N=33) was 70% 
(95% CI: 51% to 84%) with 4 patients achieving sCR/CR (12%), 8 patients VGPR (24%), and 11 patients 
PR (33%). The median DOR was 10 months (≥PR; range 1.9-29.4), and over one-third of responders 
achieving a remission duration of >18 months. Responses were consistently observed in all subgroups 
investigated. The median PFS was 10.1 months (95% CI: 6.4 to 16.4). The median OS has not been 
reached, and the 2-year OS was 76% (95% CI:, 63 to 92%). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Data to support the current application for the use of isatuximab  in combination with carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
therapy, come from one pivotal phase III study (EFC15246) and 3 additional studies to support the 
combination with dexamethasone or carfilzomib. The design of the pivotal study, comparator arm, 
isatuximab dose, randomisation, and endpoints were discussed and agreed in scientific advice. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study is a randomised, open-label, multicentre study comparing the combination of 
isatuximab with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (IKd) versus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Three hundred patients were to be 
randomly assigned to a treatment group (IKd arm or Kd arm) in a 3:2 ratio stratified according to 
number of prior lines (1 versus >1), and R-ISS (I or II versus III versus not classified). 
The target population consisted of MM patients with measurable disease with at least 1 but no more than 
3 prior lines of therapy. Patients who had primary refractory disease, were refractory to prior anti-CD38 
mAb, with measureable disease only by free light chain (FLC), or had prior carfilzomib treatment were 
excluded from the study. The target population is relatively fit given the requirement for ECOG PS ≤ 2 and 
criteria on organ dysfunction.  
Patients were to receive isatuximab (10 mg/kg QW for 1st cycle of 28 days, followed by Q2W in 
subsequent cycles) in combination with carfilzomib (20/56 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) (IKd 
regimen), or carfilzomib and dexamethasone alone in the control arm of the study (Kd regimen). The 
choice for an add-on study, with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) as backbone was agreed in 
scientific advice. It was agreed that the objective of this study was not comparing the IKd regimen with 
other triplet regiments but to show the added benefit of adding isatuximab to this (highly active) doublet 
therapy. At the time of the scientific advice the Kd regimen was recently approved for RRMM subjects 
with 1 prior line of therapy, and it is still one of the treatment options for MM in 2nd line and beyond. 
The rationale for the dose and absence of dose-response studies for the combination was agreed upon in 
scientific advice. The exposure-response analysis is supportive for the 10 mg/kg dose (see discussion on 
Clinical Pharmacology). 
As is often seen in the treatment of MM, patients could continue study treatment until disease 
progression, unacceptable AEs or patient decision to stop study treatment.

The primary endpoint is PFS. ORR, rate of VGPR or better (VGPR+), VGPR+ with MRD negativity, and OS 
were key secondary endpoints. As is needed for an open label study, PFS and response rate were 
determined by an IRC blinded to the randomisation and using central laboratory results and central 
review of radiologic imaging, and, if any, local bone marrow assessment. PFS and response were to be 
determined according to IMWG criteria, however progression on bone marrow was not a criterion for 
disease progression as patients without any measurable serum M-protein and/or urine M-protein were not 
eligible for study EFC15246. This is in line with the algorithm on this topic in the IMWG criteria2. Efficacy 
analysis was on the ITT set (which is also the randomised population). 
The choice for PFS as the main outcome variable in this setting is generally accepted as there are 
different efficacious subsequent treatment options that patients could receive in subsequent therapies, 
which will likely modify the expected survival and because of a rather expected long PFS (expected to be 
>18 months in the control arm). As noted in scientific advice, the results on OS and PFS2 must be 
indicative of no detrimental effect.  
Regarding the definition of PFS and the choice for handling of intercurrent events, it was noted that the 
start of subsequent therapy and clinical deterioration were considered the most important events that 
influence the interpretation of PFS. Clinical deterioration was mostly ignored for assessing PFS (treatment 
policy strategy) and subsequent therapy was mostly censored (hypothetical strategy). This led to multiple 
‘sensitivity’ analyses for PFS which relate in fact to a number of estimands in the sense of 
EMA/CHMP/ICH/436221/2017. Of the various estimands 3 are of particular interest: PFS as if subsequent 
therapy would not have occurred (this is the primary analysis); PFS based on the first PFS event 
regardless whether subsequent therapy was started (treatment policy; the analysis recommended in the 
Appendix 1 to the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man - methodological 
consideration for using progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS) in confirmatory 
trials  CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1); and PFS counting subsequent therapy as an event (composite strategy, 
as investigators can see a progression coming upfront in this disease and therefore start a new therapy) 
is considered the main efficacy analysis and the results of this PFS definition are reflected in the SmPC 
(see section 5.1). 
The choice of censoring in the definition of TT1R / TTBR is not supported. Patients were to be censored on 
the last measurement before PFS event (death, progression) or new therapy. In principle this could lead 
to overestimation of the TT1R and TTBR. However, the impact of this is expected to be limited given the 
high response rate and the low number of subjects with an early death. Furthermore, while TT1R and 
TTBR provide insight into the time needed for treatment to have its (maximal) effect, these parameters 
are of less importance for the interpretation of the benefit of treatment. 
In contrast to previous advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/376795/2017) and guidance on PFS as a primary 
endpoint (CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1), an interim analysis for PFS was planned. Only 31% of patients 
have an event (50% in the final analysis) and this immaturity may hamper conclusions given the 
heterogeneous prognoses of patients, especially for the patients with better prognosis.  
The number of randomisation strata: 2 x 3 = 6 in 300 patients is rather large could be acceptable 
provided that no empty strata are present. In the stratum with R-ISS unclassified < 10 patients were 
enrolled in each arm. However the low number of subjects is accepted as this stratum was assumed to be 
included to better compare the effect in strata with R-ISS stage I or II with R-ISS stage III. 
The primary endpoint PFS was to be tested hierarchically for the interim and final analysis. An O’Brien 
and Fleming α-spending function was used to obtain the nominal significance levels for the interim and 
final analyses of survival on PFS, CR and MRD negativity rate. ORR and VGPR+ had a Pocock α-spending 
function. OS is only tested once, approximately 3 years after the primary PFS analysis. The combination

of group-sequential testing for PFS and hierarchically testing the other endpoints group-sequentially after 
that protects the type I.  
During the study the definition of PFS was modified such that the date of initiation of further anti-
myeloma treatment was censored, i.e. the primay estimand was changed. This was based on external 
feedback from the FDA, however in the context of an open-label trial, it cannot be excluded that this may 
also have been guided by on internal information. As the original planned analysis (without censoring) is 
in line with the amended analysis, it seems unlikely that internal availability of results informed the MAH 
in this open-label trial. MRD negativity in patients with VGPR+ was added into the hierarchical testing 
strategy before CR. As this does not concern the primary endpoint, this is agreed. 
The number of protocol deviations relating to in- and exclusion criteria were low (n=5) and are 
considered unlikely to have significantly impacted the study results. There were a number of protocol 
deviations related to randomisation (wrong stratum); these were 20 in IKd arm and 13 in Kd arm). These 
were mostly related to the R-ISS stratum and most likely caused by the complexity of the R-ISS scale, 
which was only validated in 2015 (i.e. shortly before the study was initiated), and by the urgent need to 
start treatment. When the sponsor identified the stratification factor error rate, a corrective action was 
put in place (provision of a R-ISS calculation tool) which decreased the rate of errors. Importantly, the 
stratification errors did not lead to an imbalance in incidence of patients with R-ISS stratification factor 
between IKd and Kd arms or PFS analysis as was shown by sensitivity analyses. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The ITT consists of 302 subjects, with 179 randomised to IKd arm and 123 into the Kd arm, 3 subjects 
did not receive treatment (2 in IKd and 1 in Kd). At the data cut off for this interim analysis, 168 patients 
have discontinued study treatment (84 [46.9%] in the IKd arm and 84 [68.3%] in the Kd arm and 
treatment was ongoing for the remainder of the subjects. 
The median age of the ITT population at time of enrolment was 64 years (range 33-90 years), 
approximately half of the population was > 65 years, only a a few (n=26) subjects older than 75 were 
enrolled. Slighty more more males were included than females (56 vs 44%), which is a reflection of the 
slightly different incidence of MM in males vs females. The vast majority of the subjects were white 
(70%) and approximately half of the population came from Europe. While patients with ECOG stage 2 
were allowed to enter the study, only few (n=16) subjects with ECOG 2 were randomised (11 in IKd arm 
and 5 in Kd arm). Information on the number of subjects with ECOG status 0 or with status 1 could not 
be found. Most patients (70%) had IgG type of MM, only few had R-ISS stage III (8%) at study entry, 
while 26% of the subjects had R-ISS stage I and 60% had R-ISS stage II. R-ISS stage could not be 
classified for 7% of the subjects. Overall, 24.2% of patients had high risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Most 
patients had bone lesions (71% per eCRF) and/or soft tissue plasmacytoma (94% per eCRF). Overall 61 
(20.2%) patients had renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline).  
The median number of prior lines was 2.0 (range 1 to 4) in both arms, with 44% having received 1 prior 
line, 33% 2 prior lines and 21% 3 prior lines of therapy. Five subjects (2%) had received > 3 lines of 
therapy (N=3 in IKd and n=2 in Kd arm) which is a protocol deviation, although in the listing of protocol 
deviations only 3 subjects are noted. This discrepancy was due to two cases for whom the algorithm used 
to calculate the number of lines (Rajkumar & Kumar S, 2020) overestimated the number of prior lines, 
which was corrected upon review by a clinician. In total there were 3 subjects included with >3 prior lines 
instead of the protocol required 1-3 prior lines of therapy.   
The number of prior regiments were higher than the number of prior lines with median of 3 (range 1-11) 
because a line of therapy can consist of several regimens . All patients had relapsed disease and majority 
(72%) had relapsed and refractory disease. Most patients had received an PI (90%) and/or IMID (78%),

less than half were refractory to lenalidimide (33%), bortezomib (30%) or both agents (15%). There 
were 61.3% of patients who had undergone prior ASCT. Only one subject had received prior anti-CD38 
directed therapy. 
The patient characteristics were well balanced between study arms, except for some minor differences. 
The patients in the Kd arm were slightly younger and this arm contained slightly more subjects from non-
western countries. Also the disease characteristics were sufficiently balanced between the study arms. In 
the Kd arm there were slightly more subjects had ISS Stage I at study entry (58% vs 50%), but the 
distribution across the R-ISS stages seems balanced between the arms. Slightly more subjects with 
serum LDH elevated and with renal impairment (24% vs 14.6%) were included in the IKd arm. Also with 
regard to the prior-anti-myeloma treatments study arms were reasonably well balanced. A slight 
difference between the arms is noted in frequency of subjects with 2 prior lines (35.8% in the IKd arm 
and 29.3% in the Kd arm) and 3 prior lines (18.4% IKd and 24.4% Kd), and who had prior ASCT (64.8% 
in IKd arm, 56.1% in Kd). There were slightly more relapsed and refractory subjects in the Kd arm than 
the IKd arm (76% vs 68%).  
Overall while some slight imbalances are noted between the treatment arms in some of the parameters, 
the differences are not consistently favouring the IKd arm nor significantly large to impact the 
interpretation of the study. It is thus considered that the treatment arms are sufficiently balanced to 
allow a meaningful comparison.  
The enrolled patient population seems an adequate reflection of the target population. The selection of 
patients based on prior treatment regiments or response to prior treatment regimens was limited to the 
exclusion of subjects with primary refractory disease, of subjects who were refractory to prior anti-CD38 
mAb and of those with prior carfilzomib treatment. These selection criteria do not need to be reflected in 
the indication, although the target population should be described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In line with 
the in/exclusion criteria, the study population included refractory and non-refractory subjects and had a 
mix of prior treatment therapies, except for prior CD38 directed therapies. Only one subject was enrolled 
who already had received prior anti-CD38-directed therapy. Although it is recognised that the 
pharmacological profile of isatuximab and other CD38-directed therapies (daratumumab) differs to some 
extent, it cannot be excluded that prior exposure would have had an effect on the activity of isatuximab. 
Therefore the lack of data on the impact of prior CD38 directed therapy on efficacy of IKd regimen is 
mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. While the patients needed to have RRMM for study entry, the 
proposed indication does not specify that patients should have relapsed and/or have refractory MM. This 
omission can be accepted as this is in line with the indication of other products for the same target 
population (e.g. daratumumab, carfizomib). 
Overall the studied population is considered an adaquete reflection of the target population which is 
appropriately described in the proposed wording of the indication.  
The primary endpoint of the study was already met at the interim analysis. Superiority of IKd over Kd 
was shown in the ITT with a HR of 0.531 (99% CI: 0.318 to 0.889), and a p value (1-sided stratified log 
rank test) of 0.0007. The curves seem to start separating only after approximately 8-9 months, which 
may indicate non-proportional hazards, however, this will have a conservative effect on the hazard ratio 
and the log-rank test. It does however suggest that the effect of adding I to a Kd backbone is small for 
those with a (very) worse prognosis.  
The median PFS was not reached in the Ikd arm and was 19.15 months (95% CI: 15.770 - not reached) 
in the Kd arm, which is consistent with the protocol assumption of 19 months. The observed effect size is 
clinically relevant, and is largely independent of the choice for censoring and event rules or stratification 
rules (so largely independent of what is considered an PFS event) as all ‘sensitivity’ analyses using 
resulted in relatively similar HR (0.51-0.595), a median PFS in control arm of 16-20 months and median 
PFS not reached in IKd arm. This indicates that different estimands of PFS have similar results, and in 
Assessment report

that sense the primary endpoint may be considered to be robust. Of note, overall maturity of data is 
limited (34% of patients in primary analysis and 39% in the analysis recommend by the guideline on PFS 
as primary endpoint CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1), and there is a high degree of censoring after 18 month, 
so the effect of treatment for those with better prognosis is not established. The study is still ongoing and 
the final PFS analysis at 159 PFS events will be performed as per protocol this currently estimated to 
occur in approximately 3Q2021. At this time an update of the duration of response (DoR) and the time 
from randomisation to the date of second disease progression or death from any cause, whichever 
happens first (PFS2), will be also provided. With this analysis, overall survival (OS) Kaplan-Meier curves 
will be provided for information without statistical test, as the protocol pre-specifies that the OS will be 
tested 3 years after positive PFS analysis (with positive interim PFS analysis in 2020 this OS analysis is 
planned in 2023). The MAH has committed following the CHMP recommendation to provide final PFS and 
OS analyses once the analysis have been performed at the protocol specified moment. 
In the subgroup analysis a positive effect of adding I to Kd backbone was also seen in most (prespecified) 
subgroups, with some variability. Although the PFS subgroup analyses was performed according to the 
PFS definitation of the primary analysis and not according to the EU recommended definition, the 
performed analysis is accepted given the limited difference in events (15 events) between these two 
definitions. The subgroup analysis revelad no impact of the number of prior therapies, previous treatment 
with SCT, PI or IMID on treatment outcome, thus supporting the broad indication. Deviations in HR from 
the primary analysis are noted in subgroups based on geographical region (with a HR of 1.244 in the 
population enrolled in the America-region), R-ISS stage (I or II vs III, with HR in population with R-ISS 
stage III close to 1), and presence/absence of cytogenetic abnormalities. A HR >1 noted in the subgroup 
enrolled in the America-region is most likely due to an imbalance in a substantial number prognostic 
facotes in favour of the Kd arm. A numerical difference in the HR point estimate is also noted in the 
subpopulations based on ECOG status (0 or 1 vs >1), and those on previous therapy with PI and IMID, 
however this may be explained by the low patient numbers in the subgroups with ECOG status >1 and 
those having received PI and IMID.  Upon request the MAH has submitted a subgroup analysis  based on 
response to prior therapy(CR or sCR and others). The HR in the subgroup of patients with CR or sCR 
during at least one prior therapy and the subgroup of other patients was 0.507 (95% CI: 0.265 to 0.968) 
and 0.501 (95% CI: 0.307 to 0.818), respectively. Overall, subgroup analyses for individual prognostic 
factors did not identify a population which may not benefit from adding I to a Kd regimen, as all HRs were 
(well) below 1. Thus the subgroup analyses cannot not explain the appearingly late separation of the PFS 
curves. As only 15% of the PFS-events occur before 9 months the this issue is not longer pursued. 
Furthermore, while these analyses indicate there may be subgroup who benefit less from the IKd vs Kd 
than the overall population, in particular those with R-ISS stage III, a detrimental effect of adding I to Kd 
was not seen in any of the subpopulations analysed.  
In the IKd arm a relative large group (15%) discontinued carfilzomib but remained on Id. The MAH 
provided an exploratory analysis of patiens comparing PFS of patients in the IKd arm who discontinued 
carfilzomib with those remaining on treatment and with the control arm. The HR in IKd without and with 
carfilzomib premature discontinuation versus Kd arm were 0.563 (99% CI: 0.332 to 0.957) and 0.268 
(99% CI: 0.07 to 1.029), respectively. Although this analysis should be interpreted with great caution 
because of confounding and limitations in sample size, the data indicate that discontinuation of 
carfilzomib from the IKd regime does not seem to compromise the efficacy of starting with treatment with 
IKd. 
The treatment effect in secondary endpoints TTP and TTNT was consistent with the effect seen in PFS. 
Only a limited effect in ORR was noted (86.6% vs 82.9%), but this may be expected with this very active 
backbone treatment. However, responses in the IKd arm were deeper (VGPR or better 72.6% versus 
56.1%, with MRD negativity rate of 29.6% vs 13.0%), and lasted longer (HR 0.425, median DoR not 
reached in both arms). A higher CR rate was also noted (39.7% vs 27.6%). Of note the CR rate may 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 62/105 
 
 
 
 
have been underestimated in the IKd arm because of the interference of isatuximab with M protein 
measurement (comigration of isatuximab with M protein could lead to a conclusion of presence of residual 
M protein which may infact be isatuximab). Correction for this interference (only applicable to I treated 
subjects) would lead to a CR rate and CR+MRD negativity in the IKd arm of 46% and 24% respectively.    
Protocol stipulated MRD results were missing for 49 patients with VGPR+ as per investigator (n=198).For 
23 of these 49 cases this was due to lack of BMA sampling, for the others BM sample was not evaluable 
for MRD e.g. due to lack of knowledge on dominant clone. As in general practice BM sampling is usually 
done at the time of CR (and not VGPR) and given the invasiness of the sampling procedure, it is 
acknowledged that there may have been some reluctance to BM sampling at VGPR by investigators. Of 
note this level of missing data (23 of 198 (12%) with investigator VGPR+) seems similar or lower to what 
has been reported in literature. 
A trend toward longer PFS2 in the IKd arm is noted, and no detriment on OS. While this is reassuring, it 
is noted that data are still very immature so updated data are to be provided when the analyses have 
been performed at the protocol specified moment (see RMP?). 
Among patients with renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2), a higher percentage experienced a 
complete renal response (≥ 1 assessment ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2) in the Ikd arm than in the Kd arm (52 vs 
31%). However, as patient numbers are limited (n=25 in IKd and n=13 in Kd), no clear conclusions on 
the benefit of adding isatuximab to Kd to improve renal response can be drawn. 
Several PROs were performed including the disease-specific EORTC QLQ-Myeloma module (MY20). 
However, interpretation of PROs in an open label study should be interpreted with caution. Compliance for 
all PROs was good. Only grouped averages were provided which had high standard deviation on each 
datapoint thus further hampering interpretation. Nevertheless it is noted that the median and mean (and 
SD) are very similar between the treatment groups and remain constant in time, except towards the end 
of the period (> 22 cycles) when only few patients are at risk. So it seems that there are no differences in 
health related quality of life between the study arms, and that thus adding I to Kd does not seem to 
negatively affect quality of life. 
The analysis of  FCGR3A polymorphism on treatment effect is hampered because of limited patients 
numbers in some genotypic subgroups, and the imbalance in prognostic baseline characteristics between 
the subpopulations. This particularly relates to the FCGR3A 158V/V subgroup in which the least benefit 
was noted of the addition of I to Kd, so no conclusion should be drawn based on this analysis.  
There were no dedicated studies in special populations.  
Regarding age, the median age of the studied population in the pivotal study was 64 years (range 33 to 
90) with appoximately half of the population (n=148) being ≥ 65 years. The subgroup analysis on the 
primary endpoint does not indicate a significant effect of age on efficacy. No separate analyses for 
efficacy was performed for subjects ≥ 75 years, which is accepted given the low number of subjects 
(n=26) in this age category. No children were included in this study. 
Regarding renal impairment, among patients with eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline, more patients in 
the IKd (13/25, 52%) arm experienced a complete renal response (≥ 1 assessment ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 
during Treatment) than in the Kd arm (4 of 13, 31%).   
There were few patients with abnormal hepatic function in the pivotal study (n=33), but these were not 
analysed separately for efficacy. This can be accepted as an impact of hepatic impairment on PK of 
isatuximab is not expected.  
Results from study TCD14079 Part B seem to support the fixed volume infusion. However as this has 
already been accepted previously (EMEA/H/C/004977/0000) and described in the SmPC, further 
discussion is not needed here.

Study TED10893 Phase 2 Stage 2 supports the addition of dexamethasone to isatuximab. 
Study TCD12795 was submitted to support the addition of carfilzomib to isatuximab. However, as this is a 
small study lacking a control arm, and considering the heterogeneity of the MM population and the 
difficulties with cross study comparisons it is difficult to draw firm conlusions.  
The complexity of cross study comparison is acknowledged.  
Overall, this analysis and the supportive studies are indicative of the activity of isatuximab when 
combined with dexamethasone of carfilzomib in the MM population and thus provide general support for 
the indication applied for but do not allow firm conclusions.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal study show a statistical significant and with a HR of 0.572 also a clinically 
relevant improvement of PFS when I is added to a Kd backbone. This result is considered robust and is 
supported by secondary endpoints indicating a deeper and longer response in patients treated with IKd 
versus Kd. Based on a limited number of events, no detriment seems apparent in OS and also PFS2 
suggests a beneficial effect of the IKd combination. These effects are seen across all subgroups tested.  
Given the immaturity of the data the treatment effect of IKd for those with good prognosis cannot 
accurately be determined due to the high level of censoring after 18 months. Therefore, the MAH will 
provide updated data, when available, to confirm the observed effect and the notion that also PFS2 is 
improved and there is no detriment on OS. 
Overall the studied population is considered an adequate reflection of the target population which is 
appropriately described in the proposed wording of the indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH presented the safety data from the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC15246 (IKEMA), a randomised, 
open-label, multicentre study of isatuximab combined with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (IKd) versus 
carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with RRMM, together with integrated supportive safety 
data for all isatuximab-treated patients from 9 company-sponsored MM studies (including EFC15246) that 
were completed or partially completed with at least one approved clinical study report (CSR) each by the 
cut-off date of 07 February 2020 for this application. 
Patient exposure 
Pivotal Phase 3 study EFC15246 (IKEMA) 
Study EFC15246 randomised a total of 302 patients (179 in IKd arm and 123 in Kd arm). Three of the 
randomised patients did not receive the study treatment and were excluded from the safety population. 
The safety population of the study consisted of 177 patients in the IKd arm and 122 patients in the Kd 
arm. 
As of the cut- off date of this analysis, the IKd arm had more patients still ongoing with study treatment 
than the Kd arm (52.0% versus 30.9%) and had fewer patients who definitively discontinued all study 
treatments (46.9% versus 68.3%). The main reasons for definitive treatment discontinuation (in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 64/105 
 
 
 
 
randomised population) were disease progression (29.1% in IKd arm versus 39.8% in Kd arm) and AEs 
(8.4% IKd versus 13.8% Kd) (Table 23).  
Table 23 Disposition of patients - EFC15246 - randomised population 
The definitive treatment discontinuations caused by reasons classified as “Other” were: 
• In IKd arm: unconfirmed progressive disease (PD) and/or PD per local laboratory results but not per 
central laboratory results (4 [2.3%] patients), “poor prognosis due to having reached the maximum 
expected response of the study treatment” (1 [0.6%]), and autologous stem cell transplant (1 [0.6%]). 
• In Kd arm: Investigator’s decision based on serum free light chain (FLC) increase (1 [0.8%] patient), 
Investigator’s decision to discontinue corticosteroid therapy due to achieved therapeutic effect and 
excessive adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy (1 [0.8%]), no evidence of clinical efficacy 
(1 [0.8%]), and autologous stem cell transplant (1 [0.8%]). 
Premature discontinuation of at least one study drug occurred in 19.2% of patients in IKd arm and 4.1% 
of patients in Kd arm, all due to AEs (Study EFC15246). Only 1 patient (0.6%) in this study had 
premature discontinuation of isatuximab. Carfilzomib was prematurely discontinued in 14.7% of patients 
in IKd arm and 0.8% in Kd arm. 
Treatment duration: 
In study EFC15246, the duration of treatment exposure was longer in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm 
(median: 80.0 weeks versus 61.4 weeks). The overall extent of treatment exposure was greater in the 
IKd arm compared to the Kd arm, with longer duration of treatment and more cycles started per patient 
(median: 19.0 versus 14.5) (Table 24). The percentage of patients with at least 18 cycles of treatment 
was 57.6% in IKd arm versus 39.3% in the Kd arm.

Table 24 Extent of overall exposure - EFC15246 - safety population
Isatuximab exposure: 
The median duration of isatuximab exposure was 79.86 weeks (median 19 cycles), with a median relative 
dose intensity (RDI) of 94.27% (range: 66.7 to 108.2%) (presented in Table 12 and Table 13 of SCS). Of 
the 177 patients who received isatuximab infusions, 62.1% had at least 1 dose omission and 38.4% had 
at least 1 infusion interrupted (due to TEAEs or other reasons). A total of 82 (1.4%) out of 5715 
isatuximab infusions were interrupted and almost all were re-started (except for 4 infusions not re-
started) (Table 25). 
Table 25 Summary of patients with at least one dose modification for isatuximab - EFC15246 - safety 
population (selection of Table 13 SCS) 
Carfilzomib exposure: 
Carfilzomib exposure was slightly greater in the IKd arm compared to the Kd arm in duration of exposure 
(median: 65.00 versus 59.57 weeks) and number of cycles started by patient (median: 16 versus 14). 
The median RDI for carfilzomib was similar between the two arms (91.18% versus 91.35%). The 
percentage of patients with at least 1 dose omission or dose reduction for carfilzomib was similar between 
the IKd and Kd arms (71.2% versus 72.1% for dose omission;35.0% versus 35.2% for dose reduction) 
(Table 26). The percentage of patients with at least 1 carfilzomib infusion interrupted was low and similar 
between the two arms (4.0% versus 3.3%).

Dexamethasone exposure: 
Dexamethasone exposure was also greater in the IKd arm compared to the Kd arm in duration of 
exposure (median: 76.14 versus 59.07 weeks) and number of cycles started by patient (median: 18 
versus 14). The median RDI for dexamethasone was 84.78% in IKd arm versus 88.37% in Kd arm. The 
percentage of patients with at least 1 dose omission or dose reduction was similar between the IKd and 
Kd arms (77.4% versus 75.4% for dose omission; 43.5% versus 38.5% for dose reduction).

Most frequent TEAEs by SOC and PT 
The most frequently reported TEAEs at SOC level (all grades, in ≥20% of patients in either arm) included: 
Infections and infestations (86.4% in IKd arm and 80.3% in Kd arm), General disorders and 
administration site condition (63.8%, 56.6%), Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (62.7%, 
26.2%), Gastrointestinal disorders (61.6%, 49.2%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(52.0%, 40.2%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (48.6%, 55.7%), Vascular disorders 
(46.3%, 44.3%), Nervous system disorders (39.0%, 43.4%), Psychiatric disorders (32.8%, 26.2%), Skin

and subcutaneous tissue disorders (27.7%, 13.1%), Cardiac disorders (23.7%, 22.1%), and Metabolism 
and nutrition disorders (23.2%, 17.2%) (Table 30). 
At PT level, the TEAEs with higher incidences (≥5% higher) in IKd arm than in Kd arm were: infusion 
related reaction (44.6% versus 3.3%), hypertension (36.7%, 31.1%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(36.2%, 23.8%), diarrhea (36.2%, 28.7%), fatigue (28.2%, 18.9%), dyspnea (27.7%, 21.3%), 
bronchitis (22.6%, 12.3%), cough (19.8%, 13.9%), and vomiting (15.3%, 9.0%). The TEAEs with lower 
incidences (≥5% lower) in IKd arm than in Kd arm were pyrexia (9.0% versus 14.8%) and 
thrombocytopenia (2.8% versus 9.8%). 
After adjustment for exposure, the type of TEAE and incidence in events per PY was similar and still 
higher in the IKd arm than in KD. For diarrhea (0.39, 0.35), dyspnea (0.28, 0.24), and cough (0.18, 
0.15), the exposure-adjusted incidences were similar between the IKd and Kd arms. 
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs (≥10% of patients in either arm) by primary SOC were 
Infections and infestations (38.4% in IKd arm and 28.7% in Kd arm), Vascular disorders (21.5%, 
23.8%), and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.7%, 4.9%). At PT level, the most frequent Grade ≥3 
TEAEs (in ≥5% of patients) were: hypertension (20.3% in IKd arm and 19.7% in Kd arm), pneumonia 
(16.4%, 12.3%), thrombocytopenia (2.3%, 8.2%), insomnia (5.1%, 2.5%), and dyspnea (5.1%, 0.8%) 
(Table 30).

Treatment-related TEAEs 
Overall, the IKd and Kd arms were balanced in the incidences of treatment-related TEAEs (86.4% versus 
80.3% for all grades; 49.2% versus 47.5% for Grade ≥3). The most frequent treatment-related TEAEs (all 
grades, ≥15%) were infusion related reaction (44.6% in IKd arm and 3.3% in Kd arm), hypertension 
(23.7%, 27.9%), fatigue (21.5%, 13.9%), insomnia (20.3%, 19.7%), and dyspnea (18.6%, 17.2%). The 
most frequent treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (all grades, ≥5%) were hypertension (13.0%, 18.9%), 
pneumonia (5.1%, 4.9%), and thrombocytopenia (2.3%, 6.6%). The IKd arm had higher incidence of 
treatment-related infusion related reactions (all grades), fatigue (all grades), but lower incidence of 
treatment-related hypertension (all grades and Grade ≥3) and thrombocytopenia (all grades). 
Post-treatment AEs: In study EFC15246, 5 (2.8%) patients in IKd arm and 4 (3.3%) patients in Kd arm 
reported post-treatment AEs (all grades); of them, 4 in IKd arm and 2 in Kd arm were both Grade ≥3 and 
serious. No single post-treatment AE (by PT) was experienced by more than 1 patient.

Serious adverse events 
The incidence of patients with serious TEAEs was similar between the IKd and Kd arms (59.3% versus 
57.4% for all grades; 53.1% versus 47.5% for Grade ≥3) (Table 31).

Deaths 
In study EFC15246, during both treatment and post-treatment periods, 30 [16.9%] patients in IKd arm 
and 25 [20.5%] patients in Kd arm had died; mostly due to disease progression (18 [10.2%] in IKd arm 
and 19 [15.6%] in Kd arm). The majority of deaths (45 of 55) occurred during the posttreatment period. 
During the treatment period, 10 patients died; the incidence was similar between the IKd and Kd arms (6 
[3.4%] and 4 [3.3%]). Adverse event was the cause of deaths for 5 (2.8%) patients in IKd arm and 2 
(1.6%) patients in Kd arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 71/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the posttreatment period, the main cause of death was disease progression, with lower incidence 
in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (9.6% versus 14.8%). Adverse event was the cause of death for 1 
patient (in IKd arm) during the posttreatment period. Nine patients (6 [3.4%] in IKd arm and 3 [2.5%] in 
Kd arm) died due to “Other” reasons (unrelated AEs or death from unknown cause). 
Of the 55 patients who died during the study, Grade 5 AEs (ie, AEs with fatal outcome during the study) 
regardless of causality of death were reported in 16 patients overall, with similar incidence between the 2 
arms (10 [5.6%] in IKd arm and 6 [4.9%] in Kd arm). Treatment-related Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in 
2 patients (both in IKd arm): atypical pneumonia in 1 patient (during treatment period) and 
pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in another (during posttreatment period). 
Two patients (1 in each group) experienced fatal AEs in the context of disease progression. Fatal AEs in 
context other than disease progression (regardless of causality of death) were reported in 6 (3.4%) 
patients in IKd arm and 3 (2.5%) patients in Kd arm.

Infusion reactions

Infusion reactions of any grades were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (in 81 [45.8%] of 
patients) than in the Kd arm (4 [3.3%]). In the IKd arm, IRs were mostly reported as induced by 
isatuximab. All IRs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 except for 1 patient (in IKd arm) who developed a Grade 3 
IR which was reported as carfilzomib induced. Of the 81 (45.8%) patients who experienced IRs, 76 
(42.9%) patients experienced IRs during the first 2 days of study treatment. Ten (5.6%) patients in IKd 
arm experienced IR episodes beyond Cycle 1. Five patients (2.8%) in IKd arm experienced 3 or more 
episodes of IRs. All IRs in EFC15246 were reversible and recovered without sequelae (with or without 
corrective treatment). Most IR episodes recovered within 1 or 2 days from onset (in IKd arm, 73.8% 
within 1 day, 23.8% within 2 days). Four IR episodes (3 [2.5%] in IKd arm and 1 [16.7%] in Kd arm) 
lasted for more than 2 days and recovered. 
Infusion reaction resulted in isatuximab discontinuation in 1 (0.6%) patient. Infusion reactions led to 
isatuximab dose interruption in 53 (29.9%) patients, isatuximab dose omission in 1 (0.6%) patient, 
carfilzomib dose interruption in 2 patients (1 in IKd arm and 1 in Kd arm), and carfilzomib dose reduction 
in 4 patients (3 [1.7%] in IKd arm and 1 [0.8%] in Kd arm). Although 29.9% of patients in IKd arm 
experienced at least one isatuximab dose interruption due to infusion reaction, the overall rate of 
isatuximab dose interruption due to any reason was 1.4% (82 interruptions out of a total of 5715 
infusions).  
In IKd arm, out of the 81 (45.8%) patients with IRs, 78 (44.1%) patients had IRs reported as induced by 
isatuximab, including 3 patients with IRs reported as induced by both isatuximab and carfilzomib. Three 
other patients had IRs reported as induced by carfilzomib alone. One patient in IKd group experienced 
Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and another patient in IKd group experienced Grade 2 
hypersensitivity. In IKd arm, the most frequent IR symptoms (in ≥5% of patients) were cough (11.3%), 
dyspnea and (10.2%), nasal congestion (10.2%), vomiting (6.8%), and nausea (6.2%). 
In study EFC15246, all 177 (98.9%) treated patients in the IKd arm and 23 (18.7%) patients in the Kd 
arm received medications reported as IR prophylactic medication (in addition to IMP dexamethasone). In 
addition, 7 patients in IKd arm and 2 patients in Kd arm received GCSF/GMCSF for IR prophylaxis.  
Most patients in both arms had at least 1 TEAE within 24 hours of isatuximab or carfilzomib 
administration (92.1% in IKd arm and 91.0% in Kd arm for all grades; 50.3% and 37.7% for Grade≥3). 
Treatment-related TEAEs within 24 hours of infusion were reported in 81.9% of patients in IKd arm and 
74.6% of patients in Kd arm (31.6% versus 27.0% for Grade ≥3). The most frequent TEAEs within 24 
hours of infusion (in >15% of patients) included infusion related reaction (44.6% in IKd arm versus 3.3% 
in Kd arm), hypertension (28.2%, 23.0%), diarrhoea (21.5%, 15.6%), fatigue (23.7%, 11.5%), 
dyspnoea (20.9%, 16.4%), insomnia (16.9%, 18.9%), and upper respiratory tract infection (16.4%, 
7.4%), which is consistent with the overall safety profile of isatuximab and carfilzomib. 
TEAEs from the “Hypersensitivity and CRS” CMQ were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (55.4%) 
than in the Kd group (16.4%); the difference was primarily driven by infusion related reaction which 
occurred more frequently in the IKd arm (44.6% versus 3.3%). Most of these TEAEs started within 24 
hours of isatuximab or carfilzomib infusion (52.0% versus 11.5%). Majority of these TEAEs were 
treatment-related (49.2% versus 8.2%); and almost all were Grade 1 or 2 except for 4 patients with 
Grade ≥3 events (3 in IKd arm and 1 in Kd arm). Besides infusion related reaction, rash was the second 
most frequent TEAE from the “Hypersensitivity and CRS” CMQ, reported in 12 (6.8%) patients in IKd arm 
and 6 (4.9%) patients in Kd arm (8 [4.5%] versus 3 [2.5%] within 24 hours of infusion). One patient in 
IKd arm experienced a Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and another patient in IKd arm experienced a 
Grade 2 hypersensitivity. Both events occurred within 24 hours of infusion and both were considered 
treatment-related.

Cardiac and vascular disorders AEs 
Overall, the addition of isatuximab to Kd did not increase the incidence of TEAEs (both all grades and 
Grade ≥3) in cardiac CMQ (ie, cardiac disorders SOC), in cardiac failure SMQ (narrow), in ischemic heart 
disease SMQ (narrow), in embolic and thrombotic events (venous and arterial) SMQ (narrow), and in 
cardiac arrhythmias HLGT. TEAEs belonging to cardiac disorders SOC were reported with similar 
incidences in IKd and Kd arms (23.7% versus 22.1% for all grades; 7.3% versus 7.4% for Grade ≥3). 
Congestive cardiac failure (ie, congestive heart failure [CHF]) was reported in 3 (1.7%) patients in the 
IKd arm (none in Kd arm). Pulmonary edema was reported in 1 (1.0%) patient in the Kd arm (none in 
IKd arm). Two of the 3 patients with CHF had relevant medical history of hypertension (for 1 patient) and 
emphysema and smoking (for another patient), while the third patient with CHF had no relevant medical 
history. The patient with pulmonary edema had medical history of asthma and type 2 diabetes.  There 
were no TEAEs in cardiomyopathy SMQ (narrow) reported in this study. 
TEAEs in vascular hypertensive disorders HLGT (all grades) were reported with higher incidence in the IKd 
arm than in the Kd arm. The incidence of patients with hypertension (all grades) was 36.6% in the IKd 
arm versus 30.4% in the Kd arm in patients without prior history, and 38.1% versus 32.6% in patients 
with prior history. Overall, the incidence of all grade hypertension was 36.7% in IKd arm versus 31.1% in 
Kd arm. The incidence of Grade ≥3 hypertension, however, was similar between the 2 arms: 20.3% in IKd 
versus 19.7% in Kd. Two patients, 1 in each arm, experienced hypertension crisis. No patient in IKd arm 
had definitive treatment discontinuation due to hypertension, while 2 patients in Kd arm had hypertension 
leading to definitive treatment discontinuation. Regarding the observed >5% difference between the IKd 
and Kd arms in all grade hypertension assessments of the mean and standard deviation of systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure over the course of the study did not reveal a difference between the two arms. 
Thromboembolic events, venous or arterial, were reported with slightly lower incidence in the IKd arm 
than in the Kd arm (15.3% versus 16.4% for all grades; 4.0% versus 5.7% for Grade ≥3). Most 
thromboembolic events were venous events (13.6% and 14.8% in IKd and Kd groups, respectively). The 
most frequently reported venous events were thrombophlebitis superficial (5.1% and 5.7%; no Grade ≥3) 
and deep vein thrombosis (4.5% and 8.2%; with 1.6% in Kd group Grade ≥3). Pulmonary embolism was 
the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 venous event (2.3% and 2.5%). The incidence of arterial 
thromboembolic events was also slightly lower in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (1.7% versus 3.3% for 
all grades; 1.1% versus 2.5% for Grade ≥3). The reported arterial events (all grades) included acute 
myocardial infarction (0.6% versus 0.8%), coronary artery occlusion (0.6% in IKd), peripheral arterial 
occlusive disease (0.6% versus 0.8%), ischemic stroke (1.6% in Kd), and peripheral embolism (0.8% in 
Kd). 
Infections 
Overall, TEAEs in the SOC Infections and infestations were reported in 86.4% and 80.3% of patients in 
the IKd and Kd arms, respectively. Most infections were in the HLGT“ infections - pathogen unspecified”  
(83.1% in IKd group and 76.2% in Kd group). The most frequently reported infections (all grades) in 
either arm were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Serious infections were 
reported in 37.9% and 30.3% of patients in the IKd and Kd arms, respectively (33.9% and 26.2% for 
Grade ≥3). When adjusted for exposure, the difference in serious infections between the 2 arms was 
reduced but remained higher in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (0.38 versus 0.33 event per PY). Most 
infections TEAEs (respiratory infections included) were reversible and manageable with supportive care 
(prophylaxis or curative) and few resulted in definitive treatment discontinuation (2.8% of patients in IKd 
arm and 4.9% in Kd arm). Infections with fatal outcomes not in the context of disease progression 
occurred to 4 patients in IKd arm and 1 patient in Kd arm. One patient in Kd arm (and no patient in IKd 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021

group) reported hepatitis B reactivation. Two patients in the IKd arm had primary infections of hepatitis B 
virus. 
The addition of isatuximab to Kd increased the incidence of respiratory infections, both all grades (83.1% 
versus 73.8%) and Grade ≥3 (32.2% versus 23.8%), driven by higher incidence of upper respiratory 
infection (36.2% versus 23.8%) and bronchitis (22.6% versus 12.3%) in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm. 
Pneumonia was reported in 23.7% of patients in IKd arm and 19.7% of patients in Kd arm. 
Lower respiratory TEAEs 
In study EFC15246, lower respiratory TEAEs excluding infections (in“ lower respiratory events” CMQ) 
were reported more frequently in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (46.3% versus 36.1% all grades; 9.0% 
versus 3.3% Grade ≥3), with dyspnea and cough being the main contributors to the imbalance. Of the 9 
patients with Grade ≥3 dyspnea in the IKd arm, 4 had a history of respiratory disease or as evidenced by 
the medical history or the use of respiratory medications.  
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) were reported in 13 (7.3%) patients in IKd arm and 6 (4.9%) 
patients in Kd arm. All SPMs were solid tumours (skin cancers or non-skin solid tumours). There were no 
haematologic malignancies reported in either arm. Skin cancers as SPM were reported in 9 (5.1%) 
patients in IKd arm and 3 (2.5%) patients in Kd arm. Among the 12 patients with skin cancers, medical 
history of skin cancer(s) was reported in 3 patients (all in IKd arm). All patients with skin cancers were 
able to continue in the study after resection. Other solid tumours as SPM (other than skin cancers) were 
reported in 5 (2.8%) patients in IKd arm and 4 (3.3%) patients in Kd arm. Among them, 4 patients 
discontinued study treatment due to SPMs (3 in IKd arm and 1 in Kd arm).  
Neutropenia and neutropenic complications 
In study EFC15246, the overall incidence of patients with Grade 3 neutropenia (regardless of baseline 
status) was higher in the IKd arm (17.5%) than in the Kd arm (6.6%). The incidence of Grade 4 
neutropenia was low and similar between the two arms (1.7% versus 0.8%). The incidence of Grade 3 
neutropenia was higher among patients with pre-existing Grade 2 neutropenia at baseline, as compared 
to patients with lower grade or no neutropenia at baseline. Compared to IPd combination, the IKd 
combination had much lower rate of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, especially Grade 4 neutropenia. In study 
EFC15246, neutropenia events were well managed with supportive care and were reversible in most 
subjects with few cases of neutropenic complications. No patients had definitive treatment discontinuation 
due to neutropenia or neutropenic complication. Neutropenic complications were experienced by 5 (2.8%) 
patients overall, 2 (1.1%) with febrile neutropenia and 3 (1.7%) with neutropenic infection 
(gastroenteritis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis), all in IKd arm. Three patients with neutropenic 
complications (2 with febrile neutropenia and 1 with neutropenic infection) received GCSF/GMCSF. One 
patient in IKd arm had premature discontinuation of carfilzomib due to neutropenia. 
Thrombocytopenia 
The incidences of patients with Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory thrombocytopenia were similar between 
the IKd and Kd arms (18.6% versus 15.6% for Grade 3; 11.3% versus 8.2% for Grade 4), and were 
higher among patients with pre-existing thrombocytopenia (Grade 1 or 2) at baseline as compared to 
patients with no abnormality at baseline. Thrombocytopenia as a TEAE was reported with lower incidence 
in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (5 [2.8%] versus 12 [9.8%] all grades; 2.3% versus 8.2% Grade ≥3). 
Thrombocytopenia TEAE led to 1 definitive treatment discontinuation in the Kd arm (and none in IKd

arm). There were no cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome 
reported.  
Overall, haemorrhages (all grades) were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (19.8%) than in the Kd 
arm and (12.3%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 haemorrhages was low. Five patients experienced Grade 
3 haemorrhages (4 [2.3%] in IKd arm and 1 [0.8%] in Kd arm). One patient in IKd arm experienced a 
Grade 4 haemorrhage. Haemorrhages following Grade 4 thrombocytopenia were reported in 4 (2.3%) 
patients, all in the IKd arm (Grade 1 haemorrhage in 1 patient, Grade 2 in 2 patients, and Grade 3 in 1 
patient). There appeared to be no correlation between Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and haemorrhages. 
Interference with cross-matching and red blood cell antibody screening 
Because anti-CD38 antibody treatment has the potential to interfere with the indirect antiglobulin test 
(IAT, also known as indirect Coombs test) performed for blood bank typing, patients in the IKd arm in 
EFC15246 and those in the IPd arm in EFC14335 underwent IAT testing during screening, and were 
tested again at least once during treatment. In study EFC15246, IAT was performed in 168 (94.9%) 
patients at baseline and 162 (91.5%) patients during the treatment period in the IKd arm.  
A positive Coombs test was perfomed in 94.9% (168 patients) at baseline and 91.5% (162 patients) 
during the treatment period in the IKd arm. In the IKd arm, a positive Coombs test was reported during 
study treatment in 95 of the 150 patients (63.3%) with both a negative test at baseline and at least one 
test during study treatment. No haemolytic disorder was reported in patients with positive indirect 
Coombs receiving red blood cell transfusions.  
Laboratory findings 
Overall, the majority of patients in both IKd and Kd arms experienced some degree of laboratory 
anaemia, lymphopenia (lymphocyte count decreased), and thrombocytopaenia (platelet count decreased) 
(Table 33). The overall incidences (all grades) were similar between the two arms, but the incidences of 
Grade 3 neutropenia was higher in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm. No patients in either arm experienced 
Grade 4 anaemia. The majority of patients in both arms with anaemia during on-treatment period had 
pre-existing anaemia at baseline. The IKd arm had more patients with pre-existing Grade 3 anaemia (13 
[7.3%]) than the Kd arm (4 [3.3%]).

Table 33 Hematology - Abnormalities during the on-treatment period (worst grade per patient) 
Clinical chemistry in metabolism and electrolytes were generally similar between the IKd and Kd arms 
(Table 34). Most of the abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, Grade 3 
hyponatremia, and Grade 3 hypophosphatemia were noted with higher incidence in the IKd arm than in 
the Kd arm: 6.1% versus 2.9% for hyperglycemia; 7.9% versus 4.1% for hyponatremia; 9.7% versus 
5.8% for hypophosphatemia. The incidence of Grade 4  abnormalities was very low (<2% in either arm).

Table 34 Metabolic function - Abnormalities during the on-treatment period (worst grade per patient) 
Liver function: The IKd and Kd arms were similar in the overall incidences of ALT increased and AST 
increased (all grades). The incidence of Grade 3 ALT increased was 4.0% in IKd arm and 2.5% in Kd arm. 
The incidence of Grade 3 AST increased was 4.0% and 0.8% in IKd and Kd arms, respectively. One 
patient in IKd arm experienced a transient Grade 4 ALT increased. The IKd arm had lower incidence of 
Grade 2 blood bilirubin increased than the Kd arm (4.5% versus 12.3%). One patient in IKd arm 
experienced a Grade 3 blood bilirubin increased, which did not meet the criteria for Hy’ s Law. There was 
higher incidence of Grade 1 ALP increased in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm (28.2% versus 19.7%). This 
may be hypothesised to be of bone rather than of liver origin within the context of tumour response, as 
has been observed with other active myeloma agents. 
Renal function:  The addition of isatuximab to Kd did not result in an increase in renal dysfunction. 
Compared to the Kd arm, the IKd arm had similar or lower incidences of renal impairment (based on 
eGFR [MDRD]), creatinine increased, and hyperuricemia at each grade. This may be attributed to better 
myeloma control in the IKd arm leading to less renal dysfunction. End-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 
mL/min/1.73m2) was reported in 3 (1.8% of 163) patients in the IKd arm and 3 (2.7% of 110) patients 
in the Kd arm. Of note, race was not reported for 14 patients in IKd arm and 12 patients in Kd arm due to 
legal considerations and eGFR was therefore not calculated for these patients. Of the 6 patients with end-
stage renal disease during study treatment, 3 in IKd arm and 1 in Kd arm recovered to at least baseline 
status. End-stage renal disease occurred in the context of an AE to 1 patient in the IKd arm (bronchitis) 
and 2 patients in the Kd arm (hypertension with cardiac failure for one patient; urinary tract infection 
with pulmonary infection for another patient), in the context of disease progression to 1 patient in the IKd 
arm, and in the context of and AE and disease progression to 1 patient in the IKd arm (flu like syndrome 
with diarrhoea) and 1 patient in the Kd arm (fatal pneumonia with septic shock). In TEAEs related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 78/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
renal toxicity, the IKd arm had a lower incidence of TEAEs in the HLT of renal failure and impairment than 
the Kd arm: 5.1% versus 8.2% all grades; 1.1% versus 2.5% Grade ≥3. The IKd arm had lower incidence 
of acute kidney injury than the Kd arm (2.8% versus 5.7%). 
Safety in special populations 
Age groups 
In both the IKd and Kd arms the incidence of Grade ≥3 increased with age and incidence of serious TEAEs 
was higher in patients ≥65 years old. Definitive treatment discontinuations only increased by age in the 
Kd arm. In the IKd arm, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of carfilzomib also increased with 
increasing age. A similar profile in TEAE overview was observed in subgroups by increasing age versus 
the overall safety population presented by a higher incidence of patients with Grade ≥3 TEAEs, but this 
did not result in an increase in the incidence of patients with serious TEAEs, fatal TEAE during study 
treatment, or TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in the IKd arm versus the Kd arm. 
Table 35 Overview of TEAEs by age - EFC15246 - Safety population 
Gender 
No consistent trends by gender were observed for the incidence of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and treatment-
related serious TEAEs. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred at a higher incidence in males in the IKd arm (80.8%) 
than in the female (72.2% KD and 71.8% IKd) with the lowest incidence in males in the Kd arm (63.2%). 
Even though higher incidence of patients with Grade ≥3 TEAEs was observed in males in the IKd arm (not 
in females), this did not result in an increase in the incidence of patients with serious TEAEs, fatal TEAEs 
during study treatment, or TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in the IKd arm compared 
to the Kd arm. 
Race and ethnicity

In general, there did not appear to be any trends in the incidence of TEAEs by race. The incidence of 
Grade ≥3 and Grade 3-4 TEAEs was higher in the IKd arms regardless of race. The incidence of serious 
TEAEs was similar between IKd and Kd arms of Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients, but was lower 
overall in non-Caucasian patients in the IKd (48.5% non-caucasican versus 63.1% caucascian) and Kd 
arms (51.9% non-caucasican versus 60.2% caucascian). There was a higher incidence of patients with 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, but this did not result in an increase in the incidence of patients with serious TEAEs, with 
fatal TEAEs during study treatment, or with TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in the 
IKd arm versus the Kd arm. 
Renal status (<60 mL/min/1.73m2, ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2) 
Among patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred less frequently in the Kd arm 
than in the IKd arm. In the Kd arm, patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 had higher incidence of 
serious TEAEs versus patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 (77.8% versus 54.3%) while in the IKd 
arm, a similar incidence of serious TEAEs was reported in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 and in 
patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 (6.8% versus 59.2%). A similar profile in TEAE overview was 
observed in subgroups by renal function to the overall TEAE overview in safety population. There was a 
higher incidence of patients with TEAEs Grade ≥3 for patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 in the IKd 
arm (not for patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2), but it did not result in an increase in the incidence 
of patients with serious TEAEs, with fatal TEAE during study treatment, or with TEAE leading to definitive 
treatment arm discontinuation. 
Hepatic status 
Although there were few patients with abnormal hepatic function in the IKd and Kd arms (17 and 16 
patients, respectively), there were no trends observed in the incidence of TEAEs in patients based on 
hepatic function, except for a higher incidence of patients with serious TEAEs in the Kd arm with 
abnormal liver function versus with normal liver function in the Kd arm (75.0% versus 54.7%). 
A similar profile in TEAE overview was observed in subgroups by liver function versus the TEAE overview 
in the overall safety population. There was a higher incidence of patients with TEAEs Grade ≥3, but not for 
patients with abnormal hepatic function, which was slightly lower in the IKd arm. This did not result in an 
increase in the incidence of patients with serious TEAEs, with fatal TEAEs during study treatment, or with 
TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in the IKd arm versus the Kd arm. 
Extrinsic factors 
Overall, in all isatuximab treated patients, there were no marked and consistent differences across 
different geographic regions (Western and Eastern Europe [N=359], North and South America [N=489], 
Asia [N=81], and Other countries [N=118]) in the incidences of TEAEs (any grades, Grade ≥3, by SOC 
and PT, Grade 5 with fatal outcome, serious, leading to treatment discontinuation, treatment-related) and 
the incidences of Other important AEs (IRs, lower respiratory and respiratory infections, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia). In all isatuximab treated patients, there were approximately equal number of 
patients who received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy (N=508) and those who received >3 prior lines of 
therapy (N=522). 
There were no marked and consistent differences between the two groups by prior lines of therapy in the 
incidences of TEAEs (any grades, Grade ≥3, by SOC and PT, Grade 5 with fatal outcome, serious, leading 
to treatment discontinuation, treatment-related) and the incidences of Other important AEs (IRs, lower 
respiratory and respiratory infections, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Definitive treatment discontinuation was defined as discontinuation of all study medications or the last 
ongoing study drug. The incidence of patients with TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation 
was lower in the IKd arm (15 [8.5%]) than in the Kd arm (17 [13.9%]) (Table 36).  
Premature discontinuation of isatuximab due to TEAE was reported in 1 (0.6%) patient (infusion related 
reaction) (≤ grade 3). Premature discontinuation of carfilzomib due to TEAEs was reported in 26 (14.7%) 
patients in IKd arm and 1 (0.8%) patient in Kd arm. Cardiac disorders TEAEs were the main reason for 
premature carfilzomib discontinuation (7.3% in IKd arm), with cardiac failure PT being the most frequent 
(5 [2.8%]) (Table 37). Premature discontinuation of dexamethasone due to TEAEs occurred to 6.2% of 
patients in the IKd arm and 3.3% of patients in the Kd arm.

Dose reduction/omission of isatuximab due to TEAEs was reported in 53.1% of patients in the IKd arm, 
most frequently due to TEAEs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations (with upper respiratory tract 
infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia being the most frequent). Other TEAEs leading to isatuximab dose 
reduction/omission (in ≥2% of patients) included hypertension dyspnea, and asthenia (each with 4 
[2.3%] patients). Dose interruption (ie, infusion interruption) of isatuximab due to TEAEs occurred in 
32.8% of patients in IKd arm, primarily due to infusion related reactions (29.9%). 
Carfilzomib dose reductions/omissions due to TEAEs were reported in 67.2% of patients in the IKd arm 
and 75.4% of patients in the Kd arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to carfilzomib dose 
reduction (≥10% in either group) were upper respiratory tract infection (12.4% in IKd arm and 9.8% in 
Kd arm) and hypertension (11.9%, 14.8%). Carfilzomib dose interruptions due to TEAEs occurred in 7 
(4.0%) patients in the IKd arm and 2 (1.6%) patients in the Kd arm, mainly due to TEAEs in the General 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC (administration site extravasation and infusion site 
extravasation for 2 patients each in IKd arm, and infusion site erythema and infusion site pain for 1 
patient each). One patient each in both IKd and Kd arms had carfilzomib interruption due to infusion 
related reaction. No patient had a carfilzomib infusion interruption due to a Grade ≥3 TEAE.  
Dexamethasone dose reductions/omissions due to TEAEs were reported in 75.1% of patients in the IKd 
arm and 77.0% of patients in the Kd arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to dexamethasone 
dose reduction (≥10% in either arm) included upper respiratory tract infection (13.0% in IKd arm and 
10.7% in Kd arm), insomnia (11.9%, 8.2%), bronchitis (10.7%, 6.6%), pneumonia (10.2%, 9.8%), and 
hypertension (7.3%, 13.9%). Dose interruption was not applicable to dexamethasone when given orally.  
Dose delay of any drug due to TEAEs was reported more frequently in the IKd arm (59.9%) than in the 
Kd arm (45.1%). The most frequent TEAEs leading to dose delay of any drug was in the SOC of Infections 
and Infestations. 
Supportive study TCD12795 
Safety data from the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1b TCD12795 study for isatuximab-
carfilzomib combination are presented (cut-off May 2020). In total, 33 patients received isatuximab and 
carfilzomib (27 mg/m2), without dexamethasone, at 3 isatuximab dose regimens (10 mg/kg Q2W, 10 
mg/kg QW/Q2W, and 20 mg QW/Q2W), including 24 patients at the 10 mg/kg QW/Q2W dose regimen 
used in the pivotal EFC15246 study. Per the study protocol, all patients had at least 2 prior lines of 
therapy and had confirmed disease progression or were refractory to their last prior line of therapy. At 
the time of data cut-off, 4 patients remained on-treatment and 28 patients had discontinued study 
treatment due to disease progression with a median duration of follow-up of 26.7 months (range 13.3 to 
61 months). 
No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in this study. There were no treatment-related deaths or 
treatment discontinuations due to an AE. The most common Grade 3 or 4 AEs were lymphopenia (55%), 
hypertension (15%), anaemia (9%), and neutropenia (9%). One patient experienced a Grade 3 deep vein 
thrombosis, but there were no other severe haematologic, vascular or cardiac AEs. 
There were IRs reported in 18 patients (55%), with the majority occurring during the first infusion (17 of 
18) and most attributed to isatuximab (17 of 18). These AEs were mostly Grade 1-2 (only 1 Grade 3), 
and did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any patient. Ten patients experienced 12 SAEs, all due to 
infection: upper respiratory infection (6 patients), gastroenteritis (2 patients), pneumonia (2 patients), 
febrile neutropenia (1 patient), and hepatitis B reactivation (1 patient). All SAEs resolved with appropriate 
treatment and all patients resumed study treatment.

Pooled Analysis (All ISA-pool) 
The pooled analysis safety dataset contains the supportive safety data from the initial dossier (submitted 
to FDA and EMA on 30 April 2019 and approved by FDA on 2 March 2020 and by EMA on 30 May 2020) 
(N=576), plus new data from EFC15246 and 5 additional company-sponsored MM studies (TED10893 
Phase 2 Stage 2, TED14154 Part B, TED14095, TCD14079 Part B, and TCD14906). The integrated 
supportive safety dataset does not include data from studies or parts of studies that are still ongoing at 
the dossier cut-off date (i.e. 7 company-sponsored MM studies and 4 company-sponsored non-MM 
studies, and 5 investigator-sponsored studies [4 MM studies and 1 non-MM study]) (Table 38). For 
ongoing studies, only the serious adverse event (SAE) data collected in the pharmacovigilance database 
up to the common technical document (CTD) SAE cut-off date (07 February 2020) are provided in the 
CTD.

Table 38 Summary of completed company-sponsored studies (or parts of studies) 
The safety population in All-Isa pool consisted of 1047 patients in total, all of whom received isatuximab 
treatment, either in combination with Kd (n=177) or with Pd (n=244), or as single-agent with or without 
dexamethasone (n=477), or in other combination therapies (not separately listed and discussed in this 
SCS). Of all 1047 patients in the All-Isa pool, 27.3% were still ongoing with study treatments at the 
cutoff date for this SCS (Table 39). In IKd group, 52.5% of the patients were still ongoing. The leading 
reason for definitive treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (56.0% overall, 29.4% in the IKd 
group). The incidence of definitive treatment discontinuation due to AEs was similar across the IKd, IPd,

Isa (+/-Dex), and All groups (8.5%, 7.4%, 6.7%, and 8.0%, respectively). Adverse event was the reason 
for all premature discontinuation of at least one study drug (isatuximab or other) reported so far. The 
category of “ Other reason” for discontinuations was reviewed and found to be predominantly related to 
Investigators decision, patient decision/withdrawal of consent, or unconfirmed disease progression. 
Table 39 Disposition of patients - All-Isa pool - safety population 
Exposure 
Of all 1047 patients in the All-Isa pool, 27.3% were still ongoing with study treatment at the cutoff date. 
The leading reason for definitive treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (56.0% overall, 
29.4% in IKd group). The incidence of definitive treatment discontinuation due to AEs was similar across 
the IKd, IPd, Isa(+/-Dex), and All groups (8.5%, 7.4%, 6.7%, and 8.0%, respectively). 
Overall, a total of 9273 isatuximab infusions were administered to the 1047 patients in the All-Isa pool. 
The median number of cycles started per patient was 7.0 and the median duration of isatuximab 
exposure was 26.14 weeks. The number of patients having at least 12 months, at least 18 months, and 
more than 24 months of isatuximab treatment was 288 (27.5%), 128 (12.2%), and 15 (1.4%), 
respectively. Comparing with the IPd group, the IKd group had greater isatuximab exposure with more 
cycles started (median number of cycles started: 19.0 versus 10.0), longer duration of exposure 
(median: 79.86 versus 41.00 weeks), and more patients having at least 12 and 18 months of isatuximab 
treatment (121 versus 67 for at least 12 months, 91 versus 7 for at least 18 months). The Isa(+/-Dex) 
group, in comparison to the IKd and IPd groups, had much less isatuximab exposure in median number of 
cycles started (median 4) and median duration of exposure  (median: 15.71 weeks). The percentage of 
patients with at least 1 isatuximab infusion omitted or infusion interrupted was generally comparable 
between the IKd group and the IPd group. 
TEAE 
An overview of TEAEs in All-Isa pool is presented in Table 40. Treatment-related TEAEs (any grade) were 
reported in 78.6% of patients, Grade ≥3 TEAEs in 67.7% (36.6% treatment-related), serious TEAEs in 
50.6% (18.2% treatment-related), TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in 7.8%, and 
Assessment report

TEAEs with fatal outcome during the treatment period in 73 (7.0%) patients (5 [0.5%] treatment-
related). IRs (any IR, excluding symptoms) were reported in 44.3% (2.2% Grade ≥3). 
Compared to the IPd group, the IKd group had notably lower (more than 5% lower) incidence in 
treatment-related TEAEs (86.4% versus 93.4%), any Grade ≥3 TEAEs (76.8% versus 84.4%), treatment-
related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (49.2% versus 70.1%), AESIs (0.6% versus 20.5%), treatment-related serious 
TEAEs (24.9% versus 33.2%), and TEAEs with fatal outcomes (3.4% versus 9.0%) (Table 40). 
Compared to the IKd and the IPd groups, the Isa(+/-Dex) group had lower incidence in treatment-related 
TEAEs (66.5%), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (54.5%), treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (13.0%), and treatment-
related serious TEAEs (7.8%), but higher incidence in AESIs (44.0%). The higher incidence of AESIs was 
probably because in EFC14335 and EFC15246 only IRs of Grade ≥3 were considered AESIs. 
Table 40 Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events - All-Isa pool - safety population
Most frequent TEAEs by SOC and PT 
In all isatuximab treated patients, the most frequent SOCs with TEAEs (in ≥30% of patients) were 
Infections and infestations (67.7% of patients), General disorders and administration site conditions 
(56.8%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (54.5%), Gastrointestinal disorders (52.4%), 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (52.0%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(42.2%), Nervous system disorders (39.0%), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (30.0%). The 
most frequent SOCs with Grade ≥3 TEAEs (≥10% of patients) were Infections and infestations (27.5% of 
patients), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (25.7%), and General disorders and administration site 
conditions (11.1%) (SCS Table 32). Compared to the IPd group, the IKd group had notably lower (≥10% 
lower) incidence of TEAEs in the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic system disorders (14.1% versus 59.0%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021

primarily driven by high incidence of neutropenia in the IPd group), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (48.6% versus 63.1%), and Nervous system disorders (39.0% versus 50.4%). The IKd group 
had higher (≥10% higher) incidence of TEAEs in the SOCs of Vascular disorders (46.3% versus 17.2%, 
primarily driven by high incidence of hypertension in IKd group) and Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (62.7% versus 52.5%). 
At the PT level, the most frequent TEAEs (in ≥15% of all isatuximab treated patients) were: infusion 
related reactions (44.3%), fatigue (27.7%), diarrhea (26.9%), upper respiratory infection (25.8%), 
nausea (18.5%), back pain (18.4%), cough (16.0%), neutropenia (15.9%), and pneumonia (15.4%). 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs (≥5% of patients) were neutropenia (14.9%), pneumonia (11.5%), 
anemia (8.1%), and thrombocytopenia (7.1%), and hypertension (5.2%).  
The notable TEAEs with higher incidences (≥5% higher) in the IKd and the IPd groups than in the single-
agent Isa(+/-Dex) group (SCS Table 32) included: Upper respiratory tract infection (36.2% in IKd group 
and 33.2% in IPd group versus 18.0% in Isa(+/-Dex) group), diarrhea (36.2% and 29.1% versus 
20.3%), pneumonia (23.7% and 22.1% versus 9.6%), bronchitis (22.6% and 18.0% versus 6.7%), 
insomnia (23.7% and 16.8% versus 9.0%), dyspnea (27.7% and 20.9% versus 7.8%), peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (14.1% and 11.5% versus 4.2%), muscle spasms (14.1% and 12.3% versus 3.1%), 
edema peripheral (13.0% and 13.5% versus 8.0%), fall (11.3% and 8.2% versus 3.1%).  
The notable TEAEs with similar incidences between the IKd group and the Isa(+/-Dex) group but different 
(≥5% different) from the IPd group included:neutropenia (4.5% in IKd group and 4.4% in Isa(+/-Dex) 
group versus 48.8% in IPd group), febrile neutropenia (1.1% and 0.6% versus 7.4%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.8% and 6.3% versus 12.3%), infusion related reactions (44.6% and 45.5% versus 38.1%), urinary 
tract infection (6.8% and 5.0% versus 12.7%), dizziness (4.5% and 5.0% versus 10.7%), constipation 
(12.4% and 8.0% versus 22.1%). 
 For Grade ≥3 TEAEs, the IKd group had lower (more than 5%) incidence compared to the IPd group in 
neutropenia (4.0% versus 48.4%), thrombocytopenia (2.3% versus 11.1%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% 
versus 7.4%), and disease progression (0.6% versus 6.1%). The IKd group had higher incidence of 
Grade ≥3 hypertension (20.3% versus 2.5%). The higher incidence of hypertension in IKd group 
compared to the IPd group and the Isa(+/-Dex) group was related to the known side-effect of 
carfilzomib.  
AEs by duration of exposure 
• 
Patients with 24+ months treatment 
As of the data cutoff for the pooled analysis, a total of 15 patients out of 1047 isatuximab treated 
patients had more than 24 months of isatuximab exposure, including 2 in the IKd group, 1 in the IPd 
group, and 8 in the Isa(+/-Dex) group. During the continued isatuximab treatment after the first 24 
months, 8 (53.3%) of the 15 patients had additional TEAEs reported and 2 (13.3%) had Grade ≥3 TEAEs. 
No patients from the IKd and IPd groups had any post-24 months TEAEs. 
Most of the post-24 months TEAEs occurred to no more than 1 patient, except for upper respiratory tract 
infection, back pain, and musculoskeletal chest pain, each with 2 patients. Grade ≥3 TEAEs after 24 
months were reported in 2 patient in the group Isa(+/-Dex) (myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia in 1 
patient and subarachnoid hemorrhage in another). The event of myelodysplastic syndrome was 
considered to be related to study treatment. The event of subarachnoid hemorrhage reported at Cycle 32 
was Grade 5 and the patient died. 
• 
Patients with 18+ months treatment 
A total of 128 patients (out of 1047 all isatuximab treated patients) had more than 18 months of 
isatuximab exposure, including 91 in IKd group, 7 in the IPd group, and 18 in the Isa(+/-Dex) group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 89/105 
 
 
 
 
Overall, majority of patients had TEAEs (any grade and Grade ≥3) during the first 18 months (68.8%) of 
isatuximab treatment and fewer patients had TEAEs after 18 months (14.1%). There were no particular 
TEAEs with markedly higher incidences after 18 months than during the first 18 months. Most of the post-
18 months TEAEs occurred to no more than 1 patient, except 3 cases of pneumonia,  2 cases of anemia, 
3 cases of dyspnoea and 2 cases of traumatic fracture.  
• 
Patients with 12+ months treatment 
A total of 288 patients (out of 1047 all isatuximab treated patients) had more than 12 months of 
isatuximab exposure, including 121 in the IKd group, 67 in the IPd group, and 71 in the Isa(+/-Dex) 
group. Overall, the majority of patients had TEAEs (any grade and Grade ≥3) during the first 12 months 
of isatuximab treatment and fewer patients had TEAEs after 12 months. There were no particular TEAEs 
with markedly higher incidences after 12 months than during the first 12 months. The most frequent 
TEAEs (in ≥5% of patients) occurring after 12 months of isatuximab treatment were upper respiratory 
tract infection (20.1%), diarrhoea (13.9%), fatigue (7.6%), bronchitis (7.3%), cough (6.9%), back pain 
(6.6%), arthralgia (6.3%), and (between 5 to 6%) pneumonia, insomnia, pain in extremity, dyspnea, 
nausea, vomiting, and nasopharyngitis. These TEAEs was also among the most frequent TEAEs with onset 
during ≤12 months of isatuximab treatment. The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs (reported in 3 or more 
patients) with onset after 12 months of isatuximab treatment were pneumonia, hypertension, anemia, 
upper respiratory tract infection, neutropenia, urinary tract infection, insomnia, syncope, dyspnea, 
pathological fracture, traumatic fracture, and viral upper respiratory tract infection.  
SAE 
Serious TEAEs occurred to 50.6% of all isatuximab treated patients, with similar incidences between the 
IKd group (59.3%) and IPd group (60.2%) and lower incidence in Isa(+/-Dex) group (42.6%). The most 
frequent serious TEAE was pneumonia (11.5% overall, with similar incidence between the IKd and the IPd 
group), followed by disease progression (3.9% overall, with much lower incidence in IKd group [0.6%] 
than in IPd group [5.7%]). Treatment-related serious TEAEs were experienced by 191 (18.2%) patients 
overall (24.9% in the IKd group, 33.2% in the IPd group, and 7.8% in the Isa(+/-Dex) group). The most 
frequent treatment-related serious TEAE (any grade, in ≥1% of patients) was pneumonia (4.9%), followed 
by infusion related reaction (2.4%), febrile neutropenia (1.4%), and neutropenia (1.1%). 
Deaths 
Of the 1047 patients treated with isatuximab, 73 (7.0%) patients died during the treatment period (41 of 
73 within 60 days from the first dose of study treatment) and 228 (21.8%) died during the post-
treatment period. Disease progression was the predominant cause of death in the post-treatment period 
(178 of 228 deaths) while AEs and disease progression were comparable contributors to the deaths 
during the treatment period (37 of 73 due to disease progression and 32 of 73 due to AEs). 
Compared to the IPd group and the Isa(+/-Dex) group, the IKd group had lower death rates during both 
treatment period (3.4% versus 9.0% and 6.5%) and post-treatment period (13.6% versus 18.4% and 
28.3%), and lower death rate due to disease progression. Fatal TEAEs or Grade 5 post-treatment AEs 
(including disease progression AE) were reported in 95 (9.1%) patients combined (5.3.5.3 ISS Appendix 
1 [Section 2.4.1.1]); of them, 91 were fatal TEAEs and 4 were Grade 5 post-treatment AEs Of the 91 
patients with fatal TEAEs (5.3.5.3 ISS Appendix 1 [Section 2.4.1.1]), 45 (4.3%) were in the context of 
disease progression, with 1 (0.6%) patient from the IKd group compared to 14 (5.7%) from the IPd 
group and 23 (4.8%) from the Isa(+/-Dex) group. None of the fatal TEAEs in the context of disease 
progression were treatment-related. Of the 91 patients with fatal TEAEs, 46 (4.4%) were not in the 
context of disease progression (9 [5.1%] in the IKd group, 13 [5.3%] in IPd group, and 16 [3.4%] in the 
Isa(+/-Dex) group). The most frequent fatal TEAEs not in the context of disease progression were in the 
Infections and infestations SOC, with sepsis (7 patients) and pneumonia (6 patients) being the most 
Assessment report

frequent, followed by acute kidney injury, sudden death, and death (each with 3 patients) and septic 
shock, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, and respiratory tract infection (each with 2 patients). Seven were 
treatment-related (all in the Infections and infestations SOC) with sepsis being the most frequent 
treatment-related fatal TEAE (3 patients). 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation or modification 
Of all 1047 isatuximab treated patients, 82 (7.8%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to definitive 
treatment discontinuation, with infusion related reaction (18 [1.7%]) being the most frequent, followed 
by pneumonia (6 [0.6%]), sepsis (4 [0.4%]), and death and sudden death (3 [0.3%] each). Across the 3 
subgroups, the incidence of TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation was slightly higher in 
the IKd group (8.5%) compared to the IPd group (7.4%) which in turn was slightly higher than the 
Isa(+/-Dex) group (6.3%). No patients in the IKd group had definitive treatment discontinuation due to 
infusion related reaction compared to 1 (0.4%) patient in the IPd group and 10 (2.1%) patients in the 
Isa(+/-Dex) group. 
Premature discontinuations of isatuximab due to TEAEs were reported in 6 (0.6%) patients overall (1 
[0.6%] in the IKd group, 4 [1.6%] in the IPd group, and 1 [0.2%] in Isa(+/-Dex) group) (5.3.5.3 ISS 
Appendix 1). Premature discontinuations of carfilzomib due to TEAEs were reported in 26 patients overall, 
applicable to the IKd group only (26 [14.7%]), with 13 patients due to TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders 
SOC. Premature discontinuations of dexamethasone due to TEAEs were reported in 21 (2.0%) patients 
overall, with 11 (6.2%) in the IKd group compared to 3 [1.2%] in the IPd group and 2 [0.4%] in the 
Isa(+/-Dex) group). There was no particular pattern in TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of 
dexamethasone. 
TEAEs leading to any dose modification of isatuximab were reported in 65.7% of patients overall (84.7% 
in the IKd group, 81.1% in the IPd group, and 49.1% in the Isa(+/-Dex) group). The most frequent 
TEAEs leading to any dose modification of isatuximab (in ≥5% of patients) were infusion related reaction 
(33.1%), neutropenia (10.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.6%), and pneumonia (8.6%). 
Compared to the IPd group, the IKd group had notably lower (more than 5% lower) incidence of TEAEs 
leading to any isatuximab dose modifications in neutropenia (4.5% versus 33.6%); and notably higher 
incidence (more than 5% higher) in bronchitis (11.9% versus 5.7%) and respiratory tract infection (7.9% 
versus 1.2%). TEAEs leading to dose reduction (ie, dose omission) of isatuximab were reported in 23.9% 
of patients overall (53.1% in the IKd group, 48.4% in the IPd group, and 2.5% in the Isa(+/-Dex) 
group). The most frequent TEAEs leading to isatuximab dose omission were upper respiratory tract 
infection (4.9%), followed by pneumonia (3.4%), and neutropenia (3.2%). TEAEs leading to dose 
interruption of isatuximab were reported in 35.1% of patients overall (32.8% in the IKd group, 34.0% in 
the IPd group, and 34.2% in the Isa(+/-Dex) group). The single most frequent TEAE leading to 
isatuximab dose interruption was infusion related reaction (33.0%). 
TEAEs leading to dose delay of isatuximab were reported in 40.1% of patients overall (57.6% in the IKd 
group, 57.0% in the IPd group, and 24.3% in the Isa(+/-Dex) group). The most frequent TEAEs leading 
to isatuximab dose delays (in ≥5% of patients) were neutropenia (8.9%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(6.7%), and pneumonia (6.0%).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data for this application are provided by study EFC15246. As of the cut- off date (07 
February 2020), the IKd arm had more patients still ongoing with study treatment than the Kd arm 
(52.0% versus 30.9%) and had fewer patients that definitively discontinued study treatments (46.9% 
versus 68.3%). The main reasons for definitive treatment discontinuation (in the randomised population) 
were disease progression (29.1% in the IKd arm versus 39.8% in the Kd arm) and AEs (8.4% versus 
13.8%), with pneumonia, hypertension, neoplasm most frequently leading to a treatment discontinuation. 
In line with this, the overall extent of treatment exposure was greater in the IKd arm compared to the Kd 
arm, with longer duration of treatment and more cycles started per patient (median: 19.0 versus 14.5 
cycles). The percentage of patients with at least 18 cycles of treatment was 57.6% in IKd arm versus 
39.3% in the Kd arm. There is no exposure safety relation. The longer treatment duration on IKd was 
likely a reflection of prolonged disease control compared to Kd. AEs by duration of exposure of IKd was 
provided for < or > 12 months (n=121), < or > 18 months (n=91), < or > 24 months (n=2) which is 
considered sufficient for this application. Overall, the majority of patients had TEAEs (any grade and 
Grade ≥3) occurred during the first 12 months of isatuximab treatment and fewer patients had TEAEs 
after 12, 18 or 24 months. There were no particular TEAEs with markedly higher incidences after 12, 18 
or 24 months of exposure.  
Supportive safety data is provided from completed studies evaluating isatuximab in combination with 
pomalidomide dexamethasone (IPd) or dexamethasone (Id). 
Almost all patients in either the IKd or KD arm experienced an treatment-emergent AE (95.9% vs 
97.2%), most patients experienced an AEs grade ≥3 TEAEs and reported in a higher incidence in the IKd 
arm (76.8%) than in the Kd arm (67.2%). In the majority of patients with a grade≥3 TEAEs, AEs were 
judged as treatment related (treatment-related grade ≥3 TEAEs 47.5% IKd vs 49.2%Kd). Treatment 
emergent SAE were reported in app. 60% of the patients in both arms of which only 25% of patients has 
a treatment related SAE as judged by the investigator.  
The most frequently reported all-grade TEAEs observed with higher incidence (≥10% higher) in the IKd 
arm than in the Kd arm included infusion related reaction (44.6% versus 3.3%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (36.2% versus 23.8%), and bronchitis (22.6% versus 12.3%). The exposure-adjusted 
incidences (events per patient-year) were similar between the IKd and Kd arms for all-grades TEAEs, 
Grade 5 TEAEs, and serious TEAEs. The IKd arm had higher exposure-adjusted incidence than the Kd arm 
for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (1.26 versus 1.05), but lower incidence for TEAEs leading to definitive treatment 
discontinuation (0.07 versus 0.13). 
The most frequently reported serious TEAEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations, with highest 
incidence of PT pneumonia (18.1% in IKd arm versus 11.5% in Kd arms). Other TEAEs with an incidence 
of ≥4% included lower respiratory tract infection (4.0% versus 4.1%) and influenza (0.6% versus 4.1%). 
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs (at PT level; ≥10% of patients in either arm) reported were 
hypertension (20.3% in IKd arm and 19.7% in Kd arm), pneumonia (16.4%, 12.3%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.3%, 8.2%), insomnia (5.1%, 2.5%), and dyspnea (5.1%, 0.8%). 
Overall, the IKd and Kd arms were balanced in the incidences of treatment-related TEAEs (86.4% versus 
80.3% for all grades; 49.2% versus 47.5% for Grade ≥3) with as most frequent treatment-related Grade 
≥3 TEAEs hypertension, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia. The applicant provided details with respect 
to classification of AEs as treatment related as upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, fatigue, 
dyspnoea, bronchitis, cough, and vomiting were not defined as treatment related but were reported ≥5% 
more frequent in IKd arm than in Kd arm. In order to avoid or minimise investigator bias in the context of 
an open label trial,  the safety profile of IKd and Kd was presented in the EFC15246 CSR regardless to

study treatment and importantly the SmPC contains the relevant information and percentages of the ADR 
reported. 
In study EFC15246, 30 [16.9%] patients in IKd arm and 25 [20.5%] patients in Kd arm had died during 
both treatment and post-treatment periods, mostly due to disease progression (18 [10.2%] in IKd arm 
and 19 [15.6%] in Kd arm). The majority of deaths (45 of 55) occurred during the posttreatment period. 
During the treatment period, AE was the cause of death for 5 patients (2.8%) in IKd and 4 (3.3%) 
patients in the Kd arm, during the posttreatment period 1 patient died due to an AE in the IKd arm. Fatal 
TEAEs (other than disease progression) in the IKd arm were pneumonia for 2 patients (atypical 
pneumonia (1 patient), pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (1 patient), cardiac failure for 2 patients, and 
acute kidney injury (1 patient), The AEs with fatal outcome regardless of the assessment are listed in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Compared to other isatuximab combination regimens IKd had lower death rates 
during both treatment period (3.4% versus 9.0% IPd and 6.5% Id) and post-treatment period (13.6% 
versus 18.4% and 28.3%) despite a longer duration of exposure in IKd patients (median 80 weeks) 
compared to IPd patients (median 41.0 weeks) or single-agent Isa(+/-Dex) patients (median 15.7 
weeks). In general the cause of death was similar to other I combination regimens, although numbers are 
too low to allow proper comparison.  
Definitive treatment discontinuation was defined as discontinuation of all study medications or the last 
ongoing study drug. The incidence of patients with TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation 
was lower in the IKd arm (15 [8.5%]) than in the Kd arm (17 [13.9%]) with pneumonia as leading cause 
of discontinuation. More patients with IKd treatment had TEAE leading to premature Carfilzomib 
discontinuation (14.7% vs 0.8%), with cardiac disorders TEAEs as the main reason for premature 
carfilzomib discontinuation (7.3% in IKd arm) and premature dexamethasone discontinuation (6.2% IKd 
and 3.3.% Kd). Subjects in the IKd arm could continue with Id or I monotherapy and patients in the Kd 
arm would proceed to next line treatment. Among 26 (14.7%) patients who prematurely discontinued 
carfilzomib in IKd arm, 19 patients were still on study treatment (Id only) at the time of the interim 
analysis. The rate of discontinuation in the IKd patients appears in line with that observed in the pooled 
analysis for IPd (7.4%) and Id (6.5%). Dose delay of any drug due to TEAEs was reported more 
frequently in the IKd arm (59.9%) than in the Kd arm (45.1%), the most frequent TEAEs leading to dose 
delay of any drug was in the SOC of Infections and Infestations (with upper respiratory tract infection, 
bronchitis, and pneumonia being the most frequent). 
Cardiotoxicity is a known toxicity reported with carfilzomib, the addition of isatuximab to Kd did not 
increase the incidence of TEAEs (both all grades and Grade ≥3) related to cardiotoxicity (23.7% versus 
22.1% for all grades; 7.3% versus 7.4% for Grade ≥3). There were no definitive treatment 
discontinuation due to hypertension in the IKd arm, while 2 patients in Kd arm had hypertension leading 
to definitive treatment discontinuation.  
Infusion reactions (IRs) of any grade occurred in 45.8% of the subjects in almost all cases on the infusion 
day during the first cycle.  All IRs were reversible and Grade 1-2 except for 1 patient who developed a 
Grade 3 IR which led to premature discontinuation of ISA treatment. The IRs were managed with 
premedication and/or with temporary infusion interruption (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Both isatuximab and carfilzomib can induce infusion associated reactions (IARs) or infusion reactions 
(IRs). Therefore, dexamethasone was to be administered prior to isatuximab and/or carfilzomib on the 
days of isatuximab and/or carfilzomib administration (see SmPC section 4.2, 4.4). Also, premedications 
and guidelines and medications to be administered to patients who developed IRs were provided in the 
protocol. 
Isatuximab with Kd caused neutropenia (17.5% Grade 3 and 1.7% Grade 4; versus 6.6% grade 3 and 
0.8% grade 4 for Kd) and increased the risk for infections such as pneumonia and other respiratory 
infections. Neutropenic complications were experienced by 5 (2.8%) patients overall, 2 (1.1%) with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 93/105 
 
 
 
 
febrile neutropenia and 3 (1.7%) with neutropenic infection (gastroenteritis, pneumonia, chronic 
sinusitis), all in IKd arm. The addition of isatuximab to Kd increased the incidence of respiratory 
infections, both all grades (83.1% versus 73.8%) and Grade ≥3 (32.2% versus 23.8%), mainly driven by 
higher incidence of upper respiratory infection and bronchitis. The high occurrence of respiratory 
infections was also found in the ICARIA registrational study (combination with Pomalidomide 
dexamethasone) and described in 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC with similar incidence. Most infections TEAEs 
(respiratory infections included) were reversible and manageable with supportive care (e.g. G-CSF) and 
dose delays, few resulted in definitive treatment discontinuation (2.8% of patients in IKd arm and 4.9% 
in Kd arm). Infections with fatal outcomes not in the context of disease progression occurred to 4 patients 
in IKd arm and 1 patient in Kd arm. The safety information in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 reflects the 
risk for infections, especially respiratory infections, and recommendations for management (including 
management of neutropaenia). 
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (13 subjects (7.3%) 
vs 6 (4.9%) in Kd arm), all SPMs were solid tumours and consisted mainly of skin cancers (9 subjects 
(5.1%) in IKd arm and 3 (2.5%) patients in Kd arm). The incidence of SPM for the combination IKd 
(7.3%) was higher than observed in the IPd (3.3%) or Id (2.9%) even though the population treated with 
IPd /Id was more heavily pre-treated.    SPMs were skin cancers in 9 patients (5.1%) treated with Isa-Kd 
and in 3 patients (2.5%) treated with Kd, and were solid tumours other than skin cancer in 5 patients 
(2.8%) treated with Isa-Kd and in 4 patients (3.3%) treated with Kd. One patient (0.6%) in the Isa-Kd 
group and one patient (0.8%) in the Kd group had both skin cancer and solid tumours other than skin 
cancer (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients with skin cancer continued treatment after resection of 
the skin cancer. Solid tumours other than skin cancer were diagnosed within 3 months after treatment 
initiation in 3 patients (1.7%) treated with Isa-Kd and in 2 patients (1.6%) treated with Kd. 
Haemorrhages (all grades) were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (19.8%) than in the Kd arm 
(12.3%). The incidence of Grade 3 (4 [2.3%] in IKd arm and 1 [0.8%] in Kd arm) or 4 (1 patient in IKd 
arm) haemorrhages was low. There appeared to be no correlation between Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia 
and haemorrhages. 
More grade 3 adverse events with imbalanced laboratory values were reported in the IKd arm compared 
to Kd, e.g. grade 3 hyperglycemia (6.1% versus 2.9%), grade 3 hyponatremia (7.9% versus 4.1%), and 
grade 3 hypophosphatemia (9.7% versus 5.8%). More severe liver function abnormalities (grade 3) were 
reported in the IKd arm (4.0% ALT increased and 4.0% AST increased) then the Kd arm (2.5% for Grade 
3 ALT increased, 0.8% AST increased). One patient in IKd arm experienced a transient Grade 4 ALT 
increase. The difference between IKd and Kd could not be explained by pre-existing baseline values and 
whether these AEs were transient was not presented. A relation between isatuximab and these specific 
laboratory abonormalities has not been found. 
As expected, the incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs increased with age in both the IKd and Kd arms and incidence 
of serious TEAEs was higher in patients ≥65 years old. The pooled isatuximab safety analysis showed that 
there are no major differences across 3 age groups in SOCs of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (<65 years (N=461), 65 
to 74 years (N=423), and ≥75 years (N=163)). In the SOCs of “Infections and infestations”,“Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications”, and “Cardiac disorders”, the incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 
lower (~6% to 3% lower) in the <65 years age group than in the 65 to 74 years and ≥75 years age 
groups and a trend of decrease incidences in any IRs across the age groups was observed: 49.9%, 
41.4%, 36.2% for any IRs in respective age groups. For lower respiratory infection AEs and respiratory 
infection AEs (during and post-treatment), the incidence was similar between the <65 years and 65 to 74 
years age groups and was lower in the ≥75 years age group. Overall, although an increase in Grade ≥3 
AEs was observed with increasing age, a similar TEAE profile was observed, and a similar increase in AEs 
was seen in the control arm, thus this does not raise concerns. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 94/105 
 
 
 
 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the subgroup analyses for race, gender, ECOG PS, renal 
status, and hepatic status. A similar pattern was seen in the Kd arm and therefore no concerns were 
raised. In study EFC15246, a higher incidence of patients with Grade ≥3 TEAEs was observed in males in 
the IKd arm (not in females), but did not result in an increase in the incidence of patients with serious 
TEAEs, fatal TEAEs during study treatment, or TEAEs leading to definitive treatment discontinuation in the 
IKd arm compared to the Kd arm. Additionally, there were no marked differences between the two groups 
by prior lines of therapy in the incidences of TEAEs (any grades, Grade ≥3, by SOC and PT, Grade 5 with 
fatal outcome, serious, leading to treatment discontinuation, treatment-related) and the incidences of 
Other important AEs (IRs, lower respiratory and respiratory infections, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia).  
In summary, the described safety profile for isatuximab presents with as most frequent adverse reactions 
(>20%) neutropenia (46.7%), infusion reactions (38.2i%), pneumonia (30.9%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (28.3%), diarrhoea (25.7%) and bronchitis (23.7%). The most frequent serious adverse 
reactions are pneumonia (9.9%) and febrile neutropenia (6.6%). Warnings and precautions for use are 
presented for infusion reactions (38.2%), grade 3-4 neutropenia reported as laboratory abnormalities 
(84.9%), and neutropenic complications (30.3%), and a higher incidence of infections including grade ≥ 3 
infections, mainly pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis.  
Additional precautions are listed for the interference of ISA with serological testing (indirect antiglobulin 
test) and the interference with determination of complete response due to interference in the 
immunofixation assay. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on data from study EFC15246 (cut- off date: 07 February 2020) it is shown that toxicity increases 
when combining isatuximab with Kd therapy compared to Kd with an increase in Grade ≥3 TEAEs. The 
type of AEs are, in general, as expected based on the working mechanisms of the products used and 
consistent with that of the all-isatuximab treated patients pool with infusion related reactions 
(predominantly Grade 1-2), neutropenia, and (respiratory) infections as the most frequent TEAE. These 
risks are readily managed with routine interventions such as dose modifications of concomitant agents, 
use of growth factors, baseline blood typing, and use of antibiotics/antivirals. 
Overall, the type of AEs are in line with the known toxicity of Kd backbone therapy and anti-CD38 
therapy.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
The MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor changes in the SmPC sections 4.9, 6.3 and 6.6. 
Additionally, editorial changes have been also introduced to the Annex II key elements of the RMMs. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Slovenia and the Netherlands. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
- consultation with target patient groups for adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least two prior therapies was performed for the initial MAA.  
- the updates to the Package Leaflet following the current EoI are minimal and will not affect its 
readability.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Sarclisa in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, is intended for the treatment of patients 
with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Almost all patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who survive initial treatment will eventually relapse and 
require further therapy. The treatment landscape for patients with RRMM is rapidly changing following the 
recent approval of new treatment options. There are several regimens approved in EU as second line 
treatment in RRMM, but further improvement in prolonged disease control is still needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on the first interim analysis of the pivotal study (EFC15246), a randomised, 
open-label, multicenter study comparing the combination of isatuximab with carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone (IKd) versus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In this study 302 patients were included and randomly assigned to 
treatment with I (10 mg/kg QW/Q2W) added to the Kd backbone or Kd backbone alone in a 3:2 ratio, 
stratified according to number of prior lines (1 versus >1), and R-ISS (I or II versus III versus not 
classified). For all three products the dose and dose schedule are the same as for already authorised 
indications. 
The target population consisted of MM patients with measurable disease with at least 1 but no more than 
3 prior lines of therapy. Patients who had primary refractory disease, were refractory to prior anti-CD38 
mAb, with free light chain (FLC) measurable disease only, or had prior carfilzomib treatment were 
excluded from the study. At the data cut off for this interim analysis 168 patients have discontinued study 
treatment (84 [46.9%] in the IKd arm and 84 [68.3%] in the Kd arm and treatment was ongoing for the 
remainder of the subjects. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint PFS: superiority of IKd over Kd was shown in the ITT with a HR of 
0.531 (95% CI: 0.318 to 0.889), and a p value (1-sided stratified log rank test) of 0.0007. The 
robustness of this observation is supported by sensitivity analyses. The median PFS in the Kd arm of 19 
months is consistent with the protocol assumption, and the increase in PFS in IKd arm (median not 
reached, HR <0.6) is considered clinically relevant. In the subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint also 
a positive effect of adding I to Kd backbone was also seen in most (prespecified) subgroups.  
The treatment effect in secondary endpoints TTP and TTNT was consistent with the effect seen in PFS, 
and the charachterasion of the responses indicted that responses are deeper (increased VGPR+, VGRP+ 
+ MRD negativity and CR rate) and more durable in the IKd arm versus the Kd arm (HR < 0.5 for DoR).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 99/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 Based on the available data, no detriment is OS is noted, and PFS2 is indicative for benefit of treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Overall maturity of data is limited (34% of patients in primary analysis and 39% in the analysis 
recommend by of CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1), the median PFS and DoR are not reached for the 
experimental arm and there is a high degree of censoring after 18 month. So further confirmation of the 
treatment effect and in particular on the notion that also PFS2 is improved and that there is no detriment 
on OS is needed. The MAH will submit mature data when available. 
As the curves for PFS seem to separate later, the benefit of adding I to Kd for those patient with rapid 
progression is not as evident. Subgroup analyses focussing on worst prognostic markers was not able to 
explain this apparent disproportional hazard, however subjects with cytogenetic abnormalities seem to 
benefit less from IKd than the overall population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
- In study EFC15246 in 8.4% (IKd) vs 13.8% (Kd) of patients an AE led to treatment discontinuation. AEs 
that most frequently led to a treatment discontinuation were pneumonia, hypertension, neoplasm. 
- Almost all patients in either IKd or KD arm experienced an treatment-emergent AE (95.9% vs 97.2%), 
most of these AEs were grade ≥3 TEAEs and reported in a higher incidence in the IKd arm (76.8%) than 
in the Kd arm (67.2%). The most frequently reported all-grade TEAEs observed with higher incidence (≥
10% higher) in the IKd arm than in the Kd arm were infusion related reaction (44.6% versus 3.3%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (36.2% versus 23.8%), and bronchitis (22.6% versus 12.3%). 
- The most frequently reported serious TEAEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations SOC, with PT 
pneumonia (18.1% in the IKd arm versus 11.5% in the Kd arms). The  most frequently reported Grade ≥
3 TEAEs (at PT level; ≥10% of patients in either arm) reported more often in the IKd arm were 
hypertension (20.3% in the IKd arm and 19.7% in the Kd arm), pneumonia (16.4%, 12.3%), 
thrombocytopenia (2.3%, 8.2%), insomnia (5.1%, 2.5%), and dyspnoea (5.1%, 0.8%). 
- In study EFC15246, 30 [16.9%] patients in the IKd arm and 25 [20.5%] patients in the Kd arm had 
died during both treatment and post-treatment periods, during the treatment period an AE was the cause 
of death for 5 patients (2.8%) in the IKD and 4 (3.3%) patients in the Kd arm and during the post-
treatment period 1 patient died due to an AE in the IKd arm. Compared to other isatuximab combination 
regimens, IKd had lower death rates with similar AEs leading to death, although numbers are too low to 
allow a proper comparison.  
- Cardiotoxicity is a known toxicity reported with carfilzomib, the addition of isatuximab to Kd did not 
increase the incidence of TEAEs (both all grades and Grade ≥3) related to cardiotoxicity (23.7% versus 
22.1% for all grades; 7.3% versus 7.4% for Grade ≥3). 
- Reversible and low grade infusion reactions (IRs) of any grades occurred in 45.8% of the subjects in 
almost all cases on the infusion day during the first cycle. The IRs were managed with premedication as 
stated in the SmPC and/or with temporary infusion interruption. 
- Isatuximab with Kd caused neutropenia (with 17.5% Grade 3 and 1.7% Grade 4) and increased 
infections such as pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Neutropenic complications were observed 
and the addition of isatuximab to Kd increased the incidence of respiratory infections (all grades (83.1%) 
and Grade ≥3 (32.2%), mainly driven by higher incidence of upper respiratory infection and bronchitis. 
Most infections TEAEs (respiratory infections included) were reversible and manageable with supportive 
care (prophylaxis or curative) and few resulted in definitive treatment discontinuation (2.8% of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/186236/2021 
Page 100/105 
 
 
 
 
in IKd arm and 4.9% in Kd arm), no patients had definitive treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia 
or neutropenic complication. The high occurrence of severe respiratory infections was also found in the 
ICARIA registrational study (combination with Pomalidomide dexamethasone). The safety information in 
the SmPC reflects the risk for infections, especially respiratory infections, and recommendations for 
management (including management of neutropaenia). 
- Second primary malignancies (SPMs) were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (13 subjects (7.3%) 
vs 6 (4.9%) in Kd arm), all SPMs were solid tumours and consisted mainly of skin cancers. The incidence 
of SPM for the combination IKd was higher than observed in the IPd (3.3%) or Id (2.9%). 
- Haemorrhages (all grades) were reported more frequently in the IKd arm (19.8%) than in the Kd arm 
(12.3%). The incidence of Grade 3 (4 [2.3%] in the IKd arm and 1 [0.8%] in the Kd arm) or 4 (1 patient 
in IKd arm) haemorrhages was low. There appeared to be no correlation between Grade 3-4 
thrombocytopenia and haemorrhages. 
- There were no patients in the immunogenicity population (168 evaluable patients treated with IKd) 
were ADA-positive, either pre-existing or during the treatment. 
- Within the IKd arm, the safety profile showed some differences in subgroups. The incidence of Grade ≥3 
AEs increased with age with an higher incidence of serious TEAEs in patients ≥65 years old. A similar TEAE 
profile was observed, moreover as a similar increase in AEs was seen in the control arm, this does not 
raise concerns. There were no marked differences between the two groups by prior lines of therapy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
- Second primary malignancies (SPMs) were reported more frequently (7.3%) than previously reported 
for IPd and Id combination regimens and higher than expected from the background incidence of SPMs in 
MM treated patients (between 1.7% and 6.6%). Long term safety including SPMs will be further 
monitored through routine Pharmacovigilance and PSUR reporting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results from the pivotal study show a statistically significant and a clinically relevant improvement of 
PFS in MM patients who have had min 1 and maximal 3 prior lines of therapy are treated with IKd instead 
of Kd (PFS according to definition PEP: HR 0.531 (95% CI 0.318-0.889), p=0.0007, according to EMA 
guidance) HR 0.5725 (95%CI 0.354-0.925, p=0.0012, median PFS not-reached vs 19 months). The 
observed effect size is considered robust in the sense that it is largely independent of the reason for 
censoring and event or stratification rules. The improvement in PFS is seen across all subgroups tested. 
However the non-proportional hazard in the PFS curve suggests that the net effect of the addition to a Kd 
backbone may be less for subjects with early progression (i.e. within 6-9 months after start of 
treatment), and for those with good prognosis treatment effect cannot accurately be determined due to 
the high level of censoring after 18 months.  
The treatment effect is supported by secondary endpoints indicating a deeper and longer response in 
patients treated with IKd when compared to Kd. Based on the available data, no detriment is noted in OS 
and also PFS2 indicates a beneficial effect of the IKd combination.  
Overall, although confirmation on the treatment effect is requested as data is immature, the efficacy of 
treatment seems established, and the IKd combination seems a valuable addition to the treatment 
options for MM patients with measurable MM who have received at least 1 prior line of treatment. 
The addition of I to a Kd backbone results in increased toxicity as is evident from a higher incidence of 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs compared to Kd treatment. However, this did not result in an increase in SAEs, fatal 
events during study treatment, or definitive treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE. Apparently, the 
increased toxicity can be managed with interventions such as dose modifications of concomitant agents, 
use of growth factors, baseline blood typing, and use of antibiotics/antivirals. 
The type of AEs are in general as expected based on the working mechanisms of the drugs and consistent 
with that of the all-isatuximab treated patients pool with infusion related reactions (predominantly Grade 
1-2), neutropenia, and (respiratory) infections as the most common AEs. As already described, 
isatuximab interferes with serological testing (introducing possible false positive reactions in indirect 
antiglobulin tests, antibody detection tests, antibody identification panels, and antihuman globulin (AHG) 
crossmatches) and also interferes with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests 
(interfering with accurate response classification based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 
due to the detection of isatuximab). These interferences are described in the SmPC and educational 
material.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in the target population is 
considered clinically relevant. The safety profile is consistent with that known of isatuximab and the 
background therapy. As the added toxicity of I to a Kd backgound is maneagable and given the 
substantial improvement in PFS the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Sarclisa for the target population is positive, and this variation is approvable.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
An Extension of indication for Sarclisa to add combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. As a 
consequence the sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated. The PL is updated 
accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor changes in the SmPC sections 4.9, 6.3 and 
6.6 and update the details of local representatives. Editorial changes have been also introduced to the 
Annex II key elements of the RMMs. The RMP version 1.2 has been updated. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP  by consensus is of the opinion that Sarclisa is not similar to Blenrep, Darzalex, Farydak, 
Imnovid, Kyprolis, Ninlaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

Update of sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
order to add a warning on the adverse reaction 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) based on a 
cumulative review of fatal cases of TMA during 
treatment with tacrolimus, requested by the PRAC 
following the assessment of the PSUR 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) section 4.4 and 4.5 are 
updated to raise awareness about TMA and highlight that 
concomitant use of tacrolimus with mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor may increase the risk of 
developing TMA. The frequency of TMA is also updated from 
rare to uncommon in section 4.8. 
Information relating to the potential interaction between 
tacrolimus with caspofungin is included in section 4.5. 
Based on post-marketing safety report and literature, 
section 5.2 is updated to add that tacrolimus is metabolized

Analysis of the MAH’s global safety database indicates 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC for both Advagraf 
and Modigraf, to introduce special warnings and 
precautions for use regarding gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforation, QT prolongation and torsade de pointes 
(TdP). As consequence of the addition of QT 
prolongation/TdP in section 4.4 an update for 
recommendation to monitor QT prolongation with 
ECG is introduced in section 4.5 of the SmPC. The 
Package Leaflet is adequately amended in the 
corresponding sections. The MAH takes the occasion 
to do some minor editorial corrections in the SmPC 
II and PL 
cases of GI perforation which have been described in 
patients using tacrolimus. Most of the cases have been 
described having confounding factors indicating that the 
contribution of tacrolimus, even though not to be excluded, 
is not completely clear. As a conservative approach the 
Product Information document has been updated to include 
warnings about this possible event.  
Analysis of the MAH’s Safety Database, literature and 
external database (FDA and WHO) retrieved cases of QT 
prolongation and Torsade de Pointes in patients using 
tacrolimus. Even though only suspected correlation of these 
events has been possible in connection with tacrolimus, 
patients using the drug are usually under concomitant 
treatments or at risk of conditions triggering the QT 
prolongation and the possible torsade de pointes. Therefore

C.I.9.b - Changes to an existing pharmacovigilance 
system as described in the DDPS - Change in the 
global safety data for tacrolimus has shown that 
concomitant use of tacrolimus with protein inhibitors or 
amiodarone results in an increase of its levels. The 
mechanism related to this interaction is mainly reported to 
be due to an inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme which is involved 
in the metabolism of tacrolimus and is inhibited by either 
the protease inhibitors or amiodarone. Therefore, the 
current warning related to the use of tacrolimus together 
with drugs capable of reducing CYP3A4 activity is amended. 
These drugs include in particular protease inhibitors for HIV 
and HCV and amiodarone.

the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Advagraf continued to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and considered that the benefit-
risk profile of Advagraf continued to be favourable. 
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation with unlimited validity.

SmPC and PL 
Review of the available data in the safety database of the 
Package Leaflet. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC 
regarding agranulocytosis and haemolytic anaemia. 
The PIL is updated accordingly. 
MAH concluded that cases of agranulocytosis and 
haemolytic anaemia have been reported in association with 
use of tacrolimus. Regarding agranulocytosis, 36 cases

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
were identified as of October 2010, of which four and 17 
were classified as 'Index' and 'Informative', respectively. 
The reported index and informative cases suggest a 
causative relationship between administration of systemic 
tacrolimus and agranulocytosis. Regarding haemolytic 
anaemia, 67 cases were identified as of October 2010, of 
which one and 21 cases case were classified as 'Index' and 
'Informative', respectively. Based on these cases a possible 
causative relationship between administration of systemic 
tacrolimus and haemolytic anaemia is suggested. The two 
identified adverse reactions were included in the SmPC and 
the PIL and the benefit-risk balance of the product remains 
positive.

tacrolimus, as requested by CHMP. The PIL is not 
affected by this variation. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
events, the MAH was requested to submit a variation to 
include spontaneous abortions in section 4.6 of the SmPC 
to appropriately reflect the post-marketing experience with 
systemic tacrolimus in exposed pregnancies. Pregnancy-
related cases remain under close monitoring and will be 
reported and discussed in the PSURs.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH provided the Signal Evaluation Report for Pure 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC regarding 
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA). The PIL is updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in section 6 of the PIL. 
Red Cell Aplasia for Prograf (systemic tacrolimus). While 
the number of cases are limited, and many of the 27 
reported "informative cases" of PRCA are confounded by 
factors such as co-administration of other medication, 
evidence of parvovirus B19 infection or the presence or 
history of thymoma/myasthenia gravis, the available data 
strongly suggests a causative association between 
exposure to tacrolimus and the development of PRCA. 
Page 17/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, a warning statement has been included in the 
SmPC of all three systemic tacrolimus products (Advagraf, 
Modigraf, Prograf) and the PRCA has been added as an 
adverse reaction in the section "Undesirable effects". 
This application was submitted for a group of 
variations consisting of a Type II variation following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

(prolonged release formulation of tacrolimus to be taken 
once daily) and Prograf (immediate release formulation of 
tacrolimus to be taken twice daily). Thirty-seven (37) of 
these cases were reported in the UK and 37 were 
dispensing errors. In 22 cases, the patient did not take the 
wrong medicinal product or did not follow the wrong 
regimen. Of the 28/50 patients who were administered the 
incorrect formulation or dosage regimen, 9 experienced at 
least one adverse event (14 adverse events were reported 
in total). Of these, 4 were serious adverse events, including 
graft rejection or reduced graft function. Therefore 
warnings have been included in the product information to 
prevent inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised 
switching of immediate- or prolonged release formulations 
of tacrolimus.

(5 female, 19 male). The 12-month graft survival was 
85.3% for Advagraf and 85.6% for Prograf.  
In a second clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety 
of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with 
mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in 667 de novo 
kidney transplant recipients, the event rate for biopsy-
confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after 
transplantation was 18.6% in the Advagraf group and 
14.9% in the Prograf group. The 12 month patient survival 
rates were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf. In 
the Advagraf arm  
10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the Prograf arm 
8 patients died (3 female, 5 male). The 12-month graft 
survival was 91.5% for Advagraf and 92.8% for Prograf.  
For the sake of completeness, data from a third clinical trial 
in renal transplantation submitted and evaluated for the 
initial approval of Advagraf have also now been included in 
section 5.1.

and PL 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).  In the majority of the 
following assessment of the first PSUR (covering the 
period 01.04.07 - 30.09.07). The MAH took the 
opportunity of this variation to update section 9 of 
the Labelling in line with the EMEA/QRD template 
(version 7.2) and to correct minor spelling mistakes 
in the SPC and PL. In addition, the contact details of 
some local representatives have been updated in the 
PL. The MAH also took the opportunity of this 
variation to make linguistic corrections to the SPC, 
Annex II, Labelling and PL, as relevant, for Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. 
32 cases the patients recovered after discontinuation of 
tacrolimus. Given that PRES can be definitely diagnosed 
with neuro-imaging techniques, is reversible if treated, and 
potentially fatal if not, a warning has been included in the 
SPC to make physicians aware of this condition.

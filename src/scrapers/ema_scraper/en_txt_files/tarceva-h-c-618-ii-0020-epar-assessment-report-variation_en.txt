3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptors  (EGFRs)  are  over-expressed  in  a  number  of  tumours,  including 
NSCLC.  Erlotinib  is  an  orally  administered  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI).  It  is  a  small  molecule 
specifically targeting the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR receptor which plays an important role in 
major signalling cellular pathways involved in tumour genesis and tumour growth.  
Erlotinib (Tarceva) has already been approved for 2nd and further line treatment of patients with 
advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC and for maintenance therapy (in patients with SD) after 4 cycles of 1st 
line chemotherapy). Tarceva is also approved in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. 
This application is for an extension of the NSCLC indication to add:  first-line treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations”. 
The  indication  is  based  on  the  results  from  study  ML  20650  (EURTAC),  an  ongoing  Phase  III,  open-
label  trial  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  erlotinib  treatment  in  previously  untreated 
patients with advanced NSCLC who present mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR as well as 
two bibliographic references were also presented as supportive:  
 
  
 
 
 
 
-    A  prospective  study  conducted  by  the  Spanish  Lung  Cancer  Group  (SLCG)  (Rosell  et  al.,  N  Engl  J 
Med  (2009),  361:958-67)  which  screened  for  EGFR  mutations  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and 
treated eligible patients with erlotinib .   
-    A  pooled  analysis  conducted  by  Paz-Ares  et  al.  (Paz-Ares  et  al.,  J.  Cell.  Moll.  Med.  Vol  14,  N01-2, 
2010  pp.51-69)  comparing  the  efficacy  of  first-line  chemotherapy  and  EGFR  TKIs  (erlotinib  and 
gefitinib) in patients with EGFR mutated tumours . 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision (EMEA-000195-PIP0-08) for the following conditions: 
  Non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer 
 On the granting of a class waiver. 
General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
3.2.  Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
The  non-clinical  information  provided  were  extracted  from  scientific  articles  and  mainly  concern 
mutated forms of the EGFR, which have been found expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
tumor tissue in humans, and the differences between the mutated forms and the wild-type EGFR, and 
on the inhibitory potency of erlotinib on these forms of EGFR. 
3. 2. 1.  
Pharmacology  
3. 2. 1. 1. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
The EGFR consists of an extra cellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, an intracellular 
kinase  domain,  and  the  C-terminal  tail.  The  tail  contains  several  tyrosine  residues  which  can  be 
phosphorylated.  
On the cell surface, EGFR exists in a state of equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms: the 
binding  partner  is  either  another  EGFR  (homodimerization)  or  one  of  the  other  family  members 
(heterodimerization).  This  equilibrium  is  shifted  to  the  dimeric  form  in  the  presence  of  ligands,  e.g. 
EGF. These ligands bind to the extracellular domain and stabilize the dimer (Lemmon, MA 2009). 
The kinase domain of EGFR consists of two lobes, one at the C-terminal (C-lobe), and the other at the 
N-terminal  (N-lobe)  with  the  active  site  in  between  the  lobes.  The  kinase  domain  exists  in  two 
conformations, an inactive conformation, where the active site is ‘closed’ for substrates and the active 
conformation where the active site is ‘open’ for substrates.  
In  the  active  conformation  of  the  kinase  domain,  the  C-terminal  tail  bridges  to  the  active  site  of  the 
kinase  domain  and  a  phosphate  group  is  transferred  from  ATP  to  one  of  several  tyrosines  of  the  C-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
terminal  tail.  This  catalytic  cycle  repeats  itself  (ADP  leaves  the  active  site,  a  new  molecule  of  ATP 
enters,  and  again  one  phosphate  group  is  transferred  to  another  tyrosine  on  the  tail).  These 
phosphorylated motifs then recruit various adaptor molecules and thus a variety of signal pathways are 
activated which eventually leads to cell proliferation and survival (Bose R and Zhang X, 2009). 
Erlotinib competes with ATP in its binding pocket, and thus eliminates the phosphorylation step and in 
this way hinders cell proliferation.  
An enzymatic study (Qui C et al., 2009) of the nearly full-length wild-type EGFR protein in active (EGF-
bound)  and  inactive  (cetuximab  inactivated)  forms  demonstrates  that  erlotinib  binds  to  the  activated 
form  of  the  kinase  domain  of  wild-type  EGFR  about  ten-fold  more  tightly  than  to  the  inactive 
conformation. In this way it can efficiently block initiation of the signaling cascade (Table 1).

a wild-type EGFR in the presence of the ligand EGF: the kinase domain is in the active state 
b wild-type EGFR with bound cetuximab: the kinase domain is in the inactive state 
Several experiments indicate that in mutated EGFRs, the kinase domain is preferentially in the active 
conformation (Eck MJ and Yun CH, 2010).  
Another  major  consequence  of  the  activating  mutations  is  that  EGFR  becomes  functional  in  the 
absence of ligands. This was shown in cellular experiments which followed the phosphorylation of EGFR 
and  the  downstream  signaling:  In  cells  containing  wild-type  EGFR  no  phosphorylation  and 
downstream-signaling  is  observed  in  the  absence  of  EGF.  In  cells  which  contain  EGFR  (L858R)  or 
EGFR(del), phosphorylation and signaling occurs constitutively, i.e. in the absence of EGF (Okabe T et 
al., 2007) 
Since these mutations occur in the vicinity of the kinase domain, they influence the binding constants 
of  ATP  and  erlotinib,  and  thus  the  ability  of  erlotinib  to  abrogate  the  signaling  cascade  and  the  cell 
proliferation.  Structurally  the  EGFRs  bearing  activating  mutations  resemble  the  ligand-activated  form 
of wild-type EGFR. Hence it may be expected that similarly the activating mutations may bind erlotinib 
and  ATP  better  than  wild-type  EGFR.  However,  studies  by  Carey  et  al.  using  the  isolated  cytoplasmic 
kinase domain of mutated EGFRs, found that the picture is more complicated (Table 2). 
Surprisingly,  kinetic  studies  using  the  isolated  cytoplasmic  kinase  domain  of  mutated  EGFRs,  found 
that  while  ATP  binds  less  tightly  to  the  mutated  EGFRs,  erlotinib  binds  tighter  (Table  2).  The  ratio 
Ki[erlotinib] / Km[ATP] provides a relative estimate of the inhibitory potency. Thus it is estimated that 
erlotinib  can  inhibit  the  most  common  mutated  forms  of  EGFRs  approximately  10  –  100  fold  more 
efficiently than the wild-type form (Carey et al).

The  sensitivity  of  a  comprehensive  panel  of  EGFR  mutations  toward  erlotinib  was  measured  using 
Ba/F3 cells expressing the activating EGFR mutants (Kancha RK et al, 2009). The mutants caused IL-3 
– independent growth in the Ba/F3 cells, indicating that these mutations lead to a growth advantage in 
vitro. The most abundant mutations are also the most sensitive ones (table 3).

In vivo studies 
The  potential  of  these  activating  mutations  to  cause  lung  cancer  was  shown  in  transgenic  mouse 
models (Politi K et al., 2006). These transgenic mice with doxycycline dependant expression of an exon 
19  deletion  mutant  (EGFR  (del  L747–S752))  or  the  L858R  mutant  (EGFR  (L858R))  in  type  II 
pneumocytes  developed  lung  tumours  within  two  weeks  after  induction  with  doxycycline.  The  mice 
expressing  the  EGFR  (L858R)  allele  showed  diffuse  lung  cancer  highly  reminiscent  of  human 
bronchioloalveolar  carcinoma  and  later  developed  interspersed  multifocal  adenocarcinomas.  In 
contrast,  mice  expressing  EGFR  (del  L747–S752)  developed  multifocal  tumors  embedded  in  normal 
lung  parenchyma  with  a  longer  latency.  With  mice  carrying  either  EGFR  allele,  withdrawal  of 
doxycycline (de-induction of the oncogene expression) caused rapid tumor regression. 
Tumor  bearing  transgenic  mice  expressing  the  exon  19  deletion  mutant  (EGFR(del747–S752))  or  the 
L858R  mutant  (EGFR(L858R))  in  type  II  pneumocytes  under  the  control  of  doxycycline  were  treated 
with  erlotinib  at  doses  of  12.5  mg/kg/day.  Partial  to  complete  responses  evaluated  by  magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (MRI)  was  observed  as  early  as  2  days  after  erlotinib  treatment.  The  amount  of 
tumor  regression  as  assayed  histologically  correlated  with  the  length  of  treatment.  After  2-4  days  of 
study  treatment  tumor  cells  were  still  observed  throughout  the  lung  sections.  Very  few  tumor  cells 
were  detected  in  lung  tissue  from  animals  treated  with  erlotinib  for  >  2  weeks.  Emphysematous 
changes  and  scarring  were  observed  in  the  lungs  of  treated  mice,  presumably  in  areas  where 
adenocarcinomas  were  eliminated  or  were  being  eliminated.  Tumours  in  two  mice  that  were 
heterozygous  for  p53,  generated  in  the  context  of  ongoing  experiments  to  determine  the  effect  of 
tumour  suppressor  gene  deficiencies  on  mutant  EGFR-dependent  tumorigenesis,  also  regressed  upon 
erlotinib treatment  
These results suggest that inhibition of the kinase activity of the mutant receptor is sufficient to elicit 
responses similar to those observed upon de-induction of the EGFR oncogene in transgenic mice and to 
that  observed  after  TKI  treatment  of  most  human  lung  tumors  with  EGFR  mutations.  In  addition,  in 
mice,  both  bronchioloalveolar  carcinoma  and  solid  invasive  adenocarcinomas  respond  to  treatment 
with erlotinib.

Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  MAH  provided  bibliographic  data  to  support  the  efficacy  of  erlotinib  for  the  treatment  of  human 
lung tumours with EGFR mutations.  
The  provided  pharmacology  data  showed  that  erlotinib  has  higher  affinity  and  efficacy  at  the  active 
domain of the mutated EGFR than the wild-type receptor. In-vivo studies in tumour bearing transgenic 
mutant  receptor  mice  treated  with  erlotinib  showed  and  rapid  regression  of  malignant  lung  tumours 
comparable to the effect observed in human lung tumours with EGFR mutations. 
The estimated future environmental exposure in terms of surface water PEC to erlotinib even assuming 
a doubling of the use of erlotinib will be around 100 times lower than estimated in the first ERA and 
similarly for the other dependent PEC values and the risk ratios including the one for sediment. 
Therefore, the justification for not submitting a new ERA in the current application is deemed 
acceptable 
Conclusion 
The available literature describes the higher affinity and efficacy of erlotinib at the active domain of the 
mutated EGFR than the wild-type receptor. No additional non-clinical studies are considered necessary.  
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of lung cancer. Although there has been a gradual 
decrease in the incidence of NSCLC in men, it continues to increase in women. The treatment of NSCLC 
is determined by disease stage. Surgery continues to be the mainstay of treatment for early-stage and 
localized disease. Over 70% patients with NSCLC present at an advanced stage, including patients with 
metastatic  disease  and  those  with  locally  advanced  disease  with  malignant  pleural  or  pericardial 
effusion.  Current  therapeutic  options  for  advanced  stage  patients  have  the  potential  to  palliate 
symptoms  and  extend  survival;  however,  the  disease  is  incurable.  The  median  survival  with  support 
treatment alone (without chemotherapy) is approximately 3-4 months. 
Platinum-based chemotherapy, when given as first-line therapy, modestly prolongs survival compared 
with best supportive care. Several third- generation chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, pemetrexed, 
gemcitabine,  docetaxel,  vinorelbine  and  irinotecan)  have  also  shown  single-agent  activity.  In 
randomized  Phase  III  trials,  these  agents  in  combinations  with  platinum  have  been  associated  with 
improved quality of life (QoL) and modest improvements in survival. However, no doublet regimen has 
proved  superior  and  survival  outcomes  are  poor  (median  survival,  8-10  months;  1  year  survival  rate 
35%  to  40%).  Furthermore,  platinum-based  chemotherapy  is  associated  with  several  life-threatening 
short-term  side  effects  (e.g.  febrile  neutropenia  and  sepsis)  as  well  as  long-term  side  effects.  This  is 
particularly  relevant  for  the  use  of  cisplatin  which  can  cause  neuropathy  that  may  be  exacerbated 
when combined with other potentially neurotoxic agents such as paclitaxel or vinorelbine. Additionally, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there is a sub-set of patients from whom cisplatin-based doublets are not indicated as they have poor 
performance status and are at risk of life-threatening toxicities. 
Advances  in  the  knowledge  of  tumour  biology  and  mechanisms  of  oncogenesis  have  granted  the 
singling  out  of  molecular  targets  for  NSCLC  treatment.  Bevacizumab,  a  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, has been approved in many countries (including the EU) for use in 
combination  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
unresectable advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC on the basis of two phase III randomized 
trials. These represent the first evidence of improvement in treatment outcomes of chemotherapy with 
targeted therapies in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. 
Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptors  (EGFRs)  are  over-expressed  in  a  number  of  tumours,  including 
NSCLC.  The  tyrosine  kinase  domain  of  the  EGFR  receptor  plays  an  important  role  in  major  signalling 
cellular pathways involved in tumour genesis and tumour growth. 
Erlotinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It binds to the intracellular kinase domain 
of  the  EGFR  in  competition  with  ATP.  In  patients  with  mutations  in  the  kinase  domain,  the  binding 
constants  for  ATP  and  erlotinib  are  altered  leading  to  more  tightly  binding  of  erlotinib.  In  result, 
erlotinib  blocks  mutated  EGFR  more  efficiently.  Furthermore,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  tumours 
with  activating  EGFR  mutations  are  more  dependent  on  EGFR  signalling  for  their  proliferation.  In 
consequence,  activating  mutations  in  the  EGFR  gene  confer  hypersensitivity  to  TKIs  and  increased 
responsiveness to TKIs why these mutations are strong, positive predictors of response to this kind of 
therapy. Studies have shown that mutations in certain exons of the EGFR gene have been consistently 
correlated with increased efficacy in response to EGFR TKIs.  
Activating EGFR mutations are most frequently identified in Asians, in adenocarcinomas, in women and 
in non-smokers. The most frequently observed mutations are represented by single-point mutations in 
exon 21 and deletions in exon 19. The number of patients with activating mutations is relatively limited 
in  Europe:  The  reported  prevalence  of  these  activation  mutations  is  about  10-15%  in  Caucasian 
populations compared to 30% in Asian populations. 
Erlotinib  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  stage  IIIB/IV  NSCLC  in  the  maintenance  (in  patients  with 
stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles of 1st line chemotherapy), 2nd and further-line setting. 
In the first-line setting, platinum-based chemotherapy, which achieves objective response rates (ORR) 
in around 30% – 40% of NSCLC patients, may still be the best option for patients with EGFR wild-type 
(WT) tumours. However, molecular studies have indicated that certain mutations in exons 19 and 21 of 
the  EGFR  gene  occur  more  frequently  in  patients  who  respond  well  to  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI) 
therapy. These mutations have become known as activating mutations. It has been observed that 70-
90% of patients with these alterations respond to TKIs in the first-line setting.   
In contrast, the efficacy of various treatments in the maintenance setting or in second-line of therapy 
is substantially lower, resulting in response rates (RRs) in around only 10% of patients.  
Gefitinib  (Iressa)  is  another  EGFR  TKI  currently  approved  in  EU  Countries  for  treatment  of  patients 
with  NSCLC  and  EGFR  activating  mutations  independently  of  the  line  of  therapy.  Median  PFS  values 
reported with gefitinib (Iressa) in first line treatment of NSCLC are around 9.5-9.8 months [Paz Ares et 
al. 2009, IPASS study, Mok et al 2009]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 3. 1.   Clinical Pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program for erlotinib was extensively discussed in the original MAA and no 
new information is available for this extension of indication.  
3. 3. 2. Clinical efficacy 
  The EURTAC study 
The MAH submitted the interim Clinical Study Report ML20650 (EURTAC) Trial  
Methods 
ML20650 (EURTAC) is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label,randomized study of erlotinib (Tarceva) 
treatment  versus  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  non-small-cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  who 
present mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
Randomised patients have been screened and confirmed exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation 
in the EGFR TK domain. Tumour samples were screened for EGFR activating mutations by use 
of  Sanger  sequencing.  Positive  samples  were  confirmed  using  a  PCR-based  lab  developed 
test with a sensitivity to detect 10% of mutant DNA in a background of 90% WT DNA. 
Patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  received  150  mg/day  orally  until  disease  progression,  unacceptable 
toxicity or death occurred. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received either a cisplatin plus docetaxel 
or  a  cisplatin  plus  gemcitabine  regimen.  Patients  who  were  not  candidates  for  cisplatin  treatment 
would receive carboplatin instead. 
The study design is presented in Figure 1.

  History of another neoplasm other than carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, basal cell skin 
carcinoma treated adequately, or prostate carcinoma with a good prognosis (Gleason ≤ 6) 
treated radically. History of another neoplasm treated curatively and without evidence of 
disease in the last 5 years. 
Treatments 
Erlotinib  
Erlotinib was given at a dose of 150 mg/day once daily; the medication was to be taken at the same 
time every morning with 200 mL of water, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. 
Patients received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For all practical effects a 
treatment cycle was defined as 3 weeks of continuous treatment with erlotinib. 
Chemotherapy The following combinations of chemotherapy were allowed to be used per protocol: 
• Cisplatin plus docetaxel: cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) Day 1 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v.on 
day 1, repeat cycle repeated every 3 weeks 
• Cisplatin plus gemcitabine: Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on Days 
1 and 8. Repeat cycles every 3 weeks. In the case of patients not eligible for treatment with cisplatin, 
cisplatin could be replaced by carboplatin. The schedules were the following: 
• Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1 and carboplatin AUC = 6 Day 1, every 21 days. 
• Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC = 5 Day 1, every 
21 days. 
When docetaxel was used, at each cycle prophylactic medication (6 doses of 8 mg of dexamethasone 
i.v.) was administered. 
Tumour assessments 
Tumour response was evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.0 criteria 
Regular and symmetrical tumour assessments were performed by investigators. A blinded review was 
performed by an independent review committee (IRC).  
Objectives 
The  objective  of  the  EURTAC  trial  was  to  compare  per  oral  treatment  with  erlotinib  with  standard 
chemotherapy  regimens  in  the  1st  line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and  activating 
mutations in EGFR.  
The primary objective of this study was to compare investigator-assessed PFS in the two treatment 
arms of the study (conventional chemotherapy vs. erlotinib) in patients with NSCLC in advanced stages 
(stages IIIB and IV) who have not received previous chemotherapy or any other systemic antitumor 
therapy for their disease and whose tumors have activating mutations in the TK domain of the EGFR. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to assess: 
• Investigator-assessed objective response 
• Overall survival (including 1- and 2-year survival rates) 
• Location of progression 
• Safety profile 
• Gene mutation analysis of EGFR in serum 
• Quality of life (lung cancer symptom scale [LCSS]) 
Sample size - Interim Analysis 
In the sample size calculation, conservative median PFS of 10 months was presumed for the erlotinib 
arm vs. 6 months in the chemotherapy arm. Standard statistical tests were used. 
The  planned  sample  size  was  174  patients.  An  interim  analysis  was  pre-specified  after  88  out  of  135 
planned  events  had  occurred.  A  Lan-DeMets  alpha-spending  function  was  used  to  maintain  the 
significance level at 5%. A more conservative stopping boundary was introduced in the IDMC charter. 
The efficacy interim analysis was performed with a cut-off date of 2 August 2011.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results 
Disposition of patients 
This study was conducted in Spain, Italy and France. The first patient was enrolled in 2007. At the time 
of the data-cut off for the interim analysis (2 August 2010) 154 patients had been randomized in the 
study:  77  received  chemotherapy  and  77  received  erlotinib  as  1st  line  treatment.  The  applicant  has 
adequately  accounted  for  the  number  of  patients  who  were  withdrawn  from  the  study.  Of  note,  the 
imbalances  observed  between  the  treatment  arms  in  this  respect  can  be  explained  by  the  longer 
treatment duration in the erlotinib arm (until progression) compared to the chemotherapy arm (for a 
maximum of 4 cycles (12 weeks).  
The applicant has adequately accounted for major protocol violations. The number is limited and is not 
considered to have affected the integrity of the trial.  
 
 
 
Demographics 
The majority of patients enrolled were from Spanish centers. As expected, more females were included 
in  this  trial  (activating  EGFR  mutations  are  seen  more  frequently  in  females).  All  patients  were 
Caucasians  and  the  median  age  was  64  years.  Small  imbalances  were  observed  between  treatment 
arms regarding gender and smoking status. This is not considered critical.  
Randomization  was  stratified  by  ECOG  status  and  mutation  type/location.  These  factors  were  well-
balanced  between  treatment  arms.  Small  imbalances  in  performance  status  were  noted  within  the 
subgroups of different mutation type which is to be expected in subgroups. 
Disease characteristics 
As  expected,  most  patients  presented  with  adenocarcinomas  with  a  small  imbalance 
between the two treatment arms (88% of tumours in the chemotherapy arm vs. 95% in the 
erlotinib arm). The vast majority of patients had stage IV disease (> 90%). 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary endpoint: PFS (INV) 
The  duration  of  median  follow-up  was  10.7  months  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs.  14.3 months  in  the 
erlotinib  arm.  At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  the  data  were  reasonably  mature:  92  events  had 
occurred. Fourty seven (47) (61.8%) patients had an event in the chemotherapy arm vs. 45 (58.4%) 
in the erlotinib arm.  
The  HR  for  PFS  as  assessed  by  investigators  was  0.42  (95%  CI  0.27-0.64,  p<0.0001)  which 
corresponds  to  a  58  %  reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death.  This  is  considered  a  highly 
clinically relevant gain in PFS. The K-M curves make a clear and early separation. The median PFS for 
patients in the chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in an 
absolute gain of 4.5 months in median PFS in erlotinib-treated patients.  
12% of patients in the chemotherapy arm and 37% of patients in the erlotinib arm were event-free 1 
year after randomization. 
 
 
 
 
 
A  number  of  relevant  sensitivity  analyses  showed  consistent  results  with  the  primary  PFS 
analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses 
 
 
 
 
 
Most  patients  with  activating  EGFR  mutations  have  adenocarcinomas.  The  subgroup  of  patients  with 
non-adenocarcinomas was very small (n= 13) and only 1 patient had squamous cell histology.  
IRC-based assessment of PFS 
Not all scans have been reviewed by the IRC. The retrospective nature of the IRC review and logistic 
barriers  are  mentioned  by  the  MAH  as  possible  reasons  for  the  incomplete  review  by  the  IRC.  The 
percentages of scans reviewed in both treatments arms are relatively large during the first 30 weeks of 
treatment (where the number of patients is largest); 50-75% in the chemotherapy arm and 86-90% in 
the erlotinib arm.  
Based on the number of available scans and relevant clinical information 30 patients were considered 
to have had an event by independent review in the chemotherapy arm vs. 31 patients in the erlotinib 
arm (data cut-off of 2 August 2010). The numbers were 47 and 45, respectively, in the analysis based 
on investigators’ assessment. The HR for PFS (IRC) was 0.47 (95% CI:  0.28 - 0.78, p = 0.0030). The 
median  PFS  was  5.4  months  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs.  10.4  months  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  Even 
though this analysis is based on fewer events than the investigator-based analysis (64% of events in 
the chemotherapy arm and 69% of events in the erlotinib arm), this IRC-based result is consistent with 
the result of the primary analysis.  
When  focusing  on  patients  with  valid  assessments  by  both  investigator  and  IRC  (46  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy  arm  and  61  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm),  the  concordance  rate  was  63%  in  the 
chemotherapy arm and 75.4% in the erlotinib arm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OS 
At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  only  35%  of  the  patients  had  died  reason  why  the  OS 
data are considered still immature. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.47 - 1.37, p-value 
0.42).  The  median  OS  was  18.8  months  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs.  22.9  months  in  the 
erlotinib arm.   
 
 
 
 
 
At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis  more  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  (67%)  had 
received  later  lines  of  therapy  (often  including  an  EGFR,  TKI)  after  progression  vs.  36%  in 
the erlotinib arm which will most certainly confound OS results. 
Best Overall Response (CR/PR) 
The percentage of responders (CR/PR) was significantly larger in the erlotinib arm (54.5%) 
compared  with  the  chemotherapy  arm  (10.5%).  Erlotinib-treated  responders  mainly 
experienced PR (51.9%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In contrast, no significant difference was found between treatment arms in terms of disease control (= 
CR+PR+SD) (65.8% vs. 77.9%) based on investigators’ assessment. This is due to the relatively high 
number of patients who experienced SD in response to chemotherapy.  
QoL 
Completion rates of the QoL questionnaire were too low to allow further analyses.  
Updated Results 
An additional post-hoc analysis was performed including additional data from period of time from cut-
off  for  the  planned  interim  analysis  (August  2,  2010)  until  the  date  of  disclosure  of  interim  analysis 
results  to  study  investigators  (January  26,  2011).  These  data  were  presented  at  ASCO  in  2011,  and 
the Rapporteurs have specifically asked for these data to be presented in this submission. 
The updated PFS analysis was performed when 111 events had occurred (67.8% in the chemotherapy 
arm  and  60.5%  in  the  erlotinib  arm).  The  HR  for  PFS  had  further  improved  (=  0.37  95%  CI:  0.25  – 
0.54,  p<  0.0001).  The  absolute  gain in  median  PFS  was  unchanged  (4.5  months)  in  erlotinib  treated 
patients.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OS results remain immature (40% of patients had died), but it is noteworthy that the HR for OS is no   
longer < 1. In contrast, the percentage of patients in the chemotherapy arm receiving further lines of 
 
 
 
 
therapy  and  particularly  crossing-over  to  receive  erlotinib,  had  risen  to  77%  which  is  a  possible 
explanation for the decreasing OS difference between treatment arms.   
Supportive studies 
An overview of data submitted as part of this application is provided in Table x.  
Efficacy data are available from 438 patients with tumours having activating EGFR mutations, of who 
234 received erlotinib as first-line therapy.  
All  studies  reported,  used  erlotinib  at  the  standard  approved  dose  of  150  mg/day,  which  has  already 
been established as a safe and efficacious dose in patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Of  note,  reliability  of  these  data  presented  as  supportive  couldn’t  be  assessed  by  the  CHMP  as  no 
clinical study report was submitted. 
Table 4.  Studies  Supporting  the  Efficacy  of  Erlotinib  in  First-Line  Treatment  of  NSCLC 
Patients with EGFR Mutations 
  Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) data (Rosell et al., N Engl J Med (2009) 
Methodology 
The SLCG has conducted a prospective, large scale screening for EGFR mutations in patients with stage 
IIIB disease with pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC. Patients were required to be chemotherapy-naïve 
or  to  have  received  up  to  two  prior  chemotherapy  regimensRosell  et  al,  2009,  to  have  measurable 
disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), and an Eastern Cooperative  
Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0-2. Other eligibility criteria included availability of 
sufficient  tumour  tissue  for  EGFR  mutation  analysis,  and  adequate  hematologic,  renal  and  hepatic 
function. The smoking history of the patients was obtained at baseline, and patients were categorized 
as those who had never smoked (<100 lifetime cigarettes), former smokers (≥1 year since cessation), 
or  current  smokers  (still  smoking,  or  <1  year  since  cessation).  Patients  with  active  metachronous 
cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, severe heart disease or who were pregnant were specifically excluded.    
A  total  of  2105  patients  from  129  institutions  in  Spain  were  screened  by  a  central  laboratory  for 
presence of EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R substitution in exon 21) by polymerase chain 
reaction  (PCR)  and  DNA  sequencing  Rosell,  2009  EGFR  mutations  were  found  in  350  /  2105  patients 
(16.6%) of which 217 received treatment with erlotinib. As expected, mutations were most frequent in 
women (69.7%), in never smokers (66.6%) and in patients with adenocarcinomas (80.9%).  
The principal analyses were PFS and OS. In addition, post-hoc analyses included analyses of patients’ 
characteristics and response according to sex, smoking history, age, ECOG PS, and treatment. 
Included  in  the  SLCG  study  were  the  data  from  TARGET,  a  prospective  phase II  trial  of  first-line 
erlotinib treatment in 43 chemo-naïve patients aged 18 years or older with histologically-documented 
diagnosis  of  advanced  NSCLC  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutationsPaz-Ares,  2006.  Patients 
had to have a WHO PS 0-2, normal organ function and no clinically relevant co-morbidities to be 
eligible for the trial. Eligible patients were allocated to receive erlotinib (150 mg/day) orally until PD or 
intolerable  toxicity.  Study  assessments  were  performed  every  3-4  weeks.  The  primary  parameter  of 
efficacy was TTP. Secondary parameters included RR, OS, QoL and toxicity profile.

Results 
Only 296 patients were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment at a dose of 150 mg/day until PD or 
intolerable toxicity. Further 79 patients did never receive treatment for a variety of reasons including 
death (n = 18), patient or physician decision (n = 23), or received erlotinib treatment subsequent to 
the analysis (n = 38). Therefore, a total of 217 patients received treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) 
and  were  included  in  the  analysis.  In  these  remaining  patients,  median  age  was  67  (22-88)  years. 
72.8%  of  subjects  were  female,  98.2%  were  Caucasian,  68.2%  were  never  smokers  and  76.5%  had 
an ECOG PS of 1 or 2. Regarding tumour type, 81.1% of tumours were adenocarcinoma.  
Of  these  patients,  113  (52.1%)  received  erlotinib  as  first-line  therapy,  and  104  received  erlotinib  as 
second-  or  third-line  therapy.  Median  follow-up  for  all  patients  was  14.0  months  (range  1  to  42 
months). 
Median  PFS  in  the  overall  population  (N  =  217)  was  14.0  months  (95%  CI,  11.2  to  16.7)  and  was 
comparable in patients receiving first-line therapy (14.0 months, 95% CI, 9.7 to 18.3; N = 113) and 
second- or further line therapy (13.0 months; 95% CI, 9.7 to 16.3; N =104). 
Of the 197 patients who could be evaluated for response, 24 had a complete response (CR), 115 had a 
partial response (PR), 38 had SD and 20 had PD. The overall rate of CR or PR to erlotinib was 70.6%.  
At  the  time  of  the  analysis,  median  OS  in  the  overall  population  was  27.0  months  (95%  CI,  22.7  to 
31.3 months). Similar results were found in patients who received erlotinib as first-line therapy (28.0 
months: 95% CI, 22.7 to 33.0 months) or as second-line therapy (27.0 months: 95% CI, 19.9 to 34.1 
months). 
There were no significant differences in PFS according to performance status, age, smoking history, or 
type  of  EGFR  mutation  (Table  2).  However,  median  PFS  was  shown  to  be  longer  in  females  (16.0 
months: 95% CI, 12.7 to 19.2 months) than in males (9.0 months: [95% CI, 6.1 to 11.9 months]; p = 
0.003).  Similarly,  median  OS  was  29.0  months  (95%  CI:  24.9  to  33.1)  in  females  and  18.0  months 
(95%  CI:  14.5  to  21.5)  in  males  (p  =  0.05)  in  these  patients  with  activating  EGFR  mutations.  The 
multivariate analysis revealed an association between poor PFS and male sex and the presence of the 
exon 21 (L858R) mutation.  
  Pooled Analysis of Published Clinical Trial Data (Paz-Ares et al., J. Cell. Moll. Med. Vol 
14, N01-2, 2010 pp. 51-69 ) 
Methodology:  
In this literature review, the medical literature (Medline, Biosis Previews and Embase) was reviewed to 
identify  appropriate  clinical  studies  for  inclusion  in  the  pooled  analysis.  The  search  was  limited  to 
studies published in 2004 or later and non-English language manuscripts and reviews were excluded. 
In  addition, studies  presented  at  the  American Society  of Clinical  Oncology  (ASCO)  meetings  in  2008 
and  2009  were  reviewed  as  well.  Studies  that  were  performed  in  the  maintenance  or  adjuvant 
treatment settings or involved sequential administration of multiple EGFR TKIs were excluded from the 
pooled analysis.  
Within the studies included in the pooled analysis, a variety of techniques were used to determine the 
EGFR mutation status of tumours. However, the methods used in individual studies were not critically 
assessed as part of the pooled analysis. 
PFS (or time to progression [TTP]) was chosen as the most appropriate endpoint to evaluate between 
studies  and  the  main  focus  of  the  analysis  was  to  obtain  an  estimate  of  the  pooled  median  PFS  by  a 
weighted  average  of  the  single  study  medians.  Median  PFS  estimates  obtained  in  each  eligible  study 
were summed and the pooled median PFS estimated as the group-size weighted average.   
Since many reports did not provide information on line of therapy specifically for patients with tumours 
having EGFR mutations, the outcome has not been assessed according to line of therapy in the pooled 
analysis. However, in order to estimate the effect of treatment in the first-line setting, an analysis was 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performed that included only studies where 90% or more of the included patients (regardless of EGFR 
mutation status) received the treatment in question as first-line therapy (in consequence, the Spanish 
SLCG study was not included in this subgroup analysis.) 
Results:  
A  total  of  12  studies  involving  365  patients  evaluated  erlotinib,  39  studies  involving  1069  patients 
evaluated  gefitinib  and  9  studies  involving  375  patients  evaluated  chemotherapy.  Among  the  studies 
included in the pooled analysis, the estimated proportion of patients who received first-line treatment 
with erlotinib, gefitinib and chemotherapy was 57%, 57% and 95%, respectively.  
For patients treated with any line of therapy, median PFS was 13.2 months (range 8.6 to 15.8 months) 
in patients treated with erlotinib compared to 9.8 months (range 3 to 16 months) in patients treated 
with gefitinib and 5.9 months (range 4 to 8.4 months) in patients treated with chemotherapy.  
In  the  weighted  pooled  analysis,  the  overall  median  PFS  was  determined  as  13.2  months  (95% 
Accuracy Interval [AI], 12.0 to 14.7 months) for erlotinib treated patients, 9.8 months (95% AI, 9.2 to 
10.4  months)  for  gefitinib  treated  patients  and  5.9  months  (95%  AI,  5.3  to  6.5  months)  for  patients 
treated with chemotherapy.  
 For patients treated predominantly in the first-line setting, median PFS was 12.5 months (range 10.0 
– 16.0 months) in patients treated with erlotinib compared to 9.9 months (range 9.0 – 10.9 months) in 
patients  treated  with  gefitinib  and  6.0  months  (range  4.5  –  6.7  months)  in  patients  treated  with 
chemotherapy. 
  CALGB30406 Phase II study (Janne et al., J Clin Oncol 28:7s, 2010)   
Methodology  
The  CALGB30406  study  was  a  randomized  Phase  II  trial  designed  compared  to  the  first-line  therapy 
with  erlotinib  alone  in  combination  with  carboplatin/paclitaxel  in  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  with 
advanced NSCLC, never or light smokers.  
Patients  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  smoking  history  (never  or  light  smokers)  and  randomized  to 
erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  or  6 cycles  of  carboplatin  (AUC  =  6)  /  paclitaxel  (200  mg/m2)  plus  erlotinib 
(150 mg/day) followed by single agent erlotinib. Collection of pre-tumour assessments was mandatory 
for  determination  of  EGFR  mutation  status.  The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS.  Secondary  endpoints 
included RR and OS.  
Results 
The results of the CALGB30406 study were reported at ASCO in 2010. Of the 182 patients randomized, 
105 were identified to have tumours with wild-type EGFR and 67 were identified to have tumours with 
activating  EGFR  mutations  (32  who  received  erlotinib  alone  and  35  who  received  chemotherapy  plus 
erlotinib).  
Female  patients  comprised  61%  and  58%  of  the  studied  population,  respectively,  and  the  majority 
were  Caucasian  (76%  and  84%  in  the  erlotinib-carboplatin  and  erlotinib  alone  arms,  respectively). 
Most  patients  (>75%  in  both  arms)  were  never  smokers  and  the  majority  had  adenocarcinoma 
subtype (87% in the erlotinib-carboplatin arm vs 80% in the erlotinib alone arm). 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Overall,  PFS  was  similar  between  the  erlotinib  (6.7  months;  [80%  CI,  4.7  to  8.2  months])  and 
chemotherapy  plus  erlotinib  (6.0  months;  [80%  CI,  5.6-7.3  months])  treatment  arms,  respectively. 
However, in patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations, PFS was increased in both erlotinib 
treatments  arms  (16.4  months;  [80%  CI,  12.1  to  23.8]  and  17.2  months  [80%  CI,  11.1  to  27.6]  in 
the erlotinib alone and chemotherapy plus erlotinib arms, respectively). 
Consistent  with  results  for  PFS,  in  patients  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutations,  OS  was 
increased  in  both  erlotinib  treatment  groups.  In  patients  who  received  erlotinib  single  agent  therapy, 
OS  was  27.6  months  [80%  CI;  24.0  to  42.8  months].  Similarly,  OS  in  patients  who  received 
combination therapy was 39.0 months [80% CI: 39.0 - not reached]. 
In patients with tumours with EGFR mutations who received erlotinib alone, RR was 66%. In patients 
treated with erlotinib plus chemotherapy, RR was 69%. 
 
Phase II study (Laskin et al. 2009) 
Methodology  
This  Phase  II  clinical  trial  of  first-line  erlotinib  for  clinically  selected  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC 
showed  the  feasibility  of  performing  pre-treatment  biopsies  in  this  clinical  setting.  The  patient 
population enrolled was ‘enriched’ in that patients were selected for at least two of the following: never 
smokers,  female  gender,  Asian/Southeast  Asian  origin,  and  BAC  or  adenocarcinoma.  A  total  of  65 
patients  with  advanced  (Stage  IIIB/IV)  NSCLC,  no  prior  chemotherapy  for  advanced  disease  and  an 
ECOG PS  2 were selected to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day until PD. The primary endpoint of the trial 
was non-progression at 8 weeks. 
Results  
More than 80% of patients were female, 75% were never smokers, 70% were of Asian origin and 69% 
had  adenocarcinoma  subtype.  Results  of  a  mutational  analysis  showed  that  of  the  49  samples  with 
adequate  DNA  for  analysis,  19  (39%)  had  EGFR  mutations  (exons  19  and  21).  Seventeen  of  these 
patients were of Asian ethnicity and 18 were never smokers.  
Clinical results showed that 52 of the patients treated with erlotinib (80%) had not progressed after 8 
weeks.  Female  patients,  patients  who  were  never  smokers,  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  histology 
and  patients  of  Asian  ethnicity  were  more  likely  to  derive  benefit  from  erlotinib  treatment.  PR  was 
observed in 22 patients (34%) and SD in 24 patients (37%) with a disease control rate of 71%. Of the 
22 patients with a PR, 17 had tumours with activating EGFR mutations. Two of the 24 patients with SD 
had  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutations.  TTP  in  patients  with  tumours with  EGFR  mutations  was 
12.8 months and median OS was 17.0 months in patients with tumours with EGFR mutations. 
 
Study BO18192 (SATURN)  
Methodology 
This  is  a  multi-centre,  double-blind  randomized  Phase  III  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
erlotinib  or  placebo  following  4  cycles  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  histologically 
documented, advanced or  recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) 
or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC who have not experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity 
during chemotherapy.  
After  eligibility  screening,  patients  with  Stage  IIIB  or  IV  NSCLC  completed  4  cycles  of  an  acceptable 
platinum-based  chemotherapy  combination.  Following  chemotherapy,  patients  who  met  the  following 
criteria; ECOG PS of 0 – 1, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, adequate haematological, renal and 
 
 
 
 
 
hepatic  function,  and  absence  of  unacceptable  toxicity  and/or  disease  progression  (CR,  PR  or  SD), 
were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment. 
Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  erlotinib  150  mg/day  or  placebo  until  PD, 
unacceptable toxicity or death. Randomization was performed using an adaptive minimization method 
which  ensured  a  balanced  stratification  by  treatment  arm  for  the  following  factors:  EGFR  protein 
expression  by  IHC,  stage  of  disease  at  start  of  chemotherapy,  ECOG  PS,  chemotherapy  regimen, 
smoking status and region. Treatment was to continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity or death. 
Mandatory  tumour  sampling  was  performed  at  screening.  Tumour  measurements  (RECIST)  were 
conducted at screening, baseline, every 6 weeks until week 48 and then every 12 weeks until PD. QoL 
was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) instrument. 
The  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  investigator-assessed  PFS  according  to  RECIST in  all  patients 
and in the EGFR IHC positive population. An independent combined radiological and clinical assessment 
was  undertaken  to  provide  an  independent  assessment  of  response  and  PD.  Secondary  efficacy 
endpoints  included  OS in all  patients, OS in  EGFR IHC  positive population,  PFS  in  EGFR  IHC  negative 
subgroup,  OS  in  EGFR  IHC  negative  subgroup,  TTP,  time  to  symptom  progression,  response  rates 
(RECIST) and QoL. Exploratory analyses of other molecular markers and their correlations with clinical 
outcomes were conducted. 
With the exception of EGFR status assessment by IHC, other biomarkers were investigated to generate 
hypotheses  regarding  their  potential  value  as  predictive  indicators  of  clinical  benefit  from  erlotinib 
therapy  in  NSCLC.  Those  biomarkers  included  EGFR  gene  copy  number  by  fluorescence  in  situ 
hybridization  (FISH),  EGFR  mutation  status,  Kirsten  Rat  Sarcoma  2  viral  oncogene  homolog  (K-ras) 
mutation  status,  and  the  status  of  a  polymorphism  in  EGFR  Intron  1.  Subgroup  analyses  of  these 
biomarkers were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan. 
Results   
Patients  were  randomized  to  treatment  with  erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  (n  =  438)  or  placebo  (n  =  451) 
until PD or intolerable toxicity.  
In patients with a known EGFR mutation status (n = 449), 11% were identified with mutation positive 
tumours, 22 in the erlotinib group and 27 in the placebo group.  
Data  presented  for  study  BO18192  are  from  the  clinical  cut-off  for  overall  survival  (May  17,  2009) 
since this is the most recent data. 
In  patients  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutations,  addition  of  erlotinib  after  4 cycles  of 
chemotherapy  significantly  improved  PFS  compared  with  placebo  (HR  0.23,  [95%  CI,  0.12  to  0.45]; 
log-rank  p  <  0.0001).  Median  PFS  was  46.1  weeks,  [95%  CI,  33.7  to  59.6]  in  the  erlotinib  arm 
compared with 13.0 weeks the placebo arm [95% CI, 11.6 to 21.3].  The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is 
presented in figure 9.

  Study ML20981 (OPTIMAL) 
OPTIMAL  study  is  an  ongoing  randomized,  multicenter  Phase III  investigator  sponsored  trial  (IST) 
conducted  in  China  comparing  efficacy  and  safety  of  first-line  erlotinib  versus  carboplatin  plus 
gemcitabine chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations. This study 
was  a  trial  sponsored  and  run  by  the  Chinese  Thoracic  Oncology  Group  (CTONG).  Since  no  CSR  is 
available  for  this  study,  the  MAH  submitted  the  overview  of  the  efficacy  results  as  part  of  the 
responses to the 1st RfSI and as they have been presented at international congresses: 
Of 549 patients screened, 186 (34%) had EGFR activating mutation NSCLC, 165 were randomized and 
154  included  in  the  study  population  (82  erlotinib;  72  carboplatin/gemcitabine  [carb/gem]).  Baseline 
data were well-balanced between the erlotinib and carb/gem arms: male (42% vs. 40%, respectively), 
adenocarcinoma (88% vs. 86%), never-smoker (72% vs. 69%) and type of EGFR activating mutation 
(exon 19 deletion: 52% vs. 54%). The median PFS was 13.1 months in the erlotinib group compared 
with 4.6 months in the carb/gem group;  PFS HR = 0.16 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.26]; p <0.0001 (Figure 
10).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Overall, the studies enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC (stage III/IV), median age ranged between 
22 and 88 years and more than 80% of patients in the studies had an ECOG PS <2. Adenocarcinoma 
was  the  most  common  tumour  subtype  and  the  majority  of  patients  in  each  of  these  studies  were 
females who had never been smokers.  
An  overview  of  efficacy  results  for  the  erlotinib  studies  in  NSCLC  patients  with  tumours  having 
activating EGFR mutations is shown in Table 5.

because  the  treatment  in  this  study  was  given  as  maintenance  therapy  after  end  of  chemotherapy  in  a  subset  of 
responding patients and the time to event was measured only from end of standard first line therapy. 
Due  to  the  marked  differences  in  study  design  and  variety  of  data  sources,  no  pooling  of  the  study 
data has been performed.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  has  submitted  the  CSR  of  the  interim  results  from  study  ML  20650  (EURTAC),  a 
randomised  Phase  III,  open-label  trial  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  erlotinib 
treatment  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  who  present  mutations  in  the 
tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR.  
The  EURTAC  study  is  the  first  prospectively  conducted,  relatively  large  randomized,  unblinded  phase 
III trial comparing the efficacy of erlotinib to a standard platinum-based doublet regimen in the 1st line 
treatment  of  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  in  Europe.  Erlotinib  was  dosed  at  150  mg/day 
which is the dose already approved for 2nd line and maintenance treatment. Standard doses were used 
in  the  chemotherapy  regimens.  The  control  arm  is  acceptable:  4-6  cycles  of  platinum-based  doublets 
represent  the  standard  regimen  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC.  The  choice  of  the 
specific  chemotherapy  regimen  was  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician  (4  options  were  pre-
specified).  In  case  of  AEs,  recommendations  for  dose  reductions/interruptions  had  been  pre-specified 
for both erlotinib and chemotherapy regimens.  
Following  review  of  the  interim  analysis  results,  the  IDMC  recommended  stopping  of  the  trial  after 
demonstration of a substantial benefit of erlotinib over chemotherapy. At the time the HR for PFS was 
0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.64, p<0.0001) which corresponds to a 58 % reduction in the risk of progression 
or  death.  The  K-M  curves  make  a  clear  and  early  separation.  The  median  PFS  for  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in an absolute gain of 
4.5  months  in  median  PFS  in  erlotinib-treated  patients.  This  is  lower  than  what  was  observed  for 
erlotinib as first-line treatment in the study by Rosell et al. (14 months (95% CI: 11.2 – 16.7)) and in 
the meta-analysis by Paz-Ares et al. (12.5 months). A relatively higher degree of patients with tumour 
stage IV (>91%) and other prognostic factors of poor outcome (males, previous smokers, pre-treated 
patients, mutation type, poor PS) might explain the poorer result in the present study. This being an 
interim  analysis  may  also  be  a  possible  cause.  Nevertheless,  this  is  still  considered  a  highly  clinically 
relevant  gain  in  PFS.  The  robustness  of  the  result  was  confirmed  in  a  number  of  sensitivity  analysis 
and consistent results were found in subgroups with an acceptable sample size.  
The trial was unblinded due to the different nature and schedules of the treatment arms: The control 
arm was represented by 4 cycles of standard platinum-based doublets vs. the test arm of continuous 
dosing  of  erlotinib  until  progression,  death  or  unacceptable  toxicity  whichever  occurred  first.  The 
primary endpoint was PFS which is acceptable in the 1st line setting. Secondary endpoints were ORR, 
OS,  safety,  QoL  (LCSS  scale),  location  of  progression  and  gene  mutation  analyses  of  EGFR. 
Furthermore,  IRC-based  assessments  of  PFS  and  ORR  were  introduced  in  order  to  rule  out 
investigator-related bias which is endorsed. 
Due  to  the  unblinded  nature  of  the  trial  an  independent  blinded  review  was  introduced  by  an  IRC. 
Concordance  rates  observed  between  investigators’  review  and  the  IRC  were  63-73%.  More  scans 
were  reviewed  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  there  is  some  uncertainty  left  as  to  the  reason  for  this 
 
 
 
 
 
discrepancy. However, overall the percentages of scans reviewed in both treatment arms are relatively 
large.  Therefore, the risk of a large systemic bias in the investigators’ assessments can be ruled out. 
The  HR  for  PFS  (IRC-based)  was  0.47  (95%  CI:    0.28  -  0.78,  p  =  0.0030)  and  the  median  PFS  5.4 
months  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs.  10.4  months  in  the  erlotinib  arm,  thus  confirming  the  result  of 
the INV-based analysis. 
A  significant increase  in  patients  experiencing  a  PR/CR  (mainly  PR)  was  seen in  patients  treated  with 
erlotinib  (54.5%)  compared  to  chemotherapy  (10.5%).  The  observed  RR  in  the  erlotinib  arm  was 
generally lower than previously observed (70% in the Rosell study). The same explanations as offered 
for  PFS  may  apply  here.  Furthermore,  patients  with  “evaluable”  disease  and  not  only  “measurable” 
disease were allowed in the study (8 in the erlotinib arm). These patients can’t obtain documentation 
of PR by RECIST.    
OS  results  were  immature.  So  far  no  difference  in  OS  was  observed  between  treatment  arms  but  a 
high degree of cross-over and later lines of therapies are expected to have confounded the OS results. 
Mature OS data must be submitted as a FUM.  
QoL data are inconclusive due to low completion rates. 
An updated analysis was performed when 111 PFS events had occurred (67.8% in the chemotherapy 
arm and 60.5% in the erlotinib arm). The HR for PFS had further improved (= 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25 – 
0.54,  p<  0.0001).  The  absolute  gain in  median  PFS  was  unchanged  (4.5  months)  in  erlotinib  treated 
patients.  OS  results  remain  immature  (40%  had  died),  but  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  HR  for  OS  is  no   
longer < 1. In contrast, the percentage of patients in the chemotherapy arm receiving further lines of 
therapy  and  particularly  crossing-over  to  receive  erlotinib  had  risen  to  77%  which  is  a  possible 
explanation for the decreasing OS difference between treatment arms.   
Overall, the updated results confirmed the results of the original interim analysis.  
The MAH submitted in the original application data derived from published subgroup analyses of three 
phase II-III studies. These studies involved a very limited number of NSCLC patients with known EGFR 
activating  mutations.  The  pooled  analysis  of  recent  trials  performed  in  patients  with  EGFR  activating 
mutation tumours treated with first-line chemotherapy or with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) was 
hampered by the same flaw. No study reports were submitted allowing an assessment of the reliability 
and quality of the data.  
From  a  clinical  perspective  the  data  presented  on  erlotinib  were  considered  of  clinical  relevance.       
The  results  consistently  show  median  PFS  advantages  with  erlotinib  in  first  line  treatment  of  NSCLC 
patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  ranging  from  12.5  up  to  16.4  months.  Such  results  are  of 
clinical  relevance  in  this  patient  population.  Such  patients  historically  are  known  to  progress  after  a 
median of 6 months when treated with currently recommended 1st line platinum-based chemotherapy 
and,  otherwise,  after  a  median  of  10  months  when  treated  with  gefitinib  (IPASS  study).  The  survival 
results  of  the  SLCG  study,  and  of  the  CALGB30406  study,  showing  a  median  OS  with  erlotinib  of  28 
and 27 months respectively, would confirm the benefits of erlotinib in the target population.   
The  results  indicate  that  patients  with  NSCLC  and  activating  EGFR  mutations  represent  a  distinct 
subgroup of patients and that these activating mutations in the EGFR are a strong predictive marker of 
response  to  TKIs.  Furthermore,  there’s  a  molecular rationale  behind  this  marked  response  which  has 
been reproducible in several trials.   
However,  from  a  regulatory  perspective,  the  lack  of  CSRs  from  prospectively  conducted  trials  in  the 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and  EGFR  mutation  positive  tumours  was  
considered  a  major  deficiency  in  the  original  application.  The  databases  were  not  designed  for 
regulatory  purposes  and  the  data  quality  and  GCP  compliance  could  not  be  evaluated.  The  main 
endpoints PFS and RR in these open-label multicenter studies are much more prone to bias than e.g. 
 
 
OS.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  assessment  of  PFS  and  the  risk  of  bias,  the  CHMP  has  issued  the 
Appendix  1  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man  on 
methodological  aspects  of  PFS.  If  and  to  what  extent  these  considerations  were  followed  cannot  be 
evaluated without full CSRs.  
Finally,  availability  of  other  licensed  EGFR  TKI  such  as  gefitinib  for  treatment  of  NSCLC  limits  the 
medical  need  for  this  class  of  drugs  in  this  subgroup  of  the  NSCLC  population.  Indeed,  although  in 
several in vitro studies certain EGFR mutations appear to be more sensitive to erlotinib than gefitinib, 
confirming  prospective  clinical  data  comparing  activity  of  gefitinib  versus  erlotinib  and  showing 
superiority  of  erlotinib  is  missing.  Moreover,  recent  published  phase  II  studies  and  case  reports 
evaluating  the  potential  clinical  activity  of  erlotinib  in  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  who 
experienced  PD  with  gefitinib,  failed  to  show  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  erlotinib  at  least  for  the 
majority of the patients treated, probably due to potential acquired cross-over resistance.   
In  the  publication  of  Rosell  et  al,  it  is  noteworthy  that  20%  of  erlotinib-treated  patients  seem  to  be 
long-term  survivors  (alive  at  36  months).  Overall,  within  the  very  responsive  subset  of  patients  with 
activating EGFR mutations, it appears that both clinical characteristics (ECOG performance status <1, 
female  gender,  adenocarcinoma,  absence  of  brain  metastases)  as  well  as  molecular  characteristics 
(exon 19 deletions) are associated with a better prognosis (long-term survival).  
However, the lack of CSR in the Spanish Lung cancer Group study, was considered a major deficiency 
from  a  regulatory  perspective.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to  provide  more  reassurance  regarding 
the data quality and reliability of the SLCG study. The MAH provided additional information about the 
SLCG  study  including  a  protocol  outline,  list  of  sites  and  investigators,  CRF,  ICF  and  supplementary 
tables  to  the  NEJM  publication.  The  choice  of  treatment  was  made  at  each  respective  institution 
according  to  local  recommendations.  Inclusion  criteria  were  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  (non-
squamous). Patients could previously have been treated with chemotherapy so there was no limitation 
to 1st line treatment in the advanced setting. Patients to whom erlotinib was administered as a 1st line 
therapy  were  part  of  the  TARGET  clinical  substudy.    For  this  subgroup  of  patients,  erlotinib  was 
apparently used in accordance with the Spanish Ministry of Health recommendations on the utilization 
of drugs for compassionate use. However, no CSR was available for the SLCG study and neither for the 
TARGET study. 
In the analysis of the data provided in the meta-analysis by Paz-Ares et al, and although there appear 
to  be  some  gaps  in  the  funnel  plots,  (which  could  be  a  chance  finding  due  to  the  small  number  of 
studies or could be indicative of publication bias) the larger studies lie closer to the vertical reference 
lines (pooled median PFS) in the plots than the smaller studies and these references are in support of 
an  increasing  trend  in  median  PFS  with  chemotherapy-gefitinib-erlotinib.  Therefore,  even  in  presence 
of  a  publication  bias,  it  appears  unlikely  that  it  would  affect  the  conclusion  of  increasing  median  PFS 
with erlotinib compared to chemotherapy or gefitinib. This is also supported by the forest plots. Due to 
the  lack  of  CSRs  from  individual  studies,  this  publication  could  only  be  considered  supportive  to  the 
findings of the EURTAC trial. 
The  SATURN  study  formed  the  basis  of  the  approval  of  erlotinib  as  maintenance  therapy  in  patients 
with  SD  after  4  cycles  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  Although,  the  benefit  was  much  larger  in 
patients with activating EGFR mutations, this subgroup was limited and the Risk/Benefit -balance was 
also considered to be positive in patients with EGFR WT tumours why the indication was not restricted 
to patients with EGFR activating mutations.  
The  results  of  the  OPTIMAL  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  superiority  for  erlotinib  versus 
chemotherapy  in  terms  of  PFS  in  the  Asian  population.  The  quality  of  these  data  cannot  be  assessed 
and the MAH has informed the CHMP that no CSR could be made available. In absence of a CSR, the 
study results cannot be discussed. 
 
 
In  summary,  the  interim  results  from  the  EURTAC  study  were  considered  pivotesl  whereas  published 
results without CSRs were only considered supportive in this application. 
Methodology for EGFR mutation testing 
Only  limited  information  is  available  regarding  the  methodologies  used  to  assess  the  EGFR  mutation 
status  in  the  publications  included  in  this  submission.  In  particular,  the  CALGB30406  study  abstract 
does  not  provide  any  information,  and  in  the  pooled  analysis  publication  by  Paz-Ares  et  al.  the  only 
comments  regarding  EGFR  mutation  testing  state  that  a  variety  of  techniques  were  used  and  these 
were not critically assessed as part of the analysis. The report by Laskin specifies that the EGFR gene 
status was assessed by DNA sequencing, but no details on how this was performed are provided. On 
the contrary the publication by Rosell et al. provides a detailed description of the analysis (a laboratory 
developed  method  (PB  SOP)  that  was  used.  It  was  based  on length  analysis  of  the  fluorescently 
labelled PCR product for exon 19 deletions, and a TaqMan assay for the L858R mutations in exon 21. 
All  positive  samples  were  confirmed  by  DNA  sequencing.  Prior  to  DNA  extraction,  samples  were 
enriched for tumour content by laser-capture micro-dissection. The same methodology is being used in 
the ongoing EURTAC study.  
Finally, in the SATURN study, EGFR mutation analyses were performed using DNA lysates from macro- 
or  micro-dissected  tissue  samples  with  a  minimum  tumour  cell  content  of  60  -  80%.  Exons  1821  of 
the EGFR gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multiple independent products 
were  analysed  by  Sanger  sequencing.  Mutations  had  to  be  confirmed  on  both  strands  of  at  least  two 
PCR  products.  Samples  were  classified  EGFR  MUT+  if  the  most  commonly  observed  activating 
mutations, i.e. deletions in exon 19, and/or the L858R point mutation in exon 21 were detected. 
Although  tumours  with  EGFR  activation  mutations  can  often  be  found  in  NSCLC  patients  with  certain 
characteristics,  patients  can  not  be  selected  for  1st  line  TKI  therapy  based  on  clinical  characteristics 
only  as  no  characteristics  have  been  identified  that  are  sufficient  or  necessary  for  such  mutations  to 
occur. Therefore, patient selection must be based on mutational status why the quality and sensitivity 
of  the  used  EGFR  mutation  assays  becomes  essential.  Earlier,  direct  sequencing  was  commonly  used 
for  the  detection  of  EGFR  mutations.  However,  as  this  method  only  allows  detection  of  mutant 
sequences  constituting  more  than  30%  of  the  total  genetic  content,  various  alternative  detection 
methods  have  been  taken  into  use  that  allow  detection  in  samples  containing  few  tumour  cells,  e.g. 
pleural fluid (these include micro-dissection followed by PCR-mediated amplification etc.).  
The  MAH  has  adequately  discussed  the  EGFR  mutation  testing  techniques  currently  in  use,  the  only 
commercially  available  kit  (TheraScreen  EGFR  29  by  DxS  Ltd)  and  the  tests  used  in  the  studies 
included in this dossier and in ongoing studies. More sensitive tests are under development, and EGFR 
mutation assays will improve further in the years to come, but overall, it is reassuring that mutational 
status  has  been  determined  according  to  accepted  methodologies  by  experienced  staff  at  central 
laboratories.  
In  addition,  the  MAH  has  compared  the  3  methodologies  in  question  (sequencing,  PB  SOP  and  DxS) 
and  documented  that  1)  concordance  between  sequencing  and  PB  SOP  was  100%  when  sequencing 
samples were enriched for tumour content and 2)  100% concordance was observed between PB SOP 
and DxS.  
The  MAH  has  proposed  to  include  the  following  text  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  which  is  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Assessment  of  EGFR  mutation  status:  When  assessing  the  EGFR  mutation  status  of  a  patient,  it  is 
important  that  a  well-validated  and  robust  methodology  is  chosen  to  avoid  false  negative  or  false 
positive determinations”.  
3.3.2.   Clinical safety 
  Evaluation of Safety Parameters 
The  safety  analysis  of  study  ML20650  (EURTAC)  is  based  on  the  safety  analysis  population  (SAP). 
Adverse events were collected up until 28 days after the final administration of study medication but it 
is important to note that, due to the nature of the treatments the duration of therapy differed in the 2 
arms.  Chemotherapy  was  administered  to  patients  for  a  maximum  of  4  cycles  (approximately  3 
months) whereas erlotinib was administered until PD or unacceptable toxicity (with the median time to 
PFS being 9.4 months). This may result in a higher incidence of adverse events in the erlotinib arm. 
 In the TARGET study adverse events (AEs) were reported every 3-4 weeks from baseline until PD or 
death. AEs (excluding death) that appeared up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or 30 days 
after patient withdrawal (whichever was later) were evaluated. Preferred terms were assigned by the 
sponsor to the original terms entered on the CRF, using MedDRA v8.1.   
In  study  BO18192,  following  completion  of  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy,  AEs  were  recorded  at  the 
baseline visit and then throughout the erlotinib treatment period until PD or withdrawal of the patient. 
All AEs (related and unrelated) occurring within 28 days of last study medication intake were recorded. 
Preferred  terms  were  assigned  by  the  sponsor  to  the  original  terms  entered  on  the  CRF,  using 
MedDRA v11.0. 
In the ongoing trial ML20981, AEs were recorded every 3 weeks throughout the trial until PD or death. 
All deaths occurring during the trial period or within 30 days after completion of the trial are reported. 
Preferred terms were assigned by the sponsor to the original terms entered on the CRF, using MedDRA 
v10.   
  Safety Populations 
In  the  EURTAC  study  5  of  the  154  randomized  patients  were  excluded  from  the  safety  analysis 
populations  (SAP);  3  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  had  no  treatment  and  2  patients  in  the 
erlotinib arm (one patient had no treatment and one patient had no safety follow-up). 
The safety analysis populations for the TARGET and BO18192 studies comprised all patients who had 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  had  at  least  one  safety  follow-up,  whether 
withdrawn  prematurely  or  not.  Of  the  43  patients  enrolled  in  the  TARGET  study,  42  were  included  in 
the safety analysis population.  
Of the 49 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours in study BO18192, 48 patients (26 placebo, 22 
erlotinib)  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  One  patient  was  excluded  from  the  safety 
analysis due to unblinding of the study drug as placebo and intake of erlotinib. 
In  study  ML20981,  the  safety  analysis  population  included  all  patients  who  were  randomized  and 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  treatment  drug.  The  safety  analysis  population  comprised  155  patients 
(83 in the erlotinib arm, 72 in the chemotherapy arm). 
 
Patient exposure 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed information over extent of exposure and incidence of dose reductions specifically experienced 
by  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  have been  provided  only  for  EURTAC,  TARGET,  OPTIMAL, 
and SATURN studies.  
In  the  EURTAC  study,  the  median  dose  intensity  of  erlotinib  was  150  mg  (range  78  mg  to  150  mg).  
Overall, 28% of patients had a dose modification (reduction or interruption). The majority of patients 
(80%) had no dose reduction. However, 15/75 (20%) patients had their erlotinib dose reduced to 100 
mg and 4/75 (5%) patients had their erlotinib dose reduced to 50 mg. The majority of patients (87%) 
had no dose interruption but 5/75 (7%) had a dose interruption for < 1 week and 8/75 (11%) patients 
had their dose disrupted for ≥ 1 week. 
Overall,  the  exposure  to  erlotinib  or  to  the  4  possible  chemotherapy  regimens,  respectively,  was 
considered adequate and representative to allow further evaluation of the safety profile. 
In the TARGET study of the 42 patients evaluable for safety, 13 (31%) had a temporary interruption of 
study treatment, 12 patients (28.6%) had an erlotinib dose reduction to 100 mg/day and in 1 of these 
12 patients erlotinib was further reduced to 50 mg/day.  
In the OPTIMAL study dose reductions were reported in 5 patients in the erlotinib arm (6.0%) and 28 
patients in the chemotherapy arm (38.9%).  
In    SATURN  study  of  the  48  evaluable  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  dose  reductions  were 
performed in 4 patients treated with erlotinib (2 due to rash) and in 1 patient receiving placebo.  
  Adverse events, Serious Adverse Events and Deaths per study 
EURTAC study 
 
 
 
 
Common AEs 
Almost all patients in both treatment arms experienced AEs. The safety profiles of erlotinib compared 
to  standard  chemotherapy  regimens  are  quiet  distinct.  The  most  common  and  characteristic  AEs 
associated with erlotinib were diarrhea and rash as expected.   
Severity 
Seven  (7)  subjects  experienced  grade  5  events  in  the  erlotinib  arm  vs.  4  in  the 
chemotherapy arm. The relatively high number in the erlotinib arm can be explained by the 
longer  treatment  duration.  Overall,  more  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  experienced 
severe  events  (grade  ≥  3):  49  patients  (66.2%)  compared  to  31  patients  (41.3%)  in  the 
erlotinib  arm.  Common  severe  events  in  the  chemotherapy  arms  were  neutropenia  and  asthenia. 
Common severe events in the erlotinib arm were infections/infestations. 
 
 
 
 
Deaths 
At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  28/77  (36%)  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs. 
27/77  (35%)  of  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (35%)  had  died,  mainly  due  to  progressive 
disease (PD).  
During  the  active  treatment  phase,  7%  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  and  13%  of  patients  in 
the  erlotinib  arm  died.  Of  note,  the  treatment  duration  was  much  longer  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  In  the 
erlotinib  arm,  3  deaths  were  due  to  PD.  Seven  (7)  deaths  were  due  to  SAEs  but  only  one  of  these 
deaths was considered to be directly related to the treatment (hepatotoxicity). 
SAEs 
25.7% of patients in the chemotherapy arm vs. 26.7% in the erlotinib arm experienced SAEs.  
In  the  erlotinib  arm,  only  5  events  were  considered  to  be  treatment-related  (diarrhea, 
respiratory tract infection, hepatotoxitiy (grade 5), hyperbiliruminaemia, lung disorder).  
Discontinuations 
The percentages of patients discontinuing due to AEs were largely similar between treatment 
arms (14.9% vs. 12%). In the erlotinib arm, 4 of the triggering events were considered to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be  treatment-related  (mucosal  inflammation,  diarrhea,  rash,  lung  disorder).  This  is  in  line 
with previous observations.   
The safety profile analysis did not change in the updated analysis.    
TARGET study 
Common adverse events 
The most commonly reported AEs (with an incidence  10%) reported in patients in the TARGET study 
are  shown  in  Table  6.  The  most  common  individual  events  were  diarrhoea  (28  patients,  66.7%), 
asthenia  (22  patients,  52.4%),  rash  (19  patients,  45.2%),  alopecia  (13  patients,  31.0%),  dyspnoea 
(13 patients, 31.0%) and conjunctivitis (13 patients, 31.0%).

Most  AEs  reported  in  the  TARGET  study  were  mild  or  moderate  (NCI-CTC  Grade  1  or  2)  in  intensity. 
Nineteen patients experienced 49 ≥ Grade 3 AEs. Two patients experienced a Grade  3 rash and three 
experienced   Grade  3  diarrhoea.  Other  Grade  3  events  reported  in  more  than  one  patient included 
asthenia (3 patients), dyspnoea (3 patients), folliculitis (2 patients), pneumonia (2 patients), and back 
pain (2 patients). 
Deaths 
Thirty-one of the 42 patients (73.8%) in the TARGET study safety population had died at the time of 
the  database  cut-off  for  the  safety  analysis  (April  22,  2010).  All  but  three  of  the  patients  died  as  a 
result of PD. Of the three patients who died for reasons other than PD, one died as a result of a urinary 
tract  infection  and  one  as  a  result  of  antiphospholipid  syndrome.  Both  events  were  considered 
unrelated to trial treatment by the investigator. One additional patient died as a result of encephalitis 
which the investigator reported as being possibly related to trial treatment. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Fifteen patients in the subpopulation of patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations from the 
TARGET study experienced at least one SAE during the treatment period. Most SAEs were reported by 
no  more  than  one  patient  each.  The  only  events  reported  by  more  than  1  patient  were  dyspnoea 
(3 patients), infection (2 patients) and pneumonia (2 patients). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three  patients  (7.1%)  experienced  a  SAE  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  trial 
treatment.  One  patient  experienced  serious  encephalitis,  one  patient  experienced  a  serious  infection 
and the third patient experienced 2 serious events which were reported as infection and pneumonia. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation / Interruption / Modification of Treatment 
One patient receiving erlotinib treatment in the TARGET study was withdrawn from trial treatment as a 
result of an adverse event. This patient was withdrawn as a result of a Grade 4 skin toxicity which the 
investigator considered probably related to trial treatment. Note: at the time of the safety analysis for 
the  SLCG  study,  which  included  the  data  from  TARGET,  no  patient  had  withdrawn  as  a  result  of  an 
adverse event. 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
In the TARGET study, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a class were reported in 36 (85.7%) 
patients.  Rash  (preferred  term,  all  grades)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  individual  event, 
occurring in 19 patients (45.2%). The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity and most 
patients  (34/42;  81.0%)  experienced  a  skin  or  subcutaneous  tissue  disorder  which  was  considered 
related to trial treatment by the investigator. Two patients reported a Grade  3 rash. Other frequently 
reported skin and subcutaneous events reported in patients in the TARGET trial included alopecia (13 
patients;  31%),  dry  skin  (9  patients;  21.4%),  pruritus  (8  patients;  19.0%),  skin  toxicity  (7  patients; 
16.7%),  and  erythema  (4  patients;  9.5%).  The  Grade  3  events  acne,  nail  bed  inflammation  and 
onycholysis  were  each  reported  by  one  patient  in  this  organ  system.  None  of  the  skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders in the TARGET study were reported as SAEs. 
SATURN Study (BO18192) 
Common adverse events 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  reported  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  with  EGFR  mutated 
tumours  in  study  BO18192  are  shown  in  Table  7.  A  higher  percentage  of  erlotinib  EGFR  mutation 
positive  patients  experienced  at  least  1  AE  (20  patients,  90.9%  on  erlotinib,  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  (12  patients,  46.2%).  The  most  common  events  in  the  erlotinib  group  were  rash 
(erlotinib  group  10  patients,  45.5%;  placebo  group  1  patient,  3.8%),  diarrhoea  (erlotinib  group  8 
patients, 36.4%; placebo group 3 patients, 11.5%), cough (erlotinib group 5 patients, 22.7%; placebo 
group 1 patient, 3.8%), nausea (erlotinib group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 3 patients, 11.5%), 
dyspnoea (erlotinib group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 1 patients, 3.8%), and headache (erlotinib 
group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 1 patients, 3.8%).

Treatment-related adverse events 
In  the  subpopulation  of  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR mutated  tumours  in  study  BO18192,  19  of  the  22 
patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (86.4%)  compared  with  5  patients  (19.2%)  in  the  placebo  group 
experienced  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment.  In  the  erlotinib 
group, the most common AEs regarded as related were rash (erlotinib 10 patients, 45.5%; placebo 1 
patient,  3.8%)  and  diarrhoea  (erlotinib  6  patients,  27.3%;  placebo  3  patients,  11.5%).  Other  AEs  in 
the  erlotinib group  regarded  as  related  in  at least  10%  of  patients  included  pruritus  (13.6%,  placebo 
7.7%),  acne  (13.6%,  placebo  0%),  dermatitis  acneiform,  (13.6%;  placebo  0%),  dry  skin  (13.6%; 
placebo 0%), skin fissures (13.6%; placebo 0%), and anorexia (13.6%; placebo 0%). 
Severity of adverse events 
In the subpopulation of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours from study BO18192, the majority 
of AEs were mild or moderate (NCI-CTC Grade 1 or 2). No grade 4 or 5 AEs were reported in the EGFR 
mutation  positive  patients.  Six  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  experienced  12  Grade  3  AEs  compared 
with  one  patient  in  the  placebo  group  who  experienced  1  Grade 3  event.  In  the  erlotinib  treatment 
group, only one patient experienced a Grade 3 rash and one experienced Grade 3 diarrhoea, compared 
with none in the placebo group. No individual Grade 3 event was reported in more than one patient.  
Deaths 
In  study  BO18192,  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours,  at  the  time  of  the 
clinical cut-off for the survival analysis, 8 patients in the erlotinib treatment group and 13 patients in 
the  placebo  group  had  died  during  the  treatment  period.  All  21  patients  had  died  as  a  result  of 
progressive disease.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious Adverse Events  
One  patient  in  the  subpopulation  of  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  in  study  BO18192 
experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  during  the  treatment  period.  This  patient,  who  was  receiving 
erlotinib  experienced  left  ventricular  dysfunction.  The  event  was  considered  unrelated  to  trial 
treatment and resolved following corrective treatment.  
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation / Interruption / Modification of Treatment 
None  of  the  patients  in  the  subpopulation  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  in  study  BO18192  were 
withdrawn  from  the  erlotinib/placebo  single  agent  treatment  period  as  a  result  of  an  adverse  event. 
Four  patients  in  the  erlotinib  subgroup  required  dose  adjustment  following  AEs  compared  with  1 
patient in the placebo subgroup. 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
Prior  to  unblinding  of  study  BO18192,  the  sponsor  defined  a  term  “rash”  that  encompassed  all  the 
appropriate  MedDRA  preferred  terms  that  could  be  ascribed  to  rash-related  terms.  This  was  done  to 
avoid underestimating the effect of erlotinib on skin disorders by diluting the incidence across multiple 
preferred  terms.  An  overview  of  the  MedDRA  preferred  terms  which  were  included  in  the  composite 
“rash” term is shown in Table 8.

Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) data (Rosell et al., N Engl J Med (2009), 361:958-67.) 
Safety data from the SLCG screening feasibility trial were described in the publication by Rosell et al, 
2009. The most common AEs were skin rash, reported in 151 patients (69.6%) and diarrhoea reported 
in 95 patients (43.8%). The majority of AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. Grade 3 skin toxicity 
was recorded in 16 patients (7.4%) and grade 3 diarrhoea reported in 8 patients (3.7%). At the time 
of  the  analysis  for  the  publication,  no  patients  had  been  withdrawn  as  a  result  of  an  adverse  event. 
One  subject  was  diagnosed  with  interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD)  1  month  after  initiation  of  treatment 
with  erlotinib.  Erlotinib  treatment  was  temporarily  interrupted  and  the  event  resolved  following 
corticosteroid therapy.

No safety information was available for this study. 
CALGB30406 Phase II study (Janne et al., J Clin Oncol 28:7s, 2010)   
Safety  data  from  the  CALGB30406  trial  were  reported  for  all  patients  irrespective  of  EGFR  mutation 
status.  Of  the  82  patients  receiving  erlotinib  single  agent  therapy,  32  patients  were  identified  with 
EGFR  mutations  while  of  the  100  patients  receiving  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy,  35  patients  were 
identified with EGFR mutations. 
 
 
 
 
 
                                    
 
 
                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grade  3  or  4  toxicities  were  the  only  safety  data  reported  in  the  CALGB30406  study  comparing  first-
line erlotinib therapy alone or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with 
NSCLC  .  In  the  erlotinib  arm,  grade  3  or  4  hematologic  toxicities  were  reported  by  1  and  0  patients, 
respectively  (1%  of  patients  overall).  In  the  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  Grade  3  or  4 
hematologic toxicities were reported in 28 and 20 patients, respectively (28% of patients overall). 
Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities were reported by 17 and 2 patients, respectively, treated with 
single  agent  erlotinib  (17%  overall).  In  the  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  Grade  3  or  4  non-
hematologic toxicities were reported in 39 and 11 patients, respectively (50% overall).

IL D-like events
At the time of the data cut-off for the safety analysis of OPTIMAL study, a total of 72 patients (86.7%) 
in  the  erlotinib  treatment  arm  and  69  patients  (95.8%)  in  the  chemotherapy  treatment  arm  had 
reported at least one adverse event of any grade. The most common all grade AEs ( 10% incidence) 
in patients receiving erlotinib were skin rash (56 patients, 67.5%), ALT increased (25 patients, 30.1%) 
and diarrhoea (20 patients, 24.1%). In patients in the chemotherapy arm, the most common AEs were 
thrombocytopenia  (46  patients,  63.9%),  neutropenia  (49  patients,  68.1%),  anaemia  (52  patients, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
72.2%), fatigue (15 patients, 20.8%), skin rash (14 patients, 19.4%) and ALT increased (24 patients, 
33.3%).  Most  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
study  treatment  (66  patients,  79.5%  in  the  erlotinib  treatment  arm  and  68  patients,  94.4%  in  the 
chemotherapy arm).  
Grade  3 AEs were experienced by 13 patients (15.7%) in the erlotinib treatment arm and 45 patients 
(62.5%)  in  the  chemotherapy  arm,  the  most  common  event  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  being 
neutropenia (29 patients, 40.3%) and thrombocytopenia (28 patients, 38.9%). The only Grade  3 AE 
reported by more than one patient each in the erlotinib treatment arm was ALT increased (3 patients; 
3.6%). 
Ten patients in each treatment arm experienced a serious adverse event during study treatment. In 2 
erlotinib  treated  patients  and  all  10  chemotherapy-treated  patients,  the  serious  adverse  event  was 
considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Dose  reduction  was  reported  for  5  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (6.0%)  and  28  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy arm (38.9%). In the eroltinib arm, 4 patients had a dose reduction due to elevated ALT 
levels and one patient had a dose reduction due to stomatitis. 
 
Laboratory findings 
In  the  TARGET,  BO18192  and  ML20981  studies,  standard  haematology,  biochemistry  and  urinalysis 
tests  were  performed.  All  safety  laboratory  assessments  were  performed  locally.  Although  abnormal 
laboratory test parameter data were recorded, separate analyses of these data for patients with EGFR 
mutated tumours were not available from the studies included in this submission. 
  Safety in special populations 
No new information is available. 
  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information is available. 
  Discontinuation / interruption / dose reductions due to AES 
Dose  reductions/interruptions  for  AEs  were  permitted  to  take  place  at  any  time  during  each  of  the 
TARGET  and  BO18192  studies.  In  the  event  of  a  dose-limiting  toxicity  that  was  not  controlled  by 
optimal  supportive  care,  or  not  tolerated  due  to  symptomatology,  disfigurement,  or  interference  with 
normal daily activities, regardless of severity, the daily dose of erlotinib was to be decreased initially by 
50 mg/day. Within 2 weeks following a dose reduction, the erlotinib related toxicity had to improve by 
at least one NCI-CTC grade and be NCI-CTC Grade < 2, or further dose reduction by 50 mg/day was 
required. Dosing was permitted to be interrupted for a maximum of 2 weeks if clinically indicated and if 
the toxicity was not controlled by optimal supportive medication. 
In particular, erlotinib dosage modification for drug-related diarrhoea and rash was permitted. Once a 
patient had a dose reduction for toxicity, the dose was not re-escalated, except in the case of erlotinib-
related  rash.  In  TARGET  and  study  BO18192,  in  the  event  of  rash,  the  dose  could  be  re-escalated 
when the rash was Grade ≤ 2. 
In study ML20981, dose adjustments were to be considered in the event of grade 3-4 rash or diarrhoea 
not controlled by the active internal medicine, or for other grade 3-4 AEs. For skin rash or diarrhoea, 
re-medication was considered after recovery to grade 1 or less and with the dose of erlotinib reduced 
by 50 mg/day. For other AEs after temporary interruption of treatment, re-medication was considered 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  a  dose  reduction  of  50  mg  after  the  recovery  of  the  toxicity.  In  the  event  of  a  suspected  ILD, 
erlotinib was to be stopped immediately and only re-started if a diagnosis of ILD was not confirmed. 
 
Post marketing experience 
Post  marketing  data  are  of  minor  relevance  for  the  current  application  as  they  are  not  linked  to  the 
underlying mutational status. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data have been reported in the Spanish study by Rosell et al. As expected, the most common 
AEs  were  skin  rash,  reported  in  69.6%  of  patients  and  diarrhoea  reported  in  43.8%  of  patients.  The 
majority of AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. Grade 3 skin toxicity was recorded in 16 patients 
(7.4%) and grade 3 diarrhoea reported in 8 patients (3.7%). Unfortunately, the safety analysis was 
performed  for  all  patients  irrespective  of  line  of  therapy  why  it  is  of  limited  value  in  the 
evaluation  of  the  safety  of  erlotinib  as  first  line  therapy  in  NSCLC  patients  with  tumours 
bearing EGFR mutations. No safety data was available from the pooled study by Paz-Arez et al.  
Further  evidence  comes  from  the  prospectively  conducted  pivotal  EURTAC  study  that  included  75 
erlotinib-treated  patients  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  In  this  study,  almost  all  patients  treated 
experienced  AEs.  Common  AEs  associated  with  erlotinib  were  diarrhoea,  rash,  infections  (paronychia 
and  folliculitis),  cough  and  dyspnea.  More  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  experienced  severe 
events grade ≥ 3) (66.2%) than in the erlotinib arm (41.3%). The most common severe events in the 
erlotinib arm were infections followed by gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders like asthenia.  
The  frequency  of  SAEs  was  similar  between  treatment arms  (25.7%  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy 
arm vs. 26.7% in the erlotinib arm) but their nature differed.  In the erlotinib arm, only 5 events were 
considered  to  be  treatment-related  (diarrhea,  respiratory  tract  infection,  hepatotoxitiy  (grade  5), 
hyperbiliruminaemia, lung disorder). 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  given  as  1st  line  therapy  in  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR  mutated 
tumours  is  considered  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  described  in  later  lines  of 
therapy where only a minority of patients happened to harbour EGFR mutations. The most commonly 
reported AEs in the 1st line setting in patients with activating mutations were rash and diarrhoea and 
the  safety  profile  was  overall  manageable,  although  serious  or  severe  events  did  occur,  demanding 
dose  reductions  or  interruptions.  The  discontinuation  rate  was  low.  No  new  safety  signals  have  been 
identified.  Similarly,  EGFR  mutation  status  has  not  been  found  to  correlate  with  the  frequency  or 
severity of AEs during gefitinib treatment. There is no indication of a different safety profile of erlotinib 
in Caucasians compared to Asians why safety results from studies of Asian origin could be extrapolated 
to European populations. The MAH has not investigated whether a reduced erlotinib dose could actually 
“suffice” in the treatment of patients with EGFR activating mutations, but the proposed dosage is well-
characterized, and the safety profile is considered acceptable although adverse events of erlotinib are 
not negligible.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
N/A 
Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  submitted  a  revised  version  of  the  risk  management  plan  (version  3.1)  which  is  considered 
adequate  by  the  CHMP.  The  experience  with  Tarceva  in  both  clinical  trials  and  in  the  post-marketing 
setting is large and most side effects have been detected by now. 
The  safety  specification  is  adequate,  and  a  new  identified  risk  has  been  added  to  the  list  of  risks 
associated with Tarceva use. A drug-drug interaction with statins is a newly identified risk of Tarceva. 
This new risk is proposed to be handled by routine pharmacovigilance, and depending on the data the 
need  for  risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  evaluated.  The  rest  of  the  pharmacovigilance  plan  is 
adequate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  risk  minimisation,  the  MAH  has  generally  proposed  to  use  the  product  information.  This  is 
endorsed; therefore the RMP is relevant and adequate to cover the extension of indication. No further 
actions are warranted at this time.

fatalities) have been reported during use of 
Tarceva. Confounding factors have included 
pre-existing liver disease or concomitant 
hepatotoxic medications. Therefore, in such 
patients, periodic liver function testing should 
be considered. Tarceva dosing should be 
interrupted if changes in liver function are 
severe (see section 4.8). Tarceva is not 
recommended for use in patients with severe 
hepatic dysfunction.

Interaction with other medicinal products: 
caution should be used when erlotinib is 
combined with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, e.g. 
azole antifungals (i.e. ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole), protease 
inhibitors, erythromycin or clarithromycin. If 
necessary the dose of erlotinib should be 
reduced, particularly if toxicity is observed.

3. 4. Anti- EGFR Class labelling requested by the PhVWP/CHMP 
The Pharmacovigilance Working Party was requested by CHMP to consider whether a review of reports 
of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis should be undertaken, with a view to possible harmonisation of the 
PI for the EGFR inhibitor class of products.  
A review of reports of ocular toxicity associated with other EGFR inhibitors on the EudraVigilance 
database has revealed that cases of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis have been reported in association 
with the use of all marketed EGFR inhibitors. Consideration should therefore be given to harmonisation 
of the PI for the EGFR inhibitor class of products. 
The PhVWP considered the number of reports of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis across the EGFR class 
and agreed that warnings about keratitis and ulcerative keratitis should be updated across the class as 
follows: 
‘Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye 
inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred 
promptly to an ophthalmology specialist.  
If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with TRADENAME should be interrupted or 
discontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be 
carefully considered. 
Tarceva should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or severe 
dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration.’ 
This information was reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 and in the Package Leaflet sections 2 and 4. 
4.  Benefit risk assessment 
Benefits  
The  EURTAC  study  is  the  first  prospectively  conducted,  relatively  large  randomized,  unblinded  phase 
III trial comparing the efficacy of erlotinib to a standard platinum-based doublet regimen in the 1st line 
treatment of patients with EGFR activating mutations in Europe.  
Following review of the interim analysis results of the EURTAC study, the IDMC recommended stopping 
of the trial after demonstration of a substantial benefit of erlotinib over chemotherapy. At the time the 
HR for PFS was 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.64, p<0.0001) which corresponds to a 58 % reduction in the risk 
of progression or death. The Kaplan- Meier curves make a clear and early separation. The median PFS 
for patients in the chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in 
an absolute gain of 4.5 months in median PFS in erlotinib-treated patients. This is considered a highly 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinically  relevant  gain  in  PFS.  The  robustness  of  the  result  was  confirmed  in  a  number  of  sensitivity 
analyses,  sufficient  reassurance  has  been  provided  regarding  the  independent  review  process  and 
consistent results were found in subgroups with an acceptable sample size.  
Results from supportive trials and published literature confirm the findings of the EURTAC study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
N/A.  
Unfavourable effects  
In  conclusion,  the  overall  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  given  as  1st  line  therapy  in  NSCLC  patients  with 
EGFR mutated tumours is considered consistent with the known safety profile of erlotinib described in 
later lines of therapy where only a minority of patients happened to harbour EGFR mutations. The most 
commonly  reported  AEs  in  the  1st  line  setting  in  patients  with  activating  mutations  were  rash  and 
diarrhoea and the safety profile was overall manageable, although serious or severe events did occur, 
demanding  dose  reductions  or  interruptions.  The  discontinuation  rate  was  low.  No  new  safety  signals 
have been identified.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit  of  erlotinib  in  terms  of  PFS  compared  to  standard  chemotherapy  regimens  as  first  line 
therapy  of  patients  with  activating  EGFR  mutations  is  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  well 
documented.    
The  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  is  considered  acceptable,  well-characterized  and  distinct  from  the  well-
known  safety  profile  of  standard  chemotherapies.  The  oral  administration  of  erlotinib  provides 
convenience to the patient.  
Conclusion 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  variation 
application  EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0020  for  extending  the  indication  of  Tarceva  (erlotinib)  for  the  first-
line  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  with  activating 
EGFR mutations, is approvable.   
5.  Conclusion 
On 21 July 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

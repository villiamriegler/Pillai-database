2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2016 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing budesonide was 
considered justified based on clinical data showing improvement of kidney function in patients 
treated with the proposed product; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to progressive loss of kidney 
function leading to kidney failure requiring dialysis and transplantation; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
the sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently leading to end-
stage renal disease (ESRD). IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world and the 
prevalence rate varies across different geographical regions.  
The pathogenesis of primary IgA nephropathy is related to aberrantly glycosylated, galactose-deficient 
IgA1 that originate from the Peyer patches in the gastrointestinal mucosa. As such the pathogenesis is 
different from that of secondary forms of IgA nephropathy where the origin of IgA is heterogeneous 
(e.g. in the context of an autoimmune response), and primary IgA nephropathy is considered to be 
primarily a disease of the mucosal system. Related to this, the proposed product is expected to act 
locally on the Peyer patches in the intestinal mucosa, with low systemic absorption, addressing 
specifically the pathophysiology of primary but not secondary forms of IgA nephropathy. Thus, the 
COMP has previously decided that primary IgA nephropathy can be considered a medical entity valid 
for designation.   
The approved therapeutic indication “Kinpeygo is indicated for the treatment of primary 
immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) in adults at risk of rapid disease progression with a urine 
protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/gram.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of primary IgA nephropathy”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
IgAN is a progressive disease in which 20–40% of patients progress to end stage renal disease within 
10–20 years of diagnosis (Manno et al., 2007; Berthoux et al., 2008; Moriyama et al., 2014). Most 
patients are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s and therefore, face the prospect of dialysis or the need for 
kidney transplantation in the prime of their lives. It is estimated that IgAN accounts for 10% of renal 
transplants among patients with primary glomerulonephritis in the US, and between 7 – 20% of 
patients in Europe and Australia in long-term dialysis and renal transplantation programs.  
Post-transplant recurrence of IgAN is common. When compared to a group of non-diabetic patients 
who had received kidney transplants, kidney transplant patients with a primary diagnosis of IgAN had 
a higher cumulative graft failure rate, with the diagnosis of IgAN identified as an independent predictor 
of worse outcome in the long-term (Moroni et al., 2013). For IgAN patients with prior graft loss due to 
recurrent IgAN, the risk of IgAN recurrence in the second transplanted kidney (20–100%) is greatly 
increased (Choy et al., 2006). None of the current available immunosuppressive medicinal products are 
able to prevent the histological recurrence of IgAN (Floege, 2004). 
The COMP considers this condition as life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to progressive 
loss of kidney function leading to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis and transplantation. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposed a prevalence estimate of 4 in 10.000. This value is in line with the previously 
accepted estimate from the initial orphan designation in 2016. 
At the time of the original application in June 2016, and due to changes in case definition of IgA 
nephropathy and lack of standardized diagnosis across Europe and across the time span examined 
(from 1996 to 2016), the sponsor presented their own survey across European centres collecting 
information, Based on this, the EU prevalence of primary IgAN was set to approximately 4 in 10,000. 
For this maintenance report the sponsor has performed a new systematic search of peer-reviewed 
published medical literature on PubMed up to the current date (i.e. 24 June, 2021). No new 
information was found that would alter the conclusion on prevalence from the positive opinion by 
COMP in 2016 of approximately 4 in 10,000.  
The COMP agreed with the proposed prevalence estimate by the sponsor. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are currently no treatments approved for the management of patients with primary IgAN. 
Treatment recommendations are outlined in the KDIGO 2021 guideline. Standard of care comprises 
supportive therapy, which focuses on a lowering of proteinuria and optimal blood pressure control by 
maximum tolerated inhibition of the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS), together with a low sodium

diet (KDIGO 2021, Trimarchi et al 2019).  For patients with persistent proteinuria >1 g/day, rigorous 
blood pressure control with ACEIs (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ) and/or 
ARBs [RAS inhibitor therapy] to achieve blood pressure targets of <130/80 mm Hg is the cornerstone 
of therapy. When proteinuria persists despite optimal RAS inhibition with ACEIs/ARBs, patients are at 
risk of progression to ESRD, there are no further recommended treatments, and management options 
are generally limited to consideration of an off-label 6-month treatment course of high-dose 
systemic glucocorticosteroids (GCS).  
Of note, the COMP has previously considered Sandimmun as a satisfactory method for the treatment of 
primary IgA nephropathy in initial orphan designations. Sandimmun is an oil-based formulation of 
ciclosporin and has been authorised through a referral procedure across the EU for the treatment of 
nephrotic syndrome in diverse renal conditions covering IgAN (i.e. steroid dependent and steroid 
resistant nephrotic syndrome due to primary glomerular diseases such as minimal change 
nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, or membranous glomerulonephritis) 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/sandimmun-article-30-referral-annex-iii_en.pdf 
However, considering that the exact therapeutic indication wording and target population for Kinpeygo 
as per 4.1 of the SmPC, is now known and there is no full overlap with the therapeutic indication of 
Sandimmun, as Kinpeygo is also indicated for in patients with proteinurea who do not formally meet 
the criterion of nephrotic syndrome, it is not considered that Sandimmun is a satisfactory method in 
this case. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.  COMP position adopted on 20 May 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of primary IgA nephropathy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to progressive loss of kidney 
function which could ultimately lead to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis 
and transplantation; 
at present no satisfactory method has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of 
the entirety of patients covered by the therapeutic indication of Kinpeygo. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kinpeygo, budesonide for 
treatment of primary IgA nephropathy (EU/3/16/1778) is not removed from the Community Register 
of Orphan Medicinal Products.

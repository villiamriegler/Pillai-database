2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Levitra film-coated tablet contain vardenafil as the active substance and is indicated in the treatment 
of  erectile  dysfunction  in  adult  men.  Vardenafil  is  a  selective  inhibitor  of  phosphodiesterase 
type 5 (PDE5),  the  most  prominent  PDE  in  the  human  corpus  cavernosum.  During  sexual  stimulation 
nitric oxide is released resulting in an increased level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the 
corpus  cavernosum,  smooth  muscle  relaxation  and  induction  of  penile  erection.  Inhibiting  PDE5 
vardenafil  increases  the  level  of  cGMP  enhancing  relaxation  of  smooth  muscle,  which  increases  blood 
flow to the penis and induces penile erection. 
Currently Levitra is available as film-coated tablets containing 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of vardenafil. 
The  present  application  supports  a  line  extension  for  new  tablet  formulation  developed  as  single  oral 
dose  for  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction.  The  orodispersible  tablet  disintegrates  rapidly  in  the 
mouth in the presence of saliva and permits a convenient mode of intake without water. Patients who 
have difficulty swallowing tablets or who prefer a more discreet mode of administration of the product 
can benefit from using this form.  
Scientific  advice  was  not  received  from  the  CHMP  for  this  development.  The  condition  “erectile 
dysfunction” is exempted from the need to perform a paediatric development as it does not normally 
occur in the paediatric population. 
The  additional  pharmaceutical  form  is  applied  for  the  10  mg  vardenafil  strength  only.  There  are  no 
changes in the route of administration or indications compared to the currently approved film-coated 
tablets. The orodispersible tablets can be used as an alternative to the 10 mg film-coated tablets, but 
it has to be  considered that it is not a formulation equivalent to the current marketed  Levitra 10 mg 
film-coated tablet. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
New pharmaceutical form is presented as orodispersible tablets containing 10 mg of vardenafil (active 
substance) in form of the hydrochloride salt. Tablets are round and white, and are provided in blister 
packs containing 1, 2 or 4 tablets. Excipients used in the preparation of orodispersible tablets are well 
known  excipients  such  as  magnesium  stearate,  aspartame  (E951),  peppermint  flavour,  mannitol 
(E421), sorbitol (E420), crospovidone and silica colloidal hydrated. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The  drug  substance  used  in  this  formulation  is  identical  with  the  one  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the 
approved Levitra film-coated tablets (EU/1/03/248/001 – 012).

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Development  objective  was  to  provide  an  immediate  release  dosage  form  of  vardenafil  with  high 
convenience and patient compliance. Orodispersible tablets have been selected as dosage form which 
may be taken without water in a discreet manner. 
Prior  to  formulation  of  the  proposed  10  mg  orodispersible  tablet,  orodispersible  tablets  in  various 
strengths  had  been  investigated.  They  had  been  compressed  out  of  the  same  powder  blend  as  the 
current  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets.  Thus  previous  results  concerning  manufacture  and 
compressibility were valid for the 10 mg formulation. One strength of 10 mg was developed and tested 
in clinical trials.  
The  selected  tablet  size  was  considered  small  enough  to  support  convenient  intake  and  to  prevent 
gastrointestinal problems in sensitive patients caused by high doses of polyols. However the tablet size 
is large enough to allow easy handling also by elderly patients.  
Apart  from  flavour,  sweetener  and  lubricant,  the  formulation  is  solely  composed  of  the  direct 
compression  excipient  Pharmaburst  B2  which  is  commercially  available  mixture  of  crospovidone, 
mannitol,  silica  colloidal  hydrated  and  sorbitol.  The  ratio  between  the  active  substance  and  the  filler 
Pharmaburst  B2  was  determined  by  the  size  of  the  orodispersible  tablet.  The  slightly  bitter  taste  of 
vardenafil  hydrochloride  was  compensated  by  addition  of  1 %  aspartame  as  sweetener  and  1.5 % 
flavour peppermint. 
Compatibility  of  the  active  substance  with  standard  tablet  excipients  like  crospovidone,  magnesium 
stearate  or  silica  colloidal  anhydrous  has  already  been  known  from  the  previous  development  of  the 
coated  tablets.  Compatibility  with  specific  excipients  needed  for  the  formulation  of  orodispersible 
tablets  was  investigated  in  a  separate  study.  The  excipients  chosen  did  not  affect  the  appearance, 
assay  or  degradation  products,  there  was  no  sign  of  significant  degradation  of  the  drug  substance. 
Compatibility was further demonstrated by the finished product stability studies. 
Vardenafil hydrochloride orodispersible tablets are manufactured in a direct-compression process. The 
components  are  blended  and  compressed  into  final  tablets  on  a  standard  rotary  press.  During 
development  and  scale-up  the  impact  of  manufacturing  conditions  on  key  quality  attributes  were 
investigated.  As  rapid  disintegration  of  orodispersible  tablets  based  on  Pharmaburst  B2  is  only 
achieved  if  addition  of  any  binder  is  avoided,  the  powder  blend  is  not  granulated.  Thus,  a  direct 
compression process has been established. 
•  Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients present in the formulation are of animal or human origin. Magnesium stearate 
used in the manufacturing process of the medicinal product is of vegetal origin. 
•  Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  described  with  defined  critical  steps.  A  flow  diagram  and 
detailed  description  of  the  process  have  been  provided.  The  manufacturing  process  comprises  the 
following steps: (1) Premixing, (2) Final blending, (3) Tablet compression and (4) Packaging. 
Standard in-process controls are routinely performed during the manufacturing process to control the 
drug  product  quality.  Acceptance  criteria  and  specification  limits  have  been  set-up.  The  proposed  in-
process control tests are adequate to control the critical steps of the manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 5/39 
 
 
 
 
The validation was performed with 3 consecutive batches at commercial scale. All manufacturing steps, 
in-process controls and quality tests were performed in accordance to the requirements and complied 
with  the  specification.  The  evaluation  of  these  batches  was  based  on  manufacturing  process 
parameters, in process control data that accompanied every production batch, and additional tests that 
were carried out only in the validation phase. Each validation batch was tested for compliance with the 
release specification. 
•  Product specification 
The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, 
identification  (HPLC,  TLC  or  NIR),  friability,  water  content,  disintegration,  uniformity  of  dosage  units, 
assay, degradation products (HPLC) and microbial limits. 
Full  details  of  all  analytical  methods  were  provided.  All  non  pharmacopoeial  methods  have  been 
satisfactory validated.  
The  same  HPLC  method  is  for  identification,  assay  and  degradation  products.  The  method  has  been 
validated  with  regard  to  specificity,  linearity  for  the  active  substance  and  specified  degradation 
products, accuracy (recovery rate) for the active substance and specified degradation products, limit of 
detection and quantitation for the active substance and specified degradation products, precision of the 
instrument,  precision  of  the  method  for  the  active  substance  and  specified  degradation  products 
intermediate precision of the method for the active substance and specified degradation products and 
robustness. It has been demonstrated that the method for assay and degradation products is suitable 
for the determination of vardenafil and its degradation products in orodispersible tablets. 
The  acceptance  criteria  and  analytical  methods  are  adequate  to  assure  the  strength,  quality,  identity 
and purity of the finished product.  
Batch  analysis  data  was  provided  on  three  commercial  scale  batches.  Batches  met  the  proposed 
specification  limits.  Results  showed  that  orodispersible  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according to the finished product specifications. 
•  Stability of the product 
Long-term  stability  data  were  provided  for  3  commercial  scale  batches  stored  at  30°C/75 %  relative 
humidity (RH) in order to prove that the product is stable in climatic zones I - IV.  
Additionally, 18 months stability data were provided for one laboratory scale batch packed in the same 
primary  packaging  after  storage  at  25°C/60 %  RH  and  at  30°C/75 %  RH.  The  stability  data  were 
evaluated against the proposed shelf life specification. 
Accelerated  studies  at  40°C/75 %  RH  have  been  performed  over  a  period  of  6  months.  Test 
parameters, methods and specification were the same as described for the long-term stability studies. 
The tablets were stable under accelerated storage conditions over the test period of 6 months. 
The  applicant  also  performed  stressed  stability  testing.  For  stress  stability  testing,  the  samples  were 
exposed to heat, humidity and light. 
In  order  to  investigate  the  stability  of  the  product  under  moist  conditions  (humidity  stress)  tablets 
were  stored  in  open  containers  at  25°C/60 %  RH,  30°C/75 %  RH  and  40°C/75 %  RH  for  8  weeks.  It 
has been demonstrated that the formulation is humidity sensitive and need to be stored in the original 
water-tight package to prevent exposure to high ambient humidity. 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 6/39 
 
 
 
 
Unprotected tablets exposed to light showed signs of decomposition of the active substance however, 
the assay results and the amount of degradation products still remained within the specification limits. 
Only the discoloration proceeded rapidly. 
Although  tablets  were  shown  to  be  sensitive  to  humidity  and  slightly  sensitive  to  light  it  shows  good 
chemical  and  physical  stability  when  adequately  protected  by  a  hermetic  primary  container.  This 
confirms  that  aluminium  blisters  which  have  been  chosen  as  the  packaging  material  for  clinical  trial 
and commercial supply are appropriate.  
In addition to the blistered samples one commercial scale tablet batch was tested as bulk material and 
stored  in  the  chosen  container  material  at  25°C/60  %  RH,  30°C/75  %  RH  and  40°C/75  %  RH.  Data 
were  available  for  a  storage  period  of  12  months  at  25  °C/60  %  RH  and  for  1  month  storage  at 
30°C/75 % RH and 40°C/75 % RH. All parameters remained unchanged under the storage conditions 
tested  and  it  was  possible  to  conclude  that  the  bulk  packaging  offers  sufficient  protection  for  the 
tablets.  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines  the  stability  studies  will  be  continued  following  the  stability 
protocol and any out-of-specification result will be reported to the authorities. 
Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
In summary the stability data provided support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The drug substance used in this formulation is identical with the one used in the manufacture of film-
coated tablets. 
The  new  pharmaceutical  form  that  was  proposed  is  orodispersible  tablets  containing  10 mg  of 
vardenafil  (active  substance)  in  form  of  the  hydrochloride  salt.  Excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of 
orodispersible tablets are well known excipients. 
The description and composition of the product are properly documented.  
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  drug  product  is  adequately  and  sufficiently  described.  The 
information given supports the formula and the pharmaceutical form selected.  
The method of manufacture is standard. Description of the manufacturing process, in-process controls, 
critical  steps  and  their  controls  and  methods  applied  are  satisfactory.  All  critical  in-process  controls 
parameters are well established and justified. 
The control of excipients is satisfactory. 
The drug product specification has been correctly discussed and the limits proposed for each test have 
been  established  taking  into  account  the  data  of  clinical  and  stability  batches.  In  general,  the 
specifications are acceptable.  
Analytical methods used to control the quality of the finished product are well described and validated 
according ICH.  
The stability studies have been performed on three scale commercial batches. The proposed shelf-life 
and storage condition are justified.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of orodispersible tablets has been presented in 
a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
To support this application two pivotal, placebo controlled, randomized Phase III trials (Studies 12093 
and 12094; Table 2) with a treatment period of 12 weeks have been conducted to support efficacy and 
safety of the Levitra 10 mg ODT. In addition the clinical program included three Phase I trials (Studies 
10021, 12769 and 13396; Table 1) which provided pharmacokinetic results in healthy volunteers as in 
patients with erectile dysfunction. 
The  initial  development  strategy  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  of  the  orodispersable 
tablets  (ODTs)  with  the  approved  film-coated  tablets  (FCTs).  As  the  orodispersable  formulation 
showed  suprabioavailability,  clinical  studies  to  demonstrate  efficacy  and  efficacy  in  patients  with 
erectile dysfunctions were performed. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
•  Methods 
Analytical Methods 
Sampling Scheme 
 On  the  PK  profile  days  as  defined  in  the  studies,  venous  blood  samples  were  taken  for  the 
determination of plasma concentrations of vardenafil. A typical schedule was comprised of a pre-dose 
sample and 17 sampling time points after administration as detailed in the following: 10*, 20, 30 and 
45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5*, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 24 hours (h) (* not used in study 12093).  
Determination of vardenafil concentrations in human plasma  
Vardenafil (in free base equivalents) plasma concentrations were measured using fully validated high-
performance liquid chromatography assays with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). 
Deuterated analogues of vardenafil (i.e. [2H5]-vardenafil) were used as internal standard (ISTD) for the 
respective  analyte.  Monitored  ion  transitions  (m/z)  were  489  →  151  (312)  for  vardenafil  and  494  (cid:31) 
151 (312) for the [2H5]-labelled ISTD. The applied calibration range of the procedure reached from the 
lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ;  0.1  –  0.123 μg/l)  to  50  –  52.5 μg/l.  The  concentrations  were 
validated by assaying quality control samples of blank plasma spiked with known concentrations of the 
analytes.  Concentrations  above  LLOQ  were  determined  with  a  precision  of  better  than  15%  and 
accuracy  within  85 – 115%  in  accordance  with  internal  SOPs  and  pertinent  guidelines  on  method 
validation 
Determination of vardenafil concentrations in human saliva 
Vardenafil concentrations in saliva were determined after dilution employing HPLC with gradient elution 
and  ultraviolet  (UV)  absorbance  detection  at  230  nm  wavelength.  The  working  range  comprised 
concentrations in the range 0.0206 to 8.23 µg/l. Accuracy / precision in calibrators were 92.8% / 9.4% 
at the LLOQ and 98.1-100.6% / 0.25-1.5% above LLOQ. The QC samples were determined with 98.4% 
accuracy and 2.5% precision. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The linear-logarithmic trapezoidal method was used to calculate AUC, and t1/2 was estimated by linear 
least squares regression after logarithmic transformation of the terminal concentrations. Based on the 
plasma  concentration  time  data  the  following  parameters  were  calculated  using  non-compartmental 
methods.  
Cmax and AUC values were dose- and body weight normalized ([Cmax,norm] and [AUCnorm]), according to 
the dose in milligram per kilogram body weight. Plasma concentration–time courses (calculated if two 
thirds or more of individual values were greater than the LLOQ, at the scheduled time) are presented 
as geometric mean values with or without geometric standard deviations. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
(except  tmax)  are  presented  as  geometric  mean  values  including  geometric  coefficient  of  variation 
[%CV] and range. Results for tmax are presented as median [range]. 
•  Absorption  
Vardenafil hydrochloride (HCl) is highly soluble in aqueous media at pH 1, however, due to the strong 
decrease in solubility with increasing pH a dose of 10 mg (vardenafil) is not completely soluble at pH 
values above 4.5 (250 ml of aqueous medium; 37 °C). Vardenafil is a highly permeable drug in vitro in 
the  Caco-2-cell  model.  Due  to  the  low  solubility  at  neutral  pH  vardenafil  HCl  is  a  BCS  class  2  drugs.

This  condition  makes  that  a  small  amount  of  vardenafil  is  bioavailable  in  the  oral  cavity  as  it  was 
studied in the mechanistic study 10021. 
o  Study 10021: Study to investigate local oral absorption 
Randomized,  unblinded,  two  fold  crossover  study  was  performed  in  10  healthy  male  subjects  (aged 
33.8 (26 – 43) years; mean (range)) in order to investigate the local bioavailability of vardenafil in the 
oral  cavity.  Fasted  subjects  received  a  solution  of  10  mg  vardenafil  as  HCl  salt  which  they  either 
swallowed with water or rested into the oral cavity, respectively. Subjects remained in a sitting position 
while  they  kept  the  solution  in  their  mouth  for  15  minutes  and  were  instructed  not  to  swallow. 
Subsequently  they  emptied  their  mouth  and  rinsed  it  with  5 x 20  ml  water.  The  mouth  rinses  were 
collected,  combined  and  subject  to  analysis  of  vardenafil  concentrations  in  order  to  estimate  the 
amount of drug absorbed in the oral cavity. 
The relative bioavailability frel (ratio of AUC values) after local administration was 24.6 (17.0 - 35.6) % 
(point  estimate  (90%  CI))  compared  to  oral  (swallowed)  intake  of  a  solution  containing  10  mg 
vardenafil  as  HCl.  A  pronounced  lag  time  (tlag)  of  about  30  minutes  was  noted  and  the  rate  of 
absorption  was  slower  after  local  oral  compared  to  gastrointestinal  absorption  resulting  in  a  delay  in 
median tmax of 2 h (see Figure 1). The terminal elimination half-lives (3.5 and 3.6 h) were independent 
of formulation. The pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 3. 
The amount of drug recovered in saliva and water collected after rinsing the oral cavity was equal to 
92  (48  –  113)%  (arithmetic  mean  (range))  of  the  sublingually  administered  dose.  Assuming  a 
negligible  portion  of  vardenafil  swallowed  after  local  oral  administration  it  can  be  inferred  that  about 
8%  of  the  dose  (0.8  mg  vardenafil)  was  absorbed  in  the  oral  cavity.  The  vardenafil  AUC  after 
administration to the oral cavity (4.904 µg*h/l) resulting from this small dose compares to an AUC of 
19.91  µg*h/l  after  gastrointestinal  absorption  of  a  10 mg  dose.  The  relative  bioavailability  frel*  of 
vardenafil  after  local  oral  absorption  based  on  the  actual  absorbed  dose  (ratio  of  [AUC/Dose])  is 
estimated  at  308%.  This  study  indicates  that  a  small  amount  of  vardenafil  is  absorbed  in  the  oral 
cavity with increased bioavailability.

Bioavailability 
Study 12769: Relative bioavailability, effect of food and effect of water 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  four-fold  crossover  study  in  healthy  young  male  subjects  (mean 
age  and  range:  37.8  (29  –  49)  years,  n=13  valid  for  pharmacokinetics).  The  study  compared  the 
pharmacokinetics of 10 mg vardenafil as ODT (fasting, w/o water) and film-coated tablet (fasting, with 
180  mL  water),  and  investigated  the  effect  of  a  high  fat,  high  calorie  breakfast  on  ODT  taken  w/o 
water.  Levitra  ODT  was  administered  30  minutes  after  start  of  the  meal.  A  fourth  treatment  arm 
investigated  the  effect  of  water  (180 ml)  administered  together  with  the  10  mg  ODT  in  the  fasting 
condition in order to assess the pharmacokinetic changes in subjects who are con-compliant with the 
recommended mode of administration (i.e. w/o water). 
When  administered  w/o  water  Levitra  ODT  demonstrated  suprabioavailability  in  comparison  to  film-
coated tablet i.e. its mean bioavailability (AUC) was increased by 44% (point estimate and 90% CI of 
ratio  [ODT  fasted  w/o  water  vs.  film-coated  tablet]:  144  (132-158)  %).  The  AUC  increase  was 
observed  from  about  1  h  post  administration  onwards  and  is  attributed  to  the  local  absorption  of 
vardenafil in the oral cavity with increased bioavailability. The change in shape of plasma-concentration 
vs. time profile translated into a small increase in mean residence time (MRT) from 4.6 h (film-coated 
tablet) to 5.0 h (ODT). With the rate of absorption through the oral mucosa being slow, Cmax was less 
affected with the 90% CI of the ratio including unity (point estimate and 90% CI of ratio [ODT fasted 
w/o water vs. film-coated tablet]: 115 (94-140) %). ODT intake w/o water also resulted in an increase 
in median tmax of 0.75 h compared to film-coated tablet. In the treatment ’10 mg ODT w/o water’ the 
geometric CV% as a measure of inter-subject variability was numerically smaller for AUC compared to 
film-coated tablet (42 vs. 55%), while Cmax demonstrated similar variability (51 vs. 50%). 
If  taken  with  water  (180  ml)  the  concentration  vs.  time  profiles  of  ODT  and  film-coated  tablet  were 
similar and the ODT was no longer suprabioavailable in comparison to film-coated tablet, with the AUC 
ratio and 90% CI ([ODT fasted with water / film-coated tablet] of 103 (94.0 – 113)%) complying with 
bioequivalence  criteria.  Under  these  conditions  of  intake  with  water,  Cmax  demonstrated  a  10% 
increase  (point  estimate  and  90%  CI  [ODT  with  water  /  film-coated  tablet]:  110  (90  –  135)  %)  and 
median tmax was reduced by 0.25 h compared to 10 mg film-coated tablet (0.75 to 0.5 h). If the ODT is

taken  with  water,  vardenafil  is  completely  swallowed  and  its  residence  time  in  the  oral  cavity  is  not 
sufficient  to  allow  permeation  of  the  oral  mucosa.  When  comparing  ‘ODT  with  water’  to  ‘ODT  w/o 
water’ these effects of intake with water translate into a decrease in AUC by 29%, increased  Cmax (- 
4%) and a decrease in median tmax by 1 h (1.5 to 0.5 h). 
Administration  of  the  ODT  with  a  high  fat/high  calorie  meal  had  no  effect  on  vardenafil  AUC  (point 
estimate and 90% CI of ratio [fed / fasting]: 98 (89 – 107) %) while Cmax was reduced by 35% (Cmax 
ratio [fed / fasting]: 65 (53 – 79) %). Food had no effect on the time to reach Cmax. Geometric CV % 
values for exposure parameters were numerically smaller if the ODT was taken with food (36 vs. 42% 
(AUC)  and  34  vs.  51%  (Cmax),  fed  vs.  fasted  condition).  Given  the  lack  of  food  effect  on  extent  of 
bioavailability, slight reduction in Cmax and unchanged tmax with food, it can be concluded that Levitra 
ODT can be administered without regard to food intake.

• 
Impaired renal function 
Renal  impairment  was  already  investigated  in  detail  with  the  film-coated  tablet  and  the  results  are 
considered to apply to the ODT. 
Vardenafil pharmacokinetics was similar in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment compared 
with  a  normal  renal  function  control  group.    No  statistically  significant  correlation  was  observed 
between creatinine clearance and vardenafil plasma exposure.  Subjects with severe renal impairment 
showed a 21% increase in mean vardenafil AUC and a decrease in mean Cmax of 23% compared with 
subjects with normal renal function. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
Hepatic  impairment  was  already  investigated  in  detail  with  the  film-coated  tablet  and  the  results  are 
considered to apply to the ODT. 
Vardenafil  clearance  was  reduced  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  B) 
resulting  in  2.6-fold  and  2.3-fold  increased  AUC  and  Cmax,  compared  with  healthy  controls.  Subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) demonstrated 1.2-fold increased AUC and Cmax, compared 
with the control group.   
•  Gender 
Levitra orodispersable tablets are not indicated for use by women. 
•  Race 
Race was already investigated in detail with the film-coated tablet and exposure has been shown to be 
comparable in subjects of different ethnic origin. 
•  Elderly 
The  covariate  “age”  was  specifically  investigated  for  Levitra  ODT  in  view  of  the  possibility  of  local 
absorption in the oral cavity being age-dependent. 
The age-effect was investigated in the Study 13396. 
o  Study 13396:  Multiple-dose  study  to  investigate  the  effect  of  age  in  male  patients  with 
erectile dysfunction 
Male  ED  patients  were  stratified  by  age  according  to  the  categories  18  to  ≤45  years  (n=14),  >45  to 
<65  years  (n=6),  ≥65  to  <70  years  (n=7)  and  ≥70  years  (n  =  7).  The  primary  comparison  to 
evaluate the effect of age was performed between subjects ≥65 years (actual mean (range): 70.5 (65 
– 80) years; n=14) and ≤45 years (actual mean (range): 39.9 (31 – 45) years; n=14). The subjects 
received a single dose of 10 mg film-coated tablet with water on study day 1 followed by a wash-out of 
2  days  duration.  Subsequently,  10  repeated  once-daily  doses  of  10  mg  ODT  were  administered  w/o 
water  with  pharmacokinetic  profiles  being  collected  after  the  first  dose  (study  day  4)  and  last  dose 
(study day 13). Drug intake on day 1, 4 and 13 was in the fasting condition while administrations on 
days  5-12  were  performed  after  a  standardized  Continental  breakfast.  Study  13396  showed  that  age

has similar effects on the systemic vardenafil exposure of Levitra ODT and film-coated tablet. However 
the relative suprabioavailability of Levitra ODT compared to 10 mg film-coated tablet was decreased in 
the elderly.  
•  Children 
Levitra orodispersable tablets are not indicated for individuals below 18 years of age.  
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The effects of CYP3A4 inhibitor co medication on the metabolism of vardenafil have been investigated 
in detail with the marketed Levitra film-coated tablet and are also considered to apply to the ODT.

No specific studies have been conducted in support of this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Not applicable as no new pharmacodynamics data was required. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data in support of this application relate to pharmacokinetic aspects. 
The applicant calculated that about 8% (0.8 mg) of the dose is absorbed from the oral cavity. However, 
considering that the amount of drug recovered in saliva and water collected after rinsing the oral cavity 
showed a high variability in the amount of drug recovered (48 – 113)% (arithmetic mean (range)) and 
also  taking  into  account  that  the  sample  used  (10  subjects)  seems  to  be  short,  the  8%  of  dose 
absorbed can be considered as an approximation. Nevertheless, the important issue is that part of the 
dose  is  absorbed  in  the  oral  cavity,  which  would  avoid  to  some  extent  the  hepatic  first  pass  effect 
leading to an increase of bioavailability. 
In  a  relative  bioavailability  study  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  ODT  shows  suprabioavailability  in 
comparison to the film coated tablet. It means bioavailability was increased by 44% point estimate and 
90% CI of ratio [ODT fasted w/o water vs. film-coated tablet]: 144 (132-158) %, which is attributed to 
the local absorption of vardenafil in the oral cavity. This information is clearly reflected in the SPC to 
allow prescribers knowing that Levitra ODT 10 mg and Levitra film coated tablet are not equivalent.  
In this study Levitra 10 mg ODT in the fasted state showed a median time to reach Cmax between 45 
to  90  min,  which  supposes  an  increase  in  median  Tmax  of  0.75h  compared  to  film-coated.  When 
Levitra  ODT  was  taken  with  a  high  fat/high  calorie  meal,  no  effect  on  vardenafil  AUC  was  observed, 
while  Cmax  was  reduced  by  35%  and  food  had  no  effect  on  the  time  to  reach  Cmax.  So  it  can  be 
concluded that the ODT can be administrated without regard to food intake 
If  the  ODT  is  taken  with  water,  vardenafil  is  completely  swallowed  and  its  residence  time  in  the  oral 
cavity  is  not  sufficient  to  allow  absorption  in  the  oral  cavity.  This  way  AUC  showed  bioavailability 
equivalence  to  the  film  coated  tablet.  However, Tmax  was  reduced  by  0.25h  compared  to  the  10  mg 
film coated tablet and Cmax showed a 10% increase. This point is already included in the SPC under 
section “method of administration”.

The  submitted  studies  have  demonstrated  time-linear  pharmacokinetics  and  unchanged  AUC  after

All special requirements for special population emerged from the studies have been properly included 
in the SPC. 
Overall, what is important to highlight is that Levitra 10 mg orodispersable tablet is not bioequivalent 
to  Levitra  10  mg  film  coated  tablet,  and  therefore  should  not  be  used  as  an  equivalent.  This 
information should be useful to avoid taken two tablets for a 20 mg dose. The Applicant has included 
this  information  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC,  indicating:  “Levitra10  mg  orodispersable  tablet  is  not 
bioequivalent  to  Levitra  film-coated  tablet  (see  section  5.1).  The  maximum  dose  for  Levitra 
orodispersable is 10 mg/day”. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic studies show that the ODT is suprabioavailable when compared to Levitra film coated 
tablets.  
Although a direct comparison between the 10 mg ODT and the 10 mg film coated tablets would have 
been desirable, the information provided with the submitted study is considered acceptable as this new 
formulation, dose and systemic exposure fall into the characteristic flat dose response curve linked to 
this active substance. 
The  submitted  documentation  showed  that  Levitra  PK  levels  are  inside  the  efficacy/safety  window 
considered  for  Levitra  film  coated  tablets.  However,  Levitra  10  mg  ODT  has  showed  higher 
suprabioavailability than Levitra film-coated tablet, so both formulations are not bioequivalent.

Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The marketing authorization was granted for Levitra 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film coated tablets. The 
10 mg is considered the starting dose, however as general precaution a lower starting dose of 5 mg is 
recommended for subjects ≥ 65 years of age. The MAH considered that since Levitra ODT 10 mg dose 
is within the EU approved dose range for Levitra film-coated tablets, a higher or lower dose-finding for 
Levitra ODT was considered unnecessary and a single dose (10 mg) clinical development program was 
pursued. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
The Applicant has submitted two phase III pivotal studies; 12093 and 12094. 
Study  12093:  Pivotal phase III trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of an Orodispersible Tablet 
vardenafil  versus  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  men  with  Erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  –  a  fixed-dose, 
double-blind, randomized multi-centre Trial – POTENT I. 
Study  12094:  Pivotal phase III trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of an Orodispersible Tablet 
vardenafil  versus  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  men  with  erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  –  a  fixed-dose, 
double-blind, randomized multi-centre Trial – POTENT II. 
Study 12093 was carried out in 40 centres. Study 12094 was carried out in 35 active centres.

METHODS 
The design of both studies was identical and the following is therefore applicable to both studies. 
Study Participants  
Both studies enrolled men in a stable heterosexual relationship lasting for at least 6 months, 18 years 
or  older,  with  ED  of  more  than  6  months’  duration,  as  defined  by  the  NIH  Consensus  Development 
Panel  on  Impotence  (inability  to  achieve  or  maintain  an  erection  of  the  penis  sufficient  to  permit 
satisfactory sexual performance).  
Subjects were required to make at least 4 attempts at sexual intercourse on separate days during the 
1-month  untreated  baseline  period,  with  at  least  50%  of  these  attempts  reported  to  be  unsuccessful 
(inability to get an erection, failed penetration, or maintenance of an erection). 
Subject exclusion criteria 
The exclusion criteria ensured the correct diagnosis of ED and a population representative of subjects 
with  ED.  Subjects  who  may  have  had  conditions  that  would  have  posed  a  risk  during  sexual  activity 
according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  Consensus  Panel  were  excluded  to  ensure  safe 
conduct  of  the  study.  Thus,  subjects  with  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  illnesses  within  the 
preceding  6 months  such  as  unstable  angina,  history  of  myocardial infarction,  stroke, life-threatening 
arrhythmia  were  excluded.  Subjects  with  congenital  QT  prolongation  or  on  drugs  known  to  cause 
significant  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  (in  particular  Type  Ia  and  Type  3  anti-arrhythmics), 
significant  hypo-  and  hypertension,  uncontrolled  atrial  fibrillation  or  flutter  (defined  as  a  ventricular 
response  rate  of  ≥100  beats  per  minute),  as  well  as  subjects  with  a  history  of  syncope  or  clinically 
significant postural hypotension within the six months prior to study entry were also excluded.  
Concomitant use of nitrates or other nitric oxide donors as well as anti-androgens and alpha-blockers 
were  also  exclusion  criteria.  Any  use  of  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  such  as  ketoconazole,  itraconazole, 
ritonavir  and  indinavir  but  also  of  the  macrolide  antibiotics  clarithromycin  and  erythromycin  were 
excluded from concomitant use with the 10 mg ODT. 
Treatments 
Vardenafil  was  supplied  as  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets  (ODT)  and  matching  placebo  tablets.  Both 
active study drug and placebo had the same peppermint taste. 
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects were stratified according to their age (18 to 64 and ≥ 65 years-of-age) 
and randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to vardenafil or placebo. 
Subjects  received  1  tablet  per  day.  At  Visit  2  (Week  0),  all  subjects  received  30  tablets  of  study 
medication, which was sufficient for the first 4 weeks of treatment and at Visit 3 (Week 4), 60 tablets 
of study medication which was sufficient for the last 8 weeks of treatment. 
The subject was to take the study medication approximately one hour before intended sexual activity. 
Study  medication  was  to  be  taken  on  demand,  but  no  more  than  one  dose  of  study  drug  was  to  be 
taken per day. 
Subjects were instructed that the study medication was not to be swallowed whole. Instead, the study 
medication tablets were to be placed in the oral cavity where they would quickly disintegrate. The ODT 
was taken without liquids 
In  both  studies  patients  were  to  take  the  study  medication  approximately  one  hour  before  intended 
sexual activity. The SPC should recommend to take the medication also one hour before sexual activity.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  vardenafil  ODT  10  mg 
(PRN) after 12 weeks of treatment or LOCF with placebo in a general population of men with erectile 
dysfunction.  
In  these  studies,  approximately  50%  of  the  men  on  active  treatment  have  to  be  65  years-of-age  or 
older to get information on the safety profile as the 10 mg ODT formulation has a higher bioavailability 
when  compared  the  10  mg  film  coated  tablet  added  to  the  fact  that  the  elderly  patients  have  higher 
AUC and Cmax values than younger patients with both formulations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy parameters 
The efficacy of Levitra ODT was determined using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a 
15-item  questionnaire  that  has  proven  a  reliable,  cross-culturally  valid,  self-administered  measure  of 
erectile  function.    The  15  items  cover  five  domains:  erectile  function  (6  items),  orgasmic  function  (2 
items),  sexual  desire  (2  items),  intercourse  satisfaction  (3 items),  and  overall  sexual  satisfaction  (2 
items).  
Apart from the IIEF questionnaire, two event diary questions derived from the Sexual Encounter Profile 
(SEP), measuring success in penetration and maintenance of successful intercourse, were included as 
primary co-variables for the evaluation of efficacy. 
Primary measures of efficacy for the two studies were: 
- The baseline-adjusted erectile function (EF) domain score of the IIEF, calculated as the sum of scores 
from questions 1 to 5 and 15 at Week 12, using the LOCF method to account for missing data. These 6 
questions  measure  the  frequency  of  achieving  erections,  the  frequency  of  achieving  erections  with 
sufficient  rigidity  for  penetration,  the  frequency  of  penetration,  the  frequency  of  maintenance  of 
erection  after  penetration,  the  ability  to  maintain  erections  to  completion  of  intercourse,  and 
confidence  in  obtaining  and  maintaining  an  erection.  Depending  on  the  question  in  the  IIEF,  the 
responses were scored either from 0 to 5, or 1 to 5, with 0 for no attempt at sexual intercourse. The 
responses were evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as covariate and with the 
treatment  and  center  as  factors,  presenting  the  least  squares  (LS)  means  at  baseline  and  post-
randomization  together  with  the  standard  error  (SE)  for  the  LS  means  for  each  treatment.  In 
agreement  with  the  CPMP  recommendations  (CPMP/EWP/2863/99,  2003),  the  stratum  variable  ‘age’ 
was also tentatively included as an additional factor. ED can be classified into five categories based on 
the  EF  domain  score:  severe  (6-10),  moderate  (11-16),  mild  to  moderate  (17-21),  mild  (22-25)  and 
no ED (26-30). 
-  Success  in  penetration  (“Were  you  able  to  insert  your  penis  into  your  partner’s  vagina?”) 
according  to  the  subject’s  diary  from  randomization  to  Week  12  (overall)  using  the  per-subject 
overall success rate. 
- Success in maintaining erection during intercourse (“Did your erection last long enough for you to 
have  successful  intercourse?”)  according  to  the  subject’s  diary  from  randomization  to  Week  12 
(overall) using the per-subject overall success rate. 
The  answers  to  these  two  questions  on  penetration  and  maintenance  of  erection  came  from  the 
subject’s  diary  and  were  collected  after  every  attempt  at  intercourse  during  the  untreated  baseline 
phase,  and  capturing  each  attempt  at  intercourse  over  a  24-hour  period  after  every  dose  of  study 
medication during the double-blind treatment phase. 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 19/39 
 
 
 
 
Per-subject success rates were calculated as the total number of successes divided by the total number 
of  sexual  attempts  in  an  interval,  and  baseline  was  calculated  from  the  subject’s  diary  completed 
during  the  4-week  baseline  phase.  The  primary  time  point  for  assessing  efficacy  for  these  two  diary 
questions  in  both  efficacy  studies  was  predefined  as  the  overall  interval  from  randomization  to  Week 
12.  No substitution was made for missing values in overall per-subject success rates. 
Secondary efficacy parameters 
Secondary measures of efficacy included subjects achieving “back to normal” erectile function scores in 
the  IIEF  questionnaire,  as  well  as  responses  on  the  subject’s  diary  concerning  success  of  intercourse 
attempts,  overall  satisfaction  with  sexual  experience,  the  Treatment  Satisfaction  Scale  (TSS)  and  the 
Global Assessment Question (GAQ).  
Sample size 
The  number  of  subjects  required  in  this  study  was  based  on  the  primary  efficacy  variables,  the  EF 
domain score of the IIEF Questionnaire, and the success rates (coprimaries) of penetration (SEP 2) and 
maintenance (SEP 3) obtained from the data collected in the Subject Diaries. No alpha adjustment was 
required  under  the  restriction  that  the  IIEF-EF,  the  SEP  2,  and  the  SEP  3  had  to  be  simultaneously 
significant. However, the power of the total test was affected by the presence of coprimary endpoints 
and consequently, this impacted the sample size.  
For the case of the two co-primary efficacy variables, a good lower boundary for the overall power of 
the analyses was one minus the sum of the probability of the type II error for each variable. 
Randomisation 
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were stratified according to 
their age (18 to 64 years-of-age and ≥ 65 years-of-age) and randomly and equally assigned (using a 1 
to 1 ratio) to either vardenafil 10 mg ODT or placebo ODT according to a randomization code that was 
computer generated by the sponsor. The study was randomized in blocks of appropriate size meant to 
ensure  a  balance  in  terms  of  subjects  between  treatment  groups.  In  order  to  achieve  the  intended 
allocation  of  50%  of  all  subjects  older  than  65  years-of-age,  a  forced  randomization  procedure  was 
used.  
Blinding (masking) 
In  this  randomized,  double-blind,  multicentre,  parallel-arm  trial,  blinding  was  maintained  until 
completion of the study. 
Statistical methods 
All  quantitative  clinical  variables  were  tabulated  as  descriptive  statistics  using  sample  sizes,  means, 
standard  deviations,  minimum  and  maximum,  and  the  median  per  item,  domain,  visit,  LOCF,  and 
treatment group. For the primary and coprimary variables, tables were generated for two samples: ITT 
(intent-to-treat  population)  and  PP  (per  protocol  population).  When  possible,  means  and  standard 
deviations were plotted against time and per treatment group (primary and coprimary). 
The two populations analysed for efficacy were defined as follows: 
Intent to Treat Population (ITT): Subjects who had taken at least one dose of study medication and 
who had baseline and any post-baseline efficacy data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method to account for dropouts. 
Valid-for-efficacy (VfE) population or Per Protocol Analysis (PP): All ITT subjects with the following 
additional criteria were included in PP analysis: 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 20/39 
 
 
 
 
• Subjects who received 12 weeks of randomized treatment provided they had no additional major 
protocol violations or if they did not prematurely discontinue the study due to lack of efficacy or due to 
drug-related adverse events. 
• Subjects who had no major protocol violations.  
In  both  studies,  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  ITT  population  and  repeated  for 
the  PP  population.  All  three  (co-)primary  efficacy  variables  were  required  to  simultaneously  show 
significance (p<0.05) so no adjustment to alpha level for multiple endpoints was necessary. 
Clinically  relevant  differences  between  10 mg  Levitra  ODT  and  placebo  were  predefined  for  power 
calculations.  A score difference of at least 5 points for the IIEF-EF domain and a percentage response 
difference  of  at  least  18%  for  the  diary  questions  in  the  general  population  were  used  for  clinical 
studies  on  vardenafil.    According  to  pooled  data  analyses,  improvement  of  ED  is  generally  smaller  in 
elderly  subjects  (≥65  years)  under  treatment  with  PDE5  inhibitors  compared  with  younger  subjects.  
Both studies 12093 and 12094 included 50% elderly subjects, however a score difference of at least 4 
points  for  the  IIEF-EF  domain  and  a  percentage  response  difference  of  at  least  15%  for  the  diary 
questions was assumed, which were interpreted as clinically relevant treatment differences.

Conduct of the study 
Study 12093 
Altogether 50 subjects (14% of all randomized patients) had protocol deviations during the study, 29 
subjects  (16%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  21  subjects  (11%)  in  the  vardenafil  group.  The  most 
commonly  reported  protocol  deviations  in  either  treatment  group  were  use  of  erectile  dysfunction 
treatment  within  7  days  of  the  selection  visit  (7%  of  the  placebo  subjects  and  4%  of  the  vardenafil 
subjects)  and  missing  follow-up  information  in  all  efficacy  parameters  (6%  of  the  placebo  group  and 
3% of the vardenafil group). 
Study 12094 
Altogether 44 subjects (13% of all randomized patients) had protocol deviations during the study; 21 
subjects  (13%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  23  subjects  (13%)  in  the  vardenafil  group.  The  most 
commonly  reported  protocol  deviations  in  either  treatment  group  were  also  missing  follow-up 
information in all efficacy parameters (8% of the subjects in each of the treatment groups) and the use 
of erectile dysfunction treatment within 7 days of the selection visit (2% of the subjects in each of the 
treatment groups). 
In  study  12093  a  total  of  11  subjects  (3.1%  of  the  safety  population)  received  a  sexually  enhancing 
drug after initiation of the study drug (5 subjects in the vardenafil group and 6 subjects in the placebo 
CHMP assessment report

group),  and  in  study  12094  a  total  of  8  subjects  (4  in  each  treatment  group;  2.4%  of  the  safety 
population). 
One patient (<65 years) in the placebo group in study 12093 and one more also in the placebo group 
in study 12094 used a vacuum pump after randomization. 
Treatment compliance 
The  number  of  doses  was  based  on  the  difference  between  dispensed  and  returned  tablets  or  the 
number of doses documented in the CRF. 
Study 12093 
The average number of doses per week overall for all safety population subjects in the vardenafil group 
was  2.8  tablets  per  week  compared  with  2.2  tablets  per  week  for  the  placebo  group  in  study  12093. 
Subjects < 65-years-of-age in the vardenafil took an average of 3.2 tablets per week overall compared 
with  2.1  tablets  per  week  for  the  placebo  group  indicating  that  the  vardenafil  subjects  made  more 
sexual attempts. Elderly subjects in the vardenafil and placebo groups took an average of 2.4 tablets 
per week overall. Similar trend were seen in the ITT and PP populations.  
Study 12094 
The average number of doses per week overall for all safety population subjects in the vardenafil group 
was  2.7  tablets  per  week  compared  with  1.8  tablets  per  week  for  the  placebo  group.  Subjects  <  65-
years-of-age  in  the  vardenafil  took  an  average  of  3.0  tablets  per  week  overall  compared  with  1.9 
tablets per week for the placebo group. Elderly subjects in the vardenafil group took an average of 2.3 
tablets per week overall compared with 1.7 tablets per week for the placebo group. Similar trend were 
seen in the ITT and PP populations 
Baseline data 
Major  baseline  demographic  and  clinical  characteristic  were  similar  for  each  group  of  treatment 
(placebo vs. vardenafil ODT) in both studies.

About two-thirds of the safety population were Caucasians, followed by about 22% Hispanic (Study 
12094 only) and 4% to 5% black or Asian subjects (see table below).  In study 12093, the ethnic 
origin of about 26% of the subjects was not determined due to country-specific reasons.

In South Africa, 18 subjects could not be categorized with regard to race (study 12093). 
In France, race was not allowed to be reported (study 12093). 
More than 78% of all patients were married. 
Altogether 234 subjects (65.4%) (study 12093) and 183 subjects (53.7%) (study 12094) in both age 
groups  reported  ‘light’  alcohol  consumption  and  200  subjects  (55.9%  of  all  subjects  in  the  safety 
population-  study  12093)  and  164  subjects  (48.7%-  study  12094)  were  past  or  present  smokers. 
However,  approximately  28%  (study  12093)  and  19%  (study  12094)  of  all  subjects  were  present 
smokers  who  continued  after  terminating  the  study  while  the  majority  of  smokers  (approximately 
72%-study 12093 and 81%- study 12094 ) already stopped smoking before the end of study. 
There were no apparent differences between the ITT and PP populations. 
Altogether  266  subjects  (74.3%  of  all  subjects  valid  for  safety)  of  study  12093  and  280  subjects 
(83.1%)  of  study  12094  had  experience  with  PDE-V inhibitors  such  as  sildenafil,  tadalafil,  or  the  test 
drug vardenafil. 
The ED symptom pattern reported for the total safety population was comparable in both age strata in 
both treatment groups for both studies. 
The  average  time  from  onset  of  ED  for  the  total  safety  population  was  about  6  to  7  years  in  both 
studies whereas the mean time since diagnosis of ED was about 4 to 5 years.  The majority of subjects 
in  both  studies  were  diagnosed  with  ED  with  organic  aetiology  (52.2%  and  65.0%  in  study  numbers 
12093  and  12094,  respectively).  The  severity  of  ED  symptoms  during  the  last  6  months  was 
comparable  between  both  studies  with  “Erection  is  not  maintained  during  intercourse”,  “Erection  too 
soft  to  penetrate  the  vagina“  and  “Inability  to  obtain  an  erection“  being  the  most  frequently  (≥75%) 
reported complaints.

Apart  from  erectile  dysfunction,  subjects  in  the  study  reported  further  concomitant  diseases  that  are 
frequently associated with ED. 
Vascular  hypertensive  disorders  were  the  most  frequently  reported  abnormalities  affecting  148 
subjects or 41.3% of all randomized subjects in the safety population-study 12093 and 142 subjects or 
42.1% -study 2094. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  subjects  ≥  65  years-of-age  had  a  higher  occurrence  of  hypertensive 
disorders  than  subjects  <  65  years-of-age.  Elderly  subjects  also  had  higher  frequencies  of 
gastrointestinal  atonic  and  hypomotility  disorders,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  had  higher 
frequencies  of  diabetes  hyperlipidaemia  and  (osteo)  arthropathies  than  the  younger  subjects  in  both 
treatment groups.

* Number of subjects which were excluded from either the safety, ITT or PP analysis 
The  number  of  subjects  excluded  from  the  efficacy  analyses  in  the  study  12093  was  a  total  of  51 
subjects and in study 12094 a total of 45 subjects, and the primary reason for exclusion was that the 
subjects  took  prohibited  medication/therapy  during  the  study  or  that  there  was  missing  follow-up 
information in all primary efficacy parameters.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
An  integrated  analysis  was  also  submitted;  data  for  both  studies  taken  together  showed  that  the 
treatment  group  differences  and  the  differences  between  ages  are  consistent  throughout  the  study 
from week 4 to week 12.   
Clinical studies in special populations 
Comparisons  of  results  in  subpopulations  were  done.  Sufficiently  sized  subgroups  were  ED  patients 
with and without diabetes/diabetic complications, dyslipidaemia or hypertension.  
All  analyses  (for  IIEF  Erectile  Function  Score,  SEP  2  and  SEP  3)  showed  a  nominally  significant 
superiority (p<0.0001) of Levitra ODT treatment when compared with placebo within stratum and any 
disease subgroup.  There were nominally significant differences between subgroups, always reflecting 
poorer  success  rates  in  the  elderly  or  in  the  subgroup  with  the  underlying  disease  compared  to  the 
CHMP assessment report

younger  or  the  subgroup  without  the  disease,  respectively.  Nevertheless,  there  were  no  significant 
‘stratum/subgroup*treatment’ interactions. 
Efficacy of the ODT treatment was shown less pronounced in diabetic patients than in the other disease 
subgroups assessed. 
Supportive study 
Not applicable. 
2.5.3  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two Phase III studies of identical design have been performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
the ODT formulation compared to placebo in patients with erectile dysfunction. 
In both studies, there was a 4-week run-in period without erectile dysfunction therapy (medication or 
devices).  During the 12-week treatment period, visits were planned on Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12. 
Forty-eight hours after the last dose of study medication was administered, a follow-up telephone call 
(or  personal  visit)  was  performed  to  obtain  information  about  the  possible  occurrence  of  serious 
adverse events (SAEs) or deaths. 
The efficacy of Levitra ODT was assessed using the same efficacy parameters that those already used 
in  studies  investigating  the  film  coated  tablets,  i.e.  IIEF-EF  Domain  score,  SEP  2  (success  rates  of 
penetration), and SEP 3 (success rates of maintenance of erection).  
Major  baseline  demographic  and  clinical  characteristic  were  similar  for  each  group  of  treatment 
(placebo vs. vardenfil ODT) in both studies. The average age of all safety subjects was about 62 years 
(for  both  studies).  This  is  due  to  the  increased  number  of  elderly  subjects  required  in  this  study  as 
maintained  by  the  forced  randomization  technique.  The  average  age  in  the  younger  patient  stratum 
was  about  53  years,  while  elderly  subjects  had  an  average  age  of  approximately  70  years.  The 
calculated age at entry in the study ranged from 21 to 84 years. 
These  results  showed  for  the  primary  efficacy  variables  in  both  studies  that  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT 
treatment was significantly superior to placebo with respect to change from baseline to Week 12/LOCF 
in  the  IIEF-EF  domain  and  in  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  12  overall  in  the  diary  item  SEP  2 
(penetration) success rate and the SEP 3 (maintenance of erection) success rate. 
Subjects <65 year-of-age achieved slightly higher scores on the IIEF-EF and had better success rates 
in the SEP 2 and SEP 3 than subjects ≥65 years-of-age. 
There  was  a  treatment-independent  statistically  significant  age  effect.  And  nominally  significant 
country-specific difference, due lower success rates in Australian centers.   
All  secondary  efficacy  measures  showed  significant  differences  in  favour  of  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT 
(diary  success  rates  reported  for  SEP  1,  SEP  4,  SEP  5,  SEP  6,  Treatment  Satisfaction  Scale  (TSS) 
domains,  higher  percentages  of  subjects  taking  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  reported  “back  to  normal 
erectile”  function,  higher  percentage  of  subjects  treated  with  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  responded 
positively  to  the  Global  Assessment  Question,  subjects  treated  with  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  needed  to 
initiate fewer sexual attempts until their first successful maintenance of erection).

2.5.4  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results obtained for the primary efficacy variables in both studies showed that  vardenafil 
10  mg  ODT  treatment  was  significantly  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  change  from  baseline  to 
Week 12/LOCF in the IIEF-EF domain and in the change from baseline to Week 12 overall in the diary 
item SEP 2 (penetration) success rate, and the SEP 3 (maintenance of erection) success rate. Also all 
secondary efficacy measures demonstrated nominally significant differences in favour of vardenafil 10 
mg  ODT  (diary  success  rates  reported  for  SEP  1,  SEP  4,  SEP  5,  SEP  6,  Treatment  Satisfaction  Scale 
(TSS) domains, higher percentages of subjects taking vardenafil 10 mg ODT reported “back to normal 
erectile”  function,  higher  percentage  of  subjects  treated  with  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  responded 
positively  to  the  Global  Assessment  Question  and  subjects  treated  to  initiate  fewer  sexual  attempts 
until their first successful maintenance of erection). 
The  clinical  efficacy  documentation  showed  that  the  ODT  was  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  all 
parameters assessed. These clinical results support the claimed indication. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
From  the  phase  III  studies  (12903  and  12094)  695  patients  made  up  the  safety  population,  343 
received  placebo  and  358  received  Levitra  10  mg ODT.   A  total  of  357  of  the  695  patients  were ≥65 
years of age (175 patients in the placebo group and 182 patients in the Levitra 10 mg ODT group).  
The  average  exposure  time  per  treatment  group  is 72  days  (placebo;  median:  78  days) and  76  days 
(vardenafil; median: 81 days). About 80% of all randomized subjects have been treated for up to 12 
weeks (84 days), 20% have been treated for more than 12 weeks.  
From the phase I studies, 52 patients made up the safety population. 
Adverse events  
The  most  frequently  adverse  events  observed  with  Levitra  ODT  in  the  submitted  clinical  trials  were 
headache,  followed  by  flushing,  nasal  congestion,  dyspepsia,  and  back  pain.  All  of  them  are  already 
covered in Levitra film coated tablets and were reported to be mild or moderate in intensity. 
In clinical studies phase III, 355 patients were treated with Levitra 10 mg ODT, 135 (38.0%) reported 
a treatment emergent AE, but only 86 (24.2%) patients had Adverse Events considered to be study-
drug-related. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In clinical studies phase III, the incidence of serious adverse events was low, with 5 (1.4%) patients in 
the  Levitra  ODT  group  and  2  (0.6%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  None  of  these  Serious  Adverse 
Events were considered to be related to Levitra 10 mg ODT treatment. 
In phase I studies there were two serious adverse events, none of them drug related according to the 
investigator (motorcycle accident and CK elevation after physical exercise). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no signs of drug associated changes in the Laboratory findings and vital signs did not show 
relevant differences between placebo and Levitra ODT.  
CHMP assessment report

Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  analysis  showed  higher  incidence  only  in  patients  with  history  of  hypertension  (patients 
without  hypertension  13.6%  versus  patients  with  hypertension  18.4%).    Specifically  dizziness  was 
seen  more  frequent  in  patients  on  Levitra  ODT  with  hypertension  (3.5%)  as  compared  to  patients 
without  hypertension  (1.4%).  Adverse  Events  by  age  were  similar  for  most  body  systems  except  for 
vascular  disorders  with  more  elderly  patients  reporting  Adverse  Events  (3%)  than  younger  patients 
(1%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions were not specifically studied with Levitra 10 mg ODT.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Ten adverse events in 5 subjects lead to discontinuation of vardenafil compared to 2 AE in 2 subjects 
leading to discontinuation of placebo. Each AE has been reported only once, except dizziness, which is 
reported twice with vardenafil. The other AE leading to discontinuation are: chest pain, acute coronary 
syndrome,  vision  blurred,  ALT  increased,  muscle  spasm,  flushing,  dysphagia  and  headache  with 
vardenafil, anxiety and deafness neurosensory with placebo. 
Of these discontinuations, particular attention has been provided to subject 14013-0009, who is a 39 
year  old  man  with  no  relevant  past  medical  history  that  discontinued  the  study  prematurely  due  to 
drug related  adverse  events (chest  pain and blurry vision). However, the day in which these adverse 
events  occurred,  the  subject  took  two  doses  of  study  treatment,  which  could  reasonably  explain  the 
AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  most  frequently  adverse  events  observed  with  Levitra  ODT  in  the  submitted  clinical  trials  were 
headache,  followed  by  flushing,  nasal  congestion,  dyspepsia,  and  back  pain.  All  of  them  are  already 
covered in Levitra film coated tablets and were reported to be mild or moderate in intensity. 
In clinical studies phase III, 355 patients were treated with Levitra 10 mg ODT, 135 (38.0%) reported

Important missing information 
Not applicable 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional 
risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
User consultation 
The applicant has submitted results from user testing of the package leaflet with target patient groups, 
which was performed in English. Overall, the user test is found acceptable. The results demonstrated a 
sufficient percentage of identification and comprehension of product related information. Therefore, the 
package leaflet was considered to be in line with the current readability requirements. 
2.8.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
The orodispersible tablet (ODT) disintegrates rapidly in the mouth in the presence of saliva and permits 
a  convenient  mode  of  intake  without  water.  It  could  benefit  patients  that  have  difficulty  swallowing 
tablets or that would prefer a more discreet mode of administration. 
A  direct  comparison  between  Levitra  10  mg  ODT  and  Levitra  10  mg  film-coated  tablets  would  have 
been  desirable  in  order  to  assure  that  no  additional  beneficial  effect  is  expected  with  this  new 
formulation. 
Risks 
PK  studies  show  that  Levitra  ODT  is  suprabioavailable  when  compared  to  Levitra  film  coated  tablets. 
Therefore,  Levitra10  mg  orodispersable  tablet  is  not  bioequivalent  to  Levitra  film-coated  tablet.  The 
maximum  dose  for  Levitra  film  coated  tablet  is  20  mg,  but  this  cannot  be  substitute  for  two  Levitra 
10 mg ODT tablets. 
There is a safety concern if the orodispersible tablet is taken with water, as PK studies showed a 10% 
increase  in  Cmax  in  these  cases.  The  SPC  has  been  amended  to  highlight  that  Levitra  10 mg  ODT 
tablet  must  not  be  taken  with  water  and  that  the  maximum  dose  to  be  administered  is  one  10  mg 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 38/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
orodispersible  tablet  in  order  to  avoid  the  most  risky  situation,  i.e.,  swallowing  two  orodispersible 
tablets with water. 
For this new formulation there are no new unfavourable effects added to the already known for Levitra 
film coated tablets. As commented before, a direct comparison between Levitra 10 mg ODT and Levitra 
10 mg film-coated tablets would have been desirable in order to assure that no unfavourable effect is 
expected with this new formulation. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Although a direct comparison between Levitra 10 mg ODT and Levitra 10 mg film- coated tablets would 
have  been  desirable,  the  information  provided  with  the  submitted  study  is  considered  acceptable  as 
this  new  formulation  achieves  the  characteristic  flat  dose  response  curved  linked  to  this  active 
substance. 
The  submitted  documentation  showed  that  its  pharmacokinetic  profile  is  inside  the  safety/efficacy 
window already studied for Levitra film coated tablet. This was confirmed with Phase III studies were 
Levitra  10 mg  ODT  was  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  all  parameters  assessed  and  safety  data 
indicate  that  the  safety  profile  is  in  line  with  that  already  known  for  Levitra  film  coated  tablets 
formulation and the information is already included in the current SPC. 
The  overall  B/R  of  Levitra  10  mg  orodispersable  tablets  is  positive  provided  that  the  modifications  of 
the SPC are taken into account. 
2.8.1.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
• 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
•  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Levitra in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. 
Erectile  dysfunction  is  the  inability  to  achieve  or  maintain  a  penile  erection  sufficient  for  satisfactory 
sexual  performance  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation.

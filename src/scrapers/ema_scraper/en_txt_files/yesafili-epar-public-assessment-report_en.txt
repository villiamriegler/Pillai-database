2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Yesafili (MYL-1701P; M710) has been developed as a biosimilar to Eylea (aflibercept). which was 
authorized via the Centralised Procedure in the European Union on 22-11-2012 (marketing 
authorization holder Bayer AG). Aflibercept is classified under the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) classification system as an ocular antineovascularisation agent (ATC code: S01LA05). 
Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for 
intravitreal administration. 
In Eylea, the active pharmacologic agent, aflibercept, acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds to 
VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby inhibits the binding and activation of their cognate receptors VEGFR-1 
and VEGFR-2, which are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Activation through VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2 is associated with neovascularization and vascular permeability, while inhibition of activation 
by Eylea (aflibercept) has been demonstrated to reduce both processes, with clinical benefit in the 
indicated disorders. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 10/104 
 
 
 
 
The claimed therapeutic indications are: 
Yesafili is indicated for adults for the treatment of 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or 
central RVO) (see section 5.1), 
• 
• 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) (see section 5.1). 
The Applicant claims all approved indications of Eylea in the adults for the biosimilar product MYL-
1701P (M710). 
The indication for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants – granted to 
Eylea - is not claimed at the time of the submission. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Yesafili  has  been  developed  as  biosimilar  to  Eylea  (EMEA/H/C/002392)  for  intravitreal  injection.  The 
finished  product  is  presented  as  solution  for  injection  in  a  vial  containing  40  mg/mL  of  aflibercept  as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 20 (E 432), trehalose 
dihydrate and water for injections.  
The product is available in a vial (type I glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber), under 2 different 
pack sizes: pack size containing 1 vial and a 5-micron (18 G ×1½-inch) filter needle and pack size of 1 
vial, a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18 G ×1½-inch), a 1 mL Luer-lock syringe and an injection needle 
(30 G ×½-inch), respectively. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The  active  substance  (INN:  aflibercept;  company  code  MYL-1701P  or  M710)  is  a  recombinant  fusion 
protein  consisting  of  human  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  receptor-1  (VEGFR-1)  and 
receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
and  is  produced  in  recombinant  Chinese Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cells.  The  homodimeric  fusion  protein 
consists of 431 amino acids in each chain and has a molecular mass of 115 kilodaltons (kDa) of which 
approximately 15% is carbohydrate; the non-glycosylated mass is 97 kDa. There are five N-glycosylation 
sites on each chain at asparagine-36, asparagine-68, asparagine-123, asparagine-196 and asparagine-
282.  
The amino acid sequence of aflibercept is shown in Figure 1. Aflibercept selectively binds both human 
vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  A  (VEGF-A)  and  placental  growth  factor  (PlGF).  By  preventing 
interaction  with  their  cognate  receptors,  aflibercept  reduces  pathological  angiogenesis  and  prevents 
vascular leakage.

The general information on the active substance is considered sufficient. 
Figure 1. Amino acid sequence of aflibercept 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The active substance is manufactured, tested and released at facilities that operate in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured using a fermentation process in a production bioreactor.  
The upstream process starts with thawing of a single vial of the working cell bank (WCB). After thawing, 
cells  are  expanded  under  controlled  conditions  which  includes  serial  sub-cultivations  in  shake  flasks, 
followed  by  seed  bioreactors  and  eventually  production  bioreactor.  Upon  transfer  into  the  production 
bioreactor, cells are finally expanded and maintained under defined conditions prior to harvesting of the 
culture supernatant. 
The purification process of the active substance comprises of a combination of chromatography steps,, 
followed by intermediate depth filtration and ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF). Dedicated, orthogonal 
virus clearance steps, are integrated into the purification process. Prior to filtration through a 0.2 µm 
filter  into  the  active  substance  container  closure  system  (CCS),  trehalose  dihydrate,  polysorbate  20 
(PS20), and histidine−HCl are added to target the final concentration of formulation buffer and to adjust 
the target protein concentration.  
The Applicant provided a detailed description of the manufacturing process steps that is accompanied by 
flow charts and tables listing process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) with their classification 
and acceptable ranges/acceptance criteria/action limits. There are no critical intermediates defined for 
the active substance manufacturing process. No reprocessing has been claimed by the Applicant. 
Sufficient details on the materials, dimensions and technical drawings for the CCS have been included in 
the dossier.  
Overall,  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described.  Information  on 
Critical Process Parameter (CPP), Key Process Parameters (KPP), Critical Performance Attributes (CPA) 
and Key Performance Attributes (KPA) is included and considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.

030 is satisfactory. A two-tiered cell bank system with MCB and WCB has been established in accordance 
with cGMP. The cell banking system is adequately described with sufficient details on manufacture and 
storage of the MCB and WCB. The cell bank specifications are acceptable. A concise description of the 
manufacture and qualification acceptance criteria of new WCBs is available. Stability of the cell banks is 
monitored by periodic determination of viability and, by taking into account the available stability data 
for the WCB, the proposed intervals are acceptable.  
The proposed limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) is considered acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A  comprehensive  overview  of  critical  in-process  controls  and  critical  in-process  tests  performed 
throughout  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  is  given.  Acceptable  information  has  been 
provided  on  the  control  system  in  place  to  monitor  and  control  the  active  substance  manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. The 
analytical methods used for in-process testing are adequately described and their suitability has been 
demonstrated.  Actions  taken  if  limits  are  exceeded  are  specified.  The  IPCs  and  their  acceptance 
criteria/action limits are considered adequate.  
Hold  times  are  defined  for  several  steps  of  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  and  are 
adequately justified by data from laboratory and commercial scale studies.  
Process validation 
A  traditional  approach  was  chosen  to  verify  process  performance  at  commercial  scale.  Prospective 
process  verification  encompassed  manufacture  of  a  sufficient  number  of  consecutive  process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batches at commercial scale at the intended commercial manufacturing 
site according to the intended commercial process.  
The acceptance criteria, action limits and expected ranges for performance attributes were defined using 
existing  process  knowledge,  development  and  manufacturing  experience,  risk  ranking  and  filtering, 
process failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and process characterisation (PC) studies comprising 
of  univariate  and  multivariate  design  of  experiment  (DOE)  studies  etc.,  in  order  to  develop  a  control 
strategy  as  outlined  in  ICH  Q11  and  EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014.  The  presented  approach  is 
acceptable and the classification of process parameters (PPs) and their specified ranges/limits based on 
their impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance and/or process performance 
appear reasonable. 
In  summary,  the  presented  process  verification  data  demonstrate  that  the  intended  commercial 
manufacturing process performs consistently and delivers active substance complying with the release 
specifications under commercial operating conditions.  
Assessment report

The  proposed  hold  times  are  sufficiently  validated  under  consideration  of  physicochemical  and 
microbiological hold time data. Resin lifetimes and potential carry-over, and re-usability of the UF/DF 
membrane have been investigated.  
The Applicant performed a stepwise, two-tiered extractables/leachables risk assessment. Based on the 
outcome  of  the  assessment,  the  risk  for  presence  of  extractables/leachables  arising  from  the  active 
substance  manufacturing  process  is  low  and  potential  extractable/leachables  pose  no  risk  to  patient 
safety. 
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process is adequately validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The  production  clone  and  active  substance  manufacturing  process  were  initially  developed  using 
laboratory  scale  bioreactors  and  chromatography  systems  considering  the  ranges  established  with 
reference product lots. Thereafter, the process was scaled-up to the pilot scale and then transferred to 
the  commercial  active  substance  manufacturing  site  and  scaled-up  once  more  to  the  proposed 
commercial scale.  
Information on the commercial scale manufacturing process development has been provided together 
with  a  comparability  assessment  using  orthogonal  state-of-the-art  analytical  procedures.  Taking  into 
account that the straightforward finished product manufacturing process has no/very limited impact on 
the vast majority of the quality attributes and that the comprehensive analytical comparability exercise 
presented  in  3.2.R.  support  comparability  between  the  finished  product  batches  manufactured  using 
both active substance scales manufactured from pre-change and post-change process, it can be agreed 
that the active substance produced using the pre-change and post-change process are comparable. 
Characterisation 
The  Applicant  characterised  physicochemical  and  biological  properties  of  MYL-1701P  active  substance 
using  orthogonal,  state-of-the  art  analytical  methods,  revealing  that  the  active  substance  has  the 
expected structure. Method descriptions and qualification reports are provided for the characterisation 
methods.  
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The release specification for the MYL-1701P active substance includes tests for general attributes (colour, 
clarity,  pH,  osmolality),  identity,  quantity,  purity  and  impurities,  potency,  process-related  impurities, 
polysorbate 20 and microbiological safety (bacterial endotoxins and bioburden).  
Analytical methods 
The general and microbial attributes are tested according to the respective Ph. Eur. monographs. The 
compendial methods have been verified to demonstrate the suitability for the intended purpose. All other 
attributes  are  tested  using  in-house  analytical  methods.  Method  descriptions  for  all  non-compendial 
analytical procedures are provided and validations are performed according to ICH Q2(R1).  
Batch analysis 
Batch  analyses  data  are  presented  for  active  substance  batches.  In  summary,  the  presented  results 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process reliably delivers active substance with consistent quality. 
Reference standards 
The history of the primary reference standards (PRS) used throughout development of MYL-1701P active 
substance is adequately described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 14/104 
 
 
 
The Applicant intends to implement a two-tiered reference standard system, with primary and secondary 
reference  standards  (SRS).  A  new  PRS  will  be  qualified  and  annually  re-qualified  against  the  existing 
PRS, using the same testing programme as for the current PRS. The SRSs will be manufactured from 
commercial active substance batches and qualified/annually re-qualified against the PRS. The Applicant’s 
proposal for initial qualification and re-qualification of the new PRS and SRSs is acceptable.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
The Applicant provided stability data. Data are available for storage at long-term storage conditions and 
accelerated conditions. Forced degradation studies including heat, high/low pH, oxidation and light stress 
were conducted using MYL-1701P active substance and finished product, which has the same composition 
as the active substance. 
The  design  of  the  stability  studies  is  mainly  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5C.  The  samples  are  stored  in 
containers that are representative for the commercial CCS. 
In conclusion, the presented data support the proposed active substance shelf-life when stored in the 
defined CCS.  
Commitments to complete the currently ongoing stability studies and to perform post-approval annual 
stability studies are provided. The proposed protocol (including adequate handling of any confirmed OOS) 
is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
MYL-1701P  finished  product  is  a  sterile  solution  for  injection  intended  for  intravitreal  administration 
supplied in a single-use vial. The finished product is formulated at a target concentration of 40 mg/mL 
of active substance in histidine, trehalose dihydrate, polysorbate 20. 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin, or novel excipients used for formulation of MYL-1701P 
finished  product.  All  excipients  are  of  Ph.  Eur.  compendial  grade  and  are  commonly  used  in  other 
commercially available intravitreal biological products, at similar concentrations. There are no overages 
applied for MYL-1701P finished product. Compatibility between the excipients and the active substance 
is considered demonstrated by the long-term stability data. 
The choice of the CCS has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
MYL-1701P is available in packs containing 1 vial and a 5-micron (18 G ×1½-inch) filter needle and packs 
containing  1  vial,  a  5-micron  sterile  filter  needle  (18 G  ×1½-inch),  a  1 mL  Luer-lock  syringe  and  an 
injection needle (30 G ×½-inch). All device components are CE-marked.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacture,  control,  packaging  and  release  of  MYL-1701P  finished  product  is  performed,  in 
accordance with GMP. 
MYL-1701P finished product manufacturing process is performed by a standard aseptic filling process for 
sterile  injectable  preparations  commonly  used  in  production  of  biotechnological  pharmaceuticals.  It 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023

includes  thawing  of  the  active  substance,  pooling  and  mixing,  bioburden  filtration,  sterile  filtration, 
aseptic filling and stoppering, capping and visual inspection.  
The  manufacturing  process  development  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail.  Appropriate  critical 
process steps and IPCs are described in the dossier. The defined set of process parameters have been 
shown to be suitable for monitoring the manufacturing process. In addition, ranges and values chosen 
for the processing parameters are acceptable and support the commercial manufacture of the product. 
Hold times are sufficiently justified. 
Finished  product  manufacturing  process  validation  was  performed  following  a  classical  validation 
approach and covered all finished product manufacturing steps.  
Data  supporting  shipment  of  the  finished  product  from  the  manufacturing  site  to  the  distribution  site 
have been provided and are considered acceptable.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The list of finished product specification includes controls of identity, purity, impurities, sterility and other 
general tests.  
In  summary,  the  selection  of  specification  attributes  and  setting  of  the  acceptance  criteria  are in  line 
with ICH Q6B and are found adequate to control the quality of the MYL-1701P finished product. 
The Applicant provided a risk assessment as per ICH Q3D guidance for the potential elemental impurities. 
No potential sources of Class 1, 2, or 3 elemental impurities as defined by ICH Q3D were identified and 
none of these elements are intentionally added during the process. In addition, a risk-based assessment 
was completed to determine the organic extractables and leachables present in the components of the 
manufacturing  train.  The  conclusion  that  potential  leachables  arising  from  the  manufacturing  process 
and present in the finished product pose no risk to patient safety is found sufficiently addressed and no 
additional controls are necessary.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted  that  no  risk  was  identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control  measures  are  deemed 
necessary. 
Analytical methods 
The finished product is tested using both compendial and non-compendial methods. Many of the methods 
used to test the finished product are equivalent to the methods used to test the active substance. The 
analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data have been provided . Results complied with pre-defined acceptance criteria for all 
batches. Furthermore, the provided batch data confirm consistency of the finished product manufacturing 
process.  
Reference materials

The reference standard is the same as that used for testing of the active substance. Reference is made 
to the corresponding active substance section. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed finished product shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 2°C to 8°C is sufficiently justified 
based on long-term stability. This is considered adequately justified. 
All stability studies have been conducted according to ICH guidelines. The container closure system used 
for  the  stability  studies  is  the  same  as  that  used  during  routine  manufacture  and  as  intended  for 
marketing.  
In  conclusion,  the  stability  data  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  is  stable  at  the  recommended 
long-term storage condition of 2°C to 8°C and stored in the original package in order to protect from 
light, as mentioned in the SmPC, supporting the proposed shelf-life of 36 months.  
Adequate  post-approval  stability  protocol  information  is  presented  and  acceptable  handling  of  any 
confirmed OOS is proposed. Furthermore, as part of the post-approval stability commitment, one finished 
product  batch  per  year  will  be  subjected  to  stability  testing  and  evaluation  for  continuous  stability 
monitoring. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Multiple  complementing  measures  are  implemented to  ensure  product  safety with  regard  to  non-viral 
and  viral  adventitious  agents.  The  measures  include  selection  and  testing of  materials,  testing  of  cell 
banks and process intermediates for microbial and viral contaminants, testing of microbial attributes as 
in-process controls and at release, implementation and validation of dedicated virus clearance steps and 
steps  contributing  to  virus  reduction.  In  addition,  microbial  quality  is  ensured  by  process  design 
(microbial reduction filtrations, sterile filtration, aseptic processing) and sanitisation procedures. 
In summary, the risk of potential contamination and transmission of bacterial, fungal, viral or TSE agents 
appears acceptably low. 
2.2.3.6.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.2.3.7.  Biosimilarity 
Analytical similarity of MYL-1701P finished product was assessed in a comprehensive analytical similarity 
exercise using EU-sourced Eylea as reference medicinal product (RMP). The pivotal clinical Phase 3 study 
MYL-1701P-3001 was conducted with US-sourced Eylea and thus, the Applicant performed a three-way 
analytical  similarity  assessment  between  MYL-1701P,  EU-Eylea  and  US-Eylea.  The  approach  and 
methodology of the analytical similarity and comparability assessments are sufficiently described. Both 
comparability  and  similarity  assessment  are  well  presented  in  the  dossier.  Tables  and  figures 
summarising the individual results and data distribution for each parameter, chromatographs, spectra, 
dose-response curves etc. have been included.  
Quality attributes of aflibercept were ranked (low, moderate, high and very high risk) based on a risk 
assessment  that  took  into  account  potential  impacts  on  clinical  performance  (i.e.  efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics,  safety  and  immunogenicity)  and  the  degree  of  uncertainty.  A 
Assessment report

summary of the criticality assignment with brief justifications for risk ranking has been provided and, in 
the main, the outcome of the risk assignment appears reasonable. 
The Applicant used a statistical approach to evaluate comparability of MYL-1701P finished product from 
pilot  and  commercial  scale  and  similarity  of  MYL-1701P  and  EU/US-Eylea.  Under  consideration  of  the 
criticality of the attribute and statistical amenability, orthogonality and sensitivity of the corresponding 
analytical method, attributes were either evaluated against a quality range. The Applicant’s approach to 
evaluate  comparability  and  similarity  is  not  fully  endorsed.  While,  in  the  main,  the  selection  of  the 
evaluation approach (quality range vs. qualitative assessment) appears sufficiently justified, for several 
attributes the Applicant’s justification cannot be followed. However, taking into account that the Applicant 
provided  graphical  and/or  tabular  presentations  of  individual  analytical  results,  as  well  as  descriptive 
statistics,  which  enabled  an  assessment  independent  of  the  defined  quality  ranges,  no  concerns  are 
raised with respect to statistical data evaluation.  
The selected comprehensive set of orthogonal state-of-the–art analytical methods, which covers primary 
and higher order structure, size, glycoform and charge variants, post-translational modifications, protein 
concentration, as well as multiple biological functions mediated by the VEGF receptor domains or the Fc 
portion,  appears  adequate  to  address  the  relevant  quality  attributes  of  aflibercept.  Overall,  the 
descriptions  and  qualification  data  that  have  been  provided  for  the  analytical  methods  used  for  the 
analytical comparability exercise are considered sufficient to conclude that the analytical methods are 
suitable  and  sensitive  to  detect  minor  differences.  The  results  show  that,  for  many  quality  attributes 
(including  multiple  attributes  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action),  MYL-1701P  finished  product  was 
demonstrated  to  be  analytically  highly  similar  to  Eylea  EU.  In  the  main,  the  observed  differences  are 
adequately  addressed  by  the  Applicant  and  are  not  expected  to  impact  clinical  performance  of  the 
product.  In  addition,  analytical  comparability  of  US-Eylea  to  EU-Eylea  has  been  sufficiently 
demonstrated. A summary of the analytical similarity assessment between MYL-1701P finished product 
and EU/US-Eylea is provided in Table 1.

2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. A comprehensive analytical 
biosimilarity exercise was conducted and demonstrated that, from a quality perspective, MYL-1701P was 
shown  to  be  highly  similar  to  the  EU  reference  medicinal  product  (Eylea).  Any  observed  analytical 
differences  have  been  adequately  justified  and  are  not  expected  have  a  relevant  impact  on  clinical 
performance of the product. 
The  Applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  active  substance  and/or  finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing 
process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
One  Major  Objection  was  raised  during  the  assessment  due  to  the  insufficient  information  regarding 
process characterisation studies and small-scale models and their qualification used for the purification 
process, which has been adequately addressed by the end of the procedure. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to the request for implementation of a qualitative control 
of the glycan profile at release of the active substance to ensure batch-to-batch consistency of the glycan 
profile before the first commercial scale batch is released (Recommendation 1). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  A qualitative control of the glycan profile at release of the active substance should be implemented 
to ensure batch-to-batch consistency of the glycan profile before the first commercial scale batch is 
released. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive battery of in vitro pharmacodynamics characterization studies was performed in a 
side-by-side comparative manner to evaluate the key biological activities of MYL-1701P drug product 
(DP), EU-, US- and JP-Eylea. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No  in  vivo  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  performed  under  the  assumption  that  the  biosimilar 
comparability exercise for the physicochemical and biological characteristics and the non-clinical in vitro 
studies  are  considered  satisfactory.  This  approach  is  in  line  with  the  guideline  on  similar  biological 
medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and 
clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
As  VEGF-A165  is  the  primary  VEGF-A  isoform  responsible  for  VEGF-mediated  biological  activity,  the 
binding  activity  of  MYL-1701P  and  its  comparators  (Eylea  sourced  from  EU,  US,  and  Japan)  were 
characterized  by  both  enzyme-linked  immune-sorbent  assay  (ELISA)  and  surface  plasmon  resonance 
(SPR)-based binding kinetic method. These assays were performed as well for VEGF-A isoforms VEGF-
A121  and  VEGF-A189,  whereas  for  VEGF-A110  and  VEGF-A206,  only  the  ELISA-based  method  was  used. 
Binding affinity of MYL-1701P to VEGF-A165, A189, A110 and A206 was highly similar compared to all Eylea 
products, only two out of the seven MYL-1701P lots were outside the lower limit of quality range of US-
Eylea in VEGF-A121 binding (see section 2.3.6 on an assessment on this). SPR binding kinetics and affinity 
data of MYL-1701P to VEGF-A165 fit within the quality range of all three comparators. No or only slight 
or  marginal  differences  for  values  of  association  (ka),  dissociation  (kd)  rate  constants  and  equilibrium 
dissociation constants (KD) were detected for MYL-1701P binding to VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A189 isoforms. 
VEGF-B  isoforms  VEGF-B167  and  VEGF-B186  play  a  partial  role  in  angiogenesis.  According  to  literature 
VEGF-B167  is  the  predominant  isoform  expressed  in  animal  eyes  and  under  the  assumption  that 
comparable angiogenic activity has been demonstrated, VEGF-B167 was selected as the binding target to 
identify  any  differences  in  VEGF-B-related  biological  activity  between  MYL-1701P  and  Eylea.  Marginal 
differences in VEGF-B167 binding between MYL-1701P and its three comparators, Eylea sourced from EU, 
US  and  Japan,  were  observed  but  considered  to  be  related  to  assay  variability  and  accounted  to  an 
invariably limited number of lots tested. 
As aflibercept is a fusion protein with the binding domains for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, but not VEGFR-3, 
it was expected to have no binding affinity with VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which bind primarily to VEGFR-3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 22/104 
 
 
 
Binding of VEGF-C and VEGF-D was assessed by a negative ELISA assay and the “no binding activity” 
was confirmed for MYL-1701P DP and for the Eylea reference products.  
An SPR-based comparative assessment of binding kinetics to galectin-1, an angiogenic factor associated 
with proliferative diabetic retinopathy through VEGFR-2 signalling, was performed. The relative binding 
of Galectin-1 to MYL-1701P was within the quality range of the EU reference product though a slightly 
lower binding affinity was observed for MYL-1701P when compared to Eylea from US and Japan.  
The  primary  mechanism  of  action  for  aflibercept-associated  pharmacological  activity,  the  relative 
inhibitory  activity  of  MYL-1701P  against  VEGF-A165  binding  to  VEGFR-1  and  VEGFR-2,  was  compared 
side-by-side with Eylea reference products using an electrochemiluminescent competitive ELISA-based 
method. Two out of five MYL-1701P GMP lots were above the upper quality range of Eylea products for 
the inhibition of VEGFR-2  binding (see section 2.3.6 for discussion). In regard to VEGFR-1 binding all 
lots of MYL-1701P stayed within the quality range of EU- and US-Eylea.  
Placental growth factor (PlGF) consists of 4 major splice isoforms, PlGF-1, PlGF-2, PlGF-3, and PlGF-4, 
which  are  angiogenic  factors  known  to  bind  to  VEGFR-1,  but  not  VEGFR-2.  Furthermore,  PlGF-1  and 
PlGF-3 are non-heparin binding diffusible isoforms while PlGF-2 and -4 have additional heparin binding 
domains (Del Falco 2012). Because PlGF-2 showed to have a more robust binding affinity to aflibercept 
(~10-fold) when compared with PlGF-1 (Eylea SBA 2011), PlGF-2 was used to investigate the potential 
of MYL-1701P to inhibit PlGF binding to VEGFR-1. An electrochemiluminescent competitive binding assay 
(ELISA) to determine the % relative of activity of PlGF-2 binding to VEGFR-1 in the presence of (multiple 
concentrations of) MYL-1701P was performed. High similarity between MYL-1701P and its comparators 
was observed, with only one lot of MYL-1701P above the quality range of its EU reference product (see 
section 2.3.6 for an assessment on this). 
Binding  of  VEGF  to  the  VEGFR-2  leads  to  dimerization  of  the  receptor,  leading  to  VEGF-mediated 
biological activity. Inhibition of VEGF-A165 induced KDR dimerization, as well as functional inhibition of 
VEGF-165 induced HUVEC proliferation, a main step in angiogenesis was comparatively assessed for MYL-
1701P  and  Eylea  sourced  from  EU,  US  and  Japan.  Neither  differences  between  any  Aflibercepts  were 
detected  in  the  HUVEC  proliferation  assay,  nor  for  MYL-1701P  and  EU  Eylea  in  the  KDR  dimerization 
assay. The latter method showing some differences between MYL-1701P and Eylea from US and Japan 
but considered due to method variability. Please also see section 2.3.6.  
No preclinical in vivo pharmacodynamics studies were conducted. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A  series  of  secondary  pharmacodynamic  assays  were  designed  to  investigate  the  MYL-1701P  binding 
activity to the Fc receptors (including FcγR1, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb, FcRn, and C1q). For 
each Fc receptor, a SPR-based assay was performed on a Biacore instrument platform to determine the 
absolute equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) (calculated for FcγRIIa R131, FcγRIIa H131, FcγRIIb and 
FcγRIIIb)  or  relative  binding  activity  (for  FcγRIa,  FcγRIIIa  V158,  and  FcRn)  of  MYL-1701P  or  Eylea 
reference products to a common reference standard.  
FcγR functions either as activating receptor (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIII) or inhibitory receptor (FcγRIIb), to 
elicit  or  inhibit  immune  functions.  Aflibercept’s  mechanism  of  action  is  not  known  to  involve  Fcγ 
receptors,  nevertheless  the  binding  to  these  receptors  was  investigated  for  a  complete  similarity 
assessment.  A  similar  binding  affinity  was  observed  for  FcyRI  and  FcyRIIa  R131/H131  (with  Kd  values 
slightly  above  the  reference  products  for  R131),  whereas  binding  affinities  to  FcγRIIb,  FcγRIIIa  and 
FcγRIIIb  were  found  to  be  slightly  lower  for  MYL-1701P,  likely  to  be  related  to  the  slightly  higher 
Assessment report

fucosylation percentage in the Fc region of MYL-1701P and not considered to be clinically meaningful due 
to Aflibercept’s lack of effector function associated with FcyR binding.  
The FcRn receptor is known to play an important role in antibody pharmacokinetics. The relative binding 
affinity  to  FcRn  of  MYL-1701P  was  well  within  the  quality  range  of  its  EU  reference  product,  showing 
some minor differences compared to US and JP sourced Eylea.  
A  direct  ELISA  assay  was  performed  to  comparatively  assess  the  relative  binding  activity  of  C1q,  a 
complement  protein  involved  in  CDC,  to  MYL-1701P,  EU-,  US-,  and  JP-Eylea.  High  similarity  was 
observed for MYL-1701P compared to its reference products.  
In  addition,  effector  functions  related  to  FcγR  and  C1q  binding,  such  as  antibody  dependent  cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) were also compared between MYL-
1701P  and  Eylea.  As  expected,  significant  ADCC  and  CDC  activities  were  only  observed  in  the 
corresponding positive controls, no ADCC or CDC activity was detected for MYL-1701P and Eylea sourced 
from EU, US and Japan.  
No preclinical in vivo secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted.   
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No non-clinical safety pharmacology studies were conducted. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No separate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, or PK drug interaction studies were 
conducted for MYL-1701P. A comparative single dose PK study was performed due to expectations 
from regulatory bodies competent for non-European regions. This study demonstrated high similarity 
in both systemic and ocular disposition of MYL-1701P and JP-Eylea following a single IVT injection in 
male Dutch Belted rabbits. 
Anyway, as stated in the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues” [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010]: If the comparability 
exercise in the in vitro studies is considered satisfactory and no factors of concern are identified, or 
these factors of concern do not block direct entrance into humans, an in vivo animal study may not be 
considered necessary. The similarity between the originator and the biosimilar product is in the first 
place assessed with quality testing and in vitro data. In contrast to the in vitro methods, in vivo studies 
in animals are not considered informative for the similarity/comparability exercise. These models are 
considered highly variable and are actually also too insensitive. This conclusion concerns both 
pharmacokinetic comparisons and comparisons on safety.  
Based on these considerations, these comparative studies in animal models have been discouraged. 
Data on ADA from animals are not predictive for the clinical situation, and comparative data on ADA 
are of uncertain relevance. Potential differences in immunogenicity between Aflibercept Viatris and 
Eylea need however to be evaluated in the clinical setup. Therefore, these in vivo studies can at most 
be considered supportive, but not as evidence of true similarity.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant did not conduct non-clinical toxicology studies with MYL-1701P. Indeed, a complete 
package of similarity data were collected in a sensitive and comprehensive battery of in vitro studies 
(please also refer to the quality section), demonstrating a low risk of potential differences in non-
clinical efficacy, PK, and non-immunogenicity-related general toxicity between MYL-1701P and Eylea 
reference product. It is a known fact that in vivo studies are less sensitive compared to in vitro 
biological assays in the identification of potential differences between products, and thereby also 
between MYL-1701P and Eylea. Another obvious reason for not conducting toxicity studies with MYL-
1701P was the access to the Cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies performed with the Eylea aflibercept 
(Eylea EPAR 2012, Eylea SBA 2011). Only minimal systemic or local toxicities were observed after 
intravitreal injection of 4 mg/eye of the comparator Eylea aflibercept to the monkeys, for up to 8 
months.  
According to the EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1 guidelines, studies regarding toxicology 
(including developmental and reproductive toxicity studies), are not required for non-clinical testing of 
biosimilars. Furthermore, studies regarding safety pharmacology, carcinogenicity and local tolerance 
are likewise not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. 
As such, the Applicant’s approach is considered appropriate. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
ln accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the evaluation of the potential 
environmental risks posed by medicinal products should be submitted, their environmental impact 
should be assessed and, on a case-by-case basis, specific arrangements to limit the impact should be 
considered (Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal product for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
Further it is stated, that “In the case of products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, 
peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should be 
provided. This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their 
nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.” 
The Applicant provided a valid justification (as per Guideline above) for the absence of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment, which is deemed acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic 
In  vitro  pharmacodynamic  characterization  studies  were  performed  in  a  side-by-side  comparative 
manner to match the key biological activities of MYL-1701P drug product with its referenced medicinal 
product (RMP) Eylea sourced from EU, US and Japan. Primary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted 
to evaluate concentration-activity relationships and included the following assays: binding to the VEGFR-
1  and  -2  target  ligands  (VEGF-A110,  VEGF-A121,  VEGF-A165,  VEGF-A189,  VEGF-A206,  VEGF-B167, 
VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and Galectin-1), inhibition of VEGF-A165-binding to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, inhibition 
of VEGF-A165-induced VEGFR-2 dimerization, inhibition of PlGF-2 binding with VEGFR-1, and functional 
inhibition  of  VEGF  induced  proliferation  of  human  umbilical  vein  endothelial  cells  (HUVEC).  Although 
Aflibercept’s  mechanism  of  action  is  not  known  to  involve  Fcγ  receptors,  a  comprehensive  battery  of 
secondary pharmacodynamic assays was performed, including binding activity of MYL-1701P to the Fc 
receptors as follows: FcγR1, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb, FcRn, and C1q. Additionally, antibody

dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays were also 
included as part of the similarity exercise. 
No  in  vivo  animal  studies  were  conducted  in  addition  to  the  analytical  biosimilarity  assessment, 
investigating analytical, physiochemical and functional similarity between MYL-1701P and its RMP Eylea, 
sourced from EU , US and Japan. This is accepted because, as outlined in the EMA Guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1; 2014) and the EMA Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and 
clinical  issues  (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005  Rev  1),  a  stepwise  approach  is  recommended  for 
evaluation of the biosimilarity of drug product (DP) and the EU-licenced referenced medicinal product 
(RMP). In vitro assays are considered as paramount for the non-clinical biosimilar comparability exercise 
since they are considered more specific and sensitive in detecting differences between the biosimilar and 
the RMP. 
No concerns are raised from the pharmacology point of perspective. Please follow the Quality 
Assessment report regarding the comparability assessment.  
Pharmacokinetics 
"A comparative single dose PK study was performed due to expectations from regulatory bodies 
competent for non-European regions. No other pharmacokinetics studies were conducted with MYL 
1701P. 
It is acknowledged, that the in vivo studies were conducted due to expectations from regulatory bodies 
competent for non-European regions. Generally, the European guidance on biosimilar development 
provides sufficient flexibility to acknowledge aspects of a globalized development program. Though not 
requested, results of these in vivo testings are accepted and are in support of the MAA of Aflibercept 
Viatris. Ultimately, clinical data supersede and should address any potential PK and immunogenicity 
differences (including different excipients used) between the products.  
Toxicology & Environmental Risk Assessment 
The applicant did not conduct non-clinical toxicology studies with MYL-1701P. Due to the 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1 guidelines, studies regarding toxicology (including 
developmental and reproductive toxicity studies), are not required for non-clinical testing of 
biosimilars. Furthermore, studies regarding safety pharmacology, carcinogenicity and local tolerance 
are likewise not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. The Applicant’s approach is considered 
appropriate. 
Aflibercept is already used in existing marketed products (Eylea) and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure is anticipated. Therefore, Aflibercept Viatris is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  line  with  the  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), no 
in  vivo  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  performed  under  the  assumption  that  the  biosimilar 
comparability exercise for the physicochemical and biological characteristics and the non-clinical in vitro 
studies are considered satisfactory.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 26/104 
 
 
 
Overall, the comprehensive in vitro biosimilarity exercise provided by the Applicant is considered to 
be  sufficiently  sensitive  and  discriminatory  to  detect  potential  differences  between  the  biosimilar 
candidate MYL-1701P and its comparators EU-, US- and JP-Eylea. For a thorough assessment, please 
refer to the discussion and conclusion of the quality section.   
No  non-clinical  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  which  is  accepted,  as  they  are  not 
required for the non-clinical testing of biosimilars according to the same guideline as cited above.  
Furthermore, no pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies were conducted for MYL-1701P, 
which is acceptable.  
Following the general requirements for Article 10(4) application from non-clinical perspective, sufficient 
data has been provided. Studies on genotoxic and carcinogenic potential as well as for reproductive 
toxicology and local tolerance are not required for biosimilars.  
Studies with originator have shown embryo-foetal toxicity and results from studies in monkeys with 
high systemic exposure indicate that aflibercept can impair male and female fertility.  
Proposed SmPC is in accordance with the PI for Eylea (10/02/2022, EMEA/H/C/002392 - II/0078). 
Overall, from a non-clinical perspective, no major concerns have been raised. There are no objections 
to authorisation of this medicinal product.

2.4.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.1.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated Phase I human PK study was conducted for MYL-1701P. Instead, supportive PK analyses 
were conducted in a subset of patients enrolled in MYL-1701P-3001, which was acceptable, since 
systemic exposure after intravitreal injection is expected to be low, and due to ethical considerations. 
Analytical Methods 
PK ELISA 
The ELISA used for quantification of Aflibercept (MYL-1701P and Eylea) in human CTAD plasma has 
been validated in line with the GL on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). 
The assays ability to quantitate both Eylea and MYL-1701P in CTAD plasma using a single assay 
approach (standards prepared only with the biosimilar) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The 
method is linear within the range of 15.0 ng/mL (LLOQ) and 400 ng/mL (ULOQ). Performance of the 
assay during clinical study MYL-1701P-3001 is considered acceptable. The Applicant confirmed dilution 
linearity of study samples. Overall, the PK ELISA for quantification of Aflibercept in CTAD plasma 
(method 19-002) can be considered as suitable for its intended purpose.  
Bioequivalence 
Clinical study MYL-1701P-3001 was conducted to evaluate the clinical similarity of MYL-1701P and 
Eylea with regards to efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of 
subjects with DME. Supportive PK analyses were conducted in a subset of patients enrolled in MYL-
1701P-3001. 
At least 32 subjects in each study arm were planned to be included in the PK subset. This target has 
been met for both relevant time points: 41 and 37 subjects (MYL-1701P), and 44 and 38 subjects 
(Eylea) were assessed at V2 (2 days after the first injection) and V7A (2 days after the 5th injection), 
respectively. 
Subjects included in the PK subset comprised patients agreeing to participate also to PK sampling. The 
patients enrolled under this PK sub-study had a separate stratification at the IWRS level to ensure 
equal distribution among the treatment groups. The Applicant presented demographics, general 
baseline data and disease characteristics for the PK subset for both treatment groups upon request. 
The demographic profiles and baseline characteristics of the PK subset were largely comparable 
between the treatment groups. More males were included in the PK subset of the Eylea arm compared 
to MYL-1701P (63.8% vs 54.8%), which might suggest a higher body weight in the Eylea group. 
Conversely, the mean body weight was even lower in the Eylea group (82.6 kg vs 85.3 kg MYL-1701P) 
and more obese subjects (BMI >30) were included in the MYL-1701P group (54.8% vs 31.9% Eylea), 
which may have an impact of systemic drug exposure. However, despite these imbalances in baseline 
data for the PK subset, no concern is raised, as systemic exposure of aflibercept after intravitreal 
injection is generally low and interpretable results indicated similarity between the treatment groups 
(see below). For all the subjects in the PK subpopulation, concentrations of aflibercept (free drug) are 
summarized at each scheduled sampling time (Table 2). Most of the plasma concentrations across all 
visits were below the LLOQ (BLQ) in both the treatment arms. Peak plasma concentrations were 
observed post-dose at Day 2 (both at Visit 2 and Visit 7A). The mean plasma concentrations at Day 2 
after first dose were 25.2 ng/mL in MYL-1701P arm and 27.6 ng/mL in Eylea arm. The mean plasma 
concentrations at Day 2 after the 5th dose were 34.4 ng/mL in MYL-1701P and 30.8 ng/mL in the 
Eylea arm. In general, the mean values for plasma concentrations were similar in both arms at 
corresponding time points. Even at time points with peak plasma concentrations, a large proportion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023

subjects in both arms had BLQ plasma concentrations. It is critically noted that observed mean values 
are not far above the LLOQ (15.0 ng/mL), which in principle could hamper the interpretation of results. 
However, as systemic exposure to aflibercept after intravitreal injection was expected to be low, and 
indeed the results do confirm this for both treatment arms, this is acceptable. There was no sign of 
accumulation of free aflibercept after repeated intravitreal dosing. 
At V2 (2 days after the first injection), no considerable differences were observed between ADA 
positive and ADA negative subjects. At V7A (2 days after 5th injection), ADA positive subjects had 
lower mean free aflibercept values compared to ADA negative subjects, while the opposite was 
observed in the Eylea arm. However, only 2 patients in the MYL-1701P arm and 4 patients in the Eylea 
arm were ADA positive at both time points, and this observation is considered a random finding. No 
conclusion from these patients is possible and this observation does not raise any further concerns.

2.4.1.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eylea is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for 
intravitreal administration. 
The active pharmacologic agent, in Eylea (aflibercept), acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds to 
VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby inhibits the binding and activation of their cognate receptors VEGFR-1 
and VEGFR-2, which are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Activation through VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2 is associated with neovascularization and vascular permeability, while inhibition of activation 
by Eylea (aflibercept) has been demonstrated to reduce both processes, with clinical benefit in the 
indicated disorders. 
The mechanism of action is described sufficiently. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical comparative PD studies have been performed with MYL-1701P. 
In clinical study MYL-1701P-3001 central retinal thickness (CRT) over time determined by SD-OCT was 
included as key secondary endpoint to reflect PD aspects of aflibercept. Lesion characteristics such as 
presence of leakage or hemorrhage were evaluated using fundus photography (FP) and/or fluorescein 
angiography (FA). 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics: The PK profiles of MYL-1701P and US-Eylea were compared in a subset of patients 
enrolled in clinical Phase III study (MYL-1701P-3001) to support a comparative evaluation between the 
two products.  
Based on the comprehensive quality- and non-clinical bridging exercise, the use of an US-approved 
reference product is accepted.  
Systemic exposure of aflibercept after intravitreal injection is expected to be low. It was therefore 
acceptable that PK would be assessed in a subset of DME patients only. It was agreed that comparative 
PK assessment of free aflibercept around the expected maximum systemic exposure would be 
considered appropriate and supportive only. No formal hypothesis testing was planned for, and at least 
32 subjects in each study arm were planned to be included in the PK subset, which is accepted. This 
target has been met for both investigated PK time points: 41 and 37 subjects (MYL-1701P), and 44 
and 38 subjects (Eylea) were assessed at V2 (anticipated Tmax) and V7A (anticipated Cmax at steady 
state), respectively. 
As expected, interpretable results were only observed 2 days after the first injection (V2) and 2 days 
after the 5th injection (V7A), and most of the plasma concentrations across all visits were below the 
LLOQ (BLQ) in both the treatment arms. At those time points, mean values for plasma concentrations 
were similar in both treatment arms, supporting biosimilarity. 
The maximum concentration of systemic aflibercept was higher in the Eylea arm (244.30 ng/ml) 
compared to MYL-1701P (108.40 ng/ml) at V2 (Tmax). However, as maximum concentrations at V7A 
(Cmax at steady state) as well as mean concentrations at Tmax and Cmax at steady state were 
comparable between groups, no concern regarding biosimilarity is expected from this observation. 
Reassuringly, there was no sign of accumulation of free aflibercept after repeated intravitreal dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 31/104 
 
 
 
No considerable differences in plasma levels were observed between ADA positive and ADA negative 
subjects. However, the number of ADA positive subjects in the PK subset was too small for meaningful 
interpretation of these data. 
In conclusion, the overall complementary PK assessment in a subset of DME patients supports 
biosimilarity between MYL-1701P and Eylea. 
Pharmacodynamics: No dedicated comparative PD investigations have been performed as part of the 
clinical biosimilarity exercise. This is accepted, as there are no applicable laboratory PD markers that 
could serve as specific surrogates for clinical efficacy and safety of aflibercept. PD aspects were 
sufficiently addressed by including CRT over time as secondary endpoint in the pivotal clinical study 
MYL-1701P-3001. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Assessment of systemic aflibercept levels conducted in a subset of patients in the pivotal clinical study 
MYL-1701P-3001 support biosimilarity, as mean aflibercept plasma concentrations at Cmax were 
similar between the reference product Eylea and biosimilar Yesafili. 
The use of a non-EU reference product in this clinical trial is accepted. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.4.1.  Main study 
MYL-1701P-3001 
This was a multi center, randomized, double masked, active controlled, comparative clinical study to 
demonstrate that no clinically meaningful differences exist between MYL-1701P and US-licensed Eylea 
in subjects with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). 
The maximum planned study duration from screening to end of the study was up to 13 months/56 
weeks.

would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results. 
Sentinel Dosing Cohort 
Since this was the first in human study of MYL-1701P, a sentinel cohort dosing was planned. Safety 
was to be first evaluated in a sentinel cohort of 9 subjects, with at least 3 subjects receiving MYL-
1701P. Upon enrolment of the 9th subject in the sentinel cohort, enrolment had to be stopped. 
Enrollment could be reinstated based on the final decision of the Sentinel Cohort Data Review 
Committee (SCDRC). Only if the SCDRC confirmed that there are no safety concerns, the remainder of 
the study subjects could be enrolled into the study and dosed per protocol.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are largely in line with registrational studies for Eylea and Scientific 
Advice and therefore deemed acceptable. Although a baseline BCVA range of 50-69 letters would have 
been preferred by EMA, the selected range (38-73 letters) may be suitable, with the caveats that 
assessment of decreases in visual acuity may be difficult in legally blind patients, i.e. 38 letters of 
BCVA (20/200), and there may be limited room for improvement in subjects with a BCVA of 73 letters 
(20/40). Upon request, the Applicant provided separate subgroup analyses for the preferred range of 
50-69 letters to ensure an overall view of the treatment effect in the most sensitive part of the 
subjects.

Treatments 
The use of US-sourced Eylea as reference product is acceptable. 
Subjects received intravitreal injections of either 2 mg MYL-1701P or 2 mg US-Eylea throughout the 
52-week treatment period, with planned doses at Study Day 1, Day 29 (week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), 
Day 85 (Week 12), Day 113 (Week 16), Day 169 (Week 24), Day 225 (Week 32), Day 281 (Week 40) 
and Day 337 (Week 48). 
In addition to the nine planned doses, study drug administration was also allowed at Week 20, Week 
28, Week 36 and Week 44 based on the visual acuity, and/or SD-OCT at that visit and in accordance 
with the “criteria for administering additional 4-weekly doses” (see below; following the q4w dosing for 
the first 5 injections) or at the Investigator’s discretion. 
The additional doses were administered by the investigator only if the subject met any of the following 
criteria: 
•  Worsening of visual acuity, demonstrated as decrease in ETDRS by ≥ 5 letters from previous 
scheduled visit 
• 
Increase in CRT by ≥ 50μm as measured by SD-OCT, from previous scheduled visit 
In the rare case, if the Investigator intended to administer additional dose for any reason, other than 
the criteria described above, the same was to be discussed and approved by the study medical monitor 
and the same was adequately documented. 
Criteria for IP Discontinuation 
Treatment was to be discontinued if any of the following reasons applied (but were not limited to): 
• 
• 
The subject withdrew the consent. 
Pregnancy. 
•  At the investigator’s discretion, if it was in the subject’s best interest due to occurrence of an 
AE and/or other findings considered to present a safety concern to continued dosing with study 
drug, which included but not limited to: 
o  Development of hypersensitivity reaction suspected to be attributable to study drug 
which may have contraindicated the continued dosing with the study drug 
o  Development of ocular or periocular infection, active intraocular inflammation which 
may have contraindicated the continued dosing with the study drug 
•  Despite education/reinforcement, the subject showed persistent inadequate compliance with 
required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring while on study 
drug based on investigator’s discretion. 
•  Use of prohibited therapy presenting a safety concern to continued dosing with study drug 
•  At the investigator’s discretion, in certain situations such as disease flare, progression, or 
nonresponse that required treatment with a prohibited medication or procedure, which in the 
opinion of the investigator warranted treatment withdrawal. 
• 
If the mask (blinding) was broken for a subject by the Investigator 
For discontinued subjects, documented follow-up by phone or in person was performed. Subjects who 
prematurely terminate study will have an Early Termination (ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 36/104 
 
 
 
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the subject so that 
they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. All contact attempts should be documented in the 
subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will 
he/she be considered to have been withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-
up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should 
be recorded in the CRF.  
Subjects discontinued from the study were not replaced. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To evaluate the clinical equivalence of Yesafili and Eylea over 8 weeks of treatment at doses and 
regimen recommended by the Prescribing Information for Eylea, as assessed by change from baseline 
to Week 8 in BCVA. 
Secondary Objectives 
The key secondary objective of this study was: 
•

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA as assessed by ETDRS 
letters at Week 8. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was 
• 
The mean change from baseline in CRT as determined by spectral-domain-optical coherence 
tomography (SD-OCT) over time 
The other secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
The mean change in BCVA over time 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 37/104 
 
 
 
• 
Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters from Baseline in BCVA, assessed in change from 
baseline in ETDRS letters over time 
•  Number of administrations of study drug required 
Sample size 
With equivalence limits of (-3, +3) letters, together with an assumed true treatment difference of zero 
letters, a standard deviation (SD) of 7.06 letters, and with 95% two-sided CIs, 145 evaluable subjects 
per arm provide 90% power. A total of 324 subjects were planned to be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 
each arm after allowing for approximately 10% dropouts. 
The study was conducted during COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 on the study is 
provided in detail in Section 9.8.4 of MYL-1701P-3001, 52-Week CSR. In addition, as per Protocol 
Version 3.0 (dated 09 Jun 2020), one extra subject was to be randomized for each subject who met 
any of the three following pre-specified criteria because of the COVID-19 pandemic: 
Missed study drug administration at Visit 4 / Week 4 
Missed BCVA examination for the study eye at Visit 5 / Week 8 
Delayed BCVA examination for the study eye at Visit 5 / Week 8 by more than 7 days from the 
scheduled visit date 
Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic and recruitment to the date of Protocol Version 3.0 (09 Jun 
2020), the maximum number of these extra subjects was determined to be 70. The number of extra 
subjects required were determined by the review of protocol deviations related to the above-
mentioned criteria. The review was done at the time of restarting recruitment after a brief hold in 
recruitment because of COVID-19 pandemic.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Blinding (masking) 
Considering the ophthalmology indication, the term “masking” has been used instead of “blinding” 
throughout the protocol. 
A 24-week CSR was developed after the last subject completed the 24 weeks of study participation. 
This final clinical study report (52-week CSR) was developed after the last subject completed 52 weeks 
of study participation. This CSR contains the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity 
data through 52 weeks for all randomized subjects. 
At the time of 24 Week CSR, a pre-identified team was unmasked, and rest of the study team 
continued to be masked until the database lock for the Week 52 analysis. Unmasking of treatment 
code for final data analysis had to be done after database lock. 
The investigators and subjects were masked to individual participant treatment assignment for as long 
as the individual participant remained in the study. Upon request, the Applicant clarified that 
investigators and participants continued to be masked even after individual participants completed the 
study and that the general unmasking was performed after the database lock. Further, the unmasking 
procedure for investigators, patients, sponsors and other staff was explained and it was concluded that 
unmasking did not influence study integrity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 38/104 
 
 
 
Masked Personnel: Investigator was masked throughout the study. Investigator/designee performed all 
study assessments prior to and following study drug administration. Investigator had also to decide on 
the requirement of optional injections as necessary. 
Unmasked Personnel 
If an alternate ophthalmologist was available at the site: 
An alternate ophthalmologist was identified to be responsible for preparation and administration of the 
study drug. Ophthalmologist administering the study drug performed the post injection procedures like 
measurement of IOP and any safety assessments up to 30 minutes after the study drug 
administration. However, the ophthalmologist administering the study drug did not perform any other 
study assessments including safety and efficacy assessments. If the unmasked ophthalmologist was 
not available at 30 minutes after dosing, the masked ophthalmologist performed post-dose safety 
assessments. 
Additional unmasked site personnel were identified to be responsible for the receipt, tracking, 
preparation and destruction of study drug. 
If an alternate ophthalmologist was not available at the site; and a qualified unmasked Pharmacist or 
Physician Assistant was available at site: 
In cases, where the site did not have an alternate ophthalmologist, a qualified unmasked study 
personnel, i.e., unmasked pharmacist, physician assistant, was identified to be responsible for the 
receipt, tracking, preparation and destruction of study drug. The identified qualified 
pharmacist/physician assistant prepared the drug and handed over the syringe to the masked 
Investigator for intravitreal administration. 
There was a possibility that unmasked person may come to know of treatment assignment while 
preparing the study drug for administration due to minor differences in the look and feel of the vials. 
MYL-1701P vial had a light grey stopper cap while the Eylea vial had blue stopper cap. This is 
acceptable, as responsibilities of unmasked personnel included preparation of study drug, but study 
drug administration was performed by the masked Investigator [except when alternate (unmasked) 
ophthalmologist was identified at site, see above]. 
The central SD-OCT assessment, and central laboratory assessment, including safety, PK and 
immunogenicity, were performed by the masked personnel.  
The responsibilities of the masked personnel are as follows: 
• 
Perform all screening procedures up until randomization 
•  Assess inclusion/exclusion criteria 
•  Obtain medical, surgical, ophthalmic, and smoking history 
•  Obtain informed consent 
•  Collect and process samples for laboratory testing 
•  Acquire SD - OCT, fundus photography (FP), and fluorescein angiography (FA) images and 
transfer them to reading centers 
•  Acquire ECGs 
• 
Perform study drug administration (when preparation of study drug is done by an identified 
unmasked pharmacist, physician assistant at the site) 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 39/104 
 
 
 
• 
Perform post-treatment safety assessments (except for post injection procedures like 
measurement of IOP and any safety assessments up to 30 minutes after the study drug 
administration when there was an identified unmasked ophthalmologist). 
•  Decide on need for additional treatment, if any 
•  Assess AEs, including severity and relationship 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Perform complete OE at all study visits 
Evaluate all safety, including review of images for safety concerns at the site 
Evaluate vital signs and ECGs; perform physical examinations 
Test refraction and BCVA 
•  Check IOP 
•  Assess SD - OCT, FP/FA. 
Responsibilities of the Unmasked Personnel are as follows: 
•  Receipt, tracking, and destruction of study drug 
• 
Prepare study drug 
•  Study drug administration and post injection procedures like measurement of IOP and any 
safety assessments up to 30 minutes after the study drug administration (when alternate 
ophthalmologist is identified at the site) 
Breaking the Mask 
The masked treatment code was not to be broken, except in emergency situations for which the 
identification of the study treatment of a subject was required by the Investigator in case of a medical 
emergency and when the knowledge of the study treatment allocation was required for appropriate 
management of the medical event.  
Unmasking of treatment code for final data analysis had to be done after database lock. Unmasking 
process had to be performed in accordance with both Sponsor’s and CRO’s unmasking SOPs, as 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
In an event if the mask was broken for a subject by the Investigator, that subject had to be withdrawn 
from the study. Upon request, the Applicant confirmed that no patient was withdrawn following 
breaking the mask. Furthermore, according to the protocol, if an alternate ophthalmologist was 
available at the site, unmasked personnel was responsible for preparation and administration of the 
study drug. According to the Applicant, unmasked personnel did not have true unmasked information. 
Reassuringly, to avoid the risk of unmasking at the site level, two separate teams were formed: the 
masked team was responsible to review efficacy and safety endpoints, whereas the unmasked team 
was responsible to handle study drug management (receipt, administration and destruction). Hence, 
the unmasked investigator administering the study drug did not participate in any efficacy or safety 
endpoint evaluations apart from the immediate post-injection period (30 minutes post-injection). It is 
therefore agreed that no impact on study integrity is expected.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 40/104 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA as assessed by ETDRS 
letters at Week 8. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on an MMRM analysis on mean change from 
baseline in BCVA as assessed by ETDRS letter score at, Week 8. This analysis was based on data 
collected up to Week 8. 
This model will include treatment, visit/time (in weeks), treatment-by-visit interaction, and region as 
fixed effects and baseline BCVA as a covariate. The within subject variance-covariance matrix was 
assumed to be unstructured (which does not presume a particular correlation structure for repeated 
measurement within subjects over time), estimation used restricted maximum likelihood, and the 
denominator degrees of freedom used the Kenward-Roger estimate. The MMRM model results are 
presented with an estimate (Least Square [LS] means), standard error, and 95% two-sided CIs for the 
treatment difference (with Eylea group being the reference category) at week 8. 
Per EMA’s requirement, equivalence was demonstrated if the treatment difference of mean change in 
BCVA, from baseline to Week 8 based on 95% CI was fully contained within the interval (-3, 3). The 
primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set and it included data from all visits 
regardless of whether the subject was still receiving study medication. 
The following sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed: 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
Per protocol (PP) Analysis Set. 
•  Where BCVA values after discontinuing study medication were excluded. 
•  Where missing BCVA values at Week 8 were replaced by LOCF approach using the analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
• 
Tipping point analysis for delta method using multiple imputation. 
Additional sensitivity and supplementary analyses were conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19-
related disruptions on the study. 
It is critically noted, that no reference to the E9(R1) terminology in regard to estimands are made in 
the CSR. For transparency purposes, it would be preferred to include results of analyses that use the 
appropriate estimations for targets of estimation that are relevant to this type if study objective. That 
is, both estimands employing "hypothetical" for all intercurrent events and "treatment policy" for all 
intercurrent events. Of note, for the most relevant intercurrent events these analyses were in essence 
already conducted (but reported as sensitivity analyses). Hence, the comment is minor and for 
transparency purposes only. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint based on the parameters baseline 
BCVA, age, gender, race, ethnicity, geographic region, baseline HbA1c, use of anti-VEGF therapy in 
fellow eye prior to week 8 and ADA status. 
The key secondary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in CRT as determined by SD-
OCT at Week 8 (corresponding tables were prepared for the 24-week analysis only). 
The analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable was performed in a similar manner as the analysis 
of the primary efficacy endpoint using central CRT reading of all the SD-OCT images across visits 
including subgroup analyses and forest plot for subgroups. 
The mean change in BCVA over time was analyzed in a similar manner as the primary efficacy 
endpoint, but the analysis was to be based on data collected up to the data cut for the respective 
Assessment report

clinical study report (CSR; Week 24 or Week 52). The proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters 
from baseline in BCVA across visits were presented by treatment. The same summary was also 
presented for subjects who gained ≥5 and ≥10 letters as well as subjects who lost ≥5, ≥10 and ≥15 
letters. 
The number of intravitreal injections of study drug administered over the treatment period was 
descriptively summarized. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics (free aflibercept concentrations) was evaluated for subjects participating in 
pharmacokinetic (PK) subset. At least 32 subjects in each study arm were planned to be included in 
the PK subset. Overall, 89 subjects consented and participated in the PK subset (42 subjects in the 
MYL-1701P arm and 47 subjects in the Eylea arm). 
The PK subset analysis set consisted of all subjects who consented for participation in PK subpopulation 
and have at least one measured concentration of study drug. The patients enrolled under this PK sub-
study had a separate stratification at the IWRS level to ensure equal distribution among the treatment 
groups. The PK sampling was to be done in these subjects as per the Study Schedule. This strategy is 
acknowledged.  
All concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ, i.e. below 15.0 ng/mL) values have 
been analyzed as ‘0’. While in principle this is not a conservative imputation, the concentrations are 
considered overall very low, so that an imputation with the LLOQ would not change the overall 
conclusion that concentrations are low in both treatment arms, and therefore no concern arises. In the 
summary tables, a row indicates the number of subjects with aflibercept concentrations below LLOQ. 
Analyses Sets 
All deviations/violations and exclusions of subjects from analysis sets were identified and finalized at 
the blinded data review (BDR) meeting prior to the study unmasking for the 24-week analysis. 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set consisted of all subjects who were randomized. Subjects 
were included in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized. The ITT 
analysis set was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
The safety analysis set (Safety Set) consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug. Subjects were included in the analysis according to the actual treatment received. The 
safety analysis set was the primary analysis set for safety analyses. 
The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized subjects who received any study drug, who 
had a baseline BCVA, and who also had at least one post dosing BCVA assessment up to Week 8. 
Subjects were included in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized. The 
FAS provided supportive data for the primary efficacy analysis. 
The per-protocol (PP) analysis set consisted of all FAS subjects who had no major protocol 
deviations (i.e., no violation which affected the primary efficacy outcome). Major protocol deviations 
included one or more of the following categories: 
•  Did not receive treatment to which they were randomized 
• 
• 
• 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria violations which can impact the primary efficacy analysis 
Intake of forbidden concomitant medication which can impact the primary efficacy analysis 
Treatment deviation (missed 1 or more injections prior to Week 8) 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 42/104 
 
 
 
In addition, further deviations were considered major if they impacted the primary efficacy analysis. 
Potential protocol deviations were collected during the study within ICON’s ICOTRIAL system. The list 
of subjects excluded from the PP analysis set and the precise reasons for exclusion were finalized at 
the BDR meeting held prior to database lock for Week 24 (Section 2.1.3 of BDR report V1.0). 
The PK subset analysis set consisted of all subjects who had signed the ICF for participation in PK 
subpopulation and had at least one measured concentration of study treatment. 
The SAP (Version 1.0) was finalized on 08 Jan 2019 and amended on 29 Jan 2021 (Version 2.0) and 
on 21 Apr 2021 (Version 3.0).  
Changes to the planned analysis is detailed in SAP Version 3.0: For mean change from baseline in CRT 
over time, the following two additional analyses were performed: (1) using the investigator 
assessment and (2) central reading including indeterminate values. 
(1) According to final SAP version 3.0, for the analysis of the secondary endpoint mean change from 
baseline in CRT, only the central reading was considered and, the CRT values provided by the 
Investigators based on their evaluation of the SD-OCT scan images were not considered. An additional 
analysis was performed utilizing the CRT values recorded by the Investigators. In addition, a line graph 
with time (in weeks) presented on the x-axis and mean change from baseline in CRT presented on the 
y-axis was provided with LOCF imputation method for the ITT analysis set. 
(2) The secondary analysis in SAP utilizing the central reader CRT values did not consider the values 
that were flagged as ‘indeterminate’. According to the standard operating procedures of the central 
reading center, the reader would have indicated a CRT value as “indeterminate” in cases where the 
SD-OCT images had some quality issues such as poor segmentation or centering. An additional 
analysis was performed using all CRT values including any values flagged as indeterminate. In 
addition, a line graph with time (in weeks) presented on the x-axis and mean change from baseline in 
CRT presented on the y-axis was provided with LOCF imputation method for the ITT analysis set. 
Handling of missing data and outliers 
Missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. No 
imputation will be employed for the descriptive summaries and listings. Missing post-baseline values 
will be imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) before calculating the proportions of 
subjects who gained or lost letters (secondary efficacy endpoints). The LOCF imputation used for the 
above sensitivity analyses is not considered conservative for the hypothesis of equivalence testing and 
does therefore not provide strong additional support in favour of equivalence.

Figure 3. Subject Disposition Chart 
As per protocol V 3.0, one extra subject was to be randomized for each subject who met any of the 
pre-specified criteria related to missed/delayed dosing and/or study assessments because of the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In total, 31 additional subjects were randomized 
based on these criteria. Upon request, the Applicant clarified that no subjects were discontinued after 
meeting the pre-defined criteria to trigger randomization of an extra subject. The effort to increase the 
sample size is acknowledged.

A total of 639 (unique) subjects were screened; upon request, it was clarified that 34 re-screening 
events occurred, resulting in a total number of 673 screening events, of which 318 were screening 
failures. Hence, a total of 355 subjects were randomized with 179 subjects to the MYL-1701P arm and 
176 subjects to the Eylea arm.  
A total of 172 (96.1%) subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 173 (98.3%) in the Eylea arm completed 
the study up to Week 8, and a total of 161 (89.9%) subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 158 (89.8%) 
subjects in the Eylea arm completed Week 52 / End of Study Visit. 
The treatment arms were similar in terms of proportion of subjects completing the study (161 [89.9%] 
in MYL-1701P arm vs 158 [89.8%] in Eylea arm). The observed high and similar retention rate in both 
treatment arms can be considered as supporting evidence that trial conduct was good with little need 
for data imputation and overall good interpretability of the obtained study data. The reasons for early 
discontinuation of subjects from the study were also comparable between the arms, withdrawal of 
consent (8 [4.5%] in MYL-1701P arm vs 9 [5.1%] in Eylea arm) being the most common reason 
followed by withdrawal due to adverse events (5 [2.8%] in MYL-1701P arm vs 4 [2.3%] in Eylea arm). 
Five deaths occurred: 2 (1.1%) in the MYL-1701P arm vs 3 (1.7%) in the Eylea arm. 
Disposition of subjects per treatment arm in the ITT set is summarized in Table 3.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
Protocol Version 1.0 dated 27 Nov 2017, was used for regulatory consultation with the USFDA and 
EMA. The suggestions from the Agencies were implemented in the Protocol Version 2.0 dated 07 Feb 
2018. The study was initiated with Protocol Version 2.0 dated 07 Feb 2018. The Protocol Version 2.0 
was updated to Protocol Version 3.0 dated 09 Jun 2020 to address the potential impact of COVID-19 
pandemic. In addition, this amendment included minor modifications to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
based on the feedback from Investigators and Country Agencies. 
Protocol Deviations

Protocol deviations were categorized as key (or important) and non-key (or unimportant) based on 
protocol deviation criteria form (PDCF). The key and non-key PDs are summarized in Table 4. 
The number of subjects with at least one key PD were comparable between the arms, 122 (68.2%) in 
MYL-1701P arm and 129 (73.3%) in Eylea arm. 
Table 4: Summary of Key Protocol Deviations – ITT Set 
During the Blinded Data Review (BDR) for 24 Week analysis, a total of 21 key PDs in 16 subjects were 
classified as major (7 deviations in 5 (2.8%) subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 14 deviations in 11 
(6.3%) subjects in the Eylea arm) and those subjects were excluded from the PP analysis set as 
described in the BDR report. 
Major PDs in both arms are provided in Table 5.

This study was subject to audit by the Sponsor or designee at intervals to ensure that the clinical study 
was conducted, and data were generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with 
the study protocol; ICH, GCP E6 consolidated guidelines; and other applicable regulations. 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
The compliance to the study treatment, as measured by the proportion of planned injections received, 
was similar between both the treatment arms (93.0% in the MYL-1701P arm vs 94.4% in the Eylea 
arm; see Section 2.4.7.1. Patient exposure, Table 3).  
The median treatment duration was 364 days in each of the study arms. The mean (SD) number of 
doses received in each of the treatment arms was similar [8.4 (2.06) in MYL-1701P arm and 8.7 (1.76) 
in Eylea arm]. Majority of the subjects in both arms maintained an overall compliance of ≥75% for the 
planned doses. (89.3% in MYL-1701P arm and 94.9% in Eylea arm). There was a higher proportion of 
subjects in the MYL-1701P arm who missed more than 2 planned doses compared to Eylea arm (8.4% 
vs 4.0%) which is leading to a slightly lower proportion of subjects in MYL-1701P arm having 
Assessment report

compliance of ≥75% compared to the Eylea arm. Majority of these missed doses were due to COVID-19 
pandemic related missed study visits. 
A total of 96 (27.1%) subjects received at least one additional dose of study drug treatment as per the 
criteria mentioned in Section Treatments. Out of these 96 subjects, 54 (30.3%) subjects in MYL-1701P 
arm and 42 (23.9%) subjects in Eylea arm received at least one additional optional dose of the study 
drug. This finding is in contrast to similar proportions of subjects receiving > 9 planned injections. The 
discrepancy can be explained by more additional optional doses in patients in the MYL-1701P arm, who 
received less than 9 planned doses, i.e. who missed planned doses (see Other Secondary Efficacy 
Parameters). 
There were no dosing errors (like wrong study drug treatment received) reported in this study.

Baseline General and Disease Characteristics 
At baseline, there were no notable differences between the treatment arms for body weight, BMI, 
HbA1c and smoking status of the subjects. The mean (SD) body weight was 81.80 kg (18.864). The 
mean (SD) BMI was 29.35 (5.859). The mean (SD) baseline HbA1c was 7.70% (1.074). 
A tabular summary of the disease characteristics at baseline is provided in Table 7. Both treatment 
arms were well balanced with respect to ocular disease characteristics at baseline.

The majority (53.5%) of patients had high baseline BCVA of 65 or higher. As highlighted earlier, there 
may be limited room for improvement in patients with high BCVA and hence ceiling effects may affect 
assessment of biosimilarity. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess possible confounding of the 
overall magnitude of treatment differences by a proportion of patients that is potentially less sensitive 
to identify treatment differences (discussed in Section Ancillary analyses). 
The distribution of DRSS (diabetic retinopathy severity score) was similar across treatment arms. The 
ETDRS DRSS was 47 in 58% of the subjects denoting moderately severe non-proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy (NPDR). There was one subject with a DRSS score of 65 in the MYL-1701P arm, which 
denotes proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This subject was included in the study analyses as the 
PDR was not active with absence of any neovascularization, and therefore not meeting exclusion 
criterion 4e. 
Table 7: Summary of Baseline Ophthalmologic Characteristics – ITT Set 
Medical and Surgical History 
In general, both treatment arms were similar in terms of ocular and non-ocular medical and surgical 
history. All the subjects in either arm had at least one ocular and non-ocular medical history. All 
subjects had a history of diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2). The ocular and non-ocular medical and 
surgical history are typical of this study population. 
Apart from the diabetic retinopathy and diabetic retinal edema, the most commonly reported ocular 
medical history in the study eye were cataract (MYL-1701P, 76 [42.5%] and Eylea, 63 [35.8%]), 
cataract nuclear (MYL-1701P, 15 [8.4%] and Eylea, 17 [9.7%]) and retinal haemorrhage (MYL-1701P, 
9 [5.0%] and Eylea, 9 [5.1%]). The most common past ocular procedures reported for the study eye 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 48/104 
 
 
 
 
included retinal laser coagulation (MYL-1701P, 27 [15.1%] and Eylea, 19 [10.8%]); cataract operation 
(MYL-1701P, 20 [11.2%] and Eylea, 24 [13.6%]); intraocular lens implant (MYL-1701P, 10 [5.6%] and 
Eylea, 9 [5.1]). A sufficient wash out period required by the study protocol had elapsed after the 
procedures at the time of randomization for all these subjects. 
The most commonly reported non-ocular medical history were in the SOCs of Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (MYL-1701P, 179 [100%] and Eylea 176 [100%]); Vascular disorders (MYL-1701P, 142 
[79.3%] and Eylea 134 [76.1%]); Surgical and medical procedures (MYL-1701P, 64 [35.8%] and Eylea 
62 [35.2%]); and Nervous system disorders (MYL-1701P, 47 [26.3%] and Eylea 58 [33.0%]). 
Prior Medications and Treatments 
Overall, 99.4% of the subjects had at least one prior medication (177 [98.9%] in MYL-1701P arm and 
176 [100%] in Eylea). The proportion of subjects who were on specific classes of prior medications 
were largely similar across the two arms. 
Apart from the mydriatics and the cycloplegics used during the screening procedures, the other most 
commonly used prior medications by anatomic therapeutic chemical class were blood glucose lowering 
agents (143 [79.9%] in the MYL-1701P arm and 144 [81.8%] in Eylea); insulins and its analogues (91 
[50.8%] in the MYL-1701P arm and 90 [51.1%] in Eylea); and lipid modifying agents, plain (74 
[41.3%] in the MYL-1701P arm and 79 [44.9%] in Eylea). 
Concomitant Medications 
Overall, 99.7% of the subjects received at least one non-study medication during the study (178 
[99.4%] in MYL-1701P arm and 176 [100%] in Eylea arm).  
It should be noted that the frequently reported topical anesthetics and antibiotics were part of pre-
medications. Apart from these, the most frequently reported concomitant medications by PT were 
metformin (47 [26.3%] subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 47 [26.7%] subjects in the Eylea arm), 
metformin hydrochloride (47 [26.3%] subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 40 [22.7%] subjects in the 
Eylea arm), and tropicamide (78 [43.6%] subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 96 [54.5%] subjects in 
the Eylea arm). 
A significant proportion of subjects (100 [28.2%]) used intraocular anti-VEGF agents such as 
bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept in the fellow eye [45 (25.1%) subjects in the MYL-1701P 
and 55 (31.3%) subjects in the Eylea arm]. These medications were utilized as part of the standard of 
care management for the fellow eye disease. To investigate a possible confounding effect of 
concomitant anti-VEGF therapy in the fellow eye, subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints [any anti-VEGF therapy in fellow eye prior to visit 5 (Week 8)(yes, no)]. 
In general, the demographic characteristics as well as other baseline parameters such as medical and 
ophthalmologic history, prior and concomitant medications were balanced between treatment arms. 
Numbers analysed 
Sample size targets for primary endpoint assessment (total n = 324) as well as PK subset (n = 32 per 
treatment group) have been met (Table 8).

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA as assessed by ETDRS 
letter score, at Week 8. As defined by the Applicant, the primary analysis was performed on the ITT 
analysis set and included data from all visits up to Week 8 regardless of whether the subject was still 
receiving study medication (Table 9). The adjusted mean difference for mean change in BCVA from 
baseline to Week 8 was 0.04 letters and 95% CI was [-1.40, 1.47] which were within the pre-defined 
equivalence range of [-3, +3] letters. In both treatment groups, the effect size was what would be 
expected after treatment with aflibercept.

Table 9: Analysis of Mean Chane in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 by MMRM – ITT Set 
As highlighted in EMA Scientific Advice, primary assessment of the ITT and PP analysis sets is equally 
important to demonstrate biosimilarity, and therefore considered co-primary in this assessment by the 
Rapporteur. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the PP analysis set is shown in Table 10. 
Also for this analysis the 95% CI was within the pre-defined equivalence range of [-3, +3] letters. 
Thus, biosimilarity was demonstrated based on the primary endpoint in the ITT and PP Analysis Sets. 
Upon request, the Applicant clarified that numbers from the line item ‘Subjects with value at baseline 
and this week [8]’ present in most tables for primary and key secondary analyses do not refer to the 
number of patients included in the analyses (adjusted means, SEs, CIs). The Applicant confirmed that 
the MMRM was applied to the overall number of subjects stated in the respective analysis sets, which is 
acceptable. Yet, the assessment of the FAS showed identical outcomes to the ITT population, despite 
different numbers of subjects included. Since only few subjects are concerned (n = 8 for MYL-1701P; n 
= 4 for Eylea), identical results in both analysis sets may be based on the way these analyses were 
defined with respect to eligibility and availability of data. 
Table 10: Analysis of Mean Change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 by MMRM – PP Set 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline in CRT as determined by SD-
OCT over time. There was a reduction in the CRT from Baseline to Week 8 in both the treatment arms 
(Table 11). In both groups, the magnitude of the change from baseline was what would be expected 
after treatment with aflibercept. The adjusted mean difference between treatment arms was 11.46 µm. 
While an equivalence range was not defined for CRT, the 95% CI [-6.22, 29.14] indicated that there 
does not seem to be a relevant difference between the treatment groups, as the estimated lower and 
upper limits were clearly below 50 µm, an increase in CRT, which is defined as clinically relevant to 
trigger additional dosing.

The mean change from baseline for CRT over time is provided in Table 12 and Figure 4. Mean change 
in CRT throughout the entire study duration indicated an increase of improvement in both study arms. 
The adjusted mean difference between the study arms from Week 8 to Week 44 was consistently 
between 7-14 µm in favour of the Eylea arm, while a decrease of the adjusted mean difference 
between treatment arms from Week 48 was observed, with a minimal difference of 2.47 µm in favour 
of the MYL-1701P arm at Week 52. Overall, these differences are considered small, as those are very 
far below 50 µm, a change in CRT that would be considered clinically relevant. Hence, biosimilarity is 
supported by the key secondary efficacy endpoint CRT.

Other Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
Other secondary endpoints included the mean change in BCVA over time up to Week 52 and the 
proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters at Week 52. Both analyses showed similar results 
between the two treatment groups, further supporting biosimilarity. 
The analysis of mean change in BCVA from baseline over time has been provided in Table 13.

Figure 6 depicts the proportion of subjects who gained or lost ≥5, ≥10 and ≥15 letters at Week 52 
(LOCF). The proportion of subjects who gained or lost pre-specified number of letters at Week 52 was 
similar between the two treatment arms. Upon request, the Applicant performed an additional analysis 
on the secondary endpoint “proportion of subjects who gained or lost letters” with an alternative 
imputation technique that utilized a multiple imputation method, since LOCF imputation is not 
considered conservative for the hypothesis of equivalence testing. The results from this sensitivity 
analysis are consistent with the results from the pre-specified analysis, indicating robustness of the 
results.

The number of injections of study drug administered during the study period (ITT population) is 
provided in Table 14. The mean number of doses received during the 52 weeks of study were similar in 
both treatment arms [8.4 in MYL-1701P arm and 8.7 in Eylea arm]. The median number of doses 
received in each of the treatment arms was 9 injections (range: 1, 13). 
Table 14: Summary of Administration of Study Drug Required Over Treatment  
Period – ITT Analysis Set 
Per study protocol a total of nine injections were planned to be administered for the entire study 
duration of 52 weeks, with the option of receiving additional four doses upon worsening of BCVA or

CRT. Although the median number of doses received was indeed nine injections in both treatment 
arms, the median of discrete numbers is an insensitive metric, and indeed only 56.3% of all patients 
received nine doses. Reassuringly, upon request it was clarified that only few of those patients 
received additional doses due to worsening of their condition, since the majority of patients who 
received 9 doses have not received any additional dose (95%). As discussed above, more patients in 
the MYL-1701P arm received at least one additional dose of aflibercept (30.3%) compared to subjects 
receiving Eylea (23.9%) (presumably from week 20) up to Week 52, which is partially attributed to 
more optional doses received after a missed planned dose in patients in the MYL-1701P arm, rather 
than worsening of their condition. A slightly higher proportion of subjects in the Eylea arm received 
less than 9 planned doses. Reassuringly, analyses of BCVA and CRT over time on the ITT and PP sets 
support the conclusion that missed and/or additional doses had no relevant impact on efficacy. 
Ancillary analyses 
Additional Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The following additional sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint: 
•  Analysis of the primary endpoint in which BCVA values after discontinuing study medication 
(i.e., values with an assessment date after the last study medication date) were excluded. 
•  Analysis of the primary endpoint in which missing BCVA values at Week 8 were replaced by 
LOCF approach using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
• 
Tipping point analysis for delta method using multiple imputation. 
Summary tables of sensitivity analyses are provided in Table 15 - Table 16. The results of these 
sensitivity analyses showed equivalence between the 2 treatment arms based on confidence intervals 
within the pre-specified equivalence range.

Values after Discontinuing Study Medication ITT Set

Table 16: Analysis of Mean Change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 by Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) using LOCF Approach – ITT Set 
While the LOCF imputation used for the above sensitivity analyses is not considered conservative for 
the hypothesis of equivalence testing and does therefore not provide strong additional support in 
favour of equivalence, the results of the tipping point analysis indicate that the results are sufficiently 
robust. The results of this tipping point analysis are summarized in Table 17. Results were tipped from 
equivalent to not equivalent only for extreme assumptions such as when the imputed BCVA values 
were made better by at least 10 letters for Eylea and worse by at least 10 letters for MYL-1701P or 
vice versa as well as when the imputed BCVA values were made better by 5 letters for Eylea and worse 
by 15 letters for MYL-1701P. Given the treatment effect profile from observed data and considering 5 
letters constitute one complete line in the ETDRS chart, these imputed values are considered unlikely 
to represent the unmeasured true values, and hence the primary analysis result and the conclusion of 
equivalence of the two treatment arms in the primary endpoint is supported.

Additional Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses to Assess the Impact of COVID-19-Related 
Disruption 
The following additional sensitivity and supplementary analyses were done to assess the impact of 
COVID-19-related disruptions on the primary analysis: 
• 
• 
Primary analysis repeated with COVID-19-related delayed BCVA assessments treated as 
missing [Mean difference (SE): 0.03 (0.736); 95% CI: -1.42, 1.47]. 
Primary analysis repeated without the subjects who are impacted by COVID-19 based on the 3 
criteria defined in the protocol, namely 
o  Missed study drug administration at Visit 4/Week 4 because of the COVID-19 pandemic 
o  Missed BCVA examination for the study eye at Visit 5/Week 8 because of the COVID-19 
pandemic

o  Delayed BCVA examination for the study eye at Visit 5/Week 8 by more than 7 days 
from scheduled visit date because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with scheduled date

 [Analysis of Mean Change in BCVA (letters) from Baseline to Week 8: Adjusted Mean difference 
between the treatment groups: 0.13; 95% CI: -1.32, 1.58] 
•  A tipping point analysis where only non-pandemic related missing data were tipped and

Table 19: Analysis of Mean Change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 by MMRM 
 by Enrolment Period – ITT Analysis Set 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between subjects randomized before 25 
Jan 2020, and subjects randomized on or after 25 Jan 2020, except a considerably lower proportion of 
overall enrolled subjects from the US (23.7% before vs 7.1% on or after 25 Jan 2020), while more 
patients were recruited from the rest of the world (i.e. India: 11.8% before vs 39.4% on or after 25 
Jan 2020). As a likely consequence, the overall proportion of Asian participants increased (24.1% 
before vs 51.2% on or after 25 Jan 2020), but distribution between treatment arms was not affected. 
However, upon analysis of subjects randomized on or after 25 Jan 2020 only, the adjusted mean 
change in BCVA at Week 8 was lower than what would be expected (5.46 and 5.90 in the MYL-1701P 
and Eylea group, respectively). Upon request, the Applicant explained that in previous clinical studies 
the Japanese population also had a lower mean response compared to the overall population after 8 
weeks. In fact, the lower mean change in BCVA in those subgroups points toward geographic and/or 
ethnic differences regarding the treatment effect, even after extended treatment (Week 52) [Terasaki 
H et al 2019]. Nevertheless, in the current study MYL-1701P-3001 the sensitivity to demonstrate 
biosimilarity is not considered compromised, since the distribution of patients from Japan and India 
was balanced between treatment arms in both randomization periods, and since at the timepoint for 
primary assessment (Week 8) the mean change in BCVA has not yet reached the plateau for maximal 
treatment effect. Although the 95% CI of mean treatment difference in subjects randomized on or 
after 25 Jan 2020 [-3.06, 2.18] was slightly outside the equivalence range [-3, +3], no concern 
regarding biosimilarity is raised, as this subgroup was overall considerably smaller and lacks statistical 
precision. 
The 95% CIs for the treatment difference of mean changes from Baseline to Week 8 for BCVA from the 
analysis with COVID-19 related delayed assessments treated as missing data and the analysis without 
the subjects impacted by COVID-19 based on the defined criteria, respectively, were fully contained 
within the interval of [-3, +3] letters and the analyses supported the primary analysis.  
The tipping point analysis where only non-pandemic related missing data were tipped and standard 
missing at random imputation was used for COVID-19 related missing data revealed that no results 
were tipped from equivalent to not equivalent in this case. The most extreme scenarios considered, i.e. 
when the imputed BCVA values were made better by 10 letters or worse by 15 letters for either 
treatment arm, are already considered extremely unrealistic and therefore fully sufficient to support 
robustness of the results with this respect.

Subgroup Analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The Forest plot of all subgroup analyses (ITT analysis) for mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 
8 (Observed Data) with 95% CI is provided in Figure 4. Subgroup analyses for any anti-VEGF therapy 
in fellow eye prior to visit 5/Week 8 (Yes, No) and ADA status (positive, negative) are shown in Table 
20 and Table 21, respectively. 
Overall, the analyses revealed that mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 8 by subgroups 
continues to support equivalence between the treatment arms. In some subgroups, the sample size 
was too small for a meaningful analysis and led to wide CIs, not allowing conclusions on these.  
BCVA at baseline is informative for the room for improvement. A lower magnitude of change from 
baseline may be expected in patients with higher baseline BCVA. Indeed, the adjusted mean change in 
BCVA at Week 8 was lower in the BCVA subgroup 73-55 (6.24 [MYL-1701P] and 6.21 [Eylea]) 
compared to the 54-38 subgroup (7.95 [MYL-1701P] and 7.69 [Eylea]. On the other hand, assessment 
of decreases in visual acuity may be difficult in patients with already low baseline BCVA. Upon request, 
the Applicant provided a separate subgroup analysis for baseline BCVA 50-69, a range which would 
allow sufficient room for improvement or deterioration and which is thus considered more sensitive. 
Importantly, in the most sensitive subgroup of subjects with baseline BCVA 50-69, the treatment effect 
was similar to the primary analysis of the overall study population. The mean treatment difference was 
-0.01 and the 95% CI was [-1.89, 1.86] and therefore within the pre-defined equivalence range of [-3, 
+3] letters. This subgroup was also the largest (114 subjects in MYL-1701P and 106 subjects in Eylea) 
and is therefore considered the most relevant in this biosimilar exercise. Unexpectedly, the BCVA 
change at Week 8 was comparable in magnitude (MYL-1701P: 7.05; Eylea: 6.31) in the highest 
baseline BCVA group of 70-73 compared to the overall population (MYL-1701P: 6.60; Eylea: 6.56). 
Nevertheless, the concern of limited room for improvement is reflected in the key secondary endpoint 
CRT change at Week 8, which was below the expected improvement for this subgroup (MYL-1701P: -
76.67; Eylea: -103.23 vs. overall population: MYL-1701P: -112.15; Eylea: -123.61).  
Finally, a comparably high adjusted mean difference (3.82) was observed in the subgroup of >=75 
year olds. This was mainly driven by an unusually low adjusted mean change in BCVA in the Eylea 
treatment group (3.19). As the subgroup was rather small (n = 13 in each treatment arm) and the 
95% CI as expected very wide, this observation is eventually of no concern.

Table 21: Mean Change in BCVA (ETDRS letters) from Baseline to Week 52 by ADA Status – 
ITT Set 
It appears that neither BCVA change from baseline nor equivalence was compromised by the 
occurrence of ADA. In fact, at Week 8 the mean change from baseline in BCVA was even higher and 
very similar in both treatment arms in the ADA positive subgroup in a descriptive analysis. However, 
due to the rather small subgroup of ADA positive subjects (n = 15 in the MYL-1701P and n = 22 in the 
Eylea arms), these results need to be interpreted with caution. For completeness, subgroup analyses, 
including adjusted mean differences and corresponding CIs, were provided for mean change from 
baseline of BCVA at week 8 and for the key secondary endpoint (mean change from baseline in CRT at 
Week 8). As expected, it was concluded that the occurrence of ADA did not have an impact on efficacy 
or PD aspects of aflibercept. 
Ancillary Analyses for Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The mean change in CRT (ITT analysis) from baseline to week-8 in subgroups (observed data) with 
95% CI is provided in Figure 8. Again, in some subgroups, the sample size was too small for a 
meaningful analysis and led to wide CIs. Yet, biosimilarity is also supported by these analyses, since 
similar results were observed.

CRT = Central Retinal Thickness. Note: For CRT, baseline is defined as the last observation prior to or on the date 
of the first dose of study drug. CRT was measured as central subfield thickness. Change from baseline was analyzed 
using analysis of MMRM. See details of MMRM model in Tables 14.2.2.3.1.1a to 14.2.2.3.1.7a. N/A=Not

Week 8 by Subgroups (Observed Data; 95% CI) – ITT Set 
For mean change from baseline in CRT over time, additional analyses were performed using: 
•  Central reading including indeterminate values - The secondary analysis utilizing the central 
reader CRT values did not consider the values that were flagged as indeterminate. All the SD-
OCT images for the study eye were transmitted to the independent central reading center. The 
central reader reviewed and reported the CRT values. According to their standard operating 
procedures, the central reader would have indicated a CRT value as “indeterminate” in cases 
where the SD-OCT images had some quality issue such as poor segmentation or centering. 
Such “indeterminate” CRT values were recorded in a separate field by the central reader. An 
additional analysis was performed by including such indeterminate values from the central 
reading (Figure 9). 
• 
Investigator assessment – According to final SAP version 3.0, for the analysis of the secondary 
endpoint, mean change from baseline in CRT, only the central reading was considered and, the 
CRT values provided by the Investigators based on their evaluation of the SD-OCT scan images

were not considered. The Investigators independently evaluated the SD-OCT scan images at all 
the visits and recorded the CRT values. An additional analysis was performed utilizing the CRT 
values recorded by the Investigators based on their assessment (Figure 10). 
In these additional analyses, the mean change from baseline in CRT over time was comparable 
between the treatment arms. The results from the additional analyses are comparable with the 
secondary endpoint analysis, further supporting biosimilarity.

In order to assess whether the extra 31 subjects randomized due to COVID-19 criteria could have 
affected any of the outcomes, the Applicant provided results of analyses for the primary and key 
secondary variable including only the number of patients as initially planned, i.e. the first 324 patients 
randomized, upon request. These analyses indicate that the results were similar to the results of all 
355 subjects, confirming that the data of 31 additional subjects did not have an impact on study 
outcomes. Furthermore, the distribution of those extra subjects was balanced between the treatment 
arms (n = 17 in MYL-1701P arm; n = 14 in Eylea arm).

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For the clinical development program to demonstrate biosimilarity of the biosimilar Yesafili (MYL-
1701P; M710) and the reference product US-sourced Eylea, one single pivotal phase 3 study (MYL-
1701P-3001) has been performed.  
Study MYL-1701P-3001 was a multicenter, randomized, double masked, active controlled, comparative 
clinical study to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful differences exist between MYL-1701P and 
US-licensed Eylea regarding efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in subjects with Diabetic Macular 
Edema (DME). No dedicated human PK or PD studies were conducted. Instead, supportive PK analyses 
were conducted in a subset of patients enrolled in MYL-1701P-3001. This strategy was agreed, since 
systemic exposure after intravitreal injection is expected to be low, and due to ethical concerns.  
Study MYL-1701P-3001 enrolled subjects with DME following type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, with 
baseline CRT of ≥300 µm and BCVA at 4 m from 73 to 38 letters (ETDRS chart) equivalent to Snellen 
visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200 in the study eye. Subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who 
present with central DME involvement in the study eye is considered a suitable study population to 
demonstrate clinical equivalence between MYL-1701P and US-Eylea. The variability for mean change in 
BCVA was found to be lower in DME compared to neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration 
(wAMD) based on previous clinical studies of Eylea. The selection of patients with DME as study 
population is agreed. 
It was recommended to include a more impaired and homogeneous patient population regarding 
baseline CRT and BCVA. Nevertheless, the finally selected criteria are similar to registrational clinical 
trials for Eylea (VIVID/VISTA) and considered suitable, with the caveats that assessment of decreases 
in visual acuity may be difficult in legally blind patients, and there may be limited room for 
improvement in subjects with higher BCVA or lower CRT. Similarly, exclusion criteria are by large in 
accordance with registrational clinical trials for Eylea in DME.  
Five consecutive monthly intravitreal injections, followed by bimonthly intravitreal injections of MYL-
1701P and US-Eylea were planned until end of study at Week 52. Hence, treatment with biosimilar 
MYL-1701P and the originator Eylea were in line with the SmPC of Eylea for DME treatment. The use of 
US-sourced Eylea as reference product is acceptable, as robust equivalence was demonstrated on the 
quality level. The study duration (52 weeks) is considered long enough to investigate the efficacy and 
safety profile of the product. 
The primary endpoint, BCVA as assessed by ETDRS letters at Week 8, is suitable to demonstrate 
equivalence of clinical efficacy in patients with DME. The mean change from baseline in BCVA is 
considered a sufficiently sensitive endpoint that allows detection of the product-related differences. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 67/104 
 
 
 
 
primary endpoint BCVA, measured using the ETDRS charts, is a validated and continuous metric which 
captures macular function well and is a suitable outcome measure. An early 2-month (8 weeks) time 
point is considered sensitive to detect eventual differences between the treatments and also minimizes 
the impact of potential confounding factors occurring later in the study. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint, mean change in CRT determined by SD-OCT over time, is 
considered adequate to reflect PD aspects of aflibercept. Other secondary efficacy endpoints aim to 
assess the maintenance of efficacy over time and are endorsed. 
For the primary endpoint assessment, the predefined and accepted equivalence range to demonstrate 
biosimilarity was -3 to +3 letters. No equivalence range was defined for secondary endpoints. From a 
methodological perspective, the overall approach on the primary analyses and sensitivity analyses is 
considered adequate. Some additional analyses were requested to further support robustness of the 
results. Consequently, the Applicant provided analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints 
including only the number of patients initially planned, to ensure that the additionally recruited 
patients based on decisions during the study on missed/delayed dosing and/or study assessments 
because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (as per protocol V 3.0) did not affect 
any of the outcomes. This ensured that the recruitment was not motivated by data-driven decisions 
that may have impacted the study interpretation. In addition and due to an inadequately chosen 
missing data handling strategy, the Applicant provided additional analyses on the secondary endpoint 
of the proportion of patients who gained or lost a letter.  
In total, 355 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive MYL-1701P or Eylea. No patients discontinued 
the study due to any of the pre-specified COVID-19 criteria (Protocol Version 3.0). In general, protocol 
amendments were made to address the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to facilitate 
recruitment or to meet local legal requirements, which is considered appropriate to ensure conduct of 
the study. 
Overall, the Applicant’s clinical development program to demonstrate biosimilarity between MYL-1701P 
and US-Eylea with respect to efficacy is considered adequate to support this Application. The study 
design, study population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and dose regimen were selected based on 
registrational studies for Eylea, are in line with the guidance on similar biological products, and were 
largely in compliance with Scientific Advice obtained. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary assessment was presented for the ITT and PP analysis sets, which are considered equally 
important for the demonstration of biosimilarity by the Rapporteur. Although the Applicant presented 
the PP analysis set in the section Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Endpoint, all relevant data were 
available and appropriately summarized for assessment. An additional analysis on the FAS was also 
presented, but this comprised the same set of patients with available values at the timepoint of the 
primary analysis and results were identical to the ITT analysis. In this analysis, missing values were 
addressed by using an MMRM. 
In the ITT Set, the primary endpoint mean (SE) change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 was 6.60 
(0.548) and 6.56 (0.548) in the MYL-1701P and Eylea group, respectively. In both treatment groups, 
the effect size was what would be expected after treatment with aflibercept. The adjusted mean 
difference between the treatment groups was 0.04 and the 95% CI for the treatment difference was [-
1.40, 1.47], which is within the predefined and accepted equivalence range of -3 to +3 letters.  
In the PP Set, the mean (SE) change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 8 was 6.61 (0.556) and 6.80 
(0.565) in the MYL-1701P and Eylea group, respectively. The adjusted mean difference was -0.19 and 
the 95% CI for the treatment difference was [-1.66, 1.27], which is also within the predefined and 
Assessment report

Page 68/104 
 
 
 
accepted equivalence range of -3 to +3 letters. Thus, biosimilarity was demonstrated for the primary 
endpoint in the ITT and PP Analysis Sets. 
To assess PD aspects of aflibercept, mean change in CRT over time was assessed as key secondary 
efficacy endpoint. At Week 8 mean (SE) change in CRT was -112.15 (6.742) µm and -123.61 (6.807) 
µm in the MYL-1701P and Eylea group, respectively. Again, in both treatment groups the change from 
baseline was what would be expected after treatment with aflibercept. Yet, the improvement was 
slightly more pronounced in the Eylea group, with an adjusted mean difference (SE) of 11.46 (8.986) 
µm. While an equivalence range was not defined for CRT, the 95% CI [-6.22 µm, 29.14 µm] indicated 
that there does not seem to be a relevant difference between the treatment groups. A difference of up 
to 50 µm is considered not clinically relevant, since in the present and other studies investigating anti-
VEGF agents, an increase in CRT by ≥ 50 µm is defined as clinically relevant to trigger additional 
dosing. Hence, the observed minimally better improvement in the Eylea group (11.46 µm), as well as 
the estimated upper limit of the 95% CI (29.14 µm) are considered clearly below the established 
boundary for retreatment and therefore these changes are considered clinically irrelevant. Mean 
change in CRT throughout the entire study duration indicated an increase of improvement in both 
study arms over time. Overall, differences between study arms are considered small, as those are 
clearly below 50 µm, a change in CRT that would be considered clinically relevant. Hence, biosimilarity 
is supported by the results in this key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Other secondary endpoints included the mean change in BCVA over time up to Week 52 and the 
proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters at Week 52, both of which showed similar responses 
between both treatment groups, further supporting biosimilarity. 
Per study protocol a total of nine injections were planned to be administered for the entire study 
duration of 52 weeks, with the option of receiving additional four doses upon worsening of BCVA or 
CRT. Although the median number of doses received was indeed nine injections in both treatment 
arms, the median of discrete numbers is an insensitive metric, and indeed only 56.3% of all patients 
received nine doses. Reassuringly, upon request it was clarified that only few of those patients 
received additional doses due to worsening of their condition, since the majority of patients who 
received 9 doses have not received any additional dose (95%). Of note, more patients (ITT set) in the 
MYL-1701P arm received additional doses of aflibercept (30.3%) compared to subjects receiving Eylea 
(23.9%), which is partially attributed to more optional doses received after a missed planned dose in 
patients in the MYL-1701P arm, rather than worsening of their condition. A slightly higher proportion of 
subjects in the Eylea arm received less than 9 planned doses. Reassuringly, analyses of BCVA and CRT 
over time on the ITT and PP sets support the conclusion that missed and/or additional doses had no 
relevant impact on efficacy. 
To account for missing BCVA values, sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint. The 
95% CI for the adjusted mean differences between the two treatments from sensitivity analyses 
excluding BCVA values after discontinuing study medication (ITT Set) and replacing missing BCVA 
values by LOCF approach using the ANCOVA model (ITT Set) were similar to the primary outcome and 
well within the predefined equivalence range [-3, +3]. While the LOCF is not considered conservative 
for the hypothesis of equivalence testing and does therefore not provide strong additional support in 
favour of equivalence, the results of the tipping point analysis indicate that the results are sufficiently 
robust, since only extremely unfavourable and unrealistic assumptions for the missing values would tip 
the results towards non-equivalence, which is not considered a likely scenario for the unknown true 
values and therefore these results support robustness of the primary endpoint analysis and the 
conclusion on equivalence. Upon request, the Applicant also performed an additional analysis on the 
secondary endpoint “proportion of subjects who gained or lost letters” with an alternative imputation 
technique that utilized a multiple imputation method, indicating robustness of the results.

Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of disruptions related to COVID-19. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between subjects randomized before 25 
Jan 2020, and subjects randomized on or after 25 Jan 2020, except a considerably lower proportion of 
overall enrolled subjects from the US (23.7% before vs 7.1% on or after 25 Jan 2020), while more 
patients were recruited from the rest of the world (i.e. India: 11.8% before vs 39.4% on or after 25 
Jan 2020). As a likely consequence, the overall proportion of Asian participants increased (24.1% 
before vs 51.2% on or after 25 Jan 2020), but distribution between treatment arms was not affected. 
Primary assessments considering COVID-19 related disruptions, such as missed or delayed 
examinations, showed that the 95% CI for the treatment difference was fully contained within the 
equivalence range [-3, +3]. However, upon analysis of subjects randomized on or after 25 Jan 2020 
only, mean treatment difference was -0.44 and the 95% CI was [-3.06, 2.18]. Notably, the adjusted 
mean change in BCVA at Week 8 was lower than what would be expected (5.46 and 5.90 in the MYL-
1701P and Eylea group, respectively). Upon request, the Applicant attributed this difference to an 
overall lower mean response previously reported in the Japanese population [Terasaki H et al 2019]. 
The sensitivity to demonstrate biosimilarity is not considered compromised in this subgroup, since the 
distribution of Asian patients was balanced between treatment arms in both randomization periods, 
and since at the timepoint for primary assessment (Week 8) the mean change in BCVA has not yet 
reached the plateau for maximal treatment effect.  
Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint supported equivalence between treatment arms, 
when the sample size was > 60 patients per group. In subgroup analyses with fewer subjects, 95% CIs 
were wider and not entirely contained within the equivalence range. Nevertheless, as the sample sizes 
were small and similar trends to the main analysis were observed, biosimilarity would still be 
supported.  
At baseline, the majority (53.5%) of patients had BCVA of 65 or higher. As highlighted earlier, there 
may be limited room for improvement in patients with high BCVA and hence ceiling effects may affect 
assessment of biosimilarity. Indeed, the adjusted mean change in BCVA at Week 8 was lower in the 
BCVA subgroup 73-55 (6.24 [MYL-1701P] and 6.21 [Eylea]) compared to the 54-38 subgroup (7.95 
[MYL-1701P] and 7.69 [Eylea]). On the other hand, assessment of decreases in visual acuity may be 
difficult in patients with already low baseline BCVA. Upon request, the Applicant showed a separate 
subgroup analysis for baseline BCVA 50-69, which would have been the preferred range, comprising a 
more heterogeneous and impaired population, which allows sufficient room for improvement or 
deterioration and is thus considered more sensitive. In this subgroup, the treatment effect was similar 
to the primary analysis of the overall study population. The mean treatment difference was -0.01 and 
the 95% CI was [-1.89, 1.86] and therefore within the pre-defined equivalence range of [-3, +3] 
letters. This subgroup was also the largest (114 subjects in MYL-1701P and 106 subjects in Eylea) and 
is therefore considered the most relevant in this biosimilar exercise. 
It appears that neither the BCVA change from baseline nor equivalence was compromised by the 
occurrence of ADA. In fact, at Week 8 the mean change from baseline in BCVA was even higher and 
very similar in both treatment arms in the ADA positive subgroup. Likewise, no effect of ADA on PD 
aspects of aflibercept was observed, as mean change from baseline in CRT at Week 8 was also similar. 
As would be expected due to low sample sizes, subgroup analyses for the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint (mean change in CRT at Week 8) resulted in wider 95% CIs compared to the main analysis. 
Yet, biosimilarity is supported since similar trends were observed. 
Taken together, efficacy data show that MYL-1701P and US-Eylea can be regarded as equivalently 
efficacious based on pre-specified criteria of the primary endpoint. Biosimilarity is also supported by 
secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses.

Extrapolation of indications 
In the EU, the reference product Eylea (aflibercept) is approved for treatment of wAMD, RVO, DME and 
myopic CNV in adults. The Applicant selected DME for the single phase 3 pivotal study (MYL-1701P-
3001) and plans to obtain approval for DME and all other adults indications of Eylea, based on similar 
pathogenic mechanisms. The pathogenesis of all approved adults indications involves angiogenesis 
mediated by the members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors, and the mechanism of action of 
aflibercept in DME is considered representative of the mechanism of action of aflibercept in all other 
adults approved indications for Eylea.  
The justification presented by the Applicant to allow extrapolation from DME to all approved adults 
indications of Eylea is considered adequate, as analytical and clinical biosimilarity could be established. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From an efficacy perspective, the clinical data suggest similarity between biosimilar Yesafili (MYL-
1701P; M710) and the reference product US-Eylea. 
2.4.7.  Clinical safety 
Safety Profile of the Reference Product Eylea 
A complete overview of the undesirable effects of Eylea can be found in the Eylea SmPC. 
Adverse events of particular concern include but are not limited to: 
• 
• 
• 
Endophthalmitis and retinal detachment following intravitreal injections: In such an event, 
subject was instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal 
detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. 
Increases in intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection. 
Potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving Eylea were conjunctival 
hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous floaters, intraocular pressure increased, and vitreous 
detachment. 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea/MYL-1701P. In 
registrational studies for Eylea (VIVID/VISTA) the incidence of pre-treatment immunoreactivity to 
VEGF Trap was approximately 1%-2.4% and the incidence of treatment-emergent immunoreactivity 
was approximately 1% at Week 52. Neutralizing antibodies occurred in 0.3-0.4%.  
For any potential allergic reaction after administration of study drug, diagnosis and assessment of 
anaphylaxis was done using National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the Food Allergy 
and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria of anaphylaxis. 
Biosimilar MYL-1701P (M710) 
All safety data for the biosimilar MYL-1701P (M710) are derived from pivotal phase 3 study MYL-
1701P-3001, a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, comparative clinical study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MYL-1701P and reference product US-Eylea in subjects with 
diabetic macular edema.  
Considering the study dosed MYL-1701P for the first time in human subjects, a Sentinel Cohort Data 
Review Committee (SCDRC) was established for the safety evaluation of subjects enrolled into a 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 71/104 
 
 
 
sentinel cohort. The sentinel cohort included 9 subjects, with at least 3 subjects receiving MYL-1701P. 
The study was to be continued only if no safety concerns arose from the sentinel cohort within the first 
week of dosing. 
Safety variables in study MYL-1701P-3001: 
Safety and tolerability were assessed over time which included ocular and non-ocular AEs, physical 
examination findings, ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory tests evaluated at pre-
specified time points (Table 23). Ocular safety was assessed using BCVA, SD-OCT, FA / FP, and 
complete ophthalmic examinations at pre-specified time points (Table 23). 
Incidence, titer and neutralizing capacity of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) were assessed as:  
•  Treatment induced ADA: ADA developed any time after the initiation of drug administration 
in a subject without pre-existing ADA. 
•  Treatment boosted ADA: any time after the initiation of drug administration the ADA titer 
was at least 4 times the baseline titer in a subject who had a pre-existing ADA at baseline.

2.4.7.1.  Patient exposure 
Based on the review of data package of the first 9 subjects in the sentinel cohort, the SCDRC did not 
find any significant safety concern and concluded with consensus among committee members to 
continue recruitment. 
Patient Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
Please refer to Section Results –. Participant flow and Baseline data for details. 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
Overall, 354 subjects (178 in the MYL-1701P arm and 176 in the Eylea arm), received study treatment. 
The median treatment duration was 364 days in both study arms. The mean (SD) number of doses 
received in each of the treatment arms was similar [8.4 (2.06) in MYL-1701P arm and 8.7 (1.76) in 
Eylea arm]. For more details see Table 3. 
There were no dosing errors (such as wrong study drug treatment received) reported in this study. Of 
355 randomized subjects, one subject randomized to the MYL-1701P arm withdrew consent to 
participate before receiving a dose of the study drug, and was therefore not included in the safety 
analysis set. 
Safety analysis set (Safety Set) 
The safety analysis set consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects 
were included in the analysis according to the actual treatment received. The safety analysis set was 
the primary analysis set for safety analyses.

Table 24: Summary of Treatment Duration, Exposure to Study  
Medication and up to Week 52 – Safety Set 
Out of 96 subjects, 54 (30.3%) subjects in MYL-1701P arm and 42 (23.9%) subjects in Eylea arm 
received at least one additional optional dose of the study drug. Proportions of subjects receiving > 9 
planned injections are discussed in Section Results – Outcomes and estimation (see Other Secondary 
Efficacy Parameters). 
2.4.7.2.  Adverse events 
The provided safety database is considered sufficient to assess the comparability of common (≥1/100 
to <1/10) and very common (≥1/10) adverse events. However, it is too small to inform on less 
frequently occurring adverse events. This approach is considered adequate for biosimilar development. 
TEAEs overall 
For an overall summary of AE see Table 25. TEAE leading to discontinuation are summarized in detail 
in Table 42. The overall incidence of TEAE was comparable between the study arms. More subjects 
experienced at least one related TEAE in the Eylea arm [12/176 (6.8%)] compared to MYL-1701P 
[5/178 (2.8%)]. Similarly, 3/176 (1.7%) experienced a related serious TEAE in the Eylea arm 
compared to zero in the MYL-1701P group. Yet, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 74/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 6 subjects experienced TEAEs leading to death during the study; 2 (1.1%) subjects in the 
MYL-1701P arm and 4 (2.3%) subjects in the Eylea arm. All deaths occurring during the study are 
described in detail and discussed in Section 2.4.7.3. 
Table 25: Overall Summary of Adverse Events – Safety Set 
A summary of non-ocular TEAEs by SOC and PT that were reported for ≥2% of the subjects by PT in 
either arm is provided in Table 26.  
Non-ocular TEAEs were overall comparable between the treatment groups. However, more subjects 
treated with MYL-1701P reported SOC infections and infestations [55/178 (30.9%)] compared to 
subjects in the Eylea group [41/176 (23.3%)]. The following corresponding PTs were reported in 
higher incidence in MYL-1701P arm than in Eylea arm: nasopharyngitis (7.9% vs 5.7%), sinusitis 
(2.2% vs 1.1%), bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia (in each 2.2% vs 0.6%), respiratory tract 
infection (1.1% vs 0%). In addition, PTs pyrexia was reported in 3.9% in MYL-1701P arm compared to 
1.7% in Eylea arm and cough was reported in 3.4% (MYL-1701P) vs 0.6% (Eylea), which could 
indicate the higher incidence in the risk of (especially respiratory tract) infections. No ADRs related to 
the respiratory system are stated in section 4.8 of provided SmPC or in SmPC of Eylea. Upon request, 
the Applicant provided more details on the occurrence of higher incidence of reported infections in the 
MYL-1701P arm. All reported events were assessed as not related. Most events were mild or moderate 
in severity. Only 2 events (2.8%) were severe (1 in MYL-1701P arm and 1 in Eylea arm), and 2 (2.8%) 
were fatal (both in Eylea arm). A severe case in the MYL-1701P arm was PT Covid-19 pneumonia (also 
assessed as not related to a study drug).  
Additionally, more subjects treated with MYL-1701P reported TEAE peripheral swelling assigned to the 
SOC General disorders & administration site conditions (2.8%) compared to subjects in the Eylea arm 
(0%). Upon request, more details were provided. Four (4) of them had swelling in lower extremities 
and 1 subject reported swelling of upper extremity. All the observed events were considered not 
related to a study drug by investigators. The severity was mild to moderate. No pattern in time to 
onset could be identified.  
Finally, more subjects treated with MYL-1701P reported TEAEs of fall assigned to the SOC Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications (3.9%) compared to subjects in the Eylea arm (0.6%). Upon 
request, more details were provided. All events were considered not related to IP by the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 75/104 
 
 
 
 
None of these events led to any interruption in the treatment schedule or drug discontinuation. All the 
events (falls) were resolved on the same day of onset. The severity was mild (4x) or moderate (3x). 
Two (2) subjects in MYL-1701P arm had a history of similar events. Applicant stated that visual acuity 
was maintained at the time of the fall indicating that the fall was not due to low vision.  
Overall, the imbalance in non-ocular TEAEs observed between the treatment arms was not considered 
to impact the conclusion on similar safety, as those were mostly mild to moderate in severity, not 
related to study drug and concerned few patients. 
Apart from those, the most frequently reported non-ocular TEAEs by PT were hypertension reported by 
36 (10.2%) subjects (16 [9.0%] in MYL-1701P and 20 [11.4%] in Eylea arm); urinary tract infection 
reported by 15 (4.2%) subjects (7 [3.9%] in MYL-17101P arm and 8 [4.5%] in the Eylea arm).  
Those events were reported in both groups at similar frequencies and no further concerns arise from 
these findings.

Table 26: Non-Ocular TEAEs by SOC and PT (≥2% of the subjects by PT) 
 – Safety Set 
A summary of ocular TEAEs by SOC and PT that were reported for ≥2% of the subjects by PT in either 
arm is provided in Table 27.  
Overall, the most frequently reported ocular TEAEs by PT were cataract, reported by 17 (4.8%) 
subjects (11 [6.2%] in MYL-1701P arm and 6 [3.4%] in Eylea arm); conjunctival haemorrhage, 
reported by 13 (3.7%) subjects (6 [3.4%] in MYL-1701P and 7 [4.0%] in Eylea arm); and IOP 
increased reported by 9 (2.5%) subjects (4 [2.2%] in MYL-1701P and 5 [2.8%] in Eylea arm). Hence, 
the eye disorder cataract was reported more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm, but the higher reported 
incidence of medical history of cataract in MYL-1701P arm (42.5% vs 35.8%) could have an impact on 
the observed higher incidence during the study. In contrast, other ocular TEAEs by PT were more 
frequently observed in the Eylea arm. The observed ocular TEAEs are listed ADR in the Eylea SmPC

and therefore within the expected safety profile of Eylea and overall comparable between treatment 
arms.

– Safety Set 
A tabular summary of intensity/severity of TEAEs in both the treatment arms for safety population 
is provided in Table 28.  
The severity of non-ocular and ocular TEAEs was comparable between treatment arms. The majority of 
ocular TEAEs were mild [in 80/354 (22.6%) of subjects in the study eye] to moderate [in 23/354 
(6.5%) of subjects in the study eye]. In the study eye, severe ocular TEAEs were reported in one 
(0.6%) subject (PT: posterior capsule opacification) in the MYL-1701P arm and 3 (1.7%) subjects 
(PTs: macular hole, and vitreous detachment, vitreous detachment, cataract) in the Eylea arm. No 
ocular life-threatening ocular TEAEs were reported.  
There were no subjects in the MYL-1701P arm and 2 (1.1%) subjects in the Eylea arm who reported 
life threatening event and 2 (1.1%) subjects in MYL-1701P arm and 4 (2.3%) subjects in Eylea arm 
died. All deaths occurring during the study are described in detail and discussed in Section 2.4.7.3.

Description 
For example: the temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the adverse event (AE) onset/course is reasonable, there is 
a clinically compatible response to de-challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; 
the event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re-challenge 
procedure if necessary. 
For example: the temporal relationship between drug 
exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a 
clinically compatible response to 
de-challenge (re-challenge is not required), and other causes 
have been eliminated or are unlikely. 
For example: the temporal relationship 
between study treatment exposure and the AE onset/course is 
reasonable or unknown, de-challenge information is either 
unknown or equivocal; could also be explained by disease or 
other drugs. 
Another explanation is more likely such as disease, 
environment, or other medication. 
Does not represent a known reaction to study drug. 
The temporal relationship between drug exposure and the AE 
onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal 
relationship to study drug is impossible

The majority of TEAEs were considered not related [in 231/354 (65.3%) of subjects] or unlikely 
[28/354 (7.9%) of subjects] related to study drug and there were no notable differences in frequencies 
between the treatment arms. All the definitely related TEAEs were ocular TEAEs in study eye. Most of 
those are known undesirable effects of Eylea (SmPC), except papilledema, which occurred in the MYL-
1701P treatment arm. This was a single AE of moderate severity, which occurred eight days after the 
first dose of MYL-1701P. The event of papilledema resolved following treatment with cetirizine, topical 
dexamethasone and topical nepafenac. The patient did not receive any further doses of study drug and 
was withdrawn from the study. Since this was an isolated event, no concern regarding a similar safety 
profile of Eylea and MYL-1701P is raised.  
Non-ocular TEAEs that were possibly related to the study drugs were cardiac arrest, embolic stroke 
(one subject) and brain stem infarction (one subject) in the Eylea arm. Those events are Adverse 
Events of Interest and are discussed in the next section. 
Table 30: TEAEs by Maximum Relationship to Study Drug – Safety Set 
A summary of the drug related TEAEs by SOC and PT (≥2 Subjects by PT) is provided in the Table 
31.  
The frequency of drug related TEAEs (≥ 2 subjects by PT) was higher in Eylea treated subjects [12/176 
(6.8%)] compared to the MYL-1701P arm [5/178 (2.8%)]. Those events are known undesirable effects 
of Eylea (SmPC), and appear to be less common in the MYL-1701P arm. 
Table 31: Summary of Drug Related TEAEs by SOC and PT (≥2 Subjects by PT)  
– Safety Set 
In conclusion, the overall safety profile appears acceptable and comparable in both treatment arms. 
Adverse Events of Interest 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) have been reported as adverse events of interest, 
since there is a theoretical risk of cardiovascular effects upon systemic anti-VEGF treatment. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 80/104 
 
 
 
 
 
masked independent MACE adjudication committee reviewed potential cardiovascular events occurring 
in the MYL-1701P-3001 study. A total of 45 TEAEs required full committee adjudication. Of those, nine 
events (Table 32) were classified as MACE and occurred in seven subjects (2 (1.1%) subjects in MYL-
1701P arm vs 5 (2.8%) subjects in Eylea arm). Hence, more MACE occurred in the Eylea arm. Of 
those, each one event of cardiac arrest, embolic stroke (one subject) and brain stem infarction (one 
subject) in the Eylea arm were classified possibly related to the study drug. Although cardiac arrest 
and embolic stroke in one subject were considered non-fatal, the subject died after withdrawal from 
study. 
The higher frequency of MACE in the Eylea group may suggest higher systemic aflibercept 
concentrations, which may impact the conclusion on biosimilarity between MYL-1701P and Eylea. In 
the PK subset, the maximum concentration of systemic aflibercept was indeed considerably higher in 
the Eylea arm (244.30 ng/ml) compared to MYL-1701P (108.40 ng/ml). The observed maximum 
concentration of systemic Eylea (244.30 ng/ml) was measured at V2 in a single patient (no MACE 
observed), and decreased to 15.47 ng/ml by V7A, which was below the overall mean concentration at 
that time point (Listing 16.2.9.5b), and is therefore of no concern. Of the patients experiencing a 
MACE, one subject was included in the PK subset, and had a maximum Eylea concentration of 69.95 
ng/ml at V2, which decreased below the limit of detection at V7. Hence, elevated systemic aflibercept 
concentrations do not appear to be a safety concern regarding MACE. 
Table 32: Summary of Adverse Events Categorised as MACE Events  
A summary of ocular injection procedure related TEAEs by SOC and PT (≥2% of the subjects by 
PT) is provided in Table 33.  
Although a higher incidence of any ocular injection procedure related TEAEs was observed in the MYL-
1701P arm (14.6% vs 11.4%), reported TEAEs (≥2% of the subjects by PT) do not show any 
differences in comparison to the Eylea arm and were in line with known undesirable effects of Eylea 
(SmPC). Thus, the safety regarding the ocular injection TEAEs is considered to be similar between both 
treatment arms.

(≥2 % of the subjects by PT) – Safety Set 
One event related to ocular inflammation was reported by one subject from Eylea arm (“eye 
inflammation”). The event was a mild (Grade-1) non-serious adverse event assessed by the Principal 
Investigator as possibly related to the study drug and the treatment was temporarily interrupted 
because of this event. The event resolved after 51 days. This subject did not test positive for ADA 
during any of the study visits. There were no events of endophthalmitis reported in the study. 
2.4.7.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Definition 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•  Results in death. 
• 
Is life-threatening. 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
• 
• 
Is a congenital anomaly. 
Is an important medical event. 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
Serious TEAEs 
An overview of serious TEAEs reported for ≥1% subjects by PT in either treatment arm is presented in 
Table 34.  
Overall, there were more subjects with serious TEAE for MYL-1701P [31/178 (17.4%)] compared to 
Eylea [23/176 (13.1%)]. Numerically the highest difference was reported for PT infections and 
infestations.  Similar to overall non-ocular TEAEs and as discussed above, as these events had different 
origins, no single type of infection could be identified. Hence, the overall higher incidence of PT 
infections and infestations in the MYL-1701P group (7.3% vs 3.4% in the Eylea group) may be a 
chance finding. Similarly, as most serious TEAE were reported in both groups and at low numbers per 
PT it is difficult to draw any final conclusions. With the available data, the overall safety profile seems 
acceptable and comparable in both treatment arms.

Table 34: Serious TEAEs by SOC and PT (≥1% of the subjects by PT)  
– Safety Set 
There were 3 (0.8%) serious ocular TEAE in the study eye reported in 3 subjects: 1 (0.6%) subject in 
the MYL-1701P arm and 2 (1.1%) subjects in the Eylea arm. The events were one incidence of ‘eye 
haemorrhage’ in the MYL-1701P and one incidence of ‘corneal oedema’ and one incidence of ‘vitreous 
detachment’ in the Eylea arm, which was considered not related to the study drug by the Investigator 
(Table 35). It remains unclear whether the other reported serious ocular TEAEs were considered 
related or not related to the study drug. Regardless, these events are known undesirable effects of 
Eylea and the frequency in both study arms is comparable. No serious ocular TEAE was reported in the 
fellow eye.

Deaths 
Overall, 6 subjects experienced TEAEs leading to death during the study; two in MYL-1701P arm and 
four in Eylea arm. Narratives for all patients have been provided by the Applicant. 
In MYL-1701P arm, one subject reported serious TEAEs acute coronary syndrome (not related) and 
Covid-19 infection (not related) which led to death; one subject died due to unknown cause (not 
related). In the Eylea arm, one subject died due to pneumonia (not related); one subject died due to 
myocardial infarction (not related); one subject died due to COVID-19 pneumonia (not related). One 
death in Eylea arm the cause of which was unknown as no autopsy was done. The subject was 
withdrawn from the study earlier because of other Grade 4 SAEs, embolic stroke (possibly related) and 
cardiac arrest (possibly related). The event ‘death’ (not related) was reported after the protocol 
specified safety follow-up period had elapsed post ET visit.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 83/104 
 
 
 
 
 
All the events leading to death were considered not related to the study drug by the Investigator, 
which can be followed. All patients had prior/concomitant co-morbidities and two subjects died from 
COVID19 infections. No concerns regarding aflibercept treatment arise from these fatal events. 
2.4.7.4.  Laboratory findings 
No trends towards significant increase or significant decrease in mean values over time were seen for 
any of the laboratory parameters (hematology and serum chemistry) in either treatment arm.  
Mean HbA1c was generally stable across the study in both study arms. Few subjects who had ‘
normal’ (values less than 6.5%) HbA1c at baseline shifted to ‘high’ values (values ≥ 6.5%) at 
Week 52 in both arms (4.6% in MYL-1701P arm compared to 6.1% in Eylea arm). 
There were no specific trends towards abnormal values of urinalysis parameters in either study arms. 
There were no pregnancies reported during the study. 
There were minimal changes in vital signs parameters [pulse (beats/min), body temperature (ºC), 
systolic blood pressure (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)] across study with no differences 
or trends observed between the two study arms. 
No clinically meaningful trends were noted between baseline and Week 52 for any of the recorded ECG 
parameters [including QT, QTc (Fridericia’s), heart rate (HR), QRS duration, PR and RR interval] 
between the study arms. 
A summary of the ECG interpretation has been provided in Table 36. Abnormal ECG interpretation was 
observed more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm throughout the study duration, but was considered 
not clinically significant (NCS) in the majority of subjects. Furthermore, the proportion of subjects with 
ECG NCS abnormal was below the proportion at baseline from Week 24 onward. Clinically significant 
abnormal ECG was observed in similar proportions of subjects between the study arms throughout the 
study duration.

Ophthalmological Examinations 
Ophthalmological examination included intraocular pressure (IOP), indirect ophthalmoscopy, and slit 
lamp biomicroscopy. All analyses were performed for the study eye as well as for the fellow eye. 
IOP was measured from baseline through Week 52 (Visit 16), and at each visit twice (pre-dose, post-
dose) whenever a dose was administered (see Table 37). Pre- and post-dose mean values as well as 
mean differences pre- and post-dose were similar between study arms. 
There were 9 events of increased IOP experienced by 4 (2.2%) subjects in MYL-1701P arm as 
compared to 12 events experienced by 3 (1.7%) subjects in the Eylea arm (Table 40, Section 2.4.7.2. 
Adverse Events). Other than these, there were no significant differences in mean post-dose IOP values 
between the two treatment arms. IOP is a known common (≥1/100 to <1/10) undesirable effect of 
Eylea, and hence the incidence in both study arms was in line with the expected safety profile.

All clinically significant abnormal findings of indirect ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp biomicroscopy 
examination during the study were reported as AEs, which is considered appropriate. 
2.4.7.5.  Immunological events 
ADA assessment approach 
The Applicant has adopted a three-tiered ECL-based set of bridging assay format to screen, confirm 
and quantify aflibercept specific antibodies in human serum matrix. In brief, serum samples are 
acidified and neutralised before interacting with biotinylated- and sulfo-tagged - aflibercept. ECL 
measurement is performed with a Meso QuickPlex SQ 120 reader in duplicates on BSA blocked plates 
after addition of MSD Gold Read Buffer A. A polyclonal rabbit immune response spiked into pooled 
negative serum is used as positive control. All critical reagents, drugs, matrices and antibodies and 
used lot numbers were well described. The assay was validated for its precision, specificity, selectivity, 
cross-reactivity, and robustness. Intra- and inter-assay precision were both below 10%. Screening and 
confirmatory-assay sensitivities were 5 and 18ng/ml respectively. Cut points for the screening, 
confirmation and titer assay were estimated in 48 naïve pre-dose samples at respective error rates of 
5, 1 and 1%. The negative control serum pool consisted of 80 healthy individuals and was spiked with 
a polyclonal rabbit antibody at three concentration levels of 23, 100 and 1000ng/ml to serve as 
positive control. Antigenic equivalence to US-Eylea was demonstrated, and the absence of a prozone 
effect was confirmed for antibody levels up to 50µg/ml. Benchtop and freeze-thaw sample stability, as 
well as drug tolerance up to 10µg/ml were confirmed. The assay was tolerant to haemolytic and 
lipemic samples and to VEGF levels up to 50ng/ml and. Taken together, the adopted three-tiered 
approach for determination of ADAs was well described and developed. It is considered state of the art 
and valid for its intended use.  
Assessment of Neutralising antibodies 
The Applicant presented a qualitative assay for detection of neutralising ADA’s. In brief, acidified serum 
samples are incubated in microtiter plates with immobilised aflibercept, and simultaneously 
neutralised. Drug specific antibodies are eluted - again under acid conditions - after washing. The 
Applicant justified that induced drug specific antibodies retained their functionality after both acid 
treatment steps. They are transferred into a chemiluminescence plate, where they interact with sulfo-
tagged aflibercept, with and without the competitor VEGF. Chemiluminescent detection is performed 
with a Meso QucikPlex SQ 120 reader in presence of MSD Gold Read buffer A. The presence of 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) against aflibercept is reflected by assay signal inhibition in the presence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 86/104 
 
 
 
 
VEGF, the target ligand of aflibercept. Two cut points were determined: Run specific detection cut point 
(5% false-positive error rate) is defined as the minimum level of response required for a sample to be 
evaluated for NAb positivity using the Percent Inhibition Cut Point (1% false-positive error rate), which 
corresponds to level of signal reduction after addition of excess VEGF in solution, at and above which 
the sample is considered NAb positive. All critical reagents, drugs, matrices and antibodies including lot 
numbers were well described. The assay was validated for its precision, sensitivity, specificity, 
selectivity, cross-reactivity, and robustness. Intra- and inter-assay precision were both below 10%. 
Sensitivities for sample evaluation and confirmed positivity corresponded to 8 and 18 ng/ml, 
respectively. A serum pool of 20 non-reactive individuals served as negative control, and was spiked 
with a murine monoclonal anti-aflibercept antibody with neutralising potential at 20, 200 and 
2000ng/ml as positive control. Cut points for evaluation and confirmed neutralising potential were 
estimated in 30 naïve pre-dose samples at respective error rates of 5 and 1%. Benchtop and freeze-
thaw sample stability, and drug tolerance up to 10µg/ml were confirmed for MYL-1701P and Eylea. 
Specificity was demonstrated using an irrelevant antibody(anti-orentia) at 2µg/ml. The assay was 
tolerant to haemolytic or lipemic samples and to Avastin, Lucentis and VEGF levels up to 4000, 200 
and 10ng/ml, respectively. The absence of a prozone effect was observed for antibody levels up to 
50µg/ml, and bridging to a different lot of biotinylated aflibercept did not impact on the assay readout. 
Taken together, presented assay for determination of neutralising properties was well described and 
established. It measures a reduction of binding to the target VEGF and thus reflects the mechanism of 
action of the drug which mediates its clinical effect. The assay is considered highly relevant, was setup 
correctly and fully validated. Thus, it is considered valid for its intended use. 
Immunogenicity 
The summary of incidence of ADA and NAb by Visit and by overall, in safety analysis set is provided in 
Table 38 and Table 39 (overall ADA and NAb incidence: sum of both treatment induced and treatment 
boosted ADA-positive patients as a proportion of the evaluable patient population). 
At baseline, similar proportions of patients were positive for ADA: 17/178 (9.6%) of subjects in the 
MYL-1701P group compared to 18/176 (10.2%) in the Eylea group. One subject was positive for NAb 
(MYL-1701P group). The overall incidence of ADA positive subjects at baseline was higher compared to 
what was observed in registrational Eylea studies (VIVID/VISTA), which may be explained by different 
sensitivity and specificity of the assays used. Importantly, the incidence of ADA during the present 
study was similar between MYL-1701P and Eylea, supporting biosimilarity.  
The overall proportion of ADA positive subjects remained similar throughout the study period ranging 
from 5.9% to 9.7% in the MYL-1701P arm at post-baseline visits compared to 8.7% to 10.6% in the 
Eylea arm. Some of these subjects had transient ADA positivity only in some visits with low titers. 
Overall, 2.8% subjects in MYL-1701P arm and 5.7% subjects in Eylea arm reported either treatment 
induced (developed any time after the initiation of drug administration in a subject without pre-existing 
ADA), or treatment boosted ADA (titer was at least 4 times the baseline titer in a subject who had a 
pre-existing ADA). Some of these subjects had positive ADA transiently at specific visits. 
NAb positivity was mostly transient and present in specific visits in most cases. Overall, 2 subjects in 
MYL-1701P and 5 subjects in Eylea arm tested positive for NAb at least in one of the post-baseline 
visits. There were no subjects in MYL-1701P arm and 1 subject (0.6%) in Eylea arm among subjects 
having treatment boosted ADA that tested positive for NAb. 
Mean titers were lower in the MYL-1701P treatment arm compared to Eylea at most time points, 
except at Week 1, when they were similar (17.902 [MYL-1701P] vs 15.745 [Eylea]). From Week 40, 
mean titers were more than 5-fold lower in the MYL-1701P group compared to Eylea, but SD was high 
in the Eylea group (e.g. at Week 52: Mean (SD) 18.324 (19.4393) [MYL-1701P] vs 135.906 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023

(342.3518) [Eylea]). Upon request, it was confirmed by the Applicant that this result was driven by 
three subjects with exceptionally high ADA titers (>1:200) in the Eylea group. Reduced efficacy, as 
assessed by BCVA and CRT, was only observed in one subject particularly standing out (ADA titer 
>1:1000). Moreover, no correlation with the occurrence of NAb or TEAEs was observed. 
Overall, immunogenicity appears lower in patients with MYL-1701P treatment compared to Eylea. 
Table 38: Summary of ADA and Nab* Results by Visit and Treatment 
 – Safety Set 
Table 39: Incidence of Treatment Induced and Boosted ADA and Nab  
– Safety Set 
The mean change (SD) in BCVA from baseline up to Week 52 in ADA positive subjects was 11.25 
(8.175) letters in MYL-1701P arm and 10.85 (5.998) letters in Eylea arm. Neither the BCVA change 
from baseline nor equivalence was compromised by the occurrence of ADA. In fact, at Week 8 the 
mean change from baseline in BCVA was even higher and very similar in both treatment arms in the 
ADA positive subgroup (Table in Section Ancillary analyses). No clinically relevant trends were 
observed in specific NAb positive subjects with respect to BCVA gain or CRT reduction over time during 
the study.  
The incidences of overall TEAEs at Week 52 by ADA status in safety analysis set is provided in Table 
40. Overall, no clinically relevant difference in the incidence of TEAEs observed between the study 
arms. Among the three subjects with a positive NAb result at some visit during the study in MYL-1701P 
arm, one subject reported an ocular TEAE (one subject; visual impairment). Among the 5 subjects with 
a positive NAb result in Eylea arm, two subjects had reported ocular TEAEs (one subject; diabetic 
retinal oedema [worsening] and one subject; retinal exudates).

A secondary objective of study MYL-1701P-3001 was to compare the impact of immunogenicity on 
safety. Upon request, the Applicant provided the safety analysis comparing treatment-induced and

2.4.7.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Reasons for discontinuation are also described in Section Results – Participant flow (Table 3). 
Overall, 36 (10.1%) subjects discontinued from the study prematurely, 18 subjects each from MYL-
1701P and Eylea arms. The reasons for early discontinuation of subjects from the study were also 
comparable between the arms, withdrawal of consent (8 [4.5%] in MYL-1701P arm vs 9 [5.1%] in 
Eylea arm) being the most common reason followed by withdrawal due to AEs (5 [2.8%] in MYL-1701P 
arm vs 4 [2.3%] in Eylea arm). Two subjects died in the MYL-1701P arm and three subjects in the 
Eylea arm. Brief narratives of all deaths and subjects who were discontinued from the study because of 
AEs up to Week 52 were provided. 
There were 4 subjects in the Eylea arm, (3 subjects due to Death, and one subject Withdrew consent), 
who completed the study treatment, but discontinued the study prior to completing Week 52/EOS visit. 
Incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported in the safety population are 
summarized in Table 42.  
With respect to ocular TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, only one such event occurred in the 
Eylea arm. No such event was identified in the MYL-1701P arm. 
IP discontinuation due to a TEAE was reported in both treatment arms in each 3 subjects, i.e. in total 
in 6/354 (1.7%) subjects. Upon request, the Applicant clarified that only 5 of those subjects were also 
discontinued from the study. A further 4 subjects were withdrawn from study due to an AE, leading to 
a total of 9 subjects discontinued study due to a TEAE, as indicated in Table 3 (Section Results – 
Participant flow).

2.4.7.8.  Post marketing experience 
This section is not applicable as MYL-1701P has not been approved or marketed yet in any country 
worldwide. 
As a Yesafili biosimilar to Eylea, MYL-1701P has been developed for use in the same adults indications 
approved for Eylea in the EU. It is a regulatory requirement of biotechnology-derived products to 
undertake post-marketing activities, including routine pharmacovigilance activities, such as periodic 
safety update reporting. Any additional risk minimization activities that may be required will be 
described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EMA guidelines 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1]. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In pivotal Phase 3 study MYL-1701P-3001 the safety analysis set consisted of all subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug. Of 355 randomized subjects, one subject randomized to the MYL-
1701P arm withdrew consent to participate before receiving a dose of the study drug, and was 
therefore not included in the safety analysis set. Treatment duration, extent of exposure, patient 
disposition and baseline characteristics were overall comparable between treatment arms. The majority 
of patients completed week 52 in both study arms. The provided safety database is therefore 
considered sufficient to assess the comparability regarding common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and very 
common (≥1/10) adverse events during biosimilar development. 
The overall incidence of TEAE was comparable between the study arms and the majority of TEAE was 
mild to moderate in severity. IP discontinuation due to a TEAE was reported in both treatment arms in 
each 3 subjects, i.e. in total in 6 subjects. Only 5 of those subjects were also discontinued from the 
study. A further 4 subjects were withdrawn from study due to an AE, leading to a total of 9 subjects 
discontinued study due to a TEAE.  
Non-ocular TEAEs were overall comparable between the treatment groups. However, more subjects 
treated with MYL-1701P reported SOC infections and infestations [55/178 (30.9%)] compared to 
subjects in the Eylea group [41/176 (23.3%)], along with corresponding PT nasopharyngitis (7.9% vs 
5.7%), sinusitis (2.2% vs 1.1%), bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia (in each 2.2% vs 0.6%) and 
respiratory tract infection (1.1% vs 0%). Further, the more frequently occurring PT pyrexia (3.9% vs 
1.7%) and cough (3.4% vs 0.6%) may indicate a higher incidence in the risk of (especially respiratory 
tract) infections. No ADRs related to the respiratory system are currently stated in section 4.8 of 
provided SmPC or in SmPC of Eylea. The observed higher incidence of reported infections as well as 
higher incidence of reported peripheral swelling (2.8% vs 0%) and fall (3.9% vs 0.6%) in the MYL-
1701P arm was not considered to impact the conclusion on similar safety, as those events were mostly 
mild to moderate in severity, not related to study drug and concerned few patients.  
Apart from those, other non-ocular TEAEs were reported in both groups at similar frequencies and no 
further concerns arise from these findings.  
The overall incidences of ocular TEAE in the study eye were highly similar between treatment arms 
[55/178 (30.9%) and 52/176 (29.5%) of subjects in the MYL-1701P and Eylea group, respectively]. Of 
those, cataract was reported more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm, while others were more 
frequently observed in the Eylea arm. In the study eye, severe ocular TEAEs were reported in one 
(0.6%) subject (PT: posterior capsule opacification) in the MYL-1701P arm and 3 (1.7%) subjects 
(PTs: macular hole, and vitreous detachment, vitreous detachment, cataract) in the Eylea arm. No 
ocular life-threatening ocular TEAEs were reported. The observed ocular TEAEs are listed ADR in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 91/104 
 
 
 
Eylea SmPC and therefore within the expected safety profile of Eylea and overall comparable between 
treatment arms.  
All the definitely related TEAEs were ocular TEAEs in study eye. Most of those are known undesirable 
effects of Eylea (SmPC), except papilledema, which occurred in the MYL-1701P treatment arm as a 
single AE of moderate severity, which occurred eight days after the first dose of MYL-1701P and 
resolved following treatment with cetirizine, topical dexamethasone and topical nepafenac. In general, 
reported drug related TEAEs (≥ 2 subjects by PT) are known undesirable effects of Eylea (SmPC), and 
appear to be less common in the MYL-1701P arm.  
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) have been reported as adverse events of interest, since 
there is a theoretical risk of cardiovascular effects upon systemic anti-VEGF treatment. In total, nine 
events were classified as MACE and numerically more MACE occurred in the Eylea arm. Of those, one 
event each of cardiac arrest, embolic stroke and brain stem infarction in the Eylea arm were classified 
possibly related to the study drug. Although cardiac arrest and embolic stroke were considered non-
fatal, the subject (Eylea arm) died after withdrawal from study. No concerns regarding the assessment 
of biosimilarity arises from those events, since overall mean concentrations of systemic aflibercept at 
expected Cmax were comparable in the PK subset of patients, and no association of high systemic 
aflibercept and the occurrence of MACE was observed. 
The occurrence of other AE of special interest, ocular injection procedure related TEAEs, was in 
line with known undesirable effects of Eylea (SmPC) and comparable between treatment arms. 
Overall, there were more subjects with serious TEAEs for MYL-1701P [31/178 (17.4%)] compared to 
Eylea [23/176 (13.1%)]. Numerically the highest difference was reported for PT infections and 
infestations. Similar to overall non-ocular TEAEs and as discussed above, as these events had different 
origins, no single type of infection could be identified. Hence, the overall higher incidence in the MYL-
1701P group may be a chance finding. Similarly, most serious TEAE were reported in both groups and 
at low numbers per PT. Three serious ocular TEAEs were reported, 1 in the MYL-1701P arm and 2 in 
the Eylea arm. The overall safety profile of serious TEAEs seems thus acceptable and comparable in 
both treatment arms. 
In total, 6 patients died during or after the study, 2 in the MYL-1701P arm and 4 in the Eylea arm. 
Narratives for all patients have been provided by the Applicant. All the events leading to death were 
considered not related to the study drug by the Investigator, which can be followed. All patients had 
prior/concomitant co-morbidities and two subjects died from COVID19 infections. One subject (Eylea 
arm) had Grade 4 SAE cardiac arrest and embolic stroke, which were considered possibly related to the 
study drug, and led to discontinuation from study after they had been resolved. Death occurred after 
the subject was withdrawn from the study. No concerns regarding aflibercept treatment arise from 
these fatal events. 
Taken together, the safety profile of MYL-1701P and Eylea is acceptable, in line with known undesirable 
effects of Eylea, and comparable between study arms. While numerically some TEAEs are reported 
more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm, most relevant (ocular, related, severe) TEAEs are reported 
more frequently in the Eylea arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology and serum chemistry mean laboratory parameters were comparable between treatment 
arms and no trends or notable shifts from normal were observed. By Week 52, HbA1c had shifted from 
normal to high more frequently in the Eylea arm. Urinalysis data and vital signs were comparable 
between treatment arms. No clinically meaningful trends were noted for ECG parameters between the 
study arms. Clinically significant abnormal ECG was observed in similar proportions of subjects 
between the study arms throughout the study duration.

As expected, mean IOP increased after intravitreal injection, and returned to baseline until the 
subsequent pre-dose measurement. Pre- and post-dose mean values as well as mean differences pre- 
and post-dose were similar between study arms. Increased IOP was experienced by 4 (2.2%) subjects 
treated with MYL-1701P vs 3 (1.7%) subjects treated with Eylea. IOP is a known common (≥1/100 to 
<1/10) undesirable effect of Eylea, and hence the incidence in both study arms was in line with the 
expected safety profile. Clinically significant abnormal findings from indirect ophthalmoscopy and slit-
lamp biomicroscopy are reported as AEs, which is considered appropriate. 
In conclusion, no safety concerns arise from laboratory findings, which were similar between study 
arms. 
Immunogenicity 
At baseline, similar proportions of patients were positive for ADA: 17/178 (9.6%) of subjects in the 
MYL-1701P group compared to 18/176 (10.2%) in the Eylea group. One subject was positive for NAb 
(MYL-1701P group). The overall incidence of ADA positive subjects at baseline was higher compared to 
what was observed in registrational Eylea studies (VIVID/VISTA), which may be explained by different 
sensitivity and specificity of the assays used. 
Throughout the study duration the proportion of ADA positive subjects remained similar in both 
treatment groups. Treatment induced or treatment boosted ADA were overall rare and only transiently 
observed in some patients. Likewise, the overall rare occurrence of NAbs was transient in most cases, 
and not observed in treatment induced or boosted ADA positive subjects, except 1 subject in the Eylea 
arm having treatment boosted ADA. Mean ADA titers were generally lower in the MYL-1701P treatment 
arm compared to Eylea. From Week 40, mean titers were more than 5-fold lower in the MYL-1701P 
group. This difference along with the observed high SD in the Eylea group can be explained by 
exceptionally high titers in few subjects. Reduced efficacy, as assessed by BCVA and CRT, was only 
observed in one subject with the highest ADA titer (>1:1000).  
Neither the change in BCVA from baseline nor equivalence was compromised by the occurrence of 
ADA. In fact, at Week 8 the mean change from baseline in BCVA was even higher and very similar in 
both treatment arms in the ADA positive subgroup in a descriptive analysis. No clinically relevant 
trends were observed in specific NAb positive subjects with respect to BCVA gain or CRT reduction over 
time during the study. Overall, no clinically relevant differences in the overall incidence of TEAEs was 
observed between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects or between study arms. In addition, the 
comparison of TEAE profiles of treatment-induced and treatment-boosted ADA/NAb positive subjects to 
those of ADA/NAb-negative subjects did not reveal any comprehensive findings.   
Taken together, overall immunogenicity appears lower in patients with MYL-1701P treatment compared 
to Eylea and no impact on efficacy or safety was observed upon occurrence of ADA. 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of Yesafili (MYL-1701P) is in line with known adverse events of Eylea (SmPC). 
Some events were reported more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm, while others were more frequent 
in the Eylea arm, but no significant differences were observed. Therefore, biosimilarity is supported 
from a safety perspective. The overall immunogenicity profile appears to be lower for MYL-1701P 
compared to Eylea.

2.7.2. Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Yesafili (aflibercept) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Yesafili (MYL-1701P; M710) is developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Eylea. The intravitreal 
route of administration, posology, and adult indications are identical to the reference product as 
described in the Eylea SmPC. Yesafili will be available in vials only, whereas Eylea is available in vials 
and pre-filled syringes (PFS). 
The marketing authorization is claimed for treatment of adults with  
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
•  macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (see section 5.1), 
• 
• 
diabetic macular edema (DME) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) (see section 5.1). 
Quality 
The Applicant performed a comprehensive analytical biosimilarity exercise comparing Yesafili (MYL-
1701P), the reference medicinal product EU-Eylea, and US-Eylea that was used in the pivotal clinical 
study MYL-1701P-3001. A sufficient number of MYL-1701P and Eylea lots, which can be expected to 
sufficiently reflect product variability of both the proposed biosimilar and the reference product, was 
included.  
The relevant quality attributes of the aflibercept molecule were assessed using a broad panel of 
orthogonal standard and state-of-the art techniques. Analyses covered primary sequence and higher 
order structure, size and charge variants, glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, as 
well as protein concentration. Functional activity was compared by a large panel of binding assays and 
cell-based biological assays covering the mode of action for the targeted indications and Fc-related 
functions. Based on the provided information, it is concluded that the analytical methods are suitable 
and sensitive to detect minor differences.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 97/104 
 
 
 
The quality attributes were either evaluated against a quality range or assessed qualitatively. 
Generally, the applied similarity criteria were insufficiently justified for several quality attributes. 
However, analytical results including chromatograms, spectra, response curves etc. for the individual 
lots have been provided, which enabled an independent assessment of the available data. 
Summary of clinical data 
Study MYL-1701P-3001 evaluated the clinical similarity of Yesafili (MYL-1701P; M710) and Eylea with 
regards to efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of subjects with 
DME. The study was a multi-center, (1:1) randomized, double masked, active controlled, comparative 
clinical trial to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful differences exist between Yesafili and US-
licensed Eylea in 355 subjects with DME treated up to 52 weeks. In total, application of 9 doses was 
scheduled (5 doses monthly, followed by 4 doses bi-monthly) to be administered via intravitreal 
injections of either 2 mg Yesafili or 2 mg US-Eylea. Additional doses were permitted upon worsening of 
the condition. 
Pharmacokinetics (free aflibercept concentrations) was evaluated for 89 patients participating in a PK 
subset of this study.  
The design of the clinical study has been discussed in Scientific Advices, which were largely adhered to 
by the Applicant. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
For most quality attributes including multiple attributes covering the mechanism of action, high 
analytical similarity of Yesafili (MYL-1701P) to the reference product EU-Eylea has been demonstrated. 
The observed analytical differences have been adequately justified and they are not expected to have a 
relevant impact on clinical performance of the product. 
Analytical comparability of EU-Eylea and US-Eylea has been satisfactorily demonstrated. 
Clinical 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint: In the ITT analysis set, the adjusted mean difference for the mean change in BCVA 
from baseline to Week 8 was 0.04 letters and the corresponding 95% CI was [-1.40, 1.47] which was 
well within the pre-defined and accepted equivalence range of [-3, +3] letters. In the PP analysis set, 
which is also considered primary by the Rapporteur, the adjusted mean difference for the mean change 
in BCVA from baseline to Week 8 was -0.19 letters and the corresponding 95% CI was [-1.66, 1.27] 
which was also fully contained within the pre-defined and accepted equivalence range. 
Key secondary endpoint: In the ITT analysis set, the mean treatment difference for the mean change 
in CRT from baseline up to Week 8, was 11.46 μm and the 95% CI was [-6.22 μm, 29.14 μm]. While 
an equivalence range was not defined for CRT, the 95% CI indicated no clinically relevant difference 
between the treatment groups. The mean change in CRT throughout the entire study duration 
indicated an increase of improvement (change from baseline) in both study arms over time. 
Other secondary endpoints: The mean change in BCVA over time up to Week 52 (ITT set) shows 
similar responses between the two treatment arms across visits. The proportion of subjects who gained 
≥15 letters at Week 52 were similar between the two treatment arms [33.0% (MYL-1701P) vs. 29.1% 
(Eylea); The adjusted mean change from baseline of 10.76 letters in the MYL-1701P arm and 10.52 
letters in the Eylea arm was however almost the same, such that the dichotomization led to some

difference]. The mean number of doses received during the 52 weeks of study were similar in both 
treatment arms (8.4 doses in the MYL-1701P arm and 8.7 doses in the Eylea arm). 
Ancillary analyses: Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint and results of each 
of these sensitivity analyses supported equivalence between the treatment arms based on that the 
95% confidence intervals of the treatment differences being within the pre-specified equivalence 
range, thus confirming the robustness of the primary analyses. These included, but were not limited 
to: 
•  Analysis of the primary endpoint in which BCVA values after discontinuing study medication 
(i.e., values with an assessment date after the last study medication date) were excluded. 
• 
Tipping point analysis for delta method using multiple imputation. 
In addition, several sensitivity and supplementary analyses were conducted to assess the impact due 
to COVID-19-related disruptions (e.g. missed/delayed visits), most of which showed equivalence 
between the treatment arms based on the 95% confidence intervals entirely lying within the pre-
specified equivalence range. 
In the most sensitive subgroup of subjects with baseline BCVA 50-69, the treatment effect was similar 
to the primary analysis of the overall study population. The mean treatment difference was -0.01 and 
the 95% CI was [-1.89, 1.86] and therefore within the pre-defined equivalence range of [-3, +3] 
letters. This subgroup was also the largest (114 subjects in MYL-1701P and 106 subjects in Eylea) and 
is therefore considered the most relevant in this biosimilar exercise. 
Further subgroup analyses (by baseline BCVA, age, gender, race, ethnicity, geographic region, baseline 
HbA1c, anti-VEGF therapy in fellow eye, ADA) showed that mean change in BCVA from baseline to 
Week 8 also consistently support equivalence between the treatment arms in subgroups. Similar was 
seen for subgroup analyses of the key secondary endpoint (mean change in CRT from baseline up to 
Week 8). 
PK 
Supportive PK analyses were conducted in a subset of patients enrolled in the pivotal clinical study 
MYL-1701P-3001. As systemic exposure is expected to be low, no formal hypothesis testing was 
planned. Mean values for plasma concentrations at anticipated maximum systemic exposure were 
similar in both treatment arms, supporting biosimilarity. 
Safety 
Overall, 354 subjects (178 in the MYL-1701P arm and 176 in the Eylea arm), received study treatment. 
The median treatment duration was 364 days in both study arms. 161/179 (89.9%) subjects in the 
MYL-1701P arm and 158/176 (89.8%) in the Eylea arm completed week 52. The safety database is 
considered appropriate to assess the comparability of common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and very common 
(≥1/10) adverse events for a biosimilar development. 
The overall incidence of TEAE was comparable between the study arms and the majority of all TEAE 
was mild to moderate in severity. 
Most non-ocular TEAE were reported in both groups and in total in a low number of patients. The 
overall safety profile seems therefore acceptable and comparable in both treatment arms. 
The overall incidences of ocular TEAEs in the study eye were highly similar between treatment arms: 
55/178 (30.9%) and 52/176 (29.5%) of subjects in the MYL-1701P and Eylea group, respectively. 
The majority of TEAEs were considered not related [in 231/354 (65.3%) of subjects] or unlikely 
[28/354 (7.9%) of subjects] related to study drug and there were no notable differences in frequencies

between the treatment arms. All of the definitely related TEAEs were ocular TEAEs in study eye. Most 
of those are known undesirable effects of Eylea (SmPC). 
The occurrence of ocular injection procedure related TEAEs was in line with known undesirable effects 
of Eylea (SmPC) and highly comparable between treatment arms. 
Hematology and serum chemistry mean laboratory parameters were comparable between treatment 
arms and no trends or notable shifts from normal were observed. Likewise, urinalysis data and vital 
signs were comparable between treatment arms. Increased IOP was experienced by 4 (2.2%) subjects 
treated with MYL-1701P vs 3 (1.7%) subjects treated with Eylea. 
The safety profile in both study arms was largely in line with the known safety profile of Eylea (SmPC). 
Immunogenicity 
At baseline, similar proportions of patients were positive for ADA: 17/178 (9.6%) of subjects in the 
MYL-1701P group compared to 18/176 (10.2%) in the Eylea group. Throughout the study duration the 
proportion of ADA positive subjects remained similar in both treatment groups. 
Neither the change from baseline nor equivalence was compromised by the occurrence of ADA. In fact, 
at Week 8 the mean change from baseline in BCVA was even higher and very similar in both treatment 
arms in the ADA positive subgroup. No clinically relevant trends were observed in specific NAb positive 
subjects with respect to BCVA gain or CRT reduction over time during the study.  
Overall, no clinically relevant differences in the incidence of TEAEs was observed between ADA positive 
and ADA negative subjects or between study arms. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The differences observed in biological activity and for the HMW variants have been sufficiently justified. 
An impact on clinical performance is not expected.  
Clinical 
Efficacy 
Other secondary endpoints: Although the median number of doses received during the 52 weeks of 
study was nine in both treatment arms, the median of discrete numbers is an insensitive metric, and 
indeed only 56.3% of all patients received nine doses, as planned per study protocol. Reassuringly, 
only few of those patients received additional doses due to worsening of their condition, since the 
majority of patients who received 9 doses have not received any additional dose (95%). More patients 
in the MYL-1701P arm received additional doses of aflibercept (30.3%) compared to subjects receiving 
Eylea (23.9%), which is partially attributed to more optional doses received after a missed planned 
dose in patients in the MYL-1701P arm, rather than worsening of their condition. A slightly higher 
proportion of subjects in the Eylea arm received less than 9 planned doses. 
Ancillary analyses:  
In some subgroup analyses the sample size was too low to for a meaningful interpretation of analysis 
results as these led to wide 95% CIs and thereby extending across the equivalence range.  
Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 100/104 
 
 
 
The safety database is considered sufficient to assess the comparability regarding common (≥1/100 to 
<1/10) and very common (≥1/10) adverse events. However, it is too small to inform on less 
frequently occurring adverse events.  
More subjects experienced at least one related TEAE in the Eylea arm [12/176 (6.8%)] compared to 
MYL-1701P [5/178 (2.8%)]. Similarly, 3/176 (1.7%) experienced a related serious TEAE in the Eylea 
arm compared to zero in the MYL-1701P group. 
More subjects treated with MYL-1701P reported non-ocular TEAEs for SOC infections and infestations 
[55/178 (30.9%)] compared to subjects in the Eylea group [41/176 (23.3%)], along with 
corresponding PT nasopharyngitis (7.9% vs 5.7%), sinusitis (2.2% vs 1.1%), bronchitis, influenza and 
pneumonia (in each 2.2% vs 0.6%), respiratory tract infection (1.1% vs 0%), pyrexia (3.9% vs 1.7%) 
and cough (3.4% vs 0.6%). 
Numerically higher incidences of non-ocular TEAE in the MYL-1701P arm were also observed for SOC 
investigations, metabolism and nutrition disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, renal and urinary 
disorders, general disorders & administration site conditions, injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. On the other hand, Eylea treated 
subjects more frequently reported SOC vascular disorders, nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal & 
connective tissue disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders. However, most of these TEAEs 
per PT occurred in only few patients and at comparable frequencies between treatment arms per PT.  
The ocular TEAE cataract was reported more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm [11/178 (6.2%) 
subjects] compared to the Eylea group [6/176 (3.4%) subjects]. 
Most of definitely related ocular TEAEs are known undesirable effects of Eylea (SmPC), except 
papilledema, which occurred at a single occasion in the MYL-1701P treatment arm.  
The frequency of drug related TEAEs (≥ 2 subjects by PT) was higher in Eylea treated subjects [12/176 
(6.8%)] compared to the MYL-1701P arm [5/178 (2.8%)]. 
Nine events were classified as MACE and occurred in seven subjects, more frequently in the Eylea arm 
[5/176 (2.8%)] compared to the MYL-1701P arm [2/178 (1.1%) subjects].  
Overall, there were more subjects with serious TEAE for MYL-1701P [31/178 (17.4%)] compared to 
Eylea [23/176 (13.1%)]. 
By Week 52, HbA1c had shifted from normal to high more frequently in the Eylea arm. Abnormal ECG 
interpretation was observed more frequently in the MYL-1701P arm throughout the study duration, but 
was considered not clinically significant in the majority of subjects. 
Immunogenicity 
2.8% subjects in MYL-1701P arm and 5.7% subjects in Eylea arm reported either treatment induced 
(developed any time after the initiation of drug administration in a subject without pre-existing ADA) or 
treatment boosted ADA (titer was at least 4 times the baseline titer in a subject who had a pre-existing 
ADA). Some of these subjects had positive ADA only transiently at specific visits. Overall, 2 subjects in 
MYL-1701P and 5 subjects in Eylea arm tested positive for NAb at least in one of the post-baseline 
visits, but the occurrence of NAb was transient in most cases, and not observed in treatment induced 
or boosted ADA positive subjects, except 1 subject in the Eylea arm having treatment boosted ADA. 
Mean ADA titers were generally lower in the MYL-1701P treatment arm compared to Eylea.  
Overall, immunogenicity appears to be lower in patients with MYL-1701P treatment compared to Eylea.

3.4.  Discussion on biosimilarity 
Overall, at the quality level similarity between MYL-1701P (M710) and EU-sourced Eylea could be 
demonstrated for most quality attributes in a comprehensive analytical similarity exercise. 
Comparability between EU- and US-sourced Eylea, which was used as comparator in the pivotal clinical 
trial, could be demonstrated in the analytical similarity exercise. The observed differences have been 
adequately justified and are not expected to impact clinical performance of the product. 
The pivotal clinical study MYL-1701P-3001 was adequately designed to demonstrate equivalence 
between Yesafili (MYL-1701P) and US-Eylea on an efficacy level, as well as safety. The selected study 
population of patients with DME, as well as primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are deemed 
appropriate for this biosimilarity exercise. The primary efficacy endpoint, change in BCVA from baseline 
to Week 8, was well within the pre-defined equivalence range of +/- 3 letters and demonstrated 
equivalent efficacy in the primary endpoint. Biosimilarity was further confirmed by secondary 
endpoints, which included change in CRT and BCVA over time.  
The overall safety profile appears comparable between Yesafili and Eylea and was largely in line with 
the known safety profile of Eylea (SmPC) in both study arms. Adverse events were equally reported 
more frequently in the Yesafili arm or in the Eylea arm, with no observable pattern favouring either of 
the two. Most observed imbalances between the treatment groups concern only few patients and 
events and should therefore be interpreted with caution and not be overinterpreted. Immunogenicity is 
overall observed to be somewhat lower after MYL-1701P treatment, but this is likely a chance finding 
due to overall very low and transient occurrence of treatment induced or treatment boosted ADA, or 
NAb. The occurrence of ADA did not compromise the change in BCVA from baseline in either treatment 
arm or equivalence. PK analyses conducted in a subset of patients within the pivotal study are 
appropriate and the comparable PK results with little systemic availability do support biosimilarity. 
Overall, the clinical data suggest biosimilarity between Yesafili (MYL-1701P) and US-Eylea regarding 
efficacy and safety, as well as PK. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The Applicant is seeking approval of Yesafili (MYL-1701P) in all adults indications, for which Eylea is 
approved. The Yesafili (MYL-1701P) program provides clinical data from a pivotal study in patients with 
DME. The mechanism of action of Eylea in DME is representative of the mechanism of action of Eylea in 
all other adults indications for which Eylea is approved. VEGF plays a central role in the pathogenesis 
of DME, wAMD, RVO, and myopic CNV. In each of these patient populations, aflibercept is understood 
to act as a soluble decoy receptor that inhibits the receptor binding of VEGF-A and PlGF and 
subsequently the angiogenic downstream signal cascade and functional activities. 
Highly sensitive in vitro assays were used to measure biological activities known to be critical to the 
mechanism of action of aflibercept with multiple batches of MYL-1701P and Eylea. 
The justification presented by the Applicant to allow extrapolation from DME to all approved adults 
indications of Eylea is considered adequate. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Establishment of the aflibercept (MYL-1701P) drug substance process control strategy followed an 
enhanced development approach and heavily depends on qualification of the used small-scale models 
(SSM) and the outcome of the process characterisation studies. In addition, adequate qualification of 
the SSM is also essential for validity of the virus clearance studies. At D120 a Major Objection was 
Assessment report  
EMA/359132/2023  
Page 102/104 
 
 
 
raised in relation to the SSMs and process characterisation. The issues raised in the Major Objection 
have been satisfactorily addressed during the procedure.  
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Yesafili is considered biosimilar to Eylea. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, symptomatic, inflammatory skin disease 
characterised by itch, dry skin, and eczematous lesions affecting children, adolescents and adults.  
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 8/110 
 
 
 
 
The clinical manifestations of AD are overall similar in adults and paediatric patients, although the 
location and type of skin lesions may differ 1, 2, 3:  
• 
eczematous, papulo-vesicular, and patchy lesions localised to the cheeks are common in 
infants, 
• 
• 
eczematous lesions typically involving flexural areas, nape of the neck, dorsum of the feet, and 
hands are common in children, and  
mostly lichenified plaques involving flexural areas as well as head and neck are common in 
adolescents and adults. 
The claimed therapeutic indication 
The  proposed  indication  is:  Baricitinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  atopic 
dermatitis  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  2  years of  age  and  older  who  are  candidates  for systemic 
therapy.  
Epidemiology 
AD is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. The prevalence of AD is higher in 
children than in adults.  The prevalence of AD ranges from approximately 9% in teenagers to 14% in 
children 0 to 4 years of age 4. In addition, the distribution of severity tends to shift to higher severities 
at older ages, with older children being more likely to have moderate-to-severe disease 5. 
Clinical presentation 
Itch is the key symptom of AD and is one of the most bothersome symptoms of AD. The itch-scratch 
cycle can lead to the worsening of AD by increasing inflammation and the potential for infection 6. 
Furthermore, severe itch is associated with decreased Quality of Life (QoL) affecting emotional 
wellbeing and leading to sleep problems 7, 8. Family life can also be severely impaired because of sleep 
deprivation by the affected child as well as by disruption of school and social interactions, including 
interaction with  peers and family members  9, 10, 11, 12.

Management 
AD is standardly treated with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCS) to address barrier 
dysfunction and immune abnormalities: low-potency TCS for mild AD and medium and high-potency 
TCS for moderate-to-severe AD. However, the continuous long-term use of TCS is not recommended 
because of the risk of local side effects like skin atrophy, dyspigmentation and systemic exposure, 
especially in children with a proportionately greater body surface area to weight ratio 13. Topical 
calcineurin inhibitors (TCNI) are approved for the treatment of AD in paediatric patients from the age 
of 2 years with inadequate response or intolerance to TCS or where treatment with TCS is either 
inadvisable or not possible. In addition, the use of TCNI’s is commonly restricted to sensitive areas of 
skin, such as eyelids. 
Ciclosporin is approved only in some countries for paediatric patients with AD, restricted to treating 
patients ≥16  years old with severe AD when systemic therapy is required. However, since 2020, 
several systemic treatments (dupilumab, upadacitinib, and tralokinumab) have been authorised in the 
EU: 
•  Dupilumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults and adolescents 
12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy and for severe AD in children aged 
6 to 11  years who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
•  Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults and adolescents 
12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.  
• 
Tralokinumab is indicated for the treatment of adolescent patients of 12 years and older who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Despite the  recent approval of newer systemic treatments, there remains an unmet medical need for 
AD paediatric patients who do not respond to currently approved systemic therapies. Further, oral JAK 
inhibitors (abrocitinib  and upadacitinib) have shown a relatively fast response in adults with AD 
compared to dupilumab  14, 15. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Baricitinib is an orally available, selective JAK inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2, 
and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 2  16. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, along with 
the STAT pathway, play an important role in signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor 
binding to  their receptors  17.  
The fundamental pathophysiology of AD, with excessive T cell activation, is similar among adults,

adolescents, and children 18, 19). The JAK-STAT pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD 
by upregulating epidermal chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and proangiogenic factors as well 
as by downregulating antimicrobial peptides and factors responsible for skin barrier function 20. The 
JAK-STAT signalling pathway is functional from infancy, and aberrations in JAK-STAT signalling are 
implicated in other rare autoinflammatory diseases with onset within the first year of life 21, 22.  
Baricitinib has been shown to improve AD disease severity in adults  23, 24 and has received regulatory 
authorisation in the  EU (Olumiant SmPC), for the treatment of adult patients with  moderate-to-severe 
AD who are candidates for systemic therapies. Baricitinib also is indicated for the treatment of 
moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded 
inadequately to or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, for the 
treatment of severe alopecia areata (AR) in adults and for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(JIA). Olumiant is available as 1, 2 and 4 mg film-coated immediate-release tablet either as 
monotherapy or in combination with non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. 
2.1.3.  The development programme 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for paediatric AD includes one global clinical study 
(I4V-MC-JAIP) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in paediatric 
patients with  moderate-to-severe AD. The design of the Phase 3 registration programme was agreed 
upon with  the PDCO as laid down in the PIP and its modification (EMEA-001220-PIP03-16-M01).   
Study JAIP included a 2 week, open-label PK lead-in in a small number of patients to confirm 
baricitinib exposure at the high dose that was planned to be used in the double-blind part of the study. 
Following  the results, the high dose used in the randomised, double-blind part of the study was 4 mg 
QD for older participants (10 to <18  years) and 2 mg QD for younger participants (2 to <10 years). 
Medium and low doses were consequently selected at 2 mg QD and 1 mg QD (10 to <18 years) and 1 
mg QD and 0.5  mg QD (2 to <10  years). Participants enrolled in the open-label PK lead-in part of the 
study (N  = 33) contributed to  safety analyses but not efficacy analyses. The primary objective of the 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-dose part of the study was to demonstrate the superiority of 
each dose of baricitinib (low, medium, high) versus placebo in the proportion of participants achieving 
IGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at week 16. Patients were allowed to use low or medium-
potency TCS, which could be tapered down when lesions disappeared. Patients who participated in the 
double-blind treatment period and completed through week 16 were eligible to continue in the long-
term treatment extension period for up to 4 additional years of treatment. 
The long-term extension phase is ongoing. At the time of the data cut-off of 20 June 2022, all 
participants had completed at least 24 weeks of treatment in study JAIP, results up to the 24-week

timepoint  for efficacy and up to 3 years for safety were submitted. 
The PDCO adopted an opinion on 11 November 2022, confirming the compliance of all studies in the 
agreed paediatric investigation plan as set out in the latest Agency’s Decision (P/0311/2021) of 11 
August 2021.  PIP compliance for study JAIP, denoted as study 4 in the PIP, was concluded in an earlier 
decision (EMEA-C3-001220-PIP03-16-M02).  The submitted  article 46 paediatric study I4V-MC-JAIP 
(EMEA/C/004085/46/014)  is combined with this extension application. The MAH did not ask for CHMP 
Scientific Advice. There is no EMA guidance for clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for 
the treatment of AD. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, all studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (ICH 
2016)  and applicable local laws and regulations. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated environmental risk assessment has been provided. Since the estimations of exposure to 
the environment in previous ERAs were age agnostic, those previous predicted environmental 
concentrations will not  change with the addition of paediatric AD patients. Therefore, the submitted 
ERA is based on the AA submission updated to reflect that all 3 indications RA, AD and AA are now 
registered but the conclusions have not changed. The environmental data previously submitted with 
the initial  dossier serves as the basis for the updated environmental risk assessment.  
Physical-chemical properties and fate characteristics indicate that baricitinib will not persist in the 
aqueous environmental compartment since it undergoes some removal by binding to sludge biosolids 
during sewage treatment and by partitioning to sediment once in the water column. The concentration 
of baricitinib in sediment are predicted to be very low. Baricitinib is subject to some removal from the 
sediment compartment through biodegradation and irreversible binding to sediment particles. The rate 
of removal is slow and there is some potential for persistence of low concentrations in aquatic 
sediment. Using assumptions of no metabolism, no removal during sewage treatment, and 1% of the 
European population taking the maximum dose for each indication, the maximum predicted 
environmental concentration of total baricitinib residue in surface water is 0.06 μg/L and in sediment is 
230 μg/kg (dry weight). 
Studies to evaluate both  acute and chronic effects on environmental species have been conducted with 
baricitinib. Fish  were the most sensitive species tested. The predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) 
of baricitinib for surface water, groundwater, and sewage microorganisms were 60, 210, and 100000 
μg/L,  respectively. The PNEC for sediment was 27150 μg/kg. The predicted environmental 
concentrations of total residues of baricitinib are significantly lower than the PNEC values. Therefore, 
excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected to result in a significant 
environmental risk. Additionally, baricitinib is not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms 
based on a log Kow less than 4.5. Therefore, baricitinib is not classified as a PBT or a vPvB molecule. 
The initial estimate of the PEC surface water is based on the maximum recommended daily dose of the 
active ingredient, a default market penetration of 1% of the total population, 200 L of wastewater 
discharge per capita, and an average dilution factor of 10 for discharge into surface water. For drug

substances used for multiple indications, the PECs for each indication are summed. PEC surface water 
calculated for each indication of baricitinib is 0.02 μg/L and the total PEC surface water is 0.06 μg/L. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies were submitted which  was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
The conclusion by the Applicant that excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not 
expected to result in a significant environmental risk is endorsed.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the current application, the Applicant is requesting an extension for the treatment of paediatric 
patients aged 2 to <18  years with atopic dermatitis with a dose of 2 mg once daily in patients with a 
body weight <30 kg and a dose of 4 mg once daily in patients with a body weight of ≥30 kg. Patients 
with  renal impairment or on OAT3 inhibitors  should reduce the recommended dose by half. One clinical 
studied was conducted to evaluate the PK and PD of baricitinib in paediatric patients with AD (study 
JAIP). Furthermore, PopPK and exposure-response analysis were performed to support the extension 
of indication. 
Analytical methods 
Plasma 
Baricitinib plasma samples obtained during the studies were analysed using a validated liquid-liquid 
extraction followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection method. 
Labcorp Bioanalytical Services LLC (previously called Covance Bioanalytical Services LLC) located in 
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, performed the bioanalytical methods. The lower limit of quantification was 
0.20  ng/mL, and the upper limit of quantification  was 200.00 ng/mL.  Samples above the limit of 
quantification  were diluted to yield results within the calibrated range. Validation results are shown in 
Table 1.

A total of 2063 samples were analysed within 595 days of collection. 27 samples (1.3% of the total 
number of samples) were reanalysed due to high internal standard response (n =21), above the limit 
of quantitation  (n=3),  insufficient sample (n=1), and poor chromatography (n=2). During the 
bioanalysis of study samples, inter-assay accuracy (%relative error) and inter-assay precision 
(%relative standard deviation) ranged from 97.7 to 103.2% and -2.3% to 3.2%, respectively. A total 
of 156 samples were reanalysed to assess incurred sample reproducibility. 99.4% of repeat and 
original results were within 20% of each other.

Population PK model 
The objective of the population pharmacokinetic analysis for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis patients 
aged 2 to <18 years is to support the posology. Specifically, the analyses aimed to: 
• 
• 
characterize the population PK of baricitinib and estimate the magnitude of interpatient variability 
in baricitinib exposure. 
confirm whether baricitinib exposure in paediatric patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg equivalent 
once daily doses is comparable to the exposure in adults receiving baricitinib 4 mg once daily 
during the PK lead-in period 
A total of 2257 baricitinib  concentrations from 392 patients were used to characterise the PK in 
paediatric patients  with  atopic dermatitis. The PK data were analysed using population  pharmacokinetic 
(PopPK) methodology with NONMEM  (Version 7.4.2) and Perl-Speaks NONMEM (Version 4.8.1). The 
model was validated using standard methods, including visual predictive checks and bootstrap 
analyses to verify that the model predictions matched the observed data. Whole blood samples were 
collected from all participants in the lead-in period. Plasma concordance samples with time-matched 
whole blood samples were collected from a subset of participants in the older age group. A total of 15 
plasma concordance samples were available from 15 participants. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 
determined as the slope of the regression line using time-matched blood and plasma samples. The 
slope (1.32) was used to convert the blood data to plasma equivalents. A total of 214 whole blood 
samples were collected from 33 participants enrolled in the lead-in period and converted to plasma 
equivalents. Samples below the quantitative limit (N=8)  and outliers (N=1)  were excluded. The plasma 
equivalents were used to perform the PK analyses for the open-label PK lead-in period. From the final 
2257  samples, samples below the quantitative limit (N=212), samples collected prior to the first dose 
or within  the lag time (N=9)  or outliers (N=1) were excluded from the analysis from 156 participants. 
The final PopPK model used the same model structure as the previously developed PK model in adult 
patients. It  was a 2-compartment model with zero-order absorption, including lag time and a semi-
mechanistic partitioning  of CL/F into an eGFR-dependent CLr/F and CLnr/F.  An allometric relationship 
was used for the effect of weight on clearance-related parameters (CL/F, CLr/F, and

intercompartmental clearance) with the allometric exponent fixed to 0.75, and for the effect of weight 
on central and peripheral volume of distribution with the exponent fixed to 1. The absorption duration 
(D1) parameter included a Box-Cox-transformed BSV. There is no clinically relevant effect of gender, 
race, or ethnicity on baricitinib PK. The data do not suggest the need for any dose adjustment in 
patients with  atopic dermatitis on the basis of these factors. Age was not retained as a covariate once 
body weight and renal function were added to the model. PK parameters from the final PK model are 
provided in Table 3. 
The prediction-corrected VPC plot for the 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg doses is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Prediction-corrected visual predictive check for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4mg doses for the final 
pharmacokinetic model in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis 
Patients were dosed by age group in study JAIP. Since weight is a more physiologically relevant patient 
factor, the effect of weight on the Cmax and AUC was further evaluated to identify an optimal weight 
cut-off value for dosing. 
Absorption 
After oral administration of baricitinib, Cmax levels are reached ~1h after dosing (0.5-3.0 h). The 
absolute oral bioavailability of baricitinib from the commercial tablet is ~79% in healthy volunteers. 
In healthy adult volunteers, the Cmax is 41.6 nM, and the AUC0-∞ is 275 nM × h at the clinical dose of 4 
mg. 
In adult subjects with  rheumatoid arthritis, the Cmax is 53.2 ng/mL, and AUCτ is 483 ng × h/mL, which 
are higher compared to healthy volunteers. In addition, CL/F is ~46% lower and t½ ~25% shorter in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients relative to that  in heathy subjects. 
In adult patients  with atopic dermatitis, the  Cmax and AUC at steady state are 45.9 ng/mL and 415 ng 
× h/mL,  respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. The exposure tends to be lower in 
patients with  atopic dermatitis compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (factor 0.86)  and higher 
compared to healthy volunteers at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. 
In adult patients  with alopecia areata, the Cmax and AUC at steady state are 47.5 ng/mL and 435 ng × 
h/mL, respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. The exposure tends to be lower in patients 
Assessment report

Page 17/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  alopecia areata compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (factor 0.89) and higher compared 
to healthy volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis. 
In healthy volunteers, the intra-individual variability in AUC and Cmax is low (<14%), and the inter-
individual variability is moderate (17-26%). The inter-individual variability in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients was 41%  for the AUC and 22% for the Cmax. The inter-individual variability was 50% for the 
AUC and 21% for the Cmax in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of baricitinib is ~50% and was independent of the concentration (including 
clinically relevant concentrations). The blood-to-plasma ratio is 1.14, indicating a weak/moderate 
association with the blood cell compartment. 
The volume of distribution is ~1.1 L/kg, indicating  that baricitinib  distributes from the plasma 
compartment into tissues. The Vd is 2.0 L/kg in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis and 2.3 L/kg in 
patients with  atopic dermatitis. 
Metabolism 
Only baricitinib was detected circulating in human plasma. Metabolites accounted for 4-7% of the dose 
in urine and ~1% in faeces. In addition, baricitinib is metabolised to a limited extent in vitro. Overall, 
these data indicate that metabolism does not significantly contribute to the  clearance of baricitinib. The 
enzymes involved in the limited metabolism of baricitinib were not identified, but this was also 
considered not warranted. 
Transporters 
In vitro  studies indicate that baricitinib  is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. 
Baricitinib is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1. The transporters 
P-glycoprotein, OAT3 and MATE2-K are most likely involved in the active excretion into urine. BCRP 
may be involved in the excretion via faeces. However, excretion via faeces is limited; therefore, the in 
vivo  contribution  of BCRP to the excretion of baricitinib is most likely limited. Genetic polymorphisms in 
P-glycoprotein will most likely not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of baricitinib. For MATE-
2K, a conclusion on whether SNPs in MATE-2K would lead to clinically significant changes in the PK of 
baricitinib cannot be drawn as current information is too limited. A higher clearance of baricitinib due 
to the rs12943590  variant in MATE-2K will  most likely not lead to a clinically relevant effect since a 
good response was observed in non-renal patients to a 2 mg dose. 
Excretion 
Baricitinib is mainly excreted via urine and predominately as the parent. Around 20% of the dose is 
excreted via faeces. This is most likely mainly unabsorbed baricitinib since the bioavailability is ~79%. 
The total clearance is ~17 L/h, and the renal clearance is ~13.4 L/h in healthy subjects. These results 
indicate that  baricitinib is actively excreted into the urine, which is confirmed by the transporter 
studies. The CL is 11.9 L/h  in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis and ~14.2  L/h in patients  with atopic 
dermatitis. The elimination half-life of baricitinib is ~10 h in  healthy volunteers and 12.5 h in patients 
with  rheumatoid arthritis, and 12.9 h in  patients with  atopic dermatitis. 
Assessment report

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The Cmax and AUC0-∞ increase dose-proportionally in healthy subjects over a single dose range of 1 to 
30 mg (slightly  more over the dose range 30 to 40 mg). 
After multiple once-daily dosing, a steady state was reached between the second and third dose. 
Accumulation after repeated dose administration of baricitinib is minimal; the accumulation ratio 
ranged from 0.89- to 1.25-fold and 1.02-  to 1.24-fold based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study JAIP is a Phase 3, multicentre randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
outpatient  study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in paediatric 
patients with  moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This study was conducted at 78 centres in 17 
countries and was conducted between May 2019 and April 2022. In the two-week open-label period in 
which the  PK was investigated, patients aged 2 to <10 years received a dose of 2 mg once daily as 
oral suspension and patients aged 10 to <18 years received a dose of 4 mg once daily as a tablet. 
During  the double-blind treatment period, patients received 0.5 mg (lowest dose for patients aged 2 to 
<10 years), 1 mg (lowest dose for patients aged ≥10 years), 2 mg (highest dose for patients aged 2 
to <10  years) or 4 mg (highest dose for patients aged ≥10 years). A total of 32 patients were 2 to <6 
years, 79 patients were 6 to <10 years and 281 patients were 10 to <18 years. The body weight 
ranged from 12 to 104 kg (mean was 46.6 kg). 
Whole blood samples were collected in the lead-in period to determine if paediatric exposure to 
baricitinib was consistent with  baricitinib exposure in adults at 4 mg once daily. Plasma samples were 
collected in the lead-in and double-blind treatment period from patients that received placebo and 
baricitinib for approximately 16 weeks from baseline. Samples were collected during the lead-in period 
pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4,  6 hours post-dose and during the double-blind treatment period 
pre-dose and at 0.25, 1, 2 to 4, 4 to  6 hours post-dose. 
The PK parameters are summarised in Table 4. Population PK analysis showed that CL/F and apparent 
volume of distribution decrease with decrease in body weight and age.

Special populations 
The effect on the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib on renal function, hepatic function, age, weight, race, 
gender, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were investigated. 
Moderate hepatic impairment, age (age range of 19 to 83 years) and ERS (measure of disease state in 
Rheumatoid Arthritis patients)  did not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure to baricitinib. 
No clinical studies with  baricitinib were performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients 
with  severe hepatic impairment often have serious co-morbidities, which calls for caution when 
considering pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the use of baricitinib in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is not recommended, which is acceptable. 
A reduction in baricitinib renal clearance and an increase in the AUC were observed with increased 
severity of renal impairment. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a less pronounced effect of renal 
function on the  exposure of baricitinib was observed. This is consistent with a reduced fraction of 
excretion out of the total elimination pathways of baricitinib in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis 
compared to healthy subjects. In addition, renal function had a significant effect on the AUCτ,ss, but not 
on Cmax,ss of baricitinib in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, similar to adult patients with

rheumatoid arthritis. The estimated mean ratios (lower renal function: normal renal function) for 
AUCτ,ss were 2.06 and 1.56 for moderate and mild renal impairment, respectively. 
In addition, Cmax decreased with increasing body weight. However, the effect of body weight on 
baricitinib PK is not considered clinically relevant in adults. Gender and race (American versus 
Japanese) were shown to have an effect on the PK of baricitinib, but this is most likely due to 
differences in body weight. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Baricitinib as victim 
In vitro  and in vivo  data indicate that >10%  of the baricitinib dose is metabolised. Baricitinib is actively 
excreted by the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. In clinical drug-drug 
interaction (DDI)  studies,  the potential of other drugs to affect the PK of baricitinib was investigated. A 
clinically significant interaction was observed when baricitinib was co-administered with probenecid (a 
strong OAT3 inhibitor). No  other clinical DDI studies have been conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with 
less inhibition potential.  Co-administration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibition), fluconazole 
(strong CYP2C19 inhibition  and moderate CYP2C9 and 3A inhibition), rifampicin (inducer via CAR/PXR 
of, among others CYP3A and P-glycoprotein) and cyclosporine (P-glycoprotein inhibition) with 
baricitinib did not  have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib. No in vivo 
studies were performed for the inhibition of BCRP and MATE2-K. Complete inhibition of BCRP may lead 
to a bioavailability of 100% which may result in an AUC increase of 1.25-fold. This increase is not 
considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the clinical significance of an interaction at MATE2-K would 
be minimal, given the multiple exit routes of baricitinib from the proximal tubule cell. Maximal 
inhibition  of MATE-2K will lead to a less than 2-fold increase in the AUC of baricitinib because other 
transporters can compensate for the lack of function. Therefore, inhibition of MATE-2K is likely not 
clinically relevant. An increase in gastric pH does not affect the overall exposure to baricitinib. 
Therefore, baricitinib may be co-administered with drugs that are gastric pH-modifying agents. 
Baricitinib as perpetrator 
Baricitinib is not an inhibitor  of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,  3A4, and 3A5 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. In addition, baricitinib is not  an inducer via AhR, PXR and CAR at clinically relevant 
maximal plasma concentrations, portal vein concentrations and maximal intestinal concentrations. 
Therefore, it is unlikely that baricitinib will lead to clinically relevant DDIs due to CYP inhibition or 
induction.  Furthermore, baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, MATE-1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Baricitinib may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. 
Concomitant administration of baricitinib  with drugs for which the rate-limiting  step is hepatic uptake 
by OCT1, may lead to an increase in Cmax. 
In clinical DDI  studies, the potential of baricitinib  to affect the PK of oral contraceptives (via CYP3A), 
simvastatin (via CYP3A and OATP1B1), and digoxin (via P-glycoprotein) was investigated. The clinical 
DDI  studies confirm the in vitro  data that baricitinib  is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and not an 
inhibitor  of P-glycoprotein. Concomitant administration with simvastatin led to a (not clinically 
significant) decrease in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin. The underlying mechanism of action is 
unknown. Furthermore, baricitinib does not have an effect on the PK of methotrexate, a commonly 
concomitant prescribed medicine in RA patients. 
In the clinical safety studies, an effect on the creatinine clearance was observed (decrease in creatinine 
clearance). Creatinine is cleared by the following transporters OCT2, OAT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023

Baricitinib was not an inhibitor of OCT2, OAT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant 
concentrations. The cause for this observed decreased creatinine clearance is unknown. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis weighing  <30 kg, the Cmax is 57.1 ng/mL, and the AUCτ is 
298 ng ×  h/mL. 
In paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis weighing  ≥30 kg, the Cmax is 50.3 ng/mL, and the AUCτ is 
383 ng ×  h/mL. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Baricitinib is an orally available, selective JAK inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2, 
and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 216. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, along with 
the STAT pathway, play an important role in signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor 
binding to  their receptors7. In the pathogenesis of AD, the JAK-STAT pathway plays a critical role by 
upregulating epidermal chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and proangiogenic factors as well as 
by downregulating antimicrobial peptides and factors responsible for skin barrier function20. The 
fundamental pathophysiology of AD, with excessive T cell activation, is similar among age groups 
(adults, adolescents, and children) 18,19. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is functional from infancy, 
and aberrations in JAK-STAT signalling are implicated in other rare autoinflammatory diseases with 
onset within  the first year of life21,22. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response relationship 
In the study JAIP patients were treated with placebo or 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg in the double-
blind treatment  period. Sparse blood samples were collected, and PopPK modelling was used to 
determine the PK of baricitinib for the different dosages. The Cavg,ss was used as a measure for 
exposure. 
Using the data of study JAIP, efficacy endpoints from 514 patients were used for exposure quartile 
analyses for the primary endpoint, IGA 0 or 1 at week 16, and for the secondary endpoint, EASI75 at 
week 16. For the secondary endpoint, Itch NRS at Week 16, data were collected from patients aged 10 
to <18  years; thus, 242 patients were included in that analysis. 
An exposure-response relationship was observed for the overall group of patients when dosed with 0.5 
mg (lowest dose for patients aged 2 to <10 years), 1 mg (lowest dose for patients aged ≥10 years), 2 
mg (highest dose for patients aged 2 to <10 years) or 4 mg (highest dose for patients aged ≥10 
years) on the primary and key secondary endpoints at week 16:IGA score of 0 or 1 (Figure 2); EASI75 
(Figure 3);  Itch NRS (Figure 4).  
The dose applied in the study JAIP was stratified by age; the high dose used in the randomised, 
double-blind part was 4 mg QD for older participants (10 to <18 years) and 2 mg QD for younger 
participants (2 to  <10 years). When the exposure-response analyses were stratified by weight class 
(<30  kg or ≥30 kg), results differed per outcome. For IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (primary outcome), the

exposure-response relationship for patients <30 kg and ≥30 kg were numerically similar to the overall 
results (as in Figure 2). For EASI75 at week 16 (secondary outcome), the exposure-response 
relationship for patients <30 kg and ≥30 kg was numerically dissimilar to the overall results. Notably, 
in the patients  weighing <30 kg, the response in Q4 was lower than the responses of placebo, Q2 and 
Q3 (Figure 3).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant is requesting an extension of indication for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 2 to 
<18 years with atopic dermatitis with  a dose of 2 mg once daily in patients with a body weight <30 kg 
and a dose of 4 mg once daily in patients with a body weight of ≥30 kg. One clinical study evaluated 
the PK and PD of baricitinib in paediatric patients (study JAIP). It should be noted that patients treated 
with  an OAT3 inhibitor  or who have renal impairment are to be treated with half the dose; thus 1 mg in 
patients weighing  <30 kg and 2 mg in patients weighing ≥30  kg. The 1 mg tablet was assessed and 
approved in the extension procedure EMEA/H/C/004085/X/0035/G. The tablet can be dissolved in 
water for patients who cannot swallow tablets, as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the PK of baricitinib in paediatric patients with atopic 
dermatitis (study JAIP). In the two-week open-label period, the PK was investigated in patients aged 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 25/110 
 
 
 
 
to <10  years receiving a dose of 2 mg once daily as oral suspension and patients aged 10 to <18 
years receiving a dose of 4 mg once daily as a tablet. During the double-blind treatment period, 
patients received 0.5 mg (lowest dose for patients aged 2 to <10 years), 1 mg (lowest dose for 
patients aged ≥10 years), 2 mg (highest dose for patients aged 2 to <10 years) or 4 mg (highest dose 
for patients aged ≥10 years). The PK aim of the study was to find a paediatric dose leading to similar 
exposure in paediatric patients as to that seen in the adult pivotal studies. The PK was determined per 
age category (2 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years and ≥10 years) and with a body weight cut-off (<30 kg 
and ≥30 kg). As a principle, the weight-based posology is endorsed.  
The same validated analytical method was used to  determine the plasma concentrations in  studies JAIP 
as in the initial  MAA. However, the Applicant used an additional new analytical technique for the 
analysis of baricitinib in whole dried bloodspot samples for study JAIP. Upon CHMP’s request, the 
Applicant provided information that the plasma and dried blood samples matched. Overall, the 
analytical methods appear sufficiently validated. 
The blood-to-plasma ratio in study JAIP was slightly higher than observed at MAA. The reason for the 
higher observed blood-to-plasma ratio is not known. However, since the number of dried blood 
samples is limited, the effect on the PK is most likely negligible and CHMP agrees that the difference is 
not meaningful.  
Baricitinib is mainly excreted via urine and predominately as the parent compound. Furthermore, Cmax 
and AUC increase dose-proportionally over the clinical dose range of 1 to 4 mg following single and 
multiple dosing. No  effect of age is expected in children aged 2 years and older; therefore, the 
approach of the Applicant to use the already developed PopPK model to determine the PK in juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis  patients aged 2 to <18 years is acceptable. The model appears to be able to predict 
the PK in atopic dermatitis patients aged 2 to <18 years. However, the model appeared not to be able 
to capture the elimination accurately. Upon CHMP’s request, the Applicant showed that observed and 
predicted PopPK data for greater than  or equal to 30 kg are reasonably concordant from 0 to 16 hours. 
There is a slight over-prediction of concentration from 16 to 30 hours. This is most likely due to a high 
number of trough samples with high observed concentrations, which the CHMP accepts. Therefore, the 
PopPK model can be used to predict the PK in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis. 
A total of 32 subjects were aged 2 to <6 years, 79 subjects were aged 6 to <10 years, and 281 
subjects were aged 10 to <18 years. The body weight ranged from 12 to 104 kg (mean was 46.6 kg). 
A total of 84 subjects had a body weight of <30 kg. The subjects had a mean body weight of 21.6 kg 
(range is 12.0-29.9  kg). A total of 308 subjects had a body weight of >30 kg with a mean body weight 
of 53.4 kg (range of 30.0-104 kg).  
The Applicant assumes that the disease is similar in adults and paediatric patients with atopic 
dermatitis and a similar exposure-response relationship is expected. Based on PopPK data, the Cmax is 
higher in paediatric patients with  atopic dermatitis weighing <30 kg and ≥30 kg compared to adult 
patients with  atopic dermatitis. In contrast, the AUC is lower in paediatric patients with atopic 
dermatitis weighing <30  kg and ≥30  kg compared to adults. Thus, the exposure does not appear to be 
similar in paediatric patients and adults. The higher Cmax in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis 
could lead to additional safety issues. In contrast, the lower AUC could lead to decreased efficacy.  
The exposure in paediatric patients weighing 10 to <20 kg is higher compared to adults with the 
proposed posology, and the probability of developing adverse events could increase. From modelling 
data, it appears that reducing the dose to 1 mg once daily would lead to too low exposure and could 
compromise efficacy in paediatric patients weighing 10 to <20 kg. However, due to the higher 
exposure of baricitinib 2 mg in these low weight children, the probability of developing adverse events 
could increase. Therefore, based on the available data the posology paediatric patients with AD 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 26/110 
 
 
 
weighing <30  kg is acceptable, as reflected in the section 4.2 of the SmPC. To follow-up the safety of 
AD paediatric patients weighing <30 kg, the Applicant agreed to include Study I4V-MC-JAIP (JAIP) 
(paediatric AD) as a category 3 study in the RMP. The Applicant also agreed to routinely monitor 
events reported from post-marketing sources and that any significant findings will be reported in 
Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). 
Pharmacodynamics 
PD analyses using biomarkers for efficacy or safety have not been performed. For efficacy, biomarkers 
are not considered needed, in the presence of (descriptive) exposure-response analyses with main 
clinical outcomes (IGA 0/1, EASI75, Itch NRS). The wide dose range used in the study JAIP (placebo, 
0,5 mg, 1 mg, 2  mg, 4 mg) leads to a wide range in exposure, which facilitates the interpretation of 
exposure-response analyses.  
For the total  group of patients, there was a clear exposure-response relationship between quartiles of 
baricitinib plasma concentrations (Cav,ss) and IGA 0 or 1, EASI75, and Itch NRS, at week 16. Based on 
PK results, the proposed dose recommendations for the SmPC are 2 mg for patients <30 kg and 4 mg 
if ≥30 kg. However, results differed per outcome when the exposure-response analyses were stratified 
by weight class (<30 kg or ≥30 kg). However, for the patients <30 kg only the IGA0/1 results 
(primary outcome) are clearly supportive. The results on EASI75 in the children <30 kg does not show 
a clear dose-response relationship, mainly due to a relatively high probability for response in the 
placebo group and a relatively low probability to reach response in the highest quartile of exposure. 
These EASI75 results in the <30 kg group may be caused by chance, due to the relatively low number 
of children <30 kg. Results on Itch were not available in the low weight class, because in younger 
patients (<10  years of age) another instrument was used (PRISM). Because of the absence of a clear 
dose-response relation for EASI75 and because there are no data on Itch NRS, there is a lack of 
supportive efficacy data in the <30 kg weight group. This lack of data is however mitigated by the 
results on IGA 0/1 (primary outcome) and by the fact that the concern about exposure in children <30 
kg is a relatively high dose, rather than too low a dose that could lead to reduced efficacy. Previous 
PK/PD analyses in adults with RA showed that AUC rather than Cmax drives efficacy, and in children 
weighing <30  kg the  AUC was considered more similar to the adult exposure than Cmax. Therefore, the 
exposure-response relationships support the dose in children <30 kg from the efficacy point of view. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib in paediatric patients with AD have been sufficiently characterised. 
The following posology in AD patients 2 years and older is endorsed by the CHMP: 2 mg dose once 
daily in patients weighing 10  kg to <30 kg and a dose of 4 mg once daily in patients with a body 
weight  of ≥30 kg. Further safety data in paediatric patients weighing <30 kg will be provided as a 
Category 3 PASS of the RMP and through routine monitoring by the Applicant. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No separate dose-response study has been performed. The dosing strategy for the ‘high dose’ (4 mg 
equivalent exposure to adults) was assessed using the PK lead-in period of study JAIP, and doses 
below the ‘high dose’ were tested in the subsequent randomised controlled period of study JAIP. This 
strategy had been agreed upon with PDCO.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
A phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, outpatient study 
evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in paediatric patients with moderate 
to-severe Atopic Dermatitis (I4V-MC-JAIP). 
Design 
Study I4V-MC-JAIP was designed as a ‘phase 3’, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo 
controlled, parallel-group, outpatient study evaluating the PK, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib 
compared with placebo in paediatric participants 2 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD. 
The study was divided into 5 periods: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
5-week screening period (Period 1) 
2 week, open-label PK lead-in period (Period 2) 
16-week, double-blind treatment period (Period 3) 
up to 4-year long-term extension period (Period 4) 
4-week post-treatment follow-up period (Period 5) 
Patients were enrolled in the randomised, double-blind study period (period 3), not until the results of 
the PK lead-in period (period 2) had confirmed the appropriate dose selection for the age group. For 
the double-blind part of the study, it  was planned that at least 440 participants  with moderate-severe 
AD would  be enrolled, with at least n=320 aged 10 to <18 years and n=120 participants aged 2 to 
<10 years old. Participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to placebo, baricitinib low-dose QD, medium-
dose QD, or high-dose QD. Accordingly, the daily doses for participants 10 to <18 years old were 4 
mg, 2 mg, and 1 mg; the doses for participants 2to <10 years old were 2 mg, 1 mg, and 0.5 mg. For 
patients <10  years of age, oral suspension was used, and patients ≥10 years of age were supplied 
with  tablets. Randomisation was stratified according to disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4). Background 
therapy with medium-potency and/or low-potency TCS and topical TCNI was permitted for use on 
active lesions until lesions were under control. The primary outcome was IGA 0 or 1 at week 16, 
EASI75 at week 16, and improvement ≥4 points in Itch NRS (patients ≥10 years only) at week 16, 
which were among the secondary outcomes adjusted for multiplicity. 
Patients who had completed study periods 2 or 3 were eligible to continue in the long-term extension 
period for up to 4 additional years of treatment (period 4). Period 5 was applied for patients who 
discontinued the study early or completed/will complete study period 4.  
Study participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to include paediatric patients with moderate-to-
severe AD who were candidates for systemic treatments. 
The main inclusion criteria were: 
•  Children aged 2 to <18 years with moderate-to-severe AD for 12 months or more in 
participants 6 years and older, and at least 6 months in children aged 2 to <6 years.

glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73  m2 (eGFR, calculated using Bedside 
Schwartz 2009 formula). 
Treatments 
Experimental treatment 
In the study, baricitinib (high,  medium, and low) doses QD were compared to placebo, as tablets for 
patients aged 10 years and older, and as oral suspension formulation in patients of 2 to <10 years. In 
addition, dose strength was stratified by the age cut-off of 10 years. 
Patients 10 to  <18 years old allocated to the high dose received baricitinib 4 mg QD tablets and 
placebo tablets matching 2 mg and 1 mg baricitinib. Likewise, patients allocated to the medium dose 
received baricitinib 2 mg QD and matching placebo for 4 mg and 1 mg, and patients allocated to the 
low dose received baricitinib 1 mg and matching placebo tablets for 4 mg and 2 mg. Patients allocated 
to placebo received three placebo tablets matching the baricitinib strengths. Tablets for blinded 
treatment were packed in blister packs with 3 tablets a day. Open-label investigational product tablets 
were provided in bottles. 
Patients 2 to <10  years old allocated to the high dose received 2mg QD oral suspension formulation (1 
ml per day). Likewise, patients allocated to the medium dose received 1 mg oral suspension (0.5 ml a 
day), and patients allocated to the low dose received 0.5 mg oral suspension (0.25 ml a day). 
Accordingly, patients allocated to placebo received 1 ml, 0.5 ml, or 0.25 ml of placebo oral suspension 
formulation, matching baricitinib  oral suspension. Baricitinib oral suspension (2-mg/mL baricitinib) or 
matching placebo was supplied as a ready-to-use oral suspension in a bottle to be administered using 
an oral syringe. 
Treatment compliance 
Patient compliance with study medication was assessed at each visit after baseline. Patients treated 
with  baricitinib or placebo were considered noncompliant if they missed >20% of the prescribed doses 
during the study (unless the investigator withheld  the study medication for safety reasons). Patients 
found to be non-compliant were assessed to determine the reason for noncompliance and educated 
and/or managed as deemed appropriate to improve compliance. 
Concomitant treatment 
Daily use of emollients was required. However, when daily applications were missed, it was not 
considered a protocol violation.  
Stable use of antihistamines was allowed, and downward dose adjustments or discontinuation of 
antihistamines was permitted. 
Patients received sponsor-provided TCS (triamcinolone 0.1% cream or equivalent-potency TCS and 
hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment or equivalent-potency TCS) at screening. TCS was to be used on active 
lesions as prescribed by the investigator. After baseline, TCS should continue to be applied to affected 
areas as clinically indicated until lesions are under control (clear or almost clear). TCS was then 
tapered and stopped as clinically indicated. In the long-term extension period (period 4), TCS was 
permitted in all potencies. 
The use of TCNIs (e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) or a topical PDE-4 inhibitor (i.e., crisaborole, 
where approved) were permitted in areas where the application of TCS is considered inappropriate by 
the investigator (e.g., face, neck, skin folds, genital areas, etc.). Like for TCS, TCNI was tapered and 
stopped as clinically indicated.

To allow for adequate assessment of skin dryness, patients were asked not to apply emollients or TCS 
(TCNI, PDE-4i)  on the day of their study visit prior to the procedures. 
If lesions reappeared, the patients should resume the application of TCS, TCNI or PDE-4 inhibitor as 
described above. 
Rescue treatment 
In the randomised, double-blind period (Period 3), patients whose lesions persisted or worsened 
despite the use of emollients and low- and/or medium-potency TCS were eligible for topical rescue 
with  high- or ultra-high-potency TCS. Patients whose disease was still not controlled could be rescued 
to systemic therapies (conventional systemics or biologics), which required discontinuation of 
experimental treatment (continuing the study was encouraged). 
Prohibited treatment 
The treatment with  investigational product should be discontinued when prohibited treatments were 
started: live vaccines, systemic corticosteroids, any systemic therapy used as AD rescue, probenecid. 
Treatment discontinuation 
For abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regardless of relatedness), specific guidance was 
provided for temporarily interrupting  treatment and when treatment  may be restarted Table 6. 
Table 6. Criteria for the temporary interruption and resumption of investigational treatment. 
Investigational treatment should be permanently  discontinued when there is suspicion for liver 
damage based on laboratory values (e.g. ALT or AST >8× ULN or ALT or AST >5× ULN for more than 
2 weeks), and in case of other abnormalities in laboratory values (white blood cell count <1000 
cells/μL (1.00x103/μL  or 1.00  GI/L); ANC <500 cells/μL (0.50x103/μL  or 0.50  GI/L); lymphocyte 
count <200  cells/μL (0.20x103/μL  or 0.20 GI/L); haemoglobin <6.5 g/dL  (<65.0  g/L). Also in case of 
pregnancy, malignancy, HBV positivity, VTE, investigational treatment was permanently discontinued.

Objectives 
The efficacy objective of the randomised placebo-controlled period was to analyse whether there was 
superiority of each dose of baricitinib versus placebo in the treatment of paediatric patients >2 years 
of age with moderate-to-severe AD.  
Further objectives were to: characterise the PK profile of baricitinib in paediatric participants with AD; 
assess the participant acceptability and palatability of baricitinib tablets and oral suspension; evaluate 
the potential  effects of baricitinib on the cellular and humoral immune system; assess the efficacy of 
baricitinib during longer-term treatment; assess growth and bone safety of baricitinib during longer-
term treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary  endpoint was the proportion of patients with  a vIGA-AD score  of 0 or 1 (clear or 
almost clear skin) with  at least a 2-point  improvement at 16  weeks. The IGA is a commonly used scale 
in clinical trials in adult  and paediatric patients 25, 26. The score is based on an overall assessment of the 
degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification, and is scored from 4 
(severe disease) to 0 (clear skin).

excoriation, and lichenification, each on a scale of 0 to 3 (Hanifin et al. 2001). The EASI is a 
validated scale in patients down to 2 months of age (Barbier 2004). 
• 
The proportion of patients achieving a 75% improvement on the SCORAD (SCORAD75) at 16 
weeks. The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index is an investigator-rated assessment 
that  uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characteristics: 
erythema, oedema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness. The 
SCORAD index also includes patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss (VAS). 
(Stalder and Taieb 1993; Oranje 2007) 
• 
The proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥4-points in Itch NRS at 1 week, 2 
weeks, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks for patients ≥10 years old. The Itch NRS is a patient-assessed, 
11-point  horizontal scale anchored at 0 (‘no itch’) and 10 (‘worst itch imaginable’) (Naegeli 
2015;  Kimball 2016). 
Other secondary  endpoints, not adjusted for multiplicity, included: 
•  Mean change from baseline in BSA affected at 16 weeks. The BSA is derived from the EASI 
assessment. 
• 
The proportion of participants developing skin infections requiring antibiotic treatment by 
Week 16. 
•  Mean change in the PRISM  at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks for participants <10 
years old. The Parent-Reported Itch Severity Measure (PRISM) is a single-item, 
parent/caregiver-administered scale on the overall severity of their child’s itching. Assessment 
is based on observed actions of the child in the past 24 hours. Response options range from 
‘No Itch’, over ‘Mild’, ‘Moderate’ and ‘Severe’ to ‘Very Severe’.  
• 
The mean number of days without the use of background TCS over 16 weeks and mean gram 
quantity  of TCS used over 16 weeks (tube weights). The use of TCS is assessed using a daily 
diary to record if a patient has applied a TCS to the skin in the last 24 hours. 
•  Mean change from baseline in the total score of the POEM at 16 weeks. The Patient-Oriented 
Eczema Measure (POEM) is a 7-item, patient-administered scale to assess disease severity in 
children and adults. Items ask about the frequency of 7 symptoms (itching, sleep disturbance, 
bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week 
(Charman et al. 2004). Response categories include 0 (‘no days’), 1 (‘2 days’), 2 (‘3-4 days’), 
3 (‘5-6  days’), 4 ‘every day’). The POEM is a validated scale in patients down to 1 year of age 
(Charman et al. 2004). 
•  Mean changes from baseline in the PROMIS-paediatric depression and the PROMIS-paediatric 
anxiety at 16 weeks. The PROMIS Depression Short Form and the Anxiety Short Form are 
available in a paediatric self-report(ages 8 to <18  years) and for parents/caregivers serving as 
proxy reporters for their children(youth ages ≥5 years). Children aged <5 years will not 
complete this assessment. Both versions assess depression/anxiety “in the past seven days.” 
Response options range from 1 (‘Never’) to  5 (‘Almost always’). Total raw scores are converted 
to T-Scores with higher scores representing greater depression or anxiety. 
•  Mean change in CDLQI/IDQOL  scores at 16 weeks. The Children’s Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (CDLQI) is a patient-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire 
that  is designed for use in children ≥4 years old that covers 6 domains including symptoms and 
feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment (Lewis-Jones 
and Finlay 1995).  The recall period is over the last week. Response categories range from 0 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023

(‘not at  all’) to 3 (‘very much’). A CDLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect 
on a child’s life (Waters et al. 2010). The Infant’s Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) is a 
caregiver-administered, 11-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that is designed 
for use in paediatric patients <4 years old with AD (Lewis-Jones et al. 2001; Basra et al. 
2013). 
•  Acceptability  and tolerability of the baricitinib  tablet and oral suspension were assessed in the 
PK lead-in period, at baseline (visit 2, after dosing) and after about 2 weeks of dosing (visit 4). 
Tablet acceptability was assessed using a self-completed questionnaire to assess the study 
participant’s ability to swallow the  tablet in patients  of 10  years and older, who received tablets 
in the trial.  The questionnaire for suspension acceptability and palatability assessed the study 
participant’s experience of taste and smell of the suspension and ease of administering and 
taking the suspension  27, 28. The questionnaire was completed by parents or caregivers for 
children 2 to <10  years of age who received the suspension formulation. 
Sample size 
For the randomised placebo-controlled period of study JAIP, it was aimed to enrol at least 440 
patients 2 to  <18 years of age; at least n=320 patients (10 to<18 years) and at least n=120 patients 
(2 to <10  years). The proposed sample size (N=440) will ensure a >95% power to detect any 
difference between the baricitinib high dose and placebo treatment groups or the baricitinib medium 
dose and placebo treatment groups, each using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, assuming a 10% placebo, 
25% medium dose, and 30% high dose response rate for the primary endpoint using a chi-squared 
test. The assumptions are based on the effects in the adult phase 2 study (JAHG) for the primary 
endpoint of IGA 0 or 1at week 16. IGA 0 or 1 represents an AD outcome of clear or almost clear skin, 
coming from a baseline of moderate or severe disease. The anticipated effect size represents 3 times 
more patients achieving this benefit compared to placebo. 
In older paediatric patients (≥10 years of age), the sample size of 320 is sufficient to detect that the 
baricitinib high  or medium dose is superior to placebo at least 80% of the time. 
Sample size estimates were calculated using nQuery® Advisor 7.0 for the older subgroup of patients, 
and power estimates were obtained from R 3.5.0 and JAGS 4.2.0 for the younger subgroup of patients. 
Randomisation 
For the randomised placebo-controlled part of the study (Period 3), assignment to treatment groups 
was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive web-response system 
(IWRS). The IWRS was used to assign blister packs or bottles containing double-blind investigational 
product to each patient. Site personnel had to confirm that the correct blister packs or bottles were 
located, by entering a confirmation number found on the blister packs or bottles into the IWRS. 
Randomisation was stratified by disease severity at baseline (IGA 3 versus 4) and by region.

Blinding (masking) 
The experimental treatment was provided to the patient/caregivers by the investigator. For patients 10 
to <18  years old, the double-blind investigational product included 3 tablets per day provided in blister 
packs. Each tablet (4-mg versus 2-mg versus 1-mg) has a distinctive shape and colour, and each 
strength tablet  has a matching placebo. For patients 2 to <10 years old, baricitinib oral suspension 
(containing 2-mg/mL  baricitinib) or matching placebo was supplied as a ready-to-use oral suspension 
in a bottle to  be administered using an oral syringe.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses 
The tests of treatment effects were generally conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  
Treatment comparisons between baricitinib and placebo of discrete efficacy variables, including the 
primary outcome, were made using logistic regression analysis with region, disease severity, age, 
treatment group, and treatment group-by-age interaction in the model. The percentages, difference in 
percentages, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in percentages were reported. 
Treatment-by-age interaction was added to the logistic regression model of the primary and key 
secondary variables as a sensitivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2-sided 0.1 level, 
further inspection was used to assess whether the interaction is quantitative (i.e., the treatment effect 
is consistent in direction but  not size of effect) or qualitative (the treatment is beneficial for some but 
not all age groups). The p-value from the Fisher exact test will also be produced. 
For analysing treatment effects of continuous outcomes over time, a restricted maximum likelihood-
based mixed-effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) was used. The model included treatment, 
age cohort, region, baseline severity, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, and treatment-by-age 
cohort interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction 
as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between- 
and within-patient  errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures were tested.  The Kenward–
Roger method was used to estimate the degrees of freedom. Type III sums of squares for the least 
squares means (LSMs) was used for the statistical comparison; 95% CI were also reported. Contrasts 
were set up within the  model to test treatment groups at specific time points of interest. 
Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables could also be made using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with region, disease severity, treatment group, and baseline value in 
the model. Type III tests for LSM were used for statistical comparison between treatment groups. The 
LSM difference, standard error, p-value, and 95% CI were reported.  
Safety analyses 
Fisher’s exact test was used for the AEs, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data for 
between-treatment group comparisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuous 
safety variables, including laboratory variables, were analysed by an ANCOVA with treatment and 
baseline value in the model.  
Missing data imputation 
1. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for all patients who discontinued the study or the study 
treatment at any time for any reason for analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI 
50/75/90  after discontinuation and onward.  
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 35/110 
 
 
 
2. Continuous  variables such as EASI and SCORAD scores were assumed to be missing after rescue or 
discontinuation,  and then an MMRM  analysis was performed. 
3. Last observed carried forward (LOCF) was performed, using the last observed value on or prior to 
discontinuation  or rescue therapy. This was analysed using a logistic model for categorical variables or 
ANCOVA for continuous variables, as described above. 
Censoring 
The efficacy analyses used 3 prespecified censoring rules: 
• 
Primary censoring 
o censored efficacy data after rescue 
o censored efficacy data after permanent discontinuation of the study treatment 
•  Secondary censoring 
o did not censor efficacy data after rescue 
o censored efficacy data after permanent discontinuation of the study treatment 
• 
Tertiary censoring 
o censored efficacy data after any using any medication considered rescue medication even if 
not used for AD rescue (e.g., oral prednisone used for allergic reaction). 
o censored efficacy data after permanent discontinuation of the study treatment. 
All efficacy endpoints were analysed using the primary censoring rule. The secondary censoring rule 
was applied to primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints as a sensitivity analysis. The tertiary 
censoring rule was used as an additional sensitivity analysis and was applied to selected primary and 
secondary categorial endpoints (IGA 0/1, EASI75, SCORAD75, Itch NRS 4-pointreduction). 
Adjustment for Multiple  Comparisons 
Multiplicity  controlled analyses were performed on the primary and key secondary endpoints to control 
the overall family-wise Type I error rate at a 2-sided α level of 0.05, using a graphical multiple testing 
procedure 29. For the primary objective, the alpha was split, with baricitinib high dose receiving 0.049 
and baricitinib medium dose receiving 0.001 to start, and baricitinib low dose receiving recycled alpha 
based on prior results in the testing scheme. This procedure made no multiplicity adjustments for 
other secondary endpoints.

Results 
Participant flow 
ITT population 
For the randomised placebo-controlled part of the study (Period 3), 538 potential study participants 
were screened, and 483 were randomised to investigational treatment (Figure 7). (One participant 
allocated to  baricitinib low-dose was inadvertently randomised and discontinued from the study prior to 
the first dose.) The participants were equally divided into four treatment groups: high dose, medium 
dose, low dose, and placebo.

Figure 7. Participant flow in  the randomised placebo-controlled part of study JAIP 
The completion rates range from 94% in the placebo group to 99% in the high-dose group. In the 
high-dose group, there was one withdrawal due to an AE; in the placebo group there were most (n=4) 
withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. Of the 16 study discontinuations, 6 were in patients <10 years old, 
spread over treatment groups. The numbers of treatment discontinuations by treatment group before 
end of the randomised phase (week 16), without discontinuing the study, were not reported. 
Extended population 
Patients who had at least some response (IGA 0, 1 or 2) at week 16, continued on their allocated 
treatment (high  dose, medium dose, low dose, placebo). Patients with an insufficient response or with 
rescue treatment switched to open-label treatment with baricitinib high  dose. At the interim data cut-
off (20 June 2022),  48% of participants randomly assigned to high dose were ongoing on their initial 
treatment, compared with 38% for medium dose, 33% for low dose, and 32% for placebo (Figure 8). 
Among participants in the Extended population, a lower proportion of participants randomly assigned 
to baricitinib  high dose (3.3%) and medium dose (3.3%) discontinued study treatment compared with 
low dose (7.5%) and placebo (8.2%).

Recruitment 
Enrolment in study JAIP started on 24 May 2019 (first patient  first visit) and was completed for the 
randomised part on 24 April 2022 (last patient last visit). The extension study is still ongoing and will 
continue for 4 years. 
Of the 483 patients  enrolled in the placebo-controlled part of the study, 38% were recruited in 
European centers (Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Spain, United 
Kingdom), 7.8% were recruited in Japan, and 55% in the rest-of-the world (Australia, India, Israel, 
Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol changes 
The initial protocol was approved in September 2018 and changed two times: on 12 June 2019 
(version a) and 6 August 2020 (version b). The main changes in version a were: instead of 
monotherapy of experimental treatment on top of emollients, low- and medium-potency TCS would 
additionally be used as background treatment in study periods 3 and 4; instead of needing IGA 0 or 1 
to remain on the interventional treatment from period 3 in period 4 a IGA 0,1 or 2 would qualify. The 
main changes in version b were: the addition of knee imaging and increased frequency of hand x-ray 
requirements for monitoring bone growth, and clarification of assessment of any symptomatic areas of 
bones/joints were included based on regulatory feedback. The duration of the long-term follow-up 
study was extended from 2 years to 4 years. 
Protocol violations 
Among study participants randomised in the double-blind treatment period, 98 (20%) participants had 
at least 1 important protocol deviation. There were 29 participants with eligibility violations, most often 
body weight below 5th percentile of age (n=11) and missing laboratory data prior to randomisation 
(n=12).  There were 18 violations concerning investigational product: incorrect randomisation (n=1) 
and significant non-compliance (n=17). There was 1 safety violation, a SAE was not reported <24

hours. There were 63 violations concerning study procedures, most often missing baseline values of 
imaging procedures (n=23), missing DFI questionnaire by caregivers (n=32), e-diary non-compliance 
(n=11). 
Impact of COVID-19 
Study enrolment was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the primary endpoint at week 
16,  disruptions due to COVID-19  were primarily delayed visits or the need for telephone visits 
resulting in missing procedures. No participants discontinued from the study due to a COVID-19 
infection or had to be excluded from the PP set due to COVID-19 induced protocol violations. 
Inspections and audits 
GCP audits have been performed by the sponsor in 4 centers (in Taiwan, Poland, Russia, Japan). It 
was not declared whether or not GCP inspections have been performed. 
Baseline data 
At baseline of the placebo-controlled period, demographic characteristics (age, sex, Caucasian-ness, 
height and weight,  region), time since AD diagnosis, and baseline disease severity (IGA, EASI, BSA, 
Itch) were numerically equal across the 4 treatment groups (Table 8). In the youngest age group (2 to 
<10 years of age), there were n=34 patients randomised to placebo and n=32 to the ‘high dose’. In 
the oldest age group (10 to <18 years of age), there were n=88 patients randomised to placebo and 
n=88  to the ‘high dose’. 
Also when  stratified by age (2 to <10  years and 10 to  <18 years), baseline variables were similar over 
treatment groups. 
A small majority of participants (62%) had an IGA score of 3, while the others (38%) had an IGA of 4. 
The mean (SD) EASI score was 26 (9.7), BSA affected was 41% (18%), and Itch NRS was 5.4 (2.6).  
The most common pre-existing disorders were allergic rhinitis (41%), food allergy (33%), 
hypersensitivity (30%), asthma (28%), seasonal allergy (23%), drug hypersensitivity (20%), and 
allergic conjunctivitis (13%), equally divided over treatment groups.

Table 8. Baseline characteristics of the placebo-controlled period of study JAIP 
Before baseline, virtually all (99%) of patients had used TCS and usually (89%) had an insufficient 
response, while 2.9% had an intolerance to TCS (Table 9). Most (87%) of the patients had used TCNI, 
with  83% having an insufficient response and 14% having had an intolerance to TCNI. The 4 patients 
who did not  use TCS before baseline, had used systemic treatments.

Numbers analysed 
In the ITT population of the placebo-controlled study, N=483 participants were included; with n=133 
participants (28%)  of 2 to <10 years and n=350 participants of 10 to <18 years. In the PP set, N=462 
participants were included due to not having any important protocol violation, n=21 participants were 
excluded from the PP set (n=4 on placebo, n=7 on low dose, n=6 on medium dose, n=4 on high 
dose). 
There were N=7 patients entering the 4 week follow-up period (Period 5), while they did not enter the 
long term extension study. 
Exposure, compliance, and rescue 
Exposure 
In the 16 weeks placebo-controlled period (112 days), the exposure was similar across the baricitinib 
treatment groups (~114  days) and on average 2 days less in the placebo group (Table 10).

Table 10. Exposure by treatment group in the placebo-controlled period of study JAIP 
Compliance 
Compliance that was less than 80% of the treatment regimen over the placebo-controlled period (0-16 
weeks) was defined as non-compliance. Overall, treatment compliance was >95%. The proportions of 
patients with  non-compliance was 2.3% in the placebo group (tablets only, compliance to placebo 
solution not  given), 5.0% in the low dose group, and 3.3% in each of the medium dose and high dose 
groups. 
Rescue 
During  the placebo-controlled period, there were 10 (8.2%) patients who got rescue therapy in the 
placebo group, as compared to 7 (5.8%) patients in the low dose group, 3 (2.5%) in the medium dose 
group, and 4 (3.3%) in  the high dose group. Six patients were rescued within 2 weeks, 2 of them in 
the placebo group, 2 in the low dose group, and 1 in each of the medium dose and high dose groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Graphical testing procedure 
Within  the framework of the graphical testing procedure, treatment effects of baricitinib high dose 
were statistical significantly different as compared with placebo, on all 16-week key efficacy endpoints 
as well as the Itch NRS 4-point improvement at 4 weeks (Figure 9). Treatment effects of the baricitinib 
medium and low doses versus placebo, were not statistically significant on any of the study endpoints.

At week 16, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 was 42% in the high dose (4 mg equivalent) 
group, as compared to 16% in the placebo group (p<0.0001) in the ITT population (Table 11). 
Treatment effects in the medium and low-dose groups were not statistically significantly different from 
the placebo group. In the medium dose group, there were 26% patients with IGA 0 or 1 (p=0.072), 
and in the low dose group, there were 18% (p=0.73) responders with IGA 0 or 1. 
Table 11. IGA 0 or 1 with a ≥2 point improvement at week 16 (primary outcome) in the placebo-
controlled phase of study JAIP 
In the 4 planned sensitivity analyses, the treatment effect in IGA 0 or 1 of the high dose as compared 
to placebo remained statistically significant: in the ITT population with secondary censoring and non-
responder imputation (p<0.0001);  the ITT population with  tertiary censoring and non-responder 
imputation  (p<0.0001);  the PP-set with  primary censoring and non-responder imputation (p<0.0001); 
in the IIT population with  primary censoring and placebo multiple imputation (p=0.001).

Over time, from baseline to week 16, the treatment effects in the high dose group were larger than in 
the medium dose group and the low dose and placebo groups (Figure 10).

Key secondary outcomes 
At week 16, there was a (multiplicity adjusted) statistically significant treatment  effect of baricitinib 
high dose (4 mg equivalent), as compared to placebo, in EASI75, EASI90, SCORAD75, EASI change 
from baseline, and Itch NRS ≥4 points improvement (Table 12).

Table 12. Primary and key secondary endpoints at week 16 in the placebo-controlled phase of study 
JAIP 
Over time, from baseline to week 16, the proportions of responders in EASI75, EASI90 (Figure 11) 
and SCORAD75 (not  shown) in the high  dose group were higher than the responses in the medium, 
low dose and placebo groups. At week 4, the difference in ≥4 points improvement in Itch NRS was 
(multiplicity  adjusted) statistically significant (p=0.0026),  with  7.3% in the placebo group and 32% in 
the high dose group (Figure 12). The results of the pre-planned sensitivity analyses of the key 
secondary outcomes (EASI75, EASI90, SCORAD75, change in EASI, Itch NRS response≥4) were in line 
with  the results from the primary analyses.

Other secondary outcomes 
The other secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiplicity. 
The mean change in %BSA affected  was statistically significantly (p=0.014)  larger in the ‘high dose’ 
group with  -26% as compared to placebo with -20%. The BSA is integrated in the EASI. 
The PRISM  is a single-item, parent- or caregiver-administered scale to rate the overall severity of 
their child’s itching,  completed for participants <10 years old. At week 16, the LS mean (SE) change 
from baseline in PRISM score was -0.28 (0.16) in the high dose group and 0.02 (0.15) in the placebo 
group (p=0.12).  At week 16, the mean (SE) change in the medium dose group was -0.44 (p=0.015) 
and -0.19 (p=0.27)  in  the low dose group.  
At week 16, 3 (2.5%) of patients  on ‘high dose’ had skin infections requiring antibiotic treatment 
versus 7 (5.7%) on placebo, which was not a statistically significant (p=0.30)  difference. 
TCS  use, calculated as the median (P25 – P75) number of days that TCS was not used during the 16 
weeks (112 days) of the placebo-controlled period, was 11 (1 – 55) days in the placebo group, and 25 
(2 – 78)  in the high dose group (p=0.16, based on parametric testing). TCS use was also calculated as 
the amount of drug used during the placebo-controlled period. The median difference in TCS use for 
baricitinib high  dose versus placebo was -82 gr (p=0.014), mainly due to a reduction in medium-
potency corticosteroids in the high dose group. 
The POEM  is a 7-item, participant-reported scale (0-28) to assess symptom severity. At baseline, the 
mean (SD) POEM score was 14 (6.8) in the placebo group and 15 (6.9) in the baricitinib high  dose 
group. At week 16, the mean (SD) change from baseline in POEM was -3.6 (7.5) in the placebo group, 
as compared to – 5.3 (8.4) in the baricitinib high  dose group (p=0.0496). 
The IDQOL  and  CDLQI  are, respectively caregiver reported and self-reported questionnaires to 
assess the impact on the patient’s daily living due to skin disorders. There were no statistically 
significant differences in change from baseline for the PROMIS depression and anxiety subscales 
between placebo and baricitinib high dose. 
The PROMIS  has a subscale for depression and for anxiety and is self-completed or by care-givers. 
There were no statistically significant differences in change from baseline for the PROMIS depression 
and anxiety subscales, between placebo and baricitinib high dose. 
Maintenance 
Patients with  at least some response (IGA 0, 1 or 2) at week 16 of the placebo-controlled randomised 
period, continued on the treatment they were originally allocated to (Table 13). More patients from the 
high dose group continued on their original dose (n=81) as compared to the lower dose groups and 
placebo (n=57). At week 20 the proportion of responders (IGA 0 or 1) was 43% in the placebo group, 
and 51% in the  high dose group. At week 52 the proportion of responders was 40% in the placebo 
group and 47% in the high  dose group. Similar trends were seen when analysing EASI-75. 
The non-responders (IGA 3 or 4) at week 16 who were originally allocated to high dose, remained on 
high dose while being transferred to the open-label phase. Of these non-responding patients, no 
(0/38)  patients had a response at week 20, 8% had a response (IGA 0 or 1) at week 24, and 17% at 
week 52.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroups 
The predefined subgroup analysis using the IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (primary outcome) as an endpoint, 
showed that none of the interaction terms were statistically significant (p<0.10);  (Table 14). Also, 
when EASI75 at week 16 was used as an endpoint, none of the interaction terms were significant 
(p<0.10),  which includes age.

Dose was stratified by age (cut-off 10 years) in the trial, but the MAH proposed a weight-based (cut-
off 30 kg) dose stratification for the SmPC. The treatment effect in IGA 0 or 1 in the high dose group, 
as compared to placebo, was numerically smaller in children weighing 30 kg who were on 2 mg, as 
compared to children and adolescents weighing ≥30kg who were on 4 mg (Figure 13). In both weight 
groups there was a visible dose-response relationship.

Acceptability and palatability 
Acceptability and tolerability of the baricitinib tablet and oral suspension were assessed in the PK lead-
in period, at baseline (visit 2, after dosing) and after about 2 weeks of dosing (visit 4).

For participants in the  PK lead-in period 10 years of age and older who received tablets (N=20), the 
majority of responses (95%) reported that the study medication (4 mg tablet) was ‘very easy’ to 
swallow. 
For participants in the  PK lead-in period <10  years of age who received the oral suspension (N=13), all 
of the parent or caregiver responses (100%) reported that the study medication was ‘easy’ or ‘very 
easy’ for the parent or caregiver to administer and the participant to take. The majority of parent or 
caregiver responses (73%) reported that the participant ‘liked’ or ‘liked very much’ the taste of the 
oral suspension whereas 58% reported that the participant ‘liked’ or‘ liked very much’ the smell of the 
oral suspension and 42% ‘neither liked or disliked’ the smell of the oral suspension.

aThe study was carried out using an ITT population defined as all randomly assigned participants for the efficacy 
analyses. The primary efficacy measure was the binary outcome of response defined as an IGA score of 0 or 1 
(clear or almost clear) with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 16. Given the sample size and a nonresponder 
imputation method for missing data, the planned sample size (N = 440 with 1:1:1:1 randomisation) would ensure 
a >95% power to detect any difference between the baricitinib high dose and placebo groups or the baricitinib 
medium dose and placebo groups, each using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, assuming a 10% placebo, 25% medium 
dose, and 30% high dose response  rate for the primary endpoint. Participants who were rescued or discontinued 
treatment were considered nonresponders.  Treatment group comparisons  for binary efficacy response measures 
were analysed using a logistic regression. 
bMMRM  in the ITT population: continuous secondary  measures of efficacy were analysed using MMRM 
methodology.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
Clinical program 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for paediatric AD includes one global clinical study 
(I4V-MC-JAIP)  for evaluating the PK, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in paediatric patients 2 to <18 
years with moderate-to-severe AD. 
No separate dose-response study has been performed. The dosing strategy for the ‘high dose’ (4 mg 
equivalent exposure to adults) was assessed using the PK lead-in period of study JAIP, and doses 
below the ‘high dose’ were tested in the subsequent randomised controlled period of study JAIP. This 
strategy had been agreed with  PDCO in the PIP. The dosing in the study JAIP was based on an age cut-
off of 10  years. Based on the  PK results of the study JAIP, the proposed dose recommendations for the 
SmPC are 2 mg for patients <30 kg and 4 mg if ≥30 kg (see PK discussion). 
Study JAIP included a 2-week, open-label PK lead-in period, a 16-week, double-blind treatment period, 
and an up to 4-year long-term extension period. In the placebo-controlled part of the study JAIP, 
participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to placebo, baricitinib low-dose QD, medium-dose QD, or high-
dose QD. Accordingly, the daily doses for participants 10 to <18 years old were 4 mg, 2 mg, and 1

mg; the doses for participants 2 to <10 years old were 2 mg, 1 mg, and 0.5 mg. For patients <10 
years of age, oral suspension was used, and patients ≥10 years of age were supplied with tablets. 
In practice, patients <10 years may also be able to swallow tablets. However, for patients not able to 
swallow tablets, the  oral solution used in the clinical programme is not available. In the X-35-G line 
extension submission, the MAH demonstrated the bioequivalence of the 2 mg/mL oral solution versus 
the 4 mg commercial tablet together with the option  of tablet dispersion in water for patients who are 
not able to swallow tablets. 
Study design 
The basic design elements of study JAIP, including selection strategy for the ‘high dose’ regimen, the 
inclusion of a low dose and a moderate baricitinib dose and the use of placebo, the 16 week timing of 
the placebo-controlled phase, adopting IGA 0 or 1 as the primary outcome, and EASI75, SCORAD75 
and Itch NRS as (multiplicity adjusted) key secondary outcomes, allowance for concomitant TCS, the 
follow-up with  an open-label extension phase, was agreed with PDCO as laid down in the PIP and its 
modification.  
Patient population 
The selected study population is in line with the target population  of ‘moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older who are candidates for systemic therapy’. 
The inclusion criteria follow expectations and were agreed upon with the PDCO as laid down in the PIP. 
The exclusion criteria are essentially in line with the posology and warnings in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Endpoints  and outcomes 
The primary outcome was IGA 0 or 1 at week 16, EASI75 at week 16, and improvement ≥4 points in 
Itch NRS (patients ≥10 years only) at week 16, were among the secondary outcomes adjusted for 
multiplicity.  The main efficacy outcomes are established assessment instruments for use in AD. These 
outcomes and the 16-week duration of the trial were also used in the adult trials for moderate-severe 
AD. The Itch NRS was used in children of 10 years and older, which is endorsed. In younger patients, 
itch was assessed by the caregiver using the PRISM instrument, which is not fully validated yet and 
therefore was not considered a key secondary outcome.  
Treatment 
Background therapy with medium-potency and/or low-potency TCS and topical TCNI was permitted for 
use on active lesions until lesions were under control. Use of TCS background treatment is acceptable, 
as this will be close to the practical use that can be envisaged and was agreed by PDCO (EMEA-C-
001220-PIP03-16-M01).   
Sample size and randomisation 
For the randomised placebo-controlled period of study JAIP, it was aimed to enrol at least 440 patients 
2 to <18  years of age; at least n=320 patients (10 to <18 years) and at least n=120 patients (2 to 
<10 years). The sample size estimations were based on the available information of the adult phase 2 
trial, which  is reasonable. The younger age group may not be large enough for the treatment effects 
reaching statistical significance within that  stratum,  but that  is considered not needed.  
The stratified randomisation procedure methods to preserve blinding were appropriately designed. 
While baricitinib tablets  of 4 mg, 2 mg and 1 mg differ in colour, shape and size, matching placebos 
were made, and each participant in the placebo-controlled phase took 3 tablets a day. For the oral 
solution, a matching placebo solution was provided. 
Statistical analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 56/110 
 
 
 
The approach for statistical analysis is standard and acceptable and is similar to the approach followed 
in earlier studies (JAHL, JAHM,  JAIY, etc.). The primary censoring rule is agreed upon for primary 
analyses, and the secondary and tertiary rules are sensitivity analyses. The treatment comparisons for 
the primary secondary outcomes are adjusted for multiple comparisons, which is agreed. However, 
almost all alpha is spent on the high dose, which assumes an a priori large trust in the efficacy of the 
high dose over the medium dose and gives a small a priori probability for the medium dose to reach 
statistical  significance (not pursued). A posteriori, the high dose showed larger treatment effects 
versus placebo, as compared to the medium dose.  
Performance 
Although important  protocol changes have been performed shortly after first-patient-first-visit, 
regarding including TCS as background treatment and regarding eligibility to the continuation of 
randomised treatment after week 16 of IGA 0,1 or 2, the influence on overall results is considered 
minimal. The timing of protocol change b will have caused the missing imaging data at baseline, which 
consider monitoring of growth and bone safety. The telephone visits performed due to Covid19 did not 
include the week 16 visit, in which the  primary outcome was assessed through physical examination. 
Therefore, Covid-19 did not appear to have influenced the main results of the study. Among study 
participants randomised in the double-blind treatment period, 98 (20%) participants  had at least 1 
important protocol deviation. Most of the important  protocol violations concerned missing data, not 
necessarily of the main outcomes. It is endorsed that not all patients with an important protocol 
violation are excluded from the PP-set. The MAH informed that 4 routine investigator site audits had 
been performed, of which summary data were submitted and assessed. There were no audit findings 
with  major consequences for the submitted data. The results of 2 routine inspections of sites in France 
were not yet available. 
Similarity at baseline 
At baseline of the placebo-controlled period, demographic characteristics (age, sex, Caucasian-ness, 
height and weight,  region), time since AD diagnosis, and baseline disease severity (IGA, EASI, BSA, 
Itch) were similar across the 4 treatment groups. Baseline differences in sex (~8% less females in the 
high dose group) and Itch NRS (~0.9 points lower in placebo group) are of no concern. The baseline 
disease characteristics were in line with a target population with moderate to severe AD, who are 
candidates for systemic treatment:  Overall, a small majority of participants (62%) had an IGA score of 
3, while the  others (38%) had an IGA of 4; the mean (SD) EASI score was 26 (9.7), BSA affected was 
41% (18%),  and Itch NRS was 5.4 (2.6);  many patients had atopic/allergic comorbidities. With one 
exception for EASI (protocol violation), all patients had scores above the inclusion criterion. Virtually all 
patients (99%)  had used TCS, and a large majority (87%) had used TCNI before, usually with an 
insufficient response. A considerable proportion of patients had used systemic corticosteroids (26%) or 
immunosuppressants (22%), biologics were infrequently used before (2.1%). 
Patient flow 
In the 16-week placebo-controlled phase, more patients in the placebo (8.2%) and low dose (5.8%) 
groups needed rescue, as compared to the medium (2.5%) and high dose (3.3%) groups.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall effects 
In the study JAIP, the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints (multiplicity adjusted) were 
met when comparing the high baricitinib dose to placebo. No endpoints were met for the medium dose 
as compared to placebo. The alpha was unequally spent, favouring the high dose over the medium 
Assessment report

Page 57/110 
 
 
 
dose. Given the numerical results of the medium dose in primary and key secondary outcomes, lying 
roughly between the high dose and placebo treatment effects (see below), it is a posteriori acceptable 
that  the medium dose is not favoured from the efficacy point of view. 
Dose 
While overall, the ‘high dose’ is more effective than the moderate and low doses and placebo, initially 
it is not  clear whether the proposed posology is well justified. The ‘high dose’ in the study was based 
on age: 2 mg for patients <10 years and 4 mg for patients ≥10 years. The proposed posology, 
however, is weight-based and recommends 2 mg QD for patients <30 kg and 4 mg for patients ≥30 
kg. As discussed in the PK section, higher exposure in paediatric patients weighing <30 kg was 
observed and theoretically the probability of developing adverse events could increase. However, 
reducing the dose to 1 mg once daily would lead to too low exposure and could compromise efficacy. 
Therefore, based on the available data the posology paediatric patients with AD weighing <30 kg is 
acceptable. This weight-based posology is in line with the posology for JIA patients assessed in the 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004085/X/0035/G. 
Primary outcome 
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was 42% in the high dose group, as compared 
to 16%  in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The IGA 0 or 1 responses in the high dose group (42%) 
were higher than the responses on the medium dose (26%), while responses were similar in the low 
dose (18%) and placebo (16%) groups. The result for the primary endpoint was supported by the 
planned sensitivity analyses, using several types of censoring and imputation and including the PP-set. 
Over time, from baseline to week 16,  the treatment effects in the high dose group were larger than the 
treatment effects in the medium dose group and the low dose and placebo groups. A difference with 
placebo started to emerge from weeks 2-4, with at week 4 a IGA 0 or 1 response of 23% in the high 
dose group as compared to 5.7% in the placebo group (nominal p<0.05). 
Secondary outcomes 
The result in the primary endpoint is supported by the results of the key secondary outcomes. At week 
16, there was a (multiplicity  adjusted) statistically significant treatment effect of baricitinib high dose, 
as compared to placebo, in EASI75, EASI90, SCORAD75, EASI change from baseline, and Itch NRS ≥4 
points improvement. A statistically significant difference in response in Itch NRS from high dose with 
placebo, occurred at week 4. This is relevant, as itch is the main symptom of AD. Similarly, from 
baseline to week 16, the high  dose had a more favourable course than placebo and the lower two dose 
groups, in EASI75 and 90 and SCORAD75. 
Itch NRS was not assessed in children <10 years of age. Instead, the caregiver assessed PRISM was 
used. In that subgroup, the treatment  effect in PRISM was not statistically significant at week 16 for 
high dose versus placebo (p=0.12), though the mean (SD) treatment effect was numerically larger in 
the high dose group: -0.28 (0.16)  in the high  dose group and 0.02 (0.15) in placebo; the treatment 
effect happened to be -0.44 in the medium dose group. Therefore, the PRISM results support the 
hypothesis that baricitinib  will also be effective on itch in younger patients with AD. 
Of the several other secondary outcomes that were assessed (not multiplicity adjusted), TCS use, 
POEM on patient-assessed symptom severity and IDQOL/CDQOL on the impact on the patient’s daily 
living and the PROMIS on anxiety and depression are deemed most relevant. There was no difference 
in the amount  of low-potency TCS between placebo and baricitinib high dose, but the use of medium-
potency TCS was somewhat lower in the  high dose group (median of 66  gram) as compared to placebo 
(median of 72 gram). Rescue to high dose TCS was also used more in the placebo group (n=10) than 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 58/110 
 
 
 
in the high  dose group (n=4). In the study as well as in clinical practice, it can be expected that TCS is 
stopped not until  skin is clear (IGA 0), thus, the results on TCS use basically follow the expectations.  
Clinical relevance 
The treatment effects of the high dose (adults 4 mg dose equivalent), as compared to placebo, are 
considered clinically relevant. The primary aims of treatment are to reach a clear or almost clear skin, 
and to reduce itch, and these outcomes were reached. At week 16, the proportion of patients with IGA 
0 or 1 was 42% in the high  dose group, as compared to 16% in the placebo group (p<0.0001) in the 
ITT population. The proportion of patients with a response (≥4 points improvement) in itch was 36% in 
the high dose group, as compared to 16% in the placebo group (p<0.05) in the ITT population. 
Already at week 4, the difference in ≥4 points improvement in Itch NRS was (multiplicity adjusted) 
statistically significant  (p=0.0026),  with  7.3% in the  placebo group and 32% in the high dose group. 
There was a relatively small treatment effect in patient-assessed symptom severity (POEM) and no 
effect in patient-assessed impact on daily living (IDQOL/CDQOL) and anxiety and depression 
(PROMIS). Despite this,  the effects on primary and key secondary outcomes on signs (IGA 0 or 1, 
EASI75) and the results on the main symptom itch (Itch response) are deemed sufficiently supportive 
for clinical relevance of the treatment effects.  
Maintenance and discontinuation 
Follow-up  data on the maintenance of efficacy were only available from week 16 up to week 24. At 
week 16 of the placebo-controlled study, there had been 42% (50/120) patients in the high dose 
group with  an IGA 0 or 1, while 68% (81/120) had an IGA 0, 1 or 2 and, according to the protocol, 
remained on their dose in  the extended data set. It is clear that  treatment effects between placebo and 
baricitinib high  dose will diminish if only responders at week 16 are studied. However, in principle, 
these data inform about the maintenance of the effect of prolonged treatment with the proposed high 
dose, in patients with  at least some response (IGA 0, 1 or 2) after 16 weeks of initial treatment. At 
week 16 of the placebo-controlled study, there were 42% (50/120) patients in the high dose group 
with  an IGA 0 or 1, while 68% (81/120) had an IGA 0, 1 or 2 and remained on their dose in the 
extended data set. From the n=81 patients on high  dose who were at least partial responders at week 
16 (cohort 1),  there were 22 patients who lost response and were therefore ‘transitioned’ to high dose 
in the open-label study. Half (11/22)  of these patients regained response before or at week 52. As 
response is not per se static, this is considered supportive for the maintenance of response over 52 
weeks. Among the patients on high dose without a response at week 16 (n=38), few became 
responders by week 24 and only 5 had a response by week 52. This is overall supportive for 
recommending discontinuation of treatment if response has not been reached within 8 weeks 
treatment time. After 8 weeks, the proportion of patients showing >4 points improvement in Itch NRS 
did not increase, although the proportions of patients meeting IGA 0/1 or EASI75 still increased up to 
week 16. The timing of 8 weeks is however similar to adults with AD. Also similar to adults with AD, it 
is recommended in the SmPC that the dose may be reduced by half in patients who attained a durable 
good response. In contrast to adults, for adolescents there are no clinical data on dose tapering. 
However, it is considered that this principle can be extrapolated from adults to adolescents, based on 
similar pathophysiology and the same mode of action of the product, supported by the efficacy results 
of the‘medium dose’ group.  
Subgroups 
The relevance of the predefined subgroups (age, weight, BMI, region, TCNI use and response, TCS use 
and response, systemic treatment, disease severity, atopic conditions) is agreed. For the primary 
endpoint, no statistical  interaction tests (subgroup*treatment)  were statistically significant (p<0.10). 
It therefore appears that the results are robust over relevant subgroups. From the currently presented 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 59/110 
 
 
 
data, it can also be derived that  the dose-response relationship for IGA 0/1 and EASI75 is similar when 
stratified by age (cut-off 10 years) or weight (cut-off 30 kg). The treatment effects (high dose – 
placebo) are largest in the 10 – 18 years and ≥30 kg strata, and smaller but still numerically present in 
the <10  years and <30 kg strata. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the study JAIP, the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints (multiplicity adjusted) were 
met. The high dose of baricitinib appears to be effective for the treatment of moderate-severe AD in 
patients from 2 to <18  years of age, who are candidates for systemic treatment. This includes the 
subgroups of <30 kg receiving 2 mg and ≥30 kg receiving 4 mg, in line with the proposed posology. 
Recommendations to discontinue treatment in case of absence of response, and tapering the dose of 
sustained good response have been included in the SmPC. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the efficacy of baricitinib supports the claimed indication: 
“Olumiant  is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult and paediatric 
patients 2 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy”  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Baricitinib is a selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with lower potency towards inhibition of JAK3 and TYK2 16. 
The proposed indication of this Application is baricitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis in adult  and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older who are candidates for 
systemic therapy.  The proposed posology is 2 mg QD for patients weighing <30 kg and 4 mg QD if 
≥30 kg; the dose should be reduced by half for patients with decreased renal function (creatinine 
clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min) and for patients using strong OAT3 inhibitors (such as 
probenecid). It is proposed that baricitinib may be used with or without topical corticosteroids or 
concomitant topical calcineurin inhibitors.  
Clinical development 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for AD includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (IV-MC-
JAIP; referred to as JAIP). Safety data from the 16-week double-blind treatment period (see the 
section on efficacy) were completed (period 3, last patient, last visit 24 April 2022); safety data from 
patients in  the long-term extension (LTE, period 4) were also provided (data cut-off date 20 June 
2022,  database lock date 22 July 2022). The AD safety database included a total of 466 participants; 
273 patients  (59%) were exposed for at least 52 weeks. From those 273 patients, 229 (84%) were in 
the older age group (10 to < 18 years), and 44 (16%) were in the younger age group (2 < 10 years). 
Safety profile of baricitinib 
According to the warnings in the  SmPC, baricitinib is associated with an increased rate of infections 
(including  upper respiratory tract infections and viral reactivation such as herpes zoster); the 
occurrence of haematological abnormalities (neutropenia, lymphopenia, anaemia); hyperlipidaemia; 
hepatic transaminase elevations; and diverticulitis. There are specific warnings on increased risks for 
malignancy, venous thromboembolism (VTE), MACE, and serious infections (reference is made to the 
JAKi Art 20 referral). A warning is included for AD, stating that combinations with ciclosporin or other 
potent immunosuppressive medicinal products has not been studied and is not recommended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 60/110 
 
 
 
In line with  the above-mentioned warnings, laboratory values should be monitored for lipid 
parameters, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, haemoglobin, and hepatic transaminases. 
Very common Adverse drug reactions  (ADRs) of baricitinib, irrespective of the indication, are upper 
respiratory tract infections and hypercholesterolaemia. Common ADR’s include urinary tract infections, 
herpes infections, pneumoniae, gastroenteritis, and folliculitis), thrombocytosis, headache, nausea, 
abdominal pain, increased ALT (≥  3 x ULN),  rash, acne, CK increase (> 5 x ULN). Uncommon ADRs are 
neutropenia (< 1 x 109 cells/L), swelling of the face, urticaria, hypertriglyceridemia, deep vein 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, diverticulitis, AST increased (≥ 3x ULN), and weight increase.  
In the Risk Management Plan, important identified risks of baricitinib are herpes zoster and VTE. 
Important  potential risks are malignancies, serious infections, myelosuppression, myopathy, drug-
induced liver injury, GI perforation, MACE, and foetal malformation following in utero exposure. Use in 
paediatric patients is included in the safety concerns as missing information.  
Patient exposure 
The safety data originate from a single pivotal, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study of baricitinib in paediatric patients with moderate to severe AD (study 
JAIP).   
The safety population comprised all randomised patients who had had at least 1 dose of baricitinib and 
who did not  discontinue the study due to ‘lost to follow up’ at first postbaseline visit. Three safety 
analyses sets were defined:  
- 
The PC BARI AD Peds analysis set (referred to as the PC BARI set throughout this document) 
includes data from the 16-week placebo-controlled period (period 3) of baricitinib for the low, 
medium, and high dose (and equivalents based on weight; 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg) with 
placebo (Table 16). 
- 
The Ext BARI AD Peds analysis set (Ext BARI set) included data from the PC BARI set and 
data of the LTE period up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (periods 3 and 4). Data 
are censored after transition to open-label baricitinib 4 mg (or high dose equivalent). A total of 
103 PYE was included for placebo versus 99, 104, and 122PYE in the low, medium, and high 
baricitinib dosing groups respectively (Table 17)  
- 
The All BARI AD Peds analysis set (All BARI set) includes all paediatric patients with AD 
exposed to whichever dose of baricitinib during the JAIP study (periods 2 – 5). A total of 751 
PYE from 467patients was included (Table 17); 385patients  (82%) were exposed to baricitinib 
for at least 52 weeks. Of these, 286 (74%) 74were in the older age group (10 to < 18 years), 
and 99(26%)  were in the younger age group. The majority of patients (75%) is still ongoing in 
the JAIP study.

Adverse events 
Summary of adverse events 
Summaries of adverse events are presented in Table 18 and Table 19 and Table 20 below. No deaths 
were observed during the JAIP study.  
SAEs were infrequent in the PC BARI set: n = 5 (4.1%)  in the placebo group and n = 4 (1.1%) for 
the pooled baricitinib groups, with 1  SAE each in the medium and high dose and 2 SAE’s in the low 
dose baricitinib groups. Half of the patients in both the  placebo group and the baricitinib groups had at 
least one TEAE; n = 61 in the placebo group (50%) versus n = 184 (51%) in the pooled baricitinib 
group (50%, 53%,  and 51% for low, medium, and high dose resp.) Study treatment discontinuation 
due to AEs was observed in 2 patients using placebo and 2 patients using baricitinib (1 using low dose, 
1 high dose). 
In the Ext BARI set 9  SAEs were reported in the baricitinib groups (1.7% (IR 2.0), 2.5% (IR 2.9), 
and 3.3% (IR 3.4) for low, medium, and high dose baricitinib) versus 7 SAE’s (5.7%; IR 7.1) in the

placebo group. Rates of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE were also rather comparable between 
the dosing groups (63%, 58%,  and 65% with  corresponding IRs of 148, 135, and 134 resp.). 
Permanent study treatment discontinuation due to AE’s was seen in two additional patients compared 
to the PC BARI set, which makes 4 in total (2 using low, 2 using high dose baricitinib). 
In the All BARI set, the number of SAEs increased (n = 31) and the IR was slightly higher compared 
to the IR in the high  dose baricitinib group observed in the Ext BARI set (IR 4.2 versus 3.4 resp.). 
When stratified by weight (Table 20), SAE’s were more frequent in the <30 kg group (2 mg dose 
according to posology; IR 13.1) compared to the ≥ 30 kg group (4 mg dose according to posology; IR 
6.4).  Patients in the ≥ 30 kg group (4 mg dose according to posology) had a lower IR (122) for at least 
1 TEAE versus the < 30 kg group (IR 185). Discontinuation rates were correspondingly higher in the < 
30 kg group.

Common Adverse Events 
In the PC BARI set,  most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (> 5%) in the high 
dose baricitinib group occurred in the SOCs Infections and infestations (n = 31, 26%), Gastro-
intestinal  disorders (n = 18, 15%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (n = 12, 10%), Nervous 
system disorders (n = 8, 6.7%), and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (n = 6, 5.0%). 
Most  common TEAEs in the high dose baricitinib group by PT were mainly within these SOCs, i.e.: 
-  Abdominal pain (n = 6, 5.0%),   
-  Acne (n = 6, 5.0%),   
-  Headache (n = 6, 5.0%), 
-  Diarrhoea (n = 5, 4.2%),  and 
-  Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (both n = 5, 4.2%).

Numerical imbalances between high dose baricitinib and placebo were found for the SOCs Gastro-
intestinal  disorders (15% for high dose baricitinib versus 11% for placebo), Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (3.3% versus 1.6%), and Investigations (3.3% versus 1.6%). Imbalances in TEAE’s 
by PT were found for: 
-  Abdominal pain (5.0% in high dose baricitinib versus 2.5% in placebo), 
-  Upper respiratory tract infection (4.2% versus 0.8%), 
-  Diarrhoea (4.2% versus 1.6%), 
-  Abdominal pain upper (3.3% versus 0.8%), 
-  Bronchitis (2.5% versus 0.8%), and 
-  Gastroenteritis and Decreased appetite (each 2.5% versus 0%) 
A possible dose response relationship was observed for the PT’s Upper respiratory tract infections and 
Gastro-enteritis; other gastro-intestinal problems including Abdominal pain, Abdominal pain upper, 
Diarrhoea, and Decreased appetite were also more common in medium / high dose compared to low 
dose baricitinib (Table 21).

In the Ext BARI set,  the most common TEAE’s (IR ≥10) in the high dose baricitinib group by SOC 
were much alike those in the PC BARI set, i.e. Infections and infestations (37.5%, IR 62.2), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (15.8%, IR 23.5), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (11.7%, IR 16.7), 
Nervous system disorders (10.8%, IR 15.3), and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(8.3%,  IR 11.5) [NB data not updated after first round]. Most  common TEAE’s (IR ≥ 5) in the high 
dose baricitinib group versus placebo by PT were mainly within these SOCs, i.e.: 
-  COVID-19 (12%,  IR 12.5 versus 4.9%, IR 6.1 in the placebo group),  
-  Headache (10%, IR 10.6 versus 8.1%, IR 9.9),

-  Acne (10%, IR 10.4 versus 4.9%, IR 6.0), 
-  Abdominal pain (6.7%, IR 7.0 versus 3.3%, IR 3.9),  
- 
Influenza (6.0%, IR 5.1 versus 3.3%, IR 4.0). 
-  Nasopharyngitis (5.8%, IR 7.9 9 versus 7.4%, IR 11.9), 
-  Upper respiratory tract infection (5.8%, IR 5.8 versus 3.3%, IR 3.9), and 
-  Diarrhoea (5.0%, IR 5.1 versus 1.6%, IR 1.9). 
Of these, for COVID-19, Abdominal pain, Diarrhoea, and Acne the largest numerical imbalances were 
found between high dose baricitinib versus placebo, as were for Gastro-enteritis (3.4%, IR 3.4 versus 
1.6%,  IR 1.9), Abdominal pain upper (3.3%, IR 3.3 versus 0.8%, IR 1.0), and Rhinitis (3.3%, IR 3.3 
versus 0.8%, IR 1.0). A dose trend was seen for the PT’s Influenza, Cough, Diarrhoea and 
Gastroenteritis (Table 22).  
In the All BARI set, most common TEAE’s (IR ≥10) in the baricitinib high dose group by SOC were 
Infections and infestations (n=284,  61%, IR 64.4), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (n=10, 
23%, IR 16.5),  Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (n=77, 17%, IR 11.2), and 
Gastrointestinal disorders (n=69, 15%, IR 10.2). Most  common AE’s (IR ≥ 5) by PT were: 
-  COVID-19 (19%, IR 12.8) 
-  Nasopharyngitis (14%, IR 9.6), 
-  Acne (11%, IR 7.4), 
-  Headache (9.9%, IR 6.5), and 
-  Upper respiratory tract infection (9.2%, IR 6.0).

Adverse events by maximum severity 
Most  adverse events during the JAIP study were mild to moderate in severity.  
In the PC BARI set 27%  (n = 33)  of the patients in the placebo group versus 31% (n = 112) in the 
pooled baricitinib group had mild TEAE’s. Moderate TEAE’s were reported in 18% (n = 22) versus 19% 
(n = 67)  of the patients respectively; severe TEAE’s were reported in 6 patients allocated to placebo 
(4.9%)  versus 5 patients allocated to baricitinib (1.4%) of whom 1 (0.8%) patient  was from the high 
dose group (Table 18).  
Severe TEAE’s in the baricitinib groups were (by PT) corneal abscess, ligament sprain, ophthalmic 
herpes simplex (high dose baricitinib), vertigo CNS origin (medium dose), bronchospasm, and EBV 
infection (low dose). In the placebo group COVID-19, lice infestation, suicide attempt, and atopic 
dermatitis were reported. Except for Dermatitis atopic in the placebo group (n = 4) no severe TEAE 
occurred more than once.  
The majority of the TEAE’s in the Ext BARI set were mild to moderate in severity (Table 19). Severe 
TEAE’s were most common in the high dose baricitinib group (n = 5, 4.2%, IR 4.3), versus n = 3 
(2.5%,  IR 3.0) in low dose and n = 4 (3.3%, IR 3.9) in medium dose. For placebo, these numbers 
were higher (n = 7, 5.7%, IR 7.0). Additionally reported severe TEAE’s in the Ext BARI set compared 
to the PC BARI set, were single cases of Fibrous cortical defect, Gastro-intestinal bacterial infection, 
and Impetigo in the high dose baricitinib group, single cases of Dysmenorrhoea and Fungal skin 
infection as well as two cases of Asthma in the medium dose group, and  a single event of Blood IgE

increased in the low dose group. Two severe events thus occurred more than once, i.e. Asthma in the 
medium dose baricitinib group, and Dermatitis atopic in the placebo group.  
In the All BARI set, a total of 28 severe TEAE’s were reported (6.0%, IR 3.8), with Food allergy (n = 
3; IR 0.4), and Asthma, Dermatitis  atopic, and Ophthalmic herpes simplex (n = 2 for each PT, IR 0.4). 
Compared to the Ext BARI set, additional  severe TEAE’s were Food allergy (n = 3), Dermatitis atopic (n 
= 2), and single cases of Ophthalmic herpes simplex, Eczema, Eczema impetiginous, Erythrodermic 
atopic dermatitis, Escherichia urinary tract infection, Forearm fracture, Herpes simplex, Interstitial lung 
disease, Meniscus injury, Neurectomy, Neuroma, Postprocedural haemorrhage, Pruritis, and Tonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Deaths  
No deaths  were reported during the JAIP study through the data cut-off date of 20 June 2022. 
Serious adverse events 
In the PC BARI set,  11 SAE’s occurred in 9 patients; 5 patients (4.1%) in the placebo group versus 4 
in baricitinib (2  in low dose baricitinib (1.7%), and 1 each in the moderate and the high dose baricitinib 
groups (0.8%)). The SAE’s in the baricitinib groups were Corneal abscess and ophthalmic herpes 
simplex in 1  patient (high dose), Vertigo of central nervous system (medium dose), and Bronchospasm 
and Dermatitis  atopic (both low dose). In the placebo group Dermatitis atopic (n = 3), and COVID-19, 
Impetigo, Suicide attempt (n = 1 each) occurred.  
For a total of 38 patients,  at least 1 SAE was reported during the JAIP study (All BARI set) 7 in 
placebo and 31 in baricitinib (6.6%, IR 4.2). IR’s increased with increasing dose (IR 2.0, 2.89, and 3.4 
for low, medium, and high dose baricitinib respectively) but these were lower than for placebo (IR 7.1) 
(Ext BARI set).  SAE’s were more incident in the younger age group (IR 5.3) compared to the older 
age group (IR 3.9); reported were Dermatitis atopic (n = 2), Adenoidal hypertrophy, Bronchospasm, 
Erythrodermic atopic dermatitis, E. urinary tract infection, Fungal skin infection, Gastro-intestinal 
bacterial infection, Interstitial lung disease, and Lymphadenitis. 
SAE’s reported in more than 1 patient in the All BARI set, were: 
-  Ophthalmic herpes simplex (n = 2; older age group; both high dose; temporary disruption of 
baricitinib), 
-  Herpes simplex (n = 2; both high dose, older age group; 1 case discontinued baricitinib), 
-  Asthma (n = 2; medium and high dose; older age group, baricitinib continued),  
-  Dermatitis atopic (n = 3; low dose (n = 1, younger age group, baricitinib continued) and high 
dose (n = 2, older age group), in both latter cases baricitinib was discontinued). 
Eleven patients (2.4%) in  the All BARI set experienced at least 1 severe infection (IR 1.5).  
A 15 years old female experienced epilepsy for which hospitalization was required. There was no 
history of seizures. She participated in the double-blind treatment period followed by the LTE at a 
baricitinib medium dose (2 mg/day) and eventually transitioned to a high dose (4 mg/day). On day 
452 she was hospitalized due to juvenile epilepsy (EEG confirmed). Baricitinib was not interrupted, nor 
was the dose changed. The patient recovered. 
Finally, two  SAE’s of angioedema were reported in two patients, resp. 42 and 60 days after termination 
of baricitinib treatment.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI’s) 
AESI’s discussed were infections, hematologic changes, lipid changes, MACE, VTE, ATE, CPK increases 
and muscle-related symptoms, NMSC and malignancy other than NMSC, abnormal hepatic tests, 
effects on renal function, GI perforation, depression and suicidality, allergic reactions and 
hypersensitivity, and photosensitivity reactions.  
Infections  
In the JAIP study, patients were not eligible for participation if they had a history of eczema 
herpeticum in the previous 12 months or 2 previous episodes in general, if they had actual skin 
infections, or if they had recurrent infections including o.a. herpes zoster, hepatitis B or C, TB, typhoid 
infections, or herpes simplex at randomization.   
In the PC BARI set,  infections occurred in 36 patients (30%) in the low dose baricitinib group, 32 
(27%)  in the medium dose group, and 31 patients (26%) in the high  dose group versus 35 (n = 29%) 
in the placebo group. Most common in the high dose group versus placebo were Nasopharyngitis (n = 
5, 4.2%  versus n = 6, 4.9%), Upper respiratory tract infections (n = 5, 4.2% versus n = 1, o.8%), 
bronchitis (n =  3, 2.5% versus n = 1, 0.8%), and COVID-19 (n =  3, 2.5% versus n = 4, 3.3%). One 
patient permanently discontinued the study drug due to infections (low dose, herpes zoster). One 
patient had serious infections in the baricitinib high  dose group (0.8%, IR 2.7; corneal abscess and 
ophthalmic herpes simplex; see narratives above, treatment interrupted but not resumed at time of 
data cut off).  
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 71/110 
 
 
 
 
In the Ext BARI set,  infections occurred in 153 patients in both low (n = 50,  42%, IR 68.2) and 
medium (n = 47, 39%,  IR 63.4) dose baricitinib groups, and 54 patients (45%, IR 60.7)  in high dose 
baricitinib versus 45 (37%, IR 63.3) in the  placebo group. Overall (ALL BARI set) 284 patients had 
infections (61%,  IR 64.4), most common (> 5%) were COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection. Eleven patients (2.4%, IR 1.47) reported at least one serious infection, 
which were Herpes simplex (n =2), Ophthalmic herpes simplex (n = 2), Appendicitis, Ascariasis, 
Corneal abscess, Eczema herpeticum, Eczema imetiginous, Escherichia urinary tract infection, Fungal 
skin infection, Gastrointestinal bacterial infection, Gastrointestinal bacterial overgrowth, and Impetigo 
(n = 1 each; see also section above). Three cases reported 2 or more serious infections, all treated 
with  high dose baricitinib (herpes simplex (n=2) and ophthalmic herpes simplex (n=2)). In 52 (11%) 
cases, antibiotic treatment was required for the treatment of infections. Permanent discontinuation due 
to infection was seen in 5 patients due to herpes zoster (n=2), eczema impetiginous, herpes simplex, 
and respiratory tract infection (n=1 each); temporary discontinuation in 62 patients due to infections 
(IR 8.9).  
Herpes  zoster infections 
In the PC BARI set,  1 case of herpes zoster was reported among patients treated with baricitinib (low 
dose; 0.3%) which was reason for discontinuation, and 1 in the placebo group (0.8%). These were not 
marked as SAE’s and both cases recovered. In the Ext BARI set, 2 additional cases of herpes zoster 
were reported (2 on low dose (1.7%), 1 on high dose baricitinib (0.8%)). Altogether 7 patients in the 
All BARI set (1.5%) reported herpes zoster. None were with ocular, visceral or motor nerve 
involvement. One case concerned a 12-year-old male who was treated with baricitinib high dose who 
developed disseminated herpes zoster infection at day 331 (non-SAE); baricitinib was temporary 
interrupted and resumed without recurrence of infection. The patient fully recovered. No differences 
were observed in the across weight classes. 
Herpes  simplex infections 
Herpes simplex occurred in 7 cases in the pooled baricitinib group (1.9%), among which 3 in the high 
dose group (2.5%) versus 4 in the placebo group (3.3%) (PC BARI set). Another 3 cases occurred in 
the Ext BARI set,  with  a total of 28 (6.0%; IR 3.85)  in the All BARI set Table 24.

Table 24. Summary of Herpes simplex infections 
Tuberculosis  and opportunistic infections 
No cases of tuberculosis were reported in the JAIP study. One participant (0.2%, IR 0.13; high dose) in 
the All BARI AD set had a confirmed opportunistic infection (disseminated herpes zoster, see case 
narrative at section on Herpes zoster). 
Viral  reactivation 
Among those with a detectable Hepatitis B core antibody at baseline and a postbaseline test result (n 
= 4 in the  All BARI set), no reactivation occurred post-baseline.  
MACE and VTE 
No cases of adjudicated MACE, other cardiac events, or VTE occurred.  
Malignancy  and NMSC 
No cases of malignancy or NMSC occurred. 
Physical  growth, skeletal  development, and  fractures 
Physical growth (height, weight,  BMI) was assessed longitudinally throughout the JAIP study and was 
compared with age- and sex-matched peers (CDC 2000). The distribution of the observed percentile 
and Z-score remained consistent over time for the three growth parameters, and the change in 
Assessment report

percentile or Z-score on average remained (close to) 0. In the Ext Bari set, mean (sd) weight 
changes were 3.47 kg (sd 4.6) in placebo (n = 41), 3.91 (sd 5.9) in  low dose baricitinib (n = 44), 2.54 
kg (sd 2.7) in medium dose baricitinib (n = 45), and 4.19  (sd 4.5) in the high  dose baricitinib (n = 
56). Generally, patients remained close to their growth percentile track and Z-score at which they 
entered the study. Overall (All BARI set), n = 61 (13%) of the patients had a treatment-emergent 
event of low weight (IR 8.9). 
Skeletal development was quantified by taking wrist/hand/finger X rays at baseline, week 16, and 
every 6 months thereafter, using the Greulich and Pyle bone age method (1959). Knee X-rays were 
collected for assessment of growth plate closure at the distal femur and the proximal tibia; data 
sampling started after study enrolment due to a regulatory request and was performed every 6 
months. Growth plates were classified as either open, narrowed, partially closed, or closed. 
In the Ext BARI set,  from those who had X-rays of hand/wrist/fingers at baseline, 34 patients in the 
placebo group had X-rays at 52 weeks, versus 36, 37, and 47 in the low, medium, and high dose 
baricitinib groups. Mean differences were -0.14 (sd 1.4) in the placebo group and -0.06 (sd 1.6), 0.19 
(sd 1.3), and -0.08  (sd 1.5) for the baricitinib groups. The majority of patients remained in their 
baseline category or shifted towards normal, i.e. they remained within the boundaries of a mean 
difference between chronological and bone age <2 years (Table 25), although the number of patients 
at long-term follow-up rapidly decreased.  
Table 25. All BARI Population: Percentage of Participants in the Normal Range (Absolute Difference 
between Bone Age and Chronological Age ˂2 Years) at Each Time Point (Hand/Wrist/Finger X-ray) 
Knee X-ray growth plate closure data were presented for both the distal femur and the proximal tibia 
at baseline and weeks 24,  52, 76, and 100;  data for the distal  femur are presented below (Table 26 for 
females and Table 27 for males). The red lines indicate the minimal, mean, and maximum age of 
growth plate closure observed. Please note that these graphs were not yet updated as from the data 
cut off in the initial  application. Results show increasing growth plate closure with progressing age, 
which is to be expected. In females, growth plate closure was observed as early as 12 years of age, 
and in males this was slightly older than 13 years.

Fractures were studied as part of the bone safety and growth monitoring program in the JAIP study.  
In the PC BARI set,  4 fractures were seen in the pooled baricitinib group (1.1%) versus 1 (0.8%) in 
the placebo group. Among these, 1 knee trauma occurred in the low dose group, and 2 radius 
fractures and 1 hand fracture occurred in the high dose group. All fractures were associated with 
trauma, and they all recovered. In the Ext BARI set, 4 fractures were reported in the low dose 
baricitinib group (3.3%,  IR 4.1; 1 radius fracture, epiphyseal fracture, foot fracture, and joint injury) 
and 3 in the high  dose baricitinib group (2.5%, IR 2.5; one hand fracture and two radius fractures). All 
fractures recovered.  
Considering all patients treated with baricitinib  (All BARI set), 16 fractures were reported (3.4%, IR 
2.1).  An additional number of 3 hand fractures, 1 radius fracture, 1 wrist fracture, 1 ankle fracture, 1 
foot fracture, and 2 forearm fractures) was seen (Table 28). All bone fractures were trauma-related 
and recovered; 15/18 fractures occurred in patients in the older age group.

Allergic  reactions  and hypersensitivity 
A larger proportion of patients in the placebo group (n = 9, 7.4%) compared to the low, medium, and 
high dose baricitinib groups (n = 4, 3.3%;  n = 6, 5.0%;  and n = 4, 3.3% resp.) reported AE’s related 
to allergic reactions and hypersensitivity (narrow) (n = 9, 7.4% versus n = 4, 3.3%) in the PC BARI 
set. 
In the Ext BARI set,  no dose response relation was observed.  
Overall, 58 patients (12.4%, IR 8.27)  in the All BARI set had at least 1 TEAE (narrow search). 
Angioedema (narrow) was found for 13 (2.8%, IR 1.75) patients, and PT’s were Urticaria (n = 9), 
Angioedema (n = 2), Eyelid oedema, Face oedema, and Urticaria cholinergic (n = 1 for each). 
Two anaphylactic reactions occurred in the JAIP study (All BARI set; 0.4%) which were both ascribed 
to known allergies. One case had an allergic reaction to food, at day 296 after starting baricitinib. The 
other patient had anaphylaxis that required treatment in the ER, due to underlying baseline allergies; 
study drug was not changed.

Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL  cholesterol, and triglycerides were investigated during the JAIP 
study.  
A dose-dependent increased frequency in shifting towards ‘(borderline) high’ was observed for both 
total cholesterol and LDL  cholesterol in the PC BARI set (Table 29) and the Ext BARI set. A total  of 
8.8% (n  = 37) of the patients in  the All BARI set had total cholesterol that increased to high, and 
20% (n  = 75) of the patients had an LDL  that  increased to borderline or high. Increased triglycerides 
and decreased HDL were more common in placebo compared to the baricitinib groups in the Ext BARI 
set.  
Similar proportions of hyperlipidemia-related TEAE’s (PT: blood cholesterol increased and 
hypertriglyceridemia) were reported in the pooled baricitinib group (n = 3, 0.8%), baricitinib high dose 
group (n = 1, 0.8%),  and the placebo group (n = 1, 0.8%) of the PC BARI set.  A total of 7 patients 
(1.5%)  reported 1 or more hyperlipidemia-related AE’s (PT hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, blood cholesterol increased, and blood triglycerides increased).

Haematology 
Neutrophils 
Decreased neutrophil counts were more often observed in the baricitinib-treated patients compared to 
patients on placebo in the PC BARI set (201%  in pooled baricitinib group versus 16% in placebo); of 
these, two were grade 3 (both in baricitinib high dose (1.7%) and placebo group (1.6%)) and three 
were grade 3 or higher in the low dose baricitinib group (0.8%). None were Grade 4. Among those 
with  decreased neutrophil counts Grade 2 or higher, one patient had an infection (high dose baricitinib, 
14%; bronchitis)  versus 2 in the placebo group (33%; rhinitis, tonsillitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection).  
In the Ext BARI set,  Grade 3 decreased neutrophils were found in 8 patients using baricitinib (2 
(1.7%)  in the low, 2 (1.7%)  in the medium, and 4 (3.3%)  in the high  dose group), pointing to a higher 
risk for decreased neutrophils in the highest baricitinib dose. No decreased neutrophil counts grade 4 
were observed in any of the groups. Overall, (All BARI set) grade 3 decreased neutrophil counts were 
seen in 14 patients (3.0%).  No grade 4 decreases were reported.

Lymphocytes 
Decreased lymphocyte counts were less often observed in the baricitinib groups compared to the 
placebo group (5.0% in pooled baricitinib versus 7.4% in placebo), and most were Grade 1 or 2 in the 
PC BARI set.  None were Grade 4. Grade 3 was seen in 1 patient on high dose baricitinib (0.8%) and 1 
patient in  the placebo group (0.8%). A relation between decreased lymphocytes (Grade 2 or higher) 
and infections could not been found due to small numbers (1 in high dose baricitinib, nasopharyngitis; 
and 1 in placebo, tonsillitis).   
In the Ext BARI set,  decreased lymphocyte counts grade 3 was found in 1 patient using baricitinib 
(0.8%,  high dose group); the relation between baricitinib treatment and decreased lymphocyte counts 
could not be verified.  
In the All BARI set, 2 patients (0.4%,  IR 0.27) had Grade 3. Only 2 of the patients with decreased 
lymphocytes Grade 2 or higher had infections (influenza and nasopharyngitis).  
Hemoglobin 
In the PC BARI set,  Hb decreases were seen in 11.5% (n=14) in the placebo group versus 12.5% 
(n=15),  13.4%  (n=16), and 15.8%  (n=19)  in the baricitinib low, medium and high dose groups. In the 
baricitinib groups, all concerned Hb decreases were classified as Grade 1, and none as Grade 2 or 
higher.  
In the Ext BARI set,  no abnormal values ≥ Grade 2 were observed for haemoglobin. 
In the All BARI set, 1 patient (0.2%)  using baricitinib showed a decrease in Hb classified as CTCAE 
Grade 2.  No abnormal values ≥ Grade 2 were observed. 
Platelets 
Assessment report

Page 78/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increased platelet numbers were observed in 2 patients (1.7%) in the low dose baricitinib group (PC 
BARI set),  1 patient (0.8%)  in the high dose baricitinib group (0.8%),  and 1 (0.8%) in the  placebo 
group. These all concerned Grade 1. Thrombocytes ≤ 600 billions/L to > 6000 billions/L in the Ext 
BARI group was found in 1 patient in the placebo group (0.8%), and 3 in each dose baricitinib group 
(2.5%  each); 18 cases were observed altogether in the All BARI set (3.9%).  
Liver  enzymes 
In the PC BARI set,  no ALT or AST ≥ 3 ULN was found in any of the baricitinib-treated patients, 
compared to 2 (ALT) in the placebo group. TBL was increased ≥ 2 ULN in 1 patient on low dose 
baricitinib and 1 on placebo without  other liver enzyme increases, and a direct bilirubin < 30%. 
Increased ALP values were more frequent in placebo than in (pooled) baricitinib (3.3% versus 2.2%), 
corresponding physiological growth.  
No dose-response could be observed in the Ext BARI set. In the All BARI set, 6 patients (1.3%) had 
AST levels ≥ 3 ULN, 2 (0.4%) had AST ≥ 5 ULN,  and 1 (0.2%) ≥ 10  ULN,  each with normal total 
bilirubin. Two patients  (0.4%) had ALT levels ≥ 3 ULN; no higher levels were observed and no patient 
had concomitant complaints. Serum bilirubin was increased ≥ 2 ULN in 7 patients (1.5%)  which is 
likely due to Gilbert syndrome; no higher levels were observed. Increased ALP values ≥ 1.5 ULN were 
found in 28patients  (6.0%),  and ≥ 2 ULN  in 8 patients (1.7%),  which is most likely related to normal 
physiological bone growth.  
Other  laboratory  findings 
Creatine  phosphokinase changes  and muscle related  symptoms 
Increased CK values were more frequent for baricitinib-treated patients in the PC BARI set (n = 68, 
18.9%  for the pooled baricitinib group) compared to those in the placebo group (n = 19, 15.6%). Most 
had CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 was found for placebo (n = 1, 0.8%) and 2 in baricitinib (1 in low 
and 1 in medium dose; both 0.8%). TEAE’s myalgia were reported by 2 patients (1 in placebo and 1 in 
baricitinib low dose; 0.8% each).  
In the Ext BARI set,  3 patients in the placebo group (2.5%) versus 5 (4.2%), 2 (1.7%),  and 2 
(1.7%)  patients in the low,  medium and high dose baricitinib groups had increased CK values Grade 3. 
Grade 4 increases were seen in 2 (1.6%), 2 (1.7%), 0, and 1 (0.8%) of the patients respectively. In 
the All BARI set 179 patients  (38.7%) had any Grade of increased CK, with 20 patients having Grade 
3 (4.3%),  and 9 (1.9%) Grade 4.  
In the majority of cases, increased CK was ascribed to physical exercise or athletic activity by the 
investigator; a CTCAE Grade 2 or higher was not associated with AEs of muscle injury (myalgia).  
Serum  glucose 
In the PCBARI set,  the percentages of patients with the TEAE low fasting serum glucose was higher 
for the patients treated with  baricitinib versus those in the placebo group. Mean changes during the 
placebo-controlled period were rather small (between -0.01 and + 0.19 for the placebo and the 
baricitinib groups), without  a dose-response relation.  
In the Ext BARI set,  2 (1.6%, IR 2.0) patients  had low fasting serum glucose, versus 7 (5.8%, IT 
7.2),  9 (7.5%, IR 9.6), and 5 (4.2%,  IR 4.2) in the low,  medium, and high dose baricitinib groups. In 
the All BARI set 35 patients reported low fasting serum glucose 7.5%, IR 4.9). The majority of cases 
had only one episode reported of low fasting serum glucose and there were no adverse events 
reported associated with hypoglycaemia. Seven episodes of serum fasting glucose < 3.0 were 
reported, with the lowest value of 1.11 mmol/L in two  separate patients.

Safety in special populations 
The impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the occurrence of common TEAE’s (defined as occurring 
≥ 2% in  the participants in the PC BARI set) was evaluated to identify possible subgroups of patients 
on baricitinib with  different AE profiles compared to other subgroups.  
The TEAE’s assessed were acne, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, bronchitis, COVID-19, 
decreased appetite, diarrhoea, gastro-enteritis, headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract 
infection.  
Intrinsic factors were defined as baseline renal function, age (young versus older age group), gender 
(female, male), baseline BMI (<18.5 kg/m2 [underweight], ≥18 - <25 kg/m2 [normal weight], ≥25  to 
<30 kg/m2 [overweight] and ≥30 [obese], and race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black 
or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders, White, and multi-racial). Extrinsic 
factors were defined as region of the world (Europe, Japan and the rest of the world), and prior 
systemic therapy for AD (yes versus no).  
Gender 
Out of 466  participants in the All BARI set 50.4% were female, and 49.6% were male. TEAE’s were 
more common in females (n=172, 73.2%, IR 154.3) versus males (n=154, 66.7%, IR 126.1). TEAE’s 
reported at higher IR in females versus males, were (by SOC): 
• 
• 
• 
Immune system disorders (n=12, 5.1%, IR 4.5 versus n=5, 2.2%, IR 1.9), 
Reproductive system and breast disorders (n=14, 6.0%, IR 5.3 versus n=2, 0.9%, IR 0.8), 
mostly driven by Dysmenorrhoea (IR 2.2 versus 0), and 
Surgical and medical procedures (n=7, 3.0%, IR 2.6 versus n=2, 0.9%, IR 0.8. 
No clear differences in IR’s for TEAE’s by SOC were reported in males versus females. 
Age  
At baseline, 133 patients (28.5%)  were aged 2 to <10 years, and 333 (71.5%) were 10 to < 18 years.  
TEAE’s with ≥  2% of patients in the high  dose baricitinib group in the PC BARI set were assessed for 
differences with regard to age categories. In the PC BARI set, the proportion of younger patients 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE in the pooled baricitinib group (15.3%, n = 55) was almost half the 
proportion of the older age group (35.8%, n = 129), and this was also true for the placebo group 
(17.2%,  n = 21) in  younger age group versus 32.8% (n=40) in older age group). 
In the All BARI set, TEAE’s were more common in the younger age group (n = 108, 81%, IR 161) 
than in  the older age group (n = 254, 76%, IR 115), and this was also observed for SAE’s (6.7%, IR 
5.3 versus 6.6%, IR 3.9 resp.) and AE’s leading to discontinuation of study drug (3.7%, IR 2.9 versus 
2.4%,  IR 1.4 resp.). Most TEAE’s were mild/moderate in both groups (Table 18 and Table 19).  
TEAE’s more common in younger versus older age groups in the All BARI set, were (by SOC / SMQ): 
-  Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (n=24, 18%, IR 24.0 in younger age group 
versus n=33, 9.9%, IR 8.3 in older age group), mostly drive by Cough (IR 6.3 versus IR 0.9), 
Bronchospasm (IR 3.6 versus IR 0.2), and Oropharyngeal pain (IR 3.6 versus IR 0.5). 
TEAE’s more common in older versus younger age groups in the All BARI set, were (by SOC / SMQ): 
-  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (n=73, 22%, IR 20.5 versus n=11, 8.3%, IR 10.3), 
mostly driven by Acne (IR 10.1 versus IR 1.8).

Weight 
Out of 466  participants in the All BARI set 102 (22%)  were < 30 kg, and 364 (78%) were ≥ 30 kg. 
TEAE’s had a higher IR in the <30 kg subgroup (69%, IR 161.7) than in the ≥ 30  kg subgroup (70%, 
IR 134.5). TEAE’s reported at higher IR in <30 kg versus ≥ 30 kg group, were (by SOC): 
• 
• 
Immune system disorders (n=5, 4.9%, IR 5.8 versus n=12, 3.3%, IR 2.7, respectively), 
mostly driven by Food allergy (IR 2.3 versus IR 0.9), and 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (n=20, 19.6%, IR 26.4 versus n=37, 10.2%, 
IR 8.8), mostly driven by Cough (IR 7.0 versus IR 1.1), Bronchospasm (IR 3.4 versus IR 0.4), 
and Oropharyngeal pain (IR 3.5 versus IR 0.7). 
TEAE’s reported at higher IR in ≥ 30 kg versus <30 kg group, were (by SOC): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (n=33, 9.1%, IR 7.8 versus n=3, 2.9%, IR 3.5) 
Nervous system disorders (n=52, 14.3%, IR 13.0 versus n=5, 4.9%, IR 5.8), mostly driven by 
Headache (IR 8.9 versus IR 4.6), 
Psychiatric disorders (n=11, 3.0%, IR 2.5 versus n=0), and 
Surgical and medical procedures (n=9, 2.4%, IR 2.0 versus n=0). 
The safety data in the weight group below 30 kg was also presented by weight class with a cut-off of 
20 kg (Table 31). The safety in these two subgroups will also be followed post-marketing. In the 
subgroup of 10 to <20 kg, there were less patients with at least 1 TEAE but these were more 
frequently of moderate severity. SAEs were infrequent in both groups and overall not considered 
related to treatment, except for one case of corneal abscess and ophthalmic herpes simplex in a 
patient weighing  20 to <30  kg (also presented in the SAE section and the infection section). There was 
no apparent difference in the occurrence of infections between the two groups, except for the number 
of patients with  skin infections requiring antibiotic treatment. None of the skin infections requiring 
antibiotic  treatment in patients weighing  10 to less than 20 kg was severe, serious, or led to 
discontinuation  of study treatment.

Out of 466  participants in the All BARI set, 241 patients (51.7%)  had a BMI <20 kg/m2, 206  patients 
(44.2%)  had a BMI >20 to <30 kg/m2, and 18 patients  (3.9%) had a BMI >30 kg/m2. The IR of 
TEAE’s was 135.5, 141.9,  and 156.1 respectively. No SOCs were clearly reported more often in one of 
the three groups.  
Race 
In the All BARI set, 346 patients (74.2%)  were of White race, 85 (18.2%) Asian, 12 (2.6%)  Black or 
African American, and 8 patients (1.7%) were of American Indian or Alaska Native race. One patient 
was reported multi-racial, and for 14 patients (3.0%) no race was reported. Excluding the latter two 
groups, the IR of TEAE’s was highest for Black or African American (n=8, 66.7%, IR 169.5), White 
(n=243,  70.2%,  IR: 138.2), and Asian patients (n=59,  69.4%, IR 136.0).  Comparison of the two 
largest groups (White race and Asian race), TEAE’s with a higher IR in the White versus the Asian

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled period (PC BARI set), 4 patients (2 in placebo, 1 in low dose and 1 in high 
dose baricitinib) permanently discontinued from study treatment. In the baricitinib group, these AE’s 
were: Herpes zoster (baricitinib low dose, 9 years of age, resolved upon discontinuation), and Lichen 
planus (baricitinib high  dose, 8 years of age, ongoing at discontinuation). Study treatment was 
temporarily discontinued more often in placebo compared to the baricitinib group. In the placebo 
group, 16 patients temporarily discontinued treatment (13%)  versus 22 (6.1%) in the pooled 
baricitinib groups. In all but 5 patients,  the interruption was due to an AE (mainly SOC Infections and 
infestations); other reasons were abnormal lab results and the investigator's decision.  
In the Ext BARI set,  one additional patient permanently discontinued the study drug (PT Myalgia) in 
the low dose baricitinib group. Study treatment was temporarily discontinued in 14 (11.7%) in the  low 
dose group, 10 (8.3%) in the medium dose group, and 16 (13.3%) patients  in the high dose group. 
Most  common reasons were AE’s in SOC Infections and infestations, with an IR of 11.8 in low dose, IR 
6.5 in  medium dose, and IR 11.5 in high dose baricitinib (Table 32).  
In the ALL BARI set, an additional number of 7 patients treated with  baricitinib (total  number of 10; 
IR 1.9) permanently discontinued study drug due to AE’s, which by PT were Dermatitis atopic (n = 2), 
Headache (n = 2), and Urticaria, Herpes Zoster, and Respiratory tract infection (n = 1 each). Study 
treatment was temporarily discontinued in 93 (20%, mean duration 10.3 days), 81% of the due to 
AE’s in the SOC Infections and infestations (n = 49, IR 9.7).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of baricitinib is quite well established, mainly based on data from adults with RA. 
Recently a comparable safety profile with RA was observed in adults with AA or AD.  
The Art 20 JAK referral  imposed stricter warning text (SmPC section 4.4) for serious infection, MACE, 
VTE, and malignancy including NMSC for baricitinib. The posology is being adjusted, in that for adult 
patients with  risk factors for MACE, VTE, and malignancy the 2 mg dose is recommended over the 4 
mg dose (irrespective of the indication). No such specific statements are included for the paediatric 
population. This can be agreed because MACE, VTE, and malignancy a priori are rare in children and no 
such events occurred in the JAIP study. Furthermore, this is in line with the SmPC for Rinvoq 
(paediatric population with  AD) and the procedure for JIA (EMA/H/C/004085/X/0035/G). An additional 
warning to point  to the class effects of oral JAK inhibitors covered by the Art. 20 referral is considered 
not required, because paediatric patients do not tend to accumulate risk factors for MACE, VTE, 
malignancies and NMSC, and existing warnings, e.g., for serious infections, NMSC, etc. already apply. 
Clinical studies and exposure 
Safety data of baricitinib in paediatric patients with AD originate from one pivotal phase III study 
(JAIP) including 467 patients.  At time of data cut-off, 751 PYE were available, with 385 patients 
exposed for over 52 weeks. From these patients, 286 were older aged (10 to <18 years) and 99 were 
younger aged (2 to <10 years) children. After completion of the JAIP study, in December 2026, long-
term safety data in the youngest age group will be available for a maximum of 133 patients, which is 
considered sufficient. However, rather than age-based, the population stratification based on body 
weight  is considered more relevant, as this corresponds to the proposed posology using a cut-off body 
weight  of 30 kg. Since the exposure in paediatric patients weighing 10 to <20 kg is higher compared 
to adults with  the proposed posology, the probability of developing adverse events could increase. 
Therefore, the MAH committed to follow safety in these weight groups, especially also in the children 
weighing 10  to <20 kg (see PK section).  
Three safety databases were defined from the JAIP study. The PC BARI set enables placebo-
controlled comparison of the safety of baricitinib during 16 weeks of treatment, including the effect of 
dose. The Ext BARI set adds long-term dose related safety data from the LTE study, but 
interpretation is complicated because only patients with at least some response (IGA 0, 1, or 2) 
proceed with their allocated dose or placebo in the LTE and due to the selective drop-out it does not 
totally represent a placebo-controlled study period. The All BARI set includes significantly more PYE 
(total  PYE 751) including exposure >1 year on baricitinib. 
Permanent discontinuation and temporary discontinuation of baricitinib during the JAIP study were 
infrequent in the PC and Ext BARI sets, but up to 20% in the All BARI set. AE’s were the most common 
reasons for discontinuation, mainly Infections and infestations. There was no difference with placebo. 
Overall, 10 patients (IR 1.9) using baricitinib permanently discontinued, and 93 patients (20%) 
temporarily discontinued. Mean duration of interruption was longest in the high dose baricitinib group, 
but  still comparable to the placebo group. 
Overview  of adverse events 
No deaths  were reported during the JAIP study.  
Overall, the most common TEAE’s for baricitinib in paediatric patients with moderate to severe AD 
were generally in line with the known ADR’s for baricitinib. In the placebo-controlled period, TEAE’s by 
SOC  that occurred more frequently in high dose baricitinib compared to placebo, were Gastro-
intestinal  disorders (15% for high dose baricitinib versus 11% for placebo), Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (3.3% versus 1.6%), and Investigations (3.3% versus 1.6%). TEAE’s by PT that 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 85/110 
 
 
 
occurred more frequently in high dose baricitinib compared to placebo were Abdominal pain (5.0% 
versus 2.5%), Upper respiratory tract infections (4.2% versus 0.8%), Diarrhoea (4.2% versus 1.6%), 
Abdominal pain upper (3.3% versus 0.8%), Bronchitis (2.5% versus 0.8%), and Gastro-enteritis and 
Decreased appetite (each 2.5% versus 0%). Abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infections, 
diarrhoea, and gastro-enteritis are acknowledged ADR’s for baricitinib; no additional safety measures 
are considered required. 
Considering all data from the JAIP study, dose response relations were observed for Upper 
respiratory tract infections (including Influenza and Cough), and Gastro-enteritis / gastro-intestinal 
symptoms (Abdominal pain, Abdominal pain upper, Diarrhoea, and Decreased appetite).  
TEAE’s generally were mild to moderate in severity; severe TEAE’s were more frequent in placebo 
group than in the pooled baricitinib group during the double-blind period. Altogether, 28 severe TEAE’s 
were reported during baricitinib use in the JAIP study so far. Food allergy was reported three times, 
Dermatitis  atopic and Ophthalmic herpes simplex were reported twice; the other TEAE’s were reported 
just once. Among the severe TEAE’s there were 10 infections, i.e. Ophthalmic herpes simplex infection 
(n = 2),  Corneal abscess, Fungal skin infection, Herpes simplex, Impetigo, Eczema impetiginous, EBV 
infection, urinary tract infection with  E. coli, and Gastrointestinal bacterial infection (all n = 1). 
Tonsillar hypertrophy might also be the result of an infection. The remaining severe TEAE’s were 
generally not considered associated with baricitinib, but with atopic dermatitis or atopic constitution 
more generally.  
Serious adverse events 
Rates of SAE’s were low, but highest in the high dose baricitinib group and the placebo group. In the 
Ext BARI set, IR’s increased with increased dosing (IR 2.0, 2.89, and 3.4 for low, medium, and high 
baricitinib dose). Considering all patients who received at least one dose baricitinib (All BARI set), 31 
SAE’s were reported, with Ophthalmic herpes simplex, Herpes simplex, Asthma, and Dermatitis atopic 
reported more than once. The Herpes cases were all in the high dose, older age group, except for one 
case of ophthalmic herpes (SAE) in a patient weighing 20 – 30 kg. Not all SAE’s were associated with 
baricitinib use (see also above), including events of angio-edema which occurred > 30 days after 
treatment termination. 
One SAE of juvenile epilepsy (EEG confirmed) was reported in a patient using high dose baricitinib (4 
mg QD).  Considering the entire baricitinib database as presented by the MAH, thus including also data 
from RA, AD, AA, and JIA, an association with baricitinib treatment was considered unlikely mainly 
because of: a) relevant comorbidity such as (fatal) sepsis which may evoke seizures, b) long-term use 
of baricitinib before first event, c) occurrence of a single event despite treatment continuation, d) 
occurrence of an epileptic event / seizure > 2 weeks after treatment termination, and / or e) the 
limited amount of BBB crossing (1-2%).  
Adverse events of special interest 
Infections are included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC; serious infections are an important 
potential risk for baricitinib (see also section on SAE’s above). Current data align with findings in other 
indications, in that  infections are mainly mild to moderate and predominantly comprise 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, and COVID. Although increasing rates 
with  increasing baricitinib doses were seen, still higher rates were seen in the placebo group than in 
the high dose baricitinib group. Herpes zoster and herpes simplex occurred in a few patients, and one 
had a disseminated herpes zoster infection classified as opportunistic (but not an SAE). This patient 
fully recovered. Eleven patients (2.4%) experienced at least 1 severe infection. Tuberculosis did not 
emerge. Thus, the current text in the SmPC on infections is considered adequate and does not require 
rephrasing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 86/110 
 
 
 
No additional safety measures are considered necessary on (serious) infections in the SmPC, because: 
1) infections (including  herpes zoster) are already listed as ADR for baricitinib, 2) serious infections are 
listed as important potential risk in the RMP, 3)  section 4.4 already  includes warnings in case of 
infections prior to start of baricitinib as well as during use of baricitinib, and finally 4) stricter warning 
texts have already been included on serious infections in section 4.4 of the SmPC and also dose 
recommendations were included based for those at risk for e.g. serious infections based on the JAKi 
article 20 referral.  
MACE, VTE  (both important  identified risks of baricitinib), and Malignancies  and NMSC  (important 
potential risks) were not observed in the paediatric AD population. Although these safety issues might 
hypothetically emerge in the paediatric population the risks are considered nil; the texts in the current 
SmPC are considered adequate.  
Non-clinical data from baricitinib in juvenile rat studies have given rise to concerns on physical 
growth, skeletal  development,  and fractures  (EU Risk management plan version 17.1; VV-PVG-
098605);  adverse effects were observed at doses 0.6- to 10-fold the exposure in humans at 4 mg/day. 
Upon request the MAH  provided more detailed data on this  issue. Physical growth parameters indicated 
that  patients generally remained close to their growth percentile and Z-score, which is reassuring. 
Data  on skeletal development was illustrated by X-rays; data were available for a subset of patients 
only. The MAH  provided a comparison with  medical literature for reference and generally the data from 
the JAIP study corresponded to this. The lowest reported age of growth plate closure in the JAIP study 
was younger than in the general population (12 years for the female population and slightly older than 
13 years for the male population. However, the few instances of early growth plate disclosure usually 
were related to advanced bone age at baseline. A total of 16 fractures was reported in the All BARI 
set; all were trauma related and recovered. The majority was in the upper extremity, which 
corresponds to fracture patterns in general. There was no clear dose response. Fractures were more 
frequent in the older age group, which can be understood given the main cause of the fractures (i.e. 
trauma / sports). The reported IR for fractures in the JAIP study does not exceed the IR in the general 
population. Follow-up  is however too short to draw firm conclusions, and due to the effects on bone 
metabolism detected in non-clinical data, ‘impaired growth and skeletal development in children >2 
years of age and adolescents’ is added as important potential risk to the safety specification of the 
RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Raised blood lipids, notably high LDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia are acknowledged ADR’s for 
baricitinib, and it  is recommended to monitor lipid values during treatment (SmPC section 4.4). Higher 
levels of total cholesterol and LDL  cholesterol were indeed observed in the JAIP study for those treated 
with  baricitinib versus placebo, with an evident dose dependency. Because hyperlipidemia is (much) 
less common in the general paediatric population, it is now explicitly mentioned in the SmPC that lipid 
levels should be monitored and treated according to international clinical guidelines in ‘paediatric and 
adult patients  treated with baricitinib’.    
Baricitinib is known to affect haematologic  parameters;  Thrombocytosis > 600 x 109 cells/L and 
neutropenia < 1 x 109 cells/L are ADR’s included in section 4.8 and lymphopenia and decreased 
haemoglobin are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of baricitinib. In the placebo-controlled period, 
decreased neutrophil counts grade 2 and 3 were more common in baricitinib treated patients (21%) 
compared to placebo (16%), and the highest rates were in the high dose baricitinib group. No events 
with  Grade 4 occurred during the entire JAIP study. A relation between neutropenia and serious 
infections was not demonstrated. Thrombocytosis was seen in a small number of patients and were all 
(except 1 Grade 2) Grade 1. It is already currently stated in the SmPC (section 4.8) that 
thrombocytosis is uncommon in AD trials. Lymphopenia was also uncommon, with higher rates in 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 87/110 
 
 
 
placebo compared to baricitinib, and were predominantly Grade 1-2, except for 2 cases Grade 3. 
Decreased haemoglobin was slightly more common in baricitinib compared to placebo, but were all 
(except 1 Grade 2) Grade 1 and thus considered not clinically relevant. For both lymphopaenia and 
decreased haemoglobin, no changes are considered required in the SmPC. 
Abnormal liver  enzymes are associated with baricitinib use in adults; ALT and AST ≥ 3 ULN are 
recognized ADR’s (common and uncommon resp.) included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of baricitinib. In 
the JAIP study, abnormal liver enzymes were rare: 2 patients had an ALT elevation ≥ 3 ULN without 
clinical symptoms and with  a spontaneous decrease after 2 weeks, two patients had increased AST ≥ 5 
ULN  with  normalization within 2 weeks after interruption of baricitinib, and 1 patient had AST ≥ 10 
ULN.  In the current SmPC (section 4.8) it is reported that increased ALT ≥ 3 ULN is uncommon in AD, 
but  for AST such a statement is not included.  
Increased CK (≥ 5 ULN)  is a recognized ADR included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of baricitinib. In the 
All BARI set, 38% of the patients had Grade 1 or 2 CK elevations and 1.9%  (n = 9) and 1.3% (n = 6) 
of the patients had Grade 3 and 4 resp. (indicating CK values ≥ 5 ULN), without a dose relation. 
Increased CK values were mainly ascribed to physical exercise. No changes to the SmPC are 
considered required. 
Overall, 35 patients reported low fasting serum glucose (7.5%, IR 4.9; All BARI set). Absolute values 
presented by the MAH upon request, revealed 2 cases with incidental serum glucose of 1.11 mmol/L.  
Subgroups 
Subgroup comparisons were performed for TEAE’s that were most common (≥ 2%) in the high dose 
baricitinib group (PC BARI set); strata were defined by in- and extrinsic factors that might affect safety 
profiles. The MAH additionally provided stratification analyses based on the All ARI set. 
Younger  patients (2  to < 10 years) were more susceptible to TEAE’s (IR 175) than the older age 
group (10 to < 18  years; IR 129), especially for the SOC SOCs Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders (IR 24 versus IR 8.3, mainly driven by Cough, Bronchospasm, and Oropharyngeal pain). 
Considering that the increased risk in the low weight patient population is valid, the findings may be 
ascribed to immaturity of the immune system in younger patients compared to adults, and atopic 
reactions triggered by viral infections which are more common in younger children. Older patients 
reported psychiatric disorders (e.g., suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) while this was not observed 
in the youngest age group. Also Skin and subcutaneous disorders and nervous system disorders 
(headache in particular) were more prevalent. These findings are not surprising; AD itself is associated 
with  psychiatric disorders, and the impact emerges especially during (early) puberty when self-
awareness increases. With regard to headache, it is known that younger children are less capable than 
older children to ascribe physical symptoms to a specific body region.  
Stratification by weight was additionally provided by the MAH. This was essential because the 
proposed posology is based on weight. IR’s were higher in the lower weight group (< 30 kg) compared 
to the higher weight  group (≥ 30 kg) (IR 162 versus 134), which corresponds to the increased IR’s in 
younger age compared to older age (see section above). The safety in the subgroups of 10 to <20 kg 
and 20 to <30  kg will be followed post-marketing, as study JAIP was added as a Category 3 Study of 
the RMP. 
The observed differences in IR’s for the strata race, region of world, and prior systemic treatment 
status were not discussed by the applicant. With regard to prior systemic treatment status, most 
differences in IR were due to events that are common in patients with an atopic constitution (such as 
allergy, allergic conjunctivitis) and/or the paediatric population in general (lymphadenopathy). 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 88/110 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the differences in IR’s are mainly driven by small numbers. This issue is not further 
pursued. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available data, baricitinib in the  proposed doses is considered acceptable in the paediatric 
population of patients with  AD, and the safety profile appears to be in line with what is already known 
from other indications  and in  adults. The possibility of increased adverse events due to the exposure in 
paediatric patients weighing 10 to  <20 kg being higher when compared to exposure in adults, will be 
monitored post-authorisation in a Category 3 study and through routine monitoring by the MAH. From 
non-clinical data a risk regarding bone safety, skeletal development, and growth was identified and 
added to  the RMP as missing information. The available data from Study JAIP do not  suggest an overall 
effect of baricitinib treatment on skeletal maturation in paediatric patients. More clinical data in 
paediatric patients will be collected over a longer follow-up time as the study JAIP was been included 
as a Category 3 study of the RMP.

Risk Minimisation Measures 
SmPC Section 4.4 advises that in 
patients with  cardiovascular or 
malignancy risk factors, baricitinib 
should only be used if no suitable 
treatment alternatives are 
available. In patients with known 
VTE risk factors other than 
cardiovascular or malignancy risk 
factors, baricitinib should be used 
with  caution. VTE risk factors other 
than cardiovascular or malignancy 
risk factors include previous VTE, 
patients undergoing major surgery, 
immobilisation, use of combined 
hormonal contraceptives or 
hormone replacement therapy, and 
inherited coagulation disorder. 
If clinical features of VTE occur, 
treatment should be discontinued 
and patients should be evaluated 
promptly and appropriately 
treated.  
PL Section 2 advises patients: 
• 
To talk to their doctor or 
pharmacist before and during 
treatment if they have 
previously had a VTE or if they 
develop symptoms of VTE 
•  Olumiant should be used with 
caution in patients  with risk 
factors for VTE  
That treatment should be 
discontinued if clinical symptoms of 
VTE occur.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1,  5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation on the package leaflet with target patient 
groups has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reason: 
• 
The proposed text modifications do not significantly alter the structure and design of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application concerns an extension of the adult indication to include paediatric patients 2 years of 
age and older with atopic dermatitis (AD). The proposed indication is: Baricitinib is indicated for the 
treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult and paediatric patients 2 years of age and 
older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
In children, adolescents, and adults, AD is a common, chronic relapsing, symptomatic, inflammatory 
skin disease characterised by itch, dry skin, and eczematous lesions. The clinical manifestations of AD 
are overall similar in adults and paediatric patients, although the location and type of skin lesions may 
differ1,2,3. The fundamental pathophysiology of AD, with excessive T cell activation, is similar among 
adults, adolescents, and children18,19. 
The primary aims of therapy are the reduction of skin lesions and of itch, which is the main symptom 
of AD; the ultimate  treatment goal is to reach clear or almost clear skin and no or manageable itch. 
Baricitinib is an orally available, selective JAK inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2, 
and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 216.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
AD is standardly treated with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCS): low-potency TCS for mild 
AD and medium and high-potency TCS for moderate-to-severe AD. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCNI) 
are approved for the treatment of AD in paediatric patients from the age of 2 years with inadequate 
response or intolerance to TCS (tacrolimus) or where treatment with TCS is either inadvisable or not 
possible (pimecrolimus). The use of TCNI’s is commonly restricted to sensitive areas of skin, such as 
eyelids. Several systemic treatments have been authorised in the EU to treat the paediatric population 
with  AD: Adtralza, Dupixent,  and Rinvoq. No systemic treatments are approved for children with 
moderate-severe AD from 2-6 years of age. 
Despite the  recent approval of newer systemic treatments, there remains an unmet medical need for 
AD paediatric patients who do not respond to currently approved systemic therapies and for paediatric 
patients with  AD of 2 – 6  years of age.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The baricitinib clinical development programme for paediatric AD includes one global clinical study 
(JAIP)  to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in paediatric patients with moderate-to-
severe AD. 
In JAIP, the results of the PK lead-in period (period 2) were used to confirm the appropriate dose 
selection for the age groups. Then, new patients were enrolled in the randomised, double-blind study 
part (period 3). In the double-blind part of the study, 483 participants  with moderate-severe AD were 
enrolled, with n=350  aged 10 to <18 years and n=133 participants aged 2 to <10 years old. 
Participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to placebo, baricitinib low-dose QD, medium-dose QD, or high-
dose QD. Accordingly, the daily doses for participants 10 to <18 years old were 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 
mg; the doses for participants 2 to <10 years old were 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg. Oral suspension was 
used for patients <10 years of age, and patients ≥10 years of age were supplied with tablets. 
Randomisation was stratified according to disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4). Background therapy with 
emollients and with medium-potency and/or low-potency TCS and topical TCNI for use on active 
lesions, until lesions were under control, was included for all patients. The primary outcome was IGA 0 
or 1 at week 16. EASI75 at week 16 and improvement ≥4 points in Itch NRS (patients ≥10 years only) 
at weeks 4 and 16,  were among the secondary outcomes that were adjusted for multiplicity. Instead of 
the Itch NRS, the PRISM was used to assess itch in children <10 years of age, not adjusted for 
multiplicity. 
Patients who had participated in study periods 2 or 3 were eligible to continue in the long-term 
extension period for up to 4 additional years of treatment (period 4). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Multiplicity  was handled using the graphical testing procedure. Accordingly, the treatment effects of 
baricitinib high  dose were statistically significantly different as compared with placebo, on all 16-week 
key efficacy endpoints and the Itch NRS 4-point improvement at 4 weeks. Conversely, treatment 
effects of the baricitinib  medium and low doses versus placebo, were not statistically significant for any 
of the study endpoints. 
Primary endpoint 
At week 16, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 was 42% in  the high dose group, as compared 
to 16%  in the placebo group (p<0.0001) in the ITT population. In the 4 planned sensitivity analyses, 
the treatment effect in IGA 0 or 1 of the high dose compared to placebo remained statistically 
significant. From week 4 to week 16, the treatment effects in the high dose group were larger than 
those in the medium dose group and the low dose and placebo groups. 
Key secondary endpoints 
At week 16, there was a (multiplicity adjusted) statistically significant treatment  effect of baricitinib 
high dose (4 mg equivalent), as compared to placebo, in EASI75 and Itch NRS ≥4 points 
improvement, supported by treatment effects in EASI90 and SCORAD75. At week 16, the proportion of 
patients with  EASI75 was 53% in the high dose group, as compared to 32% in the placebo group 
(p<0.01)  in the ITT population; the proportion of patients (>10  years) with Itch response ≥4 points 
was 36% in the  high dose group, as compared to 16% in the placebo group (p<0.05) in the ITT 
population. At week 4, the difference in ≥4 points improvement in Itch NRS was (multiplicity adjusted) 
statistically significant  (p=0.0026),  with  32% in the  high dose group and 7.3% in the placebo group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 105/110 
 
 
 
At week 16, the LS mean (SE) change from baseline in PRISM score was -0.28 (0.16) in the high dose 
group and 0.02 (0.15)  in the placebo group (p=0.12). 
Subgroups 
The predefined subgroup analyses using the IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (primary endpoint) and EASI75 as 
endpoints showed that  none of the interaction terms (subgroup*treatment) were statistically 
significant (p<0.10).   
The treatment effect in IGA 0 or 1 in the high dose group, as compared to placebo, was numerically 
smaller in children weighing <30 kg who were on 2 mg, as compared to children and adolescents 
weighing ≥30kg who  were on 4 mg (Figure 13). In both weight groups there was a visible dose-
response relationship. 
Maintenance 
More patients from the high dose group had at least some response (IGA 0, 1 or 2) at week 16 of the 
placebo-controlled randomised period and continued on their original dose (n=81) as compared to the 
lower dose groups and placebo (n=57). In the high dose group, the proportion of patients with an 
EASI75 was 77% at week 16, and declined over time with 69% at week 20 and 47% at week 52, 
which was <10%  higher than the EASI75 response in the responders in the placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Itch NRS was only applied in patients  >10 years of age; for younger patients, the PRISM was used and 
completed by caregivers. The PRISM is not finally validated, and the treatment effect between 
baricitinib high  dose and placebo was not statistically significant but was numerically more favourable 
for the high dose than for placebo.  
There was a relatively small treatment effect in patient-assessed symptom severity (POEM) and no 
effect in patient-assessed impact on daily living (IDQOL/CDQOL) and anxiety and depression 
(PROMIS). Despite these small treatment effect and no effect in POEM, IDQOL/CDQOL and PROMIS, 
the effects on primary and key secondary outcomes on signs (IGA 0 or 1, EASI75) and the results on 
the main symptom itch (Itch response) are deemed sufficiently supportive for clinical relevance of the 
treatment effects. 
As the 4-year study JAIP is still ongoing, long-term maintenance effects in paediatric patients aged 2-
18 years is not yet fully established. Despite uncertainties on the long-term maintained, the open-label 
period 4 of JAIP with data up to week 52 supports the efficacy maintenance.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data for baricitinib in paediatric patients with AD stems from one pivotal ‘phase 3’ study (JAIP), 
including 467  patients. At the time of data cut-off, 385 patients were exposed to baricitinib for over 52 
weeks, 286 in the older age group ≥10 years. After the upcoming completion of the study, long-term 
safety data in the youngest age group 2-10 years will be available for a maximum of 133 patients. 
No deaths were reported during the JAIP study. Rates of SAEs were low but highest in the high dose 
baricitinib group and the placebo group. No differences in the rates of TEAEs or AEs between placebo 
and baricitinib led to discontinuation  of treatment. 
Common adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 106/110 
 
 
 
In the placebo-controlled period, TEAEs by SOC that occurred more frequently in high dose baricitinib 
compared to placebo, were gastro-intestinal disorders (15% for high dose baricitinib versus 11% for 
placebo), blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.3% versus 1.6%), and investigations (3.3% versus 
1.6%).  TEAEs by PT that occurred more frequently in high dose baricitinib compared to placebo were 
abdominal pain (5.0% versus 2.5%), upper respiratory tract infections (4.2% versus 0.8%), diarrhoea 
(4.2%  versus 1.6%), abdominal pain upper (3.3% versus 0.8%), bronchitis (2.5% versus 0.8%), and 
gastro-enteritis and decreased appetite (each 2.5% versus 0%). In line with previous studies in adults, 
a dose-response relationship was observed for respiratory tract infections and gastro-intestinal 
symptoms. 
Infections occurred in 153 patients in both low (n = 50,  42%, IR 68.2) and medium (n = 47,  39%, IR 
63.4)  dose baricitinib groups, and 54 patients (45%, IR 60.7) in high  dose baricitinib versus 45 (37%, 
IR 63.3) in the placebo group in  the Ext BARI set. Most common in the high  dose group versus placebo 
were COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. Eleven patients (2.4%, IR 
1.47)  reported at least one serious infection. Treatment discontinuation due to infections was 
infrequent. Herpes zoster and herpes simplex occurred in a few patients, and one patient had a 
disseminated herpes zoster infection classified as opportunistic (but not a SAE). In the placebo-
controlled period, however, herpes simplex was less common in baricitinib compared to placebo. 
Tuberculosis was not seen. 
Adverse events of special interest and laboratory values 
No cases of adjudicated MACE, other cardiac events, or VTE occurred, nor any malignancy or NMSC. 
Higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were observed in those treated with baricitinib 
compared to the placebo group, and there was an evident dose dependency. Decreased neutrophil 
counts were more common in baricitinib-treated patients (21%) compared to placebo (16%) and were 
mainly mild. Generally, blood cell dyscrasias were infrequent and relatively mild. Abnormal liver 
enzymes were rare. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety in paediatric patients aged 2-18 years is not yet fully established. Long-term safety 
data is currently included as missing information in the RMP. 
In the pivotal study, the dosing was age-based, but the proposed posology is weight-based. The 
weight-based safety data analysis showed higher risks for TEAE’s and SAE’s in patients < 30 kg body 
weight.  The higher (PK) exposure to baricitinib in those patients may explain the higher rate of 
adverse events, implying the highest safety risks in those at the lowest range of the < 30 kg group. 
Therefore, safety in paediatric patients weighing <20 kg will be followed-up post authorisation in a 
category 3 Study of the RMP and through routine monitoring by the MAH. 
Non-clinical data have given rise to concerns about growth and bone development associated with 
treatment with  baricitinib. The current data generally seem reassuring, except for a few cases with 
suggested very early growth plate closure; most of these patients however already had advanced bone 
age at baseline. The follow-up on growth and bone development is too short for drawing firm 
conclusions, and these safety aspects will be monitored in two Category 3 studies of the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the  recent approval of newer systemic treatments, there remains an unmet medical need for 
paediatric AD patients who do not respond to currently approved systemic therapies, especially those 
between 2-6 years of age. Up to now, no systemic treatments are approved for children with 
moderate-severe AD from 2-6 years of age.  
The size of the treatment effect (high dose – placebo) at week 16 was 26% for IGA 0/1, 21% for 
EASI75 and 20% in Itch response, which are considered clinically relevant between-group differences. 
Clinical relevance of the effects in main outcomes is supported by the onset of treatment effect in itch 
and in IGA 0/1 at week 4. As itch is the main symptom of AD, this is a patient-relevant result. The 
caregivers assessed the reduction of Itch in the youngest children, and only a numerical treatment 
effect was present. Still, the results in the older children and other outcomes can be relied on to infer 
that  the high dose will also reduce itch in children <10 years of age. The patient-reported outcomes 
concerning patient-assessed symptom severity (POEM) and patient-assessed impact on daily living 
(IDQOL/CDQOL)  and anxiety and depression (PROMIS), were not clearly supportive due to lack of 
treatment effect. However, the  effects on skin manifestations and itch  are large enough to consider the 
treatment with  baricitinib as patient-relevant. Supportive patient-relevant effects were also found in 
reducing medium-potency TCS (high potency was generally not used). Although it seems that the 
response slowly declines over time, many patients with at least some response after 16 weeks of 
treatment could maintain a good response over 52 weeks. 
The most common TEAEs observed for baricitinib in the treatment of moderate to severe AD in 
paediatric patients were in line with the known ADRs for baricitinib as included in the SmPC, which is 
mainly based on data from adults with RA but also adults with AD and AA. Upper respiratory tract 
infections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, headache, abdominal pain, and acne are among the 
Assessment report  
EMA/436396/2023  
Page 108/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(very) common ADRs for baricitinib in the current SmPC, and these were also identified in the JAIP 
study. These are all considered manageable. The data on growth did not give rise to immediate 
concerns. Longer follow-up for growth and maturation is needed in any case, which is already included 
in the RMP.  Also, patients with lower body weights will be followed up post-marketing, as their 
exposure (Cmax) appeared to be higher than older children and adults. The uncertainty is to some 
extent mitigated,  as paediatric patients will continue to increase in weight till above 30 kg, limiting the 
period of calendar time in relative over-exposure. 
The Art 20 JAK referral imposed stricter warning text (SmPC section 4.4) for serious infection, MACE, 
VTE, and malignancy, including NMSC for baricitinib. It is not considered necessary to add a special 
warning for the paediatric population to point to the  class effects of oral JAK inhibitors covered by the 
Art. 20 referral. The reason is that paediatric patients do not tend to accumulate risk factors for MACE, 
VTE, malignancies and NMSC, and the existing warnings, e.g., for serious infections, NMSC, etc., 
already apply. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Baricitinib is an oral treatment which can be a valuable treatment to address the unmet medical need 
for paediatric AD patients who do not respond to currently approved systemic therapies, especially 
those between 2-6 years of age. The global JAIP study demonstrate that the treatment effects of 
baricitinib high  dose were statistically significantly different as compared with placebo. The overall 
safety profile observed in paediatric patients with AD is generally consistent with that observed in adult 
patients. Overall, baricitinib has a positive effect in the treatment of AD in patients 2 years and older 
with  benefits that outweigh  the risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Olumiant in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in paediatric patients aged 2 years 
and older is positive.

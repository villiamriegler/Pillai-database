2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases in children and 
adolescents. T1DM accounts for over 90% of all childhood and adolescent diabetes.1 Subjects with 
T1DM require lifelong treatment with insulin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming more 
common in adolescents, particularly in the peripubertal period, although the disease remains relatively 
rare apart from in minority populations. Available data suggest that preadolescent children are unlikely 
to have T2DM even if obese.

Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) (Ryzodeg, EMEA/H/C/002499), is a soluble co-formulation of 
the long-acting insulin degludec (IDeg) and rapid-acting insulin aspart (IAsp). The IDegAsp co-
formulation consists of 70% IDeg and 30% IAsp. IDegAsp is approved for use in adults in EU since 21 
January 2013.  
The current ISPAD (International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes) guidelines for 
treatment of children and adolescents with T1DM state that premixed insulins (fixed ratio of basal and 
bolus insulins) are not recommended for paediatric use, since they remove the flexibility offered by 
separate adjustment of the two types. However, this guidance is predominantly based on evidence 
from studies in adolescents. Preadolescent children on premixed insulin, either alone or in combination 
with short- and intermediate-acting insulin, showed similar glycaemic control to those on a 
combination of short- and longer acting insulins. The ISPAD guidelines acknowledge that premixed 
insulins with rapid-acting analogues have recently become available and are used in some countries, 
particularly for prepubertal children on twice daily regimens. The guidelines also acknowledge that 
premixed insulins may be useful to reduce the number of injections when compliance (or adherence) 
to the regimen is a problem. 
The paediatric clinical development programme for IDegAsp (EMEA-C-000479-PIP01-08-M03) was 
designed to build on the data already available for IDegAsp in adults and on the data for IDeg and 
IAsp administered as separate components in the paediatric population.  
The bolus insulin component of IDegAsp, IAsp (marketed under the trade names NovoLog NovoRapid), 
is approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 2 
years. The use of IAsp is well established globally in the paediatric population.  
The basal insulin component of IDegAsp, IDeg (marketed under the trade name Tresiba), is approved 
for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults in EU since January 2013. The use of IDeg in 
adolescents and children from the age of 1 year was approved in the EU in January 2015. This 
approval was based on data from trial NN1250-3561 (referred to as Trial 3561) which was assessed in 
the paediatric variation application (EMEA/H/C/2498/11).  
In this application, the MAH presents data from a 16-week trial NN5401-3816 (referred to as Trial 
3816). Trial 3816 evaluated the efficacy and safety of IDegAsp with a main meal plus IAsp for the 
remaining meals vs. IDet plus meal-time IAsp in children and adolescents (aged 1 to less than 18 
years) with T1DM to support the indication for IDegAsp in the paediatric and adolescent population. In 
addition to this, the applicant has resubmitted data from trial 3561 as a confirmatory therapeutic study 
in this application as well in the procedure EMEA/H/C/2498/11. 
The data from trial 3816 study has been assessed in a recent study report for paediatric studies, P46 
005, in June 2015, in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The clinical development programme for IDeg and IDegAsp in paediatric subjects consisted of the 
following components: 
•  Clinical pharmacology trial – Trial 1995 (Measure #2 of the IDeg paediatric investigational plan 
[PIP]): 
A randomised, single-centre, double-blind, two-period cross-over, single-dose trial investigating 
the pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg and IGlar in children (6-11 years),adolescents (12-17 
years) and adults (18-65 years) with T1DM. This trial was submitted as part of the original 
Marketing authorisation application (MAA) for IDeg. 
•  Therapeutic confirmatory trial – Trial 3561(Measure #3 of the IDeg and IDegAsp PIP): 
A 26-week multinational, multi-centre, open-labelled, randomised, parallel, efficacy and safety 
comparison of IDeg and IDet in children and adolescents 1 to less than 18 years of age with T1DM 
on a basal-bolus regimen with insulin aspart (IAsp) as bolus insulin, followed by a 26-week 
extension investigating long-term safety. 
•  Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling study (Measure #4 of the IDeg PIP and 
IdegAsp): 
A modelling study in children from 1 to less than 18 years of age, compared to adults, all with 
T1DM. The modelling study consisted of a population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data from 
Trials 1982, 1995 and 3561, and an exposure-response study, which was only based on data from 
Trial 3561. The objectives of the two analyses were to develop a population PK model for IDeg in 
children younger than 6 years and to conduct an exposure-response analysis focusing on this age 
group. 
•  Trial NN5401-1982 (Measure #6) of the IDegAsp PIP) (a single-dose trial in subjects with T1DM 
investigating the PK properties of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) in children, adolescents 
and adults, aged from 6 to 65 years, were combined for the population PK analysis.  
•  Therapeutic confirmatory trial- Trial 3816 (Measure #7 of the IDegAsp PIP): Randomised, open-
label, parallel-group, 16-week efficacy and safety non-inferiority study of insulin degludec / insulin 
aspart and insulin detemir with insulin aspart, in children and adolescents with type I diabetes 
mellitus, from 1 to less than 18 years of age.

Table 2 Summary of paediatric clinical pharmacology development programme 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Trial 1982 and Trial 1995 were single dose trials conducted at a single centre in Germany. In Trial 
1982, 12 children (6−11 years), 13 adolescents (12−17 years) and 13 adults (18−65 years) were 
exposed to IDegAsp. In Trial 1995, 13 children (6−11 years), 13 adolescents (12−17 years) and 12 
adults (18−65 years) were exposed to IDeg. 
Trial 3561 was a multinational trial, conducted across 12 countries and including subjects from Europe 
(52%), the US (29%), Japan (16%) and South Africa (3%). A total of 350 subjects were randomised 
to receive either IDeg or IDet in a 1:1 ratio (174 received IDeg and 176 received IDet).  
Approximately 98% of the subjects receiving IDeg completed the main 26-week treatment period. In 
the IDeg group, there were 43 children aged 1−5 years, 70 children aged 6−11 years and 61 
adolescents aged 12−17 years. Blood samples were taken for evaluation of steady state PK at weeks 
2, 12 and 26 (± 3 days). 
IDeg has a long duration of action extending beyond the 24-hour dosing interval in a once-daily dosing 
regimen, and steady state is reached in 2−3 days. Therefore, the clinically relevant PK properties of 
IDeg at steady state were evaluated in a population PK analysis of data from the therapeutic 
confirmatory trial of IDeg in children and adolescents with T1DM (Trial 3561), together with single-
dose data from the clinical pharmacology trials of IDegAsp (Trial 1982) and IDeg (Trial 1995). A total 
of 243 subjects were included in the population PK analysis. 
The results were as follows:

Statistical Analysis 
A population PK model for IDeg in children younger than 6 years was built. In addition to the single 
dose data from 36 subjects from Trial 1995, the population PK analysis also included steady-state data 
from 169 subjects from Trial 3561. The population PK analysis demonstrated that the steady-state 
IDeg exposure was independent of age and the estimated steady-state concentration-time profile for 
small children (1-5 years) was similar to that of children (6-11 years), adolescents (12-17 years) and 
adults (18-65 years).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic properties of IDegAsp in children and adolescents in comparison to adults were 
investigated in Trial 1982 by means of a meal test. Trial 1982 was a single-centre, open-label, parallel 
group trial with single-dose administration of 0.5 U/kg IDegAsp in children (6–11 years), adolescents 
(12–17 years) and adults (18–65 years) with T1DM. 
The shape of the mean plasma glucose profiles obtained over a period of 6 hours following trial product 
administration and meal ingestion was similar in children, adolescents and adults.

The glucose-lowering effect of IDegAsp (as assessed from AUCPG baseline,0-6h,std.meal,SD) was comparable 
for children, adolescents and adults although with a large between-subject variability. Maximum 
plasma glucose concentration after a standard meal (PGmax,meal,SD) and maximum plasma glucose 
excursion (Delta PGmax,meal,SD) were comparable for children, adolescents and adults based on 
descriptive statistics.

In addition to the reporting by age group described in the objectives of Trial 1982, the 
pharmacodynamic properties of IDegAsp were also reported by pubertal status according to Tanner 
stage scoring. Based on the Tanner stage scores, 6 subjects were categorised as prepubertal, and 
19 subjects were categorised as pubertal. In accordance with the pharmacodynamic response analysed 
by age group, there were no apparent differences between the pharmacodynamic response for the 
prepubertal, pubertal and adult groups.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Dedicated clinical pharmacology data for IDegAsp is available from the age of 6. 
Following a single dose (studies 1982 and 1995), exposure and peak concentration of IAsp and IDeg 
were higher in children than in adolescents and adults.  
The population PK analysis indicated that the steady-state IDeg exposure was independent of age and 
the estimated steady-state concentration-time profile for small children (1-5 years) was similar to that 
of children (6-11 years), adolescents (12-17 years) and adults (18-65 years). 
The discrepancy between these pharmacokinetic analyses is deemed to not have any clinical 
implications considering that: 
• 
• 
IDegAsp is individually titrated  
Pharmacodynamic data from study 1982 indicate that the glucose lowering effect of the 
prandial component of IDegAsp is similar in children, adolescents and adults.  
•  Clinical efficacy and safety data in the population applied for has been obtained in study 3816. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program is acceptable. The lower age limit for the indication is addressed in 
the clinical efficacy and clinical safety sections below. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study- Trial 3816 
The main study, trial 3816, investigated the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart once 
daily plus insulin aspart for the remaining meals versus insulin detemir once or twice daily plus meal 
time insulin aspart in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (NN5401-3816) 
Methods 
Trial 3816 was a 16-week multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, 
randomised 1:1), treat-to-target, efficacy and safety trial in children and adolescents with T1DM 
between 1 and 18 years of age. Subjects received one of the following treatment regimens: 
• 
• 
IDegAsp group: IDegAsp OD with a main meal + bolus IAsp for the remaining meals 
IDet group: IDet OD or twice daily (BID) + bolus IAsp at all meals.

Following screening, the subjects were randomised 1:1 to the treatment groups and stratified by age: 
children 1-5 years; children 6-11 years; and adolescents 12-17 years (Figure 2).

The open trial design is considered appropriate since the two treatment arms require different number 
of injections. The trial design was agreed upon with EMA (PDCO) as part of the paediatric investigation 
plan. The study duration is considered adequate since previous studies in adult T1DM patients 
comparing IDeg Asp with IDet have shown that HbA1c levels had stabilised after 12 to 16 weeks of 
treatment. 
Treatments 
Choice of comparator 
IDet (as marketed under the trade name: Levemir®) was chosen as the comparator since it is a long-
acting insulin analogue which is globally approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus from the age 
of 2 years. 
Choice of bolus/mealtime insulin 
IAsp (as marketed under the trade name: NovoRapid® / NovoLog®) was chosen as mealtime insulin 
since it is a rapid-acting insulin analogue which is globally approved for the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus. It is indicated for use in children from the age of 2 years.  
Dosing regimens and insulin dose 
At randomisation, subjects were to switch to either IDegAsp or IDet from their previous insulin 
treatment. At randomisation the Investigator was to reduce the daily total insulin dose by 20 percent 
as per titration algorithm and aim to adjust the basal:bolus ratio to be between 50:50 and 30:70. 
IDegAsp was to be administered OD in connection with a main meal.  
The titration algorithms for basal and bolus insulin specified the PG target and the recommended 
insulin dose adjustments at different PG levels. All subjects were to be individually titrated on a 
continuous basis according to a prespecified PG target range adopted from the International Society for 
Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines (2009). The fasting, pre-meal and bedtime PG 
target was 5.0−8.0 mmol/L (90−145 mg/dL).  
To optimise and maintain glycaemic control, the Investigators were in weekly contact with subjects, 
throughout the trial to discuss glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic episodes, and to assist the 
subjects in adjusting insulin doses. All insulin dose adjustments were made at the discretion of the 
Investigators.  
Titration of insulin degludec/insulin aspart and insulin detemir 
Basal insulin titration was done according to the lowest pre-breakfast SMPG value measured on the 
three days prior to the visit/phone contact for IDegAsp and IDet OD. For IDet BID the morning dose 
adjustment was to be based on the lowest pre-main evening meal SMPG value measured on the three 
days prior to the visit/phone contact and the evening dose was to be based on the respective pre-
breakfast SMPG values.  
Table 9 Adjustment of IDegAsp and IDet doses 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 15/85 
 
 
 
 
 
Titration of insulin aspart  
Titration of IAsp was done either by using sliding scale (see Table 1–5) or doing carbohydrate 
counting. IAsp titration was done once weekly based on the lowest of three SMPG values measured 
prior to the next meal and bedtime on the three days prior to the visit/phone contact:  
• 
• 
• 
Pre-breakfast IAsp was to be adjusted according to the lowest SMPG measured pre-lunch  
Pre-lunch IAsp was to be adjusted according to the lowest SMPG measured before main 
evening meal  
Pre-main evening meal IAsp was to be adjusted according to the lowest SMPG measured at 
bedtime  
Table 10 Adjustment of IAsp doses 
Instead of the above titration guidance, IAsp could be titrated in accordance with principles of flexible 
dosing whereby the meal carbohydrate content and preprandial plasma glucose value were used to 
determine the bolus insulin dose. When using this method, bolus insulin dose adjustment was 
conducted multiple times daily in accordance with the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and the plasma 
glucose correction factor. 
Insulin devices 
All insulin devices used in the trial had the capacity to deliver insulin in increments of 0.5 units.    
The choice of initial dose, comparator and bolus insulin is acceptable. However, nor IDet or IAsp are 
approved below the age of 2 years. A waiver for small children below the age of one with T1DM is 
included in the PIP for IDet. The inclusion of children > 1 years of age is in line with the PIP for 
IDegAsp.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of Trial 3816 was to compare the efficacy of IDegAsp administered OD plus 
meal-time IAsp for the remaining meals in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline 
in HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 16 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Change from baseline in FPG after 16 weeks of treatment 
•  SMPG measurements (8-point profiles) 
o  8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
o  Mean of the 8-point profiles  after 16 weeks of treatment 
o  Fluctuation in the 8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 16/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Prandial PG increment from 8-point profiles after 16 weeks of treatment 
•  SMPG measurements (4-point profiles) obtained throughout the trial for dose adjustments 
o  Mean PG before meals and before bedtime after 16 weeks of treatment 
o  Within subject variability as measured by the CV% after 16 weeks of treatment 
Body Weight  
Body weight change from baseline was summarised descriptively.  
Safety endpoints 
The key safety parameters were insulin dose, AEs, incidence of hypoglycaemia, incidence of 
hyperglycaemia, vital signs, safety laboratory parameters and body weight/BMI. 
The definitions of hypoglycaemic episodes from the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent 
Diabetes (ISPAD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines were used. (Figure 2)  
Figure 3 Classification of hypoglycaemia according to ADA/ISPAD 
The endpoints chosen is considered adequate and clinically relevant  
Sample size 
A total of 346 subjects were planned to be included in this trial, with a minimum of 300 expected to 
complete the trial. As specified in the PIP for IDegAsp,3 at least 344 paediatric patients had to be 
randomised (1:1 ratio) of which at least 60 had to be younger than 6 years of age at inclusion and at 
least 30% and not more than 70% had to be girls. Furthermore, based on feedback from FDA, 
20−25% of those enrolled had to be enrolled from US sites.

Randomisation  
Subjects randomised into the IDet treatment group were allowed to switch from OD to BID dosing. 
Randomisation was stratified by age groups (1 to less than 6 years; 6 to less than 12 years and 12 to 
less than 18 years) to ensure approximately equal distribution of subjects between the treatments 
within each age group 
Blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Statistical methods 
Sample size was determined based on the non-inferiority evaluation. The non-inferiority margin of 
0.4% (absolute) was chosen in accordance with the FDA guidance and was an integral part of the PIP 
for IDegAsp. Sample size was determined using a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test 
of size 2.5% and a zero mean treatment difference (i.e. D=0%). Based on experience from previous 
phase 3 trials in children and adolescents with T1DM treated with insulin a conservative estimate for 
the SD of 1.25% for HbA1c was used in the sample size calculation. With these assumptions, the 
minimum sample size required to meet the primary objective with at least 80% power was 310 
subjects.  
As this was a non-inferiority trial, sample size was determined such that the anticipated power was at 
least 80% in the evaluation of the per protocol (PP) analysis set. Assuming that 10% were to be 
excluded from the PP analysis set, the total number of randomised subjects was to be at least 346 
subjects in order to have at least 80% power in the evaluation of the PP analysis set.  
The following analysis sets were defined in the protocol and/or statistical analysis plan, prior to 
unblinding/release of the treatment randomisation, and in accordance with ICH E9.44  
•  Full analysis set (FAS) – included all randomised subjects. In exceptional cases subjects from 
the FAS could be eliminated. In such cases the elimination was to be justified and 
documented. The statistical evaluation of the FAS followed the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle 
and subjects contributed to the evaluation “as randomised”.  
•  Per protocol (PP) analysis set – consisted of all subjects in the FAS who fulfilled the following 
criteria:  
o  Have not violated any inclusion criteria.  
o  Have not fulfilled any exclusion criteria.  
o  Have a non-missing HbA1c at screening or randomisation.  
o  Have at least one non-missing HbA1c after 12 weeks of exposure. o Have at least 
12 weeks of exposure.  
•  Safety analysis set (SAS) – included all subjects receiving at least one dose of the trial product 
or its comparator. Subjects in the safety set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”.  
The statistical methods were acceptable.

Results 
Recruitment/Numbers analysed 
A total of 362 children and adolescents were randomised, of whom 360 received at least one dose of 
trial product and 342 completed the trial. Of those randomised, 82 were aged 1-5 years, 122 were 
aged 6-11 years and 158 were aged 12-17 years (Table 11, Table 12).

Table 12 Subject disposition – Trial 3816 
The vast majority of subjects 94.5% completed the study. The withdrawals were relatively balanced 
between treatment groups and between age groups. 
Conduct of the study 
A treat-to-target approach with weekly contacts (visits or phone contacts) was implemented in order 
to ensure optimal glycaemic control for all subjects. The titration algorithms for basal and bolus insulin, 
which were provided in the protocol, specified the plasma glucose (PG) target and the recommended 
insulin dose adjustments at different PG levels. All subjects were to be individually titrated on a 
continuous basis according to a pre-specified PG target range adopted from the ISPAD 2009 
guidelines. The fasting, pre-meal and bedtime PG target was 5.0−8.0 mmol/L (90−145 mg/dL). The 
insulin titration guideline provided guidance on adjustments of basal and bolus insulin. All adjustments 
of insulin doses were made at the discretion of the investigator. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
The trial population consisted of children and adolescents with T1DM aged from 1 to less than 18 
years. Females comprised 51.7% of the trial population. Approximately 32% of the subjects were from 
the U.S, 13% were from the Russian Federation and 9% were from Israel. The majority of subjects 
(93.1%) were ‘White’. The majority of subjects (92.3%) were not Hispanic or Latino. 
The demographics and baseline diabetes characteristics at week 0 were comparable between the 
treatment groups apart from slight differences in mean FPG and mean duration of diabetes (Table 13). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 20/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the overall study population, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) FPG at baseline was slightly 
higher in the IDegAsp group than in the IDet group: 8.6 (4.4) mmol/L versus 8.1 (4.2) mmol/L, 
respectively. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was slightly higher in the IDegAsp group than in the 
IDet group: 4.4 (3.7) years versus 3.8 (3.2) years, respectively. 
Table 13 Baseline and diabetes characteristics - descriptive statistics - full analysis set 
Diabetic complications were overall similar in the treatment groups. In total, 14 (3.9%) subjects had 
diabetic complications at screening: 9 (2.5%) subjects had diabetic neuropathy, 4 (1.1%) subjects had 
microalbuminuria and 1 (0.3%) subject was diagnosed with cataract diabetic. There were 5 events of 
diabetic complications in 5 subjects within the IDegAsp group and 9 events of diabetic complications in 
9 subjects within the IDet group.

At the time of inclusion in the trial, 92.0% of subjects were using basal + bolus therapy. The most 
commonly used basal insulins were IDet (45.3%) and insulin glargine (40.6%). The most commonly 
used bolus insulin was IAsp (58.6%). 
Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups. Only one child under 
the age of 2 years was included (IDet) and the youngest child included in the IDegAsp was aged 2.2 
years. Duration of diabetes was slightly longer in the IDegAsp treated group, however, numerically 
more diabetes complications were reported in the IDet treated group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
IDegAsp OD + IAsp effectively maintained glycaemic control and was non-inferior to IDet + IAsp in 
terms of change from baseline in HbA1c, with an estimated mean treatment difference (IDegAsp OD − 
IDet) of −0.04%-points [−0.23; 0.15]95% CI (Table 8). Superiority was not confirmed.  
Table 14 Trial 3816 HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment - primary statistical analysis – full 
analysis set 
The trend for the development of HbA1c over time was similar in the IDegAsp and IDet group, with a 
minor reduction from baseline to week 16. HbA1c at baseline (week 0) was similar in the IDegAsp and 
IDet group with an observed mean (SD) of 8.1% in the IDegAsp group and 8.1% in the IDet group. At 
week 16 the observed mean (SD) HbA1c was 7.9% in the IDegAsp group and 7.8% in the IDet group. 
The observed change from baseline to week 16 was −0.3%-point in both the IDegAsp and IDet group, 
calculated based on subjects with available HbA1c measurements at both baseline and week 16. Within 
both the IDegAsp and the IDet treatment group, the trend for HbA1c was similar in all age groups, 
with a minor reduction from baseline to week 16.

Figure 4 Trial 3816 HbA1c (%) by treatment week - mean plots (upper panel: all subjects; lower panel: age groups)- 
Sensitivity analyses were performed and all sensitivity analysis showed an estimated mean treatment 
difference in line with the main analysis and supported the conclusion of non-inferiority. 
Both treatments showed a lowering trend for HbA1c. The primary endpoint was reached showing that 
IDegAsp was non-inferior to IDet+Asp. There was no statistically significant difference between the 
two treatment arms. The upper limit of the CI was 0.15% which is well within both the pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin of 0.4 % and the currently recommended non-inferiority margin of 0.3 %. 
A similar trend for HbA1c reduction was observed in all age groups irrespective of treatment. 
Sensitivity analyses were all in line with the primary analysis, thus the outcome appears robust. 
Secondary endpoints 
Fasting plasma glucose 
After 16 weeks of treatment, FPG was 8.4 mmol/L with IDegAsp OD + IAsp and 8.3 mmol/L with IDet 
+ IAsp. The observed mean change from baseline at week 16 was −0.3 mmol/L with IDegAsp OD + 
IAsp and −0.1 mmol/L with IDet + IAsp. The estimated mean treatment difference (IDegAsp OD – 
IDet) was not statistically significant, 0.31 mmol/L [−0.70; 1.33]95%CI mmol/L.

Figure 5 Trial 3816 Fasting plasma glucose by treatment week – mean plots 
Within the IDegAsp treatment group mean FPG followed the overall trend (as seen for all subjects) 
from baseline to week 16 in children 1-5 years and adolescents 12-17 years, and tended to increase in 
children 6-11 years, which was caused by a few outliers with elevated FPG levels at week 16. 
Within the IDet treatment group mean FPG followed the overall trend (as seen for all subjects) from 
baseline to week 16 in all age groups. 
8-point self-measured plasma glucose profiles 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in the mean of the 8 point profile, in 
prandial PG increments (mean of all meals, breakfast, lunch and main evening meal) or in the SMPG 
fluctuation at 16 weeks. Trends were similar for the shape of the 8-point SMPG profiles across age 
groups at week 16 for both treatment groups.

4-point SMPG for dose adjustment 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-main 
evening meal or pre-bedtime SMPG at 16 weeks.  
Within-subject variability as measured by coefficient of variation (%) after 16 weeks 
Within-subject variability in pre-breakfast SMPG after 16 weeks was similar for the two treatment 
groups; estimated mean treatment ratio IDegAsp OD/IDet = 1.02 [0.91; 1.14]95%CI. 
No statistically significant different was seen between the treatment arms in any of the secondary 
endpoints which supports that IDegAsp OD+IAsp for the remaining meals is non-inferior to IDet or 
BID+ mealtime IAsp. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Insulin doses over time – Trial 3816  
In clinical practice, determination of insulin dose is based upon individual needs, considering the 
balance between glycaemic control and risk of hypoglycaemia.  
Trial 3816 was conducted with a treat-to-target principle; the insulin dose was adjusted for each 
individual subject with the aim of achieving similar pre-breakfast SMPG targets for each treatment 
group, with acceptable risk of hypoglycaemia. There was an observed transient increase in pre-
breakfast SMPG at the beginning of the trial, possibly related to the protocol-recommended 20% total 
insulin dose reduction at randomisation. This is not considered relevant for clinical practice, as dose 
adjustment at switching should take into consideration current glycaemic control and insulin regimen. 
Overall, the mean total insulin dose increased slightly in both treatment groups from week 1 to week 
16 (from 0.79 to 0.88 units/kg in the IDegAsp group and from 0.89 to 1.01 units/kg in the IDet 
group). At the end of the treatment period there was a 14% lower total daily insulin dose requirement 
in the IDegAsp group compared to the IDet group, primarily consisting of a 28% lower basal daily dose 
requirement.  
The lower basal insulin requirement in the IDegAsp group vs. the IDet group may be related to the fact 
that 54.2% of subjects were using IDet BID at the end of the trial, as it is well-known that BID dosing 
generally leads to higher basal doses.The daily bolus insulin dose (total IAsp administered including 
the IAsp component of IDegAsp) was similar between the two treatments

Number of injections 
In trial 3816 a similar level of glycaemic control was achieved with a lower total number of injections 
per day in the IDegAsp group compared to the IDet group (mean of 3.6 vs. 4.9 total injections per 
day, respectively, at week 16).The Applicant has provided these data in the RSI.

2.4.2.  Supportive study- Trial 3561 
Introduction 
A trial investigating the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec in children and adolescents 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus (Trial 3561) 
Trial 3561 was a 1:1 randomised safety and efficacy trial comparing IDeg and IDet as basal insulin in 
combination with insulin aspart (IAsp) as bolus insulin in children and adolescents aged 1 to less than 
18 years with T1DM. Trial 3561 were divided into a 26-week main trial period followed by a 26-week 
extension period for those who consented to continue in the extension trial. 
This study report was assessed in the procedure EMEA/H/C/II/11. The use of IDeg in adolescents and 
children from the age of 1 year was approved in the EU in January 2015.  
A short description of this study with the main findings is given below. 
Figure 7 Trial 3561 – trial design 
A total of 346 subjects were planned to be included in this trial, with a minimum of 300 planned to 
complete the main part and a minimum of 200 planned to complete the extension. As specified in the 
PIPs for IDeg and IDet, at least 80 of the randomised subjects had to be children aged 1-5 years (both 
inclusive), and at least 30% and no more than 70% should be girls. Eligible subjects were 1 to less 
than 18 years of age, diagnosed with T1DM, treated for at least 3 months on any insulin regimen (no 
OADs were allowed), with a total daily insulin dose ≤ 2.00 units/kg and at screening HbA1c was to be 
≤ 11%. Subjects with clinically significant concomitant diseases were not included in this trial. 
Subjects who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were eligible to 
participate in the trial.  
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of Trial 3561 was to confirm the efficacy of IDeg administered once daily plus 
mealtime IAsp in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline in glycosylated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 26 weeks of treatment. This was done by comparing the difference in 
change in HbA1c between IDeg + IAsp and IDet + IAsp to with a non-inferiority limit of 0.4%, and if 
non-inferiority was confirmed with a superiority limit of 0%.

Efficacy endpoints 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 26 weeks of treatment.  
Secondary endpoints 
Efficacy was addressed in terms of the following assessments from which endpoints were to be 
calculated, analysed and presented: 
•  Change from baseline in HbA1cafter 52 weeks of treatment (analysed by central laboratory) 
•  Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) after 26 and 52 weeks (analysed by 
central laboratory) 
•  SMPG measurements (8-point profiles)after 26 and 52 weeks 
o  8-point profiles  
o  Mean of the 8-point profiles  
o  Fluctuation in the 8-point profiles  
o  Prandial PG increment from 8-point profiles 
•  SMPG measurements (4-point profiles) obtained throughout the trial for dose adjustment and 
analysed after 26 and 52 weeks 
o  Mean PG before breakfast  
o  Within-subject variability as measured by CV%  
•  Steady state IDeg and IDet plasma concentrations (during the first 26 weeks of treatment). 
Continuous glucose measurements (CGM), hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia were regarded as 
safety parameters.

Table 16 Subject disposition for Trial 3561 main trial period and extension period 
Baseline data 
The trial population was generally well balanced with only marginal differences between the two 
treatment arms in the demographic characteristics. Table 17 and Table 18.  The majority of subjects 
were ‘White’ (75%) with the second most common race being ‘Asian-non-Indian’(16%). 3% of 
subjects were of hispanic or latino origin, and 97% were of ‘Not hispanic or latino’ origin. Other 
baseline characteristics were also similar with the exception of slightly higher mean HbA1cand FPG in 
the IDeg arm (8.2% and 9.0 mmol/L) than in the IDet arm (8.0% and 8.4mmol/L)). The proportion of 
subjects with diabetes complications at baseline was very low. Only 4 subjects reported diabetes 
complications at screening (IDeg: 1 subject with diabetic ketoacidosis; IDet: 3 subjects with diabetic 
neuropathy). The frequency of concomitant illnesses at screening was low with both treatments and, 
with the exception of seasonal allergy; no concomitant illnesses were reported in more than 5% of 
subjects.  
The treatment arms were well matched with respect to insulin regimen at screening. The vast majority 
of subjects (95.7% of randomised subjects) were using basal-bolus therapy, and in both treatment 
arms, IDet was the most widely used basal insulin followed by insulin glargine (IGlar).

IAsp was the most commonly used bolus insulin. Overall the baseline demographics and diabetes 
characteristics across the age groups were in line with those of all subjects with the exception of small 
differences for sex and FPG in children aged 1-5 years in the IDet group. In this group, the 
male/female distribution was approximately 40:60 as opposed to approximately 56:44 for all IDet 
subjects, and the mean FPG was 9.2 mmol/L compared to 8.4 mmol/L for all IDet subjects.

≤0.4%(estimated treatment difference, IDeg –IDet: 0.15%-points [-0.03;0.32]95%CI). Non-inferiority 
was also confirmed based on the PP analysis set (IDeg –IDet: 0.19 %-points [0.01;0.37]95%CI), and 
the results of the sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint, including an analysis based on the 
repeated measures model, were similar to that of the primary analysis.  
There was an overall reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks with both treatments with the 
observed HbA1c being reduced from 8.2% to 8.0% in the IDeg arm and from 8.0% to 7.7% in the 
IDet arm. The overall change over time in HbA1c within the 3 age groups was comparable to that seen 
for all subjects. Thus, in all age groups the observed mean HbA1c was lower after 26 weeks of 
treatment than at baseline for both treatments. 
HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment 
The reduction in HbA1c was maintained after 52 weeks of treatment in both treatment groups 
indicating that the glycaemic effect was sustained, and at the end of trial, the estimated mean HbA1c 
was similar for IDeg and IDet with an estimated treatment difference of -0.01 %-points 
[-0.20;0.19] 95%CI). As seen for the 26-week data, the sensitivity analysis using repeated 
measurements as well as the analyses based on the PP analysis set and the extension trial set, 
including all subjects who continued in the extension period, supported this result. The observed 
change from baseline was -0.27 %-point with IDeg and -0.22 %-point with IDet, and the observed 
mean HbA1c after 52 weeks was 7.9% in the IDeg arm and 7.8% in the IDet arm. 
The mean profiles for HbA1c over time were similar with the two treatments, See Figure 8. For both 
treatments, the initial reduction in HbA1c was followed by a slight increase from Week 12 to 38 before 
it decreased again towards the end of the trial. The slight increase during the middle period of the trial 
was primarily driven by the adolescent age groups. Effective glycaemic control in adolescents is 
particularly challenging due to multiple factors including physiological changes of puberty (increased 
insulin resistance), and psychosocial factors. This age group is often associated with deterioration in 
glycaemic control. However, it was notable that in Trial 3561, the observed HbA1c was lower after 52 
weeks of treatment than at baseline across all age groups in both the IDeg and the IDet treatment 
arms.

Secondary endpoints 
Fasting plasma glucose 
During the trial, mean FPG decreased in the IDeg treatment groups and increased in the IDet 
treatment group, . With IDeg, the observed mean FPG decreased from 9.0 mmol/L at baseline to 7.8 
mmol/L after 52 weeks of treatment, whereas it increased in the IDet treatment group from 8.4 
mmol/L at baseline to 9.5 mmol/L, and the change from baseline in FPG was statistically significantly 
different for the two treatments (IDeg-IDet: -1.62mmol/L[-2.84; -0.41]95%CI).The overall change over 
time in the 3 age groups was comparable to that seen for all subjects in both treatment groups.

8-point self-measured plasma glucose profiles 
The mean of the 8-point SMPG profile was statistically significantly lower with IDeg compared to IDet 
after 52 weeks of treatment with an estimated treatment difference(IDeg –IDet) of −0.79mmol/L 
[−1.32;−0.26] 95% CI.The lower mean reflected the statistically significantly lower SMPG values(IDeg 
–IDet) at post-breakfast (−1.57 mmol/L [−2.65; −0.49] 95% CI), post-dinner (−1.85 mmol/L [−2.95 
; −0.75]95%CI), and pre-breakfast on the following day (−0.94 mmol/L [−1.77; −0.11] 95% CI). At 
the remaining time points there were no statistically significant differences. 
4-point self-measured plasma glucose for dose adjustment 
The 4-point SMPG profiles, which were measured weekly on 3 consecutive days, were used for the 
titration of the insulin doses. The observed mean pre-breakfast value was higher in the IDeg arm than 
in the IDet arm at baseline but was lower after one week of treatment and throughout the remaining 
52-week treatment period. The mean pre-breakfast SMPG was statistically significantly lower in the

IDeg arm compared to the IDet arm (IDeg − IDet: −0.76mmol/L [−1.46; −0.05] 95% CI) after 52 
weeks of treatment. Hence, the result based on self-measured PG values were in accordance with the 
lower FPG concentrations obtained in the IDeg treatment arm based on central laboratory analyses. 
Figure 10 Trial 3561 Mean pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose for dose adjustment 
by treatment week – full analysis set 
The within-subject variation as determined by the coefficient of variation (%) in pre-breakfast SMPG of 
the 4-point profiles was similar for the treatment arms after 52 weeks of treatment with an estimated 
treatment ratio (IDeg/IDet) of 1.04 [0.93; 1.16] 95% CI. 
Plasma concentrations of basal insulin 
As part of the agreed PIPs for IDeg and IDet, a population PK analysis based on the total IDeg and 
IDet concentrations was carried out (based on blood samples drawn after 2, 12, and 26 weeks) with 
the aim to investigate the differences in PK between the three age groups, if any. There was no 
apparent change in plasma concentrations of IDeg measured at Weeks 2, 12 and 26, whereas the 
plasma concentrations of IDet increased slightly over time. 
Insulin doses over time 
Titration algorithms for basal and bolus insulin were provided in the protocol. The same titration 
algorithm was used for IDeg and IDet, and the algorithm specified the PG target range and the 
recommended dose adjustments at different PG levels. All subjects were to be individually titrated with 
the aim of achieving a pre-specified fasting PG target of 5.0-8.0 mmol/L as recommended by the 
International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Guidelines. Investigators were in 
weekly contact with subjects throughout the trial in order to optimise and maintain glycaemic control 
by individually adjusting insulin doses taking diet, activity level and hypoglycaemic episodes into 
account. All insulin dose adjustments were done at the discretion of the Investigator. The mean IDeg 
dose remained relatively constant throughout the trial with the mean daily IDeg dose being 0.37 
units/kg at baseline and 0.38 units/kg at the end of the trial. In contrast, the mean daily IDet dose 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 39/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased from 0.40 to 0.55 units/kg. The lower mean dose of IDeg compared to IDet may be related 
to the long duration of IDeg which allows OD dosing in all subjects, whereas IDet could be dosed either 
OD or BID. The mean daily bolus insulin dose increased slightly during the trial in both treatment 
groups. From Week 1 to 52, it increased from 0.50 to 0.55 units/kg in the IDeg arm and from 0.52 to 
0.58 units/kg in the IDet arm. After 52 weeks of treatment, the ratio of the observed mean basal 
insulin doses (units/kg) was lower by 30% in the IDeg arm as compared to the IDet arm, whereas the 
bolus insulin dose ratio was close to 1, indicating that subjects received almost similar doses of IAsp in 
both the IDeg and IDet treatment arms. Therefore, the total daily dose ratio, which was 18% lower 
with IDeg than IDet, primarily reflected the lower amount of basal insulin used in the IDeg arm. 
The data from Trial 3561 was assessed in the procedure EMEA/H/C/2498/II/11 why these data not 
were assessed in detail in this procedure. 
2.4.3.  Discussion of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The data from study NN5401-3816 (hereafter referred to as study 3816) has been assessed in a recent 
study report for paediatric studies, P46 005, in June 2015, in accordance with article 46 of regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. In this variation the data from this trial is submitted to support the indication for 
IDegAsp (Ryzodeg) to treat children and adolescents (aged 1 to less than 18 years) with T1DM. Study 
3816 is part of the PIP agreed upon with EMA (PDCO).  
Trial 3816 was a 16-week multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, 
randomised, treat-to-target, efficacy and safety trial in children and adolescents with T1DM between 1 
and 18 years of age.  
The primary objective of the trial was to confirm the efficacy of IDegAsp administered OD plus meal-
time IAsp for the remaining meals in controlling glycaemia with respect to change from baseline in 
HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety 
between the two treatment groups. The endpoints chosen are considered adequate and clinically 
relevant. 
The general study design was adequate. A randomised, open-label trial was chosen since the two 
treatment regimens require different number of daily injections. This is acceptable. Previous studies in 
adult T1DM patients comparing IDegAsp with IDet showed that HbA1c levels had stabilised after 12 to 
16 weeks of treatment. The study duration is therefore considered adequate in the paediatric 
population. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate. Due to the rise in the incidence of 
T1DM noted in many countries, with a disproportionately greater increase in children under 5 years, 
inclusion of the very young age groups (1-18 years) in this trial was required by EMA (PDCO). 
The choice of initial dose, comparator and bolus insulin is acceptable. However, nor IDet or IAsp are 
approved below the age of 2 years, although limited data is available from other clinical trials and no 
safety concerns have arisen from these data. The inclusion of children > 1 years of age is in line with 
the PIP for IDegAsp. 
The statistical methods were adequate. The chosen non-inferiority margin of 0.4 % is generous as 
currently a margin of 0.3 % is recommended. However, the chosen non-inferiority margin could serve 
its purpose for calculating the sample size and the final assessment depends on the actual outcome of 
the data. 
The study included 362 subjects randomised 1:1 to the two treatment groups. Overall 94.5 % of 
patients completed the study. Withdrawals were evenly distributed between treatments and age 
groups. The baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between groups. Notably, only one

child below the age of 2 years was included (IDet). Duration of diabetes was slightly longer in the 
IDegAsp treated group, however, numerically more diabetes complications were reported in the IDet 
treated group. Both treatments resulted in a reduction of HbA1c compared to baseline (-0.27 % vs -
0.23 % for IDegAsp and IDet, respectively) and non-inferiority was demonstrated. The upper limit of 
the CI was 0.15 % which is well within both the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.4 % and the 
currently recommended non-inferiority margin of 0.3 %. A similar trend for HbA1c reduction was 
observed in all age groups irrespective of treatment. Sensitivity analyses were all in line with the 
primary analysis, thus the outcome appears robust. 
The outcome of the secondary endpoints was in line with the primary endpoint. No statistically 
significant differences were observed between treatments. 
The total insulin dose throughout the study was slightly lower in the IDegAsp treated group compared 
to the IDet treated group. This was due to a lower basal insulin dose in the IDegAsp treated group. 
The bolus doses were comparable between groups. In both treatment groups, as expected, the highest 
dose per body weight was observed in the age group 12-17 years. The lower total insulin dose in the 
IDegAsp group is in line with the findings in study 3561 (see below). 
The mean total number of injections per day was lower in the IDegAsp group than in the IDet group 
for the overall population (3.6 versus 4.9 injections) and for each of the 3 age groups, with similar 
magnitude of difference between IDegAsp and IDet in each age group. There was wide variation in the 
daily number of injections used in all age groups and in both treatment arms: from 1 to 5 injections 
per day in the IDegAsp group and from 1 to 6 injections in the IDet group.  
In conclusion, trial 3816 IDegAsp OD+IAsp for the remaining meals was shown to be non-inferior 
compared to IDet OD or BID+ mealtime IAsp. Comparable glycaemic control was achieved with a 
lower total insulin dose in the IDegAsp treated group. Both treatments showed sustained efficacy in 
the paediatric population over 16 weeks. 
The results of trial 3561 has already been submitted and assessed with procedure 
EMEA/H/C/XXXX/LEG/WS/0501, in accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
and in the procedure EMEA/H/C/II/11. The use of IDeg in adolescents and children from the age of 1 
year was approved in the EU in January 2015.  
Trial 3561 was an open-labelled, randomised (1:1), treat-to-target, safety and efficacy trial comparing 
IDeg and IDet as basal insulin in combination with IAsp as bolus insulin in subjects with T1DM between 
1 and less than 18 years of age. Randomisation was stratified by age groups (1 to less than 6 years; 6 
to less than 12 years and 12 to less than 18 years). 
The design was similar to the design of the previous therapeutic confirmatory trials with IDeg and 
standard methods were applied. Statistical methods are acceptable.  
In trial 3561, IDeg OD plus meal-time IAsp was non-inferior to IDet OD or BID plus meal-time IAsp in 
reducing HbA1c after 26 weeks treatment (estimated mean treatment difference, IDeg−IDet: 0.15%-
points [−0.03; 0.32] 95% CI). A further improvement in glycaemic control was seen in the IDeg 
treatment group in the 26-week extension period based on FPG, mean of the 8-point profiles and pre-
breakfast SMPG based on 4-point profiles. The mean daily basal insulin dose (units/kg) was lower with 
IDeg than IDet throughout the trial and remained relatively constant with IDeg, whereas there was an 
increase over time with IDet. Bolus doses (units/kg) were similar for the two treatments and increased 
slightly over time with both treatments. Comparable glycaemic control, as assessed by change in 
HbA1c, was achieved with lower daily insulin doses with IDeg OD + IAsp compared to IDet (OD or 
BID) + IAsp. Thus, the outcome of study 3561 was in line with the results in study 3816.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, trial 3816 has shown that IDegAsp OD+ IAsp for the remaining meals is non-inferior to 
IDet OD or BID+ bolus IAsp. The supportive study trial 3561 has shown that IDeg OD+ bolus IAsp is 
non inferior to IDet OD or BID+ bolus IAsp. In addition this supportive study gives data on persistence 
of efficacy for the IDeg molecule over one year of treatment.  
These two confirmatory therapeutic studies include 697 patients which are considered to be sufficient 
amount of data to support the efficacy of IDegAsp in children. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile for IDegAsp has been investigated in the clinical program supporting the marketing 
authorisation. The results demonstrate that the safety profile of IDeg in patients with T1DM and T2DM 
as monotherapy or in combination with oral antidiabetic agents is in line with the safety profile of other 
insulin analogues. The major safety issues are hypoglycaemia, injection site reactions and the potential 
risk of antibody formation. 
2.5.1.  Patient exposure Trial 3816 
A total of 360 subjects who received at least one dose of trial product were included in the safety 
analysis set: 181 subjects in the IDegAsp treatment group and 179 subjects in the IDet treatment 
group. Of those randomised, 94.5% subjects completed 16 weeks of trial treatment. Exposure was 
similar in the two treatment groups. Mean (SD) exposure was 0.30 (0.03) years with a range of 0.06 
to 0.35 years in the IDegAsp group and 0.30 (0.04) years with a range of 0.02 to 0.34 years in the 
IDet group. 
Insulin dose 
At randomisation the total daily insulin dose was to be reduced by 20%. Subjects were transferred 
from pre-trial basal insulin to IDegAsp or IDet aiming for a basal:bolus ratio of between 50:50 and 
30:70 with no specific recommendations for basal dose reduction. Daily basal insulin dose relates to 
the daily dose of IDet or IDeg (70% of the IDegAsp OD dose).  
In terms of dosing patterns, the mean total daily insulin dose was lower in the IDegAsp group 
compared to the IDet group throughout the trial. At week 16, the mean (SD) total daily insulin doses 
were 0.88 (0.29) vs. 1.01 (0.40) units/kg in the IDegAsp and IDet groups, respectively. 
In the IDegAsp treatment group, mean total daily insulin dose per body weight was highest in 
adolescents throughout the trial; mean dose in children 1-5 years and 6-11 years was similar 
throughout the trial.  
In the IDet treatment group, mean total daily insulin dose per body weight was lowest in children 1-5 
years and highest in adolescents 12-17 years throughout the trial. 
In the IDet treated group 54.2 % of patients were using IDet BID.

2.5.2.  Adverse events in Trial 3816 
In Trial 3816, the overall rate of AEs was similar in the two treatment groups (915 vs. 853 events per 
100 PYE in the IDegAsp and IDet groups, respectively). The majority of events were mild or moderate 
in severity and were considered as unlikely to be related to the trial products. No deaths were 
reported. Apart from hypoglycaemia, many of the commonly reported AEs appeared to be related to 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016

infectious diseases as could be expected in this age group. The observed rate of serious adverse 
events (SAEs) was low in each group, but numerically higher with IDegAsp than with IDet (26 vs. 13 
events per 100 PYE, respectively).  
The rates of AEs considered possibly or probably related to trial product (IDegAsp or IDet), as judged 
by the investigator, were 47 vs. 37 events per 100 PYE, respectively, and approximately 75% of all 
subjects in either treatment group had an outcome of recovered at end of trial. 
No unexpected differences between the 3 age groups with respect to type of AEs were observed in the 
treatment groups. A slightly higher rate of AEs in the IDegAsp treatment group for children 1-5 years 
was observed. 
The most frequent AEs occurring in ≥5%  of the subjects are summarised in Table 20. Apart from 
hypoglycaemic episodes reported on the hypoglycaemic episode form, the most frequently reported 
AEs (≥5%) in both treatment groups were ‘headache’, ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘abdominal pain upper’, 
‘pyrexia’ and ‘vomiting’

The overall reporting of adverse events were somewhat higher in the IDegAsp treated group, however, 
the rate of events deemed to be related to treatment was low and comparable between groups. Apart 
from hypoglycaemia, the most commonly reported events appears to be related to infectious diseases 
as could be expected in this age group. 
2.5.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events-trial 3816 
The rates of SAEs were low: 14 SAEs reported by 11 (6.1%) subjects in the IDegAsp group and seven 
SAEs reported by 7 (3.9%) subjects in the IDet group. For IDegAsp, the most frequently reported SAE 
was hypoglycaemia. One subject in the IDegAsp group was withdrawn from the trial during the 16-
week treatment period due to an AE of ‘hypoglycaemic seizure’. Additionally, 1 subject in the IDet 
group withdrew due to hypoglycaemic events judged by the investigator to be related to the trial 
product reported under ‘other’ reasons for withdrawal.

Serious adverse events were few and the most commonly reported event was hypoglycaemia. A 
hypoglycaemia related event was also the reason for withdrawal of one subject in the IDegAsp treated 
group. Hypoglycaemia was also the most common reason for dose reductions.

2.5.4.  Hypoglycaemic episodes in trial 3816 
In the 3816 trial, hypoglycaemic episodes were evaluated based on the International Society for 
Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD 2009) classification, See Figure 3. (PG ≤3.9 mmol/L or 
PG>3.9 mmol/L in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms) and a Novo Nordisk definition of 
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (severe hypoglycaemia and/or those with PG <3.1 mmol/L)  
Hypoglycaemia reported as adverse event 
A hypoglycaemic episode was to be reported as an AE if it fulfilled the definition of an SAE or a medical 
event of special interest (severe hypoglycaemia as per ISPAD definition). Hypoglycaemia was reported 
as an AE for 11 (6.1%) subjects in the IDegAsp group (12 events) and for 3 (1.7%) subjects in the 
IDet group (4 events). In addition, hypoglycaemic seizure was reported as an AE for 2 (1.1%) subjects 
in the IDegAsp group (3 events). Hypoglycaemia-related SAEs (hypoglycaemia and/or hypoglycaemic 
seizure) were reported for 6 (3.3%) subjects in the IDegAsp group (6 events) and for 1 (0.6%) subject 
in the IDet group (1 event). In addition, one subject in the IDegAsp group experienced a non-serious 
AE of hypoglycaemic seizure that led to withdrawal of the subject from the trial.

Figure 13 Trial 3816 Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – treatment emergent - mean cumulative function (upper panel: 
all subjects; lower panel: age groups) – safety analysis set 
The reporting of confirmed hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups with similar 
proportions reporting an event. In both treatment groups, hypoglycaemias were more common in 
subjects aged 6-11 years which may reflect greater difficulties in controlling blood glucose in this age 
group, i.e. during school hours. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
The majority of subjects , n=170 (93.9%), had no severe hypoglycaemic episodes neither in the 
IDegAsp treatment group nor in the IDet treatment group n=176 (98.3%). In the IDegAsp treatment 
group, 11 subjects (6.1%) reported 14 severe hypoglycaemic episode (Table 24 and Figure 14), 
leading to a rate of 26 episodes per 100 PYE. In the IDet treatment group, 3 subjects (1.7%) reported 
4 severe hypoglycaemic episodes leading to a rate of 7 episodes per 100 PYE. There was no 
statistically significant difference between treatment groups. 
When evaluating severe hypoglycaemic episodes it is important to note that these were mostly single 
occurrences in individual subjects. Three (3) subjects in the IDegAsp treatment group reported 2 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016

severe hypoglycaemic episodes each (1 of these subjects reported the events within 19 minutes and it 
was evaluated to be the same episode by the external classifier; see below) and 1 subject in the IDet 
treatment group reported 2 severe episodes. Two (2) of the episodes in the IDegAsp group and 1 in 
the IDet group appeared to be related to exercise. The observed rate of severe hypoglycaemic 
episodes was higher with IDegAsp than with IDet throughout the trial. The majority of the severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during daytime (diurnal) in both treatment groups.

Figure 14 Trial 3816 Distribution of severe hypoglycaemic episodes - subject counts against 
number of episodes - safety analysis set 
The episodes of severe hypoglycaemia according to ADA and ISPAD were reviewed by an external 
expert in a blinded manner in order to have a centralised assessment of severe hypoglycaemia 
classification, in accordance with ISPAD. The classification was based on case narratives and 
paraclinical findings. Under the external classification, 7 events (in 6 subjects) in IDegAsp treatment 
group were classified as severe based on the most subjective criterion ‘altered mental status and 
cannot assist in his care’; no events in the IDet treatment group met this criterion. Additionally, 6 
events (in 5 subjects) in the IDegAsp treatment group and 4 events (in 3 subjects) in the IDet 
treatment group involved the child being semiconscious or unconscious, or in a coma ± convulsions 
(Table 24).

subjects; lower panel: age groups) – safety analysis set 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes across age groups 
In the IDegAsp treated group, the number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was similar between age 
groups; 5 episodes in 4 subjects were reported in children 1-5 years and in adolescents 12-17 years 
while 4 episodes in 3 subjects were reported in children 6-11 years (Figure 15). The rate for children 
1-5 years was higher compared to other age groups, although it should be noted that the rates are 
based on few episodes. 
In the IDet treated group, two (2) episodes in 2 subjects were reported in children 1-5 years and 2 
episodes in 1 subject were reported in adolescents 12-17 years. No episodes were reported in children 
6-11 years .

The Applicant has presented data on severe hypoglycaemias in the lowest age group of children 2-5 
year. There is a signal of a potential higher risk for severe hypoglyacemic event but this signal is based 
on few events in few individuals and should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the 
hypoglycaemias were seen mostly during daytime and the overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias did 
not differ between treatments. Notably, a lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias was observed in the 
youngest age group treated with IDegAsp. Even though a premixed insulin probably not is a suitable 
treatment for the majority of young children there may be clinical situations where a premixed insulin 
may offer advantages for a young child for example may be suitable for some children, for example in 
cases of poor compliance and with the need for fewer injections.   
During the procedure the  children aged 1 to <2 years in the were excluded from the indication 
because of for example, small doses of insulin, variable feeding patterns and activity levels and 
inability of communicating symptoms of hypoglycaemia.  
In the IDegAsp treatment group, 5 subjects reported 5 SAEs, severe hypoglycaemia, considered 
possibly or probably related to IDegAsp. 
In the IDet treatment group, 1subject reported 1 SAE (‘loss of consciousness’) considered possibly 
related to IAsp. 
One case with a mix-up between basal and bolus insulin was found.  
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
The percentages of subjects experiencing nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were similar 
with IDegAsp (N= 101 [55.8%]) and IDet (N= 106 [59.2%]) as was the observed rates per 100 PYE 
(577 with IDegAsp and 540 with IDet). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 
treatment arms (IDegAsp OD/IDet: 1.09 [0.81; 1.48] 95% CI). Approximately 90% of the subjects in 
both treatment groups reported 4 or fewer nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during the 
trial. 
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes across age groups 
The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes tended to increase with increasing age. Thus, 
the rate was higher in adolescents 12-17 years as compared to the overall trial population and lower in 
children 1 to 5 years. The higher rate in adolescents may be attributed to adolescent lifestyle.

The number of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes was low in both treatment groups, which 
precluded meaningful statistical analysis comparison between treatments. 
Two (2) nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes in 1 subject was reported in the IDegAsp treatment 
group (children 6-11 years) and 2 episodes in 2 subjects was reported in the IDet treatment group (1 
subject in children 1-5 years and 1 subject in adolescents 12-17 years).

Figure 16 Trial 3816 Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes – treatment emergent - mean cumulative function 
(upper panel: all subjects; lower panel: age groups) – safety analysis set 
The overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatments. Notably, a lower rate 
of nocturnal hypoglycaemias was observed in the youngest age group treated with IDegAsp.  
Hyperglycaemic episodes and ketosis 
According to the protocol, subjects were to report a hyperglycaemic episode whenever a glucose 
measurement was 14.0 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) or above, and the subject looked/felt ill. Subjects having 
a hyperglycaemic episode as described were to also measure ketone bodies. The ketone measurement 
involved an additional finger prick. Ketosis was considered present if blood ketones were higher than 
1.5 mmol/L. 
The percentages of subjects experiencing hyperglycaemic episodes were similar between IDegAsp (N= 
72 [39.8%]) and IDet (N= 73 [40.8%]) treatment groups (Table 26) The observed rate of 
hyperglycaemic episodes per 100 PYE was 1094 with IDegAsp and 833 with IDet. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 55/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The percentages of subjects experiencing hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis (blood ketones > 1.5 
mmol/L) were numerically lower with IDegAsp (N= 4 [2.2%]) compared to IDet (N= 8 [4.5%]). The 
rate per 100 PYE was 11 with IDegAsp and 22 with IDet. There were no statistically significant 
differences between treatment groups in the rates of hyperglycaemic episodes or hyperglycaemic 
episodes with ketosis. 
In order to assess the hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis in the trial, it has to be considered that 
many subjects did not measure ketone bodies as per protocol. Ketone bodies were measured for 
approximately 74% of hyperglycaemic episodes in the IDegAsp treatment group and for 67% in the 
IDet treatment group. This imbalance in ketone body measurement among groups would be expected 
to result in more ketosis episodes identified in the IDegAsp treatment group. However, less episodes of 
ketosis were reported in the IDegAsp treatment group than in the IDet treatment group (6 episodes in 
4 subjects with IDegAsp versus 12 episodes in 8 subjects with IDet), implying that the difference in 
episodes of ketosis in favour of IDegAsp might have been underestimated. 
Regarding subjects experiencing nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes, the percentages of subjects were 
similar between IDegAsp (N= 26 [14.4%]) compared to the IDet (N= 30 [16.8%]) treatment group. 
The respective rates per 100 PYE were 184 with IDegAsp and 98 with IDet (Table 26). 
Regarding nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis (blood ketones > 1.5 mmol/L), 1 episode in 
1 subject was reported with IDegAsp vs 2 episodes in 2 subjects with IDet ( Table 26). No statistical 
analysis was performed for nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes nor for nocturnal hyperglycaemic 
episodes with ketosis.

In conclusion, the proportion of subjects reporting hyperglycaemias did not differ between treatment 
groups, but more hyperglycaemic events were reported in the IDegAsp treated group. The reporting of 
hyperglycaemia with ketones was low, with fewer reports in the IDegAsp treated group, even though, 
as noted by the MAH, more subjects had actually measured ketones in accordance with the protocol in 
the IDegAsp treated group. Thus, the rate of ketosis in the IDet group may be underestimated. 
Hyperglycaemic episodes across age groups 
In the IDegAsp treated group, children 6-11 years had higher rate per 100 PYE (1751) of 
hyperglycaemic episodes compared to children 1-5 years (817) and adolescents 12-17 years (722). 
The number of hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis was 3 in children 1-5 years, 1 in children 6-11 
years and 2 in adolescents 12-17 years. 
The percentage of subjects with nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes was similar between age groups. 
The number of nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis was very low for all age groups. 
In the IDet treated group, children 1-5 years had a higher rate per 100 PYE (955) of hyperglycaemic 
episodes compared to children 6-11 years (758) and adolescents 12-17 years (827). The number of 
hypoglycaemic episodes with ketosis was 4 in children 1-5 years, 3 in children 6-11 years and 5 in 
adolescents 12-17 years. 
The percentage of subjects with nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes was similar between children 1- 5 
years and children 6-11 years and slightly higher for the adolescents 12-17 years. The number of 
nocturnal hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis was very low for all age groups. 
Vital signs and laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant differences from baseline to end of treatment or between the two treatment 
groups were observed for vital signs or laboratory values. Mean SD score for body weight increased in 
the IDegAsp group from 0.40 at baseline to 0.44 at week 16. No such increase was seen in the IDet 
group, where there was very little change in mean SD score for body weight. Statistical analysis of 
change from baseline in weight SD score showed a statistically significant treatment difference; 
IDegAsp-IDet: 0.07 [0.02; 0.12]95% CI for the change from baseline to week 16. 
2.5.5.  Adverse events of special interest trial 3816 
Medication errors concerning trial products 
Eight (8) events of medication error occurred in 7 subjects in the IDegAsp treatment group (1 
‘overdose’ and 7 ‘wrong drug administered’) and 6 events in 6 subjects in the IDet treatment group (2 
‘accidental overdose’, 1 ‘drug dispensing error’ and 3 ‘wrong drug administered’). All of the ‘wrong 
drug administered’ events were due to mix-up of insulins by the subjects’ carer. In the IDegAsp 
treatment group, 5 out of the 7 ‘wrong drug administered’ events were due to mix-up between the two 
trial products, and 2 events (both in the same subject) were due to mix-up between the trial product 
and the pre-trial insulin. In the IDet treatment group, out of the 3 ‘wrong drug administered’ events, 1 
was due to mix-up between the two trial insulins, and 2 were due to mix-up with the pre-trial insulin 
product. None of the events were reported as SAEs. Most of the events were mild in severity and all 
subjects recovered from the events. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 57/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A review of the SAEs of severe hypoglycaemia revealed one episode that was temporally associated 
with a mix-up between bolus and basal insulin. Investigators were required to report all medication 
errors concerning trial products (both serious and non-serious) as MESIs.  
Allergic reactions 
A total of 9 events of allergic reactions occurred in 6 subjects in the IDegAsp treatment group and 5 
events in 4 subjects in the IDet treatment group leading to rates of 16 vs. 9 events per 100 PYE, 
respectively. This difference was mostly driven by 5 events of ‘hypersensitivity’ in 2 subjects in the 
IDegAsp treatment group vs. no events in the IDet treatment group. All of the events were unlikely 
related to trial product and the dose of trial product did not change because of the events. 
Injection site reactions 
One (1) event of ‘injection site hypertrophy’ was reported in 1 subject with IDegAsp and 3 events of 
injection site reactions ( 2 events of ‘injection site hypertrophy’ and 1 event of ‘injection site swelling’) 
in 3 subjects were reported with IDet. One (1) event was considered possibly or probably related to 
IDegAsp or IDet in each treatment group respectively. Additionally, 1 injection site reaction in each 
treatment group was considered possibly or probably related to IAsp. 
None of the injection site reactions were serious. One (1) event of ‘injection site hypertrophy’ in the 
IDet treatment group was of moderate severity and 3 events were mild in severity. None of the 
subjects withdrew due to injection site reactions. Two events of ‘injection site swelling’ had an outcome 
of not recovered. 
Across age groups, 1 event of ‘injection site hypertrophy’ in the IDet treatment group was reported in 
children 1-5 years, no events were reported in children 6-11 years, and the remaining 3 events were 
reported in adolescents 12-17 years. 
Slightly more allergic reactions were reported in the IDegAsp treated group, however, none of the 
events were considered related to study product and did not result in any discontinuations. Few 
injection site reactions were reported, which were evenly distributed between treatments. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject in the IDegAsp treatment group was withdrawn from the trial due to an AE 
(‘hypoglycaemic seizure’). 
In addition, one subject in the IDet treatment group was withdrawn due to hypoglycaemic events 
judged by the investigator to be related to the trial product.  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
The number of AEs leading to dose reduction of IDegAsp, IDet and/or IAsp was numerically higher with 
IDegAsp compared with IDet (21 events in 15 subjects in the IDegAsp treatment group and 9 events 
in 8 subjects in the IDet treatment group, leading to rates of 38 vs. 17 events per 100 PYE, 
respectively). 
Dose reduction due to AEs was most frequently related to events of infection or because of 
gastrointestinal disorders and events of ‘hypoglycaemia’. In both treatment groups most of the events 
related to dose reduction were reported in the SOC Infections and infestations (6 events in 5 subjects 
with IDegAsp and 6 events in 6 subjects with IDet, respectively). Insulin adjustments are normally 
required in connection with infections. The infections themselves may result in a need for higher insulin

doses but the associated symptoms, such as vomiting, decreased appetite and diarrhoea, may cause a 
need for reducing the dose. Five (5) hypoglycaemia related AEs led to dose reductions in the IDegAsp 
treatment group compared to 0 events in the IDet treatment group. 
Among the AEs leading to dose reduction, 5 subjects reported 5 AEs that were considered possibly or 
probably related to IDegAsp (3 cases of ‘hypoglycaemia’, 1 ‘wrong drug administered’ and 1 
‘overdose’) and 1 subject reported 1 AE that was considered probably related to IDet (‘accidental 
overdose’). The AEs considered probably or possibly related to IAsp were 2 events in 2 subjects in the 
IDegAsp treatment group and no events in the IDet group. In the IDegAsp treatment group 1 event 
that led to an IDegAsp dose reduction (‘hypoglycaemia’) was related to both IDegAsp and IAsp. 
Adverse events leading to temporary withdrawal of trial product 
In total, 3 subjects (0.8%) had 3 AEs leading to temporary withdrawal of trial product; 2 subjects 
(1.1%) in the IDegAsp treatment group and 1 subject (0.6%) in the IDet treatment group. The events 
were ‘gastroenteritis’, ‘wrong drug administered’ and ‘fall’, respectively. 
All three events were considered unlikely related to trial product and all three subjects recovered or 
were recovering. The events ‘gastroenteritis’ and ‘wrong drug administered’ occurred in the IDegAsp 
treatment group and ‘fall’ occurred in the IDet group.  
No deaths occurred during the study. 
The most common reason for withdrawal or dose reduction was hypoglycaemia. 
2.5.6.  Clinical safety Supportive trial 3561 
Overview of adverse events  
The proportion of subjects reporting TEAEs as well as the rate of AEs were comparable in the IDeg and 
the IDet treatment arms see Table 27. The majority of AEs in both treatment arms were of mild or 
moderate severity and considered unrelated to basal insulin. No subjects died during the trial, and the 
rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in the two treatment groups. 
Approximately 97% of all AEs in either treatment arm had an outcome of recovered at end of trial. A 
total of 3 subjects were withdrawn from the trial due to AEs, all in the IDet treatment arm. 
Patient exposure 
In total, 174 subjects were exposed to IDeg and 175 subjects were exposed to IDet. The total 
exposure was higher in the IDeg arm (161.5 years) than in the IDet arm (147.4 years) and in both 
treatment arms, the mean exposure for an individual subject was close to 1 year. The mean exposure 
was comparable between the two treatment groups during the main trial period (first 26 weeks), but 
higher in the IDeg arm than in the IDet arm during the last 26 weeks, reflecting the higher proportion 
of subjects continuing on IDeg compared to IDet in the extension phase of the trial. Males had a higher 
total exposure than females (175.3 vs. 133.5 years, respectively) reflecting the higher proportion of 
males to females exposed to trial products in both treatment arms. The total exposure was distributed 
similarly across the 3 age groups in the two treatment arms. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 59/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Deaths and other serious adverse events 
No deaths were reported in this trial. The observed rates of SAEs were similar for IDeg and IDet, both 
overall, across severity and causality categories, and with respect to recovery. Most of the SAEs were 
considered unlikely related to trial products and with an outcome of ‘recovered’ at end of trial). The 
low number of SAEs should be taken into consideration when evaluating the observed rates between 
treatment groups as these comparisons are based on a low number of subjects with few events. 
The majority of the SAEs were related to infections, hypoglycaemia, and hyperglycaemia in both 
treatment arms and no SAEs were reported by more than 5% of subjects, see Table 27. The rates of 
SAEs were similar in the SAS and the ETS. Few of the hypoglycaemic events in both treatment arms 
were associated with seizure (1 episode with IDeg and 4 episodes with IDet) or unconsciousness (1 
episode in each treatment arm). It should be noted that a total of 5 AEs related to hypoglycaemic 
seizure or hypoglycaemic unconsciousness (2 episodes with IDeg and 3 episodes with IDet) were 
regarded as non-serious by the investigators but as serious by the applicant. As the clinical database 
reflects the investigator reported data, these events were included as non-serious AEs in the clinical 
database (tables and listings), but are included as SAEs in the narratives from the safety database.

Hypoglycaemia 
Definitions of hypoglycaemia  
Classification of hypoglycaemia was performed in accordance with the definitions of hypoglycaemic 
episodes from the ISPAD guidelines, which are in line with the principles underlying the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) classification. Furthermore, hypoglycaemia was defined according to the 
applicant’s definition of ‘confirmed hypoglycaemia’. In normal physiology, hypoglycaemia symptoms 
occur at a PG level of approximately < 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), and the applicant has therefore used 
this cut-off value to define ‘confirmed hypoglycaemia’. Hypoglycaemic episodes with time of onset in

the period 23:00-07:00 (both included) were considered nocturnal. In the following sections, 
hypoglycaemia will be described based on severe hypoglycaemia as well as confirmed hypoglycaemia.  
Severe hypoglycaemia – definition  
Severe hypoglycaemia: The child has altered mental status and cannot assist in his own care, is 
semiconscious or unconscious, or in coma ± convulsions and may require parenteral therapy (glucagon 
or i.v. glucose). 
Confirmed hypoglycaemia – definition 
•  An episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia with confirmation by PG <3.1 
mmol/L (56 mg/dL), or full blood glucose < 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) and which does not fulfil 
the requirements for being classified as a severe hypoglycaemic episode, 
•  Or any asymptomatic PG value < 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or full blood glucose value <2.8 
mmol/L (50 mg/dL).  
•  Or severe hypoglycaemia (according to the ISPAD classification see Figure 3) 
Confirmed hypoglycaemia 
Almost all subjects in the trial experienced confirmed hypoglycaemia (98% of subjects treated with 
IDeg and and 96% treated with IDet), and the observed rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was 5771 
and 5405 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg and IDet treatment arms, respectively. There was no 
statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia 
(rate ratio IDeg/IDet: 1.11 [0.89; 1.38] 95% CI). A post-hoc analysis of confirmed hypoglycaemia 
during the maintenance period from 16 weeks of treatment to end of trial led to a similar result (rate 
ratio IDeg/IDet: 1.05[0.83; 1.32]95%CI), and a post-hoc sensitivity analysis showed that the number 
of days without confirmed hypoglycaemia was similar with IDeg and IDet treatment (rate ratio 
IDeg/IDet: 0.99[0.96;1.02]95%CI).

Figure 18 Trial 3561 Distribution of severe hypoglycaemic episodes - subject counts against number of episodes - safety 
analysis set 
The observed rate of severe hypoglycaemic episodes tended to be higher with IDeg than IDet, 
especially during the first 4 weeks of treatment. It should be kept in mind that based on the external 
classification; the observed rates of severe hypoglycaemia were lower in both treatment groups than 
based on all reported severe hypoglycaemic episodes. The majority of the severe hypoglycaemic 
episodes (close to 80%) occurred during the daytime in both treatment arms.

(upper panel) and by treatment and age group (lower panel) – safety analysis set 
The higher observed rate in the IDeg arm during the initial 4 weeks of treatment may reflect that the 
initial weeks of treatment may be associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia related to 
switching to a new insulin product or regimen. In contrast, almost 50% of the subjects in the IDet arm 
used IDet prior to entering the trial and were familiar with this insulin product. The rate of severe 
hypoglycaemia differed between the age groups in the IDeg arm, and the higher observed rate of 
severe hypoglycaemia with IDeg during the last weeks of treatment was primarily driven by children 
aged 6-11 years. In both treatment groups, children aged 6-11 years also had the highest rate of 
confirmed hypoglycaemia. Children in this age group go to school and many participate in various 
physical activities. Thus, it may be particularly challenging to ensure that the insulin dose matches 
food intake and physical activity, and adult assistance may not be available.

Nocturnal hypoglycaemia Trial 3561 
The proportions of subjects with nocturnal hypoglycaemia were similar with IDeg and IDet, while the 
observed rate of nocturnal confirmed episodes was numerically lower with IDeg compared to IDet, 
(603 and 760 episodes per 100 PYE, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference 
between treatment arms (IDeg/IDet: 0.99 [0.72; 1.34]95%CI).The observed rate of nocturnal confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes appeared to be lower with IDeg than IDet during the maintenance period of 
the trial from 16 weeks of treatment to end of trial. However, there was no statistically significant 
difference between the treatments in the post-hoc analysis of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic 
episodes during the maintenance period (rate ratio IDeg/IDet: 0.88 [0.63; 1.23]95%CI). As seen for all 
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes, the observed rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia differed 
between the age groups in the IDet arm, which was related to a low observed rate in children aged 1-5 
years and to a high observed rate in adolescents. 
Hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia with ketosis trial 3561 
In Trial 3561, the threshold for defining hyperglycaemia was 11.1 mmol/L and subjects with an SMPG 
> 14 mmol/L (250mg/dL) were to measure blood ketones regardless of symptoms. There were no 
statistically significant differences between treatment arms in the rate of hyperglycaemic episodes or in 
the rate of nocturnal (23:00 –07:00, both included) hyperglycaemic episodes; rate ratio IDeg/IDet: 
0.97 [0.84; 1.13]95%CI and 1.17 [0.92;1.49.]95%CI, respectively. In contrast, the rate of 
hyperglycaemia with ketosis was statistically significantly lower in the IDeg arm compared to the IDet 
arm (rate ratio IDeg/IDet: 0.41 [0.22; 0.78]95%CI), and the rate of nocturnal episodes of 
hyperglycaemia with ketosis was numerically lower with IDeg than IDet (10 vs. 18 episodes per 100 
PYE) with no statistical analysis being performed due to the small number of episodes. The lower rate 
of hyperglycaemia with ketosis with IDeg was consistent with the numerically lower rate of ‘blood 
ketone body increased’ reported as TEAEs in the IDeg arm than in the IDet arm, and it appeared to be 
driven by a lower observed rate with IDeg compared to IDet across all age groups. In both treatment 
arms, the observed rate of hyperglycaemia appeared to be higher in children aged 1-5 years and 6-11 
years than in adolescents, whereas the observed rate of hyperglycaemia with ketosis was markedly 
higher in small children aged 1-5 years compared to the two older age groups. This may possibly be 
related to the higher rates of infections and infestations observed in the youngest age group. 
Post marketing experience 
IDegAsp-Ryzodeg - children, adolescents and adults  
As of 1 June 2015, Ryzodeg (IDegAsp) had been marketed for use in adults in 6 countries, and the 
estimated cumulative exposure was 8,173 PYEs based on the assumption of an average daily 
consumption of 40 units. Cumulatively, a total of 30 ADR reports had been received by the MAH from 
post-marketing use of Ryzodeg, describing a total of 64 ADRs. In about half of the ADR reports, the 
subjects experienced more than one ADR, thereby contributing to the total number of 64 ADRs. Most 
of the ADR reports concerned adults; 6 of the reports were related to use in children and adolescents, 
all reported from Mexico. In 5 of the 6 reports in paediatric subjects no ADR was reported, only the 
fact the product had been administered to a child (Ryzodeg is not approved for children in Mexico and 
therefore the use of the product in this sub-population is considered off label use; reports concerning 
‘off-label use’ are handled as ADRs). The last report related to use in children concerned a non-serious 
case of blood glucose abnormal. All 64 ADRs were non-serious, except 1 serious event of 
hypoglycaemia in a 30-year old female; the event was considered due to exercise and lack of food 
intake. The most frequently reported ADRs in adults were related to hyperglycaemia/increased blood 
glucose (10 events), injection site reactions (10 events), medication errors (10 events) and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 66/85 
 
 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia (4 events). The ADRs reported for Ryzodeg in the post-marketed setting resemble the 
AEs reported in clinical trials with IDegAsp in adults, although the rates of the reported events post-
marketing were, as expected, lower than those reported in the clinical trials. Based on the estimated 
exposure from marketed use (8,173 PYEs) the rates of hyperglycaemia/ increased blood glucose, 
injection site reactions and medication errors were 0.12 events per 100 PYE while the rate of 
hypoglycaemia was 0.05 events per 100 PYE (3 of the 4 events of hypoglycaemia were reported as 
severe). In therapeutic confirmatory trials with IDegAsp in adults with T1DM or T2DM the 
corresponding rates for hyperglycaemia, injection site reactions, medication errors and severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes were 1.6, 5.1, 5.2 and 26.6 events per 100 PYE, respectively  
The bias introduced by under-reporting or differential reporting of events is a known issue related to 
post-marketing ADR reporting. Based on an evaluation of the ADR cases no concerns were raised.  
IDeg-Tresiba - children and adolescents  
Information on post-marketing data of IDeg, the basal component of IDegAsp, is considered of value 
to support the paediatric variation for IDegAsp. IDeg has been approved for the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus in adults in more than 60 countries, including the EU and Japan. The use of IDeg in 
adolescents and children from the age of 1 year was approved in the EU in January 2015. As of 4 July 
2015, the overall estimated exposure to IDeg was 258,075 PYE, based on the assumption of an 
average daily consumption of 40 units. 
As of 1 June 2015, a total of 111 ADR reports had been received by the MAH from postmarketing use 
in children and adolescents using Tresiba. Most of the ADRs were reported from Brazil, Japan, UK and 
Mexico. Of the 111 ADR reports, only 51 reports were associated with ADRs (78 events); the 
remaining 60 reports concerned off-label use with no ADR reported. The majority of the ADRs (49 of 
the 78 events) occurred in adolescents (aged 12−17 years) while 24 of the events were reported in 
children aged 6−11 years and 5 events were reported in younger children aged 1−5 years. 
Approximately 30% of the events were serious (24 of 78 events). Half of the serious ADRs were 
related to events of hypoglycaemia (12 events); in addition, 4 events of diabetic ketoacidosis were 
reported. For the remaining serious cases there was no pattern in the reported ADRs. The most 
frequently reported non-serious ADRs were related to hypoglycaemia (14 events), hyperglycaemia/ 
increased blood glucose (11 events) and injection site reactions/lipodystrophy (6 events). The ADRs 
reported for Tresiba in the post-marketing setting resemble the AEs that were reported in the 
paediatric trial for IDeg (Trial 3561).  
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial 3816 
The overall reporting of adverse events were somewhat higher in the IDegAsp treated group, however, 
the rate of events deemed to be related to treatment was low and comparable between groups. Apart 
from hypoglycaemia, the most commonly reported events appears to be related to infectious diseases 
as could be expected in this age group. There were no apparent imbalances in the reporting of events 
by SOC or preferred terms. 
Serious adverse events were few and the most commonly reported event was hypoglycaemia. A 
hypoglycaemia related event was also the reason for withdrawal of one subject in the IDegAsp treated 
group. Hypoglycaemia was also the most common reason for dose reductions.

Medication errors due to mix-up between trial products and pre-trial products were reported to be 
equal in both treatment groups. A review of the SAEs of severe hypoglycaemia revealed one episode 
that was temporally associated with a mix-up between bolus and basal insulin.  
Slightly more allergic reactions were reported in the IDegAsp treated group, however, none of the 
events were considered related to study product and did not result in any discontinuations. Few 
injection site reactions were reported, which were evenly distributed between treatments. 
Hypoglycaemia was only to be reported as an AE if it fulfilled the definition of a SAE or a severe 
hypoglycaemia as per ISPAD definition. The reporting of hypoglycaemia as AE was higher for IDegAsp 
than for IDet (6.1 % vs 1.7 %). 
The reporting of confirmed hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups with similar 
proportions reporting an event. In both treatment groups, hypoglycaemias were more common in 
subjects aged 6-11 years which may reflect greater difficulties in controlling blood glucose in this age 
group, i.e. during school hours. 
Severe hypoglycaemias were rare but more often reported in the IDegAsp treated group. Importantly 
most of the events occurred in daytime. The number of episodes per subjects was highest in the age 
group 1-5 years treated with IDegAsp. This finding is in contrast to the findings in trial 3561, where 
this age group showed the lowest rate of severe hypoglycaemias during the first 16 weeks of the 
study. The Applicant has presented data on severe hypoglycaemias in the lowest age group of children 
2-5 year (n=40). There is a signal of a potential higher risk for severe hypoglycaemic event but this 
signal is based on few events in few individuals and should be interpreted with caution. 
The Applicant has given a detailed description of the severe hypoglycaemias in the IDegIAsp treatment 
group with children 2-5 years old. There is no clear pattern when these hypoglycaemias occur in 
relation to dosing time at day or treatments start of the study drug even though the events with 
severe hypoglycaemia occurred within the first two months of treatment. Therefore it is reasonable to 
believe that the severe hypoglycaemias in this age group found in Trial 3816 are related to the 
challenges treating T1DM in small children, and not to IDegIAsp treatment per se. Even though a 
premixed insulin probably not is a suitable treatment for the majority of young children because 
assessment of hypoglycaemia may be more difficult as young children may have difficulties in 
communicating symptoms and  there may be a need for more frequent adjustment of the bolus dose in 
the youngest age group as the young child may be less predictable in when accepting a meal or not, 
However, there may be clinical situations where a premixed insulin may offer advantages for a young 
child, for example in cases of poor compliance and with the need for fewer injections. 
In addition, the hypoglycaemias were seen during daytime and the overall rate of nocturnal 
hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatments. Notably, a lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias 
was observed in the youngest age group treated with IDegAsp.  
Furthermore, during the procedure the Applicant has suggested to exclude children aged 1 to <2 years 
in the proposed indication. This is endorsed because of the reasons given i.e small doses of insulin, 
variable feeding patterns and activity levels and inability of communicating symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia.   
The risk of medication errors as a contributing factor has been discussed and the rate of medication 
errors was low. A review of the SAEs of severe hypoglycaemia revealed one episode that was 
temporally associated with a mix-up between bolus and basal insulin. 
IDegAsp was to be administered in connection to a main meal without further specification. The 
Applicant has presented data by age group on hypoglycaemia pattern with relation to the the main 
meal chosen for administration of Ryzodeg (i.e. with breakfast, lunch or dinner) presented.  No clear-

Page 68/85 
 
 
 
 
cut pattern was seen. Since the insulin regime in the individual patient always has to be adjusted 
according to blood glucose level, timing for meals and physical activity this is not surprising.  
The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups andtended to 
increase with increasing age. Thus, the rate was higher in adolescents 12-17 years as compared to the 
overall trial population and lower in children 1 to 5 years. The higher rate in adolescents may be 
attributed to adolescent lifestyle and was seen with both treatments but more pronounced in the IDet 
treated group. In the IDegIAsp treated group the rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias was lowest in the 
youngest age group, but at the same level as in the IDeg treated group. 
Only a few severe nocturnal hypoglycaemias (n=4) were reported which were evenly distributed 
between groups. Notably, no severe nocturnal hypoglycaemias were observed in the youngest age 
group in the IDeg Asp treated group. 
The proportion of subjects reporting hyperglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups, but 
more hyperglycaemic events were reported in the IDegAsp treated group. This difference was, 
however, not statistically significant. The reporting of hyperglycaemia with ketones was low, with fewer 
reports in the IDegAsp treated group. However, as noted by the MAH, more subjects had actually 
measured ketones in accordance with the protocol in the IDegAsp treated group, thus the rate of 
ketosis in the IDet group may be underestimated. In the IDegAsp treated group, the highest rate of 
hyperglycaemias was observed in the age group 6-11 years, whereas in the IDet treated group the 
highest rate was observed in the age group 1-5 years.  
There were no clinically relevant differences observed with regards to vital signs or laboratory values 
during the study. Mean body weight increased in the IDegAsp treated group, whereas no change was 
observed in the IDet treated group. This may be related to increased appetite after hypoglycaemic 
events. 
Trial 3561 
In terms of safety, no differences overall were observed between IDeg and IDet in terms of TEAEs and 
the rate of AEs. However, injection site reactions were more frequently reported in the IDeg treatment 
arm than in the IDet arm (28 events and 17.3 events per 100 PYE with IDeg versus 7 events and 4.7 
events per 100 PYE). Altogether 8 subjects reported 12 events which were considered to be possibly or 
probably related to basal insulin in the IDeg group and 5 subjects reported 6 events in the IDet group. 
As noted the most obvious reason for this difference is related to the open-label design, i.e. subjects in 
the IDet group had to have tolerated pre-trial treatment with IDet and subjects in the IDeg group 
might be more attentive to adverse reactions. Importantly the frequency of the of injection site 
reactions that were assessed possibly or probably related to IDeg was comparable to the frequency in 
adults. The MAH monitors injection site reactions from the paediatric population through the routine 
pharmacovigilance, which is considered adequate. 
There was a higher rate of observed severe hypoglycaemia in the IDeg arm compared to the IDet arm. 
The overall number of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia was higher in the IDeg group than the IDet 
group and this difference was primarily driven by children aged 6-11 years. The MAH argued that the 
number of subjects within each age group reporting severe hypoglycaemia was low and too small to 
conclude upon. This was solved by a wording in the SmPC for Tresiba in section 5.1. The proportions of 
subjects with nocturnal hypoglycaemia were similar with IDeg and IDet and there was no significant 
difference in the observed rate of nocturnal confirmed episodes between treatment groups although 
the rate per 100 PY was lower for IDeg than for IDet (603 and 760 episodes per 100 PYE, 
respectively). The findings are largely in line with those observed in adult patients with T1DM.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 69/85 
 
 
 
 
In contrast the rate of hyperglycaemia with ketosis was significantly lower in the IDeg arm compared 
to the IDet arm.  
Insulin antibodies cross-reacting between IDeg or IDet and human insulin decreased slightly with IDeg 
and increased slightly with IDet, but there was no correlation between cross-reacting antibodies and 
estimates of glycaemic control. Regarding insulin-specific antibodies the levels were low although 
slightly higher with IDet than IDeg. Again no correlation between these antibodies and glycaemic 
parameters were observed. 
2.5.8.  Conclusions on paediatric data on clinical safety 
No unexpected safety concerns have arisen in the main trial 3816 in which IDegAsp was evaluated in 
the paediatric age group. The overall reporting of adverse events were somewhat higher in the 
IDegAsp treated group, however, the rate of events deemed to be related to treatment was low and 
comparable between groups. 
Serious adverse events were few and the most commonly reported event was hypoglycaemia. A 
hypoglycaemia related event was also the reason for withdrawal of one subject in the IDegAsp treated 
group. Hypoglycaemia was also the most common reason for dose reductions. 
The reporting of confirmed hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups with similar 
proportions reporting an event. In both treatment groups, hypoglycaemias were more common in 
subjects aged 6-11 years which may reflect greater difficulties in controlling blood glucose in this age 
range. 
The reporting of severe hypoglycaemia was higher for IDegAsp than for IDet (6.1 % vs 1.7 %). Severe 
hypoglycaemias were most common in the youngest age group which may reflect a greater need for 
adjustment of the bolus dose as, for example, the young child may be less predictable in when 
accepting a meal or not. There was no clear pattern when these hypoglycaemias occurred in relation to 
dosing time at day or treatments start, therefore it is reasonable to believe that the severe 
hypoglycaemias in this age group are related to the challenges treating T1DM in small children, and 
not to IDegIAsp treatment per se. In addition,  a small percentage (5-6%) of the children below the 
age of six were already treated with a premixed insulin before inclusion in trial 3816 which suggests 
that there may be a medical need for a premixed insulin for some young children. In conclusion, a 
premixed insulin is probably not a a suitable treatment for the majority of young children but there 
may be clinical situations where a premixed insulin may offer advantages for a young child, for 
example in cases of poor compliance and with the need for fewer injections. 
Notably, in the supportive trial 3561, severe hypoglycaemias were very rare in the youngest age group 
whereas more severe hypoglycaemic events in the 6-11 years age group were found with IDeg 
compared to IDet. More frequent injection site reactions were found with IDeg compared to IDet which 
is reflected in the SmPC for IDeg (Tresiba). Both insulin products provided a beneficial efficacious 
treatment with acceptable safety profiles.  
The concerns of treating young children with Ryzodeg are thoroughly described in the SmPC in section 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8. A more detailed study description is made in section 5.1. 
2.5.9.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update:  
• 
• 
“Regarding the category 4 studies, there is no need to list those in the RMP, and the document 
could be updated by removing these studies”; 
The text for the routine risk minimisation section of the RMP (in the summary table of risk 
minimisation measures, section V.3) which relates to the waiver in the paediatric population 
should be revised, in line with the latest agreed wording in SmPC section 5.1 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 5 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new proposed indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
have been updated. Particularly, a new warning in 4.4 with regard to Ryzodeg has been added to the 
product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s). 
The major changes are listed below. For the complete changes see attached PI.

established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Ryzodeg can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 2 years (see section 5.1). When 
changing from another insulin regimen to Ryzodeg, dose reduction of total insulin needs to be 
considered on an individual basis, in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).  
Ryzodeg should be used with special caution in children 2 to 5 years old because data from the clinical 
trial indicate that there may be a higher risk for severe hypoglycaemia in children in this age group 
(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see 
sections 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9). 
In children, extra care should be taken to match insulin doses with food intake and physical activities 
in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Ryzodeg may be associated with higher occurrence of 
severe hypoglycaemia compared to a basal-bolus regimen in paediatric population, particularly in 
children 2 to 5 years old (see section 5.1). For this age group, Ryzodeg should be considered on an 
individual basis. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
. . . 
Paediatric population 
Ryzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation 
of pharmacokinetic properties (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a trial 
in children aged 2 to less than 18 years. The frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the 
paediatric population do not indicate differences to the experience in the general diabetes population 
with the exception of a signal of higher occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia compared to a basal-bolus 
regimen in paediatric population, particularly in children 2 to 5 years old (see section 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1).  
Safety and efficacy have not been investigated in children and adolescents. 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
. . . 
Paediatric population 
. . . 
The efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg has been studied in a randomised controlled clinical trial in children 
and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 for a period of 16 weeks (n=362). Patients in the 
Ryzodeg arm included 40 exposed children aged 2-5 years, 61 children aged 6-11 years and 80 
adolescents aged 12-17 years. Ryzodeg dosed once daily with the main meal plus insulin aspart for the 
remaining meals showed similar reduction in HbA1c at week 16 and no differences in FPG and SMPG 
compared to comparator insulin detemir dosed once or twice daily plus mealtime insulin aspart. At 
week 16, the mean total daily insulin dose was 0.88 vs. 1.01 units/kg in the Ryzodeg and insulin 
detemir arms, respectively. The rates (events per patient-year of exposure) of confirmed 
hypoglycaemia (ISPAD 2009 definition: 46.23 vs 49.55) and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (5.77 
vs 5.40) were comparable with Ryzodeg versus insulin detemir whereas the rate of severe 
hypoglycaemia (0.26 vs 0.07) was higher in the Ryzodeg arm although the difference was not 
statistically significant. Few severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in each group; the observed 
rate of severe hypoglycaemia within the Ryzodeg arm was higher for subjects aged 2-5 years 
compared to subjects aged 6-11 years or 12-17 years (0.42 vs 0.21 and 0.21 respectively). Efficacy

and safety evaluation for adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has been made using data 
from adolescent and adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adult patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. This assessment supports the use of Ryzodeg in adolescent patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable  for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
the changes to the patient leaflet are not significant (ref. Guideline on the readability of the 
labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use, January 2009) 
a user consultation was recently made for the degludec family during the marketing 
authorization application approved in January 2013 (ref. Summary of Readability and Bridging 
Strategy for the Degludec family of leaflets, September 2011, eCTD seq. 0000)  
the proposed wording is similar to the wording for Levemir (insulin detemir, Novo Nordisk) 
which was user tested in May 2011 (ref. Levemir InnoLet, Levemir FlexPen, Levemir FlexTouch 
and Levemir Penfill)  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Mixed insulin containing insulins with different pharmacokinetic profiles (basal and bolus insulin) have 
been available for many years but have mostly been used in T2 DM in adults. There is one mixed 
insulin (InsAsp/InsAsp protamine) approved from 10 years of age. Although currently the ISPAD 
guideline does not recommend the use of premixed insulins in the paediatric population, the guidelines 
acknowledge that premixed insulins may be useful to reduce the number of injections to improve 
compliance and/or adherence to the regimen, especially in prepubertal children. 
Beneficial effects 
The MAH has submitted data from the 16 week therapeutic confirmatory Trial 3816 to support an 
indication for IDegAsp (Ryzodeg) in T1DM in children and adolescents from the age of 1 to 18 years. 
Ryzodeg is approved in the adult population since January 2013. 
Trial 3816 was a 16-week multi-national, multi-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, 
randomised, treat-to-target, efficacy and safety trial in children and adolescents with T1DM between 1 
and 18 years of age. The comparator was IDet (Levemir). 
In the IDegAsp arm there were 40 children aged 2-5 years, 61 children aged 6-11 years and 80 
adolescents aged 12-17 years. There was no child below the age of 2 in the IDegAsp arm. One child 
<2 years was included in the IDet treated group.  
Both treatments resulted in a reduction of HbA1c compared to baseline (-0.27 % vs -0.23 % for 
IDegAsp and IDet, respectively) and non-inferiority was demonstrated. The upper limit of the CI was 
0.15 % which is well within both the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.4 % and the currently 
recommended non-inferiority margin of 0.3 %. A similar trend for HbA1c reduction was observed in all 
age groups irrespective of treatment. Sensitivity analyses were all in line with the primary analysis, 
thus the outcome appears robust. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 76/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The outcome of the secondary endpoints was in line with the primary endpoint. No statistically 
significant differences were observed between treatments. 
The total insulin dose throughout the study was slightly lower in the IDegAsp treated group compared 
to the IDet treated group. This was due to a lower basal insulin dose in the IDegAsp treated group. 
The bolus doses were comparable between groups. In both treatment groups, as expected, the highest 
dose per body weight was observed in the age group 12-17 years. In the IDet treatment arm 54.2 % 
of patients were using IDet BID. 
The Applicant has presented data that points to that a lower number of injections is needed in the 
IDegAsp group compared to the IDet+IAsp group. This may be advantageous to improve compliance 
and/or adherence, as acknowledged in current guidelines (ISPAD; International Society for Paediatric 
and Adolescent Diabetes), particularly  in some clinical situations in the paediatric setting, for example 
during school time. 
Results from the supportive study, trial 3561, have shown that IDeg OD+ bolus IAsp is non inferior to 
IDet OD or BID+ bolus IAsp.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The number of patients in the youngest age group (2-5 years of age) was small. There is, however, no 
reason to believe that the effect in that age group would be different from that in the entire group.. 
The requirements with regards to recruitment set out in the PIP have been fulfilled.  
Risks and unfavourable effects 
The overall reporting of adverse events in study 3816 were somewhat higher in the IDegAsp treated 
group, however, the rate of events deemed to be related to treatment was low and comparable 
between groups. 
Serious adverse events were few and the most commonly reported event was hypoglycaemia. The 
reporting of confirmed hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups with similar 
proportions reporting an event. In both treatment groups, hypoglycaemias were more common in 
subjects aged 6-11 years.  
Confirmed hypoglycaemia 
Almost all subjects in the trial experienced episodes of confirmed hypoglycaemia (98% of subjects 
treated with IDeg and 96% treated with IDet), and the observed rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was 
5771 and 5405 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg and IDet treatment arms, respectively. There was no 
difference between the treatment arms in the rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia (rate ratio IDeg/IDet: 
1.11 [0.89; 1.38]95%CI).  
Although few events, the reporting of severe hypoglycaemia was higher for IDegAsp than for IDet (6.1 
% vs 1.7 %).  
For children aged 2−5 years, the observed rates of severe hypoglycaemia were 42 vs. 16 episodes per 
100 PYE in the IDegAsp and IDet groups, respectively (5 events in 4 subjects in the IDegAsp group vs. 
2 events in 2 subjects in the IDet group). 
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
The percentages of subjects experiencing nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were similar 
with IDegAsp (N= 101 [55.8%]) and IDet (N= 106 [59.2%]) as was the observed rates per 100 PYE 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/486455/2016  
Page 77/85 
 
 
 
 
 
(577 with IDegAsp and 540 with IDet). No difference was observed between the treatment arms 
(IDegAsp OD/IDet: 1.09 [0.81; 1.48]95%CI). Approximately 90% of the subjects in both treatment 
groups reported 4 or fewer nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during the trial. 
Hyperglycaemia 
The proportion of subjects reporting hyperglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups. The 
reporting of hyperglycaemia with ketones was low. In the IDegAsp treated group, the highest rate of 
hyperglycaemias was observed in the age group 6-11 years, whereas in the IDet treated group the 
highest rate was observed in the age group 1-5 years.  
The frequency of injection site reactions was low. 
In the supportive trial 3561 more frequent injection sites reactions and more severe hypoglycaemic 
events in the 6-11 years age group was found with IDeg compared to IDet. This is reflected in the 
SmPC for Tresiba.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects  
The data indicates that there may be a higher risk for severe hypoglycaemia in children below the age 
of 6 years. This is described in the relevant sections of the SmPC.  
The Applicant has presented data concerning the cases with severe hypoglycaemia. One case with a 
mix-up between basal and bolus insulin was found.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Discussion on the importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Study 3816 was an adequately designed study in subjects with T1DM, aged 1-18 years. The data 
shows that IDegAsp OD+ IAsp for the remaining meals is non-inferior to IDet OD or BID+ bolus IAsp 
with respect to lowering of HbA1c. The supportive study trial 3561 has shown that IDeg OD+ bolus 
IAsp is non inferior to IDet OD or BID+ bolus IAsp. These two confirmatory therapeutic studies include 
697 patients which are considered to be sufficient amount of data. Therefore, the studies demonstrate 
the efficacy and support the indication for Ryzodeg. 
The overall safety profile of IDegAsp appears comparable to that of IDet in this population and no new 
safety concerns arise from the data submitted. Hypoglycaemias were seen mostly during daytime and 
the overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemias did not differ between treatment groups. A lower rate of 
nocturnal hypoglycaemias was observed in the youngest age group treated with IDegAsp.  However, 
there was a slightly higher number of severe hypoglycaemia in the IDegAsp treatment group, with the 
finding being more pronounced in the youngest age group (below the age of 6). However, this finding 
with respect to increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia is based on few events in few individuals and 
therefore needs to be interpreted with caution. To address this, additional text for the sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.1 of the SmPC, which state that Ryzodeg should be considered on an individual basis particularly 
in children aged 2-5 years old because there may be a higher risk for severe hypoglycaemia, has been 
included in the SmPC. As an additional pecaution, the SmPC includes recommendations to lower the 
dose when switching to Ryzodeg (IDegAsp). 
Although premixed insulins (fixed ratio of basal and bolus insulin) are not recommended in the current 
ISPAD guideline for treatment of children and adolescents with T1DM, since they remove the flexibility 
to adjust the doses of the separate insulin types, they may be advantageous in certain situations:  to 
improve compliance and/or adherence, as acknowledged in current guidelines, particularly in some 
clinical situations in the paediatric setting, for example during school time.  This is also in line with the 
view of a focus group with external paediatric diabetes experts put together by the MAH.

Even though the submitted data supports a positive benefit/risk balance for Ryzodeg in children above 
the age of 2 and in adolescents, it is recognized that this may not be the preferred treatment option 
for a large fraction of this population. The MAH has in the response to the second RSI presented data 
showing that a small percentage of the children below the age of six were already treated with a 
premixed insulin before inclusion in trial 3816. This also suggests that there may be an unmet medical 
need for premixed insulin in young children in a small proportion of the target population.  
In the current application, only data from children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes has been 
presented. However, as was previously already concluded similarly for insulin degludec (Tresiba), it is 
considered that efficacy and safety in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes can be 
extrapolated from studies with IDegAsp with patients of the same age range with type 1 diabetes and 
from studies with IDegAsp of adults with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the PK/PD-relationship for 
Ryzodeg is not expected to be different in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Insulin 
requirements may be higher in this population, but as IDegAsp needs to be individually titrated in any 
case, this is not of concern. Further, there is no indication that the safety profile would be markedly 
different in this population than in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. As hypoglycaemia is less 
common in type 2 diabetes than in type 1, this is considered to be at least equally manageable in 
these patients.   
During the procedure the Applicant has suggested to exclude children aged 1 to <2 years in the 
proposed indication. This is endorsed because of the relatively small doses of insulin injected, variable 
feeding patterns and activity levels and the inability to communicate symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 
these very young children.

Benefit-risk balance 
The data from the submitted studies support a positive benefit/risk balance for the use of Ryzodeg in 
children and adolescents with diabetes. The studies demonstrated the efficacy in non-inferiority trials. 
A lower number of injections may be advantageous in certain situations to improve compliance and/or 
adherence. Although Ryzodeg may not represent the treatment of choice for all children, it represents 
an additional option, to broaden the range of approved treatment options available for all age groups 
to meet the needs of individual patients, taking into account differences in life circumstances. The use 
of Ryzodeg in the youngest age group should be made with caution and be based on an individual 
assessment by the treating physician and when discussing the pros and cons with different insulin 
regimes with the patients and caregivers. These cautionary considerations are adequately described in 
the SmPC as guidance for the prescriber. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk balance for the treatment of diabetes in children from the age of 2 years 
and adolescents is considered to be positive.

Extension of Indication to include treatment of diabetes mellitus in paediatric population from 2 years 
of age for Ryzodeg; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the 
QRD template version 10.0. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0034/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
The divergent position to the majority recommendation is appended to this report. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include treatment of diabetes mellitus in paediatric population from 2 years 
of age for Ryzodeg; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the 
QRD template version 10.0. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and

Divergent position expressed by CHMP members: 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation of Ryzodeg for the following reasons: 
An indication in children from 2 years to less than 6 years is not supported based on:  
Safety issues: The data provided include an increased number of severe hypoglycaemic events 
observed in the study population with the study drug  (26/100 pty versus 7/100 pty), with an even  
higher frequency in the younger children (< 6 years). More hypoglycaemic events are reported during 
daytime. No SMBG data are reported at night and therefore it cannot be excluded that severe 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia is underreported. The data depend on the parents, either waking up due to 
observed noise, which will not always be the case (1), or waking up for checks.  
Therefore the risk that an increase in hypoglycaemia during the night may occur cannot be excluded. 
Based on the data -and the lack of data- and on potential long term consequences of these 
hypoglycaemic events in this age group, the drug should not be used in children less than 6 years old. 
Furthermore:  Current international treatment guidelines (CPCG 2014) recommend that physiological 
insulin replacement should be given to children of all age groups and the upcoming chapter specifically 
addressing management of diabetes in pre-schoolers confirms this (2). This is not compatible with a 
fixed dose insulin combination as this cannot be considered as a meal adjusted insulin administration 
(3). When using a fixed dose, life-style and food intake must be adjusted to insulin dose.  
Therefore, a positive benefit/risk has not been demonstrated in that population.

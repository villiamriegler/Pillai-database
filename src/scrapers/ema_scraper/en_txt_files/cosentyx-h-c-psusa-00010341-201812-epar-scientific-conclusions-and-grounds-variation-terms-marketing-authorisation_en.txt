Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for secukinumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of data presented in this PSUSA, covering the period from 26 December 2017 to  
25 December 2018, as well as cumulative data since the European birth date, the PRAC considers that the 
product information of medicinal products containing the active substance secukinumab should be updated 
as follows: the section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to include the adverse reactions “lower respiratory tract 
infections” and “inflammatory bowel disease” with a frequency uncommon; the package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for secukinumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing secukinumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

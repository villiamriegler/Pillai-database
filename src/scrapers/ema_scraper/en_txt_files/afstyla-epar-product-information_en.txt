The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The 
specific activity of AFSTYLA is 7400 - 16000 IU/mg protein. 
AFSTYLA is a single-chain recombinant human factor VIII produced in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells. It is a construct where most of the B-domain occurring in wild-type, full-length 
factor VIII and 4 amino acids of the adjacent acidic a3 domain were removed (amino acids 765 to 
1652 of full-length factor VIII). 
The newly formed linkage of the heavy and light chain of factor VIII introduces a new N-
glycosylation site. As the furin cleavage site present in wild type factor VIII between the B-
domain and the a3 domain was removed, AFSTYLA is expressed as a single-chain factor VIII 
molecule. 
Excipient with known effect:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). 
AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide 
the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary 
in their responses to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on 
bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of 
coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.

When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for 
determining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can 
be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the 
assay. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based 
one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance 
particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. 
Plasma factor VIII activity in patients receiving AFSTYLA using either the chromogenic assay or 
the one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency 
of repeat injections. The chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic 
potential of AFSTYLA and is preferred. The one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the 
factor VIII activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. If the 
one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the 
patient’s factor VIII activity level.  
Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII 
deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.  
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which 
are related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity 
in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in 
one ml of normal human plasma. 
Potency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay. 
Plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-
stage clotting assay.  
On demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 
International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 
IU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula: 
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired factor VIII rise (IU/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per 
IU/dl) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to 
the clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following 
table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
The recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times 
weekly. The regimen may be adjusted based on patient response. 
Paediatric population  
The recommended starting regimen in children (0 to <12 years of age) is 30 to 50 IU per kg of 
AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times weekly. More frequent or higher doses may be required in 
children <12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group.  
For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for 
adults (please refer to section 5.2). 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of AFSTYLA did not include subjects over 65 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use.  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
The reconstituted preparation should be injected slowly at a rate comfortable for the patient at a 
maximum injection rate of 10 ml/min. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with AFSTYLA. The product contains traces of 
hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use 
of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the 
early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  
For patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions appropriate pre-medication may be considered. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure 
days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon.  
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored 
for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the 
expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an 
appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with 
high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options 
should be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with 
experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Monitoring laboratory tests 
If the one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine 
the patient’s factor VIII activity level (see section 4.2). 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications 
including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.  
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains up to 35.0 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 1.8% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII products with other medicinal products have 
been reported. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare 
occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during 
pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
AFSTYLA has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
injection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely with the use of factor VIII products and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis 
(including shock). 
Development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with AFSTYLA. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level). The frequencies in the table below were observed in completed clinical

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics: Blood coagulation factor VIII.  
ATC code: B02BD02 
Mechanism of Action  
AFSTYLA (INN: lonoctocog alfa) is a recombinant human protein that replaces the missing 
coagulation factor VIII needed for effective hemostasis. AFSTYLA is a single polypeptide chain 
with a truncated B-domain that allows for a covalent bridge to link the factor VIII heavy and light 
chains. AFSTYLA has demonstrated a higher VWF affinity relative to full-length rFVIII. VWF 
stabilizes factor VIII and protects it from degradation. Activated AFSTYLA has an amino acid 
sequence identical to endogenous FVIIIa. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac 
patient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor 
VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated 
factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts 
fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is an x-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma 
levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age 
Study 1001 determined the efficacy and safety in the prevention of bleeding events in prophylaxis, 
hemostatic efficacy in the control of bleeding events and during perioperative management. The study 
enrolled 175 previously treated patients (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A (1 subject 
>60 years of age was enrolled) who accumulated a total of 14,306 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain. No 
patient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  
Prophylaxis: 146 subjects were assigned to a prophylaxis regimen (median ABR, 1.14 (interquartile 
range: 0.0, 4.2)), 79 (54%) were assigned a 3-times per week regimen and 47 (32%) a 2-times per 
week regimen. Patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and 
30 IU/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens 
of 4,283 IU/kg year. 
Treatment of bleeding: Of the 848 bleeding events observed during Study 1001, 93.5% were 
controlled with 2 or fewer injections. The median dose to treat a bleeding episode was 34.7 IU/kg. 
Perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): A total of 16 major surgical procedures were 
performed and assessed in 13 subjects in Study 1001. Hemostatic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surgical prophylaxis was rated as excellent or good in all surgeries. No paediatric subjects <18 years 
of age were included in the surgery population. 
Paediatric population <12 years of age 
Study 3002 enrolled a total of 84 previously treated patients <12 years of age (35 <6 years of age and 
49 6 to <12 years of age). The study participants accumulated a total of 5,239 EDs with rVIII-
SingleChain. No patient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction. 
Individualised prophylaxis: Of the 81 patients on prophylaxis (median ABR 3.69 (interquartile range: 
0.00, 7.20)), 43 (53%) were assigned to a 2-times weekly regimen and 25 (31%) to a 3-times per week 
regimen. Patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and 32 
IU/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens of 
4,109 IU/kg year.  
Treatment of bleeding: Of the 347 bleeding events observed during Study 3002, 95.7%were controlled 
with 2 or fewer injections. The median dose used to treat a bleeding event was 27.6 IU/kg. 
Extension Study 3001 enrolled 222 previously treated patients (67 patients <12 years of age). The 
mean (SD) number of EDs for PTPs in this study was 341.9 (135.48). A total of 212 subjects (95.5%) 
attained > 100 EDs. No new safety signals or concerns were identified from this extension study. 
Efficacy outcomes were comparable to what was reported in earlier studies. 
Previously untreated patients (PUPs) 
Study 3001 enrolled a total of 24 PUPs with a median age of 1.0 year (range: 0 to5 years). The study 
participants accumulated a total of 5909 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain (mean (SD): 245.5 (161.56) 
EDs). 
Individualised prophylaxis: A total of 23 PUPs received a prophylactic regimen during the study (11 
switched from on-demand). Under prophylaxis, median ABR was 1.84 (range: 0.0 to 23.6), median 
AsBR was 0.88 (range: 0.0 to 19.7). 
Treatment of bleeding: Of the 315 treated bleeding events observed (one major bleed), 88.9% were 
controlled with 2 or fewer injections. 
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) have been collected in patients with haemophilia A who 
have developed inhibitors to FVIII. 
Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates 
and between different clinical studies.  
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adult population  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of AFSTYLA was evaluated in 81 previously treated adult subjects 
who had been diagnosed with severe haemophilia A with <1% factor VIII and with age from 18-
60 years old, following an intravenous injection of 50 IU/kg.  
The PK parameters were based on plasma factor VIII activity measured by the chromogenic 
substrate assay (for discrepancy in the factor VIII activity determined with one-stage clotting 
assay, please see section 4.2). The PK profile obtained 3 to 6 months after the initial PK 
assessment was comparable with the PK profile obtained after the first dose.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
General instructions 
- 
The solution should be almost colourless, clear or slightly opalescent. After 
filtering/withdrawal (see below) the reconstituted product should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  
-  Do not use visibly cloudy solutions or solutions still containing flakes or particles.  
-  Reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions. 
Reconstitution and administration 
Bring the solvent to room temperature. Ensure powder and solvent vial flip caps are removed and 
the stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the 
Mix2Vial package. 
1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not remove 
the Mix2Vial from the blister package! 
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper. 
3.  Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set. 
4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down 
through the powder vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the powder vial.

13 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and 
unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two 
pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached. 
6.  Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake. 
7.  Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial's Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial.

Withdrawal and administration 
8.  While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly. 
9.  Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise.

For injection of AFSTYLA the provided administration sets are recommended to be used because 
treatment failure can occur as a consequence of factor VIII adsorption to the internal surface of 
some injection equipment. 
Care should be taken that no blood enters the syringe filled with product, as there is a risk that the 
blood could coagulate in the syringe and fibrin clots could therefore be administered to the 
patient.  
The AFSTYLA solution must not be diluted. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reconstituted solution should be administered by a separate injection/infusion line by slow 
intravenous injection, at a rate comfortable to the patient, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What AFSTYLA is and what it is used for  
AFSTYLA is a human clotting (coagulation) factor VIII product that is produced by recombinant 
DNA technology. The active substance in AFSTYLA is lonoctocog alfa. 
AFSTYLA is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor 
VIII deficiency). Factor VIII is a protein needed for blood to clot. Patients with haemophilia A lack 
this factor, so blood does not clot as quickly as it should and they have an increased tendency to bleed. 
AFSTYLA works by replacing the missing factor VIII in haemophilia A patients enabling their blood 
to clot normally. 
AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. 
2. 
What you need to know before you or your child use AFSTYLA 
Do not use AFSTYLA 
• 
if the AFSTYLA patient had an allergic reaction to AFSTYLA, or any of its ingredients (listed in 
section 6). 
if the AFSTYLA patient is allergic to hamster proteins. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Traceability 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your AFSTYLA. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So, every time you get a new package of AFSTYLA, note down the date and the batch number (which 
is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using AFSTYLA. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contain traces of hamster proteins 
(see also “Do not use AFSTYLA”). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, stop using the 
medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should inform you of the early 
signs of allergic reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that causes severe 
difficulty in breathing, and dizziness).  
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during 
treatment with all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
treatment working properly. You or your child will be monitored carefully for the development 
of inhibitors. If you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with AFSTYLA, tell your 
doctor immediately.  
If you or your child have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell 
your doctor or pharmacist. 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is used for injection of AFSTYLA, the risk of 
complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of 
a blood clot (thrombosis) in the blood vessel where it is inserted should be considered by your 
doctor and discussed with you. 
Other medicines and AFSTYLA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
• 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
During pregnancy and breast-feeding, AFSTYLA should be given only if it is clearly needed. 
• 
Driving and using machines 
AFSTYLA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
AFSTYLA contains sodium 
AFSTYLA contains up to 35.0 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial.  This 
is equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.   
3. 
How to use AFSTYLA 
Your treatment should be monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of blood clotting 
disorders. 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dose 
The amount of AFSTYLA you or your child need to take and the duration of treatment depend on: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the severity of your disease 
the site and intensity of the bleeding 
your clinical condition and response 
your body weight 
Follow the directions given to you by your doctor. 
46 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconstitution and administration 
General instructions 
• 
The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic 
conditions. 
AFSTYLA must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in 
section 6. 
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e., it might be 
sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or 
withdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked again, before it is used. Do not use the 
solution if it is visibly cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor.  
• 
• 
• 
Reconstitution and administration 
Without opening the vials, ensure the AFSTYLA powder and the liquid is at room or body 
temperature. This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by 
holding them in your hands for a few minutes.  
Do not expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 °C). 
Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below. 
1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not remove 
the Mix2Vial from the blister package! 
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper. 
3.  Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set. 
4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down 
through the powder vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the powder vial.

5.  With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and 
unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two 
pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached. 
6.  Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake. 
7.  Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial's Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial.

Withdrawal and administration 
8.  While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly. 
9.  Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise.

Use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back 
to the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. Inject 
the reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min) into 
the vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care not to get any blood in the 
syringe containing the product.  
Check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that 
might be related to the administration of AFSTYLA, the injection should be stopped (see also section 
2). 
48 
 
 
 
 
Use in children and adolescents 
AFSTYLA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher 
doses or more frequent injections may be needed. Children above 12 years of age can use the same 
dose as adults. 
If you use more AFSTYLA than you should 
If you have injected more AFSTYLA than you should, please inform your doctor. 
If you forget to use AFSTYLA  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately 
and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using AFSTYLA 
If you stop using AFSTYLA you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may 
not stop. Do not stop using AFSTYLA without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, AFSTYLA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Please stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor if: 
• 
you notice symptoms of allergic reactions  
Allergic reactions may include the following symptoms: hives, generalised urticaria (itchy rash), 
tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure, and anaphylaxis (a serious reaction that 
causes severe difficulty in breathing or dizziness). If this happens, you should stop using the 
medicine immediately and contact your doctor. 
you notice that the medicine has stopped working properly (bleeding is not stopped) 
For children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 
2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however, in patients who have 
received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) this is 
uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If you or your child has developed an inhibitor with the 
medicine, you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your 
doctor immediately.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide 
the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary 
in their responses to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on 
bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of 
coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. 
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for 
determining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can 
be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the 
assay. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based 
one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance 
particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. 
Plasma factor VIII activity in patients receiving AFSTYLA using either the chromogenic assay or 
the one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency 
of repeat injections. The chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic 
potential of AFSTYLA and is preferred. The one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the 
factor VIII activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. If the 
one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the 
patient’s factor VIII activity level.  
Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII 
deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.  
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which 
are related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity 
in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in preferably 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in 
one ml of normal human plasma. 
Potency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay. 
Plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-stage 
clotting assay. 
On demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 
International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 
IU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula: 
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired factor VIII rise (IU/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per 
IU/dl) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to 
the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.

In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following 
table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: 
Degree of haemorrhage / 
Type of surgical 
procedure 
Haemorrhage 
Early haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding or oral 
bleeding  
More extensive 
haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or haematoma 
Life threatening 
haemorrhages 
Surgery 
Minor surgery including 
tooth extraction 
Major surgery 
Factor VIII level 
required (%) (IU/dl) 
Frequency of doses (hours) / 
Duration of therapy (days) 
20 - 40 
30 - 60 
60 - 100 
30 - 60 
80 - 100  
(pre- and  
postoperative) 
Repeat injection every 12 to 24 
hours. At least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode as indicated by 
pain is resolved or healing is 
achieved. 
Repeat injection every 12 to 24 
hours for 3-4 days or more until 
pain and acute disability are 
resolved. 
Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Inject every 24 hours, at least 1 day, 
until healing is achieved. 
Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis 
The recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times 
weekly. The regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.  
Paediatric population 
The recommended starting regimen in children (0 to <12 years of age) is 30 to 50 IU per kg of 
AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times weekly. More frequent or higher doses may be required in 
children <12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group.  
For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for 
adults. 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of AFSTYLA did not include subjects over 65 years of age.

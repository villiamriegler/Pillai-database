1.  Introduction 
On 25th September 2020, the MAH submitted the final study report of the completed paediatric study 
GENA-05 for Nuwiq/Vihuma according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. In addition, an 
updated Critical Expert Overview has been provided that further includes information about the recent-
ly completed GENA-40 trial (a Phase 3b study in Chinese PTPs ≥6 years). GENA-05 was a prospective, 
open-label, non-controlled trial to evaluate the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of treatment with 
Human-cl rhFVIII in Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A. The most recent 
EMA guidelines no longer require formal PUP studies to be conducted. However, the EMA guidelines 
available at the time of initiation of this study stipulated a requirement for a paediatric study in PUPs. 
With implementation of Protocol Amendment 04, the study was to be completed in the 4th quarter of 
2018 for all patients, except those continuing ITI treatment. The ITI portion of GENA-05 was clinically 
completed in March 2020. Interim data of this study were already presented to EMA within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002813/II/0017/G (approved: 14 September 2017). 
As stated in the Cover Letter, dated 24 September 2020, no amendments to be introduced to the 
Product Information, and thus no regulatory consequences, have been identified by the MAH. 
Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa), currently marketed as Nuwiq and its duplicate Vihuma was ap-
proved in Europe in July 2014 for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemo-
philia A in all age groups. The study concerned by this article 46 procedure (GENA-05) has been con-
ducted as part of the clinical development program of Human-cl rhFVIII. A line listing of all non-clinical 
and clinical studies included in this program is annexed to this report. 
GENA-05 was conducted to fulfil the required evaluation of at least 100 PUPs for a minimum of 100 
EDs as stipulated by the EMA CHMP guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human 
plasma-derived factor VIII products that had been available at the time of study initiation. As such, the 
conduct and design of GENA-05 complied with an agreed PIP. However, in light of the latest update of 
this guideline, which removed the requirement of formal PUP studies, the main study was completed 
prematurely in December 2018. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Human-cl rhFVIII (simoctocog alfa) is a B domain-deleted recombinant human blood coagulation factor 
VIII (rhFVIII) concentrate for intravenous use. The protein is expressed in a human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) cell line derivative (HEK293F) adapted to grow in serum-free culture medium. Human-cl rhFVIII 
is supplied as lyophilised powder with nominal potencies of 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 IU per 
vial, to be reconstituted with 2.5 mL of water for injection.

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
GENA-05: Immunogenicity, Efficacy and Safety of Treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII in Previ-
ously Untreated Patients with Severe Haemophilia A 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
GENA-05: Immunogenicity, Efficacy and Safety of Treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII in Previously Un-
treated Patients with Severe Haemophilia A 
Description 
GENA-05 was a prospective, multicentre, multinational, open-label, non-controlled phase 3 study. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the immunogenicity, haemostatic efficacy and safety of Human-cl 
rhFVIII in at least 100 previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%). 
Patients who developed FVIII inhibitors were offered to start immune tolerance induction (ITI) with a 
maximum duration of 36 months. GENA-05 was initiated in 2013 and was clinically completed in De-
cember 2018, with the ITI phase finishing in March 2020. Upon study completion, patients could enter 
into the extension study GENA-15. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
The primary objective of this clinical study was to investigate the immunogenicity of Human-cl rhFVIII 
in 100 evaluable PUPs suffering from severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%). 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII during prophylactic treatment (based on the fre-
quency of spontaneous break-through bleeds) 
To assess the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII during treatment of bleeds 
To assess the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in surgical prophylaxis 
To assess the safety and tolerability of Human-cl rhFVIII 
Study design 
GENA-05 was designed as a prospective, multicentre, multinational, open-label, non-controlled phase 3 
study in 100 evaluable male PUPs (i.e. previously untreated patients) suffering from severe haemophil-
ia A (FVIII:C <1%). 
For each patient, the exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII, the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the prevention 
and the treatment of bleeds, the frequency of break-through bleeds in case of prophylactic treatment, 
the efficacy in surgical prophylaxis, and the overall safety and tolerability of Human-cl rhFVIII were 
thoroughly assessed. In the course of the follow-up visits (i.e. every 3-4 exposure days [EDs] until ED 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 4/24 
 
  
 
 
20, then every 10-12 EDs until ED 100), FVIII inhibitor levels (primary endpoint) were assessed for 
each patient. An inhibitor was assessed to be positive if the modified Bethesda assay (Nijmegen modi-
fication) resulted in a titre ≥0.6 BU/mL at any time point during the observation period. Inhibitor activ-
ity was determined centrally at the following time points: At baseline (Screening Visit), every 3-4 EDs 
until ED 20, every 10-12 EDs or every 3 months ±2 weeks (whichever came first) after ED 20, at study 
completion; at any time in the case of a suspicion of inhibitor development. In case of a positive inhibi-
tor result, an inhibitor re-testing using a second separately drawn sample was to be performed central-
ly; the result of the second sample was taken as the final result for the time point. Low titre inhibitors 
were defined as ≥0.6 to <5 BU/mL, high-titre inhibitors were defined as ≥5 BU/mL.  
Patients who developed a clinically significant and non-transient FVIII inhibitor were offered to start ITI 
with the IMP. Inhibitors that `disappeared´ without any clinical signs or symptoms, where no FVIII 
dosing increase was required, and that turned to <0.6 BU/mL within a period of 6 months after first 
detection, were regarded as “transient”. In case of a positive FVIII inhibitor (non-transient) but no ITI 
initiation within 1 year, the patient had to be withdrawn from the study. 
The efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in prophylactic treatment was evaluated based on the frequency of 
spontaneous breakthrough bleeds per months and was calculated and assessed as excellent, good, 
moderate or poor: 
-  Excellent: Less than 0.75 spontaneous BEs per month 
-  Good: Between 0.75 and 1 spontaneous BEs per month 
-  Moderate: Between more than 1 and 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
-  Poor: More than 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
At the end of a BE, the following efficacy assessment was made by the patient’s parent(s)/legal guard-
ian(s) (together with the investigator in case of on-site treatment): 
-  Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding 
within approximately 8 hours after a single infusion 
-  Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 – 12 
hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for complete resolution 
-  Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first infu-
sion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution 
-  None: No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 in-
fusions for complete resolution 
The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication were checked and documented at each 
follow-up visit. A patient completed the study by reaching 100 EDs, or after a maximum study partici-
pation period of 5 years from screening, or (with implementation of Protocol Amendment 04) study 
completion in the 4th quarter of 2018 for all patients except those continuing ITI treatment. In pa-
tients who developed FVIII inhibitors and start ITI treatment, the maximum length of ITI was to be 36 
months. 
Study population /Sample size 
GENA-05 was open to male previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C 
<1%). The patient population mainly entails newborns or infants; however, there was no limitation of 
age for study admission. 100 evaluable PUPs were to be enrolled in this study. This sample size was 
chosen to satisfy CHMP recommendations current at the time the study was initiated. 
EMA/841799/2022

Treatments 
Prophylactic treatment was recommended, but finally, it was the decision of the responsible treating 
physician whether patients were treated prophylactically or on demand. Patients could switch from on-
demand to prophylactic treatment, or from prophylactic to on-demand treatment during the course of 
the study. 
Prophylactic treatment: 
Patients were to be treated prophylactically with a recommended dose of 20-50 IU FVIII/kg body 
weight (BW). Starting prophylaxis with the first bleeding episode (BE) was highly recommended. The 
frequency of treatment depended on the patient’s clinical situation. For example, prophylaxis could be 
initiated with every other day injections (in order to keep the FVIII trough level >1%), or with once 
weekly injections, followed by twice and three times weekly, and every other day treatment. In cases 
of inadequate response, Human-cl rhFVIII administration frequency or dose adjustments could be con-
sidered at the Investigator’s discretion. 
On-demand treatment: 
In case of any bleed, the patients could be treated on-demand. The dosage and duration of treatment 
of spontaneous or traumatic bleeds depended on the location and the extent of bleeding as well as on 
the clinical situation of the patient. Dosage recommendations were given as follows: 
•  Minor haemorrhage: 20-30 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak level of about 
40% to 60%. Repeat dose every 8-24 hours until BE is resolved. 
•  Moderate to major haemorrhage: 30-40 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak 
level of about 60% to 80%. Repeat dose every 6-24 hours until BE is resolved. 
•  Major to life-threatening haemorrhage: initial dose of 40-60 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an in-
tended target peak level of 100% to 120%. Repeat dose of 20-50 IU FVIII/kg BW every 6-12 
hours until BE is resolved. 
Surgical prophylaxis: 
The dosage and duration of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII depended on the type of surgery and the 
patient’s individual incremental FVIII recovery. Dosage recommendations were given as follows: 
•  Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25-30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 3 hours prior 
to surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat one dose every 12-24 
hours if needed. Trough levels should be maintained at ≥30%. 
•  Major surgeries: 40-60 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended 
target peak level of approximately 100%. Repeat if necessary after 6-12 hours initially and for 
at least 6 to 14 days until healing is complete and recurrence to regular prophylactic treatment 
is possible. Trough levels should be maintained at >50%. 
FVIII recovery investigation (optional): 
Patients received 40 IU FVIII/kg BW for in-vivo recovery evaluation. Blood samples were taken at 
baseline, 15 minutes and 1 hour after the Investigational Medical Product (IMP) administration. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) (if applicable): 
Patients who developed a clinically significant and non-transient inhibitor were offered to start ITI with 
the IMP. The modified Bonn Protocol for inhibitor elimination was recommended: 
• 
Low responders (<5 Bethesda Units [BU/mL]) should receive 50-100 IU FVIII/kg BW daily or 
every second day. In case the inhibitor increases to 5 BU/mL or more, the patient should 
switch to the high responder regimen. 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 6/24 
 
  
 
 
•  High responders (≥5 BU/mL) should receive 100-150 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12 hours. 
Once the inhibitor had been eliminated (<0.6 BU/mL), the FVIII recovery was ≥66% of normal, and 
the half-life of FVIII was at least 6 hours, a continuous reduction of about 10% of the initial ITI dosage 
was to be initiated, until the patient had reached a prophylactic treatment regimen of 30-50 IU 
FVIII/kg BW every other day. Any other ITI approach was possible. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Criteria for evaluation were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Immunogenicity: FVIII inhibitor screen 
Prophylactic Treatment: Frequency of spontaneous breakthrough bleeds under three times 
weekly or every other day prophylactic treatment, and in case of surgical prophylaxis. 
Efficacy: Efficacy assessment at the end of each BE 
FVIII recovery Investigation: In vivo recovery (calculated from the FVIII plasma levels before 
infusion and the peak level obtained from the 15 minutes and 1 hour post-infusion samples) 
•  Safety: Adverse events, Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body tem-
perature, Safety laboratory parameters (red blood cell [RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] 
count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, alanine amino transferase [ALT], aspartate 
transaminase [AST], serum creatinine) 
Statistical Methods 
The statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints are descriptive. No inferential analysis 
involving formal testing was planned in this non-controlled trial.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 110 enrolled patients, 108 had data collected post-treatment with Human cl rhFVIII and were 
included in the ITT and safety analysis (SAF) populations. The patients were enrolled and treated at 38 
investigational centres in Belarus, Canada, France, Georgia, Germany, India, Italy, Moldova, Morocco, 
Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States. 
103 of the enrolled patients had at least one prophylactic treatment (i.e. at least one administration of 
Human-cl rhFVIII with prophylaxis documented as the reason for treatment) and constitute the PROPH 
population; 50 patients were in the population of subjects on continuous prophylaxis (PROPHcont). 
Eighteen of the 28 patients who developed FVIII inhibitors started ITI treatment. In the 108 treated 
patients, 1199 BEs were documented in 99 patients. Of these, 931 BEs in 94 patients were document-
ed as treated with Human-cl rhFVIII and therefore constituted the BLEED population. A total of 52 sur-
geries were documented in 37 patients. Twenty-six of these surgeries (in 24 patients) were performed 
under Human-cl rhFVIII treatment and were therefore included in the SURG population. 
Baseline data 
Age at screening in the safety population ranged from 0 to 146 months, with a median of 9.5 months. 
The majority of patients were White (82.4%); 13.0% were Asian and 1 patient (0.9%) was American 
Indian or Alaska Native. Overall, 42 (38.9%) had a family history of haemophilia, 13 (12.0%) had a 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 7/24 
 
  
 
 
family history of inhibitors to FVIII, and 73.1% of patients had a gene defect associated with a high 
risk of inhibitor formation. 
Immunogenicity results 
The primary endpoint of this study was the evaluation of FVIII-inhibitor development in PUPs treated 
with Human-cl rhFVIII. An inhibitor was assessed to be positive if the modified Bethesda assay (Nijme-
gen modification) resulted in a titre ≥0.6 BU/mL at any time point during the observation period. Of 
the 105 patients in the ITT population with at least one inhibitor test after ED1, 28 (26.7%; 95% CI: 
18.5-36.2) developed inhibitors, all with ≤34 EDs prior to detection; 17 (16.2%; 95% CI: 9.7-24.7) 
patients developed high titre inhibitors and 11 (10.5%; 95% CI: 5.3-18.0) patients developed low titre 
inhibitors.  
Table 1: 
Statistics on incidence of FVIII inhibitor development  
Source: Table 11, CSR 
Of the 28 patients who developed an inhibitor, 25 did so with ≤20 EDs prior to detection. Results were 
comparable in the PP population. The median number of EDs to first confirmed inhibitor activity was 
11.0 days (range: 4-34). Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses indicated that high risk F8 
gene mutation and age ≤12 months at first treatment are independent prognostic factors for the de-
velopment of inhibitors. No PUPs with non-null F8 mutations developed inhibitors. 
Efficacy results 
In GENA-05, data from inhibitor-free periods were the focus of the efficacy analyses to avoid bias that 
may result from the neutralising effect of inhibitors and/or the haemostatic effect of the increased dos-
es administered during ITI treatment.  
Prophylactic treatment: 
For the 103 subjects receiving prophylactic treatment in GENA-05, the mean (range) prophylactic dose 
per injection was 37.4 (16.1-96.0) IU/kg and the mean (range) prophylactic dose per month was 
288.4 (59-1455) IU/kg. 
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment was evaluated by the monthly rate of spontaneous break-through 
bleeds (MBR) during time of prophylactic treatment assessed as excellent, good, moderate or poor 
(secondary endpoint). The overall prophylaxis efficacy assessment for spontaneous BEs at end of study 
(a programmed, objective assessment) was excellent (MBR <0.75) in 100 (98.0%) patients, moderate 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 8/24 
 
  
 
 
 
(MBR >1–1.5) in 1 (1.0%) patient, and poor (MBR >1.5) in 1 (1.0%) patient. For all types of BEs, the 
mean MBR was 0.385 (95% CI: 0.299–0.472) and the mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was 4.693 
(95% CI: 3.635–5.751). For spontaneous BEs, the mean MBR was 0.080 (95% CI: 0.035–0.125) and 
mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was 0.976 (95% CI: 0.431–1.521). For patients on continuous 
prophylaxis (defined as a prophylactic treatment period of at least 169 calendar days, N=50), bleeding 
rates were lower: For spontaneous BEs, the mean MBR was 0.044 (95% CI: 0.019–0.069) and the 
mean ABR was 0.536 (95% CI: 0.233–0.839) and for all types of BEs, the mean MBR was 0.296 (95% 
CI: 0.207–0.386) and the mean ABR was 3.609 (95% CI: 2.523–4.694).

periods in GENA-05 
Source: Table 28, CSR 
Treatment of bleeding episodes: 
Of the 108 patients in the study, 99 patients experienced BEs, 94 patients had BEs that were treated 
with Human-cl rhFVIII, and 85 patients had BEs during inhibitor-free periods that were treated with 
Human-cl rhFVIII. The number of BEs in the BLEED population during inhibitor-free periods was 808 
(in 85 patients); 294 (36.4%) occurred in 66 patients during prophylactic treatment, 502 (62.1%) in 
51 patients during on-demand treatment, 4 (0.5%) in 3 patients during surgical prophylaxis, and 8 
(1.0%) in 4 patients during ITI treatment (patients could experience BEs in more than one of these 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 9/24 
 
  
 
 
 
categories). Of these 808 BEs, 196 (24.3%) were documented as spontaneous, 584 (72.3%) as trau-
matic, 4 (0.5%) post-operative, and 24 (3.0%) as other or unknown. Specific-site bleeds were most 
common in the knee (93 [11.5%]), oral cavity and ankle (both 76 [9.4%]), and arm, leg andnose 
(each 72 [8.9%]). ‘Other’ sites of bleeding accounted for the overall majority of bleeds characterised 
by multiple sites: 294 (36.4%). The majority of BEs during inhibitor-free periods (524 [64.9%]) were 
minor; 274 (33.9%) were moderate to major, 7 (1.9%) were major to life-threatening, and 3 (0.4%) 
were of unknown severity. The efficacy assessment at the end of a BE was based on an objective four-
point scale and done by the patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) (together with the Investigator in 
case of on-site treatment). The majority of BEs were rated as having excellent (63.4%, 510 BEs) or 
good (29.5%, 237 BEs) treatment efficacy; treatment efficacy was rated as moderate for 51 (6.3%) 
BEs and as none for 6 (0.7%) BEs. 
Table 3:

Source: Table 31, CSR 
The majority of BEs during inhibitor-free periods (91.9%) were treated with 1 or 2 infusions. The mean 
number of infusions per episode was 1.4 infusions (± 1.08, range: 1-11), and the mean dose per 
BE/kg body weight was 51.3 IU/kg (± 49.54, range: 15-663).  
Surgical prophylaxis: 
EMA/841799/2022

A total of 24 patients had 26 surgeries that were included in the SURG population. Of these, 13 pa-
tients had minor surgeries and 11 patients had major surgeries. Twenty-one of these surgeries had an 
overall efficacy assessment (based on objective 4-point scales) performed jointly by the haematologist 
and surgeon (the assessment was not performed for 5 surgeries), with 15 rated as having excellent 
efficacy, 3 having good efficacy, 2 moderate efficacy, and 1 with efficacy rated as “none”. The surgery 
with efficacy rated as “none” was performed in a patient with inhibitors. Patients received Human-cl 
rhFVIII prior to surgery (loading doses) and – if indicated – during surgery (maintenance doses), plus 
potentially after surgery up to discharge from the hospital. Infusions from prior to surgery until dis-
charge are summarised in Table 4 below. 
Table 4: 
Statistics on Human-cl rhFVIII Dosing for Surgical Coverage 
Source: Table 37, CSR 
FVIII Recovery Determinations 
Recovery determinations were optional (but recommended) within the study. Notable FVIII plasma 
levels were evident in the blood at 15 minutes post-administration, and levels remained at a consider-
able concentration at 1 hour. For the ITT population in patients without inhibitors the mean incremen-
tal IVR (% per IU/kg) ranged from 1.43 to 1.78.  
Immune tolerance induction 
Efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII as ITI was examined in 18 patients who developed FVIII inhibitors and 
continued into the ITI phase. The mean age at screening was 7.4 months (range 0–17). Complete suc-
cess of a patient’s ITI was defined as: 1) FVIII inhibitor negative (<0.6 Bethesda units [BU]/mL) at 
two sequential measurements; 2) FVIII recovery ≥0.99%/(IU/kg) (= 66% of 1.5 %(IU/kg); 3) FVIII 
terminal half-life ≥6 hours.  
Of the 18 patients included in the ITI sub-study, 4 (22.2%) patients finished ITI with complete success 
according to the investigator. Additionally, 1 patient had ITI treatment that was assessed as not suc-
cessful by the investigator despite meeting all 3 success criteria. Another patient was documented as 
having met all 3 success criteria before withdrawing consent and discontinuing the study and was not 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 11/24 
 
  
 
 
 
assessed as a complete success by the investigator. Therefore, the proportion of patients who had 
complete success of ITI according to investigator assessment or criteria from study data was 6/18 
(33.3%). One patient had partial success (2 criteria met) and 1 patient had a partial response (1 crite-
rion met) [5.6% each]. The remaining 10 patients had ITI failure, fulfilling none of the success criteria 
(3 due to therapy failure, 5 due to reaching 36 months of ITI treatment without reaching any success 
criterion, 1 due to withdrawn consent, and 1 due to permanent switch to another FVIII product).

Other Safety results 
The safety population comprised all 108 patients who received a total of 25,551 infusions of Human-cl 
rhFVIII across all assessments in the main study. Including the final phase of ITI treatment, patients 
had a mean (range) of 196.7 (1-1175) days of exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII, a mean of 258.6 (1-
2348) infusions, and a mean total dose of 21,339 (28-227,551) IU/kg. Under prophylaxis, patients had 
a mean of 70 EDs (median: 89 EDs, range: 1-115) and received a mean total dose of 2,659 IU/kg 
(median: 2,805 IU/kg, range: 28-9,313). 
Overall, 101 (93.5%) patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs. During the main study these 
were observed after 652 out of 25,551 infusions (2.6%) administered in the SAF population. Of the 
108 patients in the SAF population, 95 (88.0%) experienced mild AEs, 54 (50.0%) moderate AEs, and 
27 (25.0%) severe AEs. The most commonly reported AEs were pyrexia (56.5% patients), naso-
pharyngitis (32.4%), Factor VIII inhibition (25.9%), anaemia (19.4%), and rhinitis (18.5%). Eighty-
eight SAEs were documented in 48 (44.4%) patients. Two patients had AEs that led to the permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. These were a case of urticaria and an event of Factor VIII inhibition 
[primary reason for discontinuation was not initiating ITI treatment]). There were no deaths in this 
study. 
Seventy-eight patients (72.2%) experienced AEs that were temporally associated with 341 infusions, 
i.e. they occurred within 24 hours of the respective infusion. Based on the sponsor’s assessment, a 
total of 71 related AEs were recorded in 45 PUPs. In addition to FVIII inhibition (31 AEs in 28 patients), 
these included 28 cases of pyrexia in 20 (18.5%) patients, 5 cases of rash in 5 (4.6%) patients, 4 cas-
es of hypersensitivity in 2 (1.9%) patients, 2 cases of urticaria in 1 (0.9%) patient, and 1 case of chills 
in 1 (0.9%) patient. At least possibly related SAEs (according to the investigator’s assessment) were 
reported in 29 patients. These SAEs were Factor VIII inhibition (28 patients) and rash (1 patient). The 
only related AE reported in the final phase of ITI treatment was a case of FVIII inhibitor relapse. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As part of this Article 46 procedure the MAH submitted the final study report of GENA-05 together with 
an updated Critical Expert Overview. The aim of this phase 3 study was to investigate the immunogen-
icity, haemostatic efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with 
severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%). In this study, data was collected from 108 previously untreated 
children at 38 different investigational centers. 
GENA-05 was primarily conducted to fulfil the required evaluation of at least 100 PUPs for a minimum 
of 100 EDs as stipulated by the EMA CHMP guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 13/24 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
human plasma-derived factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1) that had been 
available at the time of study initiation. As such, the conduct and design of GENA-05 complied with an 
agreed PIP. However, in light of the recent update of this guideline which removed the requirement of 
formal PUP studies, GENA-05 was completed prematurely (in the 4th quarter of 2018), except for pa-
tients on ITI treatment. 
Interim data of GENA-05 were already presented to EMA in 2017 (EMEA/H/C/002813/II/0017/G) which 
led to removal of the statement "the safety and efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in previously untreated 
patients have not yet been established” in section 4.2 and inclusion of the risk of FVIII inhibitor devel-
opment in PUPs with a frequency category of “very common” in the ADR table of section 4.8 of the 
Nuwiq/Vihuma SmPC. 
The study population of GENA-05 is considered representative of the global population of PUPs with 
haemophilia A. As expected for PUPs, subjects were very young with a median age of 9.5 months 
[range: 0 to 146; 58 subjects (~62%) <1 year at enrollment]. Treatment recommendations for initia-
tion of prophylaxis and for the treatment of bleeds were largely comparable to previous trials in paedi-
atric PTPs and generally in line with the posology of Human-cl rhFVIII as reflected in the current SmPC. 
The primary endpoint of GENA-05 was the incidence of inhibitor development. The evaluation of clinical 
efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII during routine and surgical prophylaxis and the treatment of bleeds con-
stituted secondary endpoints. 
Inhibitor development 
Of the 105 patients in the ITT population with at least one inhibitor test after ED1, 28 (26.7%; 95% CI: 
18.5-36.2) developed inhibitors, all with ≤34 EDs prior to detection. Seventeen (16.2%; 95% CI: 9.7-
24.7) patients developed high titre inhibitors, all with ≤24 EDs prior to detection, and eleven (10.5%; 
95% CI: 5.3-18.0) patients developed low titre inhibitors, all with ≤34 EDs prior to detection. The re-
ported frequency of inhibitor development of 26.7% in the final report of GENA-05 is largely compara-
ble to the frequency reported in the interim analysis (i.e. 18 of 85 subjects, 21.2%) and does not 
change the frequency category of “very common” as specified in section 4.8 of the current SmPC. 
Overall, it is concluded that final data of Study GENA-05 reveal a rate of inhibitor development in the 
range of what has been reported for different FVIII products, particularly for the class of recombinant 
FVIII medicines. The SIPPET study is the only prospective, randomised, controlled study to compare 
the immunogenicity of pdFVIII. In patients treated with rFVIII, the cumulative incidence of all and 
high-titre inhibitors was 44.5% (95% CI: 34.7–54.3%) and 28.4% (95% CI: 19.6–37.2%), respective-
ly. The cumulative incidence of all and high-titre inhibitors in GENA-05 was 27.9 and 17.6%, respec-
tively. These rates are considerably lower than the rates reported for the rFVIII arm in the SIPPET 
study, all derived from hamster cell lines (cumulative incidence 44.5% for all inhibitors and 28.4% for 
high-titre inhibitors), and in line with results obtained for the pdFVIII arm of the SIPPET study (26.8 
and 18.6% for all and high-titre inhibitors, respectively). Reference: https://www.thieme-
connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0040-1722623.pdf 
However, as noted in the Article 31 referral for factor VIII medicines (EMA/765710/2017), comparabil-
ity of study results is generally hampered by the diversity of study methods and different patient popu-
lations evaluated. Notably, the reported rate of inhibitor development has to be interpreted in the con-
text of 23 of the 108 patients included in GENA-05 who received Human-cl rhFVIII for only 20 or fewer 
exposure days, 11 of whom with only 10 or fewer EDs (Listing 16.2.5.3.1). However, upon request the 
MAH substantiated the reported incidence of inhibitor development by excluding the subsets of inhibi-
tor negative subjects with less than 10, 20, or 50 EDs from the calculation. 
Other Safety data 
Other safety data obtained in GENA-05 are considered i) comparable to other products of this class, ii) 
consistent with previous experiences and iii) do not indicate safety issues specific to the group of PUPs. 
During GENA-05, a total of 71 related AEs were recorded in 45 PUPs. With the exception of FVIII inhi-
bition (31 AEs in 28 patients), there were 28 cases of pyrexia in 20 (18.5%) patients, 5 cases of rash 
in 5 (4.6%) patients, 4 cases of hypersensitivity in 2 (1.9%) patients, 2 cases of urticaria in 1 (0.9%) 
patient, and 1 event of chills in 1 (0.9%) patient. Notably, as a result of the type 2 variation procedure 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 14/24 
 
  
 
 
EMEA/H/C/002813/II/0017/G, ADRs from an allergic context (namely rashes, and urticaria) were col-
lectively referred to by the PT ‘Hypersensitivity’ that his currently included with a frequency category of 
‘common’ (i.e. ≥1/100 to <1/10) in section 4.8 of the product’s SmPC. Upon request, the MAH con-
firmed that final data of GENA-05 do not change this frequency category. 
The comparably high frequency of potentially drug-related pyrexia (i.e. 28 cases in 20 subjects plus an 
additional event of chills) has to be interpreted in the context of the very young age of the majority of 
study participants (median age: 9.5 months) and the generally high likelihood of developing pyrexia at 
this age. The current SmPC lists ‘Pyrexia’ as a common ADR and results of GENA-05 do not change this 
frequency category. 
In conclusion, results of GENA-05 are considered consistent with the known safety profile of Human-cl 
rhFVIII and do not evoke any new or specific concerns with regard to the treatment of PUPs. The newly 
reported ADRs are not considered remarkable and have already been reported for Human-cl rhFVIII or 
other products of this class.  
Incremental recovery of Human-cl rhFVIII 
In GENA-05, recovery determinations were optional (but recommended) in all patients. During the 
main study, IVR was calculated for a total of 45 inhibitor-free patients and 104 different time points 
(Listing 16.2.5.12). Based on the chromogenic assay, mean (SD) values calculated for different deter-
mination time points (at intervals of 6 months after ED1 and at the completion visit) ranged from 1.43 
(± 0.7) to 1.78 (± 0.3) % per IU/kg. Hence, on average values obtained in PUPs were slightly lower 
than the ones reported in 2 to 5 year old children in GENA-03 [i.e. 1.9 (± 0.3) %/IU/kg, see also 
SmPC section 5.2]. However, the trend towards lower IVR is considered consistent with the younger 
age of patients treated in GENA-05 (median age: 9.5 month) and considered sufficiently covered by 
the statement that especially in younger patients shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be nec-
essary in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis and in the treatment of BEs 
In GENA-05, mean doses of Human-cl rhFVIII administered per prophylactic infusion (i.e. 37.4 IU/kg) 
or for the treatment of BEs (i.e. 51.3 IU/kg) were largely comparable to the average doses used in 
previous trials in paediatric PTPs. For instance, a mean monthly prophylaxis dose of 288.4 IU/kg 
(range: 59–1455 IU/kg) in GENA-05 compares to a consumption of 330 IU/kg (range: 69–1554 IU/kg) 
reported in the long-term extension study GENA-15. The median number of infusions administered for 
the treatment of bleeding episodes was 1 in all paediatric studies with broadly comparable proportions 
of successfully treated events (i.e. 82.4% in GENA-03, 83.0% in GENA-13, 82% in GENA-40, 92.9% in 
GENA-05, and 77.5% in GENA-15). Except for a circumcision performed in a patient with high titre in-
hibitors (efficacy rated ‘none’), a CVAD insertion in a patient with low-titre inhibitors and a circumcision 
performed in a 69 months old boy (both rated ‘moderate’), all of the 21 procedures covered by Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII in GENA-05 (12 major and 9 minor surgeries) had an efficacy rating of ‘excellent’ or 
‘good’. 
Under prophylaxis, the mean ABR during inhibitor-free periods for all types of bleeds was 4.693 (± 
5.39). According to Table 14.2.19.6.1.1, ABRs ranged from 0 to 26.09 with a median of 2.77. Notably, 
these numbers have to be interpreted in the context of i) a considerable proportion of patients who 
received prophylaxis for less than 6 months and ii) a highly vulnerable population under study, prone 
to trauma-induced bleeding. Consistently, a separate analysis restricted to the subgroup of patients on 
continuous prophylaxis (i.e. ≥169 days, N=50) indicates lower bleeding tendencies with a median ABR 
of 3 and a range of 0 to 15 (Table 14.2.19.6.1.2). Furthermore, considering only spontaneous BEs, 
patients on continuous prophylaxis had a median ABR of 0 (range: 0 to 4.58) (Table 14.2.19.4.1.2). 
Hence, results of GENA-05 essentially confirm haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in prophylaxis 
and the treatment of BEs in previously untreated patients. 
Immune tolerance induction 
In GENA-05, efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in ITI was examined in 18 patients who developed FVIII in-
hibitors (6 patients with low-titre and 12 patients with high titre inhibitors). Definitions of ITI success 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 15/24 
 
  
 
 
(complete success, partial success and partial response) followed the publication of Kreuz et al. 2016 
and success criteria were in line with the International Immune Tolerance Study published in 2012 by 
Hay and DiMichele. In GENA-05, the proportion of patients with complete success of ITI according to 
the investigator’s assessment or criteria from study data was 6/18 (33.3%). 10 patients (55.6%) had 
ITI failure, fulfilling none of the success criteria after the 36-month observation period. The number of 
patients who underwent ITI within the GENA-05 study is too low to draw firm conclusions or to allow 
comparison with other studies, in different patient populations with dif-ferent ITI regimens. This suc-
cess rate appears considerably lower than the success rates reported in literature, varying from ap-
proximately 45% to 80% depending on the protocol (as e.g. noted in Ryu et al., 2015; doi: 
10.5045/br.2015.50.4.248). Furthermore, the reported success rate of ITI has to be interpreted in the 
context of 5 of the 6 successfully treated patients who had “only” low-titers of FVIII inhibitors, previ-
ously shown to often develop a natural (spontaneous) sustained negative inhibitor status (see e.g. Yoo 
et al. 2016, doi: 10.5045/br.2016.51.1.37 or Caram et al. 2011, doi: 10.1160/TH10-04-0231)On the 
other hand - and in line with the EMA reflection paper on ITI in haemophilia A (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/ 
153137/2011) - it is agreed with the MAH that comparisons across studies may be confounded by nu-
merous factors, including the use of differing success criteria and analysis methods, differing treatment 
durations and intensities, and differing patient populations regarding risk factors for ITI failure. How-
ever, given the comparably poor ITI outcome reported in GENA-05, it is concluded that a convincing 
proof of efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in ITI has yet to be provided. 
2.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, data obtained in previously untreated patients (PUPs) in GENA-05 do not change the fa-
vourable benefit risk profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in pediatric patients. The presented data do not war-
rant any substantial update of the Product information and no regulatory actions are expected to be 
required. Minor changes to the SmPC, namely an update of the numbers of evaluated subjects in sec-
tion 4.8 and removal of the sentence “A prospective open-label clinical study in PUPs with severe hae-
mophilia A (<1% FVIII:C) is ongoing” in section 5.1 should be implemented timely with the next revi-
sion of the SmPC. However, prior to a final recommendation, additional clarification on some of the 
reported clinical outcomes should be provided by the MAH. 
  Not fulfilled, additional clarification requested. 
EMA/841799/2022

3.  Additional clarification requested 
1.  The reported rate of inhibitor development (i.e. 26%) has been calculated including 23 patients 
who received Human-cl rhFVIII for only 20 or fewer EDs, 11 of whom with only 10 or fewer 
EDs (as noted in Listing 16.2.5.3.1). Hence, to account for a potential impact of insufficient ex-
posure, the MAH should specify (i.e. re-calculate) the rates of inhibitor development restricting 
the analysis to subjects with at least 10, 20, or 50 EDs to Human-cl FVIII. 
2.  The presented evaluation of haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of BEs was restricted to in-
hibitor-free periods. Nevertheless, efficacy was rated ‘none’ in 6 of the BEs treated with Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII. For these BEs, the MAH should critically discuss the apparent lack of efficacy. 
3.  As a result of the type 2 variation EMEA/H/C/002813/II/0017/G, the PT hypersensitivity in the 
ADR table of the SmPC (section 4.8) covers multiple AEs of allergic symptoms including events 
of rash and urticaria. Given the at least 12 additional drug-related “allergic” AEs (5 cases of 
rash, 4 cases of hypersensitivity, 2 cases of urticaria) reported in GENA-05, the MAH should 
confirm that the frequency category “common” (≥1/100 to <1/10) as specified in the current 
SmPC for the PT hypersensitivity remains unchanged. 
4.  Given the 28 additional cases of drug-related pyrexia (plus an additional event of chills) re-
ported in GENA-05, the MAH is requested to confirm that the frequency category “common” 
(≥1/100 to <1/10) as specified in the current SmPC for the PT pyrexia remains unchanged. 
5.  The exposure and safety information as summarized in the Critical Expert Overview (Tables 4 
and 5) neglect data obtained during the final phase of ITI treatment. The ITI addendum to the 
CSR solely covers data obtained in the ITI sub-study of GENA-05. Hence, it is not clear which 
of the AEs reported in the final phase of ITI add to the safety data presented in the main CSR 
(and the Clinical Expert Overview). Thus, the MAH should provide a comprehensive presenta-
tion of safety data obtained in GENA-05 (including the ITI sub-study) and, if necessary, update 
information on potentially drug-related AEs. 
Additional comment for the MAH: 
Minor changes to the SmPC, namely an update of the numbers of evaluated subjects in section 4.8 and 
removal of the sentence “A prospective open-label clinical study in PUPs with severe haemophilia A 
(<1% FVIII:C) is ongoing” in section 5.1 should be implemented timely with the next revision of the 
SmPC.

4.  Assessment of the responses to requested clarifications 
Question 1 
The reported rate of inhibitor development (i.e. 26%) has been calculated including 23 patients who 
received Human-cl rhFVIII for only 20 or fewer EDs, 11 of whom with only 10 or fewer EDs (as noted 
in Listing 16.2.5.3.1). Hence, to account for a potential impact of insufficient exposure, the MAH should 
specify (i.e. re-calculate) the rates of inhibitor development restricting the analysis to subjects with at 
least 10, 20, or 50 EDs to Human-cl FVIII. 
MAH’s responses 
The requested information is provided in the table below. Only a slight increase in the incidence of in-
hibitors was observed in the ED10, ED20, and ED50 subgroups as compared to total in the ITT popula-
tion. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The aim of this request was to assess the impact of subjects with little exposure to Human-cl rhFVIII 
on the reported rate of inhibitor development. For this, the applicant was expected to calculate the in-
cidences of inhibitors considering only the subsets of patients with at least 10, 20, or 50 EDs. However, 
in contrast to the EDs shown in listing 16.2.8.2 3 (i.e. excluding ITI treatment), the applicant appar-
ently did not discriminate between EDs during prophylaxis or ITI. Consequently, since i) three of the 
subjects with <10 EDs received only one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII and were not tested for inhibitors 
and ii) many of the subjects with <20 EDs during prophylaxis were tested positive and received addi-
tional (often extensive) dosing of Human-cl rhFVIII during subsequent ITI (Listing 16.2.8.2), only a 
small number of patients (N=4 with <10 EDs, N=6 with <20 EDs and N=7 with <50 EDs) were exclud-
ed from the original analysis. However, considering that the applicant’s approach selectively excludes 
subjects who did not develop an inhibitor, the presented calculations are regarded to result in rather 
conservative estimates. Since even on the basis of these calculation only a slight increase in the rate of 
inhibitor development was observed in the ED10, ED20, and ED50 subgroups, there are no outstanding 
concerns with regard to a relevant impact of subjects with “insufficient” EDs on the reported rate of 
inhibitor development. 
Issue resolved.

Question 2 
The presented evaluation of haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of BEs was restricted to inhibitor-
free periods. Nevertheless, efficacy was rated ‘none’ in 6 of the BEs treated with Human-cl rhFVIII. For 
these BEs, the MAH should critically discuss the apparent lack of efficacy. 
MAH’s responses 
According to the protocol, the treatment of a BE was rated by the patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
(together with the Investigator in case of on-site treatment) and documented by the investigator in the 
CRF. Efficacy was to be rated as “none” if there was no improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of 
symptoms, requiring more than 2 infusions for complete resolution. The 6 bleeding episodes (BEs) with 
efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII treatment rated as “none”. 
Summary 
The efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the treatment of BEs was assessed in the GENA-05 study based on 
a 4-point ordinal scale and documented by the investigator in the CRF. Efficacy was reported as “none” 
for 6 BEs, although, for one of these BEs the investigator noted that efficacy could not be assessed as 
the patient was undergoing ITI treatment. In all cases, these BEs resolved without requiring treatment 
other than Human-cl rhFVIII and the patient continued in the study until completion according to pro-
tocol. Other BEs occurring in the patients who had BEs with efficacy reported as “none” were well 
managed with Human-cl rhFVIII treatment, demonstrating the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in these 
patients. Overall, these 6 cases with efficacy rated as “none” do not indicate an overall lack of efficacy 
for the treatment of BEs with Human-cl rhFVIII, especially when considering that treatment with Hu-
man-cl rhFVIII was rated as “excellent” for 510 BEs, “good” for 237 BEs, and “moderate” for 51 BEs. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
As requested, the MAH provided additional details on the six BEs with an efficacy rating of “none”. Ac-
cording to the MAH’s response, one of these ratings likely resulted from an inappropriate dosing of 
Human-cl rhFVIII and another one should have been rated as “not available”, instead of “none”. All of 
the remaining BEs (4) were ultimately managed with Human-cl rhFVIII and resolved without the re-
quirement for other treatments. Furthermore, all patients who had BEs with efficacy reported as 
“none” experienced additional BEs which were successfully treated with Human-cl rhFVIII. Hence, the 
reported treatments with an efficacy rating of “none” do not change the conclusion of an overall satis-
fying haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in GENA-05. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 
As a result of the type 2 variation EMEA/H/C/002813/II/0017/G, the PT hypersensitivity in the ADR 
table of the SmPC (section 4.8) covers multiple AEs of allergic symptoms including events of rash and 
urticaria. Given the at least 12 additional drug-related “allergic” AEs (5 cases of rash, 4 cases of hyper-
sensitivity, 2 cases of urticaria) reported in GENA-05, the MAH should confirm that the frequency cate-
gory “common” (≥1/100 to <1/10) as specified in the current SmPC for the PT hypersensitivity re-
mains unchanged. 
MAH’s responses 
The existing calculation for the frequency of the PT hypersensitivity already includes the interim data of 
the GENA-05 study. With the new data from the finalized GENA-05 study the number of patients with 
ADRs within the PT term “hypersensitivity” changes from 6 of 280 to 8 of 298 and the frequency from 
EMA/841799/2022  
Page 19/24 
 
  
 
 
 
1/46 to 1/37.25. Consequently, it can be confirmed that the frequency category “common” (≥1/100 
to <1/10) as specified in the current SmPC for the PT hypersensitivity remains unchanged. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
As requested, the MAH confirmed an unchanged frequency category for the PT “hypersensitivity”. The 
MAH clarified that the underlying frequency calculation already includes interim data of GENA-05. 
Hence, final data of GENA-05 add only 2 patients with ADRs within the PT “hypersensitivity” to the ex-
isting safety database, changing its frequency from 1/46 to 1/37.25. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 4 
Given the 28 additional cases of drug-related pyrexia (plus an additional event of chills) reported in 
GENA-05, the MAH is requested to confirm that the frequency category “common” (≥1/100 to <1/10) 
as specified in the current SmPC for the PT pyrexia remains unchanged. 
MAH’s responses 
The existing calculation for the frequency of “pyrexia” already includes the interim data of the GENA-05 
study. With the new data from the finalized GENA-05 study, the number of patients with ADRs of “py-
rexia” or “chills” changes from 5 of 280 to 22 of 298, and the frequency from 1/56 to 1/13.54. Conse-
quently, it can be confirmed that the frequency category “common” (≥1/100 to <1/10) as specified in 
the current SmPC for the PT “pyrexia” remains unchanged. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
As requested, the MAH confirmed an unchanged frequency category for the PT “pyrexia”. The MAH 
clarified that the underlying frequency calculation already includes interim data of GENA-05. Hence, 
final data of GENA-05 add only 17 patients with ADRs within the PT “pyrexia” to the existing safety 
database, changing its frequency from 1/56 to 1/13.54. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 5 
The exposure and safety information as summarized in the Critical Expert Overview (Tables 4 and 5) 
neglect data obtained during the final phase of ITI treatment. The ITI addendum to the CSR solely co-
vers data obtained in the ITI sub-study of GENA-05. Hence, it is not clear which of the AEs reported in 
the final phase of ITI add to the safety data presented in the main CSR (and the Clinical Expert Over-
view). Thus, the MAH should provide a comprehensive presentation of safety data obtained in GENA-05 
(including the ITI sub-study) and, if necessary, update information on potentially drug-related AEs. 
MAH’s responses 
The presentation of safety data in the Critical Expert Overview includes all data obtained in study 
GENA-05, including the ITI sub-study. This therefore provides an overview of all safety data, including 
all treatment-related AEs. 
Compared to the final GENA-05 CSR, dated 21-June-2019, a further 22 AEs were observed in 5 pa-
tients by the time of completion of the ITI sub-study and are included in the Critical Expert Overview 
and the ITI CSR addendum. These AEs are listed below. One of these AEs was assessed as treatment-

related (FVIII inhibitor [relapse] in one patient and was serious. Most of the AEs were mild or moder-
ate infections, which are expected when monitoring long-term safety in young haemophilia patients. 
Assessment of the MAH’s responses 
The MAH clarified that the safety data summarized in the Critical Expert Overview covers all data ob-
tained in GENA-05, i.e. including the final phase of the ITI sub-study. Furthermore, the MAH specified 
that compared to the final GENA-05 CSR, a further 22 AEs were observed in 5 patients by the time of 
completion of the ITI sub-study. Of these, only a case of FVIII inhibitor relapse was considered related 
to the study drug. Hence, the MAH’s response does not change the conclusion of an overall acceptable 
safety profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in PUPs. 
Issue resolved. 
Comment for the MAH: 
Minor changes to the SmPC, namely an update of the numbers of evaluated subjects in section 4.8 and 
removal of the sentence “A prospective open-label clinical study in PUPs with severe haemophilia A 
(<1% FVIII:C) is ongoing” in section 5.1 should be implemented timely with the next revision of the

5.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation on the re-
sponses to requested clarifications  
In summary, data obtained in previously untreated patients (PUPs) in GENA-05 do not change the fa-
vourable benefit risk profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in pediatric patients. The MAH provided appropriate 
responses to requests for supplementary information. The presented data do not warrant any update 
of the Product information and no regulatory actions are required. 
  Fulfilled, no further action required.

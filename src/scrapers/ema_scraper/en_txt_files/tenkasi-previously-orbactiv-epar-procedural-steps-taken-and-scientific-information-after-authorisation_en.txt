drug interaction effect of a single 1200mg dose of 
oritavancin on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin  
following a single dose was conducted in 36 healthy 
subjects. S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were evaluated 
following a single dose of warfarin 25mg given alone, or 
administered at the start, 24, or 72 hours after a single 
1200mg dose of oritavancin. The results showed no effect 
of oritavancin on S-warfarin exposure (AUC) and maximum 
concentration (Cmax).

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Viread 
(Tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate)) 
On 20 September 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion recommending variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Viread, including a new formulation, new strengths for an existing formulation and a number 
of new indications. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
Viread Oral Granules – new formulation and new indication 
HIV-1 infection 
Viread 33 mg/g oral granules are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products 
for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the 
use of first line agents, from 2 to < 6 years of age, and above 6 years of age for whom a solid dosage 
form is not appropriate. 
Viread 33 mg/g oral granules are also indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate. 
In adults, the demonstration of the benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one study 
in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies 
in which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral pre-
treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of 
patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
The choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based 
on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

information 
Indication(s) in the EEA 
Chemical class: 
Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-iduronidase. Purified 
laronidase is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 
83 kD and 628 amino acids after cleavage of the N-terminus. The 
molecule contains 6 N-linked oligosaccharide modifications sites. 
Summary of mode action: 
The rationale for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is to restore a level 
of enzymatic activity sufficient to hydrolyse the accumulated substrate 
and to prevent further accumulation. After IV infusion, laronidase is 
rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into 
lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors. 
Important information about its composition: 
• Sodium chloride
• Sodium phosphate monobasic, monohydrate
• Sodium phosphate dibasic, heptahydrate
• Polysorbate 80
• Water for injection
Laronidase is produced by recombinant DNA technology using 
mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture. 
Refer to e-CTD sequence 0090, Module 1.3.1 English proposed Product 
Information. 
Current: 
Laronidase is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in 
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; 
α-L-iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations 
of the disease. 
Proposed: 
Not applicable 
Dosage in the EEA 
Current: 
Laronidase treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in 
the management of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic 
diseases. Administration of laronidase infusions should be carried out in 
an appropriate clinical setting where resuscitation equipment to manage 
medical emergencies is readily available. 
Posology 
The recommended dosage regimen of laronidase is 100 U/kg body 
weight administered once every week. 
Method of administration 
Laronidase is to be administered as an IV infusion. 
The initial infusion rate of 2 U/kg/h may be incrementally increased every 
fifteen minutes, if tolerated, to a maximum of 43 U/kg/h. The total volume 
of the administration should be delivered in approximately 3 to 4 hours.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 
INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Laronidase is indicated for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS I to treat 
the non-neurological manifestations of the disease. 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I is a panethnic, chronic and progressive, autosomal recessive 
lysosomal storage disease affecting both sexes. Precise figures for MPS I incidence are lacking, but 
estimated incidence is approximately one case per 100 000 births: in England and Wales from 
1981-2003, global incidence was 1.07 cases per 100 000 births. (1) An Australian study estimates 
that MPS I incidence is 0.9 cases per 100 000 births. (2) 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I has been broadly categorized into Scheie syndrome, Hurler-Scheie 
syndrome and Hurler syndrome, representing clinical phenotypes ranging from least severe to most 
severe. The prevalence of the sub-syndromes of MPS I were Hurler syndrome: 0.76/100 000, 
Hurler-Scheie syndrome 0.24/100 000 and Scheie syndrome 0.07/100 000. (3) ALDURAZYME 
(laronidase) is indicated for patients with Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of MPS I and for patients 
with the Scheie form who have moderate to severe symptoms. 
The epidemiology of the disease is summarized in the following table: 
Table 6 - Epidemiology of the Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) 
Indication 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) 
Birth incidence and 
population prevalence 
Demographics of the 
population in the 
authorized indication(s) 
In the US, the incidence was found to be 0.98 per 100 000 live births, and prevalence was 
found to be 2.67 per 1 million. 
Global incidence of MPS I is approximately 1 case per 100 000 births, with Hurler 
syndrome accounting for about 57% of the cases, Hurler-Scheie for about 23% of the 
cases, and Scheie syndrome for about 20% of the cases. (1)(2)(3) 
In Europe, birth prevalence data for MPS I are available in several countries, with reported 
birth prevalence per 100 000 being as follows: Switzerland 0.19, Czech Republic 0.72, 
Denmark 0.54, Norway 1.85, Sweden 0.67, Germany 0.69, the Netherlands 1.19, Northern 
Ireland 1.66, United Kingdom 1.07, Poland 0.22 and Portugal 1.33. (4) 
Demographics of the target population 
Demographics of MPS I patients can be derived from the worldwide MPS I Registry. (5) A 
total of 1069 patients enrolled in the MPS I Registry as of 06-Mar-2014, were described in 
the 2014 Global Annual Regulatory report. A summary of patient clinical phenotype, as 
well as current, geographic region, age of symptom onset, age of diagnosis, and age of 
first treatment, are presented below.

Risk factors for the disease 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I disease is referred to as an autosomal recessive disorder. 
A person is born with the disease by inheriting two faulty MPS I genes, one from each 
parent. There is no known environmental risk factor. 
Among the available approaches to treat MPS I, HSCT is typically recommended for 
patients with Hurler syndrome under 2 years of age with normal cognition (developmental 
quotient >70), as it can prolong survival, preserve neurocognition, and ameliorate some 
somatic features. (6) However, due to its significant morbidity and mortality, HSCT is

reserved for the most severe form of MPS I. (6)(7)(8) The allogenic stem cell infusion is 
given following conditioning with chemotherapeutic agents used to suppress the immune 
response; when successful, the transplant is a one-time procedure, though graft failure 
may necessitate subsequent transplants. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase is 
the primary treatment option for patients with Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes. 
Laronidase is also used to treat Hurler patients who are not candidates for HSCT because 
of age, health status, access to transplant, or parental choice. Laronidase must be given 
as a weekly peripheral or central IV infusion and is a lifelong therapy. (3) 
Hurler syndrome describes patients with the most severe form of MPS I, with signs and 
symptoms typically appearing in infancy and a median age of death of 6.8 years when 
untreated. (1) Patients with Scheie syndrome present later in childhood and demonstrate 
slower symptom progression with preservation of cognition and survival into adulthood. (9) 
Hurler-Scheie describes an intermediate form with no or mild cognitive impairment and 
death usually occurring in adolescence or early adulthood when untreated. 
Clinical manifestations of MPS I show a chronic multisystemic and progressive course 
which differs across clinical phenotypes. (10) The disease is highly heterogeneous, 
spanning a spectrum of severity. Symptoms across the types include facial dysmorphism, 
ophthalmologic manifestations, visceral involvement, skeletal involvement, 
cardiopulmonary manifestations, and neurological impairment. 
Children with Hurler syndrome appear normal at birth and develop the characteristic 
appearance over the first years of life. (11) 
Concomitant medications often used in this target population are those prescribed to treat 
comorbidities.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
Several non-clinical safety studies were conducted to evaluate the toxicology profile of laronidase 
for use as an ERT in patients with MPS I disease. The toxicology program conducted with 
laronidase includes single-dose studies in rats and dogs, repeat-dose studies in dogs (8 weeks) and 
cynomolgus monkeys (26 weeks), fertility and reproductive toxicity study in rats and 
developmental toxicity study in rats. Non-clinical evaluation with in vivo models of MPS I disease 
has shown laronidase is able to reverse biochemical and histopathological manifestations of the 
disease. Toxicological evaluation in rats, dogs, and monkeys suggest an acceptable safety profile for 
human use. 
The key non-clinical safety findings are presented in the following table. 
Table 7 - Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage 
Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to human usage 
Toxicity 
• Single-dose toxicity studies
Acute IV toxicity studies in the rat at doses of 0.29 mg/kg, 
0.58 mg/kg and 5.8 mg/kg and in the dog at doses of 
0.116, 1.16 mg/kg and 11.6 mg/kg demonstrated that 
laronidase did not produce toxicity at the highest doses 
tested in each species. The maximum doses tested in 
rats and dogs are equivalent to 
approximately 1.0 and 6.4 mg/kg, respectively, in 
humans, based upon equivalent body surface area. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies 
When administered to beagle dogs via 4 hour IV infusion 
at 1.66 mg/kg once weekly for 8 weeks, laronidase 
induced responses that included facial edema, emesis, 
mucoid stools and/or excessive salivation; the effects 
were transient and resolved by the end of infusion in most 
cases. The status of the cardiovascular system during 
these events was found to be within normal limits. All 
dogs developed IgG antibodies in this study and fixed 
complement during the infusions where IARs occurred. 
In a 26 week IV toxicity study of laronidase in cynomolgus 
monkeys at doses of 0.166 mg/kg, 1.66 mg/kg, and 
16.6 mg/kg, given as an 8 hour infusion weekly, there 
were no treatment-related mortalities, differences in body 
weight, or differences in food consumption. The sole 
abnormal clinical sign was edema, which was observed in 
one monkey in the 16.6 mg/kg dose treatment group and 
was judged to hypersensitivity response to a recombinant 
human protein. There were no observations noted with 
subsequent dosing. 
By week 13, all treated monkeys developed antibodies 
with levels ranging from 61 to 8844 A450 U/μL. Antibody 
Hypersensitivity reactions similar to those observed in 
cynomolgous monkeys and dogs have been documented in 
human clinical trials (Study ALID 006-01). These reactions 
have been added to the important identified risk of 
“Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis” (see [Part II module SVII]) and are included in 
the product label. They are also monitored by routine 
pharmacovigilance assessments. 
Relevance to human usage 
Development of IgG antibodies against laronidase has been 
observed in most patients receiving laronidase during 
2 pivotal trials and during the postmarketing 
phase. Immunoglobulin E antibody formation has also been 
observed. 
As observed in cynomolgous monkeys, small changes in total 
leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil and monocyte counts were 
observed in MPS I patients during the pivotal clinical trials of 
Laronidase (ALID 003-99 and ALID 006-01). The n with 
hematology values that shifted from normal to abnormal were 
very small and not considered clinically relevant in either 
treatment group. 
No reproductive toxicity and no developmental toxicity were 
reported in animals. No issues have been observed in 
postmarketing experience (see [Part II module SVII]). 
Key Safety Findings 
response was dependent on dose of laronidase; there 
was no difference in antibody levels between the sexes. 
Antibody levels decreased in approximately half of the 
monkeys between weeks 13 and 26 and increased in the 
remaining animals; these changes were not 
dose-dependent. 
Treatment with laronidase at 16.6 mg/kg increased total 
leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and/or monocyte 
counts at 1 or more time intervals. The changes were 
small in magnitude, their underlying cause was not clear 
from the other data evaluated and they are not 
considered to be biologically significant. There was no 
evidence of laronidase accumulation in the liver, which is 
the organ found to have the highest laronidase levels in 
biodistribution studies. 
• Reproductive toxicity studies
In a study of fertility and reproduction toxicity in male and 
female rats (Study IDU-PC-013), laronidase was 
administered daily by IV route at doses of 0.036 mg/kg, 
0.36 mg/kg, and 3.6 mg/kg. There were no mortalities. No 
effects on mating and fertility parameters were observed 
and there were no treatment-related effects on sperm 
parameters or findings on gross necropsy. There was no 
effect on litter parameters or treatment-related fetal 
effects. There was no reproductive toxicity seen at doses 
up to 3.6 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.58 mg/kg, in humans, 
based upon equivalent body surface area). 
In a study of developmental toxicity in rats, laronidase 
was administered daily by IV route at doses 
of 0.036 mg/kg, 0.36 mg/kg, and 3.6 mg/kg. No mortality 
or other treatment-related clinical signs were observed, 
and there were no laronidase-related effects on litter 
parameters.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Laronidase is a recombinant α-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes hydrolysis of 
terminal α-L-iduronic acid residues of dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate. 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I disease is characterized by the deficiency of α-L-iduronidase. 
Reduced or absent α-L-iduronidase activity results in the accumulation of the 
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) substrates, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate, throughout the body 
and leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. The rationale of laronidase therapy 
in MPS I disease is to provide exogenous enzyme for uptake into lysosomes and increase the 
catabolism of GAG. Laronidase uptake by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the 
mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of laronidase binding to specific 
mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Exposure of human subjects to laronidase in the clinical trial 
setting was limited given the orphan indication, a brief overview is provided in and Table 8. 
Laronidase is indicated for long-term ERT in patients with MPS I to treat the non-neurological 
manifestations of the disease. 
Laronidase was shown to improve pulmonary function and walking ability. As laronidase does not 
cross the blood-brain barrier, it has not been evaluated for efficacy in the central nervous system 
manifestations of the disorder. 
Laronidase is marketed as ALDURAZYME, a concentrated solution for IV infusion; 1 mL contains 
approximately 0.58 mg (100 U) of laronidase. Each 5 mL vial contains approximately 2.9 mg 
(500 units) in an extractable volume of 5.0 mL. 
Laronidase was first registered in the US; the Biologic License Application (BLA 125058) for 
laronidase 5 mL/vial (2.9 mg/vial) received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on 
30 April 2003 for the treatment of patients with Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of MPS I and for 
patients with the Scheie form who have moderate to severe symptoms. The risks and benefits of 
treating mildly affected patients with the Scheie form have not been established. In the EU, the 
500 U/5 mL vial presentation received marketing authorization approval from the European 
Commission (centralized procedure) on 10 June 2003 (EU/1/03/253/001-003) for long-term ERT in 
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS I to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the 
disease. 
Total exposure in 8 completed and 1 open label/ongoing laronidase studies is 126 patients as shown 
in Table 8. Duration of exposure to laronidase in the clinical studies ranged from 
26 weeks to 6 years at doses varying from 0.58 mg/kg every week to 1.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The 
ages of treated patients in the clinical trials ranged from 0.5 to 43 years.  
There is one local clinical trial with recent active enrollment, with 2 patients treated as of DLP. 
Moreover, as laronidase is a mature product, a summary based on duration of exposure would be of 
limited relevance compared to the postmarketing experience accumulated since international birth 
date (IBD) of 30 April 2003. The exposure by age/gender is shown for the completed and 
open-label/ongoing (ALID01803) studies in Table 8 while the exposure by race is shown in

LIMITATIONS TO DETECT ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES  
As a consequence of the rarity of MPS I disease, the n populations treated in the pre-authorization 
phase has been limited. Therefore, limitations of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) detection, 
especially the uncommon and rare ones, might have been initially related to the size of the studied 
population. Laronidase has been now in clinical use since 1997 and data from postmarketing 
exposure compensated for limitations in the clinical trial development program in detecting ADRs 
in the exposed population.

LIMITATIONS IN RESPECT TO POPULATIONS TYPICALLY 
UNDER-REPRESENTED IN CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 
Table 11 - Exposure of special populations included or not in clinical trial development programmes 
Type of special population 
Exposure 
Pregnant or breast-feeding 
women 
• The safety and efficacy of laronidase in pregnant or lactating women has not
been established in the pre-authorization phase. To date, the safety and efficacy
of laronidase in pregnant or lactating women has not been established.
• It is not known whether the active form of laronidase is excreted in human milk.
Type of special population 
Exposure 
Patients with relevant 
comorbidities 
• Patients with hepatic impairment
• Patients with renal impairment
• The safety and efficacy of laronidase in patients with hepatic insufficiency have
not been evaluated and no dosage regimen can be recommended in these
patients.
• The safety and efficacy of laronidase in patients with renal insufficiency have not
been evaluated and no dosage regimen can be recommended in these patients.
Patients of different racial and/or 
ethnic origins 
The studies were conducted globally. No ethnic groups were excluded from the 
studies; A Japanese specific study was conducted (ALID02205) and the conclusion 
for Japanese patients was similar to what was observed in Western countries. 
Subpopulations carrying known 
and relevant genetic 
polymorphisms 
Other 
• Geriatric use
There have been no investigations of subpopulations with genetic polymorphisms. 
The safety and efficacy of laronidase in elderly has not been established and no 
dosage regimen can be recommended in these patients. 
Pregnant or breast-feeding women 
Very limited data are available concerning the use of laronidase in pregnant or breast-feeding 
women. However, pregnant and breast-feeding women are part of the target population. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonal/fetal 
development, parturition and post-natal development. The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Therefore, laronidase should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Laronidase 
may be excreted in milk. Because there are very limited data available in neonates exposed to 
laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended to stop breast-feeding during laronidase treatment. 
Due to limited information, the use of laronidase in pregnant or breast-feeding women is considered 
as missing information. In order to collect additional information, an ongoing monitoring through a 
MPS I pregnancy sub-registry study (ALID04911) and a lactation study (ALID01803) have been 
set up. 
Patients of different racial and/or ethnic origins 
To date, there is no evidence of differences in the safety profile of laronidase in patients of different 
racial or ethnic origins. 
Subpopulations carrying known and relevant genetic polymorphisms 
To date, there is no information suggesting the existence of polymorphism relevant to the efficacy 
or safety of laronidase in the current indication. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of laronidase in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have not been 
evaluated. 
Geriatric use 
The safety and efficacy of laronidase in patients older than 65 years have not been established. 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SV: POST-AUTHORIZATION 
EXPERIENCE  
SV.1 
POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPOSURE 
The majority of laronidase use is within the approved indication of patients with MPS I. In the EU, 
laronidase is indicated for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS I to treat 
the non-neurological manifestations of the disease while in the US laronidase is indicated for 
patients with Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of MPS I and for patients with the Scheie form who 
have moderate to severe symptoms. The risks and benefits of treating mildly affected patients with 
the Scheie form have not been established. No significant safety findings on misuse have been 
identified. Laronidase is indicated for and used in pediatric populations, there is no specific safety 
concern related to its use in this patient population. 
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure 
The method of estimation of patients treated with commercial laronidase by the marketing 
authorization holder (MAH) is based on direct interactions of MAH with regional offices at country 
level. Because laronidase is dosed in milligrams per kilogram and administered to a patient 
population with varying weights, the calculated number of vials distributed is not useful from a dose 
calculation perspective. Therefore, the estimated n treated with commercial laronidase is calculated 
from sales figures received from the MAH’s regional offices, on the basis of direct interaction with 
prescribing physicians. Prescribers are queried as to how many patients are treated or how many 
prescriptions for laronidase are written, depending on individual country regulations. This 
information is then checked by MAH by analyzing the order patterns. Patients who received 
laronidase treatment via clinical trials or the International Charitable Access Program (ICAP) may 
have transferred to commercial product upon reimbursement. Patients are only counted in 
one category with the intent to avoid overlap between the ICAP, clinical trial and commercial 
exposure data.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVI: ADDITIONAL EU 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
SVI.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Laronidase has no known pharmacological addictive effect that could lead to misuse for illegal 
purposes and is not listed among drugs with addictive potential by the European Monitoring Centre 
for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Thus, this concern is not applicable to laronidase. 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVII: IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL 
RISKS   
SVII.1 
IDENTIFICATION OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE INITIAL RMP SUBMISSION 
The following safety topics will be discussed in this section and will be presented 
in Section SVII.1.1 (if the risks are not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP) or in Section SVII.1.2 (if the risks are considered important for inclusion in 
the list of safety concerns in the RMP): 
•
•
Infusion site reactions (Section SVII.1.1)
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis (Section SVII.1.2)
• Medication errors in home infusion (HI) setting (Section SVII.1.2)
• Use of laronidase in pregnant and lactating women (Section SVII.1.2)
SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP  
Reason(s) for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Infusion site reactions is an identified risk, not considered important. Infusion site reactions are 
frequently reported with laronidase, the events are associated with local injury/inflammation at the 
injection/infusion site. The reactions are mostly mild and of short duration. 
SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP

Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis  
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Scientific evidence that has 
led to the inclusion 
Data from clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance data. 
As with any IV protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. 
Infusion-associated reactions constitute most of the related AEs in the clinical trials. 
Infusion-associated reactions were experienced by 53% of the patients in the 
Phase 3 study (treated for up to 4 years) and 35% of the patients in the under 5 age 
group of study (up to one year of treatment). 
In clinical trials most patients developed IgG antibodies. Testing for IgE antibodies was 
rarely indicated during the clinical studies. In the postmarketing experience, 
approximately 1% of patients experienced severe or serious infusion allergic reactions 
and were tested positive for IgE. 
The most SARs reported with laronidase treatment during clinical trials were 
anaphylactic and allergic reactions. A patient with pre-existing airway compromise 
developed a severe reaction 3 hours from the start of the infusion (at week 62 of 
treatment) consisting of urticaria and airway obstruction, requiring tracheostomy. 
During the postmarketing experience, most of AEs associated with laronidase infusions 
were mild to moderate in severity. The onset of hypersensitivity related symptoms 
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Risk-benefit impact 
generally occurred during or shortly after infusions. Life-threatening anaphylaxis, 
including anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock have been reported. 
Severe IARs have been reported in patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper 
airway involvement. Patients with an acute underlying illness at the time of laronidase 
infusion appear to be at greater risk for IARs. 
Infusion associated reactions are a known risk with enzyme replacement therapies. This 
risk is managed routinely by the prescribing physicians that are experienced in the risk 
and management of IARs. The impact of IARs on the benefit-risk balance is considered 
manageable based on the anticipated experience of this specialized HCP community. 
AE: Adverse Event; HCP: Healthcare Professional; IAR: Infusion-Associated Reactions; IgG: Immunoglobulin G; IgE: Immunoglobulin E;

errors in home infusion (HI) setting  
Medication errors in home infusion (HI) setting 
Scientific evidence that has 
led to the inclusion 
Risk-benefit impact 
Medication errors have been reported with laronidase involving product dose omission 
issue, inappropriate schedule of product administration and other indicative events. 
Access to HI should minimize the patients issue of missing doses. However, there are 
potential issues regarding medication errors in HI setting, as follows: 
• dosage may vary as patient’s weight may change over time.
• recommended rate of infusion administration (slow infusion, on average 3 hours)
and necessary changes to rate.
• healthcare professional experience in performing venipunctures, administering
infusions, handling IARs.
The review of available information has not shown any difference between the settings 
at home and in the clinic. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase provides 
clinical benefit to patients. The expected benefits (if recommendations for laronidase 
infusion are followed) are increased access to properly administered weekly infusions 
(with use of recommended doses) and potential increase in QoL.  
The benefit-risk balance remains positive. There is no deleterious impact on the 
benefit-risk balance anticipated for this product. 
HI: Home Infusion; IAR: Infusion-Associated Reaction; QoL: Quality of Life.

Use of laronidase in pregnant and lactating women 
Scientific rationale for 
anticipating a different safety 
profile in the particular 
subpopulation/use that has 
led to the inclusion 
• Infants are at risk of toxicity from drugs used by adults; toxicity may occur prenatally
when they are exposed via placental transfer or postnatally when exposed through
breast milk.
• The first trimester of pregnancy involves major development/embryofetal
organogenesis; it is a critical period for drug toxicity via transplacental exposure.
Risk-benefit impact 
• No risk has been identified from pre-clinical data.
Two Phase IV studies are on-going to assess exposure during pregnancy and 
lactation. To date no risk has been identified. (12) However, data is limited.

Identified Risk 
Potential mechanism 
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis  
Potential mechanisms for infusion associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis include:  
• Immunoglobulin E mediated.
• Immunoglobulin G mediated with complement activation.
• Cytokine release but the mechanism is unclear.
• Nonspecific immunogenic mechanism not understood to date.
• Direct stimulation of mast cells by drug with release of histamine.
• Related to higher infusion rate, ie, protein load.
Possible factors associated with the induction of IgG antibodies to laronidase: 
• Foreignness of laronidase (recognized as a non-self-protein which is impacted by
genotype), chemical complexity, route, frequency, rate of infusion, and dose of
administration.
Induction of the antibody response involves the following steps: 
• Immune recognition-antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex
molecule is recognized as non-self by the immunocompetent cells.
• Stimulation of B-lymphocyte response by complex interactions between T, B and
accessory cells.
• Continuing proliferation and differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells by several
cytokines.
In theory, the binding of IgG to laronidase may potentially affect its pharmacokinetics, its 
tissue and cell distribution (enzyme redirected to Fc receptors-expressing cells such as 
white blood cells) and/or its cellular uptake (inhibition of cellular uptake mediated by 
mannose-6-phosphate, mannose and asialoglycoprotein receptors). 
Identified Risk 
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis  
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterization of the risk 
Data from clinical trials, postmarketing data, literature. 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
All IARs are considered related and constitute the majority of the related AEs in the 
clinical trials. Infusion-associated reactions were experienced by 53% of the patients in 
the Phase 3 study (treated for up to 4 years) and 35% of the patients in the under 5 study 
(up to 1 year of treatment). The most frequent ADRs were: headache, nausea, 
abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia, back pain, pain at extremity, flushing, pyrexia, infusion 
site reactions, blood pressure increased, oxygen saturation decreased, tachycardia and 
chills.  
Postmarketing experience of IARs revealed reporting of cyanosis, hypoxia, tachypnoea, 
pyrexia, vomiting, chills and erythema, in which some of these reactions were severe. 
Severity and nature of risk: 
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis are defined as 
any related AE occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (or up to 
24 hours).  
As with any IV protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. The 
majority of AEs associated with laronidase infusions were mild to moderate in severity. 
The onset of hypersensitivity related symptoms generally occurred during or shortly after 
infusions. 
The majority of the related AEs in the clinical trials were classified as IARs, experienced 
by 53% of the patients in the Phase 3 study (treated for up to 4 years) and 35% of the 
patients in the under 5 study (up to 1 year of treatment). Some of the IARs were severe. 
Over time the number of these reactions decreased.  
The most SARs reported with laronidase treatment during clinical trials were anaphylactic 
and allergic reactions. The frequency of infusion reactions decreased over time with 
continued use of laronidase. 
Severe IARs have been reported in patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper 
airway involvement. Patients with an acute underlying illness at the time of laronidase 
infusion appear to be at greater risk for IARs. 
A single patient with pre-existing airway compromise developed a severe reaction 
3 hours from the start of the infusion (at week 62 of treatment) consisting of urticaria and 
airway obstruction, requiring tracheostomy.  
Postmarketing experience has shown a similar pattern of AEs and according to this the 
risk-benefit profile of laronidase has not changed since product approval in 2003. 
Seriousness/outcomes: 
The majority of AEs associated with laronidase infusions reported in patients were 
non-serious. In most cases involving serious hypersensitivity reactions, the patients 
recovered, and there were no sequelae. 
Background incidence/prevalence: 
Infusion-associated reaction including hypersensitivity are specific to the biologic product 
and do not occur in untreated patients with MPS I disease. 
Impact on individual patient: 
Treatment interruption or possible discontinuation. 
Risk factors and risk groups  The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of IARs, 
although the onset of IARs typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.

severe underlying upper airway involvement. Patients with an acute underlying illness at 
the time of laronidase infusion appear to be at greater risk for IARs. 
• Avoid use in patients with an acute underlying illness.
• Infuse laronidase only in appropriate clinical setting (with available resuscitation
equipment) for patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper airway involvement.
• Discontinue the infusion immediately if severe allergic-type hypersensitivity occurs.
• Avoid using epinephrin (for a severe hypersensitivity reaction) in MPS I patients (as
these patients may have underlying coronary artery disease).
• Minimize the potential occurrence of IARs with initial administration of ALDURAZYME
or upon re-administration following interruption of treatment by using pre-treatment
medicines (antihistamines and/or antipyretics) approximately 60 minutes prior to the
start of the infusion.
• Manage IARs (mild to moderate) by slowing the rate of infusion and by (pre-) treating
the patient with antihistamines and/or antipyretics.
• Reduce the infusion rate to 1/2 - 1/4 the rate of the infusion at which the reaction
occurred.
• Consider desensitization procedure to ALDURAZYME in patients with severe
hypersensitivity.
Increased morbidity in case of severe hypersensitivity/ anaphylaxis.  
Additionally, severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions may lead to treatment 
interruption or possible discontinuation. If laronidase must be discontinued, there will be 
a major impact on QoL due to lack of therapeutic benefit (for the non-neurological 
manifestations of MPS I) as no other medicine is currently approved to treat MPS I. 
Unlikely due to rarity of the disease.

Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
There is potential for human/HCP error in the HI setting when administering the 
product (inappropriate dosage - underdosage or overdosage, inappropriate product 
reconstitution, inappropriate rate of infusion). 
Real-world data from 2 medical and pharmacy insurance claims databases were 
retrospectively analyzed to assess the safety of laronidase infusions administered in 
a hospital or outpatient clinic and in patients’ homes. These data were used to 
compare rates of AEs and IARs in hospital/clinic and in home settings in patients 
receiving laronidase infusions from 01-Jan-2007 to 30-Sep-2018. Thirteen of 
30 (43%) patients in the 
database A and 14 of 87 (56%) in the 
database B with a diagnosis code for MPS I and treatment claims for 
n = 24; 9141 person-days of 
n = 55; 19 295 person-days of exposure). (13) 
laronidase received infusions at home. Adverse events were identified from diagnosis 
codes in claims for up to 30 days after HIs (
exposure, 
According to analysis of this Real-world data review, the nature and incidence of AEs 
and IARs were similar for hospital/clinic and HIs and were consistent with the known 
documented safety profile of laronidase. 
In addition, a thorough postmarketing review of the Global safety database (for a 
period of 5 years +, which included follow-up cases for reports received during the 
5-year period) was performed and reported medication error data were characterized

in section below. There are limitations to this review like incomplete reporting through 
the voluntary, spontaneous nature of the AE reports in the postmarketing experience. 
Also, consistent tracking of information on administration settings has only been 
established recently. The HI data field was implemented on 01-Oct-2019; further, on 
24-Nov-2022 changes were implemented in the AEGIS user manual for better
capturing information of laronidase administration in the home setting.
patient was hospitalized for a central catheter change, 
A comparative pharmacovigilance analysis of all reported AEs and recorded 
administration settings was performed, which included comparison between the 
settings: hospital (HI data field = No) versus HI (HI data field = Yes) versus unknown 
and missing setting (HI data field = unknown plus HI data field = blank), for events 
reported during period from 01-Jan-2018 through 31-Dec-2022. This review involved 
limited data as retrieval and categorization of cases was based on the HI database 
field, which was created on 01-Oct-2019. 
Eight thousand nine hundred and seventy eight events (2566 cases) were received 
during the review period of 01-Jan-2018 to 31-Dec-2022. Infusion in a home setting 
was recorded in 565 events (160 cases). 
Of the retrievable cases (based on the HI database field), medication errors were 
reported at a similar frequency in the HI and the “no home infusion” groups 
(around 3% of the AEs) and less frequently than in the “unknown/missing” 
group (approximately 6%).  
The majority of the medication errors (for the 3 groups, including the unknown and 
missing category (HI status = unknown plus HI status = blank data field groups) were 
non-serious events. For the AEs reported during or after COVID-19 pandemic period, 
categorized as unknown and missing category, all the medication error events were 
non-serious. 
Regarding the HI group, only one serious medication error was reported, and the 
medication error event was not related to product laronidase 
(
PT: Device Malfunction).  
Most of the medication errors were related to Inappropriate schedule of product 
administration (patients receiving ALDURAZYME on alternate weeks or interval 
greater than a week) or Incorrect dose administered. There was a similar pattern 
between AEs reported in patients infused at home and patients not infused at home. 
The most frequent medication error type involved patients who were receiving 
laronidase on alternate weeks instead of weekly (recommended administration). 
Regarding potential higher dosage risk, a postmarketing case (of infusion related 
reactions) involving higher (than recommended) rate of infusion has been identified 
and it reported adverse reactions including nausea, abdominal pain, headache, 
dizziness and dyspnea. 
Further analysis was performed on case narratives of HI data field status = blank 
(N = 2146 cases, corresponding to 6933 AEs) to identify potential HI cases. A total of 
66 cases corresponding to 233 events were retrieved. There were 8 medication 
errors reported in this subgroup, all were non-serious events. 
Overall, no new signals or safety concerns were identified from the initial review 
(Safety evaluation report laronidase and use in home setting) which was based on 
the HI status entered in the HI data field of AE global information 
system/pharmacovigilance database.  
And, similarly, no new signals or safety concerns were identified from an additional 
review of case-narratives for cases categorized as “HI status = blank” which showed 
terms indicating potential HI administration. However, given the nature and inherent 
limitations of postmarketing experience, as well as recent implementation of better

tracking of HI setting in the cases, caution should be exercised when interpreting the 
data and more data will increase the robustness of the conclusions. 
Overall, based on 2 observational studies and the postmarketing data review, no new 
safety concerns were identified. The risk-benefit appears to be unaltered when 
laronidase is used in accordance with the recommendations for its use.  
The impact of a potential medication error is anticipated to be greater in the following 
patient groups: 
• Patients who did not tolerate well previous laronidase infusion.
• Patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper airway involvement.
• Patients with an acute underlying illness appear to be at greater risk for IARs and
should not receive HI.
Recommendations regarding HI administration are described in the SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 6.6 with detailed instruction on risk mitigation including eligibility of 
patients for HI, and on reconstitution, dose calculation, infusion preparation and 
administration. 
Measures to prevent anaphylactic reactions or shock in a home setting: 
• Home infusion should not be recommended for patients who have not tolerated
prior infusions or developed severe hypersensitivity/IAR.
• Utilize preventive measures recommended for product prior to infusions.
The MAH plans to mitigate the occurrence of medication errors and prevent severe 
IARs by providing a home infusion guide to HCPs wherein recommendations on 
patients’ eligibility for HI and proper conditions of HI (in terms of equipment, 
pretreatment, and emergency treatments) are emphasized. Furthermore, only 
qualified HCP should perform HI.  
Infusion-associated reactions could be prevented by using pre-medication and by 
following infusion rates recommended per product labeling. Appropriate medical 
support, including personnel trained in emergency measures, should be readily 
available on site when laronidase is administered. 
The benefit-risk impact should be weighed against the underlying risk/natural history 
of the conditions of the MPS I patients and the burden on the patient’s life and health 
care systems.  
Only qualified HCPs should conduct HI. Patient’s eligibility for HI and product usage 
recommendations should be strictly followed. Benefit-risk should not be altered if 
guidance is followed. 
Public health impact 
Not anticipated if HI is well managed (there should be fewer patient hospitalizations 
and less missed weekly laronidase administrations, more QoL for the patients).

Infants may be at risk of toxicity from drugs used by adults; toxicity may occur prenatally 
when they are exposed via placental transfer or postnatally when exposed through breast 
milk. 
The first trimester of pregnancy involves major development/embryofetal organogenesis; 
it is a critical period for drug toxicity via transplacental exposure. 
Animal studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, 
embryonal/fetal development, parturition, and postnatal development. 
There has been no risk (related to exposure during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding) 
identified from a cumulative review of global safety data and literature. 
To date the pregnancy sub-registry (ALID04911) and lactation (ALID01803) studies have

POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
III.1
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES 
No routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection are 
deemed necessary to monitor the risks of laronidase. 
The safety profile of laronidase will continue to be further characterized in real clinical conditions 
of use through postmarketing safety surveillance, encompassing analysis of spontaneous reporting 
of ADRs in periodic safety reports, product technical complaints (PTCs) relating to AEs, and signal 
detection. 
III.2
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES 
The MAH has set up a pregnancy sub registry (ALID04911) and lactation study (ALID01803) to 
optimize the collection of data on laronidase use during pregnancy and breast-feeding, and 
document cases appropriately.

Study short name and title 
Lactation study (ALID01803) 
Rationale and study objectives 
The objective of this study is to determine whether laronidase affects lactation in women with MPS I disease by: 
• Determining whether laronidase activity is present in the breast milk of mothers with MPS I disease who are being
treated with laronidase during lactation.
• Determining whether laronidase affects the growth, development, and immunologic response of breastfed infants born
to mothers with MPS I disease who are being treated with laronidase during lactation.
Study design 
Multicenter, multinational, open-label study of the effects of ALDURAZYME treatment on lactation in women with MPS I 
and their breastfed infants. 
Study populations 
Mothers treated with ALDURAZYME who intend to breastfeed their infants while receiving ALDURAZYME will be eligible 
for enrollment into this study. Mothers being treated with ALDURAZYME infusion during lactation will have to provide 
signed written informed consent for themselves and their infants prior to any protocol-related procedures being performed. 
Consent for all infants enrolled in the study will be obtained from the infant’s legally authorized guardian. If a mother is 
younger than 18 years of age, consent for mother and infant will be obtained from the legal guardian. 
Milestones 
Final report: Q3 2024 
Due to the rarity of the disease and the complexity of the study, only one patient was recruited and completed the study. 
The study will remain opened pending FDA assessment and agreement to close it.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for ALDURAZYME (Laronidase) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ALDURAZYME. The RMP details 
important risks of ALDURAZYME, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about ALDURAZYME’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ALDURAZYME’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how ALDURAZYME 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ALDURAZYME should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ALDURAZYME’s RMP. 
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ALDURAZYME is authorized for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I; α-L-iduronidase deficiency) to treat 
the non-neurological manifestations of the disease. It contains laronidase as the active substance and 
it is given by intravenous (IV) route.  
Further information about the evaluation of ALDURAZYME’s benefits can be found in 
ALDURAZYME’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/aldurazyme 
II.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of ALDURAZYME, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about ALDURAZYME’s risks, are outlined in the next sections. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of ALDURAZYME, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ALDURAZYME is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of ALDURAZYME are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of ALDURAZYME. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine 
Data from clinical trials, postmarketing data, literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the 
incidence of IARs, although the onset of IARs typically coincided with 
the formation of IgG antibodies. Severe infusion associated reactions 
have been reported in patients with pre-existent severe underlying 
upper airway involvement. Patients with an acute underlying illness at 
the time of laronidase infusion appear to be at greater risk for IARs.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Real-world data from 2 medical and pharmacy insurance claims 
databases were retrospectively analyzed to assess the safety of 
laronidase infusions administered in a hospital or outpatient clinic and 
in patients’ homes. These data were used to compare rates of AEs 
and IARs in hospital/clinic and in home settings in patients receiving 
laronidase infusions from 01-Jan-2007 to 30-Sep-2018. Thirteen of 
30 (43%) patients in the 
database A and 14 of 
87 (56%) in the 
MPS I and treatment claims for laronidase received infusions at home. 
Adverse events were identified from diagnosis codes in claims for up 
n = 24; 9141 person-days of exposure, 
to 30 days after HIs (
database B with a diagnosis code for 
n = 55; 19 295 person-days of exposure). (13) 
According  to  analysis  of  this  Real-world  data  review,  the  nature  and 
incidence of AEs and IARs were similar for hospital/clinic and HIs and 
were consistent with the known documented safety profile of laronidase. 
In addition, a thorough postmarketing review of the Global safety 
database (for a period of 5 years +, which included follow-up cases for 
reports received during the 5-year period) was performed and reported 
medication error data were characterized in section below.  
There are limitations to this review like incomplete reporting through 
the voluntary, spontaneous nature of the AE reports in the 
postmarketing experience, Also, consistent tracking of information on 
administration settings has only been established recently. The HI data 
field was implemented on 01-Oct-2019; further, on 24-Nov-2022 
changes were implemented in the AEGIS user manual for better 
capturing information of laronidase administration in the home setting. 
The impact of a potential medication error is anticipated to be greater 
in the following patient groups: 
• Patients who did not tolerate well previous laronidase infusion.
• Patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper airway
involvement.
• Patients with an acute underlying illness appear to be at greater risk
for IARs and should not receive HI.

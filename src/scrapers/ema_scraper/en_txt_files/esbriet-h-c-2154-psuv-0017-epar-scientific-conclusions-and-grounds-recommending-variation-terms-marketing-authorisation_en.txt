Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Esbriet, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
The PRAC considers the balance of risks and benefits is unchanged compared with the previous 
period of review and remains positive.  
The MAH provided some details of open-label extension study PIPF-012 which provided supporting 
evidence for the benefits shown in studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 considered by the CHMP at the 
time of licensing. No new safety signals were identified in this PSUR and the interim report of the 
post-marketing safety study PASSPORT did not highlight any new safety concerns. The most 
commonly-reported ADRs during the period of review were those listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
(Undesirable effects). Some recently-reported cases of elevations in hepatic function tests which 
met ‘Hy’s law’ criteria provided additional definition of an established signal of elevated hepatic 
enzymes (AST, ALT, and GGT). These cases appear to have been managed in accordance with 
product information and clinical trial protocols. The MAH considers that this signal is ongoing; and 
this is supported. The MAH has agreed with the Rapporteur’s recommendation that updates to 
section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC are required to reflect the reported cases of elevated total serum 
bilirubin in conjunction with elevated ALT/AST. The MAH has also agreed to update the PIL to inform 
patients of liver-related symptoms to be aware of. 
The next PSUR should be submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Esbriet, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance PIRFENIDONE is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a progressive disease and the most common cause of dementia. From 
epidemiological studies, it is estimated that there are over three million individuals with dementia in 
the European Union, and of these about 70% have Alzheimer Disease. 
Prometax is currently approved for Alzheimer Disease in the European Union (EU) as oral formulations 
and transdermal patches. 
The Prometax oral formulations (capsules and oral solution) are indicated in the symptomatic 
treatment of the mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia and symptomatic treatment of mild 
to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (EMEA/H/C/169/II/33). 
The once daily Prometax transdermal patches were approved in EU for the symptomatic treatment of 
mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia on 19 July2007 (EMEA/H/C/169/X/39). 
Prometax

The transdermal formulation is available in two sizes (5 cm2 and 10 cm2 patch). The 5 cm2 patch 
contains 9 mg drug load of rivastigmine base with a nominal delivery rate of 4.6 mg/24 hours. The 10 
cm2 patch contains 18 mg drug load with a nominal delivery rate of 9.5 mg/24 hours. 
Therapy is initiated with the 4.6 mg/24 hours dosage strength and after a minimum of four weeks of 
treatment and if well tolerated, this dose should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 hours, which is the 
recommended maintenance dose. 
Novartis submitted on 1 December 2011 an application for an extension of the Marketing Authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Prometax (13.3 mg/24 h) grouped with a safety type II 
variation. 
Prometax transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24h (15 cm2) is intended to be used in the same indication if the 
treating physician considers that increasing the dose could give an additional therapeutic benefit. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as a new strength of 15 cm2 transdermal patches containing 27.0 mg, of 
rivastigmine base as active substance, and designed to release approximately 13.3 mg per 24 hours. 
Each transdermal patch is a thin, matrix-type transdermal patch consisting of three layers: 
- Backing layer: polyethylene terephthalate film, lacquered. 
- Medicinal product matrix: alpha-tocopherol, poly(butylmethacrylate, methyl-methacrylate), acrylic 
copolymer. 
- Adhesive matrix: alpha-tocopherol, silicone oil, dimethicone. 
- Release liner: polyester film, fluoropolymer-coated. 
The finished patches are individually packaged a in child-resistant sachet made of a 
paper/polyester/aluminium/polyacrylonitrile multi-laminated material. One sachet contains one 
transdermal patch. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The drug substance used in the 13.3mg/24h (15cm2) transdermal patch, rivastigmine base, is the 
same chemical entity as that approved for the currently authorised transdermal patches. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim is to develop an additional strength of 13.3mg/24h (size 15cm2) to the currently approved 
lower doses namely 4.6mg/24h (size 5cm2) and 9.5mg/24h (size 10cm2). 
The composition is proportional to the already approved strengths. All components are already 
registered for the approved strengths. The manufacturing process is the same as the one in the 
authorised strengths. 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 6/44 
 
 
 
 
All excipients used for the new transdermal patch strength are already used in the authorised 
strengths. Except minors changes in the specifications, update of silicone oil according to Ph Eur 
monograph, or in the method, update of the method for silicone pressure sensitive adhesive to include 
a change in the specification for appearance, all the data have been already assessed and approved for 
the current patch strengths. 
The new strength is packaged in heat-sealed, child-resistant pouches made of multi-layer composite 
laminate consisting of paper bonded to polyethylene terephthalate and aluminum, with an inner-
sealing layer of polyacrylnitrile-copolymer. The packaging components are identical to the currently 
approved laminate used for the currently approved strengths. Quality specifications and test 
procedures are described. The foil laminate pouch is tested for appearance, identity by IR, dimensions 
as well as sealed seam force. Reference IR spectra are provided. The packaging complies with 
European Directive 2002/72/ECincl amendment 2004/19 relating to plastic materials and articles 
intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of this new strength. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is the same as for the currently marketed 4.6mg/24h (size 5cm2) and 
9.5mg/24h (size 10cm2) transdermal patches. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing process. The in process controls are adequate. 
Three full-scale production batches data show that the patches can be manufactured reproducibly 
according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this transdermal 
preparation. 
Product specification 
The product specifications include tests by validated methods for appearance, identification  (HPLC, 
TLC), peel force, adhesion force, release rate (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
microbial enumeration test, uniformity of content (HPLC), assay of rivastigmine (90.0-110.0%, HPLC), 
and assay of D,L-α-tocopherol  (80.0 – 110.0%, HPLC).  
Degradation products are controlled and their limits are justified by reference to stability studies and 
toxicology studies. 
The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality 
of the finished product for their intended purpose. 
Batch analysis data confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. 
Stability of the product 
A bracketed and matrix design was used for the registration stability studies. In this design, the 4.6 
mg/24h, 9.5 mg/24 h and a no authorised strength are studied and the 13.3 mg/24h system is 
bracketed. The 4.6 mg/24h and 9.5 mg/24 h are the currently approved patch strengths; the data 
from the no approved strength is considered as supportive data. 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 7/44 
 
 
 
Most of the stability data have already been provided for the approved strengths. Those data are 
remain with an update of stability results up to 48 months for the registration batches. 
Stability data of 2 batches stored for 18 months at ICH long term storage condition of 30°C/65%RH 
and alternate long term storage condition of 30°C/75%RH (climatic zones III and IV) was provided for 
the 13.3 mg/24h proposed strength. The batches were tested for appearance, assay of rivastignine 
and tocopherol, related substances, release rate, adhesive forces, peel forces, and microbial tests. 
Peel force is the stability limiting characteristic, limiting the currently approved finished product shelf-
life at 25°C/60%RH to 24 months. 
Based on the available data the same shelf life and storage condition as already granted for the 
approved strengths is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance manufacture and control is the same as that reviewed for the already authorised 
patch strengths. 
The development of the formulation and manufacturing process for the active substance and finished 
product are essentially the same and has been performed with a focus on to the critical variables that 
could affect the efficacy and safety of the product. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The CHMP considered the quality of this product to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Rivastigmine is considered a well-known inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl 
cholinesterase (BChE) thought to facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission in remaining cholinergic 
neurons. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of rivastigmine and its inactive major metabolite NAP226-90 after 
administration of Prometax patch have been well characterised in adequate studies at time of approval 
of the transdermal patches currently marketed. 
Regarding the absorption upon dermal doses, the Tmax of rivastigmine of 18-24 hours indicated a slow 
release of rivastigmine from patch to the skin and/or slow dermal absorption. The AUC-ratio of the 
primary metabolite NAP226-90 to rivastigmine was 0.24 for the intravenous dose, as compared to 
about 200 for the oral dose. For the dermal doses, the ratio was 0.3-0.5. Data demonstrated the 
strong first-pass effect after oral administration and the virtual absence of first-pass metabolism after 
dermal administration. 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 8/44 
 
 
 
The results of the in vitro studies indicated that rivastigmine is not metabolised to a significant extent 
in the dermal compartment. It seems therefore unlikely that novel metabolites would be formed in 
human skin during treatment with the patch formulation. Rivastigmine and its main metabolite 
NAP226-90 did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9/10, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5 up to concentrations of 
200 µM.  
No new primary or secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted for the current 
application. For the current application inhibition studies with CYP2B6 were conducted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The in vitro study submitted show no or a weak CYP2B6 inhibition up to 200 µM of rivastigmine and 
NAP226-90. Given that the average systemic concentrations of rivastigmine ranges from 2.71 ng/mL 
(5 cm2) to 19.5 ng/mL (20 cm2), a clinically relevant interaction with a CYP2B6 substrate 
(e.g.bupropion, methadone, efavirenz) is not expected. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of Prometax Transdermal patches has been well characterised at the time of 
approval of the already marketed transdermal patches. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies, mainly using dermal administration were performed in the mouse (up 
to 13 weeks), rat (up to 4 weeks), rabbit (up to 4 weeks) and minipig (up to 26 weeks duration). The 
studies in the most relevant animal species based on skin texture, the minipig, were performed with 
the formulation proposed for marketing, the SDZ ENA 713 patch, and are considered pivotal. The 
studies in mice, rats and rabbits are considered less important. 
Following dermal application of the patch proposed for marketing, the SDZ ENA 713 patch, no signs of 
systemic toxicity were detected. A dose-related decrease in acetylcholinesteras levels was noted, 
explained by the pharmacodynamic action of rivastigmine. Local signs evident as erythema, but no 
oedema, was observed in all animals (3/sex/group), also in those treated with control patches. 
Macroscopically, a slight to moderate thickened and/or reddened skin was noted and dermatitis was 
found at the microscopic evaluation of all treated animals including those with control patches. In light 
of the similar distribution of adverse local reactions between treated and control animals, the 
erythema/dermatitis were assessed as probably caused by the composition of the patch and not by the 
active substance itself. This conclusion is supported by the observation that increased rotation of patch 
application sites reduced inflammation and that there was no dose-relationship for dermatitis in 
minipigs. Further, as the minipig is a species with a skin texture considered fairly similar to humans, 
local reaction in human skin would be anticipated. 
Toxicokinetic data obtained following dermal administration (solution or patches) in the 26 week 
minipig study demonstrated a Cmax of 2.9±0.6 ng/ml in males and 2.9±1.0 ng/ml in females and an 
AUC of 48±16 ng*h/ml in males and 43±14 ng*h/ml in females. In humans for a 15 cm2 patch with a 
maximum anticipated daily dose of rivastigmine of 13.3 mg Cmax was determined to 14.1±6.30 
ng*h/ml and AUC to 233±83.2 ng*h/ml. Thus, there is no margin to human exposure. Higher dosage 
in the minipig toxicology studies were not considered feasible due to local reactions. This is considered 
acceptable. 
No genotoxicity studies were performed. Considering that rivastigmine is a well-known substance with 
a previously investigated negative genotoxicity profile, the absence of new studies was considered 
acceptable. 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 9/44 
 
 
 
A dermal carcinogenicity study in mice with daily administration of rivastigmine 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 
mg/kg dissolved in ethyl alcohol solution demonstrated no carcinogenic potential. The palpable masses 
sporadically observed in female mice both in treated and control animals were not considered 
treatment related. Oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats did not demonstrate a carcinogenic 
potential of rivastigmine. No systemic or local adverse events in relation to treatment were observed in 
the oral carcinogenicity studies. The toxicokinetic evaluation of the dermal carcinogenicity study 
demonstrated exposure in a fairly dose-related manner to rivastigmine and its main metabolite ZNS 
114-666. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies by the dermal route were not carried out because a 
complete package was conducted in rats and rabbits with rivastigmine tartrate using the oral route of 
administration. These studies conducted with rivastigmine tartrate gave no evidence of a teratogenic 
potential for rivastigmine. A slightly prolonged duration of gestation in post- and perinatal studies in 
rats, although considered too small to be of biological relevance, nethertheless was consistently 
recorded and may be a sequel to cholinergic stimulation. 
Juvenile toxicity studies were not conducted with trans-dermal system using rivastigmine. 
A large number of local tolerance studies using relevant animal models of acute dermal irritation, 
contact hypersensitivity, delayed contact hypersensitivity and primary skin irritation demonstrated 
rivastigmine to be non-irritant to animal skin. Furthermore, no allergenic and sensitization potential of 
rivastigmine was observed. Primary eye irritation studies demonstrated rivastigmine to be irritating to 
the rabbit eye. Therefore, patient or the caretaking person should avoid contact with eyes after 
handling of the patch. Section 4.4 of the transdermal patches formulations has been updated to 
specifically mention what to do in case of contact with eyes in the current “other warnings and 
precautions” sub-section. 
The performed phototoxicity study did not demonstrate any phototoxic potential of the rivastigmine 
dermal patch. 
Regarding the excipients, non-novel excipients have been used for the patches in this application. 
2.3.4.  Environmental risk assessment 
No new environmental risk assessment was provided for this application. 
The MAH considers that an environmental risk assessment is not necessary for the current line 
extension, based on the fact that the introduction of the 15 cm2 patch on the European market will not 
lead to a significantly increased use of rivastigmine. 
The MAH submitted the justification of use of the STP modelling with the SimpleTreat model and 
includes a refinement of the PECsurface water and PECsediment in the Phase II Tier B assessment. 
Rivastigmine is not expected to bio-accumulate in aquatic species according to the screening criteria 
for bioaccumulation. Adsorption of rivastigmine to sewage sludge is low and therefore partitioning into 
the soil compartment via spreading of sludge on agricultural soils is not expected. The highest 
respective risk ratio has been found for the sediment compartment (PEC/PNECsediment) with 0.0026. 
Based on these informations available, rivastigmine does not present environmental risk and the CHMP 
considered the justification for the absence to be acceptable.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new preclinical data has been included for this line extension except for one in vitro inhibition study 
with CYP2B6. This study did not indicate a relevant inhibition of CYP2B6 at concentrations up to 200 
µM (the highest concentration tested). 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the application for Prometax transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24 h is approvable 
from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Prometax patches, 4,6mg/24 h and 9.5 mg24 h were approved with the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/169/X/39 in July 2007. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine and its metabolite NAP226-90 following Prometax Patch 15 
cm2 (13.3mg/24hr) was fully characterized in both healthy volunteers and AD patients, together with 
the other three Prometax Patch strengths (5 cm2, 10 cm2 and 20 cm2) at time of approval of the 
already marketed transdermal formulation [Study D2331]. (Summary of results in Section 2.4.2)  
The clinical package presented included a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-
dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group study of the once-daily Prometax 10 cm2 and 
20 cm2 patch and the Prometax capsule 6 mg bid in patients with probable AD [Study D2320]. 
This study included four treatment arms (placebo, once daily 10 cm2 patch, once daily 20 cm2 patch 
and 6mg/bid oral capsules) and consisted of a 16-week titration period and an 8-week maintenance 
period. 
The 15 cm2 dose was used as a titration dose for the 20 cm2 treatment arm and not evaluated as a 
randomized dose. Exposure to the 15cm2 dose was for 4-weeks during which time no efficacy 
assessments were performed. 
A risk benefit ratio for the 15 cm2 dosage strength could not be determined and according to the 
available data the 20 cm2 patch was not approvable due to an unfavourable risk benefit ratio. 
For the current application a new clinical study was submitted [Study CENA713D2340]. 
GCP 
The clinical trials included in the application were performed, according to the Applicant, in accordance 
with the “Declaration of Helsinki” as adopted by the 48th World Medical Assembly held in Somerset 
West in 1996 and with the laws and regulations of the country in which the studies were conducted. 
All studies have been conducted in compliance with ICH E6 guidelines on GCP implemented in the EU 
by 2005/28/EC as claimed by the applicant. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study D2331 was an open-label, parallel group, ascending (titration) dose proportionality study 
evaluating the Prometax 5 cm2, 10 cm2, 15 cm2, and 20 cm2  once daily dose transdermal patches

and 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg, and 6 mg twice daily dose capsules at steady state in patients with mild-to 
moderate Alzheimer’s disease. 
Patients were randomized to receive either patch or capsule. A total of 25 patients were randomized to 
receive Prometax patch treatment, 13 patch patients completed all 4 study periods. A total of 26 
patients were randomized to receive Prometax capsule treatment, 17 completed all 4 study periods. 
The results for 25 patch-treated patients showed that after application of the patches, rivastigmine 
plasma concentrations rose slowly to reach peak concentrations at a median tmax of 8.0 h. Average 
Cmax observed ranged from 2.71 ng/mL (5 cm2) to 19.5 ng/mL (20 cm2); for the 15 cm2 patch 
average Cmax was 14.1 ng/mL. Average AUC after 24h was in the range of 46.3 ng•h/mL (5 cm2) to 
345 ng•h/mL (20 cm2); for the 15 cm2 patch average AUC after 24h 233 ng•h/mL. Elimination half-
life of rivastigmine from plasma, on average, was 3.37 h (t½ was available only for the 20 cm2 patch). 
Exposure to rivastigmine (AUC) increased over-proportionally with rising doses after dermal 
applications. As assessed by compartmental analysis [Modeling and Simulation Report for Study 
D2331], on escalating through the patch sizes of 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm2, the increase in rivastigmine 
exposure relative to the lowest dose (5 cm2) was 2.6, 4.9 and 7.8 fold for the 10, 15 and 20 cm2 
patch, respectively. However, the deviation from dose-proportionality was less apparent than with oral 
rivastigmine, and the increase in exposure (AUC) with rising patch size from 10 cm2 to 15 cm2 (i.e. 
1.5-fold) was 1.8-fold, indicating an increase close to linearity. 
The fluctuation index (i.e. measure of peak/trough fluctuation) was in the range of 0.57 to 0.77 for the 
patch, demonstrating a low fluctuation between peak and trough concentrations with the patch. 
The inter-patient variability in the exposure parameters of rivastigmine (Cmax and AUC 24h) as 
assessed by the coefficients of variation (CVs) was of 33-45%. 
Relationship between rivastigmine exposure at steady state and bodyweight was observed also 
observed.  With this regard Section 4.2 of the SmPC of transdermal patches has been updated to 
recommend careful titration in patients with a low body weight (< 50 kg). In addition, no specific 
studies in special populations (renal and hepatic impairment) or interaction studies have been 
performed with the transdermal patches consequently recommendations on the use of the patch in the 
mentioned special population have been introduced in relevant sections of the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Plasma concentrations rose slowly after the application of the patch until plateau concentrations is 
reached at Tmax of approximately 8 hours with all strengths. From the obtained study it appears 
clearly that systemic exposure to rivastigmine evolves not linearly with the dose. AUC increased over 
than proportionally with increasing doses. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Rivastigmine was well released from the transdermal system over 24 hours dermal application period 
with approximately 50% of the drug load released from the system, which is in full agreement with 
release rates of the other patch sizes. The Mean Content Uniformity of Batch (loaded dose) for the 15 
cm2 patch is 27 mg. The nominal delivery rate was calculated to be 13.3 mg per 24 h.

Baseline for the Initial open-label (IOL) treatment phase was Day 1 prior to first dose. Baseline for the Double-blind 
(DB) treatment phase was the DB randomization day.  
Additional  visits  were  allowed  for  patients  without  demonstrated  functional  and  cognitive  decline  during  IOL 
maintenance visits. Patients randomized to the DB treatment phase began treatment with DB medication on the day 
following randomization. Down-titration was allowed as required to address tolerability problems.

Prometax 15 cm2 and Prometax 10 cm2 patch doses were selected for evaluation during the 48-week, 
randomized, double-blind phase. The daily Prometax 10 cm2 dose and regimen was in accordance with 
product labelling. The selection of the Prometax 15 cm2 once daily dose was based on the results of 
data previously submitted. 
Methods 
-  Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: The study population consisted of patients between 50 and 85 years of age with 
a diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria in addition to a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s 
disease according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and 
Stroke/Alzheimer’s disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria, and an initial 
open-label (IOL) baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 10-24, corresponding to mild 
to moderate dementia.

Treatments 
During the IOL phase, patients who demonstrated decline during the 24-48 week treatment at the 
approved maintenance dose of Prometax 10 cm2 were eligible for enrolment into the double-blind (DB) 
treatment period, and were randomized equally into 1 of the 2 treatment arms. Decline during the IOL 
phase was defined as: functional decline (investigator judgment) and cognitive decline (a decrease of 
at least 2 points in the MMSE score from the previous visit or at least 3 points from the IOL-baseline). 
Patients were required to meet both criteria prior to randomization into the DB phase. Patients who did 
not fulfil the criteria for decline during the IOL phase were offered continued treatment with Prometax 
10 cm2 in the extended open-label (EOL) phase. 
-  Objectives and outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective was to compare the efficacy of target Prometax 10 cm2 patch vs. target 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch in patients who have demonstrated cognitive decline in the initial open-label 
(IOL) phase (Prometax 10 cm2 patch) with respect to: 
• The change from DB randomization baseline to Week 48 of the DB phase in cognition as assessed by 
the ADAS-cog subscale, 
• The change from DB randomization baseline to Week 48 of the DB phase in instrumental activities of 
daily living as assessed by the ADCS-Instrumental ADL subscale. 
The secondary efficacy objective was to compare the efficacy of target Prometax 10 cm2 patch vs. 
target Prometax 15 cm2 patch in patients who have demonstrated cognitive decline in the IOL phase 
(Prometax 10 cm2 patch) with respect to: 
• 
• 
• 
The time to functional decline (i.e. interval between DB randomization baseline to first decline from 
DB randomization baseline) in instrumental activities of daily living as assessed by the ADCS-
Instrumental ADL subscale over the 48-Week DB phase; 
The change from DB randomization baseline to Week 48 of the DB phase in attention and 
executive function as assessed by the Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B; 
The change from DB randomization baseline over the 48-Week DB phase in neuropsychiatric 
symptoms as assessed by the 10-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10). 
The safety objective of Study D2340 was to compare the safety and tolerability of target Prometax 15 
cm2 patch vs. target Prometax 10 cm2 patch in the DB treatment phase with respect to the incidence 
of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs. 
The assumptions on standard deviation of 8 points for the change in ADAS-cog and ADCS-Instrumental 
ADL were taken from previous long-term Prometax studies on the oral formulation. A sample size of 
410 patients per treatment group was required at the end of the DB phase to detect a treatment 
difference in means of 1.9 points on ADCS-cog and ADCS-Instrumental ADL score in the ITT population 
using a two group t-test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level. To adjust for 5% of patients who 
were not be included in the ITT population, a total of 864 patients (432 per group) were needed at the 
time of randomization (end of IOL phase). 
- 
Participants flow 
There were 1979 patients screened for this study. A total of 1571 patients were planned for enrolment 
into the IOL phase, 1582 patients were enrolled and exposed to study drug. A total of 499 
discontinued. The most commonly reported primary reasons for discontinuation were adverse events, 
withdrawal of consent, and unsatisfactory therapeutic effect.

At the end of the IOL phase, 567 patients were classified as decliners and randomised into the DB 
phase. The time to meet decline criteria for entry into the DB phase was variable, extending from 24 to 
48 weeks. Overall, the patient disposition during the DB phase was well balanced between the 
treatment groups. The Prometax 15 cm2 patch group had a lower incidence of overall discontinuations 
compared to the lower dose treatment group, driven primarily by the slightly lower incidences of 
discontinuations due to AEs. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first AE leading to 
discontinuation and time to discontinuation for any reason show no major differences in the 
discontinuation pattern over time between the treatment groups during the DB phase. Discontinuation 
due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect was reported for 4.6% of patients treated with Prometax 15 
cm2 and 4.5% of patients treated with Prometax 10 cm2. 
A total of 457 patients were entered the EOL phase and were treated with Prometax 10 cm2. Of the 
457 treated patients, 62 patients (13.6%) discontinued. 
-  Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 4 times: 
Amendment 1 related to some minor change in laboratory test schedule, SAE reporting routines, 
biomarker general sampling procedure. 
Amendment 2 was implemented at the request of Canadian Health Authority, and was specific to 
Canadian sites only. 
Amendment 3, issued after approximately 1370 patients were enrolled into the IOL treatment phase 
and 275 patients were randomized to the DB treatment phase, and was implemented based on the 
response received from the US FDA at the EOP2 meeting. It also modified study objectives to elevate 
the prior secondary objective of ADCS-Instrumental and ADL subscale as a co-primary outcome 
variable, clarified the inclusion criteria and added rater qualifications/certification performing the 
ADAS-cog. It also changed the primary analysis population from PP population to the ITT population 
and increased the sample size from 1200 to 1571 patients for the IOL treatment phase so that at least 
864 patients would be randomized to the DB treatment phase to provide sufficient power for both 
primary outcome variables. The percentage of patients who were expected to decline during the IOL 
phase and enter the DB phase was recalculated and reduced. 
Amendment 4 issued after the study recruitment was complete, 
Added an Intermediate Home/Assisted Living Questionnaire and revised the Patient Instructions to 
reinforce the importance of the proper use and application of Prometax transdermal patch =.in 
response to post-marketing reports of medication errors and inappropriate use of Prometax 
transdermal patch. 
All amendments were implemented prior to the un-blinding of study treatments for the DB phase.  
During the IOL phase, 17.7% of patients had at least 1 protocol deviation; however, only 1% of 
patients had major protocol deviations, and these consisted of 1 patient who had a treatable dementia, 
which was identified prior to the IOL phase; and 15 patients who did not meet the decline criteria 
during the IOL phase. 
During the DB phase, 9.3% of the patients had at least 1 protocol deviation, and only 1 patient had a 
major protocol deviation. PID 0204/00004 did not meet the protocol defined decline criteria) when the 
decline criteria was mistakenly compared to Visit 1 instead of baseline. This patient continued in the 
DB phase until discontinuation due to an AE.  
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 15/44 
 
 
 
Of the 457 patients included in the EOL phase, 24 patients (5.3%) had protocol deviations; however, 
none of the deviations resulted in patient exclusion from an analysis population. Drug dispensing errors 
during the EOL were reported in 3 patients, incorrect study medication or dose was reported in 4 
patients, and titration errors were reported in 1 patient. Most of these errors were due to human error. 
The protocol deviations are not considered to confound the interpretation of efficacy or safety in a 
systematic way. 
-  Baseline data  
The majority of patients who entered the IOL phase were female (62.6%) and most were more than 
65 years of age (90.2%) (Table 11-2), as is consistent with this condition. The patient population was 
predominantly Caucasian (95.5%), reflecting the populations in the participating countries. 
For the IOL phase, the baseline demographics were generally similar when comparing patients groups 
of decliners, non-decliners, and those who discontinued. The non-decliners group had a relatively 
higher proportion of male patients compared to the other groups (42.3% compared to around 35%). 
For those patients participating in the IOL, AD characteristics for patients with decline were consistent 
with a population of patients with more advanced AD, as shown by the longer mean and median 
durations since first symptoms noticed by the patient caregiver and since first symptoms was 
diagnosed by a physician, slightly lower IOL baseline mean and median MMSE scores, and higher 
proportion of patient with prior AD treatments as compared to the non-decliners. 
The majority of patients who entered the DB phase were female (64.7%) and most patients were more 
than 65 years of age (90.8%). 
Overall, the treatment groups for the DB phase were similar with respect to the DB-baseline 
demographics. The Prometax 15 cm2 group had a higher proportion of patients younger than 65 years 
of age (12.1% vs. 6.3% in the lower dose treatment group). 
For patients who entered the DB phase, the mean and median duration of time since the first AD 
symptom and since the first diagnosis by a physician were slightly shorter in the Prometax 15 cm2 
group (mean 3.86 and 1.80 years, respectively) than in the lower dose treatment group (mean 4.31 
and 2.04 years, respectively). There were no important differences in other background characteristics 
assessed. 
Mean MMSE at baseline was similar in both treatment groups (14.1 and 14.2 in the Prometax 15 cm2 
and Prometax 10 cm2 groups, respectively). At DB-baseline approximately 80% of the patients showed 
an MMSE score of 10 or above, while at the IOL baseline all but 1 patient had an MMSE score of 10 or 
above. 
For patients who were randomized into the DB period, the medical histories were generally similar to 
that of the enrolled population. In the following SOCs, the overall incidence was slightly higher (by 3-
6%) in patients treated with Prometax 15 cm2 compared to the lower dose treatment group: 
metabolism and nutrition (51.4% vs. 46.3%), vascular (61.4% vs. 55.7%), gastrointestinal (32.5% vs. 
28.9%), nervous system (30.4% vs. 27.5%), and cardiac (22.1% vs. 19.5%). The most common 
medical histories, depression (36.4% vs. 22.1%) and hypertension (56.8% vs. 51.2%) were between 
4% and 5% more prevalent in the higher dose treatment group. 
Consistent with the reported past medical histories, nearly all patients were receiving medications and 
or significant non-drug therapies prior to study enrollment. In the IOL-Safety population, the most 
common treatments were anticholinesterases, which were taken by more than half the patients. 
Donepezil was taken by 30% of patients. Nearly a third of patients were taking HMG-CoA reductase 
(statins). Memantine was also taken by 27% patients. Aspirin (salicylic acid) was also commonly used. 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report

Page 16/44 
 
 
 
Prior to study enrolment, 628 patients (39.7% of the Safety-IOL population) received treatment with 
CNS-related medications. Nearly a third of the patients were receiving antidepressant therapy, most 
commonly sertraline. Hypnotic/anxiolytics, most commonly lorazepam, were taken by approximately 
12% of patients. The use of antipsychotics was low (4.6%). 
Summary of main efficacy results  
Patients treated with the Prometax 15 cm2 patch showed a lesser decline (i.e. improved therapeutic 
benefit) in activities of daily living as measured by ADCS-Instrumental ADL subscale change from DB-
baseline at DB-week 48 (primary endpoint) when compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch. The 
differences were statistically significant. The results were similar in the ITT-OC population (2.5 (95%CI 
0.8; 4.1) p=0.004). Statistical significance was also achieved at all-time points for the PP-LOCF (2.0, 
p=0.010) and PP-OC analyses (2.1, p<0.017). 
Cognitive decline for the ITT-LOCF analysis, as measured by the mean change from DB baseline in 
ADAS-cog score, was less at each time point in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch group, and the between-treatment group differences were statistically 
significant in favour of the Prometax 15 cm2 patch at Week 24 (-1.3 points; 95% CI: -2.5,-0.2; 
p=0.027), but not at Week 48 (-0.8 points; 95% CI: -2.1 , 0.5; p=0.227), which was the primary 
endpoint. In the ITT-OC, PP-LOCF and PP-OC populations the results show a numerical superiority for 
the Prometax patch 15 cm2 group over the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group at all time-points. 
The difference between treatment group groups was not statistically significant for any of the 
secondary endpoints even if the results show a numerical superiority for the Prometax patch 15 cm2 
group over the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. 
Sub-group analyses  
Prospectively defined subgroup analyses of ADCS-Instrumental ADL data and ADAS-Cod data were 
performed to show homogeneity of treatment effects. 
The following are presented here: 
1. Change from baseline in ADCS-Instrumental ADL and ADAS-Cog score in the 48-week double-blind 
phase, by time to meet decline criteria in the initial open label phase and treatment group (ITT-DB 
population) 
2. Change from baseline in ADCS-Instrumental ADL and ADAS-Cog score in the 48-week double-blind 
phase by disease status (a) moderate AD or (b) moderate to severe AD only at double-blind baseline 
(ITT-DB population). 
The analysis of change from DB-baseline in ADCS-Instrumental ADL score showed a similar decline 
within treatment groups for patients who met the decline criteria in >36 weeks or did so in ≤ 36 weeks 
during the Initial open-label phase. The decline was less in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in 
the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group at each timepoint except Week 12 for those who met decline criteria 
in ≤ 36 weeks.  
For patients who met the decline criteria in ≤ 36 weeks, the analysis of change from DB-baseline in 
ADAS-cog score showed less decline within the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group at all time-points 
compared to those who met the decline criteria in >36 weeks. In the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group, a 
similar decline was observed for patients who met the decline criteria in ≤ 36 or in >36 weeks. At each 
time-point, regardless of whether the patients met the decline criteria in ≤ 36 weeks or in >36 weeks, 
the observed decline was less in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch 
group at all time-points.

The analyses of change from DB-baseline in ADCS-Instrumental ADL score showed a similar decline 
within treatment groups for patients with moderate or moderate to severe AD; however, at each 
timepoint the decline was less in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch 
group. 
The analysis of change from DB-baseline in ADAS-cog score showed a similar decline within treatment 
groups for patients with moderate or moderate to severe AD; however, at each timepoint the decline 
was less in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CENA713D2340 was designed to investigate the optimal use of Prometax Patch in longer term 
treatment to provide evidence on the benefit of a higher Prometax patch size (15 cm2) for those 
patients who seem to derive limited or no benefit on standard doses. 
The design of the study D2340 was appropriate. The co-primary efficacy variables ADAS-cog total 
score and ADCS-Instrumental ADL total score are accepted, they are commonly used as primary 
variables in clinical trials of Alzheimer’s disease. The defined objectives and outcomes were 
appropriate. The statistical methods for analysing efficacy were appropriate. 
Patients demographic and background characteristics, medical history and prior medication are typical 
for the targeted population. With respect to other baseline demographics and baseline data the 
treatment groups for the DB phase were comparable. 
There were no major differences in the discontinuation pattern with respect to amount, cause and time 
between the treatment groups during the DB phase, therefore discontinuation is not likely to have any 
major influence on the conclusion drawn from the efficacy data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the ITT-LOCF analysis, decline in function measured by the mean change from DB-baseline in 
ADCS-Instrumental ADL score, was less at each time-point in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than 
in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. The between-treatment group differences were statistically 
significant in favour of the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group at Week 48 (primary endpoint) (2.2 points; 
95% CI: 0.8, 3.6; p=0.002). 
Cognitive decline for the ITT-LOCF analysis, as measured by the mean change from DB baseline in 
ADAS-cog score, was less at each time-point in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch group, and the between-treatment group differences at Week 48 (-0.8 points; 
95% CI: -2.1, 0.5; p=0.227), were not statistically significant (primary endpoint). The between-
treatment group differences were statistically significant in favour of the Prometax 15 cm2 patch at 
Week 24 (-1.3 points; 95% CI: -2.5,-0.2; p=0.027). 
The results of the secondary efficacy endpoints (time to functional decline, Trail Making Test, NPI-10) 
showed that the difference between treatment group groups was not statistically significant for any of 
the criteria even if a numerical superiority for the Prometax patch 15 cm2 group over the Prometax 10 
cm2 patch group was observed. 
The prospective subgroups analysis of change from DB-baseline in ADCS-Instrumental ADL  and ADAS-
cog scores showed a similar functional and cognitive decline within treatment groups for patients who 
met the decline criteria in >36 weeks or in ≤ 36 weeks and independently of the disease status.

CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch showed a statistically significant difference in instrumental activities of daily 
living when compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch at weeks 24 and 48 but failed to show an efficacy at 
48 weeks (the endpoint) for cognitive decline. The difference for this co-primary endpoint was 
numerically in favour of Prometax 15 cm2 patch at week 48 and statistically significant in favour or 
Prometax 15 cm2 at 24 weeks compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch. 
For the secondary efficacy criteria the difference between treatment group groups was not statistically 
significant for any of the criteria. Nevertheless, the results show a numerical superiority for the 
Prometax patch 15 cm2 group over the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group for the Time to functional 
decline and Trail Making Test. 
Study 2340 failed to formally show the superiority of Prometax 15 cm2 patch over Prometax 10 cm2 
patch. Nevertheless, patients treated with Prometax 15 cm2 patch showed a lesser decline than 
patients treated by Prometax 10 cm2 patch in both domains. Thus, some patients treated initially with 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch with beneficial effect follows by a decline could benefit from the new dosage. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety objective of Study D2340 was to compare the safety and tolerability of target 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch vs. target Prometax 10 cm2 patch in the DB treatment phase with respect to 
the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs. 
The safety results from the double-blind phase of Study D2340 are presented here in the context of 
those reported from the pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled (Study D2320). As the AD indication 
for Prometax 10 cm2 was approved based on the evaluation of data from (Study D2320), the safety 
data from this 24-week study are not presented for evaluation, but for comparison to data from the 
first 24 weeks of treatment in Study D2340. 
Patient exposure 
The mean and median duration of exposure to study drug was similar in the 15 cm2 and 10 cm2 
treatment groups during the 48-week DB phase of Study D2340 (41.39 and 41.28 weeks, respectively) 
and in the 20 cm2, 10 cm2 and placebo groups during the 24 weeks of Study D2320 (22.0, 21.4 and 
23.0 weeks, respectively). 
Adverse events 
In the DB phase of Study D2340 no new safety signals emerged from the analysis of AEs with either 
the Prometax 15 cm2 or 10 cm2 patches. 
During the full 48-week double-blind phase of Study D2340, the most frequently affected SOCs were 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Psychiatric disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, 
and Nervous system disorders. The incidence of AEs in each of these SOCs was higher in the Prometax 
15 cm2 patch group compared to the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. Of the commonly observed AEs 
(≥ 3% in any treatment group) the most frequent event in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group was 
nausea, followed by vomiting, fall, weight decreased, application site erythema, decreased appetite, 
diarrhea and urinary tract infection. The percentages of patients with these events were higher in the 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the 10 cm2 patch group. With the exception of weight 
decreased, the percentages of patients with these events decreased over time in both treatment 
groups. 
Prometax

Other AEs of interest which occurred less frequently, but were observed in a markedly higher 
percentage of patients in the Prometax 15 cm2 group than in the 10 cm2 group, included dizziness and 
upper abdominal pain. The percentages of patients with these events also decreased over time in both 
treatment groups. 
The majority of patients reported AEs of mild to moderate severity. The AE severity profile was 
generally similar for both the Prometax 15 cm2 and 10 cm2 patch groups. 
When the first 24 weeks of treatment in the DB phase of Study D2340 was compared to the 24 weeks 
of treatment in Study D2320, the AE profiles of the Prometax 10 cm2 groups in both studies were 
generally similar, but many individual AEs were more frequent in the Study D2320. The most common 
gastrointestinal AEs were all reported in substantially lower percentages of patients in the Prometax 15 
cm2 patch group from Study D2340 than in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group from Study D2320. 
However, these events were generally reported in a higher percentage of patients in the Prometax 15 
cm2 patch group from Study D2340 than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group from either study. 
This pattern was also observed for the majority of commonly reported psychiatric and nervous system 
related AEs. However, as noted above, a substantially higher percentage of patients in the Prometax 
10 cm2 patch group of Study D2320 than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group from Study D2340 
reported these AEs making the comparison between the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group and the 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch group difficult to evaluate. 
After 24 weeks of treatment in Study D2340, the overall incidence rate of AEs was similar in both 
treatment groups and lower than during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Other than AEs of nausea, 
fall, weight decreased, and urinary tract infection in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group, all AEs 
observed after Week 24 were reported in less than 3% of patients. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
During the full 48-week DB phase, no new safety signals emerged from the analysis of the events. The 
overall incidence of SAEs was approximately 15% in both treatment groups. The most frequently 
affected SOCs were Nervous system disorders, Infections and infestations, Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications, Psychiatric disorders, and Gastrointestinal disorders. Only 8 SAEs were 
reported in greater than 2 patients (0.7%) in either treatment group. The most frequent events in the 
15 cm2 group, were pneumonia and urinary tract infection, each reported in 4 (1.4%) patients; in the 
10 cm2 group, the most frequent SAE was urinary tract infection also reported in 4 (1.4%) patients.    
During the first 24 weeks of the DB phase, the overall incidence of SAEs was similar for the Prometax 
15 cm2 and 10 cm2 patch groups (10% and 9.5%, respectively); the most frequent SAEs were 
agitation, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection, each reported in 3 patients (1.1%) in the Prometax 
15 cm2 patch group. When the first 24 weeks of treatment in the DB phase of Study D2340 was 
compared to the 24 weeks of treatment in Study D2320, the overall incidence of SAEs was highest in 
the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group from Study D2320 (11.9%), and the lowest in the Prometax 10 cm2 
patch and placebo groups from Study D2320 (7.9% and 8.6% respectively). 
During the period of Prometax patch treatment after Week 24 in Study D2340 (DB phase), the overall 
incidence rate of SAEs was lower in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 
group (7.5% vs. 9.8%, respectively) and lower than during the first 24 weeks of treatment (7.5% vs. 
10.0%, respectively). Nine SAEs were reported in ≥ 0.5% of patients.

The safety profile for deaths was similar between the treatment groups. The Prometax 15 cm2 patch 
group had a lower incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuations compared to the Prometax 10 
cm2 patch group (Table 5-11).

Study D2340 
There were 8 (1.4%) deaths during the 48-week DB phase of this study. Three (1.1%) deaths occurred 
in Prometax 15 cm2 patch group and 5 (1.8%) deaths occurred in the Prometax 10 cm2 group. One 
additional death occurred 27 days after the last dose of study medication and was not captured in the 
clinical database. No pattern was seen in the frequency of death by SOC or preferred term. None of the 
deaths were attributed by the investigator to study treatment. 
Study D2320 
During the 24 weeks of Study D2320, 5 (1.7%) patients died in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch group, 4 
(1.4%) died in the Prometax 10 cm2 group and 3 (1.0%) died in the placebo groups. None of the 
deaths was attributed by the investigator to study treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory evaluations were only performed at screening and baseline in Study D2340. The results of 
these evaluations were recorded as source data and not captured in the clinical database; therefore, no 
laboratory data are presented. 
The incidence of patients with newly-occurring ECG abnormalities was similar (17.5% vs. 15.2%) in 
the Prometax 15 cm2 and Prometax 10 cm2 patch treatment groups, respectively. 
A clinically notable decrease in weight (≥ 7%) was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the 
Prometax 15 cm2 group, than in the Prometax 10 cm2 group (18.6 %. vs. 15.2%, respectively). 
Safety in special populations 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Prometax has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions (minimal metabolism via the core 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). Prometax may show pharmacodynamic interactions with other 
cholinomimetic drugs, which should not be used at the same time as Prometax.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the full 48-week DB phase of Study D2340 no new safety signals emerged from the analysis of 
the events. Overall, the percentage of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in the 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch group compared to the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group (9.6% vs. 12.7%, 
respectively). The most frequent AE leading to discontinuation was vomiting, which was reported in 4 
(1.4%) patients in the Prometax patch 15 cm2 group and 1 (0.4%) patients in the Prometax patch 10 
cm2 group. Nausea was reported as an AE leading to discontinuation in one patient (0.4%) in both 
groups and diarrhoea in 1 patient (0.4%) in the Prometax patch 10 cm2 group. Other than an AE of 
application site pruritus, which led to discontinuation in 3 (1.1%) of patients in both treatment groups 
and aggression which led to discontinuation in 3 (1.1%) of the Prometax patch 10 cm2 group, all the 
remaining discontinuations were reported in less than 1% of patients. 
During the first 24 weeks of the DB phase in Study D2340, the overall percentage of patients with AEs 
leading to discontinuation was lower in the 15 cm2 patch group than in the 20 cm2 group from Study 
D2320 (7.9% vs. 10.2%, respectively) and lower than the 10 cm2 group from either study. 
Gastrointestinal-related AEs led to discontinuation most frequently in the Prometax 20 cm2 patch 
group from Study D2320, with discontinuations due to nausea and vomiting each occurring in 1.7% of 
patients compared to 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group from Study 
D2340. 
During the period of Prometax patch treatment after Week 24 of the DB Phase in Study D2340, the 
overall incidence rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group 
than in the Prometax 10 cm2 group (2.5% vs. 4.9%, respectively) and lower than during the first 24 
weeks of treatment (7.9% vs. 8.5%, respectively). Only 2 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported 
in ≥ 0.5% of patients (cerebrovascular accident [0.8%] and atrial fibrillation [0.8%]). 
Post marketing experience 
A cumulative review of medication errors in the 20th PSUR (01 February 2011 – 31 January 2012), 
showed a total of 778 events grouping for medication error for the patch formulation (283 cases in the 
last review period). Medication errors is the most important cause of overdose with Prometax patches 
(61/65 overdoses reported in the PSUR were in the context of a medication error). 
The analysis of notified cases of medication errors, before and after the Direct Healthcare Professional 
Letter (DHPC), disseminated on 10 April 2010, showed that cases are still being reported and no clear 
trends of improvement were observed after the issuance of the DHPC. The MAH acknowledges that the 
concern on medication misuse and medication error remains. As a consequence further measures have 
been proposed by the MAH to manage the risk, these include: 
- Educational material which will be provided to all physician who are expected to prescribe Prometax,  
- Drug utilization study (CENA713D2409) to assess the appropriate use and estimation of inappropriate 
drug use of rivastigmine patches (5 cm2, 10 cm2, 15 cm2) and titration patterns of rivastigmine 
patches, particularly regarding increases from a lower to a higher dose and switches from rivastigmine 
capsule/oral solution to patches, 
- Targeted follow-up checklists will be employed to ascertain both past and ongoing issues leading to 
multipatch use at both the healthcare provider as well as the patient/caregiver level, 
- Training of Novartis Prometax personnel sales and marketing personnel who will distribute the above 
listed materials.

In addition, the SmPC of all transdermal formulation have been updated in order to include information 
on recommendation on administration of patches and warning message related to the risk of overdose 
resulting from misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from the 48-week DB phase of study D2340, demonstrated that: 
- Adverse events most frequently reported involved the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, followed by 
Psychiatric disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, and Nervous system 
disorders SOCs. 
- The most frequently reported AEs with Prometax 15 cm2 patch, and in a higher frequency compared 
to Prometax 10 cm2 patch, were nausea, followed by vomiting,  fall, application site erythema, 
decreased appetite and diarrhoea. 
- No conclusion can be definitely drawn when comparing for both Prometax patch groups the 
proportion of cases of decrease in weight in patients with nausea [15 cm2 : 2/27(7.4%) vs 10 cm2 : 
2/10 (20%)] or vomiting [15 cm2 : 5/25(20%) vs 10 cm2 :0] or diarrhoea [15 cm2 : 4/14 (26.6%) vs 
10 cm2 : 2/12 (16.6%)], even if this one is relatively more important with the higher Prometax patch 
dosage, when considering vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, the slightly higher percentage of 
patients who had relevant medical histories for gastrointestinal disorders in the Prometax 15 cm2 
group compared to the 10 cm2 group (32.5% vs. 28.9 %, respectively) should be taken into 
consideration in the interpretation of these data. More females than males were included in the 
Prometax 15 cm2 group compared to the 10 cm2 group; however no conclusion can be drawn on 
specific risk factors for clinically notable decrease in weight (≥ 7%) with Prometax 15 cm2 patch based 
on the small number of patients presenting this event. 
- Prometax 15 cm2 patch showed a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, 
weight decrease, appetite decreased, and upper abdominal pain) compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch. 
With the exception of weight decreased, the percentages of patients with these events decreased over 
time in both treatment groups. 
- AE severity profile was generally similar for both the Prometax 15 cm2 and 10 cm2 patch groups, 
with the majority of patients reporting mild to moderate severity. Severe gastrointestinal disorders 
were at similar frequency between the treatment groups, vomiting being the most reported. 
- Dizziness was also reported in higher proportions of patients in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group 
compared to the lower dose treatment group, without correlation with falls. 
- Deaths were reported at similar frequencies in the treatment groups and did not raise no new safety 
issue. 
- Serious AEs were reported at similar frequencies in the treatment groups. The most common 
preferred terms were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, dehydration, vomiting and falls. 
- Discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the Prometax 15 cm2 dose treatment group compared to 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation were application site 
pruritus and application site rash, which was reported in the same percentage of patients in each of the 
treatment groups. Vomiting, was more frequent in the Prometax patch 15 cm2 group compared to the 
lower dose treatment group. Time to first AE leading to discontinuation showed no major differences in 
the discontinuation pattern over time between the two treatment groups.

- Medication errors is the most important cause of overdose with Prometax patches (61/65 overdoses 
reported in the PSUR were in the context of a medication error). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
As a conclusion, the safety results from the DB phase of Study D2340 showed that the type and 
severity of adverse events reported with the Prometax 15 cm2 patch were consistent with the known 
safety profile of the Prometax 10 cm2 patch. A dose-dependent effect is clearly observed primary for 
gastrointestinal events that represented the most frequently adverse events reported with Prometax 
15 cm2 in study D2340. The potential consequences (i.e weight decrease) of GI side effects observed 
more frequently in patients treated by Prometax 15 cm2 patch compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch in 
the first 24 weeks did not raise major concerns in study D2340, considering the unlikely relationship 
between clinically notable decrease in weight and GI events occurring concomitantly in patients, based 
on the short duration of the GI events and/or the long time period between the events in majority of 
cases. 
The dose dependent pattern is also observed for the majority of commonly reported psychiatric and 
nervous system related AEs. No new safety signals emerged from the analysis of AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, or SAEs. Post-hoc analysis showed that during the EOL phase, the type and severity of 
adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of the Prometax 10 cm2 patch. 
The CHMP considered appropriate the risk minimisation measure proposed by the MAH to reduce the 
risk of medication error and misuse. However the CHMP requested that a review of new medication 
error cases should be provided by the MAH. The full Study protocol, including feasibility assessment 
accompanied by a report on the status of new risk minimisation tools implementation in each country 
will be presented for CHMP consideration (Section 4). 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

these may respond to omitting 
one or more doses. If adverse 
reactions persist, the daily 
dose should be temporarily 
reduced to the previous well-
tolerated dose or the treatment 
may be discontinued. 
•  Section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions for use:  
Dose titration: Gastrointestinal 
disorders such as nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea are 
dose-related, and may occur 
particularly when initiating 
treatment and/or increasing 
the dose (see section 4.8). 
These adverse reactions occur 
more commonly in women. 
Patients who show signs or 
symptoms of dehydration 
resulting from prolonged 
vomiting or diarrhoea can be 
managed with intravenous 
fluids and dose reduction or 
discontinuation if recognised 
and treated promptly. 
Dehydration can be associated 
with serious outcomes. 
In case of severe vomiting 
associated with rivastigmine 
treatment, appropriate dose 
adjustments are recommended 
in section 4.2 must be made. 
Some cases of severe vomiting 
were associated with 
oesophageal rupture (see 
section 4.8). Such events 
appeared to occur particularly 
after dose increments or high 
doses of rivastigmine. 
•  Section 4.8 Undesirable 
effects: The most commonly 
reported adverse drug 
reactions are gastrointestinal 
including nausea (38%) and 
vomiting (23%), especially 
during titration. Female

•  Section 4.9 Overdose: 
Symptoms 
Most cases of accidental 
overdose have not been 
associated with any clinical 
signs or symptoms and almost 
all of the patients concerned 
continued rivastigmine 
treatment. Where symptoms 
have occurred, they have 
included nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, hypertension or 
hallucinations. Due to the 
known vagotonic effect of 
cholinesterase inhibitors on 
heart rate, bradycardia and/or 
syncope may also occur. 
Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in 
one case; following 
conservative management the 
patient fully recovered within 
24 hours. 
Treatment 
As rivastigmine has a plasma 
half-life of about 1 hour and a 
duration of 
acetylcholinesterase inhibition 
of about 9 hours, it is 
recommended that in cases of 
asymptomatic overdose no 
further dose of rivastigmine 
should be administered for the 
next 24 hours. In overdose 
accompanied by severe nausea 
and vomiting, the use of 
antiemetics should be

considered. Symptomatic 
treatment for other adverse 
reactions should be given as 
necessary. 
In massive overdose, atropine 
can be used. An initial dose of 
0.03 mg/kg intravenous 
atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with 
subsequent doses based on 
clinical response. Use of 
scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended.

and an increased incidence or 
severity of tremor have been 
observed in patients with

to the discontinuation of 
rivastigmine in some cases 
(e.g. discontinuations due to

vs 0% on placebo). Clinical 
monitoring is recommended for 
these adverse reactions.

and precautions for use 
Skin application site reactions 
may occur with rivastigmine 
patch and are usually mild or 
moderate in intensity. These 
reactions are not in themselves 
an indication of sensitisation. 
However, use of rivastigmine 
patch may lead to allergic 
contact dermatitis. 
Allergic contact dermatitis 
should be suspected if 
application site reactions

dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require 
rivastigmine treatment should 
only be switched to oral 
rivastigmine after negative

possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by 
exposure to rivastigmine patch 
may not be able to take 
rivastigmine in any form. 
There have been rare post-

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The study (D2340) was designed to investigate the optimal use of Prometax Patch in longer term 
treatment to provide evidence on the benefit of a higher Prometax patch size (15 cm2) for those 
patients who seem to derive limited or no benefit on standard doses. 
The primary efficacy analysis variables are the change from baseline DB randomization to DB Week 48 
in the ADAS-cog total score and ADCS-Instrumental ADL score. 
Activities of daily living as measured by ADCS-Instrumental ADL subscale showed the superiority of 
Prometax 15 cm2 patch when compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch. A statistically significant lesser 
decline (i.e. improved therapeutic benefit) was observed in the Prometax 15 cm2 patch compare to 
Prometax 10 cm2 patch at week 24. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The between treatment group differences for cognitive decline were statistically significant in favour of 
the Prometax 15 cm2 patch at Week 24 (-1.3 points; 95% CI: -2.5,-0.2; p=0.027), but not 
statistically significant at Week 48 (-0.8 points; 95% CI: -2.1 , 0.5; p=0.227), which was one of the 
co-primary endpoint. The MAH stated that the controlled clinical trials aimed at demonstrating short 
term improvement in AD (at least 6 months). Nevertheless, Prometax patch treatment could be used 
for at least 12 months. However, cognitive decline in ADAS-cog score was less at each time-point in 
the Prometax 15 cm2 patch group than in the Prometax 10 cm2 patch group. 
The results of the secondary efficacy endpoints (Time to decline, Trial Making Test, Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory) showed that the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant for 
any of the criteria. However, a numerical superiority in favour of Prometax 15 cm2 patch was observed 
for time to decline and TMT. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Prometax 15 cm2 patch in study D2340 appears to be consistent with what has 
been observed in previous studies and in post-marketing with Prometax patch, and demonstrates a 
dose-dependence effect, in particular for gastro-intestinal events. GI side effects are expected to be 
more frequent in the patients treated with the already approved capsule than in the patients treated 
with the 15 cm2 patch. However, GI events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) are identified risks for 
Prometax oral and transdermal formulations, as well described in the RMP and observed in PSUR. 
This dose dependent pattern is also observed for the majority of commonly reported psychiatric and 
nervous system related AEs. However, no new safety signals emerged from the analysis of AEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation, or SAEs. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The potential consequences (i.e weight decrease) of GI side effects, observed more frequently in 
patients treated by Prometax 15 cm2 patch compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch in the first 24 weeks, 
Prometax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/55126/2013 
Page 41/44 
 
 
 
did not raise major concerns in study D2340, considering the unlikely temporal relationship between 
clinically notable decrease in weight and GI events occurring concomitantly in patients (i.e.short 
duration of the GI events and/or long time period between the events in majority of cases). 
No conclusion can be definitely drawn when comparing for both Prometax patch groups the proportion 
of cases of decrease in weight in patients with nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, even if this one is 
relatively more important with the higher Prometax patch dosage, when considering vomiting and 
diarrhoea. In addition, the slightly higher percentage of patients who had relevant medical histories for 
gastrointestinal disorders in the Prometax 15 cm2 group compared to the 10 cm2 group (32.5% vs. 
28.9 %, respectively) should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of these data. 
The identified risk of overdose associated with medication errors (multiple patches or incorrect doses 
during switch from oral to transdermal formulations), is currently not entirely managed with existing 
patches (5 and 10 cm2) as demonstrated in the last PSURs. This risk is expected to be greater if a new 
higher dosage patch is approved and risk minimisation activities have been identified accordingly. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Although the superior efficacy of Prometax 15 cm2 patch as compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch was 
not statistically demonstrated for the co-primary endpoint, patients treated with the Prometax 15 cm2 
patch showed a consistent lesser decline (i.e. improved therapeutic benefit) in activities of daily living 
as measured by ADCS-Instrumental ADL subscale and cognition measured by ADAS-cog score when 
compared to Prometax 10 cm2 patch. 
The safety profile of Prometax 15 cm2 patch appears to be consistent with what has been observed 
with currently approved Prometax patch formulations. A dose-dependent effect is clearly observed for 
gastrointestinal events that represented the most frequently adverse events reported with Prometax 
15 cm2 in study D2340, but these events do not appear to be associated with a significant higher risk 
of potential consequences (i.e weight decrease). This dose dependent pattern is also observed for the 
majority of commonly reported psychiatric and nervous system related AEs, and no new safety signals 
emerged from the analysis of AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or SAEs. New minimisation activities 
(for all patch dosages) are established to better manage the risk of overdose, and their efficiency will 
be prospectively evaluated. In addition, the CHMP requested that a review of reported cases of 
medication errors is provided on a 6-monthly basis by the MAH, in order to capture any new findings 
related to this risk between PSURs. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered appropriate the risk minimisation measure proposed by the MAH to handle the 
risk of medication error associated with the use of transdermal patches. Additionally as a result of the 
efficacy study it is clear that patient could benefit from the new dosage. As a consequence the CHMP 
considered that the overall Benefit Risk of Prometax 15 cm2 patch is positive.

4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Prometax 13.3 mg/24 hours in the symptomatic treatment of 
mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia is favourable and therefore recommends granting the 
extension of the marketing authorisation subject to the conditions below. 
In addition, the CHMP considered by consensus the following variation acceptable and recommends the 
variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

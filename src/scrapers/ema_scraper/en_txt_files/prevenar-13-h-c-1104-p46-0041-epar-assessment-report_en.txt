2. Clinical studies 
6096A1-3012:  To  assess  the  pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  in  children  that 
have previously received 1 or 2 doses of Prevenar at approximately 3 or 3 and 5 months of age, when 
measured 1 month after the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC in each of 2 age groups in Sweden. 
  Description 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13-
valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC)  when  measured  1  month  after  the  last  scheduled 
dose  of  13vPnC  in  each  of  2  age  groups.  The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the 
pneumococcal immune response induced by 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant dose  of 
13vPnC  in  group  1.  The  safety  objective of  this  study  was  to  evaluate the  acceptability  of  the  safety 
profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse 
events (AEs). 
  Study design 
This was an open-label, multicenter study in which all subjects were enrolled into 1 of 2 groups based 
on age. The immunogenicity of 13vPnC was evaluated in children who had previously received 1 or 2 
doses of Prevenar. A 2+1 vaccination schedule was followed with vaccinations at 3, 5, and 12 months 
of age. The study included 2 groups: 
Blood  samples  for  group  1  were  to  be  obtained  at  approximately  1  month  (28  to  42  days)  after  the 
13vPnC infant dose, prior to the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. For 
Prevenar 13 P46 041

group  2,  blood  samples  were  to  be  collected  immediately  before  vaccination  and  approximately  1 
month  (28  to  42  days)  after  vaccination.  Blood  samples  from  all  subjects  were  to  be  tested  for 
serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies elicited by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 
4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) present in 13vPnC. 
  Study population /Sample size 
This  was  a  descriptive  study  and  was  not  powered  for  formal  statistical  comparisons.  Based  on 
previous  experience,  115  subjects  per  group  to  provide  100  evaluable  subjects  per  group  was  to  be 
sufficient to provide adequate precision in study results for descriptive assessment. 
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Subjects were eligible to be enrolled in  this study  if  they were healthy 
infants;  were  available  for  the  entire  study  period;  and  if  their  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  could  be 
reached by telephone and were able and willing to comply with all study procedures.  
Main  Criteria  for  Exclusion:  Exclusion  criteria  included:  previous  vaccination  with  licensed  or 
investigational  pneumococcal  vaccine  other  than  Prevenar;  contraindication  to  vaccination  with 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; previous anaphylactic reaction or allergy to any vaccine or vaccine-
related component; bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would 
contraindicate  intramuscular  injection;  history  of  culture-proven  invasive  disease  caused  by  S 
pneumoniae; known or suspected immune deficiency or immune suppression; major known congenital 
malformation or serious chronic disorder; significant neurologic disorder or history of seizure, including 
febrile  seizure,  or  significant  stable  or  evolving  disorders  such  as  cerebral  palsy,  encephalopathy, 
hydrocephalus, or other significant disorder; received blood products or gamma globulin during the last 
3  months;  participation  in  another  interventional  or  investigational  trial,  although  participation  in 
purely  observational  studies  was  acceptable;  direct  descendant  (eg,  child  or  grandchild)  of  the  study 
site  personnel;  any  major  illness  or  condition  that,  in  the  investigator’s  judgment,  would  have 
substantially  increased  the  risk  associated  with  the  subject’s  participation  in,  and  completion  of,  the 
study, or could have precluded the evaluation of the subject’s response. 
 
Treatments 
Group 1: Subjects were aged ≥140 to ≤196 days and were to receive 2 doses of 13vPnC at 5 and 12 
months  of  age.  These  subjects  had  received  a  single  dose  of  Prevenar  at  approximately  3 months  of 
age prior to enrollment in the study. 
Group 2: Subjects were aged ≥336 to ≤392 days and were to receive 1 dose of 13vPnC at 12 months 
of  age.  These  subjects  had  received  Prevenar  at  approximately  3  and  5  months  of  age  prior  to 
enrollment in the study. Thus, subjects continued on a 2+1 vaccination schedule (3, 5, and 12-month). 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Assessment Methods: Blood samples for group 1 were obtained at approximately 
1 month (28 to 42 days) after the 13vPnC infant dose, prior to the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 
42  days)  after  the  toddler  dose.  For  group  2,  blood  samples  were  collected  immediately  before 
vaccination and approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after vaccination. For all blood samples, serum 
concentrations (μg/mL) of anticapsular IgG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 
23F). 
Safety Assessment Methods: Safety assessment was based on e-diary recordings of local reactions 
(redness,  swelling,  and  tenderness)  and  systemic  events  (decreased  appetite,  irritability,  increased 
sleep, decreased sleep, temperature, and use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms) 
for  7  days  after  each  vaccination.  AEs  were  also  monitored  during  the  study.  For  any  reactions  that 
persisted at day 7, the e-diary prompted the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on a daily basis regarding the 
status of the reaction until the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) recorded an end date in the e-diary. 
  Statistical Methods 
Analysis Populations: For immunogenicity analyses, 2 analysis populations were defined: evaluable and 
all-available  immunogenicity  populations.  The  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  was  the  primary 
immunogenicity population. 
To  be  included  in  an  evaluable  immunogenicity  population,  the  subject  was  eligible,  within  the  age 
range for the administered dose (infant or toddler), received study vaccine at all expected doses, had 
Prevenar 13 P46 041 
Page 3/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood  drawn  within  the  protocol  specified  time  frames,  had  at  least  1  valid  and  determinate  assay 
result for the proposed analysis, and had no other major protocol violations. 
All  subjects  meeting  these  criteria  were  included.  To  be  included  in  an  all-available  immunogenicity 
population, a subject was to have at least 1 valid and determinate assay result related to the proposed 
analysis. 
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine were included in the safety population. 
Separate  safety  populations  were  defined  for  each  vaccination:  dose  1  and  dose  2  (group  1)  and  all 
vaccinated  subjects  (group  2).  Subjects  who lacked  any  safety  data  for  a  particular  vaccination  were 
excluded from that analysis. 
Immunogenicity: The primary endpoint for each of the serotypes was the IgG antibody concentration 
after  the  last  scheduled  dose  of  13vPnC  in  each  group.  The  geometric  mean  IgG  concentrations  and 
corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each group following the last 
scheduled  dose.  The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  antibody  concentration 
≥0.35 μg/mL measured 1 month after the infant dose of 13vPnC in group 1 was a secondary endpoint. 
The pneumococcal IgG serotype antibody concentrations were logarithmically transformed for  
analysis. Within each age  group and for each antibody concentration separately, geometric means of 
the  antibody  concentrations  from  each  of  the  blood  draws  were  calculated.  Two  (2)-sided,  95%  CI 
were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed 
assay results computed using the Student t distribution. 
To assess the within-subject post-vaccination and pre-vaccination differences in  concentration for the 
last scheduled dose, the fold rise in geometric mean concentration (GMC) from pre-vaccination to post-
vaccination  and  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  estimated  for  each  age  group  using  the  logarithmically 
transformed assay results. 
Safety: The safety endpoints were AEs, local reactions, and systemic events including fever and use of 
antipyretic medications. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher. 
For  local  reactions  and  systemic  events,  including  fever  and  use  of  antipyretic  medications,  the 
duration  of  the  local  reaction/systemic  events  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics,  by  age 
group. The mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were presented along with the number 
of  unknown  durations.  Only  subjects  actually  experiencing  the  reaction/event  were  included  in  the 
summary statistics. Subjects with no reported reaction/event were included in the number of subjects 
with a known value. 
The  minimum  and  maximum  diameters  for  redness  and  swelling  as  well  as  temperature  were 
summarized  by  age  group  using  descriptive  statistics.  The  mean,  median,  minimum,  maximum,  and 
standard  deviation  were  presented.  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  in  each  category  of 
tenderness were summarized by age group. This tabulation was performed for each dose separately. 
All  AEs  were  categorized according  to  the  Medical Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA).  The 
relationship between AEs and the study vaccine (13vPnC) was characterized as related or not related 
as described in the protocol. The severity of AEs was characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or life-
threatening. Any deaths were included in the last category, namely, life-threatening. 
AE summaries were produced separately for  each age group and for each vaccination. All summaries 
showed, by age group, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event  of each 
preferred  term,  arranged  by  system  organ  class,  and  the  number  of  occurrences  of  the  event. 
Separate summaries were produced for related AEs, for events characterized as severe, and for events 
characterized life-threatening. 
SAEs  (which  included  life-threatening  events)  were  summarized  for  age  group.  A  listing  of  SAEs  was 
generated as an aid for the statistician during the clinical study report review. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 234 subjects were enrolled. Subjects in group 1 (N=118) were assigned to receive two doses 
of 13vPnC (infant and toddler dose) and subjects in group 2 (N=116) were assigned to receive a single 
dose  of  13vPnC  (toddler  dose).  All  118  subjects  in  group  1  received  the  infant  vaccination.  Two  (2, 
1.7%) subjects were withdrawn after the infant dose; 1 because of parent/legal guardian request and

1 because of an AE. Thus, 116 (98.3%) subjects in group 1 received the toddler dose. All 116 subjects 
in group 2 received the toddler dose.

evaluable infant immunogenicity population. 
Table  9-6  presents  a  summary  of  pneumococcal  IgG  GMCs  before  the  toddler  dose  in  the  evaluable 
infant immunogenicity populations. The serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG GMCs observed before the 
toddler dose were lower when compared to the GMCs noted 1 month after the infant dose, except for 
serotypes 5, 6A, and 6B.

Table  9-7  presents  a  summary  of  pneumococcal  IgG  GMCs  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  in  the 
evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. The serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG GMCs for all 13 
serotypes observed 1 month the toddler dose were higher when compared to the GMCs noted before 
the toddler dose. For group 1 the GMCs after the toddler dose were higher compared to the GMCs after 
the infant dose, except for serotype 3, which was similar.

When  comparing  the  GMCs  before  and  after  vaccination  with  the  toddler  dose,  the  GMFRs  for  the  7 
common serotypes ranged from 4.45 (serotype 14) to 11.49 (serotype 6B) for group 1 and from 4.17 
(serotype 14) to 14.32  (serotype  6B)  for  group  2. For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  GMFRs  ranged 
from  4.51  (serotype  3)  to  30.58  (serotype  1)  for  group  1  and  from  4.3  (serotype  5)  to  177.31 
(serotype 7F) for group 2. 
In group 1 for the infant dose, the proportion of subjects achieving an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL 
to the 7 serotypes in common with Prevenar ranged from 53.0% (serotype 6B) to 99.1% (serotypes 4 
and 9V). The proportions of responders to the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 36.8% (serotype 6A) 
to 100.0% (serotype 3). 
  Safety results 
Local  Reactions:  After  the  infant  dose  in  group  1,  tenderness  was  reported  for  36.1%  of  subjects. 
Significant  tenderness  (defined  as  tenderness  interfering  with  limb  movement)  was  reported  for  only 
3.0% of subjects. Swelling and redness were reported for 33.7% and 40.2% of subjects, respectively. 
Most  reports  of  swelling  and  redness  were  mild  (0.5  to  2.0  cm  in  diameter)  and  none  were  severe 
(>7.0 cm). The mean duration of both tenderness and redness was 1.5 days, while the mean duration 
of swelling was 3.4 days. 
After  the  toddler  dose,  tenderness  was  reported  for  59.6%  of  subjects  in  group  1  and  for  52.7%  of 
subjects  in  group  2.  Significant  tenderness  was  reported  for  ≤7.8%  of  subjects  in  either  group. 
Swelling was reported for 53.8% of subjects in group 1 and for 54.5% of subjects in group 2, while the 
incidence  of  redness  was  62.5%  in  group  1  and  59.3%  in  group  2.  Most  reports  of  swelling  and 
redness were mild, and none were severe. In group 1, the mean durations of tenderness, swelling, and 
redness, respectively, were 2.6, 4.7, and 2.4 days; and in group 2 the mean durations were 2.5, 4.8, 
and 2.4 days.  
Systemic  Events:  After  the  infant  dose  in  group  1,  mild  fever  (≥38°C  but  ≤39°C)  was  reported  for 
26.2%  of  subjects,  moderate  fever  (>39°C  but  ≤40°C)  was  reported  for  2.0%  of  subjects,  and  no 
subjects  reported  severe  fever  (>40°C).  Use  of  antipyretic  medication  to  treat  or  prevent  symptoms 
was  reported  for  35.2%  of  subjects.  Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  reported  type  of  systemic 
event  (80.7%  of  subjects),  followed  by  increased  sleep  (50.9%),  decreased  sleep  (39.3%),  and 
Prevenar 13 P46 041

decreased  appetite  (36.4%).  The  mean  duration  of  fever  (≥38°C  )  was  1.4  days,  while  the  mean 
duration of other types of systemic events ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 days. 
After  the  toddler  dose,  the  incidence  of  mild  fever  was  31.3%  and  32.4%  in  group  1  and  group  2, 
respectively; the incidence of moderate fever was 5.2% and 3.9%, and no subjects had severe fever. 
Antipyretic  medication  was  used  to  treat  or  prevent  symptoms  in  45.5%  and  44.9%  of  subjects  in 
group  1  and  group  2,  respectively.  The  incidence  of  other  systemic  events  in  group  1  and  group  2, 
respectively, was 82.0% and 76.1% for irritability,  49.5% and 38.9% for increased sleep, 46.6% and 
44.0% for decreased appetite, and 36.2% and 33.0% for decreased sleep. The mean duration of fever 
was 1.6 days and 1.7 days, respectively; and the mean duration of other systemic events ranged from 
2.3 to 3.7 days in group 1 and from 2.2 to 3.3 days in group 2. 
Adverse  Events:  In  general,  the  types  of  unsolicited  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  the  types  of 
childhood  illnesses  and  conditions  commonly  occurring  in  this  age  group.  In  group  1,  AEs  occurring 
within 1 month after the infant dose were reported for 14 subjects (11.9%). The types of AEs reported 
most  frequently  were  infections  and  infestations  (8  subjects,  6.8%)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (3 
subjects, 2.5%). The most frequent individual AEs reported during this period were nasopharyngitis (5 
subjects, 4.2%) and diarrhea (2 subjects, 1.7%). All other AEs occurred in 1 subject each. Only 1 AE 
was  considered  related  to  study  vaccine  (mild  diarrhea  beginning  on  day  2).  Between  the  postinfant 
series visit and the toddler dose, AEs were reported for 8 subjects (6.8%). 
After the toddler dose, AEs were reported for 21.6% of subjects in group 1 and for 23.3% of subjects 
in group 2. The most frequent types of AEs were infections and infestations (14.7% in group 1; 13.8% 
in  group  2).  In  group  1,  the  most  frequently  reported  individual  AEs  (≥3%  of  subjects)  were 
nasopharyngitis  (6.9%),  vomiting  (5.2%),  and  pyrexia  (3.4%);  and  in  group  2,  nasopharyngitis 
(6.0%)  and  pyrexia  (3.4%).  After  the  toddler  dose,  5  AEs  considered  related  to  study  vaccine  were 
reported  for  3  subjects  in  group  1  (diarrhea  and  vomiting;  nasopharyngitis  and  cough;  and  lower 
extremity mass) and 1 subject in group 2 (rash). The lower extremity mass was described as a "non-
tender lump on the left leg." 
One  serious  AE  (SAE)  was  reported  within  1  month  after  the  infant  dose  (severe  diarrhea  lasting  6 
days,  considered  not  related  to  study  vaccine).  Between  the  postinfant  series  visit  and  the  toddler 
dose, 6 SAEs were reported for 4 subjects; these included gastroenteritis (in 4 subjects), foreign body, 
and  intussusception.  After  the  toddler  dose,  4  SAEs  were  reported  for  1  subject:  bronchitis,  asthma, 
diarrhea, and vomiting. There were no deaths during the study. One subject was withdrawn from the 
study on day 194 due to severe eczema (not considered related to study vaccine). 
Assessor’s  comment  on  study  6096A1-3012:  The  immunogenicity  results  of  this  study  show  that  the 
responses to the 7vPnC vaccine serotypes were very similar between the two groups. Group 1, which 
received the 13vPnC vaccine for the 5- and 12-month doses had higher GMCs to some of the additional 
serotypes  (1,  5,  6A  and  7F)  compared  with  group  2,  which  received  the  13vPnC  vaccine  for  the  12-
month  dose  only.  Group  2  had  higher  GMCs  for  serotype  19A  than  group  1.  No  OPA  results  were 
available for this study, but it is likely that the response to 19A in group 2 to some degree consists of 
non-functional  antibodies.  No  new  safety  concerns  arise  from  this  study.  Overall,  the  responses  are 
acceptable, and do not conflict with what has been demonstrated in other studies previously.

infant  series  (2-  or  3-dose  schedule)  of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (PCV)  followed  by a 
toddler dose of either PCV or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS). 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
 
 
To  describe  the  immune  response  by  avidity  assay  to  a  single  dose  of  13vPnC  in  children 
previously vaccinated with a primary infant series (2- or 3-dose schedule) of PCV followed by a 
toddler dose of either PCV or 23vPS.

single dose of 13vPnC  in children  previously vaccinated with a primary infant series (2-  or 3-
dose schedule) of PCV followed by a toddler dose of either PCV or 23vPS. 
The safety objective of this study was as follows: 
 
To  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  13vPnC  as  measured  by  the  occurrence  of  serious  adverse 
events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  (AEs),  and  solicited  local  and  systemic  reactions  in  the  2 
vaccine treatment groups. 
The results from the infant series and toddler dose analyses are presented in a separate study report 
(CSR-54901). 
  Study design 
Study  6096A1-3013  was  a  phase  3,  single-center,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity 
and  safety  of  13vPnC  in  healthy  children in  Iceland who  had  participated  in  study  D139-P506.  These 
subjects  had  previously  received  a  primary  infant  series  of  9-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate, 
includes 
meningococcal  group  C  saccharide  conjugate  combination  vaccine  (9vPnC-MnCC; 
polysaccharides of serotypes 1, 4, 5 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F; referred to in this study as PCV) in 
a  2-  or  3-dose  schedule  followed  by  a  toddler  dose  of  either  PCV  or  23vPS  (ie,  PCV/PCV  or 
PCV/23vPS). A minimum  of 100 subjects from study D139-P506 (50 subjects each from the PCV and 
23vPS toddler dose groups) were to enroll in study 6096A1-3013 and were to receive a childhood dose 
of 13vPnC (ie, vaccine sequence PCV/PCV/13vPnC or PCV/23vPS/13vPnC).  
  Study population /Sample size 
Main Criteria for Inclusion and exclusion: 
Subjects were enrolled in the study if they satisfied all of the following inclusion criteria: 
Prevenar 13 P46 041 
Page 9/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
participated in study D139-P506 and received all study vaccinations (infant series and toddler dose) as 
specified  in  the  protocol;  and,  were  healthy  children  as  determined  by  medical  history,  physical 
examination, and judgment of the investigator. 
Subjects  were  excluded  from  participation  in  the  study  if  they  met  any  of  the  following  exclusion 
criteria: 
 known  or  suspected  hypersensitivity  to  any  component  of  7-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine 
(7vPnC)  or  13vPnC;  history  of  culture-proven  invasive  disease  caused  by  S  pneumoniae;  known  or 
suspected immune deficiency or suppression  (including but not limited to: HIV infection, malignancy, 
immunosuppressive  therapy,  sickle  cell  hemoglobinopathy,  diabetes);  receipt  of  concomitant 
vaccination during study period; receipt of immunoglobulin within the previous 3 months; any medical 
condition  that  would,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  substantially  increase  the  subject’s  risk 
associated with participation and completion of the study or interfere with the evaluation of the study 
objectives  or  subject’s  response;  or,  receipt  of  23vPS  or  7vPnC  since  the  completion  of  study  D139-
P506. 
The sample size for this study was limited by the number of subjects who participated in the original 
study  D139-P506  (CSR-54901;  N=224)  and  the  ability  to  recruit  eligible  subjects  from  that  study.  A 
minimum of 100 subjects from study D139-P506 were to be enrolled (50 subjects each from the PCV 
and  23vPS  toddler  dose  groups).  However,  if  it  was  not  possible  to  enroll  the  minimum  number  of 
subjects within the 6 month enrollment period, then the analysis was to be performed with the number 
of subjects enrolled at the end of the 6 months. 
 
Treatments 
Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC following enrollment. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Pneumococcal Antibody Response 
Blood  samples  were  to  be  obtained  from  all  subjects  before  13vPnC  administration  at  visit  1  and  at 
visit  3  (28–42  days  after  13vPnC  administration).  A  second  optional  blood  draw  at  day  5–7  after 
13vPnC  administration  was  planned  in  order  to  describe  the  kinetics  of  the  immune  response. 
Immunogenicity was to be assessed by ELISA, OPA, and avidity assays.  
Safety 
The safety parameters included reactogenicity, local reactions and systemic events that occurred for a 
total  of  4  days  (day  of  13vPnC  administration  [day  0]  and  days  1  through  3  after  13vPnC 
administration),  and  AEs  that  occurred  from  consent  to  completion  of  the  study  at  visit  3  (day  28 
through day 42 after 13vPnC administration). 
  Statistical Methods 
The  co-primary  endpoints  were  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  antibody 
concentration ≥0.35μg/mL by ELISA and the proportion of subjects achieving a titer ≥1:8 by OPA for 
each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  at  visit  3  (28–42  days  after  vaccine  administration).  Two 
additional  endpoints  were added to  further  evaluate  response.  These  were the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  antibody  concentration  ≥1.0μg/mL  by  ELISA  and  the  proportion  of 
subjects achieving OPA titers ≥ lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). 
Immunogenicity was also evaluated by avidity assay as a secondary endpoint. The assay performed to 
measure  avidity  had  a  measurable  range  of  0.117  to  7.5  units.  In  accordance  with  the 
recommendation of the lab performing the assays, values above the upper limit were assigned a value 
of  8.0  and  those  below  the  lower  limit  were  assigned  a  value  of  0.10.  Results  were  expressed  as 
avidity index (AI). The AI was provided for each of the following 5 pneumococcal serotypes: 1, 5, 6B, 
19F, and 23F. 
The  kinetics  of  the  immune  response  following  13vPnC  administration  were  described  based  on  the 
antibody levels over time as assessed by IgG ELISA, OPA, and avidity assays. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  antibody  concentration  ≥1.0  μg/mL 
measured  1  month  after  the  last  scheduled  dose  of  13vPnC  was  also  calculated.  In  addition,  the 
proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ measured 1 month after the last scheduled dose of 
13vPnC  was  calculated.  For  each  serotype,  exact,  unconditional,  2-sided  95%  confidence  intervals 
(CIs)  on  the  proportions  were  calculated.  To  assess  treatment  differences,  exact,  unconditional,  2-
sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions [23vPS/13vPnC - PCV/13vPnC] were calculated. 
Within  each  vaccine  group  and  for  each  antibody  concentration  or  titer,  geometric  mean 
concentrations/titers  (GMCs/GMTs)  were  calculated.  The  geometric  mean  fold  rises  (GMFRs)  in 
Prevenar 13 P46 041

antibody  concentration/titers  (postvaccination/prevaccination)  were  summarized  by  geometric  means 
and 95% CIs,. With regard to OPA titers, for analysis purposes, titers below the LLOQ were set equal 
to  4  (one-half  the  limit  of  detection).  To  assess  differences  between  the  2  vaccine  groups,  2-sided, 
95% CIs for the ratio of the GMCs and the GMTs were constructed. In addition, the ratio of the GMFRs 
and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were  calculated.  The  CIs  were  computed  using  the  Student  t 
distribution for the mean difference  of the  measures on the logarithmic scale (23vPS/13vPnC relative 
to PCV/13vPnC). 
The  safety  endpoints  were  AEs,  local  reactions,  and  systemic  events,  including  fever.  Fever  was 
defined as an oral temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F). Use of antipyretic medication to treat and prevent 
symptoms was reported with systemic events but analyzed separately. The proportion of subjects with 
local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 4-day period after vaccination was 
summarized for each type of event. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  89  eligible  subjects  from  study  D139-P506  consented  to  participate  and  received  a 
subsequent  13vPnC  dose  as  part  of  vaccine  sequence  9vPnC-MnCC  (primary  series)/23vPS  (toddler 
dose)/13vPnC  or  9vPnC-MnCC  (primary  series)/PCV  (9vPnC-MnCC;  toddler  dose)/13vPnC;  for 
convenience, these groups are described as “23vPS/13vPnC” and “PCV/13vPnC” groups.  
 
Immunogenicity results 
At  1  month  after  vaccination,  the  proportion  of  responders  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG 
concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  was  ≥97%  in  both  vaccine  groups  for  all  13  serotypes  (Table  9-3).  IgG 
GMCs were higher in the PCV/13vPnC group than in the 23vPS/13vPnC group for all serotypes except 
serotype  3  (Table  9-5).  The  GMC  ratios  (23vPS/13vPnC  relative  to  PCV/13vPnC)  were  1.14  for 
serotype 3, and for all other serotypes ranged from 0.27 (serotype 1) to 0.89 (serotype 7F). The upper 
limit of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio was <1.0 for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 9V, 18C, and 23F, indicating a 
statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vaccine  groups  for  these  6  serotypes.  For  the 
23vPS/13vPnC group, GMFRs from  before vaccination  to 1 month after vaccination ranged from  1.83 
(serotype 3) to 7.87 (serotype 7F); in the PCV/13vPnC group GMFRs ranged from 1.88 (serotype 19F) 
to 6.9 (serotype 14), except for serotype 1 (GMFR = 25.51) and serotype 4 (GMFR = 26.07).

The proportions of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥1:8 at 1 month after vaccination were ≥97.2% for 
all serotypes in both vaccine groups (Table 9-7). OPA GMTs for the 23vPS/13vPnC group ranged from 
153 (serotype 3) to 11,156 (serotype 6B), and for the PCV/13vPnC group ranged from 188 (serotype 
3) to 11,477 (serotype 6B). The ratio of the GMTs (23vPS/13vPnC to PCV/13vPnC) was ≤1.0 for 11 of 
the 13 serotypes (Table 9-9).

Adjusted  geometric  mean  avidity  (GMA)  values  (assayed  for  serotypes  1,  5,  6B,  19F,  and  23F  only) 
were  also  higher  in  the  PCV/13vPnC  group  than  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  group.  In  the  23vPS/13vPnC 
group, adjusted GMAs ranged from 1.50 (serotype 1) to 3.44 (serotype 23F), while in the PCV/13vPnC 
group,  adjusted  GMAs  ranged  from  2.39  (serotype  19F)  to  5.35  (serotype  23F).  The  ratios  of  GMAs 
ranged from 0.34 (serotype 1) to 0.93 (serotype 19F).  
  Safety results 
Local  Reactions:  The  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  any  local  reaction  was  similar  in  the 
23vPS/13vPnC  group  (90.0%)  and  the  PCV/13vPnC  group  (87.2%).  The  incidences  of  local  reactions 
were  generally  similar  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  and  PCV/13vPnC  groups,  respectively,  for  tenderness 
(88.0%,  76.9%),  redness  (50.0%,  66.7%),  and  swelling  (44.0%,  59.0%),  and  there  were  no 
statistically  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in  the  incidence  of  any  type  of  local  reaction. 
Significant tenderness was reported for 12.0% of subjects in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and for 20.5% 
of subjects in the PCV/13vPnC group; and in both groups, reports of redness and swelling were most 
often  reported  as  being  of  moderate  severity.  The  mean  duration  of  each  type  of  local  reaction  was 
≤2.8 days in both vaccine groups. 
Systemic Events: Fever was reported for only 1 subject in each vaccine group, and both reports were 
mild (≥38°C but ≤39°C). Use of antipyretic medications to treat or  prevent fever  was reported  for 3 
subjects (6.0%) in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and for 4 subjects (10.3%) in the PCV/13vPnC group. The 
incidences  of  each  of  the  other  types  of  systemic  events  were  similar  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  and 
PCV/13vPnC groups, respectively, for irritability (18.4%, 11.4%), decreased appetite (12.2%, 10.3%), 
increased  sleep  (4.0%,  12.8%),  rash  (6.0%,  2.6%),  and  decreased  sleep  (0.0%,  5.1%).  The  mean 
duration of each type of systemic event was ≤2.2 days in both vaccine groups. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events: Adverse events occurring within approximately 1 month after vaccination 
were  reported  for 8  subjects  (16.0%)  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  group  and  for  7  subjects  (17.9%) in  the 
PCV/13vPnC group. The most frequently reported types of AEs were infections and infestations (4.0% 
of  subjects  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  group  and  12.8%  of  subjects  in  the  PCV/13vPnC  group),  and 
Prevenar 13 P46 041

gastrointestinal disorders (6.0%, 2.6%). Most of the events were the types of diseases and conditions 
often  seen  in  children  of  this  age.  Only  2  subjects  (in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  group)  had  AEs  considered 
related to study vaccine: 1 subject with lymphadenopathy and vomiting, and 1 subject with urticaria. 
There were no deaths, no serious AEs, and no discontinuations due to AEs during the study. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  immunogenicity  results  of  this  study  show  that  the  group  receiving  the 
23vPS vaccine had lower responses to the majority of serotypes after the childhood dose (at 7 years of 
age). The 23vPS vaccine has been reported to induce immune hyporesponsiveness, and this could be 
the case even after 6 years. It is unclear why  the  results are presented for the 7vPnC serotypes and 
additional  serotypes,  when  the  primary  vaccination  was  given  using  a  9-vPnC  vaccine.  However,  all 
results are presented, and no additional information is requested. No new safety signal was detected in 
this study. Overall, the responses are acceptable, and do not conflict with what has been demonstrated 
in other studies previously. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
Both  studies  present  results  for  vaccination  schedules  involving  other  pneumococcal  vaccine,  i.e. 
7vPnC  and  23vPS  vaccines  respectively.  They  provide  useful  information,  but  the  results  are  in 
agreement with the current SPC, and no type II variation is requested.   
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
III. 
No new information has been obtained from these studies that change the overall benefit/risk balance. 
No type II variation is requested.

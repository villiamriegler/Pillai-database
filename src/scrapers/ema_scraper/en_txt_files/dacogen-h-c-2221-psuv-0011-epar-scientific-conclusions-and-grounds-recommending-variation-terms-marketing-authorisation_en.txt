Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Dacogen, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
The MAH provided a cumulative review of the reports of caecitis, typhilitis and neutropaenic colitis 
events reported with Dacogen. 7 cases were discussed by the MAH in detail.   
The PRAC acknowledged the confounding factors in some cases reported and known background 
occurrence of neutropenic enterocolitis in individuals with hematologic malignancies who are 
neutropenic and have a breakdown of gut mucosal integrity. Nevertheless, taking into account the 
possible causal association between decitabine administration and the development of caecitis / 
neutropenic colitis and due to the seriousness of the event (fatal issue reported for 5 out of the 7 
cases), the PRAC considers that that changes to the product information are warranted to reflect the 
risk of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis and caecitis in section 4.8 of decitabine EU SmPC 
and relevant section of the PL. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Dacogen, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance DECITABINE is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

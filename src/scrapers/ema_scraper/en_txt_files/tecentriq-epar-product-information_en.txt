CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC)  
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC: 
• 
• 
after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or 
who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% (see 
section 5.1). 
Early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete resection and 
platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose 
tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or 
ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria). 
Metastatic NSCLC   
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. In patients with EGFR mutant or 
ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is 
indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies (see section 5.1).

Tecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment 
of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who do not have EGFR mutant or 
ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% TC or ≥ 10% tumour-infiltrating immune 
cells (IC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC 
should also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq (see section 5.1). 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  
Tecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) (see section 5.1).  
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and 
who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced or unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Tecentriq must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
PD-L1 testing for patients with UC or TNBC or NSCLC 
Tecentriq monotherapy 
Patients with first-line (1L) UC, early-stage NSCLC, and 1L metastatic NSCLC should be selected for 
treatment based on the tumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1). 
Tecentriq in combination therapy 
Patients with previously untreated TNBC should be selected for treatment based on the tumour 
expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Tecentriq is either 840 mg administered intravenously every two weeks, or 
1 200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks, or 1 680 mg administered intravenously 
every four weeks, as presented in Table 1. 
When Tecentriq is administered in combination therapy please also refer to the full prescribing 
information for the combination products (see also section 5.1).

Special populations 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Tecentriq in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment of Tecentriq is required in 
patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  
Asian patients 
Due to increased haematologic toxicities observed in Asian patients in IMpower150, it is 
recommended that the starting dose of paclitaxel should be 175 mg/m2 every three weeks. 
Renal impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are 
too limited to draw conclusions on this population. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild 
or moderate hepatic impairment. Tecentriq has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2 
Patients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2 were excluded from the clinical trials in NSCLC, TNBC, 
ES-SCLC, 2nd line UC and HCC (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Method of administration  
It is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation (intravenous or 
subcutaneous) is being administered to the patient, as prescribed. 
Tecentriq intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be 
administered via an intravenous infusion only. The infusions must not be administered as an 
intravenous push or bolus. 
The initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. 
For instructions on dilution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to atezolizumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most immune-mediated adverse reactions occurring during treatment with atezolizumab were 
reversible with interruptions of atezolizumab and initiation of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system have been observed. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions with atezolizumab may occur after the last dose of atezolizumab. 
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, thorough evaluation to confirm aetiology or 
exclude other causes should be performed. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab 
should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid 
should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical trials in patients whose 
immune-mediated adverse reactions could not be controlled with systemic corticosteroid use, 
administration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. 
Atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction 
that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that 
are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis  
Cases of pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab 
(see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes 
other than immune-mediated pneumonitis should be ruled out. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 1 to 2 mg/kg 
body weight (bw)/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the 
event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis. 
Immune-mediated hepatitis  
Cases of hepatitis, some leading to fatal outcomes have been observed in clinical trials with 
atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis. 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin should be monitored 
prior to initiation of treatment, periodically during treatment with atezolizumab and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation. 
For patients without HCC, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if Grade 2 event (ALT or 
AST > 3 to 5 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) persists for more than 5 to 7 days, and 1 to 
2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event improves to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month.  
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and 
corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 events (ALT or AST 
> 5.0 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 3 x ULN). 
For patients with HCC, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if ALT or AST increases to 
> 3 to ≤ 10 x ULN from normal limits at baseline, or > 5 to ≤ 10 x ULN from > 1 ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN 
at baseline, or > 8 to ≤ 10 x ULN from > 3 ULN to ≤ 5 x ULN at baseline, and persists for more than 5 
to 7 days, and 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event 
improves to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month.  
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and 
corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued if ALT or AST increases to > 10 x ULN or total 
bilirubin increases > 3 x ULN). 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Cases of diarrhoea or colitis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis.  
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 stools/day 
over baseline) or colitis (symptomatic). For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, if symptoms persist > 5 days 
or recur, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. For 
Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day 
methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 
1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the 
event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade 4 (life threatening; urgent intervention indicated) diarrhoea or colitis. The potential 
complication of gastrointestinal perforation associated with colitis should be taken into consideration. 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies  
Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
including diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see 
section 4.8).  
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Thyroid function 
should be monitored prior to and periodically during treatment with atezolizumab. Appropriate 
management of patients with abnormal thyroid function tests at baseline should be considered. 
Asymptomatic patients with abnormal thyroid function tests can receive atezolizumab. For 
symptomatic hypothyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and thyroid hormone replacement 
should be initiated as needed. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy and 
without corticosteroids. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and an 
anti-thyroid medicinal product should be initiated as needed. Treatment with atezolizumab may be 
resumed when symptoms are controlled and thyroid function is improving. 
For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with 
intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. 
Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should 
follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. 
Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids 
have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the patient is stable on 
replacement therapy (if required). 
For Grade 2 or Grade 3 hypophysitis, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with intravenous 
corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started, and 
hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 
1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to 
≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent 
per day and the patient is stable on replacement therapy (if required). Treatment with atezolizumab 
should be permanently discontinued for Grade 4 hypophysitis. 
Treatment with insulin should be initiated for type 1 diabetes mellitus. For ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycaemia 
(fasting glucose > 250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L), atezolizumab should be withheld. Treatment with 
atezolizumab may be resumed if metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy.

Immune-mediated meningoencephalitis  
Meningoencephalitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. 
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of meningitis or 
encephalitis. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or 
equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of 
prednisone or equivalent should follow.  
Immune-mediated neuropathies 
Myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be life threatening, 
and facial paresis were observed in patients receiving atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for 
symptoms of motor and sensory neuropathy.  
Myelitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
closely monitored for signs and symptoms that are suggestive of myelitis.  
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of myasthenic 
syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids (at a 
dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 1 or 2 facial paresis, and treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. 
Treatment may be resumed only if the event fully resolves. Treatment with atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 facial paresis, or any other neuropathy that does not 
fully resolve while withholding atezolizumab. 
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 2, 3 or 4 myelitis.  
Immune-mediated pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, has been observed in clinical 
trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms that are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 serum amylase or lipase levels 
increased (> 2 x ULN), or Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis, and treatment with intravenous 
corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once 
symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed when serum amylase and lipase levels improve to 
≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, or symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved, and corticosteroids have been 
reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for Grade 4, or any grade of recurrent pancreatitis. 
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Cases of myocarditis, including fatal cases, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Myocarditis may also be a 
clinical manifestation of myositis and should be managed accordingly. 
Patients with cardiac or cardiopulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis, to 
ensure the initiation of appropriate measures at an early stage. If myocarditis is suspected, treatment 
with atezolizumab should be withheld, prompt initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 
2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started, and prompt cardiology consultation 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis 
of myocarditis is established, treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade ≥ 2 myocarditis (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated nephritis 
Nephritis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for changes in renal function.  
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 nephritis, and treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, 
and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. 
Immune-mediated myositis  
Cases of myositis, including fatal cases, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myositis. Patients with possible myositis 
should be monitored for signs of myocarditis. 
If a patient develops signs and symptoms of myositis, close monitoring should be implemented, and 
the patient referred to a specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Treatment with 
atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 myositis and corticosteroid therapy (1-2 
mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent) should be initiated. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, taper 
corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event 
improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg oral 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued 
for Grade 4 or grade 3 recurrent myositis, or when unable to reduce the corticosteroid dose to the 
equivalent of ≤ 10 mg prednisone per day within 12 weeks after onset. 
Immune-mediated severe cutaneous adverse reactions  
Immune-mediated severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients receiving 
atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes 
should be excluded. For suspected SCARs, patients should be referred to a specialist for further 
diagnosis and management. 
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 3 skin 
reactions and treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or 
equivalent should be started. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ 
Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent 
per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin reactions, 
and corticosteroids should be administered.  
Atezolizumab should be withheld for patients with suspected SJS or TEN.  For confirmed SJS or TEN, 
atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued.  
Caution should be used when considering the use of atezolizumab in a patient who has previously 
experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immune-
stimulatory anticancer agents. 
Immune-mediated pericardial disorders 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pericardial disorders, including pericarditis, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, some leading 
to fatal outcomes, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of pericardial disorders. 
For suspected Grade 1 pericarditis, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld and prompt 
cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be 
initiated. For suspected Grade ≥ 2 pericardial disorders, treatment with atezolizumab should be 
withheld, prompt treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of 
prednisone or equivalent should be started and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup 
according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of a pericardial disorder 
event is established, treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade ≥ 2 
pericardial disorders (see section 4.2). 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including fatal cases, has been reported in patients 
receiving atezolizumab (see section 4.8). HLH should be considered when the presentation of cytokine 
release syndrome is atypical or prolonged. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of HLH. For suspected HLH, atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued and patients 
should be referred to a specialist for further diagnosis and management. 
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions 
may occur, including noninfective cystitis. 
Evaluate all suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions to exclude other causes. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions and, based on the severity 
of the reaction, managed with treatment modifications and corticosteroids as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.2 and section 4.8). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8).  
The rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment should be interrupted in patients with Grade 1 or 2 
infusion-related reactions. Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 
or 4 infusion-related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions may continue to 
receive atezolizumab with close monitoring; premedication with antipyretic and antihistamines may be 
considered.  
Disease-specific precautions 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC  
Physicians should carefully consider the combined risks of the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin before initiating treatment (see section 4.8). 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in metastatic TNBC 
Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathies occurring during treatment with atezolizumab and nab-
paclitaxel may be reversible with interruptions of nab-paclitaxel. Physicians should consult the nab-
paclitaxel summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for specific precautions and contraindications 
of this medicine. 
Use of atezolizumab in UC for previously untreated patients who are considered cisplatin ineligible 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the IMvigor210 Cohort 1 study population were 
overall comparable to patients in the clinic who would be considered cisplatin ineligible but would be 
eligible for a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. There are insufficient data for the 
subgroup of patients that would be unfit for any chemotherapy; therefore atezolizumab should be used 
with caution in these patients, after careful consideration of the potential balance of risks and benefits 
on an individual basis. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  
Patients with NSCLC that had clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear 
cavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging, were excluded from the pivotal clinical trial 
IMpower150 after several cases of fatal pulmonary haemorrhage were observed, which is a known 
risk factor of treatment with bevacizumab.  
In the absence of data, atezolizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful 
evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients 
with NSCLC who have progressed on erlotinib+bevacizumab 
In study IMpower150, there are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients who have progressed previously on 
erlotinib+bevacizumab.  
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in HCC 
Data in HCC patients with Child-Pugh B liver disease treated with atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab are very limited and there are currently no data available in HCC patients with Child-
Pugh C liver disease.  
Patients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, and cases of severe 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including fatal events, were reported in patients with HCC treated with 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. In patients with HCC, screening for and subsequent 
treatment of oesophageal varices should be performed as per clinical practice prior to starting 
treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding with the combination 
treatment. Please refer to the bevacizumab Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Diabetes mellitus can occur during treatment with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. 
Physicians should monitor blood glucose levels prior to and periodically during treatment with 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as clinically indicated. 
Use of atezolizumab as monotherapy for first-line treatment in metastatic NSCLC  
Physicians should consider the delayed onset of atezolizumab effect before initiating first-line 
treatment as monotherapy in patients with NSCLC. A higher number of deaths within 2.5 months after 
randomisation followed by a long-term survival benefit was observed with atezolizumab compared 
with chemotherapy. No specific factor(s) associated with early deaths could be identified (see section 
5.1). 
Patients excluded from clinical trials 
Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: a history of autoimmune 
disease, history of pneumonitis, active brain metastasis, HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (for 
non-HCC patients), significant cardiovascular disease and patients with inadequate hematologic and 
end-organ function. Patients who were administered a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enrolment; systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive 
medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to study entry; therapeutic oral or intravenous antibiotics 
within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment were excluded from clinical trials.  
Patient card 
The prescriber must discuss the risks of Tecentriq therapy with the patient. The patient will be 
provided with the patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. Since 
atezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions 
are expected.  
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be 
avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of 
atezolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat 
immune-mediated adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after 
treatment with atezolizumab. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of atezolizumab in pregnant women. No developmental and 
reproductive studies were conducted with atezolizumab. Animal studies have demonstrated that 
inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in murine pregnancy models can lead to immune-mediated 
rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3). These results indicate a 
potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that administration of atezolizumab during pregnancy 
could cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth.  
Human immunoglobulins G1 (IgG1) are known to cross the placental barrier and atezolizumab is an 
IgG1; therefore, atezolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing 
foetus.  
Atezolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with atezolizumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether atezolizumab is excreted in human milk. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal 
antibody and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue Tecentriq therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and 
the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of atezolizumab on fertility. No reproductive and 
development toxicity studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however, based on the 26-week 
repeat dose toxicity study, atezolizumab had an effect on menstrual cycles at an estimated AUC 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose and was reversible (see 
section 5.3). There were no effects on the male reproductive organs. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tecentriq has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue 
should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of atezolizumab as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 4 739 patients across multiple 
tumour types. The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) were fatigue (29.9%), decreased appetite 
(20.0%), rash (20.0%), nausea (19.4%), diarrhoea (18.4%), pyrexia (18.3%), cough (18.1%), arthralgia 
(16.6%), dyspnoea (16.4%), pruritus (13.7%), asthenia (12.9%), back pain (12.5%), vomiting (11.9%), 
urinary tract infection (11.1%) and headache (10.5%). 
The safety of atezolizumab given in combination with other medicinal products, has been evaluated in 
4 535 patients across multiple tumour types. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were 
anaemia (36.8%), neutropenia (36.6%), nausea (35.5%), fatigue (33.1%), alopecia (28.1%), rash 
(27.8%), diarrhoea (27.6%), thrombocytopenia (27.1%), constipation (25.8%), decreased appetite 
(24.7%) and peripheral neuropathy (24.4%). 
Use of atezolizumab in the adjuvant NSCLC setting  
The safety profile of atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patient population (IMpower010) was generally consistent with the overall pooled monotherapy safety 
profile in the advanced setting. Nevertheless, the incidence of immune-mediated adverse reactions of 
atezolizumab in IMpower010 was 51.7% compared to 38.4% in the pooled monotherapy population 
with advanced disease. No new immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified in the adjuvant 
setting. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  
In the first-line NSCLC study (IMpower150), an overall higher frequency of adverse events was 
observed in the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin 
compared to atezolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, including Grade 3 and 4 events (63.6% 
compared to 57.5%), Grade 5 events (6.1% compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to 
atezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as well as adverse events leading to withdrawal of any 
study treatment (33.8% compared to 13.3%). Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal 
inflammation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, hypertension and proteinuria were reported 
higher (≥5% difference) in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, 
paclitaxel and carboplatin. Other clinically significant adverse events which were observed more 
frequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were epistaxis, 
haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events. 
Further details on serious adverse reactions are provided in section 4.4.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The adverse reactions (ARs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories of 
frequency in Table 3 for atezolizumab given as monotherapy or as combination therapy. Adverse 
reactions known to occur with atezolizumab or chemotherapies given alone may occur during 
treatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in 
clinical trials with combination therapy. The following categories of frequency have been used: very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to 
< 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The data below reflect information for significant adverse reactions for atezolizumab as monotherapy 
in clinical trials (see section 5.1). Details for the significant adverse reactions for atezolizumab when 
given in combination are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to 
atezolizumab monotherapy. The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in 
sections 4.2 and 4.4.

median time to onset was 3.5 months (range: 12 days to 11.5 months). The median duration was 3.2 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months (range: 9 days to 51.1+ months; + denotes a censored value). Myositis led to discontinuation 
of atezolizumab in 6 (0.1%) patients. Seven (0.1%) patients required the use of corticosteroids. 
Immune-mediated severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) occurred in 0.6% (30/4 739) of patients who received 
atezolizumab monotherapy. Of the 30 patients, one experienced a fatal event. The median time to 
onset was 4.8 months (range: 3 days to 15.5 months). The median duration was 2.4 months (range: 1 
day to 37.5+ months; + denotes a censored value). SCARs led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in 3 
(< 0.1%) patients. SCARs requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids occurred in 0.2% (9/4 739) of 
patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. 
Immune-mediated pericardial disorders 
Pericardial disorders occurred in 1.0% (48/4 739) of patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy. 
The median time to onset was 1.4 months (range: 6 days to 17.5 months). The median duration was 
1.4 months (range: 1 day to 51.5+ months; + denotes a censored value). Pericardial disorders led to 
discontinuation of Tecentriq in 3 (< 0.1%) patients. Pericardial disorders requiring the use of 
corticosteroids occurred in 0.1% (7/4 739) of patients. 
Immunogenicity 
Across multiple phase II and III studies, 13.1% to 54.1% of patients developed treatment-emergent 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Patients who developed treatment-emergent ADAs tended to have 
overall poorer health and disease characteristics at baseline. Those imbalances in health and disease 
characteristics at baseline can confound the interpretation of pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and safety 
analyses. Exploratory analyses adjusting for imbalances in baseline health and disease characteristics 
were conducted to assess the effect of ADA on efficacy. These analyses did not exclude possible 
attenuation of efficacy benefit in patients who developed ADA compared to patients who did not 
develop ADA. The median time to ADA onset ranged from 3 weeks to 5 weeks. 
Across pooled datasets for patients treated with atezolizumab monotherapy (N=3 460) and with 
combination therapies (N= 2 285), the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for 
the ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: Grade 3-4 AEs 
46.2% vs. 39.4%, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 39.6% vs. 33.3%, AEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal 8.5% vs 7.8% (for monotherapy); Grade 3-4 AEs 63.9% vs. 60.9%, SAEs 43.9% vs. 
35.6%, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 22.8% vs 18.4% (for combination therapy). However, 
available data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse reactions.  
Paediatric population 
The safety of atezolizumab in children and adolescents has not been established. No new safety signals 
were observed in a clinical trial with 69 paediatric patients (< 18 years) and the safety profile was 
comparable to adults. 
Elderly 
No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger 
patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with an 
increased risk of developing adverse events in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
In studies IMpower150, IMpower133 and IMpower110, data for patients ≥ 75 years of age are too 
limited to draw conclusions on this population.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no information on overdose with atezolizumab.  
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01FF05 
Mechanism of action 
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) may be expressed on tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating 
immune cells, and can contribute to the inhibition of the antitumour immune response in the tumour 
microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T-cells and antigen 
presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.  
Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that 
directly binds to PD-L1 and provides a dual blockade of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors, releasing 
PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including reactivating the antitumour 
immune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Atezolizumab spares the 
PD-L2/PD-1 interaction allowing PD-L2/PD-1 mediated inhibitory signals to persist.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Urothelial carcinoma 
IMvigor211 (GO29294): Randomised trial in locally advanced or metastatic UC patients previously 
treated with chemotherapy 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, (IMvigor211), was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice 
of vinflunine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who 
progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. This study excluded patients who had 
a history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases; administration 
of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; and administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within 
2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks, 
and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression 
on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression 
subgroups for the analyses described below.  
A total of 931 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either atezolizumab or 
chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), PD-L1 
expression status on IC (< 5% vs. ≥ 5%), number of prognostic risk factors (0 vs. 1-3), and liver 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metastases (yes vs. no). Prognostic risk factors included time from prior chemotherapy of < 3 months, 
ECOG performance status > 0 and haemoglobin < 10 g/dL. 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
No dose reduction of atezolizumab was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as 
assessed by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Vinflunine was administered 320 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Paclitaxel was administered 175 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 3 hours on day 1 of each 3-week 
cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 2.8 months for the atezolizumab arm, 
2.1 months for the vinflunine and paclitaxel arms and 1.6 months for the docetaxel arm. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well 
balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years (range: 31 to 88), and 77.1% of 
patients were male. The majority of patients were white (72.1%), 53.9% of patients within the 
chemotherapy arm received vinflunine, 71.4% of patients had at least one poor prognostic risk factor 
and 28.8% had liver metastases at baseline. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (45.6%) or 1 
(54.4%). Bladder was the primary tumour site for 71.1% of patients and 25.4% of patients had upper 
tract UC. There were 24.2% of patients who received only prior platinum-containing adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant therapy and progressed within 12 months. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for IMvigor211 is overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints 
evaluated per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 are 
objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). 
Comparisons with respect to OS between the treatment arm and control arm within the IC2/3, IC1/2/3, 
and ITT (Intention-to-treat, i.e. all comers) populations were tested using a hierarchical fixed-sequence 
procedure based on a stratified log-rank test at two-sided level of 5% as follows: step 1) IC2/3 
population; step 2) IC1/2/3 population; step 3) all comers population. OS results for each of steps 2 
and 3 could be formally tested for statistical significance only if the result in the preceding step was 
statistically significant. 
The median survival follow-up is 17 months. The primary analysis of study IMvigor211 did not meet 
its primary endpoint of OS. Atezolizumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival 
benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic 
UC. Per the pre-specified hierarchical testing order, the IC2/3 population was tested first, with an OS 
HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.21; median OS of 11.1 vs. 10.6 months for atezolizumab and 
chemotherapy respectively). The stratified log-rank p-value was 0.41 and therefore the results are 
considered not statistically significant in this population. As a consequence, no formal tests of 
statistical significance could be performed for OS in the IC1/2/3 or all comer populations, and results 
of those analyses would be considered exploratory. The key results in the all comer population are 
summarised in Table 4. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the all comer population is presented in 
Figure 1. 
An exploratory updated survival analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow up 
of 34 months in the ITT population. The median OS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.8, 9.6) in the 
atezolizumab arm and 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.2, 8.6) in the chemotherapy arm with a hazard ratio of 
0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). Consistent with the trend observed at primary analysis for 12-month OS 
rates, numerically higher 24-month and 30-month OS rates were observed for patients in the 
atezolizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy arm in the ITT population. The percentage of 
patients alive at 24 months (KM estimate) was 12.7% in the chemotherapy arm and 22.5% in the 
atezolizumab arm; and at 30 months (KM estimate) was 9.8% in the chemotherapy arm and 18.1% in 
the atezolizumab arm.

IMvigor210 (GO29293): Single-arm trial in previously untreated urothelial carcinoma patients who 
are ineligible for cisplatin therapy and in urothelial carcinoma patients previously treated with 
chemotherapy 
A phase II, multi-centre, international, two-cohort, single-arm clinical trial, IMvigor210, was 
conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC (also known as urothelial bladder 
cancer).  
The study enrolled a total of 438 patients and had two patient cohorts. Cohort 1 included previously 
untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were ineligible or unfit for 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy or had disease progression at least 12 months after treatment with a 
platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Cohort 2 included patients who 
received at least one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic UC or 
had disease progression within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. 
In Cohort 1, 119 patients were treated with atezolizumab 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 
3 weeks until disease progression. The median age was 73 years. Most patients were male (81%), and 
the majority of patients were White (91%).  
Cohort 1 included 45 patients (38%) with ECOG performance status of 0, 50 patients (42%) with 
ECOG performance status of 1 and 24 patients (20%) with ECOG performance status of 2, 35 patients 
(29%) with no Bajorin risk factors (ECOG performance status ≥ 2 and visceral metastasis), 66 patients 
(56%) with one Bajorin risk factor and 18 patients (15 %) with two Bajorin risk factors, 84 patients 
(71%) with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min), and 25 patients 
(21%) with liver metastasis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort 1 was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as assessed 
by an independent review facility (IRF) using RECIST v1.1.  
The primary analysis was performed when all patients had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. Median 
duration of treatment was 15.0 weeks and median duration of survival follow-up was 8.5 months in all 
comers. Clinically relevant IRF-assessed ORRs per RECIST v1.1 were shown; however, when 
compared to a pre-specified historical control response rate of 10%, statistical significance was not 
reached for the primary endpoint. The confirmed ORRs per IRF-RECIST v1.1 were 21.9% (95% CI: 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.3, 40.0) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 18.8% (95% CI: 10.9, 29.0) in patients with PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%, and 19.3% (95% CI: 12.7, 27.6) in all comers. The median duration of response 
(DOR) was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all comers. OS was not mature with 
an event patient ratio of approximately 40%. Median OS for all patient subgroups (PD-L1 expression 
≥ 5 % and ≥ 1 %) and in all comers was 10.6 months.  
An updated analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow-up of 17.2 months for 
Cohort 1 and is summarised in Table 5. The median DOR was not reached in any PD-L1 expression 
subgroup or in all comers.

In Cohort 2, the co-primary efficacy endpoints were confirmed ORR as assessed by an IRF using 
RECIST v1.1 and investigator-assessed ORR according to Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria. 
There were 310 patients treated with atezolizumab 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks 
until loss of clinical benefit. The primary analysis of Cohort 2 was performed when all patients had at 
least 24 weeks of follow-up. The study met its co-primary endpoints in Cohort 2, demonstrating 
statistically significant ORRs per IRF-assessed RECIST v1.1 and investigator-assessed mRECIST 
compared to a pre-specified historical control response rate of 10%. 
An analysis was also performed with a median duration of survival follow-up of 21.1 months for 
Cohort 2. The confirmed ORRs per IRF-RECIST v1.1 were 28.0% (95% CI: 19.5, 37.9) in patients 
with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 19.3% (95% CI: 14.2, 25.4) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, 
and 15.8% (95% CI: 11.9, 20.4) in all comers. The confirmed ORR per investigator-assessed 
mRECIST was 29.0% (95% CI: 20.4, 38.9) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 23.7% (95% CI:

18.1, 30.1) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and 19.7% (95% CI: 15.4, 24.6) in all comers. 
The rate of complete response per IRF-RECIST v1.1 in the all comer population was 6.1% (95% CI: 
3.7, 9.4). For Cohort 2, median DOR was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all 
comers, however was reached in patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% (13.3 months; 95% CI 4.2, 
NE). The OS rate at 12 months was 37% in all comers.  
IMvigor130 (WO30070): Phase III study of atezolizumab monotherapy and in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma 
A phase III, multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, partially blinded (Arms A and C only) 
study, IMvigor130, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab + platinum-
based combination chemotherapy (i.e., either cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine), Arm A, or 
atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm B, open-label arm) versus placebo + platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy (Arm C) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who had not received prior 
systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The co-primary efficacy outcomes were investigator-
assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in Arm A versus Arm C and overall survival (OS) in Arm A 
versus C and then Arm B versus C, analyzed in a hierarchical fashion. Overall survival was not 
statistically significant for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C, and thus no further formal testing 
could be conducted per the pre-defined hierarchical testing order. 
Based on an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) recommendation following an early 
review of survival data, accrual of patients on the atezolizumab monotherapy treatment arm whose 
tumours had a low PD-L1 expression (less than 5% of immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry using VENTANA PD-L1 [SP142] assay) was stopped after observing 
decreased overall survival for this subgroup at an unplanned early analysis, however, this occurred 
after the vast majority of patients had already been enrolled. 
Out of 719 patients enrolled in the atezolizumab monotherapy (n=360) and chemotherapy alone 
(n=359) arms, 50 and 43 patients, respectively, were cisplatin-ineligible by Galsky criteria and had 
tumours with high PD-L1 expression (≥ 5% of immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry using VENTANA PD-L1 [SP142] assay). In an exploratory analysis in this 
subgroup of patients, the unstratified HR for OS was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.91). The median OS was 
18.6 months (95% CI: 14.0, 49.4) in the atezolizumab monotherapy arm vs. 10.0 months (95% CI: 7.4, 
18.1) in the chemotherapy alone arm (see Figure 2).

Non-small cell lung cancer  
Adjuvant treatment of early-stage NSCLC 
IMpower010 (GO29527): Randomised phase III trial in patients with resected NSCLC after cisplatin-
based chemotherapy 
A phase III, open label, multi-centre, randomised study, GO29527 (IMpower010), was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IB 
(tumours ≥ 4 cm) – IIIA NSCLC (per the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint 
Committee on Cancer staging system, 7th edition).  
The following selection criteria define patients with high risk of recurrence who are included in the 
therapeutic indication and are reflective of the patient population with stage II – IIIA according to the 
7th edition staging system: 
Tumour size ≥ 5 cm; or tumours of any size that are either accompanied by N1 or N2 status; or 
tumours that are invasive of thoracic structures (directly invade the parietal pleura, chest wall, 
diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, 
trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina); or tumours that involve the 
main bronchus < 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement of the carina; or tumours that are 
associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung; or tumours with separate 
nodule(s) in the same lobe or different ipsilateral lobe as the primary. 
The study did not include patients who had N2 status with tumours invading the mediastinum, heart, 
great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina, or with separate 
tumour nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe. 
A total of 1 280 enrolled patients had complete tumour resection and were eligible to receive up to 4 
cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are described in 
Table 6. 
Table 6: Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (IMpower010) 
Adjuvant cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy:  
Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenous on 
Day 1 of each 21 day cycle with one 
of the following treatment regimens 
Vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 intravenous, Days 1 and 8 
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenous, Day 1 
Gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 intravenous, Days 1 and 8 
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenous, Day 1(non-squamous) 
After completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (up to four cycles), a total of 1 005 patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab (Arm A) or best supportive care (BSC) (Arm B). 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by IV infusion every 3 weeks for 16 
cycles unless there was disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by 
sex, stage of disease, histology, and PD-L1 expression.  
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, 
attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation; administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 
weeks prior to randomisation. Tumour assessments were conducted at baseline of the randomisation 
phase and every 4 months for the first year following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 6 months until 
year five, then annually thereafter.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in the ITT population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 62 years (range: 26 to 84), and 67% of patients were 
male. The majority of patients were White (73%), and 24% were Asian. Most patients were current or 
previous smokers (78%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (55%) or 1 (44%). 
Overall, 12% of patients had stage IB, 47% had stage II and 41% had stage IIIA disease. The 
percentage of patients who had tumours with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and ≥ 50% on TC as measured 
by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay was 55% and 26%, respectively.  
The primary efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by the 
investigator. DFS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of occurrence of 
any of the following: first documented recurrence of disease, new primary NSCLC, or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurred first. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate DFS in the PD-L1 
≥ 1% TC stage II  – IIIA patient population. Key secondary efficacy objectives were to evaluate DFS 
in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – IIIA patient population and overall survival (OS) in the ITT 
population. 
At the time of the interim DFS analysis, the study met its primary endpoint. The median follow-up 
time was approximately 32 months. In the analysis of patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II  – IIIA 
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n = 209), a clinically meaningful improvement in 
DFS in the atezolizumab arm was observed compared to the BSC arm (Table 7). The OS data were 
immature at the time of the DFS interim analysis with approximately 16.3 % of deaths overall reported 
in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – IIIA patient population, without EGFR mutations and ALK 
rearrangements. An exploratory analysis of OS suggested a trend in favor of atezolizumab over BSC, 
with a stratified HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.82) in this patient population. 
The key efficacy results for the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II  – IIIA patient population, without EGFR 
mutations and ALK rearrangements, are summarised in Table 7. The Kaplan-Meier curve for DFS is 
presented in Figure 3.

The observed DFS improvement in the atezolizumab arm compared with the BSC arm was 
consistently shown across the majority of pre-specified subgroups in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – 
IIIA patient population without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, including both non-
squamous NSCLC patients (unstratified HR of 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.69; median DFS NE vs. 35.7 
months) and squamous NSCLC patients (unstratified HR of 0.60, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.26; median DFS 
36.7 vs. NE months).  
First-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC 
IMpower150 (GO29436): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC, in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, IMpower150, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with 
or without bevacizumab, in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.  
Patients were excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live, attenuated 
vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents 
within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to 
randomisation, active or untreated CNS metastases, clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great 
vessels or clear cavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks 
thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression 
subgroups for the analyses described below.  
A total of 1 202 patients were enrolled and were randomised (1:1:1) to receive one of the treatment 
regimens described in Table 8. Randomisation was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases and 
PD-L1 tumour expression on TC and IC.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 63 years (range: 31 to 90), and 60% of patients were 
male. The majority of patients were white (82%). Approximately 10% of patients had known EGFR 
mutation, 4% had known ALK rearrangements, 14% had liver metastasis at baseline, and most 
patients were current or previous smokers (80%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%) or 
1 (57%). 51% of patients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% TC or ≥ 1% IC and 49% of 
patients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of < 1% TC and < 1% IC. 
At the time of the final analysis for PFS, patients had a median follow up time of 15.3 months. The 
ITT population, including patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements who should have 
been previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, demonstrated clinically meaningful PFS 
improvement in Arm B as compared to Arm C (HR of 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.72; median PFS 8.3 vs. 
6.8 months).   
At the time of the interim OS analysis, patients had a median follow-up of 19.7 months. The key 
results from this analysis as well as from the updated PFS analysis in the ITT population are 
summarised in Tables 9 and 10. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the ITT population is presented in 
Figure 4. Figure 5 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups. Updated PFS results 
are also presented in Figures 6 and 7.

In Arm B as compared to Arm C, pre-specified subgroup analyses from the interim OS analysis 
showed an OS improvement for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (hazard ratio 
[HR] of 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.03; median OS not reached vs. 17.5 months), and liver metastases (HR 
of 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.82; median OS 13.3 vs. 9.4 months). PFS improvements were also shown in 
patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (HR of 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.87; median PFS 
10.0 vs. 6.1 months) and liver metastases (HR of 0.41, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.62; median PFS 8.2 vs. 5.4 
months). OS results were similar for patients aged < 65 and ≥ 65 subgroups, respectively. Data for 
patients ≥ 75 years of age are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. For all subgroup 
analyses, formal statistical testing was not planned.  
IMpower130 (GO29537): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin 
A phase III, open-label, randomised study, GO29537 (IMpower130), was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, in 
chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with EGFR mutations or 
ALK rearrangements should have been previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Patients were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. 
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease, administration of live, attenuated 
vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of immunostimulatory agents within 
4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to randomisation, 
and active or untreated CNS metastases. Patients who had prior treatment with CD137 agonists or 
immune checkpoint blockade therapies (anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies) were not 
eligible. However, patients who had prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment could be enrolled, as long as the last 
dose was received at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation, and there was no history of severe immune-
mediated adverse events from anti-CTLA-4 (NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4). Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, then every 9 weeks thereafter. 
Tumour specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour infiltrating 
immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression subgroups for the analyses 
described below. 
Patients, including those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, were enrolled and were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the treatment regimens described in Table 11. 
Randomisation was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases and PD-L1 expression on TC and 
IC. Patients receiving treatment regimen B were able to crossover and receive atezolizumab 
monotherapy following disease progression.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population defined as ITT-WT 
(n=679) were well balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 18 to 
86 years). The majority of the patients were male (59%) and white (90%). Fourteen point seven 
percent of patients had liver metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous 
smokers (90%). The majority of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 1 (59%) and PD-
L1 expression < 1% (approximately 52%). Among 107 Arm B patients who had a response status of 
stable disease, partial response, or complete response after induction therapy, 40 received pemetrexed 
switch maintenance therapy.  
The primary analysis was conducted in all patients, excluding those with EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements, defined as ITT-WT population (n=679). Patients had a median survival follow up 
time of 18.6 months and showed improved OS and PFS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and 
carboplatin as compared to the control. The key results are summarised in Table 12 and Kaplan-Meier 
curves for OS and PFS are presented in Figures 8 and 10, respectively. The exploratory results of OS 
and PFS by PD-L1 expression are summarised in Figures 9 and 11, respectively. Patients with liver 
metastases did not show improved PFS or OS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, 
compared to nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin (HR of 0.93, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.47 for PFS and HR of 1.04, 
95% CI: 0.63, 1.72 for OS, respectively). 
Fifty-nine percent of patients in the nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin arm received any cancer 
immunotherapy after disease progression, which includes atezolizumab as crossover treatment (41% 
of all patients), compared to 7.3% of patients in the atezolizumab, nab paclitaxel and carboplatin arm. 
In an exploratory analysis with longer follow up (median: 24.1 months), the median OS for both arms 
was unchanged relative to the primary analysis, with HR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01).

IMpower110 (GO29431): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
NSCLC  
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, randomised study, IMpower110, was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic NSCLC. Patients 
had PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC (PD-L1 stained ≥ 1% of tumour cells) or ≥ 1% IC (PD-L1 stained 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells covering ≥ 1% of the tumour area) based on the VENTANA PD-L1 
(SP142) Assay. 
A total of 572 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab (Arm A) or 
chemotherapy (Arm B). Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator or unacceptable 
toxicity. The chemotherapy regimens are described in Table 13. Randomisation was stratified by sex, 
ECOG performance status, histology, and PD-L1 tumour expression on TC and IC.

c Gemcitabine is administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle 
d No crossover was allowed from the control arm (platinum-based chemotherapy) to the atezolizumab 
arm (Arm A)  
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, 
attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 
2 weeks prior to randomisation, active or untreated CNS metastases. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks 
thereafter.  
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC or 
≥ 1% IC who do not have EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=554) were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 64.5 years (range: 30 to 87), and 70% of patients 
were male. The majority of patients were white (84%) and Asian (14%). Most patients were current or 
previous smokers (87%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (36%) or 1 (64%). 
Overall, 69% of patients had non-squamous disease and 31% of patients had squamous disease. The 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics in patients with high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 
≥ 50% TC or ≥ 10% IC) who do not have with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=205) were 
generally representative of the broader study population and were balanced between the treatment 
arms. 
The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). At the time of the interim OS analysis, patients with 
high PD-L1 expression excluding those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=205) 
showed statistically significant improvement in OS for the patients randomised to atezolizumab (Arm 
A) as compared with chemotherapy (Arm B) (HR of 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; median OS of 20.2 
months vs 13.1 months) with a two-sided p-value of 0.0106. The median survival follow-up time in 
patients with high PD-L1 expression was 15.7 months.  
In an exploratory OS analysis with longer follow up (median: 31.3 months) for these patients, the 
median OS for the atezolizumab arm was unchanged relative to the primary OS interim analysis (20.2 
months) and was 14.7 months for the chemotherapy arm (HR of 0.76, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.09). The key 
results at the exploratory analysis are summarised in Table 14. The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and 
PFS in patients with high PD-L1 expression are presented in Figures 12 and 13. A higher proportion of 
patients experienced death within the first 2.5 months in the atezolizumab arm (16/107, 15.0%) as 
compared to the chemotherapy arm (10/98, 10.2%). No specific factor(s) associated with early deaths 
could be identified.

Second-line treatment of NSCLC 
OAK (GO28915): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients 
previously treated with chemotherapy 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, OAK, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. 
This study excluded patients who had a history of autoimmune disease, active or 
corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days 
prior to enrolment, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic 
immunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were 
evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour-infiltrating immune 
cells (IC). 
A total of 1 225 patients were enrolled and per the analysis plan the first 850 randomised patients were 
included in the primary efficacy analysis. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression status on 
IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and by histology. Patients were randomised (1:1) 
to receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel. 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
No dose reduction was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the 
investigator. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week 
cycle until disease progression. For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 
2.1 months for the docetaxel arm and 3.4 months for the atezolizumab arm.  
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well 
balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 33 to 85), and 61% of 
patients were male. The majority of patients were white (70%). Approximately three-quarters of 
patients had non-squamous histology (74%), 10% had known EGFR mutation, 0.2% had known ALK 
rearrangements, 10% had CNS metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous 
smokers (82%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (37%) or 1 (63%). Seventy-five percent of 
patients received only one prior platinum-based therapeutic regimen. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The key results of this study with a median survival follow-up 
of 21 months are summarised in Table 15. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in the ITT population are 
presented in Figure 14. Figure 15 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups, 
demonstrating OS benefit with atezolizumab in all subgroups, including those with PD-L1 
expression < 1% in TC and IC.

An improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel in both non-squamous 
NSCLC patients (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89; median OS of 15.6 vs. 11.2 months 
for atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively) and squamous NSCLC patients (HR of 0.73, 
95% CI: 0.54, 0.98; median OS of 8.9 vs. 7.7 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively). 
The observed OS improvement was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients including 
those with brain metastases at baseline (HR of 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.94; median OS of 20.1 
vs. 11.9 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel respectively) and patients who were never smokers 
(HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.08; median OS of 16.3 vs. 12.6 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, 
respectively). However, patients with EGFR mutations did not show improved OS with atezolizumab 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to docetaxel (HR of 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71, 2.18; median OS of 10.5 vs. 16.2 months for 
atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively).  
Prolonged time to deterioration of patient-reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC 
QLQ-LC13 was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel (HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; 
median not reached in either arm). The time to deterioration in other lung cancer symptoms (i.e. 
cough, dyspnoea, and arm/shoulder pain) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was similar 
between atezolizumab and docetaxel. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the open-
label design of the study. 
POPLAR (GO28753): Randomised phase II trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients 
previously treated with chemotherapy 
A phase II, multi-centre, international, randomised, open-label, controlled study, POPLAR, was 
conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following 
a platinum-containing regimen, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The primary efficacy outcome was 
overall survival. A total of 287 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab (1 200 mg 
by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression). Randomisation was 
stratified by PD-L1 expression status on IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens and by 
histology. An updated analysis with a total of 200 deaths observed and a median survival follow-up of 
22 months showed a median OS of 12.6 months in patients treated with atezolizumab, vs. 9.7 months 
in patients treated with docetaxel (HR of 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92). ORR was 15.3% vs. 14.7% and 
median DOR was 18.6 months vs. 7.2 months for atezolizumab vs. docetaxel, respectively.  
Small cell lung cancer 
IMpower133 (GO30081): Randomised phase I/III trial in patients with chemotherapy-naïve extensive-
stage SCLC, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide 
A Phase I/III, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, IMpower133, was 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and 
etoposide in patients with chemotherapy-naïve ES-SCLC. 
Patients were excluded if they had active or untreated CNS metastases; history of autoimmune disease; 
administration of live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation; administration of 
systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 1 week prior to randomisation. Tumour 
assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then 
every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients who met established criteria and who agreed to be treated beyond 
disease progression had tumour assessments conducted every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation. 
A total of 403 patients were enrolled and randomised (1:1) to receive one of the treatment regimens 
described in Table 16. Randomisation was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, and presence 
of brain metastases.

The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 26 to 90 years) with 10% of patients 
≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (65%), white (80%), and 9% had brain 
metastases and most patients were current or previous smokers (97%). Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). 
At the time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 13.9 months. A 
statistically significant improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin and etoposide compared to the control arm (HR of 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.91; median OS of 
12.3 months vs. 10.3 months). In the exploratory OS final analysis with longer follow up (median: 
22.9 months), the median OS for both arms was unchanged relative to the primary OS interim 
analysis. The PFS, ORR and DOR results from the primary analysis as well as the exploratory OS 
final analysis results are summarised in Table 17. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS are presented 
in Figures 16 and 17. Data for patients with brain metastases are too limited to draw conclusions on 
this population.

Triple-negative breast cancer 
IMpassion130 (WO29522): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC 
patients previously untreated for metastatic disease  
A phase III, double-blind, two-arm, multi-centre, international, randomised, placebo-controlled study, 
IMpassion130, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who had not 
received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients had to be eligible for taxane monotherapy 
(i.e. absence of rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or need for rapid 
symptom and/or disease control) and were excluded if they had received prior chemotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting within the last 12 months, a history of autoimmune disease; 
administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation, administration of 
systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal 
products within 2 weeks prior to randomisation; untreated, symptomatic or corticosteroid-dependent 
brain metastases. Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 
12 months after Cycle 1, day 1 and every 12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter. 
A total of 902 patients were enrolled and stratified by presence of liver metastases, prior taxane 
treatment, and by PD-L1 expression status in tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) (PD-L1 stained 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC] < 1% of tumour area vs. ≥ 1% of the tumour area) assessed by 
the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay. 
Patients were randomised to receive atezolizumab 840 mg or placebo by intravenous infusions on 
days 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle, plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) administered via intravenous 
infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients received treatment until radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1, or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with atezolizumab could be 
continued when nab-paclitaxel was stopped due to unacceptable toxicity. The median number of 
treatment cycles was 7 for atezolizumab and 6 for nab-paclitaxel in each treatment arm. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. Most patients were women (99.6%), 67.5% were white and 17.8% Asian. 
The median age was 55 years (range: 20-86). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (58.4%) 
or 1 (41.3%). Overall, 41% of enrolled patients had PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, 27% had liver metastases 
and 7% asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline. Approximately half the patients had received a 
taxane (51%) or anthracycline (54%) in the (neo)adjuvant setting. Patient demographics and baseline 
tumour disease in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% were generally representative of the broader 
study population. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in 
the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% per RECIST v1.1 as well as overall 
survival (OS) in the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1.  
PFS, ORR and DOR results of IMpassion130 for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% at the time of 
the final analysis for PFS with a median survival follow up of 13 months are summarised in Table 18 
with Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS in Figure 18. Patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% did not show 
improved PFS when atezolizumab was added to nab-paclitaxel (HR of 0.94, 95% CI 0.78, 1.13). 
The final OS analysis was performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% with a median follow up 
of 19.12 months. OS results are presented in Table 18 and Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 19. Patients 
with PD-L1 expression < 1% did not show improved OS when atezolizumab was added to nab-
paclitaxel (HR of 1.02, 95% CI 0.84, 1.24).  
Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, exploring 
prior (neo)adjuvant treatment, BRCA1/2 mutation and asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline.  
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients who had received prior (neo) adjuvant treatment (n=242), the hazard ratio for primary 
(final) PFS was 0.79 and 0.77 for final OS while in patients who had not received prior (neo)adjuvant 
treatment (n=127), the hazard ratio for primary (final) PFS was 0.44 and 0.54 for final OS.  
In the IMpassion130 study, of the 614 patients tested, 89 (15%) carried pathogenic BRCA1/2 
mutations. From the PD-L1+/BRCA1/2 mutant subgroup, 19 patients received atezolizumab plus nab-
paclitaxel and 26 placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Based on exploratory analysis and acknowledging the 
small sample size, the presence of BRCA1/2 mutation does not seem to impact the PFS clinical benefit 
of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. 
There was no evidence of efficacy in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline, 
although the number of patients treated was small; the median PFS was 2.2 months in the 
atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel arm (n=15) compared to 5.6 months in the placebo plus nab-
paclitaxel arm (n=11) (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.57, 3.44).

Hepatocellular carcinoma 
IMbrave150 (YO40245): Randomised phase III trial in patients with unresectable HCC who have not 
received prior systemic therapy, in combination with bevacizumab  
A phase III, randomied, multi-centre, international, open-label study, IMbrave150, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC, who have not received prior systemic 
treatment. A total of 501 patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either atezolizumab (1 200 mg) and 
15 mg/kg bw of bevacizumab every 3 weeks administered by intravenous infusion, or sorafenib 
400 mg orally twice per day. Randomization was stratified by geographic region, macrovascular 
invasion and/or extrashepatic spread, baseline α-fetoprotein (AFP) and ECOG performance status. 
Patients in both arms received treatment until loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients 
could discontinue either atezolizumab or bevacizumab (e.g., due to adverse events) and continue on 
single-agent therapy until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity associated with the single-
agent. 
The study enrolled adults whose disease was not amenable to or progressed after surgical and/or 
locoregional therapies, were Child-Pugh A, ECOG 0/1, and who had not received prior systemic 
treatment. Bleeding (including fatal events) is a known adverse reaction with bevacizumab and upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding is a common and life threatening complication in patients with HCC. Hence, 
patients were required to be evaluated for the presence of varices within 6 months prior to treatment, 
and were excluded if they had variceal bleeding within 6 months prior to treatment, untreated or 
incompletely treated varices with bleeding or high risk of bleeding. For patients with active hepatitis 
B, HBV DNA < 500 IU/mL was required within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, and 
standard anti-HBV treatment for a minimum of 14 days prior to study entry and for the length of 
study. 
Patients were also excluded if they had moderate or severe ascites; history of hepatic encephalopathy; 
known fibrolamellar HCC; sarcomatoid HCC, mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC; active co-
infection of HBV and HCV; history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, attenuated 
vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents 
within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to 
randomization; untreated or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases. Tumour assessments were 
performed every 6 weeks for the first 54 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1, then every 9 weeks 
thereafter.   
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 88 years) and 83% were male. 
The majority of patients were Asian (57%) and white (35%). 40% were from Asia (excluding Japan), 
while 60% were from rest of world. Approximately 75% of patients presented with macrovascular 
invasion and/or extrahepatic spread and 37% had a baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Baseline ECOG 
performance status was 0 (62%) or 1 (38%). The primary risk factors for the development of HCC 
were Hepatitis B virus infection in 48% of patients, Hepatitis C virus infection in 22% of patients, and 
non-viral disease in 31% of patients. HCC was categorized as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage C in 82% of patients, stage B in 16% of patients, and stage A in 3% of patients. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were OS and IRF-assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. At the 
time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 8.6 months. The data 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS as assessed by IRF per RECIST 
v1.1 with atezolizumab + bevacizumab compared to sorafenib. A statistically significant improvement 
was also observed in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by IRF per RECIST v1.1 and HCC 
modified RECIST (mRECIST). The key efficacy results from the primary analysis are summarized in 
Table 19.  
A descriptive updated efficacy analysis was performed with a median survival follow up time of 15.6 
months. The median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI: 17.0, 23.7) in the atezolizumab + bevacizumab 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arm versus 13.4 months (95% CI: 11.4, 16.9) in the sorafenib arm with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52, 
0.85). The median PFS by IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.8, 8.6) in the 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm versus 4.3 months (95% CI: 4.0, 5.6) in the sorafenib arm with a HR 
of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.81). 
The IRF-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was 29.8% (95% CI: 24.8, 35.0) in the 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm and 11.3% (95% CI: 6.9, 17.3) in the sorafenib arm. The median 
duration of response (DOR) by IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 in confirmed responders was 18.1 
months (95% CI: 14.6, NE) in the atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm compared to 14.9 months (95% 
CI: 4.9, 17.0) in the sorafenib arm. 
Kaplan-Meier curves for OS (updated analysis) and PFS (primary analysis) are presented in Figures 20

Efficacy in elderly 
No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger 
patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with a 
diminished effect of atezolizumab in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel.  
In studies IMpower150, IMpower133 and IMpower110, data for patients ≥ 75 years of age are too 
limited to draw conclusions on this population.  
Paediatric population 
An early phase, multi-centre open-label study was conducted in paediatric (< 18 years, n=69) and 
young adult patients (18-30 years, n=18) with relapsed or progressive solid tumours as well as with 
Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 
atezolizumab. Patients were treated with 15 mg/kg bw atezolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks (see 
section 5.2).  
61 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Exposure to atezolizumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range 1 mg/kg bw to 
20 mg/kg bw including the fixed dose 1 200 mg administered every 3 weeks. A population analysis 
that included 472 patients described atezolizumab pharmacokinetics for the dose range: 
1 to 20 mg/kg bw with a linear two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of 840 mg intravenous atezolizumab administered every 2 weeks, 
1 200 mg administered every 3 weeks, and 1 680 mg administered every 4 weeks are the same; 
comparable total exposures are expected to be achieved with these three dosing regimens. A 
population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is obtained after 6 to 9 weeks of 
multiple dosing. The systemic accumulation in area under the curve, maximum concentration and 
trough concentration was 1.91, 1.46 and 2.75-fold, respectively. 
Absorption 
Atezolizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion.  
Distribution 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that central compartment volume of distribution is 
3.28 L and volume at steady-state is 6.91 L in the typical patient. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of atezolizumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by 
catabolism. 
Elimination 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the clearance of atezolizumab is 0.200 L/day and 
the typical terminal elimination half-life is 27 days. 
Special populations 
Based on population PK and exposure-response analyses age (21-89 years), region, ethnicity, renal 
impairment, mild hepatic impairment, level of PD-L1 expression, or ECOG performance status have 
no effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, gender, positive ADA status, albumin 
levels and tumour burden have a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant effect on 
atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments are recommended. 
Elderly 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in elderly patients. The effect of age on the 
pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was assessed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Age was 
not identified as a significant covariate influencing atezolizumab pharmacokinetics based on patients 
of age range of 21-89 years (n=472), and median of 62 years of age. No clinically important difference 
was observed in the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab among patients < 65 years (n=274), patients 
between 65−75 years (n=152) and patients > 75 years (n=46) (see section 4.2). 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetic results from one early-phase, multi-centre open-label study that was conducted 
in paediatric (< 18 years, n=69) and young adult patients (18-30 years, n=18), show that the clearance 
and volume of distribution of atezolizumab were comparable between paediatric patients receiving 
15 mg/kg bw and young adult patients receiving 1 200 mg of atezolizumab every 3 weeks when 
normalized by body weight, with exposure trending lower in paediatric patients as body weight 
decreased. These differences were not associated with a decrease in atezolizumab concentrations 
below the therapeutic target exposure. Data for children < 2 years is limited thus no definitive 
conclusions can be made. 
Renal impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the clearance of 
atezolizumab were found in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 to 
89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=208) or, moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=116) renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=140) renal 
function. Only a few patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=8) (see 
section 4.2). The effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is 
unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no clinically important differences in the clearance of 
atezolizumab observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or 
bilirubin > 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3x 
ULN and any AST) in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ ULN and 
AST ≤ ULN). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 X ULN 
and any AST). Hepatic impairment was defined by the National Cancer Institute-Organ Dysfunction 
Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria of hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.2). The effect of severe 
hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is 
unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of 
atezolizumab. 
Mutagenicity 
Mutagenicity studies have not been performed to establish the mutagenic potential of atezolizumab. 
However, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.  
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however assessment of the cynomolgus 
monkey male and female reproductive organs was included in the chronic toxicity study. Weekly 
administration of atezolizumab to female monkeys at an estimated AUC approximately 6 times the 
AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose caused an irregular menstrual cycle pattern and a 
lack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries which were reversible. There was no effect on the 
male reproductive organs.  
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teratogenicity  
No reproductive or teratogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with atezolizumab. Animal 
studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to immune-mediated 
rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Administration of atezolizumab could 
cause foetal harm, including embryo-foetal lethality.

Aseptic preparation, handling and storage 
Aseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  
• 
performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules 
especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  
prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the 
safe handling of intravenous agents.  
followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure 
maintenance of the aseptic conditions. 
• 
• 
Do not shake. 
Instructions for dilution 
For the recommended dose of 840 mg: fourteen mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be withdrawn 
from the vial and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or 
polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
For the recommended dose of 1 200 mg: twenty mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be withdrawn 
from the vial and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE) or 
polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
For the recommended dose of 1 680 mg: twenty-eight mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be 
withdrawn from two vials of Tecentriq 840 mg and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin 
(PO), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection. 
After dilution, the final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 3.2 and 16.8 mg/mL. 
The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Once the infusion is 
prepared it should be administered immediately (see section 6.3). 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulates and discolouration prior to 
administration. If particulates or discoloration are observed, the solution should not be used.  
No incompatibilities have been observed between Tecentriq and intravenous bags with 
product-contacting surfaces of PVC, PO, PE, or PP. In addition, no incompatibilities have been 
observed with in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone or polysulfone, and infusion sets 
and other infusion aids composed of PVC, PE, polybutadiene, or polyetherurethane. The use of in-line 
filter membranes is optional. 
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line. 
Disposal  
The release of Tecentriq in the environment should be minimised. Any unused medicinal product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tecentriq in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established. Currently available data for intravenous atezolizumab are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment of Tecentriq is required in 
patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  
Asian patients 
Due to increased haematologic toxicities observed in Asian patients in IMpower150, it is 
recommended that the starting dose of paclitaxel should be 175 mg/m2 every three weeks. 
Renal impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are 
too limited to draw conclusions on this population. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild 
or moderate hepatic impairment. Tecentriq has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2 
Patients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2 were excluded from the clinical trials in NSCLC, TNBC, 
ES-SCLC, 2nd line UC and HCC (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Method of administration 
It is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation (intravenous or 
subcutaneous) is being administered to the patient, as prescribed. 
Tecentriq solution for injection is not intended for intravenous administration and must be given by 
subcutaneous injection only. 
Prior to administration, remove Tecentriq solution for injection from refrigeration and allow the 
solution to reach room temperature. For instructions on the use and handling of Tecentriq solution for 
injection prior to administration, refer to section 6.6. 
Administer 15 mL of Tecentriq solution for injection subcutaneously in the thigh in approximately 
7 minutes. Use of a subcutaneous infusion set (e.g. winged/butterfly) is recommended. DO NOT 
administer the remaining residual hold-up volume in the tubing to the patient. 
The injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh only. New injections should be 
given at least 2.5 cm from the old site and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, or 
hard. During the treatment course with Tecentriq solution for injection other medicinal products for 
subcutaneous administration should preferably be injected at different sites. 
4.3  Contraindications 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to atezolizumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Most immune-mediated adverse reactions occurring during treatment with atezolizumab were 
reversible with interruptions of atezolizumab and initiation of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system have been observed. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions with atezolizumab may occur after the last dose of atezolizumab. 
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, thorough evaluation to confirm aetiology or 
exclude other causes should be performed. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab 
should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid 
should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical trials in patients whose 
immune-mediated adverse reactions could not be controlled with systemic corticosteroid use, 
administration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. 
Atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction 
that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that 
are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
Cases of pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab 
(see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes 
other than immune-mediated pneumonitis should be ruled out. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 1 to 2 mg/kg 
body weight (bw)/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the 
event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis. 
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
Cases of hepatitis, some leading to fatal outcomes have been observed in clinical trials with 
atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis. 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin should be monitored 
prior to initiation of treatment, periodically during treatment with atezolizumab and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation. 
For patients without HCC, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if Grade 2 event (ALT or 
AST > 3 to 5 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) persists for more than 5 to 7 days, and 1 to 
2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event improves to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and 
corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 events (ALT or AST 
> 5.0 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 3 x ULN). 
For patients with HCC, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if ALT or AST increases to 
> 3 to ≤ 10 x ULN from normal limits at baseline, or > 5 to ≤ 10 x ULN from > 1 ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN 
at baseline, or > 8 to ≤ 10 x ULN from > 3 ULN to ≤ 5 x ULN at baseline, and persists for more than 5 
to 7 days, and 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event 
improves to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and 
corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued if ALT or AST increases to > 10 x ULN or total 
bilirubin increases > 3 x ULN). 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Cases of diarrhoea or colitis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis.  
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 stools/day 
over baseline) or colitis (symptomatic). For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, if symptoms persist > 5 days 
or recur, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. For 
Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day 
methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 
1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the 
event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade 4 (life threatening; urgent intervention indicated) diarrhoea or colitis. The potential 
complication of gastrointestinal perforation associated with colitis should be taken into consideration. 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies 
Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
including diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see 
section 4.8).  
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Thyroid function 
should be monitored prior to and periodically during treatment with atezolizumab. Appropriate 
management of patients with abnormal thyroid function tests at baseline should be considered. 
Asymptomatic patients with abnormal thyroid function tests can receive atezolizumab. For 
symptomatic hypothyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and thyroid hormone replacement 
should be initiated as needed. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy and 
without corticosteroids. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and an 
anti-thyroid medicinal product should be initiated as needed. Treatment with atezolizumab may be 
resumed when symptoms are controlled and thyroid function is improving. 
For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with 
intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. 
Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should 
follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. 
Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids 
have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the patient is stable on 
replacement therapy (if required). 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For Grade 2 or Grade 3 hypophysitis, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with intravenous 
corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started, and 
hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 
1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to 
≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent 
per day and the patient is stable on replacement therapy (if required). Treatment with atezolizumab 
should be permanently discontinued for Grade 4 hypophysitis. 
Treatment with insulin should be initiated for type 1 diabetes mellitus. For ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycaemia 
(fasting glucose > 250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L), atezolizumab should be withheld. Treatment with 
atezolizumab may be resumed if metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. 
Immune-mediated meningoencephalitis 
Meningoencephalitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. 
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of meningitis or 
encephalitis. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or 
equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of 
prednisone or equivalent should follow. 
Immune-mediated neuropathies 
Myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be life threatening, 
and facial paresis were observed in patients receiving atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for 
symptoms of motor and sensory neuropathy. 
Myelitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
closely monitored for signs and symptoms that are suggestive of myelitis.  
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of myasthenic 
syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids (at a 
dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 1 or 2 facial paresis, and treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. 
Treatment may be resumed only if the event fully resolves. Treatment with atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 facial paresis, or any other neuropathy that does not 
fully resolve while withholding atezolizumab. 
Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 2, 3 or 4 myelitis.  
Immune-mediated pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, has been observed in clinical 
trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms that are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 serum amylase or lipase levels 
increased (> 2 x ULN), or Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis, and treatment with intravenous 
corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once 
symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed when serum amylase and lipase levels improve to 
≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, or symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved, and corticosteroids have been 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for Grade 4, or any grade of recurrent pancreatitis. 
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Cases of myocarditis, including fatal cases, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Myocarditis may also be a 
clinical manifestation of myositis and should be managed accordingly. 
Patients with cardiac or cardiopulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis, to 
ensure the initiation of appropriate measures at an early stage. If myocarditis is suspected, treatment 
with atezolizumab should be withheld, prompt initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 
2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started, and prompt cardiology consultation 
with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis 
of myocarditis is established, treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for 
Grade ≥ 2 myocarditis (see section 4.2). 
Immune-mediated nephritis 
Nephritis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for changes in renal function. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 nephritis, and treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. 
Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, 
and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with 
atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. 
Immune-mediated myositis 
Cases of myositis, including fatal cases, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myositis. Patients with possible myositis 
should be monitored for signs of myocarditis. 
If a patient develops signs and symptoms of myositis, close monitoring should be implemented, and 
the patient referred to a specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Treatment with 
atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 myositis and corticosteroid therapy (1 to 
2 mg/kg bw/day prednisone or equivalent) should be initiated. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, 
taper corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event 
improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg oral 
prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued 
for Grade 4 or Grade 3 recurrent myositis, or when unable to reduce the corticosteroid dose to the 
equivalent of ≤ 10 mg prednisone per day within 12 weeks after onset. 
Immune-mediated severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
Immune-mediated severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients receiving 
atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes 
should be excluded. For suspected SCARs, patients should be referred to a specialist for further 
diagnosis and management. 
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 3 skin 
reactions and treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to2 mg/kg bw/day of prednisone or 
equivalent should be started. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ 
Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin reactions, 
and corticosteroids should be administered. 
Atezolizumab should be withheld for patients with suspected SJS or TEN.  For confirmed SJS or TEN, 
atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued. 
Caution should be used when considering the use of atezolizumab in a patient who has previously 
experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immune-
stimulatory anticancer agents. 
Immune-mediated pericardial disorders 
Pericardial disorders, including pericarditis, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, some leading 
to fatal outcomes, have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of pericardial disorders. 
For suspected Grade 1 pericarditis, treatment with atezolizumab should be withheld and prompt 
cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be 
initiated. For suspected Grade ≥ 2 pericardial disorders, treatment with atezolizumab should be 
withheld, prompt treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg bw/day of 
prednisone or equivalent should be started and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup 
according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of a pericardial disorder 
event is established, treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade ≥ 2 
pericardial disorders (see section 4.2). 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including fatal cases, has been reported in patients 
receiving atezolizumab (see section 4.8). HLH should be considered when the presentation of cytokine 
release syndrome is atypical or prolonged. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of HLH. For suspected HLH, atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued and patients 
should be referred to a specialist for further diagnosis and management. 
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions 
may occur, including noninfective cystitis. 
Evaluate all suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions to exclude other causes. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions and, based on the severity 
of the reaction, managed with treatment modifications and corticosteroids as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.2 and section 4.8). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). 
The rate of injection should be reduced or paused in patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related 
reactions. Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion-
related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions may continue to receive 
atezolizumab with close monitoring; premedication with antipyretic and antihistamines may be 
considered.

Disease-specific precautions 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC 
Physicians should carefully consider the combined risks of the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin before initiating treatment (see section 4.8). 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in metastatic TNBC 
Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathies occurring during treatment with atezolizumab and nab-
paclitaxel may be reversible with interruptions of nab-paclitaxel. Physicians should consult the nab-
paclitaxel summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for specific precautions and contraindications 
of this medicine. 
Use of atezolizumab in UC for previously untreated patients who are considered cisplatin ineligible 
The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the IMvigor210 Cohort 1 study population were 
overall comparable to patients in the clinic who would be considered cisplatin ineligible but would be 
eligible for a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. There are insufficient data for the 
subgroup of patients that would be unfit for any chemotherapy; therefore, atezolizumab should be used 
with caution in these patients, after careful consideration of the potential balance of risks and benefits 
on an individual basis. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin 
Patients with NSCLC that had clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear 
cavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging, were excluded from the pivotal clinical trial 
IMpower150 after several cases of fatal pulmonary haemorrhage were observed, which is a known 
risk factor of treatment with bevacizumab. 
In the absence of data, atezolizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful 
evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients 
with NSCLC who have progressed on erlotinib+bevacizumab 
In study IMpower150, there are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients who have progressed previously on 
erlotinib+bevacizumab. 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in HCC 
Data in HCC patients with Child-Pugh B liver disease treated with atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab are very limited and there are currently no data available in HCC patients with Child-
Pugh C liver disease. 
Patients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, and cases of severe 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including fatal events, were reported in patients with HCC treated with 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. In patients with HCC, screening for and subsequent 
treatment of oesophageal varices should be performed as per clinical practice prior to starting 
treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding with the combination 
treatment. Please refer to the bevacizumab Summary of Product Characteristics. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diabetes mellitus can occur during treatment with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. 
Physicians should monitor blood glucose levels prior to and periodically during treatment with 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as clinically indicated. 
Use of atezolizumab as monotherapy for first-line treatment in metastatic NSCLC 
Physicians should consider the delayed onset of atezolizumab effect before initiating first-line 
treatment as monotherapy in patients with NSCLC. A higher number of deaths within 2.5 months after 
randomisation followed by a long-term survival benefit was observed with atezolizumab compared 
with chemotherapy. No specific factor(s) associated with early deaths could be identified (see section 
5.1). 
Patients excluded from clinical trials 
Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: a history of autoimmune 
disease, history of pneumonitis, active brain metastasis, HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (for 
non-HCC patients), significant cardiovascular disease and patients with inadequate hematologic and 
end-organ function. Patients who were administered a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to 
enrolment; systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive 
medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to study entry; therapeutic oral or intravenous antibiotics 
within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment were excluded from clinical trials. 
Patient card 
The prescriber must discuss the risks of Tecentriq therapy with the patient. The patient will be 
provided with the patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. Since 
atezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions 
are expected. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be 
avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of 
atezolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat 
immune-mediated adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after 
treatment with atezolizumab. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of atezolizumab in pregnant women. No developmental and 
reproductive studies were conducted with atezolizumab. Animal studies have demonstrated that 
inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in murine pregnancy models can lead to immune-mediated 
rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3). These results indicate a 
potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that administration of atezolizumab during pregnancy 
could cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
Human immunoglobulins G1 (IgG1) are known to cross the placental barrier and atezolizumab is an 
IgG1; therefore, atezolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing 
foetus. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atezolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with atezolizumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether atezolizumab is excreted in human milk. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal 
antibody and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue Tecentriq therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and 
the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of atezolizumab on fertility. No reproductive and 
development toxicity studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however, based on the 26-week 
repeat dose toxicity study, atezolizumab had an effect on menstrual cycles at an estimated AUC 
approximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose and was reversible (see 
section 5.3). There were no effects on the male reproductive organs. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tecentriq has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue 
should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of atezolizumab as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 4 739 patients with various 
tumour types that were administered atezolizumab intravenously and 247 patients with NSCLC that 
were administered atezolizumab subcutaneously. The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) were 
fatigue (29.9%), decreased appetite (20.0%), rash (20.0%), nausea (19.4%), diarrhoea (18.4%), 
pyrexia (18.3%), cough (18.1%), arthralgia (16.6%), dyspnoea (16.4%), pruritus (13.7%), asthenia 
(12.9%), back pain (12.5%), vomiting (11.9%), urinary tract infection (11.1%) and headache (10.5%). 
The safety of intravenous atezolizumab given in combination with other medicinal products, has been 
evaluated in 4 535 patients across multiple tumour types. The most common adverse reactions 
(≥ 20%) were anaemia (36.8%), neutropenia (36.6%), nausea (35.5%), fatigue (33.1%), alopecia 
(28.1%), rash (27.8%), diarrhoea (27.6%), thrombocytopenia (27.1%), constipation (25.8%), 
decreased appetite (24.7%) and peripheral neuropathy (24.4%). 
The safety profile of Tecentriq solution for injection was overall similar to the known safety profile of 
the intravenous formulation, with an additional adverse reaction of injection site reaction (4.5% in the 
subcutaneous Tecentriq arm vs 0% in the intravenous atezolizumab arm). 
Use of atezolizumab in the adjuvant NSCLC setting  
The safety profile of atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patient population (IMpower010) was generally consistent with the overall pooled monotherapy safety 
profile in the advanced setting. Nevertheless, the incidence of immune-mediated adverse reactions of 
atezolizumab in IMpower010 was 51.7% compared to 38.4% in the pooled monotherapy population 
with advanced disease. No new immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified in the adjuvant 
setting. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  
In the first-line NSCLC study (IMpower150), an overall higher frequency of adverse events was 
observed in the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin 
compared to atezolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, including Grade 3 and 4 events (63.6% 
compared to 57.5%), Grade 5 events (6.1% compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to 
atezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as well as adverse events leading to withdrawal of any 
study treatment (33.8% compared to 13.3%). Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal 
inflammation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, hypertension and proteinuria were reported 
higher (≥5% difference) in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, 
paclitaxel and carboplatin. Other clinically significant adverse events which were observed more 
frequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were epistaxis, 
haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events. 
Further details on serious adverse reactions are provided in section 4.4. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions (ARs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories of 
frequency in Table 3 for atezolizumab (intravenous and subcutaneous) given as monotherapy or as 
combination therapy. Adverse reactions known to occur with atezolizumab or chemotherapies given 
alone may occur during treatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these 
reactions were not reported in clinical trials with combination therapy. The following categories of 
frequency have been used: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 
to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order 
of decreasing seriousness.

Immunogenicity 
Subcutaneous formulation 
In IMscin001, the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-atezolizumab antibodies in patients treated 
with subcutaneous and intravenous Tecentriq was comparable (19.5% [43/221] and 13.9% [15/108], 
respectively),following a median of 2.8 months of treatment. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in patients treated with subcutaneous Tecentriq was 5.4% (12/224). The 
clinical relevance of the development of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies after treatment with Tecentriq 
solution for injection is unknown. 
Intravenous formulation 
Across multiple phase II and III studies, 13.1% to 54.1% of patients developed treatment-emergent 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Patients who developed treatment-emergent ADAs tended to have 
overall poorer health and disease characteristics at baseline. Those imbalances in health and disease 
characteristics at baseline can confound the interpretation of PK, efficacy and safety analyses. 
Exploratory analyses adjusting for imbalances in baseline health and disease characteristics were 
conducted to assess the effect of ADA on efficacy. These analyses did not exclude possible attenuation 
of efficacy benefit in patients who developed ADA compared to patients who did not develop ADA. 
The median time to ADA onset ranged from 3 weeks to 5 weeks. 
Across pooled datasets for patients treated with atezolizumab monotherapy (N=3 460) and with 
combination therapies (N= 2 285), the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for 
the ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: Grade 3-4 AEs 
46.2% vs. 39.4%, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 39.6% vs. 33.3%, AEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal 8.5% vs 7.8% (for monotherapy); Grade 3-4 AEs 63.9% vs. 60.9%, SAEs 43.9% vs. 
35.6%, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 22.8% vs 18.4% (for combination therapy). However, 
available data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse reactions. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of atezolizumab in children and adolescents has not been established. No new safety signals 
were observed in a clinical trial with 69 paediatric patients (< 18 years) and the safety profile was 
comparable to adults. 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger 
patients receiving atezolizumab (intravenous or subcutaneous) monotherapy. In study IMpower150, 
age ≥ 65 was associated with an increased risk of developing adverse events in patients receiving 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
In studies IMpower150, IMpower133, IMpower110 and IMscin001 data for patients ≥ 75 years of age 
are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no information on overdose with atezolizumab. 
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01FF05 
Tecentriq solution for injection contains the active substance atezolizumab which provides the 
therapeutic effect of this medicinal product and recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an 
enzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-formulated substances when administered 
subcutaneously. 
Mechanism of action 
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) may be expressed on tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating 
immune cells, and can contribute to the inhibition of the antitumour immune response in the tumour 
microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T-cells and antigen 
presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.  
Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that 
directly binds to PD-L1 and provides a dual blockade of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors, releasing 
PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including reactivating the antitumour 
immune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Atezolizumab spares the 
PD-L2/PD-1 interaction allowing PD-L2/PD-1 mediated inhibitory signals to persist.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Urothelial carcinoma 
Intravenous formulation 
IMvigor211 (GO29294): Randomised trial in locally advanced or metastatic UC patients previously 
treated with chemotherapy 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, (IMvigor211), was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice 
of vinflunine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who 
progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. This study excluded patients who had 
a history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases; administration 
of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; and administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within 
2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks, 
and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression 
on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression 
subgroups for the analyses described below.  
A total of 931 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either atezolizumab or 
chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), PD-L1 
expression status on IC (< 5% vs. ≥ 5%), number of prognostic risk factors (0 vs. 1-3), and liver 
metastases (yes vs. no). Prognostic risk factors included time from prior chemotherapy of < 3 months, 
ECOG performance status > 0 and haemoglobin < 10 g/dL. 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
No dose reduction of atezolizumab was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as 
assessed by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Vinflunine was administered 320 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Paclitaxel was administered 175 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 3 hours on day 1 of each 3-week 
cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 2.8 months for the atezolizumab arm, 
2.1 months for the vinflunine and paclitaxel arms and 1.6 months for the docetaxel arm. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well 
balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years (range: 31 to 88), and 77.1% of 
patients were male. The majority of patients were white (72.1%), 53.9% of patients within the 
chemotherapy arm received vinflunine, 71.4% of patients had at least one poor prognostic risk factor 
and 28.8% had liver metastases at baseline. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (45.6%) or 1 
(54.4%). Bladder was the primary tumour site for 71.1% of patients and 25.4% of patients had upper 
tract UC. There were 24.2% of patients who received only prior platinum-containing adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant therapy and progressed within 12 months. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for IMvigor211 is overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints 
evaluated per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 are 
objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). 
Comparisons with respect to OS between the treatment arm and control arm within the IC2/3, IC1/2/3, 
and ITT (Intention-to-treat, i.e. all comers) populations were tested using a hierarchical fixed-sequence 
procedure based on a stratified log-rank test at two-sided level of 5% as follows: step 1) IC2/3 
population; step 2) IC1/2/3 population; step 3) all comers population. OS results for each of steps 2 
and 3 could be formally tested for statistical significance only if the result in the preceding step was 
statistically significant. 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median survival follow-up is 17 months. The primary analysis of study IMvigor211 did not meet 
its primary endpoint of OS. Atezolizumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival 
benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic 
UC. Per the pre-specified hierarchical testing order, the IC2/3 population was tested first, with an OS 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.21; median OS of 11.1 vs. 10.6 months for atezolizumab 
and chemotherapy respectively). The stratified log-rank p-value was 0.41 and therefore the results are 
considered not statistically significant in this population. As a consequence, no formal tests of 
statistical significance could be performed for OS in the IC1/2/3 or all comer populations, and results 
of those analyses would be considered exploratory. The key results in the all comer population are 
summarised in Table 4. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the all comer population is presented in 
Figure 1. 
An exploratory updated survival analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow up 
of 34 months in the ITT population. The median OS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.8, 9.6) in the 
atezolizumab arm and 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.2, 8.6) in the chemotherapy arm with a hazard ratio of 
0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). Consistent with the trend observed at primary analysis for 12-month OS 
rates, numerically higher 24-month and 30-month OS rates were observed for patients in the 
atezolizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy arm in the ITT population. The percentage of 
patients alive at 24 months (KM estimate) was 12.7% in the chemotherapy arm and 22.5% in the 
atezolizumab arm; and at 30 months (KM estimate) was 9.8% in the chemotherapy arm and 18.1% in 
the atezolizumab arm.

IMvigor210 (GO29293): Single-arm trial in previously untreated urothelial carcinoma patients who 
are ineligible for cisplatin therapy and in urothelial carcinoma patients previously treated with 
chemotherapy 
A phase II, multi-centre, international, two-cohort, single-arm clinical trial, IMvigor210, was 
conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC (also known as urothelial bladder 
cancer).  
The study enrolled a total of 438 patients and had two patient cohorts. Cohort 1 included previously 
untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were ineligible or unfit for 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy or had disease progression at least 12 months after treatment with a 
platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Cohort 2 included patients who 
received at least one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic UC or 
had disease progression within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. 
In Cohort 1, 119 patients were treated with atezolizumab 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 
3 weeks until disease progression. The median age was 73 years. Most patients were male (81%), and 
the majority of patients were White (91%).  
Cohort 1 included 45 patients (38%) with ECOG performance status of 0, 50 patients (42%) with 
ECOG performance status of 1 and 24 patients (20%) with ECOG performance status of 2, 35 patients 
(29%) with no Bajorin risk factors (ECOG performance status ≥ 2 and visceral metastasis), 66 patients 
(56%) with one Bajorin risk factor and 18 patients (15 %) with two Bajorin risk factors, 84 patients 
(71%) with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min), and 25 patients 
(21%) with liver metastasis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort 1 was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as assessed 
by an independent review facility (IRF) using RECIST v1.1.  
The primary analysis was performed when all patients had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. Median 
duration of treatment was 15.0 weeks and median duration of survival follow-up was 8.5 months in all 
comers. Clinically relevant IRF-assessed ORRs per RECIST v1.1 were shown; however, when 
compared to a pre-specified historical control response rate of 10%, statistical significance was not 
reached for the primary endpoint. The confirmed ORRs per IRF-RECIST v1.1 were 21.9% (95% CI: 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.3, 40.0) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 18.8% (95% CI: 10.9, 29.0) in patients with PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%, and 19.3% (95% CI: 12.7, 27.6) in all comers. The median duration of response 
(DOR) was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all comers. OS was not mature with 
an event patient ratio of approximately 40%. Median OS for all patient subgroups (PD-L1 expression 
≥ 5 % and ≥ 1 %) and in all comers was 10.6 months.  
An updated analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow-up of 17.2 months for 
Cohort 1 and is summarised in Table 5. The median DOR was not reached in any PD-L1 expression 
subgroup or in all comers.

In Cohort 2, the co-primary efficacy endpoints were confirmed ORR as assessed by an IRF using 
RECIST v1.1 and investigator-assessed ORR according to Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria. 
There were 310 patients treated with atezolizumab 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks 
until loss of clinical benefit. The primary analysis of Cohort 2 was performed when all patients had at 
least 24 weeks of follow-up. The study met its co-primary endpoints in Cohort 2, demonstrating 
statistically significant ORRs per IRF-assessed RECIST v1.1 and investigator-assessed mRECIST 
compared to a pre-specified historical control response rate of 10%. 
An analysis was also performed with a median duration of survival follow-up of 21.1 months for 
Cohort 2. The confirmed ORRs per IRF-RECIST v1.1 were 28.0% (95% CI: 19.5, 37.9) in patients 
with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 19.3% (95% CI: 14.2, 25.4) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, 
and 15.8% (95% CI: 11.9, 20.4) in all comers. The confirmed ORR per investigator-assessed 
mRECIST was 29.0% (95% CI: 20.4, 38.9) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 23.7% (95% CI:

18.1, 30.1) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and 19.7% (95% CI: 15.4, 24.6) in all comers. 
The rate of complete response per IRF-RECIST v1.1 in the all comer population was 6.1% (95% CI: 
3.7, 9.4). For Cohort 2, median DOR was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all 
comers, however was reached in patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% (13.3 months; 95% CI 4.2, 
NE). The OS rate at 12 months was 37% in all comers.  
IMvigor130 (WO30070): Phase III study of atezolizumab monotherapy and in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma 
A phase III, multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, partially blinded (Arms A and C only) 
study, IMvigor130, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab + platinum-
based combination chemotherapy (i.e., either cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine), Arm A, or 
atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm B, open-label arm) versus placebo + platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy (Arm C) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who had not received prior 
systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The co-primary efficacy outcomes were investigator-
assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in Arm A versus Arm C and overall survival (OS) in Arm A 
versus C and then Arm B versus C, analyzed in a hierarchical fashion. Overall survival was not 
statistically significant for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C, and thus no further formal testing 
could be conducted per the pre-defined hierarchical testing order. 
Based on an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) recommendation following an early 
review of survival data, accrual of patients on the atezolizumab monotherapy treatment arm whose 
tumours had a low PD-L1 expression (less than 5% of immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry using VENTANA PD-L1 [SP142] assay) was stopped after observing 
decreased overall survival for this subgroup at an unplanned early analysis, however, this occurred 
after the vast majority of patients had already been enrolled. 
Out of 719 patients enrolled in the atezolizumab monotherapy (n=360) and chemotherapy alone 
(n=359) arms, 50 and 43 patients, respectively, were cisplatin-ineligible by Galsky criteria and had 
tumours with high PD-L1 expression (≥ 5% of immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry using VENTANA PD-L1 [SP142] assay). In an exploratory analysis in this 
subgroup of patients, the unstratified HR for OS was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.91). The median OS was 
18.6 months (95% CI: 14.0, 49.4) in the atezolizumab monotherapy arm vs. 10.0 months (95% CI: 7.4, 
18.1) in the chemotherapy alone arm (see Figure 2).

Non-small cell lung cancer 
Adjuvant treatment of early-stage NSCLC 
Intravenous formulation 
IMpower010 (GO29527): Randomised phase III trial in patients with resected NSCLC after cisplatin-
based chemotherapy 
A phase III, open label, multi-centre, randomised study, GO29527 (IMpower010), was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IB 
(tumours ≥ 4 cm) – IIIA NSCLC (per the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint 
Committee on Cancer staging system, 7th edition).  
The following selection criteria define patients with high risk of recurrence who are included in the 
therapeutic indication and are reflective of the patient population with stage II – IIIA according to the 
7th edition staging system: 
Tumour size ≥ 5 cm; or tumours of any size that are either accompanied by N1 or N2 status; or 
tumours that are invasive of thoracic structures (directly invade the parietal pleura, chest wall, 
diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, 
trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina); or tumours that involve the 
main bronchus < 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement of the carina; or tumours that are 
associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung; or tumours with separate 
nodule(s) in the same lobe or different ipsilateral lobe as the primary. 
The study did not include patients who had N2 status with tumours invading the mediastinum, heart, 
great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina, or with separate 
tumour nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe. 
A total of 1 280 enrolled patients had complete tumour resection and were eligible to receive up to 4 
cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are described in 
Table 6. 
Table 6: Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (IMpower010) 
Adjuvant cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy:  
Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenous on 
Day 1 of each 21 day cycle with one 
of the following treatment regimens 
Vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 intravenous, Days 1 and 8 
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenous, Day 1 
Gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 intravenous, Days 1 and 8 
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenous, Day 1(non-squamous) 
After completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (up to four cycles), a total of 1 005 patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab (Arm A) or best supportive care (BSC) (Arm B). 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by IV infusion every 3 weeks for 16 
cycles unless there was disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by 
sex, stage of disease, histology, and PD-L1 expression.  
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, 
attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation; administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 
2 weeks prior to randomisation. Tumour assessments were conducted at baseline of the randomisation 
phase and every 4 months for the first year following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 6 months until 
year five, then annually thereafter.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in the ITT population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 62 years (range: 26 to 84), and 67% of patients were 
male. The majority of patients were White (73%), and 24% were Asian. Most patients were current or 
previous smokers (78%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (55%) or 1 (44%). 
Overall, 12% of patients had stage IB, 47% had stage II and 41% had stage IIIA disease. The 
percentage of patients who had tumours with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and ≥ 50% on TC as measured 
by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay was 55% and 26%, respectively.  
The primary efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by the 
investigator. DFS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of occurrence of 
any of the following: first documented recurrence of disease, new primary NSCLC, or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurred first. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate DFS in the PD-L1 
≥ 1% TC stage II  – IIIA patient population. Key secondary efficacy objectives were to evaluate DFS 
in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – IIIA patient population and overall survival (OS) in the ITT 
population. 
At the time of the interim DFS analysis, the study met its primary endpoint. The median follow-up 
time was approximately 32 months. In the analysis of patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II  – IIIA 
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n = 209), a clinically meaningful improvement in 
DFS in the atezolizumab arm was observed compared to the BSC arm (Table 7). The OS data were 
immature at the time of the DFS interim analysis with approximately 16.3 % of deaths overall reported 
in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – IIIA patient population, without EGFR mutations and ALK 
rearrangements. An exploratory analysis of OS suggested a trend in favor of atezolizumab over BSC, 
with a stratified HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.82) in this patient population. 
The key efficacy results for the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II  – IIIA patient population, without EGFR 
mutations and ALK rearrangements, are summarised in Table 7. The Kaplan-Meier curve for DFS is 
presented in Figure 3.

The observed DFS improvement in the atezolizumab arm compared with the BSC arm was 
consistently shown across the majority of pre-specified subgroups in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II – 
IIIA patient population without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, including both non-
squamous NSCLC patients (unstratified HR of 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.69; median DFS NE vs. 35.7 
months) and squamous NSCLC patients (unstratified HR of 0.60, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.26; median DFS 
36.7 vs. NE months).  
First-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC 
Intravenous formulation 
IMpower150 (GO29436): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC, in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, IMpower150, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with 
or without bevacizumab, in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.  
Patients were excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live, attenuated 
vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents 
within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to 
randomisation, active or untreated CNS metastases, clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great 
vessels or clear cavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks 
thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression 
subgroups for the analyses described below.  
A total of 1 202 patients were enrolled and were randomised (1:1:1) to receive one of the treatment 
regimens described in Table 8. Randomisation was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases and 
PD-L1 tumour expression on TC and IC.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 63 years (range: 31 to 90), and 60% of patients were 
male. The majority of patients were white (82%). Approximately 10% of patients had known EGFR 
mutation, 4% had known ALK rearrangements, 14% had liver metastasis at baseline, and most 
patients were current or previous smokers (80%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%) or 
1 (57%). 51% of patients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% TC or ≥ 1% IC and 49% of 
patients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of < 1% TC and < 1% IC. 
At the time of the final analysis for PFS, patients had a median follow up time of 15.3 months. The 
ITT population, including patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements who should have 
been previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, demonstrated clinically meaningful PFS 
improvement in Arm B as compared to Arm C (HR of 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.72; median PFS 8.3 vs. 
6.8 months).   
At the time of the interim OS analysis, patients had a median follow-up of 19.7 months. The key 
results from this analysis as well as from the updated PFS analysis in the ITT population are 
summarised in Tables 9 and 10. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the ITT population is presented in 
Figure 4. Figure 5 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups. Updated PFS results 
are also presented in Figures 6 and 7.

In Arm B as compared to Arm C, pre-specified subgroup analyses from the interim OS analysis 
showed an OS improvement for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (hazard ratio 
[HR] of 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.03; median OS not reached vs. 17.5 months), and liver metastases (HR 
of 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.82; median OS 13.3 vs. 9.4 months). PFS improvements were also shown in 
patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (HR of 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.87; median PFS 
10.0 vs. 6.1 months) and liver metastases (HR of 0.41, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.62; median PFS 8.2 vs. 5.4 
months). OS results were similar for patients aged < 65 and ≥ 65 subgroups, respectively. Data for 
patients ≥ 75 years of age are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. For all subgroup 
analyses, formal statistical testing was not planned.  
IMpower130 (GO29537): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin 
A phase III, open-label, randomised study, GO29537 (IMpower130), was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, in 
chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with EGFR mutations or 
ALK rearrangements should have been previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Patients were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. 
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease, administration of live, attenuated 
vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of immunostimulatory agents within 
4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to randomisation, 
and active or untreated CNS metastases. Patients who had prior treatment with CD137 agonists or 
immune checkpoint blockade therapies (anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies) were not 
eligible. However, patients who had prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment could be enrolled, as long as the last 
dose was received at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation, and there was no history of severe immune-
mediated adverse events from anti-CTLA-4 (NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4). Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, then every 9 weeks thereafter. 
Tumour specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour infiltrating 
immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression subgroups for the analyses 
described below. 
Patients, including those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, were enrolled and were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the treatment regimens described in Table 11. 
Randomisation was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases and PD-L1 expression on TC and 
IC. Patients receiving treatment regimen B were able to crossover and receive atezolizumab 
monotherapy following disease progression.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population defined as ITT-WT 
(n=679) were well balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 18 to 
86 years). The majority of the patients were male (59%) and white (90%). Fourteen point seven 
percent of patients had liver metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous 
smokers (90%). The majority of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 1 (59%) and PD-
L1 expression < 1% (approximately 52%). Among 107 Arm B patients who had a response status of 
stable disease, partial response, or complete response after induction therapy, 40 received pemetrexed 
switch maintenance therapy.  
The primary analysis was conducted in all patients, excluding those with EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements, defined as ITT-WT population (n=679). Patients had a median survival follow up 
time of 18.6 months and showed improved OS and PFS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and 
carboplatin as compared to the control. The key results are summarised in Table 12 and Kaplan-Meier 
curves for OS and PFS are presented in Figures 8 and 10, respectively. The exploratory results of OS 
and PFS by PD-L1 expression are summarised in Figures 9 and 11, respectively. Patients with liver 
metastases did not show improved PFS or OS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, 
compared to nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin (HR of 0.93, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.47 for PFS and HR of 1.04, 
95% CI: 0.63, 1.72 for OS, respectively). 
Fifty-nine percent of patients in the nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin arm received any cancer 
immunotherapy after disease progression, which includes atezolizumab as crossover treatment (41% 
of all patients), compared to 7.3% of patients in the atezolizumab, nab paclitaxel and carboplatin arm. 
In an exploratory analysis with longer follow up (median: 24.1 months), the median OS for both arms 
was unchanged relative to the primary analysis, with HR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01).

IMpower110 (GO29431): Randomised phase III trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
NSCLC  
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, randomised study, IMpower110, was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic NSCLC. Patients 
had PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC (PD-L1 stained ≥ 1% of tumour cells) or ≥ 1% IC (PD-L1 stained 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells covering ≥ 1% of the tumour area) based on the VENTANA PD-L1 
(SP142) Assay. 
A total of 572 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab (Arm A) or 
chemotherapy (Arm B). Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator or unacceptable 
toxicity. The chemotherapy regimens are described in Table 13. Randomisation was stratified by sex, 
ECOG performance status, histology, and PD-L1 tumour expression on TC and IC.

unacceptable toxicity 
c Gemcitabine is administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle 
d No crossover was allowed from the control arm (platinum-based chemotherapy) to the atezolizumab 
arm (Arm A)  
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, 
attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of systemic 
immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 
2 weeks prior to randomisation, active or untreated CNS metastases. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks 
thereafter. 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC or 
≥ 1% IC who do not have EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=554) were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 64.5 years (range: 30 to 87), and 70% of patients 
were male. The majority of patients were white (84%) and Asian (14%). Most patients were current or 
previous smokers (87%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (36%) or 1 (64%). 
Overall, 69% of patients had non-squamous disease and 31% of patients had squamous disease. The 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics in patients with high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 
≥ 50% TC or ≥ 10% IC) who do not have with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=205) were 
generally representative of the broader study population and were balanced between the treatment 
arms. 
The primary endpoint was OS. At the time of the interim OS analysis, patients with high PD-L1 
expression excluding those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n=205) showed 
statistically significant improvement in OS for the patients randomised to atezolizumab (Arm A) as 
compared with chemotherapy (Arm B) (HR of 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; median OS of 20.2 months vs 
13.1 months) with a two-sided p-value of 0.0106. The median survival follow-up time in patients with 
high PD-L1 expression was 15.7 months.  
In an exploratory OS analysis with longer follow up (median: 31.3 months) for these patients, the 
median OS for the atezolizumab arm was unchanged relative to the primary OS interim analysis 
(20.2 months) and was 14.7 months for the chemotherapy arm (HR of 0.76, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.09). The 
key results at the exploratory analysis are summarised in Table 14. The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS 
and PFS in patients with high PD-L1 expression are presented in Figures 12 and 13. A higher 
proportion of patients experienced death within the first 2.5 months in the atezolizumab arm (16/107, 
15.0%) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (10/98, 10.2%). No specific factor(s) associated with 
early deaths could be identified.

Second-line treatment of NSCLC 
Subcutaneous formulation 
IMscin001 (BP40657): Randomised phase Ib/III trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
patients previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy 
A phase Ib/III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, BP40657 (IMscin001), was 
conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Tecentriq compared 
with intravenous atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not 
been exposed to cancer immunotherapy (CIT) and for whom prior platinum-based therapy has failed. 
IMscin001 was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the atezolizumab cycle 1 (pre-dose Cycle 2) 
serum Ctrough and model-predicted AUC from 0 to 21 days at cycle 1 of subcutaneous atezolizumab 
compared with intravenous atezolizumab (co-primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included 
efficacy [PFS, ORR, OS, DOR], and safety. 
In Part 2 (Phase III), a total of 371 patients were enrolled and randomised 2:1 to receive either 
1 875 mg of subcutaneous Tecentriq Q3W or 1 200 mg of intravenous atezolizumab Q3W. No dose 
reduction was allowed. 
Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent 
brain metastases, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation; 
administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive 
medications within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. 
The median age was 64 years (range: 27 to 85), and 69% of patients were male. The majority of 
patients were white (67%). Approximately two-third of patients (65%) had non-squamous disease, 5% 
had known EGFR mutation, 2% had known ALK rearrangements, 40% were PD-L1 positive (TC≥1% 
and/or IC≥1%), 16% had non-active CNS metastases at baseline, 26% had an ECOG PS of 0, 74% had 
an ECOG PS of 1, and most patients were current or previous smokers (70%). 80% received one prior 
therapeutic regimen.  
At the time of primary analysis, the median survival follow-up was 4.7 months and OS results were 
immature. There were 86 (35%) deaths in the subcutaneous Tecentriq arm and 37 (30%) deaths in the 
intravenous atezolizumab arm. A post hoc updated analysis was performed 9 months after the primary 
analysis with a median survival duration of follow-up of 9.5 months. The efficacy results of the 
updated analyses are summarized in Table 15 below.

OAK (GO28915): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients 
previously treated with chemotherapy 
A phase III, open-label, multi-centre, international, randomised study, OAK, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. 
This study excluded patients who had a history of autoimmune disease, active or 
corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days 
prior to enrolment, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic 
immunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were 
conducted every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were 
evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour-infiltrating immune 
cells (IC). 
A total of 1 225 patients were enrolled and per the analysis plan the first 850 randomised patients were 
included in the primary efficacy analysis. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression status on 
IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and by histology. Patients were randomised (1:1) 
to receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel. 
Atezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1 200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
No dose reduction was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the 
investigator. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week 
cycle until disease progression. For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 
2.1 months for the docetaxel arm and 3.4 months for the atezolizumab arm.  
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well 
balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 33 to 85), and 61% of 
patients were male. The majority of patients were white (70%). Approximately three-quarters of 
patients had non-squamous histology (74%), 10% had known EGFR mutation, 0.2% had known ALK 
rearrangements, 10% had CNS metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous 
smokers (82%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (37%) or 1 (63%). Seventy-five percent of 
patients received only one prior platinum-based therapeutic regimen. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The key results of this study with a median survival follow-up 
of 21 months are summarised in Table 16. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in the ITT population are 
presented in Figure 14. Figure 15 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups, 
demonstrating OS benefit with atezolizumab in all subgroups, including those with PD-L1 
expression < 1% in TC and IC.

An improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel in both non-squamous 
NSCLC patients (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89; median OS of 15.6 vs. 11.2 months 
for atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively) and squamous NSCLC patients (HR of 0.73, 
95% CI: 0.54, 0.98; median OS of 8.9 vs. 7.7 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively). 
The observed OS improvement was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients including 
those with brain metastases at baseline (HR of 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.94; median OS of 20.1 
vs. 11.9 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel respectively) and patients who were never smokers 
(HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.08; median OS of 16.3 vs. 12.6 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, 
respectively). However, patients with EGFR mutations did not show improved OS with atezolizumab

compared to docetaxel (HR of 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71, 2.18; median OS of 10.5 vs. 16.2 months for 
atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively).  
Prolonged time to deterioration of patient-reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC 
QLQ-LC13 was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel (HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; 
median not reached in either arm). The time to deterioration in other lung cancer symptoms (i.e. 
cough, dyspnoea, and arm/shoulder pain) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was similar 
between atezolizumab and docetaxel. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the open-
label design of the study. 
POPLAR (GO28753): Randomised phase II trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients 
previously treated with chemotherapy 
A phase II, multi-centre, international, randomised, open-label, controlled study, POPLAR, was 
conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following 
a platinum-containing regimen, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The primary efficacy outcome was 
overall survival. A total of 287 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab (1 200 mg 
by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression). Randomisation was 
stratified by PD-L1 expression status on IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens and by 
histology. An updated analysis with a total of 200 deaths observed and a median survival follow-up of 
22 months showed a median OS of 12.6 months in patients treated with atezolizumab, vs. 9.7 months 
in patients treated with docetaxel (HR of 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92). ORR was 15.3% vs. 14.7% and 
median DOR was 18.6 months vs. 7.2 months for atezolizumab vs. docetaxel, respectively.

IMpower133 (GO30081): Randomised phase I/III trial in patients with chemotherapy-naïve extensive-
stage SCLC, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide 
A Phase I/III, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, IMpower133, was 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and 
etoposide in patients with chemotherapy-naïve ES-SCLC. 
Patients were excluded if they had active or untreated CNS metastases; history of autoimmune disease; 
administration of live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation; administration of 
systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 1 week prior to randomisation. Tumour 
assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then 
every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients who met established criteria and who agreed to be treated beyond 
disease progression had tumour assessments conducted every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation. 
A total of 403 patients were enrolled and randomised (1:1) to receive one of the treatment regimens 
described in Table 17. Randomisation was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, and presence 
of brain metastases.

The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 26 to 90 years) with 10% of patients 
≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (65%), white (80%), and 9% had brain 
metastases and most patients were current or previous smokers (97%). Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). 
At the time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 13.9 months. A 
statistically significant improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin and etoposide compared to the control arm (HR of 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.91; median OS of 
12.3 months vs. 10.3 months). In the exploratory OS final analysis with longer follow up (median: 
22.9 months), the median OS for both arms was unchanged relative to the primary OS interim 
analysis. The PFS, ORR and DOR results from the primary analysis as well as the exploratory OS 
final analysis results are summarised in Table 18. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS are presented 
in Figures 16 and 17. Data for patients with brain metastases are too limited to draw conclusions on 
this population.

Triple-negative breast cancer 
Intravenous formulation 
IMpassion130 (WO29522): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC 
patients previously untreated for metastatic disease  
A phase III, double-blind, two-arm, multi-centre, international, randomised, placebo-controlled study, 
IMpassion130, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who had not 
received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients had to be eligible for taxane monotherapy 
(i.e. absence of rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or need for rapid 
symptom and/or disease control) and were excluded if they had received prior chemotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting within the last 12 months, a history of autoimmune disease; 
administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation, administration of 
systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal 
products within 2 weeks prior to randomisation; untreated, symptomatic or corticosteroid-dependent 
brain metastases. Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 
12 months after Cycle 1, day 1 and every 12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter. 
A total of 902 patients were enrolled and stratified by presence of liver metastases, prior taxane 
treatment, and by PD-L1 expression status in tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) (PD-L1 stained 
tumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC] < 1% of tumour area vs. ≥ 1% of the tumour area) assessed by 
the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay. 
Patients were randomised to receive atezolizumab 840 mg or placebo by intravenous infusions on 
days 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle, plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) administered via intravenous 
infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients received treatment until radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1, or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with atezolizumab could be 
continued when nab-paclitaxel was stopped due to unacceptable toxicity. The median number of 
treatment cycles was 7 for atezolizumab and 6 for nab-paclitaxel in each treatment arm. 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. Most patients were women (99.6%), 67.5% were white and 17.8% Asian. 
The median age was 55 years (range: 20-86). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (58.4%) 
or 1 (41.3%). Overall, 41% of enrolled patients had PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, 27% had liver metastases 
and 7% asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline. Approximately half the patients had received a 
taxane (51%) or anthracycline (54%) in the (neo)adjuvant setting. Patient demographics and baseline 
tumour disease in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% were generally representative of the broader 
study population. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in 
the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% per RECIST v1.1 as well as overall 
survival (OS) in the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1.  
PFS, ORR and DOR results of IMpassion130 for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% at the time of 
the final analysis for PFS with a median survival follow up of 13 months are summarised in Table 19 
with Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS in Figure 18. Patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% did not show 
improved PFS when atezolizumab was added to nab-paclitaxel (HR of 0.94, 95% CI 0.78, 1.13). 
The final OS analysis was performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% with a median follow up 
of 19.12 months. OS results are presented in Table 19 and Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 19. Patients 
with PD-L1 expression < 1% did not show improved OS when atezolizumab was added to nab-
paclitaxel (HR of 1.02, 95% CI 0.84, 1.24).  
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, exploring 
prior (neo)adjuvant treatment, BRCA1/2 mutation and asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline.  
In patients who had received prior (neo) adjuvant treatment (n = 242), the hazard ratio for primary 
(final) PFS was 0.79 and 0.77 for final OS while in patients who had not received prior (neo)adjuvant 
treatment (n = 127), the hazard ratio for primary (final) PFS was 0.44 and 0.54 for final OS.  
In the IMpassion130 study, of the 614 patients tested, 89 (15%) carried pathogenic BRCA1/2 
mutations. From the PD-L1+/BRCA1/2 mutant subgroup, 19 patients received atezolizumab plus nab-
paclitaxel and 26 placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Based on exploratory analysis and acknowledging the 
small sample size, the presence of BRCA1/2 mutation does not seem to impact the PFS clinical benefit 
of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. 
There was no evidence of efficacy in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline, 
although the number of patients treated was small; the median PFS was 2.2 months in the 
atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel arm (n = 15) compared to 5.6 months in the placebo plus nab-
paclitaxel arm (n = 11) (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.57, 3.44).

Hepatocellular carcinoma 
Intravenous formulation 
IMbrave150 (YO40245): Randomised phase III trial in patients with unresectable HCC who have not 
received prior systemic therapy, in combination with bevacizumab  
A phase III, randomised, multi-centre, international, open-label study, IMbrave150, was conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC, who have not received prior systemic 
treatment. A total of 501 patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either atezolizumab (1 200 mg) and 
15 mg/kg bw of bevacizumab every 3 weeks administered by intravenous infusion, or sorafenib 
400 mg orally twice per day. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region, macrovascular 
invasion and/or extrahepatic spread, baseline α-fetoprotein (AFP) and ECOG performance status. 
Patients in both arms received treatment until loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients 
could discontinue either atezolizumab or bevacizumab (e.g., due to adverse events) and continue on 
single-agent therapy until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity associated with the single-
agent. 
The study enrolled adults whose disease was not amenable to or progressed after surgical and/or 
locoregional therapies, were Child-Pugh A, ECOG 0/1, and who had not received prior systemic 
treatment. Bleeding (including fatal events) is a known adverse reaction with bevacizumab and upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding is a common and life threatening complication in patients with HCC. Hence, 
patients were required to be evaluated for the presence of varices within 6 months prior to treatment, 
and were excluded if they had variceal bleeding within 6 months prior to treatment, untreated or 
incompletely treated varices with bleeding or high risk of bleeding. For patients with active hepatitis 
B, HBV DNA < 500 IU/mL was required within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, and 
standard anti-HBV treatment for a minimum of 14 days prior to study entry and for the length of 
study. 
Patients were also excluded if they had moderate or severe ascites; history of hepatic encephalopathy; 
known fibrolamellar HCC; sarcomatoid HCC, mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC; active co-
infection of HBV and HCV; history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, attenuated 
vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents 
within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to 
randomisation; untreated or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases. Tumour assessments were 
performed every 6 weeks for the first 54 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1, then every 9 weeks 
thereafter.   
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced 
between the treatment arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 88 years) and 83% were male. 
The majority of patients were Asian (57%) and white (35%). 40% were from Asia (excluding Japan), 
while 60% were from rest of world. Approximately 75% of patients presented with macrovascular 
invasion and/or extrahepatic spread and 37% had a baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. Baseline ECOG 
performance status was 0 (62%) or 1 (38%). The primary risk factors for the development of HCC 
were Hepatitis B virus infection in 48% of patients, Hepatitis C virus infection in 22% of patients, and 
non-viral disease in 31% of patients. HCC was categorized as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage C in 82% of patients, stage B in 16% of patients, and stage A in 3% of patients. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were OS and IRF-assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. At the 
time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 8.6 months. The data 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS as assessed by IRF per RECIST 
v1.1 with atezolizumab + bevacizumab compared to sorafenib. A statistically significant improvement 
was also observed in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by IRF per RECIST v1.1 and HCC 
modified RECIST (mRECIST). The key efficacy results from the primary analysis are summarized in 
Table 20.  
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A descriptive updated efficacy analysis was performed with a median survival follow up time of 
15.6 months. The median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI: 17.0, 23.7) in the atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab arm versus 13.4 months (95% CI: 11.4, 16.9) in the sorafenib arm with a HR of 0.66 
(95% CI: 0.52, 0.85). The median PFS by IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 was 6.9 months (95% CI:

Efficacy in elderly 
No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger 
patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with a 
diminished effect of atezolizumab in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel.  
In studies IMpower150, IMpower133, Impower110 and IMscin001 data for patients ≥ 75 years of age 
are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.  
128 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Intravenous formulation 
An early phase, multi-centre open-label study was conducted in paediatric (< 18 years, n = 69) and 
young adult patients (18-30 years, n = 18) with relapsed or progressive solid tumours as well as with 
Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 
atezolizumab. Patients were treated with 15 mg/kg bw atezolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks (see 
section 5.2).  
Subcutaneous Formulation 
No dedicated studies of Tecentriq solution for injection have been conducted in paediatric patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Atezolizumab model-predicted exposure metrics following 1 875 mg Q3W subcutaneous Tecentriq 
and intravenous atezolizumab (1 200 mg Q3W) administration in the IMscin001 study are shown in 
Table 21. 
Atezolizumab cycle 1 Ctrough (i.e., pre-dose cycle 2) showed non-inferiority of atezolizumab within 
Tecentriq solution for injection to intravenous atezolizumab, with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 
1.05 (90% CI: 0.88–1.24). 
The GMR for cycle 1 model-predicted for AUC from 0 to 21 days (AUC0-21d) was 0.87 (90% CI: 
0.83–0.92). 
The maximum systemic accumulation ratio following 1 875 mg Q3W of Tecentriq solution for 
injection is 2.2. 
The model-predicted Ctrough and AUC at steady state were comparable for subcutaneous Tecentriq and 
intravenous atezolizumab (see Table 21). A pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady state is 
obtained after 6 to 9 weeks of multiple dosing.

Absorption 
Tecentriq solution for injection is administered as a subcutaneous injection.  
Based on population PK analysis of Cycle 1 data from the randomised portion of IMscin001 study the 
absolute bioavailability was 61% and the first-order absorption rate (Ka) is 0.37 (1/day). 
The atezolizumab geometric mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 189 mcg/mL and 
median time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 4.5 days. 
129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that central compartment volume of distribution is 
3.28 L and volume at steady-state is 6.91 L in the typical patient. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of atezolizumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by 
catabolism. 
Elimination 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the clearance of atezolizumab is 0.200 L/day and 
the typical terminal elimination half-life is 27 days. 
Special populations 
Based on population PK and exposure-response analyses age (21-89 years), region, ethnicity, renal 
impairment, mild hepatic impairment, level of PD-L1 expression, or ECOG performance status have 
no effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, gender, positive ADA status, albumin 
levels and tumour burden have a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant effect on 
atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments are recommended. 
Elderly 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in elderly patients. The effect of age on the 
pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was assessed in a population PK analysis. Age was not identified as 
a significant covariate influencing the PK of intravenous atezolizumab based on patients of age range 
of 21 − 89 years (n=472), and median of 62 years of age. No clinically important difference was 
observed in the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab among patients < 65 years (n = 274), patients 
between 65 − 75 years (n=152) and patients > 75 years (n = 46) (see section 4.2). 
No clinically relevant difference was observed in the PK of subcutaneous atezolizumab among 
patients < 65 years (n = 138), patients between 65 - 75 years (n = 89), and patients > 75 years of age 
(n = 19). 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetic results from one early-phase, multi-centre open-label study that was conducted 
in paediatric (< 18 years, n = 69) and young adult patients (18 - 30 years, n = 18), show that the 
clearance and volume of distribution of intravenous atezolizumab were comparable between paediatric 
patients receiving 15 mg/kg bw and young adult patients receiving 1 200 mg of intravenous 
atezolizumab every 3 weeks when normalized by body weight, with exposure trending lower in 
paediatric patients as body weight decreased. These differences were not associated with a decrease in 
atezolizumab concentrations below the therapeutic target exposure. Data for children < 2 years is 
limited thus no definitive conclusions can be made. 
No dedicated studies of Tecentriq solution for injection have been conducted in paediatric patients.  
Renal impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the clearance of 
intravenous atezolizumab were found in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=208) or, moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 116) 
renal impairment compared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or equal to 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 140) renal function. Only a few patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR 
130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 8) (see section 4.2). The effect of severe renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is unknown. 
No clinically relevant differences in the clearance of subcutaneous atezolizumab were found in 
patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 111) or moderate (eGFR 30 to 
59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 32) renal impairment compared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or 
equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 103) renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no clinically important differences in the clearance of 
intravenous or subcutaneously administered atezolizumab observed in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) or 
moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3x ULN and any AST) in comparison to patients with 
normal hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN). No data are available in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 X ULN and any AST). Hepatic impairment was defined by 
the National Cancer Institute-Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria of hepatic 
dysfunction (see section 4.2). The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any 
AST) on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of 
atezolizumab. 
Mutagenicity 
Mutagenicity studies have not been performed to establish the mutagenic potential of atezolizumab. 
However, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.  
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however, assessment of the cynomolgus 
monkey male and female reproductive organs was included in the chronic toxicity study. Weekly 
administration of intravenous atezolizumab to female monkeys at an estimated AUC approximately 6 
times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose caused an irregular menstrual cycle 
pattern and a lack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries which were reversible. There was no 
effect on the male reproductive organs.  
Teratogenicity  
No reproductive or teratogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with atezolizumab. Animal 
studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to immune-mediated 
rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Administration of atezolizumab could 
cause foetal harm, including embryo-foetal lethality. 
Subcutaneous formulation 
Hyaluronidase is found in most tissues of the human body. Non-clinical data for recombinant human 
hyaluronidase reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity including safety pharmacology endpoints. Reproductive toxicology studies with rHuPH20 
revealed embryofetal toxicity in mice at high systemic exposure but did not show teratogenic 
potential.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tecentriq is and what it is used for 
What Tecentriq is  
Tecentriq is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance atezolizumab.  
• 
• 
It belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies.  
A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target 
in the body. 
This antibody can help your immune system fight your cancer.  
• 
What Tecentriq is used for  
Tecentriq is used in adults to treat: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A kind of bladder cancer, called urothelial carcinoma 
A kind of lung cancer, called non-small cell lung cancer 
A kind of lung cancer, called small cell lung cancer 
A kind of breast cancer, called triple negative breast cancer. 
A kind of liver cancer, called hepatocellular carcinoma 
Patients may get Tecentriq when their cancer has spread to other parts of the body or has come back 
after previous treatment. 
Patients may get Tecentriq when their lung cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and 
treatment will be given after surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant 
therapy. 
Tecentriq may be given in combination with other anticancer medicines. It is important that you also 
read the package leaflets for the other anticancer medicines you may be receiving. If you have any 
questions about these medicines, ask your doctor. 
151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Tecentriq works 
Tecentriq works by attaching to a specific protein in your body called programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1). This protein suppresses the body’s immune (defence) system, thereby protecting cancer cells 
from being attacked by the immune cells. By attaching to the protein, Tecentriq helps your immune 
system to fight your cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq  
You must not be given Tecentriq  
• 
if you are allergic to atezolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have an auto-immune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) 
have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain  
have any history of inflammation of your lungs (called pneumonitis)  
have or have had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C 
(HCV) 
have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) 
have a significant cardiovascular (heart) disease or blood disorders or organ damage due to 
inadequate blood flow 
have had serious side effects because of other antibody therapies that help your immune system 
to fight cancer 
have been given medicines to stimulate your immune system   
have been given medicines to suppress your immune system 
have been given a live, attenuated vaccine 
have been given medicines to treat infections (antibiotics) in the past two weeks 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for dilution 
For the recommended dose of 840 mg: fourteen mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be withdrawn 
from the vial and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or 
polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
For the recommended dose of 1 200 mg: twenty mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be withdrawn 
from the vial and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or 
polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
For the recommended dose of 1 680 mg: twenty-eight mL of Tecentriq concentrate should be 
withdrawn from two vials of Tecentriq 840 mg and diluted into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin 
(PO), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP) infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection. 
After dilution, the final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 3.2 and 16.8 mg/mL. 
The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Once the infusion is 
prepared it should be administered immediately. 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulates and discolouration prior to 
administration. If particulates or discoloration are observed, the solution should not be used.  
No incompatibilities have been observed between Tecentriq and intravenous bags with 
product-contacting surfaces of PVC, PO, PE, or PP. In addition, no incompatibilities have been 
observed with in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone or polysulfone, and infusion sets 
and other infusion aids composed of PVC, PE, polybutadiene, or polyetherurethane. The use of in-line 
filter membranes is optional. 
Diluted solution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at ≤ 30 °C and for up 
to 30 days at 2 °C to 8 °C from the time of preparation.  
From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion should be used immediately. 
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C or 8 hours at ambient temperature 
(≤ 25 °C), unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Method of administration  
Tecentriq is for intravenous use. The infusions must not be administered as an intravenous push or 
bolus. 
The initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well 
tolerated all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. 
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line. 
Disposal 
The release of Tecentriq in the environment should be minimised. Any unused medicinal product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tecentriq is and what it is used for 
What Tecentriq is 
Tecentriq is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance atezolizumab.  
• 
• 
It belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies.  
A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target 
in the body. 
This antibody can help your immune system fight your cancer.  
• 
What Tecentriq is used for  
Tecentriq is used in adults to treat: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A kind of bladder cancer, called urothelial carcinoma 
A kind of lung cancer, called non-small cell lung cancer 
A kind of lung cancer, called small cell lung cancer 
A kind of breast cancer, called triple negative breast cancer. 
A kind of liver cancer, called hepatocellular carcinoma 
Patients may get Tecentriq when their cancer has spread to other parts of the body or has come back 
after previous treatment. 
Patients may get Tecentriq when their lung cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and 
treatment will be given after surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant 
therapy. 
Tecentriq may be given in combination with other anticancer medicines. It is important that you also 
read the package leaflets for the other anticancer medicines you may be receiving. If you have any 
questions about these medicines, ask your doctor. 
162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Tecentriq works 
Tecentriq works by attaching to a specific protein in your body called programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1). This protein suppresses the body’s immune (defence) system, thereby protecting cancer cells 
from being attacked by the immune cells. By attaching to the protein, Tecentriq helps your immune 
system to fight your cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq  
You must not be given Tecentriq  
• 
if you are allergic to atezolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have an auto-immune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) 
have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain  
have any history of inflammation of your lungs (called pneumonitis)  
have or have had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C 
(HCV) 
have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) 
have a significant cardiovascular (heart) disease or blood disorders or organ damage due to 
inadequate blood flow

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the appropriate 
formulation (intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) is being given to the patient as prescribed. 
Tecentriq solution for injection should be inspected visually to ensure there is no particulate matter or 
discolouration prior to administration. 
Tecentriq solution for injection is a ready to use solution which should NOT be diluted or mixed with 
other medicinal products. 
Tecentriq solution for injection is for single use only and should be prepared by a healthcare 
professional. 
No incompatibilities have been observed between Tecentriq solution for injection and polypropylene 
(PP), polycarbonate (PC), stainless steel (SS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyurethanes (PU). 
Preparation of the syringe 
From a microbiological point of view, Tecentriq solution for injection should be used immediately 
once transferred from the vial to the syringe since the medicine does not contain any antimicrobial-
preservative or bacteriostatic agents. 
Remove the vial from refrigerated storage and allow the solution to come to room temperature. 
• 
•  Withdraw the entire contents of Tecentriq solution for injection from the vial with a sterile 
• 
• 
• 
• 
syringe and transfer needle (18G recommended). 
Remove the transfer needle and attach a subcutaneous infusion set (e.g. winged/butterfly) 
containing a 23-25G stainless steel needle for injection. Use a subcutaneous infusion set with 
residual hold-up volume NOT exceeding 0.5 mL for administration. 
Prime the subcutaneous infusion line with the drug product solution to eliminate the air in the 
infusion line and stop before the fluid reaches the needle. 
Ensure the syringe contains exactly 15 mL of the solution after priming and expelling any 
excess volume from the syringe. 
Administer immediately to avoid needle clogging. DO NOT store the prepared syringe that has 
been attached to the already-primed subcutaneous infusion set. 
If the dose is not administered immediately, refer to “Storage of the syringe” below. 
Storage of syringe 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility 
of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless preparation 
has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.   
If the dose is not to be administered immediately, use aseptic technique to withdraw the entire 
contents of Tecentriq solution for injection from the vial into the syringe to account for the dose 
volume (15 mL) and priming volume for the subcutaneous infusion set. Replace the transfer 
needle with a syringe closing cap. DO NOT attach a subcutaneous infusion set for storage. 
The prepared syringe can be stored for up to 30 days at 2 °C to 8 °C and for up to 8 hours at 
≤30°C in diffuse daylight from the time of preparation. 
If the syringe is stored in a refrigerator, allow the syringe to reach room temperature prior to 
administration.

Method of Administration 
Tecentriq solution for injection is not intended for intravenous administration and must be given by 
subcutaneous injection only. 
Prior to administration, remove Tecentriq solution for injection from refrigeration and allow the 
solution to reach room temperature. For instructions on the use and handling of Tecentriq solution for 
injection prior to administration, refer to Section 6.6. 
Administer 15 mL of Tecentriq solution for injection subcutaneously in the thigh in approximately 
7 minutes. Use of a subcutaneous infusion set (e.g. winged/butterfly) is recommended. DO NOT 
administer the remaining residual hold-up volume in the tubing to the patient. 
The injection site should be alternated between the left and right thigh only. New injections should be 
given at least 2.5 cm from the old site and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, or 
hard. During the treatment course with Tecentriq subcutaneous formulation other medicinal products 
for subcutaneous administration should preferably be injected at different sites. 
Disposal 
The release of Tecentriq in the environment should be minimised. Any unused medicinal product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

1.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2014 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous T cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor directed against CD19 was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data in patients; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening depending on the response to 
treatment, with acute leukemic forms being fatal in a few weeks if left untreated. The main 
manifestations of the disease such as persistent fever, infections, anaemia, fatigue, 
breathlessness, bone and joint pain, are linked to invasion by the tumour cells of the bloodstream, 
the bone marrow and/or the lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs, resulting in lack of normal 
blood cells, bone marrow failure, and specific organ damage; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time the application was made; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing autologous T cells transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric 
antigen receptor directed against CD19 may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that the product was efficacious 
in patients who relapsed or were refractory to previous treatment in the condition. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
1.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma is a malignant transformation and proliferation of lymphoid 
progenitor cells in the bone marrow, blood and extramedullary sites. While 80% of the condition occurs 
in children, it represents a devastating disease when it occurs in adults. The pathogenesis of B-
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma involves the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of a clonal 
population of lymphoid cells. The hallmark of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma is chromosomal 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/581378/2018 
Page 5/18 
 
 
 
 
 
abnormalities and genetic alterations involved in differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid precursor 
cells. (Blood Cancer Journal (2017) 7, e5770) 
The WHO classification of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma is summarised below. 
Figure 1.   
Most of the clinical manifestations of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma reflect the accumulation of 
malignant, poorly differentiated lymphoid cells within the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and, 
extramedullary sites. 
Diagnosis is established by the presence of 20% or more lymphoblasts in the bone marrow or 
peripheral blood.  
The therapeutic indication “Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later 
relapse” falls within the scope of the orphan designation “B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Further to the CHMP opinion the intention to treat the orphan condition was considered justified.  
Please see EPAR - scientific discussion. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The applicant has not identified any change in the seriousness of the condition. B-lymphoblastic 
leukaemia/lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease with outcomes dependent on patient age, mutational 
status and co-morbid conditions.  
Regardless of prognostic factors, the likelihood of initial remission is ≥ 95% in children and 70 to 90% 
in adults. About 75% of children and 30 to 40% of adults have continuous disease-free survival for 5 
years and appear cured. Patients with B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma refractory to induction or 
re-induction chemotherapy have poor prognosis if they do not undergo haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT). With induction therapy, some patients achieve complete remission but the 
majority of patients relapse.  The long-term event-free survival is only 30-35%. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided an extensive and comprehensive prevalence report for B-lymphoblastic 
leukaemia/lymphoma in Europe. They have access several national registries as well as RARECARENet. 
From this they offer total point prevalence and a partial 15-year prevalence for B-lymphoblastic 
leukaemia/lymphoma which is summarised below: 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/581378/2018 
Page 6/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
In the RARECARENet database (http://app.rarecarenet.eu/)., the 15-year observed prevalence for B-
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (including Burkitt lymphoma, estimated to represent 5% of B-
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma cases in this data source) was 1.18 per 10,000 persons (95% 
confidence interval 1.16-1.20) in the EU-28, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.  
The complete prevalence estimate for B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma patients diagnosed in 
the EU-28, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway at any time and alive on 01 January 2008 was 4.27 
per 10,000 for the EU-28 and Liechtenstein, 2.46 per 10,000 for Iceland, and 2.38 per 10,000 for 
Norway.  
Both proposed values are below the 5 in 10,000 threshold. The COMP decided to designate 1.2 per 
10,000 in line with the RARECARENet 15-year prevalence figure. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of designation in 2013 there were several products authorised in Europe for the condition: 
cyclophosphamide monohydrate, cytarabine, asparaginase, daunorubicin hydrochloride, doxorubicin 
hydrochloride, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine sulphate, clofarabine, dasatinib, imatinib, 
nelarabine, ponatinib.  
Since then the sponsor has noted that several products have been authorised namely: inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, blinatumomab and 6-mercaptopurine monohydrate.  
A specific European Guideline for the treatment and management of the condition has also been 
published by ESMO (Annals of Oncology 27 (Supplement 5):v69-v82, 2016). A paediatric guideline for 
the condition does not appear to exist although there are well written reviews of how to manage 
paediatric patients with the condition such as Pediatr Clin North Am. 2015 February ; 62(1): 61–73.  
According to the current ESMO guidelines for ALL (Annals of Oncology 27 (Supplement 5): v69–v82, 
2016) the treatment schedule can be summarised in the following manner: 
•  Newly diagnosed ALL: A pre-phase therapy with corticosteroids alone, or in combination with 
another drug (e.g. vincristine, cyclophosphamide), is often given together with allopurinol and 
hydration Remission induction therapy and consolidation treatment: Most regimens are centred on 
vincristine, corticosteroids, and anthracycline (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, rubidazone, idarubicin), 
with or without cyclophosphamide or cytarabine. L-Asparaginase is the only ALL-specific drug that 
depletes the asparagine levels.  
•  Maintenance therapy: Maintenance therapy usually consists of daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly 
methotrexate. In some treatment regimens, repeated cycles of vincristine, dexamethasone or 
• 
• 
other drugs in monthly or longer intervals are given. 
Targeted therapy:  
The bispecific antibody blinatumomab combines single chain antibodies to CD19 and CD3, and 
thereby T cells lyse the CD19-bearing B cells. It is effective in patients with positive MRD or 
refractory/relapsed ALL. Stem-cell transplantation. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/581378/2018 
Page 7/18 
 
 
 
 
•  Relapsed or refractory ALL: There is no universally accepted treatment protocol. For B-Cell 
Precursor ALL, blinatumuab and inotuzumab is indicated. 
•  Chemotherapy for relapsed ALL. The most commonly used regimens in Europe are fludarabine- and 
anthracycline-containing regimens, for example, FLAG-Ida (fludarabine, high-dose ara-C, 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and idarubicin).  
Significant benefit 
Three new products have been authorised since the sponsor’s initial orphan designation. These are 
mercaptopurine, blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin. Only mercaptopurine is indicated for use 
in children. The other two are indicated for use in adults only.  
Their respective indications are: 
•  Mercaptopurine: Xaluprine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in 
adults, adolescents and children.  
•  Blinatumomab: BLINCYTO is indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome 
negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
• 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin:” BESPONSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with 
relapsed or refractory CD22- positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Adult 
patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL 
should have failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).” 
Kymriah has obtained the following indication: “Paediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of 
age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in 
second or later relapse” 
According to the ESMO Guidelines from 2016: “Relapsed ALL in adults is still a major clinical challenge. 
There is no universally accepted treatment protocol and a lack of evidence based on randomised, 
controlled trials. However, there is consensus on the general approach to managing these patients.” 
It is noted in paediatric patients that: Despite significant advances in treatment, approximately 15% to 
20% of patients with ALL will suffer relapsed disease, the most common cause of treatment failure. 
With intensive therapy that may include HSCT, overall survival from relapsed ALL is approximately 
40%. (Pediatr Clin North Am. 2015 February ; 62(1): 61–73.) 
The sponsor claims that they will offer a clinically relevant advantage in paediatric and young adult 
patients who are refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. To support this 
claim the sponsor has supported data from their main study CTL019B2202 (ELIANA).  
The target patient population was aged 3 to 25 years and were: primary refractory, chemo-refractory, 
relapsed after allogeneic SCT, or were otherwise ineligible for allogeneic SCT. The average number of 
prior chemotherapy regimens was 3.4. With a median number of previous lines of treatment of 3, at 
least half of the patients were in their 3rd or 4th relapse. Median age at initial diagnosis was 7.5 years. 
Patients infused were between the ages of 3 and 23 years with 41.3% <10 years of age, 41.3% ≥ 10 
to <18 years and 17.3% ≥ 18 years. These are patients for whom there is limited or no treatment and 
where there is currently an unmet need. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate 
(ORR) during the 3 months following tisagenlecleucel administration per modified NCCN Guidelines for 
response in ALL as measured by IRC. The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best 
overall disease response of complete response (CR) or CRi, where the best overall disease response is 
defined as the best disease response recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until the start of new 
anticancer therapy. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/581378/2018 
Page 8/18 
 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of remission (DOR), relapse free survival (RFS), event-
free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). 
The results of obtained from this study showed the following for primary endpoint:

Results of the B2202 study demonstrated that a single infusion with tisagenlecleucel shows a high 
increase of ORR in aggressive relapsed or refractory B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. 
The table below helps to contextualise the effect size of Kymriah compared to treatments used in B-
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. Although the patient populations are not the same, as the 
Kymriah patients are chemoresistant and the patients in the other studies were chemosensitive, the 
overall survival of 19.1 months should be noted.

Full analysis set (FAS), all patients who received an infusion of tisagenlecleuce 
The data submitted by the sponsor shows that Kymriah offers a clinically relevant advantage primarily 
in paediatric patients and young adult patients up to 25 years of age, who have already received 3 
previous lines of therapy, who are refractory, in relapse post-transplant, or in second or later relapse. 
The COMP noted that there are no alternative treatments for this advanced stage of the disease in 
these patients. The significant benefit of Kymriah is therefore based on the clinical relevant advantage 
in this patient population and treatment setting.

1.4.  COMP position adopted on 19 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 1.2 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening depending on the response to 
treatment, with acute leukaemic forms being fatal in a few weeks if left untreated. The main 
manifestations of the disease such as persistent fever, infections, anaemia, fatigue, 
breathlessness, bone and joint pain, are linked to invasion by the tumour cells of the bloodstream, 
the bone marrow and/or the lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs, resulting in the lack of 
normal blood cells, bone marrow failure, and specific organ damage; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Kymriah is of significant benefit in paediatric and young adult patients 
with B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma who presented with primary refractory or chemo-
refractory disease or relapsed after allogeneic SCT still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical 
data which shows improved outcomes compared to published data when their product was used as 
salvage in these patients who otherwise have a poor prognosis. The COMP was of the opinion that 
this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kymriah, autologous T cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor directed against CD19, 
tisagenlecleucel, EU/3/14/1266 for treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma is not removed 
from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

2.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2016 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous T cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor directed against CD19 was 
considered justified based on preclinical data and preliminary clinical data showing antitumor 
activity of the proposed product; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow, and life-threatening with 5-year 
survival rates reported as low as approximately one in four patients for the high risk group; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 4.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing autologous T cells transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric 
antigen receptor directed against CD19 will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data showing favourable responses in 
patients affected by the condition relapsing from previous treatments. The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition.

2.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 30% to 40% of all newly diagnosed cases. It has an unknown 
aetiology. A family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity, a high body mass as a young adult and some 
occupational exposures have been identified as risk factors of DLBCL. (Annals of Oncology 26 
(Supplement 5): v116–v125, 2015) 
DLBCL occurs in adult patients, with a median age in the seventh decade, but the age range is broad, 
and it may also occur in children. Clinical presentation and prognosis are variable, depending mainly of 
the extranodal site when they arise. These malignancies present in localised manner in approximately 
20% of patients. Disseminated extranodal disease is less frequent, and one third of patients have 
systemic symptoms (Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology 87 (2013) 146–171). 
The 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms (Swerdlow et 
al, Blood 2016 127:2375-2390) makes additions to the DLBCL entity. In particular, DLBCL-NOS (with 
two further subtypes added compared to the previous 2008 version, Germinal center B-cell type, and 
activated B-cell type), Primary DLBCL of the CNS, Primary cutaneous DLBCL, EBV+DLBCL NOS (new 
modification), HHV8+DLBCL NOS (new addition), DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation, T-cell 
histiocytic rich large B cell lymphoma are all listed in the new classification. The therapeutic indication 
“Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy” falls within the scope of the orphan designation “diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Further to the CHMP opinion the intention to treat the orphan condition was considered justified.  
Please see EPAR - scientific discussion. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The applicant has not identified any change in the seriousness of the condition. In Europe, the 5-year 
overall survival is around 60% (Haematologica March 2017 102: 584-592). The COMP was of the 
opinion that the sponsor has provided sufficient evidence that the condition is life-threatening. The 
condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal sites, 
including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. Although the overall cure rate of DLBCL is 60-
70%, about 30-40% of patients relapse and 10% have refractory disease. Refractory/relapsed DLBCL 
is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with an expected mortality in <6 months. Mortality is also 
higher when the age or comorbidities limit tolerability of chemotherapy.

Number of people affected or at risk 
The estimated age-standardised (to the European population) incidence rate reported by the sponsor 
was 6.60 (6.60–6.70) per 100,000 person-years.  
The sponsor provided 5-year and 10-yearr survival rates from 17 different publications many of which 
are after 2010. The data presented range from the 1980s to as recent as 2014. From this compilation 
of publications the sponsor proposes an overall 5-year survival of ~45% and a 10-year survival 
between 20-37%. Recent publications report current estimates for 5-year survival in Europe of 60%. 
The survival rates proposed appear to be an under-estimate and this could be down to the mix of older 
publications with the newer ones. The literature reports that the introduction of rituximab has 
improved survival in these patients significantly, which the sponsor has not discussed (Pathology, 
(January 2018) 50(1),pp74-87;Ann Haemtol (2015)94:803-812). Data from several national and 
international registries were also presented. For example Globocan data from 2012 and the Rarecare 
report from 2014 are discussed. Each offers observations as to what the current partial prevalences of 
the condition could be in Europe. There is no discussion of point prevalence nor the complexities of the 
different subgroups and survival associated with them.  
It was noted that the data from some of the national registries were more current than that derived 
from scientific publications submitted. From these national registries the sponsor reports for example a 
10-year partial prevalence based on the Haematological Malignancy Research Network HMRN database 
in York  UK of 4.63 per 10,000 [estimated from data on patients diagnosed from 2004 through 2014 
(HMRN, 2015)]. A 15-year prevalence is reported from the AIRTUM group in Italy with 4.14 per 10,000 
population (Italian cancer figures-Report 2015)  
Both the UK and Italian data bases offer more recent insight than Rarecare, Globocan and other 
sources used. The COMP accepted the partial prevalence estimates from these national sources with 
the highest prevalence of 4.6 in 10,000 as reported by the HMRN database..  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Several medicinal products are authorised for broader indications such as Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 
and the COMP has previously considered them satisfactory in the treatment of DLBCL and should be 
considered for the purpose of significant benefit. These include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, 
bendamustine, bleomycin, vincristine, vindesine, etoposide, iphosphamide, chlorabucil, lomustine, 
prednisone, and prednisolone. Previously the COMP has also considered rituximab, docetaxel, 
mitoxantrone, methotrexate, epirubicin, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and pixantrone. 
ESMO guidelines exist for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Tilly et al. Ann Oncol (2015) 
26 (suppl 5): v116-v125). Specifically for the relapsed refractory settings, which is the focus of this 
orphan maintenance procedure the following recommendations stand: 
• 
In patients aged <65–70 years with good performance status and no major organ dysfunction, 
salvage regimens with rituximab and chemotherapy followed, in responsive patients, by HDC and 
ASCT, are recommended. Salvage regimens such as R-DHAP (rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, 
dexamethasone) or R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) appear to have similar 
outcomes. R-GDP (rituximab, cisplatin, gemcitabine, dexamethasone) is also recommended in the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/581378/2018 
Page 15/18 
 
 
 
 
ESMO guidelines. BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan) is the most commonly 
used high-dose regimen.  
• 
Patients not suitable for high-dose therapy may be treated with the same or other salvage 
regimens as R-GEMOX (rituximab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin). Pixantrone, is also discussed in these 
guidelines as an option in heavily pre-treated patients.

Significant benefit 
The sponsor has submitted data from study CTL019C2201 (JULIET) designed to support efficacy and 
safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLBCL. This is a single arm, open-label, multicentre Phase 
2 study. Patient population was defined as adult patients ≥ 18 years with r/r DLBCL after ≥ 2 lines of 
chemotherapy and not eligible for SCT. The ESMO guidelines do not indicate that there is any 
recommended chemotherapy for these patients.  
The COMP initially considered that the data from the Juliet study could be inconclusive regarding the 
clinically relevant advantage the product in this target patient population as the patients had 
previously received many different treatment regimens, which makes it difficult to identify a 
homogenous group of patients that could benefit. A significant benefit on the grounds of a major 
contribution to patient care was not supported by the Quality of Life data that was submitted.  
In response to the COMP’s concerns the sponsor further provided indirect historical comparisons to 
three studies namely SCHOLAR-1, PIX301 and CORAL. SCHOLAR-1 was an international, multicohort 
retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research study, evaluating responses and OS rates in patients 
with refractory NHL, including DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal 
B cell lymphoma (PMBCL). 
SCHOLAR-1 pooled data from the observational follow-up of 2 phase 3 clinical trials (Lymphoma 
Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational 
cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic (IA/MC) Lymphoma 
Specialized Program of Research Excellence). Only the published aggregated data for SCHOLAR-1 was 
submitted (Crump et al 2017).

The Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) study was a collaborative effort by 
12 countries worldwide. Patients with refractory or relapsed CD20 DLBCL were randomly assigned to 
one of the following two widely used regimens that included rituximab: rituximab, ifosfamide, 
carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE)13 or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and 
cisplatin(R-DHAP) (Gisselbrecht C et al 2010). CORAL consisted of pooled data from two extension 
studies in DLBCL patients, who relapsed after ASCT (n=75) and patients, who failed to proceed to per-
protocol ASCT (n=203). ORR was 40.3% with CR 28.4%. Median OS from last relapse was 5.8 months 
(95% CI: 4.7, 7.2). 
PIX301 was a randomised trial of pixantrone versus chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, 
aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients with prior rituximab treatment use, who received 
pixantrone as third or fourth line treatment, were included. ORR was 30% with CR 20%. 
Out of the three comparisons the indirect comparison between the Juliet (2201) and Coral offered the 
most relevant guidance on the clinically relevant advantage of using Kymriah in the treatment of 
advanced relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients over the authorised counterparts. 
The sponsor conducted matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) and used individual level data 
from C2201 to match baseline summary statistics reported from CORAL extensions. It was observed 
that the complete response rate observed in the Juliet study (40.6%) was in the range of what has 
been observed with other treatment modalities (28.4%, CORAL studies). However, the duration of 
response when compared to the CORAL study was considered remarkable, with more than 60% of 
responders still responding after a median follow-up of 19 months in patients treated with Kymriah. 
Overall, based on the response rate and duration of response, and given the available treatment 
options, the clinical benefit was considered established despite of the limitations of time-dependent 
endpoints in single arm trials. 
Figure 2.   
The COMP considered these findings represent a clinically relevant advantage in the treatment of a 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient population thereby supporting the basis of significant benefit.

2.4.  COMP position adopted on 19 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening with 5-year survival rates reported as 
low as approximately 25% for high risk patients; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union Kymriah may be of potential significant benefit to patients who have refractory diffuse large 
B-cell Lymphoma for whom there are very limited treatment options. The sponsor has provided 
clinical data which would support improved outcomes when their product was used as a third line 
treatment in these patients. In contrast with other treatment options with a potential for long-term 
improvement (HSCT), the treatment with the proposed product does not require the patients to 
obtain a response to chemotherapy. The COMP was of the opinion that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kymriah, autologous T cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor directed against CD19, 
tisagenlecleucel, EU/3/16/1745 for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

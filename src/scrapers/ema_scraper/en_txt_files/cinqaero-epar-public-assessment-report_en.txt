2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Asthma is a common, heterogeneous disease characterised by inflammation and clinically defined by respiratory 
symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness together with variable 
expiratory airflow limitation. In addition, asthma is often characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness to direct 
or indirect stimuli (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2014). 
Many factors can influence the development of asthma or trigger asthma-related symptoms, including those 
related to the individual patient and factors related to the environment surrounding the patient with asthma 
(Bacharier et al 2008, Ege et al 2011, GINA 2014, Vijverberg et al 2011).  
The goals of asthma treatment are control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations with minimal 
drug-related side effects. Well-controlled asthma is indicated by symptoms that occur less frequently than twice 
per week (including the need for reliever use), normal lung function, no awakenings due to asthma, and no 
activity limitation due to asthma.  
Asthma that is uncontrolled is not the same as severe asthma. Classification of the severity of asthma is based 
on the level of treatment required to control symptoms. The intensity of treatment is defined by step-wise 
treatment recommendations (GINA).  
Asthma severity in clinical can be assessed when the patient has been on regular controller treatment for 
months.  
•  Mild asthma is asthma that is well controlled with step 1 or step 2 treatment, 
•  Moderate asthma is asthma that is well controlled with step 3 treatment, 
•  Severe asthma is asthma that requires step 4 or step 5 treatment. 
“Asthma control” refers to the extent to which the manifestations of asthma have been reduced or removed by 
treatment.  
Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes. Future risks are 
characterised by identifying whether a patient is at risk of adverse asthma outcomes, particularly exacerbations 
fixed airflow imitation and side effects of medication. Asthma symptom control and exacerbation risk may have 
different causes and may need different treatment options. 
The majority of patients with asthma can achieve good symptom control and minimal exacerbations with regular 
controller treatment. However, some patients remain uncontrolled due to truly refractory asthma. For these 
patients, who remain inadequately controlled on medium-to-high dose ICS plus a long-acting beta-agonist 
(LABA), there are few therapeutic alternatives beyond the add-on treatment with oral corticosteroids (OCSs) 
and/or (for patients with perennial allergies) anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE). Adverse effects of prolonged 
high-dose inhaled or systemic corticosteroid use are well known and include, among others, infection, adrenal 
suppression, cataract formation, osteoporosis, and aggravation of diabetes.  
From the already authorised asthma treatments, omalizumab, a recombinant humanised mAb (IgG1) is 
recommended for use in GINA Step 5 (add-on treatment for allergic asthma), but only a small proportion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 9/108 
  
  
patients with severe asthma are appropriate candidates for its use based on specific weight and IgE levels in 
addition to a positive test for a perennial allergen. Anti-IgE has demonstrated modest efficacy on asthma 
exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma, with small and highly variable effects on lung function (Busse et 
al 2001, Hanania et al 2011, Humbert et al 2005, Solér et al 2001).  
Eosinophilic Asthma Phenotype 
The failure of guideline-based, stepped-care therapy to adequately control a substantial proportion of asthma 
patients has been attributed to heterogeneity in aetiology (e.g., allergic, non-allergic, or occupational), severity, 
physiologic parameters (e.g., reversible or fixed obstruction), and underlying inflammatory pathology (Bradding 
and Green 2010, Gibson 2009).  
Eosinophilic asthma has emerged as a distinctive asthma phenotype (Walford and Doherty 2014, Wenzel et al 
1999, Wenzel 2012). Eosinophilic asthma has been associated with the key pathophysiological and clinical 
features of asthma, including airway remodelling with associated persistent airflow limitation and poor clinical 
control with risk of asthma exacerbation (Balzar et al 2005, Green et al 2002, Jatakanon et al 2000, Petsky et al 
2012, Robinson 1995, Saglani et al 2007, ten Brinke et al 2001, Wenzel et al 1999). Inhaled corticosteroids 
reduce the number of airways eosinophils, but despite treatment, airway eosinophilia may still persist. Recent 
large epidemiological surveys indicate that elevated blood eosinophil levels are an independent risk factor for 
future asthma exacerbations (Malinovschi et al 2013, Tran et al 2014, Zeiger et al 2014), and this observation 
has been incorporated into the most recent expert asthma guidance (GINA 2015). 
The anti IL-5 antibody mepolizumamb (Nucala) was authorised in the European Union in December 2015 as 
add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. 
About the product 
Reslizumab (CINQAERO) is a humanized anti-human interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (anti IL-5 mAb) of the 
immunoglobulin-G4 kappa (IgG4/к) isotype. It works by binding to IL-5 thereby preventing its binding to the 
IL-5 receptor and consequently reduces circulating and tissue eosinophils.  
Reslizumab contains the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the original rat anti-human IL-5 
antibody 39D10 grafted onto a human framework which is produced in the murine myeloma NS0 expression 
system.  
Proposed indication 
CINQAERO is indicated to reduce exacerbations, relieve symptoms and improve lung function in adult patients 
with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. 
Proposed posology 
The recommended dose of reslizumab is 3.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks, given as an intravenous infusion. 
Of note, the initial development studies were performed by Schering-Plough (Schering), and included 
evaluations of non-clinical safety, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Schering also performed clinical 
studies in patients with asthma and in patients with nasal polyposis. Ception Therapeutics (later owned by 
Cephalon) subsequently continued the development of reslizumab for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis 
in paediatric subjects, asthma, and other eosinophil-mediated diseases. At present, Teva Pharmaceutical 
Industries (Teva) has taken ownership of the molecule.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent 
application. 
The reslizumab i.v. clinical program comprises fourteen clinical studies, including six Phase 3 studies, four Phase 
2 studies, and four Phase 1 studies; thirteen of these studies are completed, and one study (Study 3085) was 
ongoing at the time of data cut-off (01 September 2014) and is currently concluding. Besides studies in patients 
with an eosinophilic asthma phenotype which is the subject of the current MAA, studies have been performed in 
other patients populations as well (patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, 
eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and nasal polyposis). These are included in support of safety.  
CHMP guidance for development of asthma treatment is available in the form of a revised Note for guidance on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for treatment of asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 – released in 
December 2015). 
The Applicant obtained feedback on the development of reslizumab for asthma three times (November 2010, 
July 2014 and February 2015). The first advice concerned the intravenous formulation; the other advices are 
related to a subcutaneous formulation which is not part of the current MAA.  
The CHMP gave advice related to the use of a combined pharmacokinetic and toxicology study in monkey using 
both iv and sc administration, to support sc administration in humans. Further, the CHMP considered that the 26 
week study in a transgenic mouse model was adequate to describe the overall carcinogenicity potential of 
reslizumab, but advised the Applicant to provide a comprehensive review on the role of IL-5 and eosinophils in 
tumour biology and/or anti-tumour responses. The Applicant was also advised to address the cross-reactivity of 
reslizumab with human and Cynomolgus brain tissue further. 
The requested SA for the i.v. formulation concerned the selection of study population, choice of the primary and 
key secondary endpoints, proposed efficacy analyses, collection of safety data, and inclusion of adolescent 
patients (12-17 years of age). It was highlighted that a 6-month study duration might be too short for the 
exacerbation studies. Further, it was advised to reduce the upper limit for the oral steroid criterion from planned 
10mg/day, since this increases the risk of the recruitment of essentially untreatable patients with a high risk for 
dropouts. Overall, the amended programme (extension of study duration to 12 months, studying additional 
doses) was considered acceptable to support an indication in the given subpopulation of asthma patients. As a 
response to the EMA advice, an additional study (Study 3084) was conducted in patients with asthma who were 
unselected for blood eosinophils to ensure that the phenotype of the target population could be sufficiently 
defined, since the degree of correlation between blood eosinophilia and sputum eosinophilia had not been fully 
established. 
Notably, at the time of the SA the Applicant has presented a criterion of 2 exacerbations/previous year as 
inclusion criterion. The inclusion criteria for the submitted pivotal exacerbation studies has been changed to 1 
exacerbation in the previous year. Further, the primary endpoint was changed during the studies and FEV1 was 
ultimately not included in the primary endpoint in either of the exacerbation studies as presented at the time of 
SA; however, it was analysed as the first key secondary endpoint in each study.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of CINQAERO is reslizumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG 4 subtype produced in NS0 cells. Reslizumab binds specifically to interleukin-5 (IL-5), thereby neutralizing 
the biological activity of this cytokine.  
Reslizumab is formulated in an acetate buffer solution containing sodium acetate, sucrose. The finished product 
is supplied as a 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Reslizumab is a humanized anti-human interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5 mAb) of the 
immunoglobulin-G4 kappa (IgG4/к) isotype, which contains the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 
(i.e., antigen-binding regions) of the original rat antihuman antibody 39D10 grafted onto a human framework.   
Reslizumab has a characteristic IgG4 structure including two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains 
linked by 16 disulfide bonds (4 inter-chain disulfide bonds and 12 intrachain disulfide bonds). The two 
post-translational modifications are the conserved N-linked glycosylation on the CH2 domain of the heavy chain 
at asparagine 293 (Asn293) and loss of C-terminal lysine residue of the heavy chain. N-linked oligosaccharides 
of reslizumab are core fucosylated, bi-antennary, and complex type glycans, as expected for IgG4 antibodies 
derived from NS0 cell lines.  
Reslizumab has a theoretical molecular mass of 146,776 Da calculated for the antibody with two C terminally 
clipped lysine residues and two G1F glycans.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Reslizumab is expressed in a NS0 murine myeloma cells which has been engineered for product expression using 
a glutamine synthetase promotor system. The cGMP Master Cell Bank was established in 1994. The MCB was 
used to prepare multiple working cell banks (WCB), providing a conventional two-tiered cell bank system. The 
MCB and the currently used serum-free WCB (established in 2006) have been tested to confirm their identity 
and purity in accordance with the ICH guidelines Q5A and Q5D. The Applicant has demonstrated the genetic 
stability of the cell banks. No adventitious agents, with the exception of A- and C-type retrovirus-like particles 
in the MCB, were detected.   
Other Manufacturer Working Cell Banks were initially prepared and used for the production of reslizumab active 
substance tested in the toxicology and Phase 1 clinical studies. A summary of the characterization and safety 
test results of these cell banks have been provided.   
Manufacturing process 
Reslizumab active substance is manufactured at Lonza Biologics Inc. Portsmouth, NGH 03810, USA (Lonza US). 
One production bioreactor leads to one bulk active substance lot. Bulk active substance lots are not combined at 
the active substance stage. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 12/108 
  
  
The upstream manufacturing process starts with cells from a single ampoule of the WCB are propagated via two 
steps: Inoculum Expansion, and Cell Culture. The final cell culture production in the bioreactor is followed by the 
Primary Recovery step.  
The purification of Reslizumab consists of three chromatography column steps, three concentration and 
diafiltration steps and two viral control steps (a low pH viral inactivation step and a viral reduction filtration step). 
The purification starts with affinity-chromatography and is subsequently followed by a low pH treatment step, 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) concentration, anion exchange chromatography, UF/DF concentration, cation 
exchange chromatography, viral reduction filtration and concentrated with a final UF/DF. Excipients are added 
to reslizumab and the bulk is then 0.22 μm filtered into sterile disposable containers.  The containers are stored 
at 2-8°C pending batch disposition.   
There are no process intermediates in the reslizumab active substance manufacturing process. For each step the 
manufacturing details are indicated (e.g. the temperature, load, reuse of filters/resin, cleaning and storage of 
resin/filters, holding time/temperature of the intermediate step). 
Reprocessing is allowed for the viral reduction filtration and the final 0.22 μm filtration before filling. 
Process controls 
The Applicant has provided a list of critical quality attributes which were deemed to be appropriate. In order to 
identify critical process parameters (CPPs), the Applicant developed the control strategy by conducting two risk 
assessments; the first was based on a risk matrix where the risk of deviation and the risk to quality were 
considered. The second was a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) which considered severity, occurrence 
and detection. Information derived from both risk assessments and the studies that were triggered by risk 
assessments over the course of development were utilized as a whole to determine potential criticality of 
process parameters in the current process. Following the risk assessment, small scale experiments were used to 
test the criticality of the identified potential CPPs. Appropriate data were provided to show that these small scale 
studies were representative of the full scale manufacturing process. Overall the data used to justify the 
designation of process parameters as critical or non-critical was acceptable and the identified list of CPPs was 
endorsed. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process was validated according to a defined process validation master plan. 
Three consecutive active substance batches were manufactured at the commercial scale in 2008. One of these 
Batches was run at extended cell generation numbers near the edge of the process limit for cell generations as 
defined in the fermentation process description.  
During the process validation additional in process samples were collected and assayed for purity by isoelectric 
focusing (IEF), reduced and non-reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE), Gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC) and for residual process 
impurities. Analytical testing and characterization was performed to assess the quality of the process validation 
batches. 
As a part of process validation, resin reuse and cleaning, viral clearance, impurity clearance, viral filtration 
reprocessing, final filtration reprocessing and bulk active substance shipping were also validated at either 
manufacturing-scale or laboratory-scale using scaled-down models representative of the proposed 
manufacturing scale. Where appropriate, results from supporting validation studies (e.g., hold time studies, 
membrane re-use, resin re-use, etc.) are included for each relevant unit operation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 13/108 
  
  
Reprocessing across the viral filter and reprocessing of the 0.22 μm filtration step have been validated.  
Based on review of the release and additional characterization data, it can be concluded that the validated 
process can produce active substance batches that are consistent in quality and conform to the reference 
standard. 
A continued process verification system is in place. Three batches have been produced under this protocol in 
2014 and also demonstrate that the active substance manufacturing process is consistent and all in-process 
controls are within acceptable ranges specified. Process changes introduced after manufacture of the process 
validation batches in 2008 have been described and are considered minor. 
Characterisation  
Reslizumab has been well characterised using several orthogonal approaches and all relevant aspects of 
primary, secondary and tertiary structure, charge variants, aggregation, purity, potency have been examined.  
The primary structure of reslizumab was well characterized with respect to complete sequence verification, 
terminal sequences, post-translational modifications, disulfide bond linkage, monosachride composition and 
glycan structure using a variety of analytical approaches. The secondary and tertiary structures of reslizumab 
were evaluated using multiple biophysical techniques. The high order structure analysis shows reslizumab 
predominantly contains β-sheets and buried tryptophans, indicating a folded and well defined structure. 
SDS-PAGE, GP-HPLC, IEF and to a limited extent the potency assay are stability indicating. A thermal stress 
study (55 °C up to 4 weeks) was performed to provide more insight into the degradation pathway of reslizumab. 
Degradation in the form of aggregation, fragmentation and deamidation was observed and to a much lesser 
extent deglycosylation and oxidation.  
Specification 
Specifications have been established to ensure the identity, purity, biological activity (potency), safety, and 
consistency of the reslizumab active substance.  
A cell-based method has been used to determine the potency of reslizumab for lot release and stability testing. 
For this cell-based method, reslizumab binds to interleukin-5 (IL-5), which prevents IL-5 from binding to the 
IL-5 receptor on the target cells. By blocking IL-5 binding to the IL-5 receptor, cell proliferation is inhibited. The 
bioassay measures the relative potency of reslizumab by measuring the number of viable cells in culture after 
addition of reslizumab in various concentrations and IL-5 at a constant concentration.  
The proposed commercial release and stability specification for reslizumab were based on the current 
understanding of process capability and assay variability, and are also supported by clinical experience and 
product intended use.     
Methods and validation 
The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of the active substance have been appropriately 
described. The suitability of these analytical procedures for their intended purposes was established through 
either verification (compendial) or validation (non-compendial).  
Adequate validation reports have also been provided for the methods used during development and for 
assessment of active substance and finished product stability. 
Reference Material 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 14/108 
  
  
The reference standards are representative of the manufacturing procedure and are used for active substance as 
well as finished product testing. The results of release and characterisation testing have been provided for the 
three reference standards used so far. An adequate qualification protocol for future working standards has been 
provided, as well as stability protocols for the current reference standard and future reference standards.  
Stability 
Results from long-term stability studies of the process validation batches have been provided. Additional 
stability studies were conducted at accelerated and stressed storage conditions, and at -80°C to explore the 
stability of reslizumab finished product at frozen storage conditions. The accelerated and stressed storage 
condition stability data indicate that SDS-PAGE, GP-HPLC, IEF, BIAcore and the Potency bioassay are capable of 
detecting changes in the product over time at increased temperature and humidity..  
Comparability exercise for Active Substance  
The manufacturing process has evolved throughout development and included the original Schering 
manufacturing process, the Ception process by Lonza UK and the current commercial manufacturing process at 
5000L scale by Lonza US.  Adequate comparability studies including comparison to Schering lots, scale change 
and site change (Lonza UK to Lonza US) have been provided. Comparability is considered demonstrated.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished medicinal product is a sterile, unpreserved, clear to slightly opalescent aqueous solution for infusion 
supplied in 10 ml single-use vials containing 100 mg of reslizumab. The product is packaged in a type I clear, 
borosilicate glass vial, stoppered with a rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium flip-off seal. The finished 
product is diluted with saline prior to use. The active substance and finished product formulation differ only in 
the active ingredient concentration (12 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml respectively). The active substance is diluted in a 
quantity of the same acetate-sucrose buffer system used for the active substance. 
The formulation of the finished product has remained unchanged from clinical studies to proposed commercial 
formulation. 
The robustness of the finished product formulation has been considered by varying the formulation. Many 
(heavy) visual particulates were found when the product is formulated at a combination of high pH and sodium 
acetate content.  
As particles are observed routinely in the finished product, it is recommended that an in-line filter be used at the 
point of administration and the Applicant has performed in-line filtration studies demonstrating that no visible 
particles are observed after in-line filtration (0.22 µm filter). A compatibility study demonstrated that the 
recommended in-line filters do not impact on product quality.   
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been adequately described and includes a standard formulation and aseptic 
filling process that consists of buffer formulation and bioburden reduction filtration, bulk active substance 
pooling, formulation and sterile filtration, filling and capping, and final 100% inspection and packaging. 
Appropriate in-process tests are performed on pooled bulk active substance, after initial dilution, final dilution, 
before sterile filtration and during filling. There are no process intermediates. Appropriate hold times at various 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 15/108 
  
  
stages of manufacture have been set. Raw materials and container components (including filters) are 
adequately defined.  
Process validation studies were carried out and four commercial scale process validation batches were 
manufactured. Hold time periods were validated and appropriate process parameters were established. The 
process validation batches passed all in-process control tests and complied with finished product specifications. 
Distribution/Agitation/shaking studies support the quality of the finished product in the proposed primary and 
secondary container closure systems. The sterilising filters were qualified in terms of microbial retention and 
extractables/leachables.  
The excipients used are compendial. There are no novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes test methods for identity, protein concentration, biological activity 
(potency), purity, safety and pharmaceutical properties. The release panel of testing methods and the 
corresponding criteria are applicable to both release and stability.  
The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of the finished product have been appropriately 
described. The suitability of these analytical procedures for their intended purposes was established through 
either verification (compendial) or validation (non-compendial).  
Given that the finished product formulation is the same as the active substance and there is only a minimal 
difference in concentration between finished product and active substance prior to dilution for analysis and no 
difference in concentration following dilution for analysis, the active substance validations are considered to 
demonstrate suitability of the analytical procedures for analysis of both active substance and finished product. 
Batch analysis data have been presented for eight 100 mg/vial batches. The batch analysis data presented are 
considered satisfactory. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been carried out in line with relevant guidance. The primary stability study encompasses 
three process validation batches that were also used in the phase 3 studies. Samples maintained in the inverted 
as well as samples in the upright position were included to determine the effects of the closure on product quality. 
These studies indicate no relevant changes in any of the attributes after 36 months of storage at the 
recommended long-term storage condition 2-8°C.  
Based on the data provided the claimed shelf life of 36 months at 2-8 °C protected from light is considered 
acceptable for the finished product. The quality of the diluted product is considered to be acceptable when used 
in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA.  
Container closure system 
The suitability of the container closure has been discussed. Materials meet compendial requirements and 
suitability of the container closure has been demonstrated by real time, accelerated and stressed stability 
studies. Dye ingress and sterility testing on stability confirms the integrity of the container closure. Extractable 
and leachable studies have also been carried out; results are summarised and indicate that there is no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 16/108 
  
  
 
 
significant accumulation of leachables in aged finished product stored at the recommended storage conditions. 
The microbial attributes of the finished product are adequately discussed including procedures in place to 
minimise the risk of microbial contamination and the results of microbial ingress challenge studies. The data 
supports the appropriateness of the proposed container closure. Compatibility studies have been provided and 
are considered adequate. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of biological origin used in routine manufacture of the finished product. Cell banks have 
been extensively tested for adventitious as well as endogenous agents. The low probability of adventitious agent 
transmission via raw materials was confirmed by the information presented and, along with the negative full 
adventitious agent test results, provides evidence of a low risk of transmission of viral or TSE agents. 
Viral clearance studies were performed for the chromatography steps (, the low pH viral inactivation step, and 
the nanofiltration step using appropriate model viruses. These studies provide evidence that the production 
process could remove adventitious virus contamination and the overall inactivation/removal capacity is 
regarded as sufficient.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The descriptions of the manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product presented were 
sufficiently and adequately detailed. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active 
substance and finished product has been provided in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, which leads to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During the procedure additional data have been presented on the designation of critical quality attributes and 
the risk assessment strategies used to assign potential critical process parameters. The proposed control 
strategy is well described and supported by appropriate data.  
The Applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the active substance and finished product specifications when 
data from additional lots are available. 
Regarding the residual host cell proteins ELISA the Applicant is recommended to further substantiate that the 
anti-HCP antibodies recognize a broad range of HCPs representative of the manufacturing process. 
Several active substance manufacturing processes were used in the course of development. The Applicant has 
provided assurance that sufficient batches have been included in the comparability studies to demonstrate 
comparability across all processes. 
The microbial retention study for the sterile filtration was performed at 2-8°C to mimic the product temperatures 
experienced at beginning of final filtration/filling process of the finished product. The Applicant has committed to 
conduct a microbial retention study at 25°C during the entire duration of the filtration process for confirmation. 
The finished product may contain visible proteinaceous particles. These have been present in the finished 
product formulation since early development and have been observed at all formulation conditions that include 
variations of pH, excipient concentrations and protein concentrations. A number or orthogonal methods 
confirmed the proteinaceous nature of the visible particulates. Data has also been provided which confirm that 
the visible/sub-visible particulates observed after transportation are proteinaceous in nature and are removed 
(visible) or reduced (sub-visible) by the use of an in-line filter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 17/108 
  
  
Furthermore, visible proteinaceous particles have been observed for clinical and validation lots at release and 
stability. During clinical development, over 400 patients were administered finished product batches without the 
use of an in-line filter. In over 2000 subjects treated with reslizumab, regardless of the utilization of in-line filter, 
low-titer anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in 5% asthma patients receiving reslizumab at 3 mg/kg with 
no apparent impact on efficacy or safety.  
In the robustness studies an increase in visual particulates was found when the product is formulated at a 
combination of a slightly higher pH and sodium acetate content. The applicant indicated that acetate level is 
controlled via manufacturing (buffer preparations) and detection controls (pH, conductivity) and data have been 
provided showing that the dispensed amounts are well centred around the target values and that the allowed pH 
ranges and conductivity ranges are met. The Applicant is recommended to evaluate appropriate implementation 
of pH and conductivity as IPC tests for the UF/DF diafiltration buffer and excipient buffer steps.  
The Applicant has committed to developing a method to control the number of visible proteinaceous particles in 
each vial by comparison with vials with spiked bead. Specific acceptance criteria will be developed and will be 
introduced as part of the 100% manual inspection and during appearance testing as part of release and stability 
testing. In the interim period visible proteinaceous particles will be controlled by monitoring particulates using 
the same absorbance method as was done during development.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and in general satisfactory 
documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the active substance as well as the finished product 
can be reproducibly manufactured. The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommended several points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal safety studies with reslizumab were performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
regulations. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The activity of reslizumab has been studied in vitro using IL-5 receptor binding assays, surface plasmon 
resonance (BIAcore) analysis, and by examining IL-5 mediated cell-based response. Additional in vitro studies 
have been performed to characterize the binding of reslizumab to IL-5 and to study reslizumab binding to 
non-targeted tissues and biological substances. In vivo, the biological activity of reslizumab has been measured 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 18/108 
  
  
in monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice using antigen or human IL-5-induced bronchoprovocation as 
methods to induce pulmonary eosinophilia and airway hyper-responsiveness.  
Reslizumab material from early batches produced by Schering was used in almost all pharmacology studies, with 
the exception of study BDR-2014-045-BAR-WC (surface plasmon resonance analysis) and DRR-2013-001 (PD 
effect in transgenic mouse) that were conducted with reslizumab material produced by the Applicant.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro activity and IL-5 binding 
The affinity of the binding to human IL-5 was indistinguishable between reslizumab and its parental antibody 
39D10 (Study D26740). Reslizumab has similar binding affinity for human, monkey and mouse IL-5 
(BDR-2014-045-BAR-WC). The binding affinity of reslizumab in the rat has been demonstrated by surface 
plasmon resonance analysis and revealed a similar affinity of reslizumab for rat IL-5 albeit lower than that for 
human IL-5. 
In vitro tissue cross reactivity 
In human tissue, binding was observed in spinal cord, brain and optic nerve. No binding was seen to peripheral 
nerves, or any other human tissue examined. Similarly, binding of reslizumab was seen in the spinal cord, 
cerebellum, cerebrum, and optic nerve of monkey tissue. The affinity of reslizumab for this antigen in monkeys 
compared to humans is unknown. No binding was seen in corresponding mouse tissues (P6330) or in tissue from 
guinea pig (P6669).  
Further examination of the CNS staining pattern in monkey tissue showed that reslizumab predominately 
stained cerebrum white matter, cerebellum white matter and granular cell layer, and spinal cord white and grey 
matter. Myelinated portions of brain stained most intensely (SN96408). Data from human tissue are more 
limited, but while staining of cerebellum white matter and granular cell layer is seen, this was not seen for the 
trigeminal nerve (SN99372). Binding to the human brain link protein-1 (BRAL-1) is found to be the likely cause 
for the observed staining (D38271). Subsequent studies suggest that this binding to BRAL-1 is an artefact with 
no significant binding of reslizumab to BRAL-1 detected using surface plasmon resonance analysis or 
subsequent orthogonal immunohistochemical staining. 
In vivo pharmacology in asthma models 
Numerous studies in pre-sensitised animal models have been performed to study the effect of reslizumab on 
airway eosinophilia and hyperreactivity induced by allergen challenge.  
Reslizumab (1 mg/kg ip) reduced the increase in eosinophils in broncho-alveolar lung (BAL) fluid observed in a 
pulmonary allergic response in B6D2F1/J mouse significantly, and equivalent to 39D10 (D26555). The effect 
was also confirmed in the mouse strains used for repeat dose toxicity (CD-1, D27201) and carcinogenicity 
testing (transgenic hRAS2, DRR-2013-001). Both the magnitude and the duration of the effect appeared to be 
dose-related. An ip dose of 10 mg/kg reslizumab was shown to inhibit allergic pulmonary eosinophilia in mice for 
up to 8 weeks (D27785).  
In sensitised guinea pig, reslizumab induced a dose dependent reduction of airway eosinophilia and reactivity 
starting at doses of 0.03 mg/kg ip and 1 mg/kg ip, respectively. Complete inhibition of antigen-induced 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 19/108 
  
  
hyperreactivity was produced by 30 mg/kg reslizumab (D27175). Results suggest that the effect may be partly 
mediated by a high dose IgG stabilising effect on mast cells (D27508). Furthermore, the effect of reslizumab in 
guinea pigs appeared to be IL-5 specific (D27630, D27174). The lack of effect of reslizumab on circulating 
lymphocytes or granulocytes in guinea pigs may suggest an advantage compared to peroral treatment with 
corticosteroids (D26956).  
In vivo activity of reslizumab is also demonstrated in NZW rabbit (5 mg/kg iv), the 2nd species used in 
embryofoetal development studies (D27530), and in Cynomolgus monkey (0.3 mg/kg iv) that was used in 
repeat dose toxicity testing (D26751). In monkeys, the duration of reslizumab was extended and detectable 
even after 6 months (D26968). 
Doses shown to have a pharmacological effect in animals are mainly comparable to clinical use (3 mg/kg BW), 
but toxicokinetic data are not available. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Studies limited to investigating the effect of reslizumab in a murine model for allergic conjunctivitis 
(DRR-2013-006) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (Res-4-0002) support that reslizumab selectively affects 
eosinophilic recruitment, without a significant effect on basophils or mast cells.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Reslizumab administered iv at a dose of 100 mg/kg (600 mg/m2) to rats (DS-2014-080) and 25 mg/kg (300 
mg/m2) to monkeys (SN96333) did not elicit effects on the most important parameters related to organ 
functions (cardiovascular, CNS, or gastrointestinal). The doses tested in rats and monkeys are 5.4-fold and 
2.7-fold higher than the proposed human therapeutic dose of 3 mg/kg (111 mg/m2) on a body surface area 
basis, respectively. After iv administration of reslizumab (5 or 25 mg/kg) to monkeys, there was no 
immunohistochemical evidence of binding of reslizumab to CNS tissues and the concentration in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) was <0.1 μg/mL (SN96333). Additionally, macro- and microscopic examinations of a IL-5 knockout 
mice did not identify any differences that may indicate a human concern related to use of reslizumab (D28658). 
There were also no differences detected in a modified Irwin test on IL-5 knockout and IL-5 positive controls 
(D28259). Based on literature data, eosinophils does not appear to be essential in animal immune defence 
against a parasitic infection. 
In a preliminary renal safety pharmacology study, findings of haematuria and increased protein levels in the 
urine were evident following iv administration of 100 mg/kg reslizumab (D27240). In a subsequent study 
(DS-2014-081) reslizumab did not significantly affect urinalysis or urine chemistry parameters suggesting that 
the previously seen haematuria and proteinuria was a consequence of the hypotonic vehicle used in the initial 
formulation. However, an examination of the data from this report shows very high variability in the values for 
one group (Group 1), with a standard deviation that is very similar to the mean value which appears to be the 
result of inclusion of an outlier with a urine volume value and a specific gravity value indicative that this sample 
was contaminated with water.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Reslizumab had an additive effect with oral prednisolone for suppression of BAL fluid eosinophilia in allergic 
B6D2F1/J mice (D26940).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic studies were mainly conducted in the species and strains used during nonclinical safety 
testing (CD-1 mice, NZW rabbits, and Cynomolgus monkeys). In addition, one pharmacokinetic study was 
performed in Sprague Dawley rats. 
Serum and CSF samples were quantified for reslizumab or anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) by the use of one or 
several of the following validated methods:  A biological assay, an ELISA assay, or a Biosensor assay. The 
methods used for detection of anti reslizumab antibodies are however sensitive to the concomitant presence of 
reslizumab, and the usefulness is therefore limited.  
Absorption 
Systemic exposures to reslizumab in serum following single or repeated iv dose administration increased dose 
proportionally or slightly more than dose proportionally, and did not appear to be sex-dependent. The mean 
elimination half-life (t½) observed in most of the nonclinical PK studies generally ranged from approximately 8 
to 18 days after iv administration, and after repeated dosing some accumulation was observed in animals, as 
expected. In humans, the half-life is 24 days. The long half-life is compatible with the proposed dosing regimen 
(every 4 weeks). Generally, a low volume of distribution was observed in mouse, rat and rabbit.  
In the studies where anti-reslizumab antibodies (ADA) were detected, the ADA response correlated with 
decreased serum reslizumab concentrations in some animals, although not all (SN96264 (mouse), 
DS-2009-030, D26751, 96265 (Cynomolgus monkey), SN95457 (NZW rabbit). Epitope mapping indicate that 
the anti-reslizumab antibodies bind to the variable region of reslizumab.  
Distribution 
Absorption data suggest that distribution mainly is limited to the vascular system in both animals and humans. 
Low penetration of the blood-brain barrier (<0.1 μg/mL in CSF) by reslizumab following iv administration of 25 
mg/kg was observed in Study P6670. Specific distribution studies have not been conducted. 
Metabolism 
The metabolic degradation of antibodies is expected to occur via normal proteolytic mechanisms. In line with 
ICH S6, studies on metabolism are not required.  
Excretion 
The lack of specific excretion studies is acceptable since the predicted mechanism of elimination is via 
proteolysis. Relatively low concentrations of reslizumab (~6-8% of corresponding serum concentrations) were 
detected in the milk of lactating mice dosed iv with reslizumab (DS-2010-020). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Published literature indicates that cytokines can be involved regulation of CYP450 enzymes (Mahmood and 
Green, J Clin Pharmacol 2007 Dec; 47 (12) 1540-54). The applicant has conducted an in vitro study in human 
hepatocytes to investigate potential direct cytotoxicity of IL-5 and reslizumab, and to investigate the effect on 
expression of selected CYP450 enzymes (DM-2013-017). Results do not indicate any potential for a significant 
effect on hepatocyte viability, or on CYP450 expression, by reslizumab, or IL-5. Reslizumab is considered to be 
very specific for IL-5, and no further studies with respect to pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential is 
considered necessary.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology program to support this application, was designed in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for the preclinical testing of biologicals (S6 
Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology derived Pharmaceuticals), and includes standard single dose 
studies in mice, rats, and Cynomolgus monkeys; 1- and 6-month repeat-dose iv toxicity studies in mice and 
monkeys; in vitro genetic toxicology tests, an in vivo carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice, a full 
reproductive toxicity evaluation linked to a juvenile toxicity study in mice; a single-dose intrathecal toxicokinetic 
study in monkeys; cross reactivity studies; and local tolerance studies in rats and rabbits. Although the current 
application relates to the iv route of administration, an iv to sc toxicokinetic bridging study was performed in 
monkeys to support ongoing clinical trials by the sc route. 
The majority of the pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in the period 1996-1999, using early batches of 
reslizumab produced by Schering (single and repeat dose toxicity, fertility, embryo-foetal development, local 
tolerance). The peri- and postnatal development with juvenile toxicity study, the 6 month carcinogenicity study 
in transgenic mice, and the iv/sc bridging study were however conducted with reslizumab produced by Ception 
(also used in phase 2 clinical trials).  
Single dose toxicity 
Three GLP-compliant single dose toxicity studies followed by a 14 days observation period have been conducted, 
using mouse, rat and monkey.  The studies and the main findings are summarized in Table 4. Toxicokinetic data 
were not collected in any of the studies.

A 6 month carcinogenicity study with reslizumab in transgenic 001178-T (hemizygous) mice that carries the 
human prototype c-Ha-ras gene was conducted following discussions between Cephalon and FDA in 2010. Based 
on literature data that points to roles for IL-5 and eosinophils in tumour immune surveillance, the FDA 
considered that there was a need for assessment of carcinogenic potential. During the SA procedure in 2014, the 
CHMP agreed that the already conducted study DS-2012-005, previously discussed with the FDA, was adequate 
to describe the overall carcinogenicity potential of reslizumab.

At initiation of dosing, animals were 8-9 weeks old. A total of 14 doses of reslizumab (100, 250 or 516 mg/kg), 
or placebo, were administered iv every 2 weeks during the study. Females given 516 mg/kg/dose were slightly 
more likely to be observed as hunched, thin, or with few faeces relative to the remaining reslizumab and control 
groups. No evidence of reslizumab-related haematopoietic neoplasia was noted. At all reslizumab dose levels, 
reslizumab administration was associated with lower absolute eosinophil, white blood cell and lymphocyte 
count. No reslizumab-related macroscopic or microscopic findings were noted in the pathology examination at 
necropsy. Microscopic findings in animals given the positive control article reflected a robust carcinogenic 
response characterized by the occurrence of numerous neoplasms consistent with the expected effect of 
N-methyl- N-nitrosourea [MNU] in rasH2 mice, and no evidence of reslizumab-related oncogenicity was noted. 
Reproduction Toxicity and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with reslizumab were carried out in CD-1 mice (fertility, 
general reproductive performance, and postnatal development; maternal toxicity, embryo-foetal toxicity, and 
teratogenicity; and, pre- and postnatal development) and NZW rabbits (maternal toxicity, embryo-foetal 
toxicity, and teratogenicity). In addition, a number of F1 generation mouse pups from the pre-/postnatal study 
were administered reslizumab from postnatal (PND) 14 to PND 70 and assessed for effects of the test article on 
systemic toxicity in juvenile mice. Most of the studies were conducted with reslizumab manufactured by 
Schering, with the exception of the pre- and postnatal study where newer batches of reslizumab from Ception 
were used (see discussion in section 2.3.6). Bioactivity of reslizumab in NZW rabbit was confirmed in 
pharmacology studies.

Overall, there were no reslizumab related findings with respect to male or female fertility in mouse, general 
reproductive performance, embryo-foetal development or teratogenicity in mouse and rabbit. There were also 
no findings suggesting an effect on peri- post natal development, or juvenile toxicity, in mouse. In the postnatal 
and juvenile groups endpoints included growth, development, sexual maturation, fertility, reproductive 
performance, behaviour and learning, haematology and clinical chemistry. Reslizumab is excreted into milk in 
mouse, reaching a concentration approximately 6-8% of the concentration in maternal serum.  
Local Tolerance  
The results from four local tolerance studies where reslizumab manufactured by Schering was administered via 
subcutaneous (SN98072), intravenous (SN98568), intramuscular (SN98071) or intraarterial (P6233) route, and 
a pain-on injection study (SN98070) did not show any reslizumab related increase in irritation and pain.  
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity 
Reslizumab is a humanised protein and therefore expected to have antigenic properties in animals, which indeed 
was observed in some animals (formation of antibodies to reslizumab).  
No dedicated studies on immunotoxicity have been conducted. IgG4 does not activate the complement system. 
Impurities 
No dedicated studies on impurities have been conducted.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant claims a waiver for environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies for reslizumab based on the 
following: 
•  Reslizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IL-5 mAb of the IgG4/κ isotype. Proteins are 
biodegradable both in the body and in the environment and are usually excreted from the body after 
endogenous proteolytic degradation. It is the Applicant's opinion that proteins such as reslizumab are 
exempt from the requirement of preparing an Environmental Assessment. 
•  Reslizumab is indicated for a very small population of eosinophilic asthma patients. 
As stated in the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447), antibodies are unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. Based on this, 
the Applicant’s justification for not submitting an ERA for reslizumab is considered acceptable to the CHMP, 
although the size of the patient population in itself is not a ground for waiver. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
IL-5 binding activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies for 
mouse, monkey and rabbit. The binding affinity of reslizumab in the rat, the species in which several safety 
pharmacology studies were performed, has been determined using surface plasmon resonance technology and 
revealed a similar affinity of reslizumab for rat IL-5 albeit lower than that for human IL-5. 
Testing of reslizumab in different animal models on asthma supports a therapeutic potential for reslizumab in 
airway eosinophilic conditions. It is however noted that the effect of reslizumab on eosinophils in circulation has 
not been investigated in any of the non-clinical pharmacology studies included in the dossier. However, the 
applicant refers to literature data pointing to an inhibitory effect of TRFK-5 (rat anti-mouse IL-5) on 
allergen-induced increase in bone marrow eosinophils in mice (Kung et al 1995).  
The observation of binding of reslizumab to human and monkey CNS tissue in vitro resulted in a cause for 
concern related to potential adverse effects. This topic has been further addressed by the applicant by further 
investigations of CNS distribution in vivo, a study with intrathecal administration in monkey, and inclusion of 
neurological endpoints (functional and histopathological) in several in vivo studies in rat and monkey (see safety 
pharmacology and toxicology). Taken together, reslizumab is, due to the high molecular weight, not expected to 
reach CNS in animals or humans with an intact blood brain barrier, and results from different non-clinical studies 
with reslizumab in rodents and monkey do not predict neurotoxicity. The applicant has performed additional 
studies to further investigate the binding of reslizumab to BRAL-1, which was previously identified as the antigen 
to which reslizumab was binding in the CNS tissue. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed no binding of 
reslizumab to recombinant hBRAL-1 and subsequent orthogonal immunohistochemical staining revealed no 
BRAL-1 binding in CNS tissue suggesting that the earlier findings may have been artefacts and that reslizumab 
does not bind with any significant affinity to BRAL-1. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Specific distribution studies have not been conducted. For a monoclocal antibody, distribution studies are in 
general not considered necessary and given that the efficacy of reslizumab is the result of systemic inhibition of 
eosinophil activation, this is appropriate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 28/108 
  
  
General toxicology 
Overall, there were no adverse findings in the single and repeat dose toxicity studies that could be related to 
reslizumab in either species. Also, no CNS-related effects have been revealed during thorough investigations in 
animals. 
The choice of species for general toxicity testing is justified in terms of pharmacological responsiveness.  
In most general toxicity studies, neither toxicity, nor reduction of blood eosinophils, could be detected. 
However, the fully humanised IL-5 IgG1 antibody mepolizumab was reported to induce a > 80% reduction in 
blood eosinophils in monkeys administered repeated monthly doses ≥  5 mg/kg (Hart TK, Cook RM, 
Zia-Amirhosseini P, Minthorn E, Sellers TS, Maleeff BE, Eustis S, Schwartz LW, Tsui P, Appelbaum ER, Martin EC, 
Bugelski PJ, Herzyk DJ, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2001 Aug;108(2):250-7). In theory, the lack of an expected 
pharmacological effect could be due to production of neutralising antibodies developing in response to repeated 
dosing. Indeed, at weeks 13 and 25, a few monkeys in the 6 months study P6749 cleared reslizumab completely 
prior to the next dosing. However, for most animals this was not the case. It is therefore agreed that these 
infrequent cases does not invalidate the results of the studies.  It is also noted that in the studies where a 
pharmacological effect actually was observed, reslizumab manufactured by Ception was used. In the 
pharmacology studies and other repeat dose toxicity studies performed earlier, material from Schering was 
administered. However, when 1 mg/kg Ception material was administered iv every 28 days for 6 months to 
monkeys, no reduction in blood eosinophils could be detected (DS-2009-030), which is consistent with the lack 
of effect on circulating eosinophils noted following iv administration of 1 mg/kg Schering substance every 4 week 
in the standard 6-month toxicity study in monkeys (Study P6749). This comparison supports the fact that there 
is no significant difference in pharmacological activity between reslizumab produced by Schering and Ception. It 
is acknowledged that it may be more difficult to detect a reduction of circulating eosinophils in healthy animals, 
than in BAL fluid in allergic animals, or in patients with elevated eosinophils. In healthy mice and monkeys, an 
inhibitory effect on circulating eosinophils could only be detected in studies where reslizumab was administered 
weekly (Res-4-006), or at high monthly doses (≥ 250 mg/kg, DS-2011-017).In addition, a reduction in blood 
eosinophils was seen in the 6 month carcinogenicity study (monthly iv doses ≥ 250 mg/kg).  
With the exception of the study in juvenile monkeys (Res-4-0006), AUC values have not been calculated in 
monkeys (due to few sampling points).  In these studies, Cmax levels have been used for interspecies 
comparison during assessment. Considering the long half-life of reslizumab, AUC may have been a more 
appropriate parameter for exposure. The interspecies comparison is further complicated by the fact that 
different dosing intervals are compared, and the fact that ADA formation cannot be quantitated in the presence 
of reslizumab. Under these conditions, animal exposure at NOAEL equal to, or slightly in excess, of expected 
human therapeutic exposure must be interpreted cautiously. One exception is however the 1 month study 
DS-2011-017 in 001178 Wild Type mouse, where high doses leading to a reslizumab exposure at least 50 fold 
higher compared to humans resulted in a reduction of eosinophils. 
Genotoxicity 
Reslizumab was assessed for genotoxic potential in two in vitro tests, the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) test in 
Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, and a chromosomal aberration study in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes. In both tests, negative results were reported. 
As outlined in ICH S6 (R1), standardised genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals are not 
considered appropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. The Ames test and chromosomal aberration 
assay conducted by the applicant are considered redundant and do not give any useful information. Monoclonal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 29/108 
  
  
antibodies in general are not considered to entail any potential for interaction with DNA or other chromosomal 
material. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of reslizumab has been tested in a transgenic rasH2 mouse model, in accordance with 
Scientific advice from the FDA. In 2014, the Applicant received support on the adequacy of the study design by 
the CHMP during an EMA scientific advice procedure. 
During the SA, the CHMP advised the Applicant to provide a comprehensive review on the role of IL-5 and 
eosinophils in tumour biology and/or anti-tumour responses. This has been addressed in the submitted 
non-clinical overview. Taken together, there is conflicting evidence on the role of eosinophils and IL-5 in the 
promotion or suppression of tumours, and results seem to depend on the particular model used. Most important, 
no model using IL-5 deficient animals has demonstrated an increased risk of spontaneous tumours. Models in 
experimental systems of induced tumours showed contradictory results and often indicated a protective rather 
than tumour promoting effect in IL-5 deficient mice. 
In conclusion, iv administration of reslizumab to rasH2 hemizygous CByB6F1- Tg(HRAS)2Jic mice at doses up to 
the maximum-feasible dose (516 mg/kg) once every 2 weeks for 26 weeks (14 doses) was well tolerated. No 
evidence of reslizumab-related oncogenicity, mortality, haematopoietic neoplasia, or macroscopic or 
microscopic organ/tissue findings was noted. A pharmacological effect on blood eosinophils was observed, and 
a robust carcinogenic response induced by the positive control agent confirms the model. At the high dose level 
a safety margin of at least 50 compared to the clinical dose (3 mg/kg) can be extrapolated from a different 
toxicology study, which is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In the embryo-foetal development studies in CD-1 mouse and NZW rabbit, toxicokinetic data were not collected, 
and a pharmacological effect has not been demonstrated. IgG antibodies can be transferred from the mother to 
the foetus, but transfer is very low during the first part of the pregnancy. In mouse, little is known concerning 
transfer of human IgG4 specifically, but the FcRn is observed to be present in the yolk sac from GD10-11 
(Christopher J. Bowman, William J. Breslin, Anu V. Connor, Pauline L. Martin, Graeme J.Moffat, Lakshmi 
Sivaraman, M. Belen Tornesi, and Simon Chivers, Birth Defects Research (Part B) 98:459–485 (2013)). This 
may allow transfer of IgG to the foetus relatively earlier in mouse, compared to humans and rabbits. In rabbits, 
the majority of IgG transport from mother to foetus takes place from GD 15 (Pentsuk and van der Laan, Birth 
Defects Research (Part B) 86:328-344 (2009)). For all species, transfer increases during gestation. Given that 
transfer of reslizumab from mother to foetus during the period of organogenesis is expected to be very low in 
humans, the lack of data on actual foetal exposure in the embryofoetal development studies can be accepted. 
Maternal exposure data for mouse can be extrapolated from other studies. The limited PK-information from 
rabbit is considered a deficiency, but not essential for assessment since systemic exposure is assumed after iv 
administration.  
Exposure of the F1 post weaning group in the peri- and post-natal study is expected to occur via transfer from 
mother to foetus during the late part of the pregnancy and/or via milk. Since the first sampling of blood was 
done on PND 14, foetal exposure during pregnancy cannot be quantitated. The reslizumab concentration in milk 
was shown to be 6-8% of the maternal serum concentration. Although the serum exposure in pups was low at 
PND 14, the increase up to PND 21 confirms relevant exposure via milk. This is expected since the mouse is 
known to have a postnatal uptake of IgG via FcRn in the small intestine until weaning. This is in contrast to the 
human situation, where uptake of IgG from milk in neonates only occurs 1-2 days after birth (Pentsuk and van 
der Laan, Birth Defects Research (Part B) 86:328-344 (2009)).

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding have been included as missing information in the RMP. In addition, 
information on pregnancy exposure and breastfeeding is included in the SmPC. 
Juvenile animals were exposed to reslizumab serum concentrations in the clinical range, but there were no 
changes in haematology at the end of the recovery phase. This indicates a lack of pharmacological effects during 
exposure on PND 14, 42 and 70, or that effects were reversible. A conclusion is impossible to draw due to lack 
of haematology samples during the exposure phase. Overall, the comprehensive PPND study that also includes 
exposure of juveniles from PND 14-70, has not revealed any adverse findings on growth and development, 
fertility and reproductive capacity, learning, behaviour, or motor activity. 
Local tolerance 
It is noted that reslizumab batches used in all local tolerance studies, with the exception of P6223, did not 
contain any aggregates.  However, results are in line with data from toxicity studies in mouse and Cynomolgus 
monkey, as well as studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mouse and rabbit. Batches 
used in these studies, and in study P6223, are reported to contain up to 0.2% aggregates at batch release. 
Furthermore, clinical safety data collected for newer reslizumab material produced by Ception and the Applicant 
does not point to local adverse effects in patients. 
Antigenicity and immunotoxicity 
Since reslizumab is a humanised antibody, it is expected that all non-human species may produce anti-drug 
antibodies. ADA formation was only detected in a few animals across repeat dose toxicity studies. However, the 
number of ADA-positive animals may have been underestimated, due to interference of the antibody 
determination with circulating levels of the antigen. The most reliable estimation of the number of animals with 
ADA is therefore from the recovery phases of studies in which the serum levels of reslizumab were near or below 
the LLOQ of the assay.  
An antigenic effect of reslizumab in animals is only considered of relevance for the interpretation of the results 
in non-clinical studies with repeated dosing, and not predictable for potential antigenicity in humans. Humans 
are considered the only relevant and appropriate species for determining antibody responses against 
reslizumab. 
There were no indications of suppressed immune status in general toxicity studies. The Applicant refers to 
literature reports on the role of IL-5 and eosinophils for animal host defence against helminthic parasites. Taken 
together, animal models support a potentially complementary, but not essential role for eosinophils in immune 
defence against helminthic parasites. The lack of dedicated immunotoxicity studies is accepted. See Section 2.6 
for further discussion on this point. 
Impurities 
Changes in manufacturing processes for proteins may affect the pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetics or 
safety profile of the product. No obvious differences between different reslizumab lots used throughout the 
non-clinical program have been established by the applicant. 
No dedicated studies on impurities have been conducted. Given the general lack of systemic pharmacological 
and toxicological effects in mouse and monkey, animal models are not expected to be able to prove minor 
differences between lots with respect to impurities. Further qualifying studies in animals are therefore not 
considered to provide any useful information.

Environmental risk assessment  
As stated in the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447), antibodies are unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. Based on this, 
the Applicant’s justification for not submitting an ERA for reslizumab is considered acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical dossier is in accordance with ICH S6. Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies 
provided adequate evidence of rezlisumab binding activity. The general pharmacology studies support a 
therapeutic potential for reslizumab in airway eosinophilic conditions.  
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, specific distribution studies have not been conducted. For a monoclocal 
antibody, distribution studies are in general not considered necessary and given that the efficacy of reslizumab 
is the result of systemic inhibition of eosinophil activation, this is appropriate.  
Overall, the repeat dose toxicity studies revealed no adverse findings that could be related to reslizumab. Also, 
no CNS-related effects have been revealed during thorough investigations in animals.  
From a non-clinical perspective, the data presented by the Applicant is satisfactory. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The main clinical studies in support of the target populations are two long-term phase 3 placebo-controlled 
studies in patients with eosinophilic asthma with the primary objective to reduce the frequency of clinical asthma 
exacerbations (study 3082 and 3083). One short-term phase 3 trial (study 3081) in patients with eosinophilic 
asthma was designed to assess primarily the impact of two doses of reslizumab on FEV1. Additional studies 
include the open-label long-term safety and efficacy study 3085, a short-term phase 3 study (3084) in patients 
with asthma and unselected for blood eosinophil level and a proof-of-concept phase 2 study (Res-5-0010) in 
patients with eosinophilic asthma.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
After a single i.v. infusion of reslizumab over 20 to 50 minutes, mean peak serum concentrations of 78 µg/ml 
were typically observed either at the end of the infusion or at the next time point after the end of the infusion. 
Serum reslizumab concentrations generally decline from peak in a biphasic manner. Reslizumab 
pharmacokinetics in healthy adults and patients does not appear to be different to a relevant extent. 
No apparent deviation from dose-proportional reslizumab PK was noted over the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 3.0 
mg/kg. Lineair PK in this dose range was observed probably due to aspecific non-target mediated clearance. 
Upon multiple dose administration of reslizumab, the serum concentration-time curves were qualitatively similar 
to that observed after a single dose, with accumulation of approximately 1.5 to 1.9 fold. This observed degree 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 34/108 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of accumulation for reslizumab is in line with the expected accumulation considering an elimination half-life of 
approximately 24 days and dosing every 28 days (4 weeks). 
Inter-individual variability following multiple doses was approximately 20% to 30% for both Cmax and AUC. 
Distribution 
As expected for a monoclonal antibody, reslizumab has a small volume of distribution (approximately 5 L for a 
typical patient), suggesting minimal distribution to the extravascular tissues. 
Elimination 
The CL estimate from the final PopPK model was 7.16 mL/h for the typical patient (an individual weighing 73 kg, 
representing the median body weight in the analysis dataset population). Reslizumab has a long terminal t½ of 
approximately 24 days. Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, reslizumab is believed to be degraded by 
enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. 
Low albumin serum levels have been reported to result in increased clearance of monoclonal antibodies.  The 
Applicant investigated the effect of albumin on the PK of reslizumab, however, no data were available for low 
albumin levels (<3.5 g/dl). No data were available for IL-5 levels, and as such, IL-5 levels could not be evaluated 
as a covariate in the popPK model. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Interindividual variability of reslizumab pharmacokinetics under steady state conditions is small to moderate, 
between 20 and 30%. 
Special populations 
Reslizumab is an antibody with a molecular mass of 147 kDa and is therefore not expected to be excreted in 
urine. Further, no direct effect of hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is expected either 
because antibodies are principally cleared by catabolism. The expected lack of effect of mild renal or hepatic 
impairment is confirmed by the PopPK analysis. With respect to renal function, in the PopPK analysis, the 
majority of individuals had either normal renal function (36.6%) or mildly decreased renal function (55.5%). A 
small proportion (7.9%) had moderately decreased renal function and only 1 subject (<1%) had severely 
decreased renal function. Renal function was assessed using an estimate of glomerular filtration rate based on 
a Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of 
severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab. With respect to hepatic impairment, in the 
PopPK analysis, the majority of the population (95.3%, n=766) exhibited normal liver function tests at baseline, 
4% (n=35) exhibited mildly increased and 0.4% (n=3) moderately increased liver function tests. The results 
indicate that exposures are generally consistent across the liver function test groups, although exposure values 
increased slightly in patients with mild elevated liver function tests. Liver function was assessed using the 
National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group Liver Function Classification, in which classification 
of liver dysfunction is based on a combination of total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase. There were 
insufficient data to assess the impact of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab. 
No further formal studies in patients with renal and hepatic impairment are considered necessary. 
Results of the PopPK analysis demonstrated that age, gender, race (Caucasian, Black, Asian), have no notable 
impact on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab. No marked differences in reslizumab exposure were observed 
between adults and older subjects.

Table 7 Age Categories (≥65 years) in Reslizumab Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PopPK analysis also demonstrated no clearly reduced exposure to reslizumab in patients who developed 
antibodies to reslizumab (i.e. were ADA positive).  
No data in children are currently provided. Data in adolescents from PopPK study CP-11-006 suggest a slightly 
lower exposure in adolescents when dosed with 3 mg/kg. 
PopPK analyses indicated that heavier body weight results in more rapid clearance and larger volume of 
distribution, potentially resulting in reduced exposure at higher weight when flat dosing would be applied. 
Exposure data upon weight-based dosing (3 mg/kg) suggests that the proposed weight-based posology yields 
relatively comparable exposure at all weight ranges. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with reslizumab.  In vitro data (Study 
DM-2013-017) indicate that IL-5 and reslizumab are unlikely to affect CYP1A2, 3A4 or 2B6 activity.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Reslizumab binds to human interleukin 5 (IL-5), a key cytokine responsible for the differentiation, maturation, 
recruitment, and activation of human eosinophils. IL-5 is the most potent and specific cytokine for the eosinophil 
lineage and is responsible for cellular expansion, release from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood, and 
survival following a variety of triggers, typically TH2 stimuli. 
By targeting IL-5, reslizumab prevents IL-5 from binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex 
expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits IL-5 signalling and the over-expression of peripheral 
blood and tissue eosinophils. Neutralizing IL-5 reduces the promotion, growth and survival of eosinophils, 
although complete blood eosinopenia is not achieved due to redundant signalling by IL-3 and GM-CSF through 
a common β-sub-unit. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PK/PD analyses were provided in order to investigate potential dose-response and exposure response 
relationships, in support of the current application. 
Based on the PK/PD analyses provided, the proposed 3 mg/kg dosing regimen is anticipated to produce near 
maximal inhibition of the eosinophil response. The model predicted decrease in eosinophil counts with this 
dosing regimen corresponds with a dose dependent increase in predicted FEV1. Improvement in FEV1 appeared 
to be more pronounced as exposure increases. A corresponding decrease in model predicted ACQ values is 
observed with increase in dose. As systemic exposure to reslizumab increases, the ACQ score decreases. These 
findings confirm that the observed exposure related changes in eosinophil levels and FEV1 are associated with 
an exposure-related improvement in symptoms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 36/108 
  
  
 
 
Though Imax and IC50 for peripheral blood eosinophilia seem to occur at blood reslizumab below the ones 
expected at the proposed therapeutic dose, it is clear that administration of reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) causes a 
reduction in blood eosinophils, which in turn is correlated with clinical benefit (i.e. improvement in FEV1 and ACQ 
scores, see section ‘Dose-response studies and main clinical studies’). This supports the correlation between 
peripheral blood eosinophil count and clinical benefit. 
Reslizumab being a large molecule is considered to have a low risk for QT-mediated proarrhythmia. In Study 
C38072/1102, triplicate ECGs were collected at each pharmacokinetic time point and were compared to 
baseline. There was no apparent trend toward an increase in QTcF with an increase in the serum concentration 
of reslizumab. Overall, values of mean increases of QTcF were minimal and without indication of a relationship 
to increasing dose, expected time of maximal concentration, or increasing duration of exposure to reslizumab. 
As a result, repeat iv doses of up to 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab are considered to have minimal potential to cause 
cardiac repolarization changes. In Study C38072/1102, no ECG findings were reported as adverse events and no 
abnormal ECG findings were assessed as clinically significant by the investigators. 
Myalgia was determined to be an adverse drug reaction for the proposed reslizumab dose (3 mg/kg) and 
regimen (every 4 weeks), based on an incidence slightly greater than placebo in controlled trials and clinical 
plausibility. Therefore, an exploration of the relationship between reslizumab exposure across a broad series of 
muscle disorder adverse event codes was conducted. An exposure-response correlation was observed with the 
model predicted probability of experiencing a muscle disorder adverse event increasing with increase in 
model-predicted reslizumab concentration. 
No apparent differences in reslizumab pharmacodynamics were observed between Japanese and non-Japanese 
subjects. The Applicant discussed the possibility for relevant genetic differences related to IL-5 in different 
ethnic populations. All missense variants characterized in IL-5 are rare or very rare across European, East Asian, 
South Asian, African, and Latino. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics or reslizumab has been investigated to a reasonable extent. In general, pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of reslizumab are in line with those for other monoclonal antibodies, i.e., a small volume of 
distribution and a long elimination half-life was observed. 
Results of the PopPK analysis demonstrated that age, gender, race (Caucasian, Black, Asian), have no notable 
impact on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab. 
No data in children are currently provided. Data in adolescents from PopPK study CP-11-006 suggest a slightly 
lower exposure in adolescents when dosed with 3 mg/kg. A PIP has been agreed in order to obtain data in the 
paediatric population between 6 and 18 years of age. 
Exposure data upon weight-based dosing (3 mg/kg) suggests that the proposed posology yields relatively 
comparable exposure at all weight ranges. Additional analyses provided by the Applicant indicated that this 
relationship holds up to obese patients. Therefore, there is no need for capping of the dose at a certain weight. 
Antibodies have a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they are not metabolised by liver 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) or other drug metabolizing enzymes. Further, and it is unlikely that they have an effect 
on CYPs or other metabolizing enzymes in terms of inhibition or induction. This presumed lack of relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 37/108 
  
  
drug-drug interactions is confirmed by the exploratory in vitro data and PopPK analyses conducted by the 
Applicant. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
However, reslizumab has not been studied in patients concurrently taking immunosuppressant medicinal 
products other than oral corticosteroids; therefore, the safety and efficacy profile of reslizumab in these patients 
is unknown. Use in combination with immunosuppressant drugs therapy is included as missing information in 
the RMP. This information is also reflected in the SmPC. 
In addition, the SmPC states that reslizumab has not been studied in patients receiving live vaccines. No data 
are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients 
receiving reslizumab or the response to new immunisations in patients receiving reslizumab. Effect on 
vaccination and the use of live/attenuated vaccines has been added as missing information in the RMP. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action is through blockage of the IL-5 receptor by reslizumab. Reslizumab occupies a region 
on human IL-5 that is essential for its interaction with the receptor and thereby blocks IL-5 bioactivity. 
Based on the PK/PD analyses provided, the proposed 3 mg/kg dosing regimen is anticipated to produce near 
maximal inhibition of the eosinophil response. 
PK/PD analyses further indicate that there is no apparent trend toward an increase in QTcF with increasing 
serum concentrations of reslizumab. The modelled probability of experiencing a muscle disorder adverse event 
increases with increasing reslizumab concentration. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Reslizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG4, κ) against the human interleukin-5 (IL 5). Reslizumab 
binds specifically to IL 5 and interferes with IL 5 binding to its cell surface receptor. IL 5 is a key cytokine 
responsible for the differentiation, maturation, recruitment and activation of human eosinophils. Reslizumab 
binds human IL 5 with picomolar affinity blocking its biological function; consequently survival and activity of 
eosinophils are reduced. 
Pharmacokinetics or reslizumab has been investigated to a reasonable extent. In general, pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of reslizumab are in line with those for other monoclonal antibodies, i.e., a small volume of 
distribution and a long elimination half-life was observed.

Study 3081 
A 16-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Reslizumab (0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg) as Treatment for Patients (12-75 Years of Age) with Eosinophilic 
Asthma. 
Assessment report

Methods 
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether reslizumab, at a dosage of 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg 
administered once every 4 weeks for a total of 4 doses, was more effective than placebo in improving lung 
function in patients with eosinophilic asthma as assessed by the overall change from baseline in forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). 
Adult patients (aged 12- 75 years) with a previous diagnosis of asthma were included. Other main inclusion 
criteria were an ACQ score of at least 1.5, airway reversibility of at least 12% after beta-agonist administration, 
current blood eosinophil level of at least 400/µL and inhaled fluticasone at a dosage of at least 440 mcg, or 
equivalent, daily. Patients’ baseline asthma therapy regimen must have been stable for 30 days before 
screening, and continued without dosage changes throughout the study.  
The main exclusion criteria were known hypereosinophilic syndrome, other lung conditions (including a.o. 
COPD, Churg-Strauss syndrome), current smoker (smoked within the past 6 months), other systemic 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies, use of other biologic agents, comorbidity that could 
interfere with the study or compromise patients’ safety, uncontrolled comorbidity, history of concurrent 
immunodeficiency (a.o. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), 
current use of systemic corticosteroids (including use of oral corticosteroids), infections (including parasitic 
infection). 
The study consisted of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 16-week double-blind treatment period, including a 
final evaluation 4-weeks after the final infusion (end-of-treatment visit), and an end-of-study visit that occurred 
90 (±7) days after the end-of-treatment visit. Thereafter, patients could enrol the open-label, long-term study 
or return for an assessment 90 (±7) days after their end-of-treatment visit in this study. 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to study drug treatment (reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg, reslizumab 3.0 
mg/kg, or placebo) with a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified according to the occurrence of previous 
asthma exacerbations within the past 12 months (yes or no) and age (12 to 17 years or 18 years of age or older) 
at baseline. An asthma exacerbation was defined by 1 of the following: 1) a reduction in FEV1 of 20% or greater, 
2) a hospitalization because of asthma, 3) emergency treatment because of asthma, or 4) use of prednisone or 
systemic corticosteroids for 3 days or more. 
The primary efficacy variable was the overall change from baseline in FEV1 over 16 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary efficacy variables were change from baseline over 16 weeks for ACQ score, FVC, FEF25%-75%, ASUI 
score, SABA use, blood eosinophil count, and % predicted FEV1. Change in AQLQ score from baseline to week 
16 was also included as a secondary endpoint. Further, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety and 
tolerability were evaluated. 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS (all randomized patients who were treated with at least 1 dose 
of study drug). The primary variable was analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with fixed effects (treatment, stratification factors, sex, visit, interaction of treatment and visit), covariates 
(height, baseline value), and patient as the random effect for the repeated measurements. The overall 
treatment effect was analysed using a 2-sided t test at the significance level of 0.05. A hierarchical testing 
procedure (in the order of 3.0 mg/kg first) was used to control the Type I error for the 2 comparisons of 
reslizumab to placebo.  
Results 
A total of 315 were enrolled in the study and 311 received at least 1 dose of study drug (placebo: n=105, 
Reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg: n=103; Reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg: n=103). A total of 81%, 88%, and 83% of patients

completed the study for the placebo, 0.3 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg treatment group. Post-hoc analyses showed that 
most patients were classified as GINA step 4 (79%), followed by GINA step 3 (17%) and <1% as GINA step 5. 
A total of 50 out of 311 (16%) patients withdrew from the study; (12 [12%] receiving 0.3 mg/kg reslizumab 
treatment, 18 [17%] receiving 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab treatment, and 20 [19%] receiving placebo treatment). 
The most frequent reason for withdrawal was adverse events, which occurred for 1 (<1%) patients in the 0.3 
mg/kg reslizumab treatment group, 7 (7%) patients in the 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab treatment group, and 9 (9%) 
patients in the placebo treatment group.  
Baseline demographic and disease state characteristics were generally similar between patients in each 
treatment group. The mean age was 43.9 years, 58% were female, 81% were white and mean weight was 
76.2kg. The overall randomized population had a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 70.1%, AQLQ score of 4.349 
and ACQ score of 2.514. About 56% of the patients experienced an exacerbation of asthma within the past 12 
months and most patients (78%) used LABA in addition to ICS. The mean daily dosage for inhaled 
corticosteroids at baseline was 756.7 µg (range 320 - 2400), 756.3 µg (range: 320 – 1800) and 813.5 µg (range: 
400 – 3400) in the placebo, reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group, respectively. 
About 87% of patients used a long-acting beta-agonist, in addition to the required ICS (randomised population). 
Comparable results were obtained for the FAS. 
The overall change from baseline (LS mean) in FEV1 over 16 weeks was 0.126 L, 0.242 L, and 0.286 L for the 
patients in the placebo, 0.3 mg/kg reslizumab, and 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab treatment groups, respectively.  
Both doses showed a statistical significant improvement in FEV1 compared to placebo; the treatment difference 
was 0.160 L (95%CI: 0.060-0.259) and 0.115 L (95%CI: 0.016-0.215) for reslizumab 3 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, 
respectively (Table 11). Improvements were seen after the first dose and were sustained through 16 weeks.  
The statistically significant improvement in FEV1 was confirmed for the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group with other 
measures of pulmonary function, including FVC, FEF25%-75%, and % predicted FEV1 (latter not shown) (Table 
12) No treatment effect on FVC and FEF25%-75% was observed for patients in the reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg 
treatment group.  
Improvements in ACQ, AQLQ, and ASUI scores, decreases in frequency of SABA use, and decreases in blood 
eosinophils were also seen for patients in the reslizumab treatment groups.  
Except for asthma symptom score and SABA use, the changes from baseline in each of these endpoints were 
more consistent and larger for the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group compared with the reslizumab 0.3 
mg/kg treatment group.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 3082: A 12-Month, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) in the Reduction of Clinical Asthma Exacerbations in 
Patients (12-75 Years of Age) With Eosinophilic Asthma. 
Study 3083: A 12-Month, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) in the Reduction of Clinical Asthma Exacerbations in 
Patients (12-75 Years of Age) With Eosinophilic Asthma. 
The Applicant submitted two pivotal phase 3 studies (study 3082 and 3083) with identical design and objectives. 
This approach was previously discussed and agreed during scientific advice. 
The studies consisted of a 2- to 4-week screening period and a 52-week treatment period, including a final 
evaluation at week 52 (end-of-treatment visit; 4 weeks after the final infusion at week 48). After the 
end-of-treatment visit, patients either enrolled in an available open-label, long-term study or returned for a 
follow-up assessment 90 (±7) days after the end-of-treatment visit. Both studies were multicentre studies 
conducted in the EU, US and Asian-Pacific region. 
Methods and results are therefore presented combined.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
Adult patients (aged 12- 75 years) with a previous diagnosis of asthma were included. The patient had at least 
1 asthma exacerbation requiring oral, intramuscular, or intravenous corticosteroid use for at least 3 days over 
the past 12 months before screening. Other main inclusion criteria were an ACQ score of at least 1.5, airway 
reversibility of at least 12% after beta-agonist administration, current blood eosinophil level of at least 400/µL 
and inhaled fluticasone at a dosage of at least 440 mcg, or equivalent, daily. Chronic oral corticosteroid use (no 
more than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) was allowed. Patients’ baseline asthma therapy regimen must 
have been stable for 30 days before screening, and continued without dosage changes throughout the study.

The main exclusion criteria were known hypereosinophilic syndrome, other lung conditions (including a.o. 
COPD, Churg-Strauss syndrome), current smoker, other systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating 
therapies, use of other biologic agents, comorbidity that could interfere with the study or compromise patients’ 
safety, uncontrolled comorbidity, history of concurrent immunodeficiency (a.o. human immunodeficiency virus 
[HIV] or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), infections within a predefined period (parasitic infection, 
infections requiring hospitalization or antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to screening, water-borne parasites), 
asthma exacerbation within 4 weeks of screening or during screening period. 
Treatments 
Investigational Product: Reslizumab was provided as a sterile solution for infusion presented as 100 mg (10 mL) 
per vial, formulated at 10 mg/mL in sodium acetate, sucrose. 
Placebo: Placebo was provided as a sterile solution for infusion presented as 10 mL per vial, formulated in 
sodium acetate, sucrose, and was used in a manner identical to that of reslizumab. 
Patients were administered intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes reslizumab at a dosage of 3.0 mg/kg or placebo 
at baseline and once every 4 weeks relative to baseline over 48 weeks. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of reslizumab, at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg administered 
intravenously every 4 weeks over 12 months, as assessed by the reduction in frequency of clinical asthma 
exacerbations (CAEs) during 12 months. Secondary objectives were to demonstrate the efficacy of reslizumab 
based on overall change in FEV1 over 16 weeks and change to week 16, overall change in Asthma Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (AQLQ) over 16 weeks and change to week 16, time to first CAE, overall change in Asthma 
symptom utility index (ASUI) over 16 weeks, overall change in use of short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) over 16 
weeks and overall change in blood eosinophil count over 16 and 52 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the frequency of CAEs per patient over 52 weeks. An asthma exacerbation as defined 
as a worsening of asthma that required the following medical intervention: 
• 
• 
use of systemic, or an increase in the use of inhaled, corticosteroid treatment for 3 or more days; for 
patients already being treated with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids, the dose of corticosteroids 
needed to be increased 2 or more fold for at least 3 or more days. 
asthma-related emergency treatment including at least 1 of the following:  
o  an unscheduled visit to the physician’s office for nebulizer treatment or other urgent treatment 
to prevent worsening of asthma symptoms, (2) a visit to the emergency room for 
asthma-related treatment, (3) an asthma-related hospitalization 
The above criteria had to be corroborated with at least 1 other measurement to indicate worsening in the clinical 
signs and symptoms of asthma, as follows: 
• 
• 
decrease in FEV1 by 20% or more from baseline 
decrease in the PEFR by 30% or more from baseline on 2 consecutive days 
•  worsening of symptoms or other clinical signs per physician evaluation of the event 
Secondary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 43/108 
  
  
•  Change from baseline to week 16 in FEV1 
•  Overall change from baseline in FEV1 over 16 weeks 
•  Change from baseline in AQLQ score to week 16 
•  Overall change from baseline in ACQ score over 16 weeks 
• 
Time to 1st CAE 
•  Overall change from baseline in ASUI score over 16 weeks 
•  Overall change from baseline in short-acting beta-agonist use over 16 weeks 
•  Overall change from baseline in blood eosinophil count over 16 weeks and 52 weeks 
Further, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety and tolerability were evaluated. Adverse events of 
special interest were adverse events related to 1.asthma exacerbation, 2. the administration route or potential 
safety issues with this class of medications (related to study drug infusion, hypersensitivity reactions, 
malignancies, adverse events in patients with anti-drug antibodies) and 3. Identified after medical review phase 
3 safety studies: increase in serum creatine phosphokinase.  
Sample size 
For the study 3082, 480 patients (240 patients per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled. 
For the study 3083, 460 patients (230 patients per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
All patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, either 3.0 mg/kg of reslizumab or placebo, 
using Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomization was stratified by oral corticosteroid use (yes or 
no) at study enrolment and by region (US or other). Study drug was administered by intravenous infusion once 
every 4 weeks (±7 days) relative to baseline for a total of 13 doses (48 weeks). Patients and investigators 
remained blinded to treatment assignment during the study. Because of the expected effect of reslizumab on 
blood eosinophil count, eosinophil count data were redacted from hematology results during the treatment 
period. In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study were also blinded to the study drug 
identity until the database was locked for analysis and the treatment assignment revealed.  
The set of randomized patients (assigned to a treatment group regardless of whether or not patients received 
any study drug) was used for all study population summaries and efficacy analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to reslizumab or matching placebo (1:1 ratio) via 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) at the baseline visit. In order to maintain the blind, each patient received 
a specific volume of reslizumab or placebo solution determined by the patient’s body weight. 
Randomization was stratified by oral corticosteroid use (yes or no) at study enrolment and by region (United 
States [US] or other).

Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Randomised set: All patients who were randomly assigned to a treatment group at enrolment, regardless of 
whether or not a patient received any study drug. The set of randomized patients was used for all study 
population summaries and efficacy analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Safety analysis set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  The safety analysis set was used for 
all safety analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Full analysis set (FAS): includes all randomized patients who were treated with at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Data from assessments of pulmonary function, SABA use, and the ACQ, AQLQ, and ASUI at a scheduled visit 
were excluded from the FAS if the assessments were preceded by usage within 7 days of a limited subset of 
medications that could significantly confound interpretation of the efficacy parameters at the visit. These 
medications included the addition of a long-acting beta-agonist, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, or an oral 
or systemic corticosteroid, if not taken at baseline. If taken at baseline, an increase in a chronic, maintenance 
dose of the oral or systemic corticosteroid was included. 
The FEV1 subpopulation analysis set includes all patients in the FAS with % predicted FEV1 ≤85% at baseline. 
Statistical analyses 
Primary endpoint – Frequency of clinical asthma exacerbations 
Clinical asthma exacerbations that occurred between the completion of the first dose of study drug and 2 weeks 
after the end of treatment (week 52 or early withdrawal visit) were counted towards the CAEs for analysis. The 
frequency of CAEs was analysed using the generalized linear model (GLM) for data from the negative binomial 
distributions that is commonly referred to as the negative binomial (NB) regression model. The primary NB 
model included the treatment group and randomization stratification factors (baseline usage of oral 
corticosteroid [yes or no] and geographical region [US or other]) as model factors and the logarithm of follow up 
time excluding the summed duration of CAE events as an offset variable. This offset variable adjusted the CAE 
rate for total duration of patient exposure to study drug when not experiencing a CAE. The ratio of CAE rate 
between the treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated from the NB model. 
Treatment effect was tested using the likelihood based Chi-square test at the 0.05 significance level. The 
primary analysis of CAEs was based on the adjudicated data. 
Sensitivity analyses primary endpoint: A low dropout rate in this study was anticipated (<5%) because all 
patients maintained their background therapies throughout the study. The primary analysis model was unbiased 
if the missing data mechanism appeared to be random. To assess the robustness of the primary NB model, a 
sensitivity analysis was performed using a multiple imputation procedure for missing data (Little and Rubin 
2002). This analysis imputed values for CAE and exposure for patients who withdrew early from treatment. 
Imputation was done separately for patients considered as Missing at Random (MAR) (i.e., for reasons other 
than asthma exacerbation and lack of efficacy: imputation from the same stratum and treatment group) and for 
patients Missing Not at Random (MNAR) (i.e., for asthma exacerbation and lack of efficacy: imputation is drawn 
from placebo patient within the same stratum). 
The primary analysis was also repeated using an offset that did not exclude the summed duration of 
exacerbations from the follow-up time in the offset calculation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 45/108 
  
  
Secondary analyses of the primary efficacy variable included the frequency of CAEs requiring courses of oral or 
systemic corticosteroids (oral or parenteral) prescribed for 3 or more days. The frequency of asthma 
exacerbations resulting in hospitalization or a visit to the emergency room was also analysed. These variables 
were analysed similarly to the primary efficacy variable. The frequency of asthma exacerbations as recorded by 
the investigator on the CAE eCRF page, ie, non-adjudicated CAEs, was also analysed. 
Secondary and other efficacy variable analyses 
Secondary endpoints were analysed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment 
group, visit, treatment and visit interaction, and stratification factors as fixed effects and patient as a random 
effect. Covariates for baseline values were also included in the model; for pulmonary function test analyses, 
covariates for height and sex were included as well. 
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate and compare the distributions of time to CAE between 
reslizumab and placebo. The hazard ratio and p-value were estimated using the stratified Cox regression model. 
Analysis of the change from baseline to endpoint in pulmonary function tests was performed using an analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for treatment, oral corticosteroids use at enrolment (yes or 
no), region (US or other), sex, and covariates for height and baseline value. Analysis of the change in AQLQ 
score from baseline to endpoint was performed using the same ANCOVA model as for pulmonary function tests 
with the exception of inclusion of sex and height in the model. The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was 
used to analyse the proportion of patients achieving at least a 0.5 reduction from baseline in ACQ score and the 
proportion of patients achieving at least a 0.5 improvement from baseline in AQLQ score. 
Multiple comparisons and multiplicity 
A pre-specified, fixed sequence multiple testing procedure was implemented to test the primary and secondary 
efficacy variables while controlling the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. At the point where p>0.05, no further 
comparisons were interpreted inferentially. 
Results of testing the frequency of CAEs specifically requiring systemic corticosteroids could be interpreted 
inferentially at an alpha level of 0.05 provided that results of all tests for secondary variables were significant.  
No multiplicity adjustments were made for other efficacy variable and exploratory efficacy variable analyses. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Most randomised patients completed the studies (86%-89%) (Table 13). Reasons for withdrawal were 
comparable between treatment groups; the main reason being withdrawal of consent. Withdrawal due to 
adverse events was low (2%-4%).

Conduct of the study 
About one-fourth of the patients reported at least 1 protocol violation, no markedly differences were seen 
between treatment groups. The most commonly reported violations were related to inclusion criteria (ACQ score 
less than 1.5) and GCP guidelines (e.g. signing wrong version IC, reporting serious AE beyond pre-defined time 
period, or physical exam categories not documented). Most patients remained in the study based on the decision 
of the sponsor. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 14. Treatment groups were balanced with regard to age 
(mean: 47 years), sex, (42% male) and race (73% white).

The number of adolescents and elderly included is limited (about 5%). Only few patients were included in the 
age group 12-17 yrs (n=11 on placebo and n=14 on reslizumab) which precludes a meaningful interpretation

and adolescents are currently not included in the indication. The number of elderly patients was limited (≥ 65 
years: n=87) as can be expected for an asthmatic population.  
Patients were stratified for US and OCS use at baseline. A total of 15% and 7% of the patients were enrolled in 
the US for studies 3082 and 3083, respectively, whereas 35.6% and 59.7% were enrolled in the EU. According 
to IVRS (used for analyses), 19% and 12% of patients used OCS at enrolment for studies 3082 and 3083. These 
numbers were somewhat lower based on CRF; 13% and 9%, respectively. 
Disease state characteristics, including asthma exacerbation frequency, airway reversibility, FEV1, were 
generally similar between the 2 treatment groups at baseline for both studies (Table 15). Patients were 
inadequately controlled as demonstrated by a mean ACQ score of 2.7 and 2.6 points at baseline and FEV1 % 
predicted of 64.3% and 69.2% in studies 3082 and 3083, respectively. The mean number of prior asthma 
exacerbations was 2. Within study 3082, patients were receiving inhaled corticosteroids at baseline at a mean 
dose of 836 µg per day, approximately 15% were receiving concomitant low-dose oral corticosteroids, and more 
than 85% were receiving concomitant long-acting beta-agonist therapy. Within study 3083, patients were 
receiving inhaled corticosteroids at baseline at a mean dose of 806 µg per day. At least 82% of randomized 
patients in either treatment group used long-acting beta-agonists at baseline and about 12% used oral 
corticosteroids.

Numbers analysed 
For study 3082 data from 489 patients were analyzed for efficacy and data from 488 patients were analyzed for 
safety. 
For study 3083 from 464 patients were analyzed for efficacy and data from 464 patients were analyzed for 
safety. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The mean duration of the treatment phase was about 340 days for both studies. About 78%-83% of patients 
received ≥13 complete infusions. 
The primary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in CAE frequency for patients in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group compared with placebo (Table 16). The reslizumab versus placebo CAE rate ratio 
(95% CI) was 0.5010 (95% CI: 0.3726, 0.6737; p<0.0001) and 0.4063 (95% CI: 0.2819, 0.5855; p<0.0001) 
for studies 3082 and 3083, respectively. These data indicate a 50% - 59% reduction in adjudicated CAE events 
per patient year by reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg. Sensitivity analyses showed comparable results.  
The most common medical intervention for a CAE in the placebo and reslizumab groups was treatment with an 
oral systemic corticosteroid which also showed a statistical significant difference with placebo. Number of 
patients with a hospitalization or emergency visits was limited (between 4%-9% across both studies) and the 
difference with placebo was not statistically significant.

a This treatment group comparison was controlled for Type I error. 
CAE=clinical asthma exacerbation; CI=confidence interval; ER=emergency room; SD=standard deviation. 
Notes: The CAEs counted were those that occurred between the completion of the first dose of study drug and 2 weeks after 
the end EOT/early withdrawal visit. Adjusted CAE rates and CIs, CAE rate ratios and CIs, and p-values were based on NB 
regression model adjusted for stratification factors (baseline usage of OCS [yes or no] and geographical region [US or other]). 
The median time to first CAE could not be estimated for the reslizumab treatment group in either study because 
less than 50% of patients in that group experienced a CAE. The KM estimates of probability of not experiencing 
a CAE by week 52 were higher in patients receiving reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg than in patients receiving placebo in 
Studies 3082 (61.3% vs 44.2%) and 3083 (73.2% vs 51.9%). Furthermore, as demonstrated by the hazard 
ratio, the likelihood of experiencing a CAE at any time during the 52-week treatment period for patients in the 
reslizumab treatment group was reduced by 42.5% (p<0.0001) in study 3082, and 51.4% (p<0.0001) in study 
3083.  
A summary of the secondary efficacy endpoints is shown in  
Table 17.  
Efficacy was seen at the first time point and sustained over time. No significant effect was seen on use of short 
acting beta-agonist therapy over 16 weeks. Treatment effects on FEV1 increase were observed at the first 
observation period of 4 weeks and were sustained throughout the study. There was a statistically significant 
improvement compared to placebo; the treatment difference was 0.126 L and 0.093 L, respectively. Statistical 
significant improvements were also seen for other measures of asthma control based on the overall score 
(AQLQ, ACQ and ASUI). At the same time, the proportion of responders (minimal of ≥0.5 point improvement 
ACQ or AQLQ) was increased compared to placebo. For instance, the proportion of ACQ responders in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups was 77% and 64% (p=0.0022) at week 52, respectively in study 
3082. Corresponding data for study 3083 were 81% and 62% (p=<0.0001) at week 52 in the reslizumab and 
placebo group, respectively.

Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy data from the main studies were pooled for the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg groups. The 
Integrated 16-Week Population included data up to 16 weeks from all 3 placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (i.e., 
Studies 3081, 3082, and 3083) and was utilized to evaluate short-term asthma control (e.g., FEV1, ACQ). The 
Integrated 52-Week Population included data through 52 weeks from the two 52-week placebo-controlled Phase 
3 studies (ie, Studies 3082 and 3083) and was utilized primarily to evaluate future asthma risk (i.e. CAEs).  
The 52-week integrated population was also used to evaluate the influence of intrinsic patient factors and of 
factors extrinsic to the patient. Data from the integrated 52-week population are shown here.  
The demographics were generally similar between the studies (Table 18).

Results of the pooled analysis demonstrate that reslizumab reduced the rates of CAEs over 52 weeks, CAEs 
requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment for ≥3 days, and CAEs requiring hospitalization or a visit to the ER 
in each of the individual studies; the latter not reaching statistical significance (Table 19). 
In the Integrated 52-Week Population, reslizumab-treated patients saw a 54% reduction in the CAE rate 
compared with placebo-treated patients (CAE rate ratio [95% CI]=0.4613 [0.3662, 0.5811], p<0.0001).

3083 and integrated 52-week population, Randomized set). 
CAE=clinical asthma exacerbation; CI=confidence interval; ER=emergency room; OCS=oral corticosteroid 
The results for the secondary endpoints based on the integrated week 52 population are shown in Table 20. The 
overall improvement in FEV1 is 117 ml over 16 weeks. The data on FEV1 and other symptomatic endpoints are 
consistent with the individual results. The improvements sustain over 52 weeks.

Blood eosinophil level after discontinuation 
Decreases in blood eosinophil counts were seen with reslizumab 3 mg/kg following the first dose and maintained 
through 52 weeks of treatment with no signs of tachyphylaxis.

Within the limited subset of patients who discontinued treatment and had a follow-up visit approximately 4 
months after the last dose showed recrudescence of blood eosinophil counts. This is consistent with the 
prolonged half-life of reslizumab (24 to 30 days). 
Subgroup analyses – Clinical asthma exacerbations 
The frequency of CAEs over 52 weeks in the Integrated 52-Week Population was analyzed by age group, sex, 
race, geographical region, ADA results, OCS use at baseline, LABA use at baseline, and LTRA use at baseline 
(Table 22). Favourable results were seen for all subgroups except for patients 12 to 17 years (n=25), black 
patients (n=44), patients of other races (n=97) and patients enrolled in the US (n=105).

Figure 1: Reslizumab Effect by Race 
A post-hoc analysis was performed for the primary endpoint stratified for the number of exacerbations in the 
previous year. Overall, 58% and 59% had one CAE and 18% and 22% had two prior CAE in the preceding year 
for placebo and reslizumab treated patients, respectively. Fourteen percent and 10% had ≥4 CAEs in the 
preceding year for placebo and reslizumab, respectively.  The results show that reslizumab reduced CAE rate 
ratios for all values of number of exacerbations in the preceding year, with reductions of 32%, 56%, 61%, and 
64% for 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 exacerbations in the preceding year, respectively.  
Post-hoc analyses subgroup of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (GINA step 4/5) 
At the CHMP’s request, post-hoc analyses were presented for the severe eosinophilic asthma population based 
on the integrated data from studies 3082 and 3083 using the GINA classification. Within both studies, most 
patients were characterised as GINA step 4 (68% in study 3082 and 70% in study 3083) with a minority being 
classified as GINA step 5 (13% in study 3082 and 9% in study 3083). The remaining population was classified 
as GINA step 3 (11% and 16% for study 3082 and 3083, respectively). Overall, about 80% of the population was 
classified as GINA step 4/5. 
The outcomes for the primary and main secondary endpoints are summarized in the Table below for the 
subgroup of patients with GINA 4/5.

Of note, favorable beneficial effects were also observed in patients with GINA 3 as well; CAE rate ratio was 0.60 
(95% CI: 0.30, 1.19). For the main secondary endpoints, numerical improvements was seen for FEV1 as well 
(mean change from baseline: 0.090, 95% CI: -0.019, 199), but this was less obvious for patient reported 
outcomes. 
Post-hoc analysis in patients with refractory asthma and in patients with non-refractory asthma 
At the CHMP’s request, a post-hoc analysis of reslizumab efficacy in patients with refractory asthma and in 
patients with non-refractory asthma was performed. 
Based on the definition and available data, 306 (32%) out of 953 patients for the integrated Studies 3082/3083 
population met the definition of refractory asthma, and 647 (68%) patients were non-refractory.  
The results of the primary endpoint and the main secondary endpoints are shown below. The post-hoc analyses 
show clinically relevant reductions in annual rate of exacerbation in both the refractory (59%) and 
non-refractory (49%) subgroup. The results are supported by the effects on lung function and patient reported 
outcomes.

Study 3084: A 16-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) Treatment in Patients With Moderate to Severe 
Asthma. 
Adult patients (aged 18-65 years) with a diagnosis of asthma and an ACQ score of at least 1.5, airway 
reversibility of at least 12% to beta-agonist administration and currently taking fluticasone at a dosage of at 
least 440 mg daily (or equivalent) were included in the study. Patients were unselected for blood eosinophil 
level. The primary objective was to characterize the efficacy of reslizumab treatment 3.0 mg/kg (every 4 weeks) 
in improving pulmonary function in relation to baseline blood eosinophil levels, based on change from baseline 
to week 16 in FEV1. Secondary efficacy endpoints were pulmonary function as measured by FEV1, % predicted 
FEV1, FVC, and FEF25%-75% at specified time points. In addition SABA use, ACQ and blood eosinophil count 
was measured. In addition, safety was assessed. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:4) to receive an 
infusion of placebo or reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.  
A total of 496 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and analysed. The treatment groups (3.0 mg/kg 
reslizumab treatment group and placebo) were similar in regard to age (mean 44.9 and 45.1 years, 
respectively), race (65% and 74% white, respectively). A similar percentage of patients had an asthma 
exacerbation within the last 12 months prior to randomization, 40% and 41%, respectively. A minority of 
patients had baseline eosinophils ≥ 0.4x109/L (Placebo: n=19/97 (19.6%), Reslizumab: n=77/395 (19.5%)).  
The primary efficacy analysis (linear regression) failed to show a significant interaction between baseline blood 
eosinophil count and change in FEV1 at week 16: slope difference (active–placebo) was 0.3007 (SE=0.2559, 
p=0.2407). Secondary efficacy analyses showed small numerical improvements for the overall population 
compared to placebo, with substantially larger improvements in the ≥400/μL subgroup.  
Study 3085: An Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) as Treatment for Patients With Eosinophilic Asthma Who Completed a 
Prior Teva-Sponsored Study in Eosinophilic Asthma 
Patients included in study 3085 had completed study 3081, 3082, or 3083 or received at least two doses of study 
drug in study 3081. The primary objective was to obtain long-term safety data (up to 24 months). Secondary 
objective was to study the long-term efficacy of reslizumab based on change from baseline in pulmonary 
function tests (FEV1, % predicted FEV1, FVC, FEF25%-75%) and other measures of asthma control (SABA use,

ASUI ACQ and AQLQ). In addition, blood eosinophils were assessed. Patients were expected to participate in this 
study for up to 27 months. 
A total of 1052 patients with eosinophilic asthma were enrolled in this study, 1051 (>99%) patients received at 
least 1 dose of reslizumab and were evaluated for safety. Four hundred-eighty (46%) patients received 
reslizumab for the first time. A total of 50 (5%) patients completed the 104-week treatment period and 
follow-up. A total of 1002 (95%) patients discontinued the study prior to completion, and 896 of these (85% of 
enrolled patients) did not complete the study due to early termination of the open-label study by the Sponsor. 
Indeed, the study was prematurely terminated with the rationale that the primary study objective had been 
sufficiently met that the enrolment had substantially exceeded the original planned sample size and the primary 
study objective, in terms of open-label safety events for patient exposure to an investigational product with an 
unconfirmed benefit/risk profile, would have been substantially met at that time. 
Considering the previous studies, 277 patients (49%) had ≥24 months of treatment with reslizumab. Overall, 
the mean age of patients in the study was 47.2 years. Sixty-one percent of patients in the study were female, 
77% were white, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. 
For the reslizumab-experienced group, baseline lung function was maintained through the treatment period; 
values at endpoint were similar to baseline. For instance for FEV1, there was no change from baseline at week 
4 and a change of 0.010 L at week 48. Trends for improvement in pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, and 
overall quality of life scores were observed in reslizumab-naïve patients who were new to therapy. Reslizumab 
treatment produced a decrease in blood eosinophil levels in reslizumab-naïve patients, similar to the levels in 
reslizumab-experienced patients after the first dose. In an open label phase 3 extension study, low titre, 
frequently transient anti reslizumab antibodies were detected in 49 out of 1,014 asthma patients (5%) who 
received 3 mg/kg reslizumab for up to 36 months. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The in-and exclusion criteria for the dose-response study (3081) and pivotal trials (3082 and 3083) were largely 
similar, except that patients in the pivotal trials patients had to have at least one exacerbation in the previous 
year and oral corticosteroid use was allowed. Patients were inadequately controlled despite treatment with at 
least medium- to-high dose of inhaled corticosteroids (440 µg/day fluticasone propionate or equivalent). The 
minimal ICS dose corresponds to a 500 µg/day metered dose which is at the high end of the medium dose range 
for GINA step 3 (>250-500 µg/day). Therefore patients included could range from GINA step 3 to GINA step 5. 
This corresponds to a formerly called moderate (GINA 3) to severe (GINA 4 and 5) asthma population. In 
principle, a positive benefit-risk needs to be demonstrated for each grade of asthma severity to be included in 
the claimed indication. The pivotal studies were placebo controlled which is acceptable for a “severe” 
eosinophilic asthma population (GINA 4/5). For a population encompassing GINA 3, other treatment options are 
available (e.g. addition of LABA or increased dose of ICS) and an active controlled trial might be more 
appropriate in this population as recommended within the CHMP guideline. Post-hoc analyses were performed 
for the patient population classified as GINA 4/5 to assess the primary and main secondary endpoints in the 
severe eosinophilic asthma population. 
At baseline patients were symptomatic. An additional post hoc sensitivity analyses was made to assess the 
benefit in the refractory patient population. The refractory patient population was defined by the American 
Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) 2000 workshop; the high-dose ICS was based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 70/108 
  
  
the 2014 severe ATS/ERS guidance table, which accommodates more recent formulations (Chung et al 2014). 
The benefits of reslizumab were assessed in this population as well.  
Given the difficulties in measurement of sputum eosinophilia requiring access to specialised laboratories with 
trained personnel, the elevation of blood eosinophils was selected as a practical surrogate of sputum 
eosinophilia for the Phase 3 reslizumab studies. Although the correlation between blood eosinophilia and sputum 
eosinophilia is poor, this is acceptable as the measurement of sputum eosinophils has not been sufficiently 
standardised and is not widely available. Hence, this approach is considered acceptable. Asthmatic patients with 
an eosinophilic phenotype which could benefit from reslizumab were selected based on elevated blood eosinophil 
count (≥ 400 cells / µL).  
The lowering effect of reslizumab on blood eosinophil count might hamper the blinding of the study. Several 
measurements were taken by the sponsor to avoid unblinding of personnel involved in collection of efficacy data 
such as redacting eosinophil count data from the haematology results. The CHMP is of the opinion that 
appropriate strategies to maintain the blind were put in place by the Applicant. 
The use of the negative binomial model for exacerbation rate is considered acceptable, as it describes the 
population as a mixture of subpopulations with fixed rates (Poisson distributions). The sensitivity analysis for the 
primary outcome based on missing data assumes that patients withdrawing for reasons other than asthma 
exacerbation or lack of efficacy are missing at random, which is reasonable. For patients missing for imputation 
asthma exacerbation or lack of efficacy, the imputing data from the placebo group is conservative. Therefore, 
the overall imputation strategy is considered acceptable. The rest of the statistical methods is considered 
standard and acceptable. 
Endpoints 
Study 3081: The primary endpoint (change in FEV1 over 16 weeks) and secondary endpoints (lung function 
tests, asthma symptoms and quality of life) are considered appropriate. Effect on blood eosinophil count is 
considered an appropriate PD parameter. Only two doses were explored with the lower dose of 0.3 mg/kg 
assumed to be a minimally effective dose. The addition of an intermediate dose might have completed the 
dose-exploration phase.  
The pivotal studies 3082 and 3083 were of 1 year duration, a sufficient duration to measure the improvement in 
exacerbations. The frequency of clinical asthma exacerbations per patient year is a clinically relevant endpoint 
for a controller medication (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1). The definition (defined as either systemic 
corticosteroids use or a two-fold increase in ICS for ≥3 days, or an asthma-related emergency 
visit/hospitalization accompanied by a worsening in clinical signs and symptoms of asthma) is appropriate. The 
exacerbation definition included the “increase of ICS ≥ 3 days” which is appropriate according the draft 
guideline of asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1). Lung function based on FEV1 is considered an important key 
secondary endpoint. Other secondary parameters assessing lung function, asthma symptoms and blood 
eosinophil count provide relevant information as well. Within their Day 121 response, the applicant clarified that 
lung function measurements were not pre-specified, which might enhance variability within these 
measurements. However, over 92% (study 3082) and 83% (study 3083) of the sites used the ATS/ERS 2005 
criteria. The withdrawal times for spirometry were pre-specified for SABAs and LABAs, but not for other 
medications such as anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives. Post-hoc analyses showed that 10% of patients 
used anti-cholinergics and up to 12% used xanthine derivatives. Given the randomised blinded design of the 
study, the potential use of these drugs near the time of spirometry is not considered to bias assessment of the 
secondary endpoints in favour of reslizumab. 
No data are currently available on the possibility to reduce concomitant controller medication like OCS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 71/108 
  
  
The overall design of studies, although slightly different at the time of SA, was in line with the CHMP scientific 
advice and deemed acceptable (see Section 2.1). 
During the assessment, the Applicant removed some published literature references listed in Annex A of the 
marketing authorisation application as it could not be excluded that the underlying data may be subject to data 
protection. The CHMP carefully considered the removal of the concerned references and concluded that it did not 
impact the integrity of the dossier and the evaluation performed.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose finding 
From the patient population (n=315) included in the dose-finding study (3081) about 56% experienced an 
exacerbation in the past 12 months. Post-hoc analyses showed that most patients were classified as GINA step 
4 (79%), followed by GINA step 3 (17%) and <1% as GINA step 5. A statistical and clinical significant change 
from baseline in FEV1 over 16 weeks was shown for both the low and high dose compared to placebo (0.3 mg/kg: 
0.115 L, 95%CI: 0.016-0.215; 3.0 mg/kg: 0.160 L, 95%CI: 0.060-0.259). The overall treatment effect was 
numerically larger for patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group. A similar pattern was seen for 
secondary endpoints. These results support the use of reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg within the range of investigated 
doses.  
Pivotal studies 
The pivotal phase 3 studies (3082 and 3083) included a total of 953 patients. The mean number of 
exacerbations in the previous year was 2.0, most patients used a second controller at baseline (>80%) and 
about 15% used OCS at baseline. Post-hoc analyses showed that overall 69% of patients were classified as GINA 
4 and 11% as GINA 5, consistent with a severe eosinophilic asthma population. The remaining part (13%) was 
classified as GINA 3.  Further, almost 60% of patients had 1 CAE in the past year and about 20% had 
experienced 2 CAEs, frequencies of previous exacerbations were in general balanced between treatment groups. 
Over 85% completed the study and few patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy (<1%) or adverse events 
(<5%), showing that the treatment was well tolerated. However, about one quarter of patients had protocol 
violations in both studies. The applicant clarified within their Day 121 response that a conservative approach 
was taken as all protocol deviations were classified as violations. There was no apparent clustering of violations 
in certain centres and no indications of GCP misconduct that would trigger an inspection. 
Both studies showed a statistical and clinically relevant reduction in clinical asthma exacerbations (CAE); the 
reduction in CAE rate during the first year was 50% and 59% in study 3082 and 3083, respectively.  Most CAEs 
was based on systemic corticosteroid use, which indicate severe exacerbations: in that case the reduction of 
exacerbation was 55% and 61%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed comparable results suggesting a 
robust effect. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis on the per protocol population yielded results comparable to the 
primary analysis (46% and 60% reduction in CAE rate for study 3082 and study 3083, respectively). No 
statistical significant effect was shown for CAE based on an emergency visit or hospitalization, which may be 
explained by limited numbers.  
The results of the primary analysis are supported by a clinically relevant effect on FEV1; the mean increase over 
16 weeks compared to placebo was 0.137 L and 0.093 L for study 3082 and 3083 (p<0.05), respectively. 
Besides an improvement in lung function, patients reported statistically significant fewer asthma symptoms and 
reported an improved quality of life compared to placebo. An effect was seen as early as 4 weeks after start of 
treatment and maintained throughout the study period. The combination - an improvement in exacerbations, 
symptoms and lung function - indicates an overall better inflammatory control. Results of the FAS, which

excluded data that may have been affected by a restricted concomitant asthma medication were consistent with 
that of the primary analysis using the ITT population. 
Efficacy was accompanied by a reduction in the number of blood eosinophil count, which support that the 
improvement in lung function was obtained because of better inflammatory control. A return towards baseline 
values of blood eosinophil count was demonstrated within a limited number of patients (n=36 combined data) 
but blood eosinophil counts were still reduced at 4 months after stop of treatment. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint showed consistent results across gender, age except for adolescents, 
black patients and patients of other races and patients enrolled in the US.  
The adolescent population was small (n=25 combined) and is not part of the indication. Paediatric patients < 18 
years old have been added as a missing information in the RMP and the SmPC adequately reflects this 
information. 
The lack of effect in subgroups such as black patients and US population could be explained by a lower 
background rate of exacerbations and an overall better asthma control according to the applicant. However, 
these finding remains unexplained. There are currently no indications of genetic factors to be involved in a lower 
response in these subpopulations. In addition, the improvements observed in FEV1 in these subpopulations are 
reassuring. Non-white patients have been added as topic for missing information to the RMP. 
A post-hoc analysis showed that reslizumab reduced CAE rate ratios for all values of number of exacerbations in 
the preceding year, with a 32% reduction in patients with 1 prior CAE and a 56% to 64% in patients with 2, 3 
or ≥4 previous CAE . 
A post-hoc analysis was performed according to the GINA classification in order to identify the benefit in the 
subgroup of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma based on GINA classification4/5. The overall results of the 
primary and main secondary endpoints yielded similar results as the primary analysis, with numerically higher 
treatment effects for this subgroup. The largest effects were seen in the subgroup GINA 5 The overall reduction 
in CAE rate for GINA 4/5 was 56% (RR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.56) compared to 54% (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.37, 
0.58) for the total population based on the integrated data from studies 3082 and 3083.  
Beneficial effects were also observed in patients classified as GINA 3 based on CAE and FEV1, but less obvious 
for patient reported outcomes. Within this patient group, however, additional treatment options are available 
such as the addition of LABA’s. As no data are available on the effect of reslizumab compared to LABA, the 
patients with GINA 3 are excluded from the indication.  
In addition, a post-hoc analysis was performed in patients with refractory asthma, based on the American 
Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) 2000 workshop definition and baseline 
characteristics that were available in the Studies 3082 and 3083 databases. These analysis showed that 306 
(32%) out of 953 patients for the integrated Studies 3082/3083 population met the definition of refractory 
asthma. Reslizumab produced clinically meaningful reductions in the annual rate of asthma exacerbation in the 
refractory (59%) and non-refractory (49%) population as well (integrated Studies 3082/3083 population). 
These results were supported by the main secondary endpoints. Overall, the results show a consistent picture of 
efficacy of reslizumab in the included study population, which is considered mainly a severe eosinophilic asthma 
population.  
The presence of ADA did not appear to impact efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 73/108 
  
  
The number of elderly patients was limited as can be expected for an asthmatic population. Current clinical data 
do not indicate a differential effect supported by PK and no additional follow-up measurements are currently 
deemed necessary. Elderly patients > 75 years old has been added as a missing information to the RMP. 
Use of other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents was not allowed. This information is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC and has been added as a missing information to the RMP. 
Preliminary results of the long-term follow-up study 3085 support efficacy in the long-term. 
Lack of efficacy in an overall asthma population unselected for blood eosinophil count (study 3084) support that 
reslizumab is only effective in an eosinophilic asthma phenotype.  
Finally, for patients on a high medium ICS dose + second controller, the maintenance treatment can be 
increased to a high dose ICS + LABA. The expected benefit is small because of the flat dose response of inhaled 
corticosteroid. However, some patients may still benefit. In addition, an increase in inhalation therapy is 
considered more convenient for the patient compared to reslizumab’s 4 weekly intravenous drug administration. 
Therefore, the CHMP requested the Applicant to restrict the indication to patients are still inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.  
The Applicant accepted the CHMP’s revised indication as follows: 
“CINQAERO is indicated as add on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.” 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Reslizumab at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg once every 4 weeks has shown a clinically relevant reduction in the frequency 
of exacerbations in asthmatic patients who are inadequately controlled despite medium-(high end) to-high dose 
ICS (at least 440 µg of inhaled fluticasone propionate or equivalent total daily dose) with elevated blood 
eosinophil levels ≥  400 cells/µL and who mostly used a second controller medication. 
Further, reslizumab improved lung function and asthma symptom, outcome measurements which support that 
a better inflammatory control has been achieved. Most patients were severe eosinophilic asthma patients (GINA 
4/5) for which limited other treatment options exist. A clinically relevant treatment effect was also shown 
independent of the number of previous exacerbations and in the refractory asthmatic population. 
No statistical significant effect was shown for CAE based on an emergency visit or hospitalization. 
Beneficial effects were also observed in patients classified as GINA 3 based on CAE and FEV1, but less obvious 
for patient reported outcomes. Within this patient group, however, additional treatment options are available 
such as the addition of LABA’s. As no data are available on the effect of reslizumab compared to LABA, the 
patients with GINA 3 are excluded from the indication. 
No data are currently available on the possibility to reduce concomitant controller medication like OCS. 
Some patients on a medium dose of ICS may benefit from an increase in ICS dose and this is considered more 
convenient for the patient compared to intravenous administration with reslizumab. Therefore the CHMP 
requested the Applicant to restrict the indication as follows: 
CINQAERO is indicated as add on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment 
(see section 5.1)

The Applicant accepted the CHMP’s revised indication. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety includes 14 studies that were conducted with reslizumab treatment.  
Apart from study NIH 01-10155, all studies were integrated into 6 cohorts in the Integrated Summary of Safety 
(ISS). The exclusion of these patients is considered acceptable, because the number of patients in study NIH 
01-10155 was low, i.e. 8 patients, and the investigated dose is lower than the recommended dose, i.e. <0.1 
mg/kg.  Cohorts 3, 4, and 6 were presented as the primary focus of the safety evaluation.  
•  Cohort 3 (N=1861): This cohort included all exposed patients from placebo-controlled asthma Studies 
Res-5-0010, 3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084, where patients received at least 1 dose of study drug up to 52 
weeks.  
•  Cohort 4 (N=1611): This cohort included all reslizumab-treated patients from Cohort 3, plus the data from 
the open-label extension Study 3085 as of 01 September 2014 (N=1596; continuously exposed to 3.0 
mg/kg. Cohort 4 is supportive for long term safety as it included also open label study 3085. 
•  Cohort 6 (N=2187): This cohort included all exposed patients and healthy subjects in sponsored reslizumab 
studies (any dose, any regimen). It is intended to help capture rare events. 
Other cohorts created were: Cohort 1 containing the same studies as Cohort 3 but only up to 16 weeks, Cohort 
2 including the 52 weeks studies 3082 and 3083 and Cohort 5 including all asthma patients exposed to 
reslizumab, regardless of dose and regimen.  
In order to assess the safety of the intended population i.e. all asthma patients with baseline or screening blood 
eosinophils ≥400/µL and using the proposed marketed dose of reslizumab 3.0 mg/ an additional cohort was 
created “targeted cohort”. Only the adverse event data and the long-term safety (exposure to reslizumab for 
>12 and >24 months) were analysed.  
This overview will emphasize on the safety data presented in Cohort 3, considering these data as the main data. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2195 patients or healthy subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of reslizumab. Of these, 1659 
subjects received the recommended dose.  
In Cohort 6 (all reslizumab Studies except Study NIH 01-10155) the total patient-years exposure for these 2187 
reslizumab-treated patients was 2155.3 years. The mean duration of treatment for reslizumab-treated patients 
was 360.0 days (range: 1 to 1340 days).  
Overall exposure and long term exposure are sufficient as in total 922 patients were treated for greater than 12 
months of which 759 patients with reslizumab (Cohort 4). Moreover, 237 asthma patients were treated for at 
least 24 months. A total of 1006 asthma patients were treated with reslizumab for at least 6 months.  
Extension, open-label study 3085, was intended to obtain additional safety data for reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg for up 
to 24 months. It has been prematurely terminated with the rationale that the primary study objective had been 
sufficiently met that the enrolment had substantially exceeded the original planned sample size and the primary 
study objective, in terms of open-label safety events for patient exposure to an investigational product with an 
unconfirmed benefit/risk profile, would have been substantially met at that time. 
A total of 50 (5%) patients completed the 104-week treatment period and follow-up, while 1002 (95%) 
discontinued the study prior to completion, of which 896 (85%) due to early termination.

Overall exposure and long term exposure are sufficient as in total 922 patients were treated for longer than 12 
months (Cohort 6) and 994 asthma patients were treated with reslizumab for at least 6 months, 743 patients 
were treated with reslizumab for at least 12 months (Cohort 4). Moreover, 213 asthma patients were treated for 
at least 24 months.  
In spite of the vast number of discontinuations due to early termination of study 3085 a sufficient number of 
data is available for the purpose of assessing long term safety in the complete clinical package. From that point 
of view there is no objection against the early termination.  
Demographics and baseline  
Overall, a total of 62% were women and 38% were men, consistent with the demography of the adult and 
adolescent asthma population. The proportion of White patients in the combined reslizumab population (71%) 
was slightly lower than in the placebo population (75%). The higher proportion of White patients in the placebo 
group yielded a lower proportion of Black patients as compared with the all reslizumab group (8% compared to 
13%, respectively). Within the reslizumab treated patients, patients in the reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg treatment 
group were 71% non-Hispanic and non-Latino, whereas non-Hispanic and non-Latino patients accounted for 
85% of the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group population. 
At baseline, assessments of respiratory function status (ACQ score, airway reversibility, FEV1, AQLQ, ASUI, and 
occurrence of asthma exacerbation within the last 12 months) were similar between reslizumab- and 
placebo-treated patients and indicative of an inadequately controlled asthma population.

Mean eosinophil count was slightly lower in reslizumab 3.0-mg/kg-treated patients (0.498 × 109/L) compared 
with placebo-treated patients (0.586 × 109/L). In Cohort 3, 1463 of the 1861 patients (78.6%) had eosinophil 
counts ≥400 cells/μL at screening or baseline. In Cohort 4, 1300 of the 1611 patients (80.7%) treated with 
reslizumab had eosinophil counts ≥400 cells/μL at screening or baseline. 
Adverse events 
In Cohort 3, the overall pattern of adverse events by frequency, severity, and relationship to study drug was 
similar between the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups (Table 29).

Cohort 1 containing data up through 16 weeks shows that the adverse event trends observed from Cohort 3 are 
also apparent at an earlier time point in the course of reslizumab treatment.  
There is also no difference in the frequencies of the (serious) adverse events, treatment-related adverse events 
and discontinuations due to an adverse event between Cohort 3 and targeted Cohort 3 (i.e. patients with 
Eosinophils at east 400/μL at Screening and/or Baseline).  
The long term exposure to reslizumab did not result in notable differences in adverse event incidence between 
Cohort 4 (overall 74% in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg) and Cohort 3 (67% in Reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg).  
Common Adverse Events 
A total of 690 (67%) of the 1028 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group and 589 (81%) of the 730 patients 
in the placebo group reported at least 1 adverse event during the course of the individual study periods. There 
was no adverse event preferred term (PT) reported for reslizumab that occurred with a frequency greater than 
1 percentage point higher than that of the corresponding placebo frequency.   
For all events, the incidence of events was similar or lower for the reslizumab group versus the placebo 
treatment group with the exception of Neoplasm, benign, malignant and unspecified SOC, in which a slightly 
higher incidence was reported in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group (11 [2%] patients) than in the placebo group 
(4 [<1%] patients).  
The most commonly reported adverse event in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group was asthma (232 
[23%] patients in reslizumab treatment group compared with 289 [40%] patients in the placebo treatment 
group); asthma worsening was to be reported as adverse event, per protocol.

The next most common PTs (reported in >5% of patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group) were 
nasopharyngitis (103 [10%] and 103 [14%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; 96 [9%] and 69 [10%] patients, respectively), 
headache (78 [8%] and 62 [9%] patients, respectively), and sinusitis (57 [6%] and 51 [7%] patients, 
respectively). 
The incidence of all common adverse events (>2%) was the same or higher in the placebo group compared to 
the reslizumab treatment group with the exception of oropharyngeal pain (reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 2.6% and 
placebo 2.2%, respectively).

In Cohort 4, the frequency of adverse events by SOC was slightly higher than was observed in Cohort 3 for the 
reslizumab-treated groups. A total of 1172 (73%) of the 1596 patients with continuous exposure to reslizumab 
3 mg/kg reported at least 1 adverse event during the course of the individual study periods in this cohort.  The 
overall most common adverse events reported were asthma, nasopharyngitis, URTI, headache, and sinusitis.  
Given the increased length of observation and length of exposure, yet in the events rates (which weigh heavily 
in the duration of exposure) the same magnitude of increase was not seen. 
In the “targeted Cohort 3”, the proportion of patients with at least 1 AE incidence was higher than in Cohort 3; 
a total of 517 (72%) of the 717 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group and 524 (81%) of the 643 patients 
in the placebo group reported at least 1 adverse event during the course of the individual study periods.  
Severe Adverse Events 
Overall, severe adverse events did not occur at a high incidence in either group (70 [7%] and 76 [10%] patients 
in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively).  
The SOCs with the highest incidence of severe events were consistent with the overall adverse event frequency. 
The severe adverse event with the highest incidence was asthma (19 [2%] and 27 [4%] patients in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively). All other severe adverse events were reported with an 
incidence <1%. The most frequently reported severe events following asthma were headache, pneumonia, back 
pain, sinusitis and influenza.  
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Overall a low number of treatment related adverse events were observed, 122 (12%) and 95 (13%) patients in 
the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively. The proportions of events in the reslizumab-treated 
and placebo groups were similar. Very few events occurred in ≥5 patients (<1%) in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
group.  
The most frequent treatment-related adverse events in Cohort 3 were headache, asthma, nausea, fatigue, and 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK).

CPK elevations were observed for:  
•  Blood creatine phosphokinase increased was reported as an adverse event in 20 (1.9%) patients on 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg vs. 12 (1.6%) patients on placebo.  
•  CPK elevation greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) per laboratory data occurred in 25 
(2.4%) patients on reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg vs. 10 (1.4%) patients on placebo. 
•  CPK elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) per laboratory data occurred in 8 
(0.77%) patients on reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg vs. 3 (0.41%) patients on placebo.  
Severe treatment-related adverse events were <1% in both groups (7 [<1%] and 1 [<1%] patients in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively). 
Analysis of treatment-related serious adverse events resulted in a very low number of events (5 [<1%] and 1 
[<1%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively). 
In the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group, treatment-related serious adverse events of anaphylactic reactions were 
reported by 3 patients, and one event each of osteoarthritis and lung adenocarcinoma. The only 
treatment-related serious adverse event reported for placebo patients was 1 case of erysipelas.  
Because the difference is mainly driven by a difference in anaphylactic reaction, this is considered of concern, in 
spite of the low numbers. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infusion reactions, administration site reactions, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, malignancies, infections, and 
musculoskeletal/CPK abnormalities were designated as adverse events of special interest based on potential 
effects of the anti-IL-5 mechanism of action and on individual study results.  
Infusion reactions and administration site reactions 
In Cohort 3, adverse events occurring during or within 24 hours were reported in 30% (306/1028) of patients 
receiving reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg compared with 39% (282/730) of patients receiving placebo. The most 
frequently reported event occurring within 24 hours of the infusion was asthma (6% and 14% in the reslizumab 
3.0 mg/kg and placebo treatment groups, respectively).   
Administration Site Reactions (HLGT) occurred at the same frequency of 2% in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
treatment group and in the placebo treatment group. None of the administration site reactions/events were 
severe, serious, or resulted in discontinuation. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis  
In Cohort 3, the incidence of broad anaphylaxis events as well as broad and narrow angioedema events was 
higher in placebo-treated patients, compared with patients treated with reslizumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016

Five relevant cases in the reslizumab group (<1%) and no cases in the placebo group were observed.  Three out 
of the five anaphylactic reactions (i.e. 3 out of 1028 patients treated with reslizumab) were reported as 
treatment-related serious adverse events, had a temporal link to infusion, were assessed as related to 
reslizumab, and resulted in discontinuation of reslizumab treatment. These reactions were observed during or 
within 20 minutes after completion of the reslizumab infusion and were reported as early as the second dose of 
reslizumab. They were fully resolved with standard treatment with no residual effect. Manifestations included 
skin or mucosal involvement, dyspnoea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms and chills. 
Two cases occurred on the second infusion, and 1 case occurred on the twelfth infusion.  The two other 
anaphylactic reactions concerned other reasons; were not temporally linked to reslizumab infusion, were 
associated to pre-known food allergy and immunotherapy, and did not result in discontinuation of reslizumab. 
All cases were observed in ADA-negative female patients (2 of whom had medical history of 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis).  
There were no other related cases of anaphylaxis reported for the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg dose in any other 
Cohort. 
Malignancies 
In literature, it is suggested that eosinophils possibly play immunomodulatory role in some tumours Therefore, 
agents lowering peripheral blood and tissue eosinophils could potentially have indirect effects on tumour 
biology. The papers referred to by the Applicant showed conflicting results; there was not enough evidence to 
assume either a protective or a suppressive effect on tumour growth by (depletion) of eosinophils. There is no 
definitive biological evidence that neutralisation of interleukin (IL)-5 or reduction of eosinophil number or 
function is associated with malignancy. 
For reslizumab itself, in the entire clinical program, a total of 24 patients were diagnosed with malignancy: 3 
placebo-treated patients and 21 reslizumab-treated patients (6 patients in placebo-controlled studies and 15 
patients in the open-label extension [OLE] Study 3085). 
In the placebo controlled studies, malignancy was reported in 6 of 1028 (<1%) patients in the reslizumab 3.0 
mg/kg treatment group and 2 of 730 (<1%) patients in the placebo treatment group. There was no malignancy 
in the reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg treatment group.  
An additional 13 patients reported malignant neoplasm during the open-label extension Study 3085 by 01 
September 2014 cut-off date for data integration, thus overall, there were 22 events of malignancy in 
19 patients on reslizumab in Cohort 4. Two additional malignancy cases were not included in this table i.e. 
1 ovarian epithelial cancer and 1 borderline ovarian neoplasm from the ongoing Study 3085, which were 
reported after 01 September 2014. 
The most commonly reported malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients were skin cancers, reported by 8 
patients (5 patients with NMSC and 3 patients with localized cutaneous malignant melanoma). There were 13 
non-skin cancers reported; 8 of these were of the most common tissue types of cancer in the general adult 
population (i.e. lung, breast, prostate, and colon). The remaining 5 malignancies included 1 anal cancer, 1 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 1 plasmacytoma (diagnosed after 147 days on the drug) (Table 33).  
These observed malignancies in the reslizumab clinical development program presented a diverse range of 
common tissue types that would be expected in a primarily adult population.

- Studies Res-5-0010, 3081, 3082, 3083, 3084, and 3085, Safety Analysis Set) 
One patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer and skin SCC. Another patient was diagnosed with 3 skin BCC 
lesions.  
Four of the 19 patients diagnosed with malignancy had a medical history of malignancy. In 2 of these patients, 
the malignancy diagnosed during the study was a reoccurrence of their previous malignancy. One case of colon 
cancer had a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. 
Out of the total number, 8 malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients were diagnosed within 6 months from 
initiation of reslizumab. An additional 6 malignancies (4 at the cut off date September 2014) were diagnosed 
between 6 and 12 months after initiation of the study drug (Table 34).  
Two of the malignancies in the OLE Study 3085 were diagnosed within less than 6 months of exposure to study 
drug leaving 14 patients diagnosed with a malignancy after 6 months exposure to reslizumab. 
No malignancies occurred in children or adolescent patients in any reslizumab study.

Table 31 Incidence of Malignant Tumors by Interval of Time to First Malignancy Occurrence 
(Including Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer) Safety Analysis Set Cohort 4 
To put the findings into perspective, they are compared to large epidemical databases Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD):  
• 
• 
the SEER database do not include non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), melanoma in-situ, and 
recurrences of previously diagnosed malignancies 
the CPRD database do not include recurrences of previously diagnosed malignancies 
The comparison of reslizumab clinical studies malignancy rates to the SEER database and to the CPRD 
demonstrated a higher (yet not statistically significant) rate in the reslizumab studies.  
When comparing with the incidence rates in the SEER, the overall malignancy rates indicated that the observed 
number of malignancies among patients in Cohorts 3 and 4, treated with reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg, was higher than 
the expected values; the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of observed to expected number of events in 
Cohorts 3 and 4 were 1.54 (95% CI: 0.50-3.58, p=0.229) and 1.33 (95% CI: 0.69-2.32, p=0.199), 
respectively. When excluding the malignancies diagnosed within 6 months of study enrolment, the standardized 
incidence ratio (SIR) of observed to expected number of events in Cohorts 4 was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.24-1.45, 
p=0.885).   
When comparing with the CPRD, the SIRs of malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients in Cohorts 3 and 4 
were 1.51 (95% CI: 0.56-3.30, p=0.209) and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.91-2.50, p=0.052), respectively, indicating a 
higher than expected number of malignancies  with cut-off of dates September 2014. With cut-off date February 
2015, the SIR of malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients in Cohort 4 is 1.72 (95% CI: 1.04-2.69, p=0.018). 
When excluding the malignancies diagnosed within 6 months of study enrolment, the standardized incidence 
ratio (SIR) of observed to expected number of events in Cohorts 3 and 4 were 0.25 (95% CI: 0.01-1.41, 
p=0.981) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.44-1.69, p=0.648), respectively. 
Infections 
Forty-five percent of patients in Cohort 3 had at least 1 adverse events reported under the SOC of Infections and 
Infestations and the HLGT of Microbiology and Serology Investigation A higher incidence of events indicative of 
infection was reported in the placebo treatment group (53%, event rate 162.56 per 100 patient-years) 
compared with the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group (41%, event rate 130.86 per 100 patient-years). The 
specific types of infections and incidence were generally similar across treatment groups. A similar incidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 83/108 
  
  
 
 
infections was reported in all reslizumab-treated patients in Cohort 4 (50%, event rate 123.594 per 100 
patient-years). The most commonly reported events indicative of infection were nasopharyngitis (14%), urinary 
tract infection (URTI) (12%), sinusitis (7%), and bronchitis (6%). Overall, the events reported are consistent 
with what is expected in a patient population with an underlying condition of asthma. 
The Phase 3 studies were conducted in regions where helminthic parasite infections are prevalent, including 
South and Central America, Africa, and Asia. There were no helminthic parasitic infections reported or difference 
between treatment groups with adverse events that could be associated with gastrointestinal helminthic 
infections. 
Musculoskeletal system  
Myalgia occurred at a greater frequency in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg-treated patients (10 (0.97%)) than 
placebo-treated patients (4 (0.55%)) in Cohort 3. There was a slightly higher incidence of adverse events 
reported under the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOC within the 24 hours of infusions in the 
reslizumab group compared with placebo group (23 [2.2%] patients and 11 [1.5%] patients, respectively). In 
general, these events were mild, transient, and did not recur with continuing reslizumab treatment. There was 
1 discontinuation for myalgia each in the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups, and there were 
no related reports of myopathy, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. 
Searches of the safety data for a broad-based group of terms associated with muscle disorders showed a similar 
incidence in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group (83 [8.1%] patients) compared to the placebo group (75 [7.8%] 
patients). The results of population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses suggest a relationship 
between reslizumab exposure and musculoskeletal adverse events; however, the model was influenced by 5 
overweight/obese female patients with high reslizumab concentrations and non-specific complaints.  
The possible relationship between CPK elevations and an increase of clinical adverse events of myalgia was 
analysed posthoc. 
Table 32 Musculoskeletal Adverse Events and Significant CPK Elevations by Treatment Group 
Myalgia and CPK elevations are known in other drugs such as statins.  Hence, possible pharmacodynamic 
interactions with potentially myotoxic medications were investigated at the CHMP request in a posthoc analyses 
for the incidence of elevated CPK in patients who were concomitantly treated with potentially myotoxic 
medications. A higher incidence of patients with CPK elevations was observed for on any drug associated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 84/108 
  
  
 
toxic myopathies elevated (10%, placebo; 13%, reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg). This seems mostly driven by patients 
concomitantly treated with statins: CPK Grade 2 was more frequently observed in the reslizumab group (9%, 
placebo; 14%, reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were generally infrequent (reslizumab 65 (6%), placebo 66 (9%)), and no apparent 
trends were observed between the reslizumab-treated patients and their placebo comparators (cohort 3). 
Asthma was the most common serious adverse event reported.

Serious adverse events that were reported by more than 1 patient in the reslizumab group and were not 
reported in the placebo group included chest pain (4 [<1%] patients), anaphylaxis reactions (4 [<1%] 
patients), and falls (2 [<1%] patients). 
Treatment-related serious adverse events of anaphylactic reactions were reported by 3 patients in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. One event each of osteoarthritis and lung adenocarcinoma was reported in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. The only treatment-related serious adverse event reported for placebo patients 
was 1 case of erysipelas.  
In the targeted cohort 3, the pattern was similar.  
In Cohort 4, the overall serious adverse event rate was slightly higher (137 (9%)) than what was observed in 
Cohort 3 reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg patients 6% and the same as Cohort 3 placebo patients (9%). Asthma was 
reported in 38 (2%) of the 1611 patients in the reslizumab treatment group. The next most common PTs 
(reported in ≥3 patients in the reslizumab treatment group) were pneumonia (8 [<1%] patients), anaphylactic

reaction (4 [<1%] patients), chest pain (3 [<1%] patients), breast cancer (3 [<1%] patients), and sinusitis 
(3 [<1%] patients). 
The increase in overall SAE incidence compared to Cohort 3 is likely attributable to the longer period of adverse 
event reporting as well as an increased number of unique serious adverse events within the Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant, and Unspecified SOC and a more diversified array of events observed in the Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders SOC. The slight increase in overall incidence of SAE is a result of the accumulation of 
diverse, low-frequency events over time.  
Deaths 
There were 3 deaths during open label Study 3085 with reslizumab treatment 3.0 mg/kg ; all these events were 
not considered related to the study drug: 1 patient due to progressive anal cancer, 1 patient due to hemoptysis, 
aspiration pneumonia, and cardio-respiratory arrest, and 1 patient who died at home with cardiac arrest 
reported as the cause of death. All these events were not considered related to the study drug. 
Additionally, 1 death occurred in Study 3082 in the placebo group on day 56 of treatment, 1 month after the 
second placebo infusion, most probably due to accidental combined drug intoxication. 
No deaths occurred in any treatment groups in the other studies. 
Laboratory findings 
All clinical laboratory evaluations were performed on Cohort 3 except for Study Res-5-0010, since different 
laboratory normal ranges and clinical significance criteria were used in Study Res-5-0010, and the time of final 
assessment (week 15) was different than the other studies in the cohort.  
Serum chemistry parameters 
In Cohort 3 without Study Res-5-0010, serum chemistry parameters were similar at baseline between the 
placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups, with the exception of CPK (mean CPK 142.8 U/L [median 
105.0 U/L]) and 132.5 U/L [median 97.0 U/L] in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group and in the placebo group, 
respectively.  
Serum chemistry tests were similar at baseline for both treatment groups and remained comparable at 
endpoint. Shifts in serum chemistry variable values from the normal range at baseline to outside the normal 
range occurred infrequently.  
A total of 69 (10%) patients in the placebo group and 95 (10%) patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group had 
potentially clinically significant (PCS) abnormal serum chemistry values. There was a slightly higher incidence in 
shifts to abnormal high in the reslizumab group compared to the placebo group in ALT, ALP, and GGT. However, 
a slightly higher incidence of patients with PCS abnormalities was observed in the placebo group for alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) (13 [2%] patients) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (25 [4%] patients) compared to 
the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group (13 [1%] patients and 32 [3%] patients, respectively). Given the absence of 
any obvious imbalance in the relevant SOCs or HLT, the pattern of ALT and AST abnormalities are not considered 
clinically meaningful.  
PCS abnormalities in CPK occurred more frequently in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group for overall and for CPK 
elevation greater than 5 times and 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (refer to the section above).

Hematology parameters 
In Cohort 3 without Study Res-5-0010, hematology parameters were generally similar at baseline between the 
placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups, and mean changes from baseline to endpoint were low. 
Changes that did occur in hematology variables were generally similar in the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
treatment groups, with the exception of the pharmacological effect of reslizumab on eosinophil count.  
In general, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between the treatment groups in the number (%) 
of patients with potentially clinically important hematology abnormalities, the types of abnormalities, and the 
time points at which abnormalities were reported. The eosinophil count was the only exception, accounting for 
the vast majority of potentially clinically important abnormal hematology values (388 (58%) patients in the 
placebo group and 97 (10%) patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group).  
The incidence of shifts to PCS hematology abnormalities were relatively low in both groups (<1%), with the 
exception of shifts to PCS-elevated eosinophils, which ranged between 3% and 6% in the placebo group and 0% 
and 2% in reslizumab group. 
Urinalysis Parameters 
In Cohort 3 (without Study Res-5-0010), there were no meaningful trends in mean changes from baseline for 
any urinalysis variables: 380 (23%) patients had potentially clinically important abnormal urinalysis values, 165 
(25%) patients in the placebo group and 215 (22%) patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. This difference 
was due to a higher incidence in the placebo group (11%) in PCS urine blood compared to the reslizumab group 
(8%).  
Vital signs  
There was no evidence of any trends in changes from baseline to endpoint (with and without follow-up) in pulse 
or systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after treatment with reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg, and no apparent 
trends when compared to the placebo group. 
The incidence of PCS abnormal vital signs values was similar between the reslizumab-treated (192 (19%) 
patients) and placebo groups (160 (22%) patients). PCS low body temperature was the most common PCS 
value with the largest difference between the 2 groups with a slightly higher incidence in placebo 
(128 [18%] patients) compared to reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg patients (135 [13%]).  
Analysis of vital sign shifts relative to baseline tended to reduce the frequency of PCS values compared with 
those observed PCS value during the treatment period. No adverse trends were observed.  
Body temperature was the measure that had the greatest frequency of changes from a baseline high 
PCS/normal value to a low PCS value (28 [3%] and 26 [4%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo 
groups, respectively). As the incidences of low body temperature between treatment groups were balanced and 
not associated with any specific adversity, they are not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
No other shifts occurred in ≥1% of patients in either group at endpoint.  
Electrocardiographic Parameters 
In the Cohort 3 patients (excluding Study Res-5-0010), ECG values in the reslizumab-treated and 
placebo groups were comparable for mean heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, QTc interval 
(Bazett and Fridericia), and RR interval measurements at baseline and endpoint. Shifts from normal to abnormal 
occurred with comparable frequency in the reslizumab-treated and placebo treatment groups. None of the shifts 
in the reslizumab-treated patients were considered by the investigator to be clinically meaningful. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 87/108 
  
  
Combined absolute interval prolongations plus change from baseline in QRS and PR Interval were similarly low 
for both the reslizumab-treated and placebo treatment groups. 
Absolute QTc interval prolongations at baseline and endpoint occurred with comparable frequency in both 
groups. The change from baseline in QTc interval and combined absolute QTc interval prolongations plus change 
from baseline values were low overall and generally lower in the reslizumab-treated patients at week 52 and 
endpoint. 
In the other studies, a Japanese subject had a single QTcF >450 msec with a concurrent change in QTcF interval 
from baseline of greater than 30 msec. There were no reported cardiovascular adverse events or clinically 
relevant vital sign findings temporally related to this ECG finding. In addition, there were no medical history or 
laboratory findings to account for the QTcF findings. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The Applicant has provided safety data for following age categories: 12 to 17 years age group, 18 to 64 years 
age group and 65 years and older age group. Only adult patients up to 75 years of age were allowed to be 
included.  
In both 18 to 64 years age group and 65 years and older groups lower incidences of overall adverse events were 
reported in reslizumab (50%-68%) compared to placebo-treated patients (80%-86%).  
Overall, the adverse events (PT) reported were comparable across age groups. The most frequently reported 
adverse events across age ranges were asthma (18%-42% in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and 31%-57% in placebo), 
and nasopharyngitis (10%-26% in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and 13%-31% in placebo). ,   
The frequency of all of these adverse event categories was similar or lower in reslizumab-treated patients 
compared to placebo-treated patients in the age group >65 years, as well as compared to placebo in the age 
group 18 to 65 years of age apart from vascular disorders. For vascular disorders, the adverse events were 
reported for 4 (9%) reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg-treated patients and 3 (5%) placebo-treated patients for >65 years 
of age group. The following table represents the adverse events in subgroups of the adult population Age ≤65 
and Age > 65. 
Experience in paediatric patients is limited. The data did not indicate a difference in the safety profile of 
reslizumab in paediatric patients compared with that in adult patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 88/108 
  
  
Table 34 Selected Adverse Events per CHMP Request by Age Group and Treatment (Cohort 3) 
Furthermore, a review of adverse events reported at a higher frequency in the older age group did not reveal any 
significant differences between reslizumab- and placebo-treated patients.  
Other populations  
Apart for age, the Applicant has performed safety analyses in following subpopulation: gender, race, 
post-baseline anti-drug antibody status, baseline eosinophil count and medication at baseline 
There were more female patients (1103 (62%)) included than male patients 708 (38%).  In general, reported 
adverse events showed the same pattern as in the overall population apart. Anaphylactic reactions were 
reported for 5 (1%) female patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group with no cases reported in male or 
placebo patients. This might be explained by the larger number of females enrolled in the clinical trials and the 
potential for females to be at higher risk for allergic reactions.  
Of the overall population, 1357 (73%) were white, 212 (11%) were black, 138 (7%) were Asian, and 154 (9%) 
were ‘other’ race. In general, the adverse event profile was similar across races.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 89/108 
  
  
 
 
However, in contrast with the lower incidences of adverse events of reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg in the white and black 
race categories compared with placebo, a similar incidence of adverse events was observed in Asian patients 
and those with a race category of ‘other’. The differences in these incidences between reslizumab- and 
placebo-treated patients in different race subgroups were most likely due to a smaller number of patients in the 
latter two race subgroups. 
Same differences were seen between races for reporting adverse events in the SOCs; black patients reported 
adverse events at higher frequency in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group compared to the placebo group e.g. in 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC (13% reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and 11% placebo), while in Asian patients this 
appeared in the Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders SOC (11% reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and 5% placebo). 
The incidence of adverse events was lower in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group (56%-60% reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
was than in the placebo group (69%-71%0 placebo), irrespective of baseline eosinophil count. The adverse 
events (PT) reported were comparable across baseline eosinophil count subgroups and treatment groups.  
Adverse Events by medication at baseline 
Oral corticosteroid use at baseline 
Of the overall population, 146 (7.8%) patients received oral corticosteroid use (OCS) at baseline.  
The most frequently reported adverse events across baseline OCS use subgroups were asthma, 
nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.  
A higher incidence of patients with use of OCS at baseline had adverse events reported in some SOCs in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group compared to the placebo group in contrast to patients without use of OCS at 
baseline.  
In the OCS at baseline group, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia in the reslizumab-treated patients (five 
of 73 reslizumab treated patients) compared to placebo (one of the 73 placebo patients). The reports of 
pneumonia were mainly associated with asthma exacerbations with an infective component. Two pneumonia 
cases in patients treated with OCS at baseline were considered serious; 1 was placebo-treated, 1 was 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg-treated patient, and none resulted in early termination of therapy.  
However, the incidence of pneumonia according to baseline OCS is different when using IVRS or CRF reporting. 
Only with IVRS there is a difference with more reports in the reslizumab group (5 patients vs 1 patient in the 
placebo-group). 
Of the two cases treated with reslizumab, one patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma 2 weeks after 
the pneumonia event, and 1 patient developed “hospital acquired pneumonia”. Both cases are explained by the 
comorbidity: lung carcinoma is a well-known risk factor for pneumonia and hospital admission for hospital 
acquired pneumonia.  
The 4 additional non-serious pneumonia events (1 in a placebo-treated patient and 3 in reslizumab-treated 
patients) did not involve hospitalisation and were of mild (2 cases) or moderate (2 cases) severity.  
Furthermore, in the overall population as well as in patient population without OCS at baseline such higher 
incidence of pneumonia in the reslizumab-treated patients has not been observed.   
Long-acting beta-agonist at baseline and Leukotriene Inhibitor use at baseline  
A total 1308 (70%) of patients received long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) at baseline. In general, the adverse 
event profile was similar in reslizumab- and placebo-treated patients irrespective of use of LABA at baseline. Of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 90/108 
  
  
the overall population, 357 (19%) of patients were using leukotriene inhibitors at baseline. In general, the 
adverse event profile between reslizumab- and placebo-treated patients was similar irrespective of use of 
leukotriene inhibitors. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of reslizumab has been assessed in all the clinical studies. In general, the incidence of 
anti-reslizumab response as well as the antibody titer is low. 
An ADA- status was considered positive: 
- 
- 
if a sample tested positive at any post-dose time point if negative at baseline, or 
if a post-dose ADA titer increased 4 fold or greater from the positive ADA baseline.  
The ADA incidence in 4 of the Phase 3 studies (3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084) was 5% for the 3.0 mg/kg dose 
group. The ADA titers in these studies were low, with the highest titer at 106 with an average percentage of 
transient ADA response of 40%.  
Impact of ADA Response on efficacy 
There were too few ADA positive patients to unequivocally interpret the effect of the development of ADAs on 
CAE, but so far there is no indication of a negative effect of the presence of ADA on the exacerbation rate.  
In studies 3081, 3082 and 3083, 34 patients who received 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab were ADA positive. There were 
no differences observed in the improvements in FEV1 over 16 weeks between ADA positive and negative 
patients.  
Blood eosinophil counts in ADA-positive patients continued decreasing over reslizumab treatment period in a 
way similar to ADA-negative patients, indicating that the presence of ADA did not reduce reslizumab clinical 
effect.  
Impact of ADA Response on safety  
The incidence of adverse events was similar across ADA-positive (52 [64%] patients) and negative (697 [66%]) 
patients and treatment groups. The most frequently occurring SOC (reported in >20% of ADA-positive and 
negative patients) were Infections and Infestations and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders.  
The adverse events (PT) reported were comparable across ADA status and treatment groups. The most 
frequently reported adverse events across ADA status were asthma, nasopharyngitis, and headache. There 
were no reports of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, or myalgia as adverse events in ADA-positive 
patients. 
There was no association of a positive ADA response with hypersensitivity reactions to reslizumab, including the 
reported anaphylactic reactions, all of which were ADA-negative. In addition, there was no indication of adverse 
events related to an immune complex disorder (eg, renal dysfunction and rash).  
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity 
Beyond the 3 anaphylactic reactions, the frequency of hypersensitivity and potential hypersensitivity reaction 
was similar between the placebo and reslizumab groups. These reactions were not associated with a positive 
ADA response and did not result in discontinuation of study drug treatment.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is currently no evidence in the literature discussing drug-drug interactions associated with IL-5 or 
anti-IL-5 antibodies and there are no data to suggest that IL-5 is involved in the regulation of enzymes or 
pathways responsible for drug metabolism.  
In the population PK analysis, there appeared to be no impact of common concomitant medications (leukotriene 
antagonists, systemic corticosteroids, prednisone, and montelukast) on reslizumab exposure. However, in the 
analyses of adverse events by baseline concomitant asthma medications a higher incidence of pneumonia was 
seen in the reslizumab-treated patients compared to placebo in the OCS at baseline group.  The differences have 
been explained by the comorbidity.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Cohort 3, the same frequency of patients reported at least 1 adverse event leading to discontinuation; 48 
(5%) of the 1028 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group and 40 (5%) of the 730 (5%) patients in the 
placebo group respectively.  
Asthma leading to discontinuation was reported in 28 (3%) of the 1028 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
treatment group and in 21 (3%) of the 730 patients in the placebo group. Anaphylactic reaction (3 [<1%] and 
0 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively) was the only additional adverse event 
reported in >2 patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group and not reported in the placebo group that led to 
discontinuation. 
There were no apparent trends in adverse events within the Infections and Infestations SOC: 3 (<1%) patients 
in the placebo group discontinued due to bronchitis events (with no incidence in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
group), and 2 (<1%) patients in the placebo group discontinued due to sinusitis events, with 1 (<1%) patient 
reporting sinusitis in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. In Cohort 1, the most frequently observed SOCs and PTs 
were similar to data at 52 weeks. 
In Cohort 4, adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in a similar frequency (65 [4%] of the 1611 
reslizumab treated patients) and in the same main SOCs compared with Cohort 3 (reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and 
placebo 5% each). Asthma leading to discontinuation was most frequently reported in 29 (2%) of the 1611 
patients in the reslizumab treatment groups. 
However, the number of discontinuations in Cohort 4 is mainly driven by the results of Cohort 3; only 5% of the 
patients in the additional study 3085 completed this study because of early termination of this study. A 
conclusion on continuation of treatment beyond one year of treatment cannot be drawn. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall exposure and long term exposure are sufficient; 1659 subjects received the recommended dose and in 
total 922 patients were treated for greater than 12 months of which 759 patients with reslizumab. A total of 
1006 asthma patients were treated with reslizumab for at least 6 months, while 237 asthma patients were 
treated for at least 24 months.  
In Cohort 3 (all exposed patients from placebo-controlled asthma studies), the overall pattern of adverse events 
by frequency, severity, and relationship to study drug was similar between the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 
mg/kg treatment groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 92/108 
  
  
The reporting of at least 1 AE was higher in the placebo group (81%) than in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group 
(67%). The incidence of events was always similar or lower for the reslizumab group apart from Neoplasm, 
benign, malignant and unspecified SOC. 
When an adverse event preferred term (PT) was reported more frequently for reslizumab, it occurred never with 
a frequency more than 0.5 % higher than that of the corresponding placebo frequency.   
The long term exposure (> 1 year) to reslizumab did not indicate a notable increase in adverse event incidence. 
The small increase in incidences of the most frequently occurring SOCs (reported in >15% of patients) could be 
appointed to the longer observation time.  
The most commonly reported adverse event was asthma, lower in the reslizumab treatment indicating an effect 
in the reslizumab treatment group. The type and incidence of events were as to be expected in a moderate to 
severe, predominantly adult asthma population, i.e. events of URTI. The next most common PTs (reported in 
>5% of patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group) were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory 
tract infection.There are no indications that the AEs increase one-sidedly over the time.  
Overall, severe adverse events occurred in 7% and 10% in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, 
respectively. Asthma was seen with the highest incidence, being lower in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. The 
most frequently reported severe events following asthma were pneumonia, cough, sinusitis and influenza, all 
with comparable frequency. 
The proportions of treatment related adverse events in the reslizumab-treated and placebo groups were similar 
(12% - 13%). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were headache, asthma, nausea, fatigue, 
and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The difference in number of serious treatment related 
adverse events between reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo group is driven by a difference in anaphylactic 
reaction, which is considered of concern, in spite of the low numbers. 
Infusion reactions and administration site reactions were adverse events occurring during or within 24 hours. 
The most frequently reported event occurring within 24 hours of the infusion was asthma. Administration Site 
Reactions (HLGT) occurred at the low same frequency (2%).  None of the administration site reactions/events 
were severe, serious, or resulted in discontinuation.  
Anaphylaxis occurred in five cases in the reslizumab group (<1%) and no cases in the placebo group. Three of 
the 5 cases had a temporal link to infusion, were assessed as related to reslizumab, and resulted in 
discontinuation of reslizumab treatment. All cases were observed in ADA negative female patients. Two cases 
were not temporally linked to reslizumab infusion, and were attenuated to pre-known food allergy and 
immunotherapy, and did not result in discontinuation of reslizumab. This information is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
In the entire clinical program, a total of 24 patients were diagnosed with malignancy: 3 placebo-treated patients 
and 21 reslizumab-treated patients (6 patients in placebo-controlled studies and 15 patients in the open-label 
extension [OLE] Study 3085). In 2 patients, the malignancy diagnosed during the study was a reoccurrence of 
their previous malignancy. The most commonly reported malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients were skin 
cancers, reported by 8 patients (5 patients with NMSC and 3 patients with localized cutaneous malignant 
melanoma). There were 13 non-skin cancers reported; 8 of these were of the most common tissue types of 
cancer in the general adult population (i.e. lung, breast, prostate, and colon). A comparison of reslizumab 
malignancy rates with general population databases and asthma patients’ database (SEER and CPRD, 
respectively) demonstrated a higher (yet not statistically significant) rate in the reslizumab studies. Out of the 
total number, 8 malignancies in reslizumab-treated patients were diagnosed within 6 months from initiation of 
Assessment report

Page 93/108 
  
  
reslizumab. Because malignancy is unlikely to be causally associated with reslizumab, when the malignancies, 
particularly solid tumours, are diagnosed within 6 months of study enrolment sensitivity analyses for the 
comparison of reslizumab malignancy rates with SEER and CPRD were performed. After excluding patients with 
malignancy within 6 months of a minimum reslizumab exposure, the Standardized Incidence Ratio values were 
near or below 1 and remained statistically non-significant. Furthermore, as worst case scenario an analysis 
including the 2 additional patients from study 3085 who were already under surveillance during the placebo 
controlled phase, would have been preferred but are not considered essential. This information is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC and as an important potential risk in RMP.  
A higher incidence of events indicative of infection was reported in the placebo treatment group compared with 
the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group. The most commonly reported events indicative of infection were 
consistent with what is expected in an asthma patient population. No helminthic parasitic infections were 
reported. As eosinophils are possibly involved in the response to helminth infections, adequate warning is 
included in the SmPC and this information is included as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
In all the analyses, CPK is repeatedly observed in a higher frequency than in placebo: overall and CPK elevation 
greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) per laboratory data and CPK elevation greater than 10 
times the upper limit of normal (ULN) per laboratory data. As the difference for CPK elevation greater than 5 
times the upper limit of normal (ULN) per laboratory data exceeds the 1% difference between reslizumab and 
placebo and also other measurements show higher number in the reslizumab group. This information has been 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Myalgia occurred at a greater frequency in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg-treated patients (n=10, 0.97% versus n=4; 
0.55%). In general, these events were mild, transient, and did not recur with continuing reslizumab treatment. 
There was 1 discontinuation for myalgia in each group. Based on the provided data, a relationship between 
myalgia and CPK elevation can neither concluded nor excluded. However, both myalgia and “blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased” are included in the SmPC. 
Because myalgia and CPK elevations are known in other drugs such as statins, potential interactions were 
investigated with potentially myotoxic medications. No patterns can be distinguished for a pharmacodynamic 
relation between reslizumab and a drug known with an increase of clinical adverse events of myalgia as analysed 
by CPK elevations. Therefore, a pharmacodynamic interaction does not seem to be likely. This is supported by 
the facts that drug-drug interactions are not plausible given the properties of reslizumab (a monoclonal 
antibody) and its specificity for soluble interleukin-5. 
Serious adverse events appeared in 65 (6%) patients in reslizumab group and in 66 (9%) patients in placebo 
group without a specific trend. Asthma was the most common serious adverse event reported.  
Serious adverse events reported by more than 1 patient in the reslizumab group and not reported in the placebo 
group were rare, and included chest pain (4 [<1%] patients), anaphylaxis reactions (4 [<1%] patients), and 
falls (2 [<1%] patients). 
The increase in overall SAE incidence for the exposure > 1 year is likely attributable to the longer period of 
reporting. The slight increase in overall incidence of SAE is a result of the accumulation of diverse, low-frequency 
events over time.  
The 3 deaths during open label Study 3085 with reslizumab treatment 3.0 mg/kg were not considered related to 
the study drug. Additionally, 1 death occurred in Study 3082 in the placebo group, most probably due to 
accidental combined drug intoxication. 
The laboratory findings are overall sufficient similar and do not raise concerns.

In the data presented for the different age groups, no specific trend is seen. The frequency of adverse event 
categories specific for elderly was overall similar or lower in reslizumab-treated patients compared to 
placebo-treated patients in the age group >65 years, as well as compared to placebo in the age group 18 to 65 
years of age except for vascular disorders.  
The Applicant has not requested an indication in the paediatric population. Limited data are available in patients 
> 12 years old and no data in patients <12 years old.  
As there are no data in patients >75 years old and in patients <12 years old, the lack of these data is included 
in the missing information of RMP and is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
A higher proportion of patients with use of OCS at baseline in the reslizumab group reported adverse events in 
several SOCs e.g. respiratory tract (URTI, dyspnoea) in contrast to patients without use of OCS at baseline. 
Moreover, pneumonia was reported more frequently in patients with OCS at baseline. Detailed information on 
the severity of pneumonia cases showed that only 2 cases in the reslizumab treated patients were considered 
serious. Moreover, they were due to comorbidity.  
The incidence of the titer of ADAs is low. There was no association of a positive ADA response with 
hypersensitivity reactions or indication of adverse events related to an immune complex disorder. In addition, 
there is also no apparent impact of ADA on reslizumab PK, eosinophil response, and clinical efficacy in terms of 
FEV1 and CAE measurements, indicating a lack of neutralizing activity. The overall safety profile, including 
anaphylaxis, of ADA positive patients was similar to ADA negative patients. Hence, long term exposure, 
including long-term immunogenicity was added as a missing information in the RMP and this information is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis confirm that concomitant use of either leukotriene antagonists or 
systemic corticosteroids does not affect the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab. Reslizumab has not been studied in 
patients concurrently taking immunosuppressant medicinal products other than OCS; therefore, the safety 
profile of reslizumab in these patients is unknown. Use in combination with immunosuppressant drugs therapy 
is included as missing information in the RMP. This information is also reflected in the SmPC. 
Withdrawal from the studies due to a treatment related AEs was overall low (5%) and comparable between 
reslizumab and placebo. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC was built applying the following principle: the AEs were captured with “arithmetic 
cut-off rules” and then assessed for potential relatedness to reslizumab. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall exposure was sufficiently investigated. The overall pattern of adverse events by frequency, severity, and 
relationship to study drug was similar between the placebo and reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups. The 
most commonly reported adverse event was asthma, consistently lower reported in all categories of AEs in the 
reslizumab treatment indicating an effect in the reslizumab treatment group. The incidence of severe adverse 
events as well as the incidence of treatment related adverse events was low and comparable. Severe 
treatment-related adverse events were <1% in both groups. 
Anaphylaxis occurred in five cases in the reslizumab group (<1%) of which 3 treatment related. This information 
is adequately reflected in the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP.

A higher incidence of malignancies in patients in the reslizumab group during the placebo controlled phase and 
the possibly higher frequency compared with the SEER and to the CPRD was observed but after excluding 
malignancies diagnosed within 6 months from initiation of reslizumab SIR values were near or below 1 and 
remained statistically non-significant. A drug-related causality is considered unlikely based on the 
preponderance of common tissue types without a clustering of a particular tumour type or atypical tumours, and 
the similar malignancy rates in both treatment groups in the PCTs after excluding malignancies that were 
diagnosed within less than 6 months of reslizumab treatment) and the results of the comparisons with SEER and 
CPDR. However, malignancy will be continued to be monitored and evaluated via routine pharmacovigilance and 
in a long-term non interventional post authorisation safety study and it will be considered as an adverse event 
of special interest in future clinical studies.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Reslizumab is a humanised anti-IL-5 mAb which binds to IL-5, a cytokine responsible for amongst others 
differentiation and activation of human eosinophils. The subsequent reduction in circulating and tissue 
eosinophils could be beneficial in asthma patients with an eosinophilic phenotype. It is to be given every 4 weeks 
by i.v. infusion as an add-on to standard of care.  
The goals of asthma treatment are control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations. 
Proposed initial indication 
CINQAERO is indicated to reduce exacerbations, relieve symptoms and improve lung function in adult patients 
with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids  
Proposed revised indication 
CINQAERO is indicated as add on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment 
(see section 5.1) 
The recommended dose, based on body weight, is 3 mg/kg, given once every four weeks. 
The main studies in support of clinical efficacy of reslizumab consist of two pivotal randomised, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of identical design (studies 3082 and 3083) with a study duration of one 
year to measure the effects one exacerbations. The data are supported by one short-term (16 weeks) 
randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response study (study 3081).

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Reslizumab showed a consistent reduction in, severe, exacerbations compared with placebo among studies. The 
proportion of patients with at least one CAE decreased from 54.1% to 37.6% and from 45.3% to 25.4% in study 
3082 and 3083, respectively. The reslizumab versus placebo CAE rate ratio was 0.5010 (95% CI: 0.3726, 
0.6737; study 3082) and 0.4063 (95% CI: 0.2819, 0.5855; study 3083), corresponding to a 50% - 59% 
reduction in CAE events per patient year. Sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the results. Most 
patients (>80%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days, indicating a severe exacerbation.  
In addition, reslizumab showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in lung function 
based on FEV1. The treatment difference in LS mean change from baseline over 16 weeks with placebo was 
0.137 L (95%CI: 0.076, 0.198) and 0.93 L (95% CI: 0.030, 0.155) for study 3082 and 3083, respectively. A 
treatment effect was observed at the first observation period of 4 weeks and sustained throughout the study. 
Statistical significant improvements were also seen in asthma symptoms and quality of life, and accompanied by 
a reduction in blood eosinophils.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint showed consistent results for gender, number of prior asthma 
exacerbations, presence of ADA and specific types of baseline asthma medication. 
Long-term data up to two years supports maintenance of effect based on lung function and asthma symptoms 
(study 3085). 
Most patients (about 80%) suffered from severe eosinophilic asthma based on GINA 4/5 classification. Post-hoc 
analyses showed that the reduction of CAE (56%) in this subgroup was comparable to that of the overall 
population (based on integrated data studies 3082 and 3083). Also for the main secondary outcomes (lung 
function and quality of life), results were comparable to that of the overall population with numerical higher 
treatment effects. In addition, post-hoc analyses showed a clinical relevant treatment effect in both the 
refractory and non-refractory population, reduction in CAE rate was 59% and 49%, respectively and supported 
with improvements in the secondary outcome measures.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Beneficial effects regarding the exacerbation rate and lung function were observed in patients classified in GINA 
3 as well. However, in these patients additional treatments are available like the addition of LABA to the ICS 
dose. The clinical data did not provide a direct comparison between reslizumab and LABA. Therefore, the benefit 
of reslizumab over currently approved therapy is not established and these patients are excluded from the 
indication. 
No statistical significant effect was shown for CAE based on an emergency visit or hospitalization. 
Data in elderly (≥65 years: n=32) in the pivotal trials are limited. The adolescent population was small (n=14) 
and subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint did not show results in this population. Adolescents are excluded 
from the indication. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint did not show a significant improvement for black patients and 
patients of other races and patients enrolled in the US. 
No data are currently available on the possibility to reduce concomitant controller medication like OCS. 
The inclusion was limited to patients with eosinophilic asthma (current blood eosinophil level of at least 400/µL), 
because the beneficial effects of anti-IL5 therapy like reslizumab is limited to this asthma phenotype. Indeed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016 
Page 101/108 
  
  
the lack of efficacy in an overall asthma population unselected for blood eosinophil count (study 3084) support 
that reslizumab is only effective in an eosinophilic asthma phenotype. 
Finally, for patients on a high medium ICS dose + second controller, the maintenance treatment can be 
increased to a high dose ICS + LABA. The expected benefit is small because of the flat dose response of inhaled 
corticosteroid. However, some patients may still benefit. In addition, an increase in inhalation therapy is 
considered more convenient for the patient compared to reslizumab’s 4 weekly intravenous drug administration. 
Therefore, the CHMP requested the Applicant to restrict the indication to patients are still inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroid ICS and another controller.  The Applicant accepted the 
CHMP’s revised indication. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported AEs were asthma (39.6% on placebo, and 22.5% on reslizumab), nasopharyngitis 
(14.1% on placebo and 10.0% on reslizumab) and upper respiratory tract infections (9.5% on placebo and 9.3% 
on reslizumab).  
Most commonly reported treatment-related treatment related AEs were headache (2%) and asthma, fatigue, 
nausea, and blood creatinine kinase increase (<1%).  
Serious treatment emergent  AEs were reported at comparable frequencies in both treatment groups (9% on 
placebo and 6% on reslizumab); the most commonly reported in the reslizumab treated group were asthma 
(2%), pneumonia and anaphylactic reaction ( <1% each).  
Serious-treatment related effects occurred only in 5 patients in the reslizumab group including 3 anaphylactic 
reactions, and one event each of osteoarthritis and lung adenocarcinoma. No deaths occurred while on 
reslizumab during the first year, while 3 deaths were reported during the open-label study, all not considered 
related to the study drug.  
Withdrawal from the studies due to a treatment related AEs was overall low (5%) and comparable between 
reslizumab and placebo. 
Overall 5 cases of anaphylaxis were seen in the reslizumab-treated group, of which 3 were considered 
treatment-related. Administration site reactions occurred at the same frequency of 2% in the reslizumab and 
placebo treated group. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC and as an important identified risk 
in the RMP.  
The number of malignancies was higher in the reslizumab treated group (n=6) compared to placebo (n=2) in the 
first year of follow-up. An additional 15 patients reported malignant neoplasm during the open-label study. Most 
commonly reported type of malignancies that occurred in more than 1 patient were basal cell carcinoma (n=3), 
breast cancer (n=3), malignant melanoma (n=2) and prostate cancer (n=2). In order to put the findings into 
perspective, the results were compared with large epidemical databases i.e. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The comparison of reslizumab clinical 
studies malignancy rates to the SEER database and to the CPRD demonstrated a higher (yet not statistically 
significant) rate in the reslizumab studies.  
Additionally, a possibly higher frequency compared with the SEER and to the CPRD was observed but after 
excluding malignancies diagnosed within 6 months from initiation of reslizumab standardized incidence rates 
(SIR) values were near or below 1 and remained statistically non-significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016

Malignancy will be continued to be monitored and evaluated via routine pharmacovigilance and in a long-term 
non interventional post-authorisation safety study and it will be considered as an adverse event of special 
interest in future clinical studies. In addition, this information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Myalgia occurred at a greater frequency in reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg-treated patients compared to placebo (n=10, 
0.97% versus n=4; 0.55%). In general, these events were mild, transient, and did not recur with continuing 
reslizumab treatment. There was 1 discontinuation for myalgia in each group. 
The ADA incidence in 4 of the Phase 3 studies (3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084) was 5% for the 3.0 mg/kg dose 
group. The ADA titers in these studies were low, with the highest titer at 106 with an average percentage of 
transient ADA response of 40%. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A comparison of reslizumab malignancy rates with general population databases and asthma patients’ database 
(SEER and CPRD respectively) demonstrated a higher (but not statistically significant) rate in the reslizumab 
studies. This rate appeared to normalise after excluding patients with malignancy within 6 months of a minimum 
reslizumab exposure of 6 months. Whether reslizumab is associated with an increased risk of malignancies can 
neither be concluded nor excluded as the numbers are low. This uncertainty also exists in literature on the role 
that eosinophils possibly play immunomodulatory role in some tumours as the data show conflicting results on 
the role of eosinophils). In the nonclinical studies, there was no evidence of a mutagenic or carcinogenic effect 
of reslizumab. However, malignancy will be continued to be monitored and evaluated via routine 
pharmacovigilance and in a long-term non interventional post-authorisation safety study and it will be 
considered as an adverse event of special interest in future clinical studies. In addition, this information is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Based on the provided data, a relationship between myalgia and CPK elevation can neither be concluded nor 
excluded. However, both myalgia and “blood creatine phosphokinase increased” are included in the SmPC. 
Analyses of potential interactions with potentially myotoxic medications demonstrated  a higher incidence of 
patients with CPK elevations for on any drug associated with toxic myopathies but mostly driven by patients 
(with normal CPK at baseline) concomitantly treated with statins.  Therefore, a pharmacodynamic interaction 
does not seem to be likely. This is supported by the fact that drug-drug interactions are not plausible given the 
properties of reslizumab (a monoclonal antibody) and its specificity for soluble interleukin-5.  
Regarding the limited data available on the safety profile in patients above 65 years of age, the frequency 
adverse event categories was similar or lower in reslizumab-treated patients compared to placebo-treated 
patients apart from vascular disorders. There were no significant differences between reslizumab- and 
placebo-treated patients in the age groups 18-65 years and >65 years.   
Patients on OCS at baseline reported higher frequencies of events of respiratory tract while on reslizumab 
compared to placebo and the population without OCS. Only two cases of pneumonia in the reslizumab treated 
patients were considered serious while they were confounded by comorbidity. A (pharmacodynamic) interaction 
is not likely. 
The current data indicate that immunogenicity is low and does not appear to impact efficacy and/or safety.  
No information is available on the use of reslizumab in patients concomitantly taking immunosuppressants and 
the impact on the safety profile. Use in combination with immunosuppressant drugs therapy is included as 
missing information in the RMP. This information is also reflected in the SmPC.

Patients with helminthic infections which were excluded from the studies. As eosinophils are possibly involved in 
the response to helminth infections, adequate warning is included in the SmPC and this information is included 
as an important identified risk in the RMP.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Reslizumab add-on to standard of care showed a consistent clinically relevant 54% reduction in the frequency of 
severe exacerbations per patient year. This is considered of clinical relevance in an asthma population, which 
remains uncontrolled despite medium-to-high dose of ICS (at least 440 µg of inhaled fluticasone propionate or 
equivalent total daily dose), the current cornerstone controller treatment. Severe exacerbations constitute a 
major burden to the patient, both in terms of morbidity and mortality with a negative impact on quality of life. 
Besides a reduction in exacerbation frequency, symptomatic improvement was demonstrated based on 
additional relevant symptomatic clinical endpoints. Furthermore, reslizumab showed a clinically relevant

improvement in lung function (overall FEV1 increase of 117 ml). Thereby, the drug meets the criteria of both 
asthma control and reduction in exacerbations which are set for controller medication within clinical guidelines. 
The anti-inflammatory mechanism of action is supported by the strong reduction in blood eosinophil count. 
The pivotal studies included an asthma population that could be classified as GINA 3-5. The inclusion was limited 
to patients with eosinophilic asthma (current blood eosinophil level of at least 400/µL), because the beneficial 
effects of anti-IL5 therapy like reslizumab is limited to this asthma phenotype. 
Most patients (>80%) used LABA in addition to a high medium or high dose ICS (GINA 4/5) representing a 
severe asthma population; only few therapeutic alternatives beyond the add-on treatment with oral 
corticosteroids (OCSs) and/or (for patients with perennial allergies) anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) are 
available in this patient population with persistent eosinophilia. The use of OCS is limited by their well-known 
side effects, whereas anti-IgE has demonstrated modest efficacy on asthma exacerbations in patients with 
allergic asthma, but with small and highly variable effects on lung function.  
Some patients on a medium dose of ICS may benefit from an increase in ICS dose and this is considered more 
convenient for the patient compared to intravenous administration with reslizumab. Therefore the CHMP 
requested the Applicant to restrict the indication as follows: 
CINQAERO is indicated as add on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment 
(see section 5.1) 
The Applicant accepted the CHMP’s revised indication. 
Patients classified as GINA 3 were using a medium to high dose ICS without additional controller. Although 
reslizumab showed beneficial effects in this patient group, the effect has not been compared with the standard 
of care, i.e. the addition of LABA to treatment. Therefore, the B/R for reslizumab cannot be established in the 
GINA 3 subgroup of patients and these patients are excluded from the indication. 
Overall, reslizumab treatment was well tolerated and there were few discontinuations due to adverse events i.e. 
anaphylactic reactions and asthma worsening. The majority of adverse events associated with reslizumab e.g. 
myalgia and CPK elevations, were mild to moderate and transient. Serious adverse events, which were few, 
included anaphylactic reactions. These resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. Immunogenicity appears 
low based on the current data.  
At the moment, it is uncertain whether there is an increased risk for malignancies related to reslizumab 
exposure. More patients in the reslizumab group developed malignancies compared to placebo treated patients, 
but the numbers were low. Comparisons with large epidemical databases (SEER, CPRD) were reassuring as well 
as literature and non-clinical studies. However, malignancy will be continued to be monitored and evaluated via 
routine pharmacovigilance and via a long-term post-authorisation safety study and it will be considered as an 
adverse event of special interest in future clinical studies. In addition, this information is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The observed reduction in (severe) asthma exacerbations and improvement in lung function which is supported 
by other parameters of asthma control outweighs the risks of reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic 
asthma (GINA 4/5) which constitute about 80% of the current study population. The risks associated with 
reslizumab therapy are considered low in view of the safety profile discussed earlier on, and although the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/481610/2016

number of malignancies appear to be higher there are currently no reasons to suspect causality. This will be 
further followed-up post marketing.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Based on the pivotal studies, clinical relevant efficacy has been demonstrated in a severe eosinophilic asthma 
population as most patients (80%) can be defined as GINA step 4/5. Additional post-hoc analyses showed also 
a clinical relevant treatment effect in both the refractory and non-refractory population. Beneficial effects were 
observed in the exacerbation rate supported with lung function and patient derived outcomes.  
Nevertheless, considering the safety profile of CINQAERO, a positive benefit-risk balance for a population, which 
can still be treated with an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroids or addition of another controller, was not 
endorsed by the CHMP. Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the Applicant accepted to restrict the indication to 
patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus 
another controller. 
Regarding the limited data for elderly patients between 65 years and 75 years of age the available information 
showed comparable pharmakinetics, efficacy and safety compared to adults below 65 years. Therefore, it is 
currently concluded that the information is sufficient and does not have to be pursued as missing information.   
The beneficial effect of reslizumab has been demonstrated in asthma patients with an eosinophilic phenotype 
(based on blood eosinophil count ≥ 400 cells/µL) and with at least one previous asthma exacerbation; clinical 
relevant efficacy was demonstrated over the range of prior asthma exacerbations.  
The overall safety profile indicates a good tolerability. Concomitant use with immunosuppressants, risk of 
helminthic infections and anaphylactic reactions are properly addressed in the SmPC and can be followed up 
post-marketing as part of routine pharmacovigilance activities and in the randomised clinical trials 
C38072-AS-30025 and C38072-AS-30027. Long term exposure, including long-term immunogenicity is also 
included as missing information in the RMP.  
The relationship between reslizumab and malignancies has been explored extensively. A drug-related causality 
is considered unlikely based on the preponderance of common tissue types without a clustering of a particular 
tumour type or atypical tumours, and the similar malignancy rates in both treatment groups in the PCTs after 
excluding malignancies that were diagnosed within less than 6 months of reslizumab treatment and the results 
of the comparisons with SEER and CPDR. However, malignancy will be continued to be monitored and evaluated 
via routine pharmacovigilance and in a long-term non interventional  post-authorisation study and it will be 
considered as an adverse event of special interest in future clinical studies. In addition, this information is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The overall B/R of reslizumab is positive for the following proposed indication “CINQAERO is indicated as add on 
therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high dose inhaled 
corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment (see section 5.1)”. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of CINQAERO in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled

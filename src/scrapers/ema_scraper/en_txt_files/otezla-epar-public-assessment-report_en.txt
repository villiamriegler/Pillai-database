2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease which may lead to progressive joint inflammation and 
injury, impaired functional activity and reduced quality of life, necessitating chronic, continual treatment 
to ensure disease control (Gladman, 2001; Mease, 2005a). Current therapies do not always adequately 
control the disease in all patients. Ultimately, most therapies fail to maintain clinical disease control over 
time. An unmet medical need for new treatments remains high, especially for therapies that confer a 
favorable benefit/risk profile, have alternative mechanisms of action, are convenient to use, and address 
both the rheumatic and dermatologic manifestations of PsA. 
Psoriasis is a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment, ideally with effective agents that offer 
convenient dosing and a favorable benefit/risk profile. Despite the variety of treatment options available, 
patients are often dissatisfied with current therapeutic approaches, and their compliance with treatment 
is poor.  Given the limitations associated with current therapies for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 
there remains an unmet medical need for an effective treatment, along with a low incidence and severity 
of adverse events that offers convenient oral dosing. 
About the product 
Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel, oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) that works 
intracellularly to modulate a network of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.Phosphodiesterase 4 is a 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific PDE and is the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. 
Inhibition of PDE4 elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn downregulates the inflammatory 
response by modulating the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, 
and other proinflammatory cytokines. Elevation of cAMP also increases anti-inflammatory cytokines. 
These pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) (Schafer, 2010). The proinflammatory mediators that are upregulated in PsA include the cytokines 
TNF-α, IL-1,IL-6, and IL-8, and the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and 
macrophageinflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) (CC-10004-PSA-002-PD).  
Based on these effects, apremilast is being developed for use in the treatment of various 
immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, PsA, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Behçet 
disease (BD), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A total of 4089 subjects have been exposed to apremilast 
across multiple indications, including 1945 subjects in the PsA Phase 3 clinical program and 1184 subjects 
in the PSOR Phase 3 clinical program. 
The proposed therapeutic indication is: 
“Psoriatic arthritis 
Otezla, alone or in combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), is indicated for 
the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or 
who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy, or who have a contraindication to a DMARD therapy. 
Otezla has been shown to improve physical function.

“Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSOR) 
who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.” 
Type of application and aspect on development 
The applicant has undertaken a comprehensive clinical development programme covering the essential 
aspects in relation to this new chemical entity within the Phase I Clinical Pharmacology and Phase2/3 
Efficacy and Safety programmes. In addition to standard pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the 
package incorporates PK/PD modelling aspects across the development programme which provides a 
thorough understanding of the handling and behaviour of apremilast within the target patient population 
and special groups who might receive this treatment. The data submitted also address the other aspects 
of the product specifications including potential interactions and adverse drug reactions.  The 
development programme, as well as complying with the relevant EU Guidelines for the two proposed 
indications (Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of psoriasis 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02;2005) and psoriatic arthritis (CHMP/EWP/438/04; 2007), has taken into account 
regulatory precedence and the previous CHMP advice received on 24 June 2010 as summarised below:

Standardisation. 
Long-term data (52 weeks) for submission. 
The pivotal studies would only support a 
second-line indication (after inadequate response 
to DMARDs)  
The applicant considered that all key points from the Scientific Advice received have been addressed in 
the design of the clinical studies, with the exception of the following points for which a justification for 
deviation has been provided: 
•  Psoriasis (PSOR) programme 
o  CsA interaction study: This has been omitted as justified by the applicant in section 2.1.10. 
o  Stratification: Although the Phase 3 trials were not stratified according to previous 
therapies, history of PSOR, and background treatment(s), these factors were generally well 
balanced between treatment groups and across studies. 
o  Active comparator: after due consideration, the applicant’s approach has been to use the 
limited patient resources available to fully characterise the efficacy and safety of APR in 
patients with moderate to severe plaque PSOR rather than include an active comparator 
arm. The applicant believes that etanercept is the most appropriate benchmark comparator 
and that its efficacy and safety profile has been well characterised in the target patient 
population. A comparison of the activity of APR with historic etanercept data is therefore 
considered by the Applicant to be feasible and to provide relevant information regarding the 
relative benefit/risk profile of APR.  
•  Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) programme 
o  Primary endpoint (modified ACR 20 response) – instead of being at Week 24 this was 
changed to Week 16 prior to database lock and unblinding.  The Applicant decided to do this 
because, given the design of the study, Week 16 provided the only true placebo-controlled 
evaluation of the efficacy of APR, due to the early escape provision at this time-point for 
placebo-treated patients. The fact that recent clinical trials evaluating other systemic 
therapies in PsA have used primary endpoints between Weeks 12 to 16 supports the validity 
of this change (Antoni, 2005; Mease, 2005b; Kavanaugh, 2009).

The product is available in PVC/ aluminium foil blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of apremilast is 
N-[2-[(1S)-1-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol
-4-yl]acetamide and has the following structure: 
Apremilast is a white to pale-yellow non hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in aqueous buffers 
irrespective of pH range, soluble in acetone, acetonitrile, methylethylketone, methylene chloride and 
tetrahydrofuran. Active substance is classified as having low solubility and low permeability according to 
Biopharmaceutical Classification System (i.e. BCS Class 4).  
The chemical structure of apremilast has been adequately demonstrated by elemental analysis, IR and UV 
spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, single crystal X-ray diffraction and 
XRPD, DSC, TGA, DVS and particle size distribution, and a polymorphism screen (polymorphs were 
characterised using XRPD, DSC, TGA, DVS, TGA/FT-IR and microscopic examination). 
Apremilast exhibits stereoisomerism due to presence of a single chiral centre, with the (S)-enantiomer 
being pharmacologically active. Active substance stability studies and clinical studies have demonstrated 
that there is no interconversion of apremilast (S)-enantiomer to its (R)-enantiomer both on storage and

in vivo. Polymorphism has been observed for apremilast and seven polymorphic forms (designated A-G) 
of the active substance were identified. The desired form B was found to be the most thermodynamically 
stable anhydrous form of apremilast.  The manufacturing process consistently yields active substance of 
single crystal form B. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Apremilast active substance is obtained from two manufacturers. 
The synthesis of apremilast is well described. Two manufacturing processes have been proposed for the 
synthesis of the active substance. Both processes use the same synthetic route, but differ primarily in the 
solvents that are used in the isolation of crude active substance. 
The designation of starting materials was revised during the assessment procedure. 
Apremilast is synthesized in either 4 main steps or 3 main steps, using commercially available, well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The proposed manufacturing processes differ in 
the initial stages of synthesis with different isolated intermediates in which chiral purity is controlled. The 
manufacture of apremilast active substance includes the following steps common to both processes: i) 
coupling (chemical transformation) of the starting materials and intermediates to yield apremilast crude 
and ii) recrystallisation and drying of apremilast crude to yield the desired polymorph, Form B. The 
synthetic route used in the manufacturing process of the active substance is designed to manufacture 
(S)-enantiomer (i.e. pharmacologically active moiety), with enantiomeric purity routinely controlled by 
chiral HPLC. It was demonstrated that there is no inter-conversion between the two enantiomers during 
the manufacturing process and that the final level of the (R)-enantiomer in the active substance reflects 
that present in the intermediates. 
Manufacturing process validation has been carried out for both processes on each of the manufacturing 
sites. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
Chemistry of New Active Substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterisation. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identity (FT-IR,

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance, stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market for 36 months under long term conditions at 
25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines, were provided. 
Additionally, stability data on one commercial scale batch of active substance, stored in a container 
closure system representative of that intended for the market for 24 months under long term conditions 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines, was provided.  
Finally, stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance, stored in a container closure 
system representative of that intended for the market for up to 18 months, under long term conditions at 
25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress 
conditions under acid, base, oxidation and thermal stress were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay and impurities, water, chiral purity and 
polymorphic form. The parameters include those tested for release, with some additional parameters 
being monitored. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release solid dosage form for 
oral use providing high bioavailability of the active substance that is practically insoluble in water 
(7 μg/mL at room temperature). In order to allow for flexibility in posology requirements, film-coated 
tablets containing 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg of apremilast as active substance were developed. 
Physico chemical properties of active substance that could affect critical quality attributes (assay, content 
uniformity, and dissolution), were assessed. During formulation development, different formulations 
were developed. The proposed commercial formulation contains qualitatively the same core formulation 
composition as the formulation used in phase III clinical studies. These formulations were manufactured 
by the essentially the same manufacturing process. Changes in formulation have been supported by 
dissolution studies and f2 comparisons showing adequate product development. In particular dissolution 
comparison was carried out at three pH values, between formulation tablets used in clinical studies and 
commercial formulation tablets. Certain bioequivalence and bioavailability data in support of formulations 
during development has been provided. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except the proprietary Opadry II coating material. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility studies of apremilast with all excipients used in the proposed commercial formulation were 
conducted and compatibility was demonstrated. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 15/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. Firstly the applicant carried 
out risk assessments to identify medium to high risk material attributes and process variables and to 
determine which studies were necessary to achieve product and process understanding in order to 
develop a control strategy. Quality by Design (QbD) studies were then conducted using a Design of 
Experiments (DoE) approach in order to characterise the impact of the medium to high risk parameters on 
the Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) of the finished product. Quality target product profile (QTPP) was 
established and it is analogous to the finished product specifications. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form suitable for 
oral route of administration that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards, and maintains 
the required quality attributes throughout shelf life. 
The critical quality attributes identified were assay, content uniformity and dissolution. Appearance was a 
CQA in coating process. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical 
process parameters. The risk identification was based on the experience from formulation development, 
process design and DoE studies. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified.  
Extensive knowledge of the product has been gained by this development approach, however it is not 
proposed to apply a design space as the relevant parameters impacting finished product performance are 
controlled using a control strategy which includes control of material attributes, control of critical process 
parameters and finished product specifications. The dissolution method was developed considering the 
physico chemical characteristics of the active substance and the finished product. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is PVC/ aluminium foil blister. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: i) blending and lubrication process, ii) 
compression process and iii) coating process. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for standard manufacturing 
process of film-coated tablets. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual), identification (UV, UPLC), assay (UPLC), degradation products (UPLC), content 
uniformity/ uniformity of dosage units (UPLC), dissolution (UPLC), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The 
suitability of the methods in control of the finished product was demonstrated.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 28 batches, 25 of which were commercial scale batches confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of 4 pilot scale batches of each strength for up to 24 months and 16 commercial scale 
batches of 10 mg and 20 mg strength, as well as 17 commercial scale batches of 30 mg strength of 
finished product stored under long term conditions for up to 18 months at 30 ºC / 60% RH and data of 4 
pilot scale batches of each strength and 16 commercial scale batches of 10 mg and 20 mg strength, as 
well as 17 commercial scale batches of 30 mg strength of finished product for up to 9 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay (UPLC), degradation products (UPLC), dissolution (UPLC), 
and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Based on observed variability of batch analysis data for dissolution under accelerated conditions, a 
storage condition of ‘do not store above 30 °C’ was implemented. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical pharmacology programme for Otezla consisted of pharmacodynamic studies in in vitro 
assays and in vivo animal models of inflammatory conditions, and safety pharmacology studies. 
Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to determine ADME and drug-drug interaction potential. The 
nonclinical toxicology programme included single-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats, a series of 
repeat-dose toxicity studies for dosing durations up to 6 months in mice and 12 months in monkeys, 
genotoxicity core battery studies, carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats including 3-month maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) studies to select the dosages for 2-year carcinogenicity studies, reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies in mice and monkeys, local tolerance studies, and a juvenile mouse study.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In Vitro Pharmacodynamic Activity of Apremilast 
Enzyme assays 
The PDE4 enzyme assay results indicated that apremilast is a potent and selective inhibitor of the PDE4 
enzyme isolated from U937 human monocytic cells (Muller, 1998) (half maximal inhibitory concentration 
[IC50] = 74 nM). The specificity of apremilast for PDE4 inhibition was assessed by testing a single 
concentration (10 μM) against PDE1, PDE2, PDE3, PDE5, PDE6, PDE7, and PDE11 enzymes. The results 
indicated that apremilast was between approximately 279- to 40,000-fold more selective for PDE4 
inhibition compared with the other PDE enzymes. 
Apremilast was also investigated for PDE enzyme specificity and was tested against additional 
recombinant human PDEs 1A, 1C, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A1A, 4B1, 4B2, 4C1, 4D2, 5A1, 7A, 7B, 8A1, 9A2, 10A1, 
and 11A4 at room temperature for 1 hour. Apremilast displayed an average of ≈ 95% (range: 91% to 
99%) inhibition of the PDE4 enzymes (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2) in a largely non-selective manner, 
without significant inhibition of other PDEs tested. In dose response inhibition assays (0.001 μM - 10 μM 
apremilast) on recombinant human PDE4s A1A, B1, B2, C1, D2, D3, and D7, IC50 values were 14, 43, 27, 
118, 33, 28, and 30 nM, respectively. 
Apremilast also binds to the high affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS) form of the PDE4 enzyme from rat 
brain. Binding of a PDE4 inhibitor to HARBS has been correlated with increased acid production in rabbit 
gastric acid glands (Barnette, 1995). Also apremilast (IC50 = 74 nM), an optically pure S-isomer of the 
racemate CC-7085, was 8-fold more potent than its R-isomer CC-10007 (IC50 = 611 nM) for PDE4 
enzyme inhibition. Since apremilast does not interconvert to the R-isomer in animals or humans, none of 
the pharmacological activity of apremilast is derived from the R-isomer. 
Binding specificity was investigated in non-GLP study. Apremilast (10 μM) was profiled for binding to 68 
cell surface receptors and for inhibition of 17 enzymes (Report 8611). The results demonstrated that 
apremilast had no significant activity against any of the receptors or enzymes, except for 95% inhibition 
of PDE4, and 52% enhanced agonist binding of the L-type (verapamil) calcium channel receptor. 
However, results from a subsequent study (Report CC-10004-ET-151) confirmed that the 52% inhibition 
of the L-type (verapamil) calcium channel observed at 10 µM apremilast was a false positive hit. Kinase

inhibition profiling of apremilast (10 µM) using Invitrogen's SelectScreen® Profiling Service 
demonstrated that the compound did not significantly inhibit any of the 255 kinases tested. 
Cellular Assays of Inflammatory Responses 
Apremilast was evaluated in human cellular assays examining effects on cytokines derived from 
monocytes and T cells, PGE2 production, cAMP elevation, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression, neutrophil 
adhesion, endothelial cell migration, and antiproliferative/antiangiogenic activity (Table 1) (Report 
5042-107; Report 5424-11; Report 5478-159; Report 5299-148; Report 5197-130; Report 5279-153; 
Report 5127-132; Report 5478-100; Report 5638-35). 
Table 1: Cellular Pharmacologic activity of apremilast  
Human whole blood, pre-treated for 1 hour with apremilast (0.5 and 1.5 μM), was stimulated with LPS for 
18 hours using a TruCulture™  System (Report 7600-043). Apremilast had significant inhibitory effects at 
0.5 and 1.5 μM on TNF-α, IL-12/IL-23 p40, interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and MCP-1 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 19/189 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
production in LPS-stimulated human whole blood (p <0.001). Apremilast also had significant inhibitory 
effects at 1.5 μM on IL-23 p19 and total IL-23 production (p < 0.001). There was no effect on IL-10 
production in whole blood in this system. IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, IL-17A, and IL-22 were below the limit of 
quantitation. The inability to quantify IL-12p70 in this system suggested that the IL-12/IL-23 p40 
expressed in this system is predominantly in complex with IL-23 p19. 
Gene expression studies 
To study the intracellular mechanism of action of apremilast on the PKA and NF-κB pathways, Jurkat T 
cells and THP-1 monocytic cells were incubated with apremilast (0.1 - 1 μM) alone, or with forskolin (10 
μM each), for 30 minutes (Report 7600-011). Jurkat T cells and THP-1 monocytic cells were also 
incubated under the same conditions with IκB kinase (IKK) inhibitor VII for 1 hour, followed by 
stimulation with recombinant human TNF-α (rhTNF-α) or LPS, respectively, for an additional hour. 
Apremilast modulated pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression by activating the PKA-CREB pathway, 
resulting in enhancement of cAMP responsive element (CRE)-driven gene transcription and inhibition of 
NF-κB-driven gene transcription. To study the effects of apremilast on gene expression, HPBMCs and 
monocytes were stimulated for 24 hours and 6 hours, respectively, after incubation with 1 μM apremilast 
for 1 hour. These gene expression studies in LPS-stimulated HPBMCs and monocytes identified several 
targets of gene regulation by apremilast, with effects including the inhibition of many chemokines, 
chemokine receptors, and Th1 cytokine genes, as well as enhancement of the genes encoding the 
anti-inflammatory factor suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), the chemokine epithelial-derived 
neutrophilactivating peptide 78 (ENA-78), and growth factors amphiregulin and bone morphogenic 
protein 6 (BMP-6). 
Apremilast inhibited protein expression of IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG, and TNF-α, but enhanced MMP-1 expression 
(EC 50 = 0.017 μM). However, the effect on MMP-1 was biphasic, enhancing production at 0.1 and 1 μM but 
inhibiting at 10 μM (Report 5478-100; Report BSK-1073). After 6 hours of incubation with 1 μM 
apremilast in LPS-stimulated human monocytes, there was a 1.53-fold increase in IL-10 gene expression; 
however, the change was not statistically significant (Report 7600-011). 
The T cell regulatory cytokine IL-7, produced by chondrocytes and synoviocytes, plays a role in 
inflammatory joint diseases such as arthritis and in bone damage (Long, 2008). In particular, IL-7 mRNA 
and protein levels were increased in synovial fluid of spondylarthritis and RA patients (Rihl, 2008). In 
normal primary human, chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1, IL-6, and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) for 18 hours, 
apremilast (0.1 - 10 μM) significantly inhibited IL-7 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (Report 
5673-140). In this assay, apremilast was a more effective inhibitor of IL-7 gene expression than 
methotrexate (MTX) and ETAN within dose ranges that encompassed their respective maximum plasma 
concentrations (Cmax: MTX = 400 ng/mL and ETAN = 1600 ng/mL). Conversely, apremilast was not as 
effective as prednisolone (PRED). Also, in stimulated primary human normal chondrocytes, apremilast 
weakly inhibited expression of the synovial tissue biomarkers ICAM-1 and alpha-v-beta-3 (αvβ3) integrin. 
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1, IL-6, and IL-6R, apremilast 
significantly inhibited IL-7 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. 
PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to elevate PGE2 production by HPBMCs (Banner, 1999), an effect that 
may involve the activation of a cAMP responsive element in the COX-2 promoter (Schroer, 2002). The 
effect of apremilast (up to 100 μM) on COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE2 formation by HPBMCs 
was therefore examined (Report 5197-130). Apremilast, added 1 hour prior to 20 hours of stimulation, 
increased COX-2 and PGE2 production by LPS- or phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated HPBMCs by 50% 
to 100%, demonstrating that apremilast enhanced, rather than inhibited, COX-2 expression in stimulated 
HPBMCs. However, apremilast (up to 100 μM), added to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
or platelets 1 hour prior to the 18-hour incubation with platelets or calcium ionophore A23187, 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 20/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
respectively, did not affect either prostacyclin or thromboxane production in the HUVEC/platelet 
co-culture system, or in calcium ionophore-stimulated platelets, indicating that apremilast does not 
modulate the eicosanoid production pathway in these cell types (Report 5299-148).  
Bone marrow mononuclear cells and normal human osteoblasts were incubated with apremilast at 
clinically relevant concentrations (0.1 - 1 μM) for 7 days (Report 7645-001). Apremilast significantly 
inhibited osteoclastogenesis at these concentrations. This effect was associated with a decrease in form of 
soluble receptor activator nuclear factor κ-B ligand (sRANKL) protein expression and an increase in BMP-6 
gene expression in the osteoclast cultures, an effect which was also observed in osteoblast cultures. 
Apremilast decreased the sRANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) protein ratio in both osteoclast and osteoblast 
cultures, and the effect was more pronounced in the osteoblasts. In contrast, positive controls rolipram, 
alendronate, and sulphasalazine had no effect on the sRANKL/OPG protein ratio, indicating that 
apremilast acts by a distinct mechanism.  
Comparative studies with other PDE4 inhibitors 
The activity of PDE4 inhibitors apremilast, cilomilast, and roflumilast was compared using rat, mouse, 
monkey, and human whole blood stimulated with LPS in vitro (Report 5265-117). After one hour of LPS 
stimulation, these inhibitors caused a dose-dependent elevation in IL-6 production from LPS-stimulated 
whole blood from mouse (3- to 5-fold) and rat (2- to 3-fold), but not from monkey or human whole blood. 
Apremilast, cilomilast, and roflumilast essentially had no effect on human IL-6 production, and partially 
inhibited monkey IL-6 production (maximum of 50%). In conclusion, the PDE4 inhibitors apremilast, 
cilomilast, and roflumilast had a qualitatively different effect on LPS-induced IL-6 production in vitro by 
the whole blood of rodents compared to that of primates and humans. These results indicate that rodents 
are more sensitive to PDE inhibitor-induced inflammatory response than primates and humans.  
Evaluation of antiproliferative effects 
Normal human lung fibroblast (NHLF) were incubated with apremilast (0.0001 - 100 µM) for 1 hour prior 
to the addition of LPS (1 ng/mL), TNF-α (10 ng/mL), or transforming growth factor- β 1 (TGF- β 1) (10 
ng/mL) for 24 or 48 hours, followed by 3H-thymidine incorporation for 24 or 48 hours (Report 5299-083). 
Apremilast displayed weak antiproliferative effects on NHLF in the 24-hour 3H-thymidine assay (IC50 
values >100 µM under LPS, TNF- α, or TGF-β1 stimulated conditions). The apremilast antiproliferative 
activity improved in the 48-hour assay with IC50 values of 92, 40 and 52 µM for the LPS, TNF- α, and 
TGF-β1 conditions, respectively.  
Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were treated for 1 hour with apremilast (0.00001 - 10 µM), followed by 
incubation with IL-1β (1 ng/mL), TNF- α (5 ng/mL), or IFN-γ (20 ng/mL) for 72 hours and then 
3H-thymidine incorporation for 6 hours (Report 5570-044). After HDFs were stimulated, apremilast 
displayed no observable antiproliferative effect on HDF survival in the concentration range tested (IC50 > 
10 µM). The effect appeared to be biphasic, with 30% enhancement at 0.1 µM but with proliferation 
returning to baseline at 10 µM. 
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is associated with fibroblast proliferation. In order to determine 
the effects of apremilast on PAI-1 production, HDFs were treated for 1 hour with apremilast (0.00001 - 10 
µM), followed by stimulation with rhIL-1β (1 ng/mL), rhTNF-α (5 ng/mL), or rhIFN-γ (20 ng/mL) for 24 
hours (Report 5570-044). Results from a human PAI-1 ELISA indicated that 10 µM apremilast displayed 
weak PAI-1 inhibitory effects achieving approximately 17% inhibition. However, at approximately 0.1 µM 
apremilast, the effect on PAI-1 expression and fibroblast proliferation started to decline (Report 
BSK-1073). 
Evaluation of antiangiogenic potential 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 21/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The effect of apremilast on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and intracellular signalling was examined 
(Report 5279-153). After 1-hour incubation with apremilast (0.001 - 100 µM), followed by stimulation 
with VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for 72 hours, apremilast inhibited VEGF-induced 
HUVEC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 6.7 µM, but was an 
ineffective inhibitor in the bFGF-induced proliferation assay. Also, apremilast (100 µM) displayed a 
significant inhibitory effect on Ser473-Akt phosphorylation but failed to block Akt phosphorylation at the 
Thr308 site. In the human angiogenesis assay, apremilast inhibited sprout formation from human 
umbilical cord blood vessels in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 = 0.14 µM (Report 
5127-132). Additionally, after 18 hours of LPS stimulation of HUVECs, apremilast (10 µM; 4.6 µg/mL) 
inhibited IL-1β-induced nitric oxide production by 87%, indicating a potential suppressive effect on nitric 
oxide synthase isozyme expression in endothelial cells (Report 5042-107). These results indicated that 
apremilast inhibits VEGF signalling and new blood vessel formation via endothelial cells, and block 
endothelial cell proliferation, and therefore may have an impact on angiogenic processes such as those 
that occur in PsA and PSOR (Coates, 2008b). 
The effect of apremilast on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and p53 tumor suppressor protein 
expression in HUVECs under hypoxic conditions was investigated (Report 5387-08). Time course results 
showed that HIF-1 α protein begins accumulating in approximately 30 minutes under hypoxic conditions, 
with maximum accumulation between 120 - 240 minutes. In HUVECs, apremilast inhibited the 
VEGF-induced VEGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (100 µM) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) phosphorylation. Also, apremilast (0.01 - 10 µM) inhibited HIF-1α protein expression in HUVECs 
under hypoxic conditions at 30 minutes and 2 hours within a range of 45% to 92%. Conversely, 
apremilast (0.1 - 10 µM) enhanced the p53 tumor suppressor protein expression ≈ 4-to 4.5-fold at the 
18-hour time point, which diminished slightly at the 36-hour time point to yield a 2.3- to 2.9-fold 
enhancement, suggesting that apremilast enhances p53 tumor suppressor protein expression for up to 36 
hours under hypoxic conditions. These findings illustrated the mechanism of apremilast antiangiogenic 
activity and its ability to enhance p53 tumor suppressor protein expression. 
Pharmacological Activity of the Metabolic Products of Apremilast 
In vivo, apremilast is converted to several metabolic products, including the hydrolysis degradants M1 
and M2, the O-desmethyl metabolite M3 (tested as racemate CC-15604 and S-isomer CC-16085, 
respectively), the O-desethyl metabolite M5, the N-deacetyl metabolite M7, the O-desmethyl glucuronide 
metabolite M12, the N-deacetyl O-desmethyl glucuronide metabolite M14, the 
acetamide-hydroxy-glucuronide M16 and the acetamide-hydroxy metabolite M17. The synthesized 
metabolites, including M12 isolated from human urine, were assayed for PDE4 enzyme activity and TNF-α 
production, and compared with the parent drug (Report 5275-179, Report 5347-137, Report 5424-75; 
Report 5638-96). Only the M7 and M17 metabolites (represented as CC-10055 and CC-16401, 
respectively), demonstrated potent inhibition of both PDE4 enzyme activity and TNF-α production, 
indicative of pharmacologically active apremilast metabolites (Report 5275-179; Report 5424-75), albeit 
less potent than apremilast. These data showed that the major circulating and excreted metabolites of 
apremilast are inactive or markedly less active towards the PDE4 enzyme and TNF- α production. The two 
pharmacologically active metabolites M7 and M17, account for less than 1% of the apremilast plasma 
exposure, and are not anticipated to contribute to the pharmacodynamics effects to a notable extent 
(Report CC-10004-PK-002). 
In Vivo Pharmacodynamic Activity of Apremilast 
Apremilast pharmacology was investigated in in vivo animal models of disease, including inflammatory 
and arthritis rodent models, psoriasis mouse models, UVB-stimulated SKH-1 hairless mice, and T and B 
cell adaptive transfer models. Antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory activity of apremilast was investigated

in LPS, carrageen, and collagen-induced models of disease in rodents. Psoriasis effects were determined 
in the human skin xenograft model in mice. The studies and the relevant findings are summarised in Table

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Apremilast (10 μM) was profiled for binding to 68 cell surface receptors and for inhibition of 17 enzymes 
(Report 8611). The results demonstrated that apremilast had no significant activity against any of the 
receptors or enzymes, except for 95% inhibition of PDE4, and 52% enhanced agonist binding of the 
L-type (verapamil) calcium channel receptor. However, results from a subsequent study (Report 
CC-10004-ET-151) confirmed that the 52% inhibition of the L-type (verapamil) calcium channel observed 
at 10 μM apremilast was a false positive hit. Kinase inhibition profiling of apremilast (10 μM) using 
Invitrogen's SelectScreen® Profiling Service demonstrated that the compound did not significantly inhibit 
any of the 255 kinases tested (Report SSBK8217-23649). 
Assessment of Apremilast Binding to Human Cereblon 
Human cereblon binding was investigated due to structural similarities between apremilast and 
thalidomide, namely the phthalimide moiety. The aminoglutarimide moiety which is responsible for 
thalidomide binding to cereblon is substituted for a di-alkoxyphenyl in apremilast. As cereblon binding is 
considered responsible for teratogenic effects associated with thalidomide, the comparative binding of 
apremilast to cereblon was investigated in competition studies of CRBN binding to thalidomide-analog 
affinity beads. Endogenous CRBN in human U266 MM cell extracts was incubated with varying 
concentrations of either apremilast, CC-5013 (lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog with an 
aminoglutarimide moiety) as a positive control for CRBN binding to the aminoglutarimide moiety, or 
dimethyl sulfoxide (1%) as the control vehicle. Apremilast at concentrations up to 100 μM did not 
compete for CRBN binding. In contrast, the positive control agent lenalidomide, successfully competed for 
CRBN binding with an IC50 value of approximately 3 μM. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in the Rat and Ferret 
Han Wistar rats were administered a single oral or intravenous dose of apremilast (1 mg/kg) and seven 
oral doses (10 mg/kg). The apremilast brain/plasma concentration ratio was ≤0.1, likely the result of 
apremilast being a P-glycoprotein substrate. Fasted ferrets received a single oral dose of apremilast (0.1 
- 30 mg/kg). Ferrets were exposed to apremilast, with a plasma half-life of 3.8 hours. Apremilast 
concentrations (1-hour) were highest in ferret lung, followed by plasma, and finally brain, with 
brain/plasma ratios ranging from 0.11 to 0.15, similar to those of rats, and lung/plasma ratios from 1.4 
to 3.5. A known pharmacological effect of PDE4 inhibitors is emesis (Robichaud, 1999). However, no 
emetic episodes were noted in ferrets dosed up to 3 mg/kg, and retching but no emesis in the 10-mg/kg 
dose group. The lack of emetic effects on ferrets is likely due to the poor penetration of apremilast across 
the blood/brain barrier. Additionally, apremilast inhibited pulmonary inflammation in the ferret as a result 
of higher apremilast concentrations in lung tissue. 
Effect of Apremilast on Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma B Cell Line  
When non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (Farage) cells were incubated with apremilast (0-100 µM) for 1 hour 
prior to the 6 hour 3H-thymidine assay, weak antiproliferative activity was observed (approximately 20% 
inhibition of proliferation at 100 µM).

Mouse Central Nervous System and Behavioral Studies Using the Irwin Screen 
A GLP-compliant Irwin study was performed in Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR mice to assess apremilast CNS safety 
following oral gavage administration of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg (Report 1398/443). Observations 
were performed up to 300 minutes post dose and general observations continued up to 7 days. At 1000 
mg/kg, apremilast produced signs of lacrimation and ptosis, which were slight in severity and of short 
duration, generally appearing 60 minutes post-dose and were gone by the 300 minutes timepoint. At 
2000 mg/kg clinical signs included apathy, lacrimation, and ptosis, occurring within the same time-frame 
as those effects seen at 1000 mg/kg, but persisting in one animal at 300 minutes post-dose. One animal 
in  the  2000  mg/kg  group  died  on  day  2.  Piloerection  was  seen  in  one  animal  at  day  2.  Toxicokinetic

parameters were not measured but are extrapolated from a previous study in Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR mice. At 
500,  1000  and  2000  mg/kg,  Cmax  values  of  8650;  9184;  and  11,940  ng/mL,  respectively.  The 
corresponding area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values were 112,640; 117,290; 
and 158,315 ng·h/mL. The NOEL level of 500 mg/kg provides 12.9 and 15.4 fold safety margin based on 
Cmax and AUC respectively, from the 30 mg BID clinical apremilast dose. 
Cardiovascular and Respiratory Effects in Anesthetized Dogs 
Cardiovascular and respiratory safety was determined in a GLP study in anesthetized dogs following 
intravenous administration of apremilast in ascending doses from 0.5 – 5 mg/kg (Report 
1398/264-D6146). 0.5 mg/kg elicited a small (9%) increase in left ventricular maximum rate of change 
(dP/dtmax) 2 min after dosing. This increase was sustained until administration of the next dose, and was 
significantly different from the vehicle treated group. This effect was not considered adverse. No other 
effects in cardiovascular parameters were apparent at this dose. At 1.0 mg/kg heart rate was significantly 
increased by 28% from 2 min after dosing and returned to baseline at 30 mins, and was reflected in 
decreased RR and QT intervals. Corrected QTc was not affected. dP/dtmax was also significantly  
increased by 29%, which also returned to baseline before subsequent doses. 5 mg/kg elicited further 
increases in heart rate of 82% from baseline and dP/dtmax to 74% from baseline 45 min post-dose. The 
tachycardia also resulted in corresponding decreases in the RR and QT intervals. QTc was not noticeably 
affected. These effects were statistically significant, and returned to baseline within 45 minutes. There 
was a small transient increase in mean arterial blood pressure that was not significant. 
There were no noticeable differences in the rate and depth (tidal volume) of respiration between the 
vehicle and test article treated groups at any dose level. However, apremilast elicited an apparent dose 
related increase in Peak Inspiratory Flow (from a baseline of 248 mL/s to 429 mL/s 90 min post-dose 3) 
and Peak Expiratory Flow (from a baseline of 330 mL/s to 461 mL/s 120 min postdose 3) throughout the 
duration of the study. Statistical analyses suggest that the increase in peak inspiratory flow was 
significantly different (10 and 60 min post-dose 3) from the vehicle treated group. 
Mean Cmax values (male and female combined) at 2 minutes after the end of infusions were 662, 1277, 
and 5074 ng/mL at dosages of 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg, respectively. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) was 0.5 mg/kg (mean Cmax value is 1-fold clinical Cmax of 670 ng/mL). There was no 
treatment-related effect on QTc interval up to and including the highest dose of 5 mg/kg, which provides 
a 7.6-fold safety margin from the clinical Cmax. 
Measurement of Ionic Currents in Cloned hERG Genes Expressed in Mammalian Cells 
Potential for effects on QTc parameters was investigated in a GLP in vitro hERG assay in voltage-clamped 
human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (Report 031206.DFN). Apremilast inhibited hERG current by 
(mean ± SEM) 6.3 ± 0.9% (n = 4) at 16.8 μM, 19.3 ± 1.4% (n = 3) at 49.7 μM, 28.5 ± 0.6% (n = 3) at 
87.5 μM, and 59.0 ± 1.7% (n = 4) at 249.7 μM; vehicle control reduced hERG current by 1.6 ± 0.3% (n 
= 3). The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of apremilast on hERG current was estimated to be 184.2 μM (84.8 
μg/mL); (Hill coefficient = 1.1); this represents a margin of 127-fold over the Cmax in psoriasis patients 
at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 30 mg BID. 
Effects on Gastrointestinal Motility in Mice 
A GLP-compliant study in mice was performed to determine the effects of oral apremilast on 
gastrointestinal motility in male CD-1 mice (Report CC-10004-TOX-1171). Animals were given 10, 100, 
and 1000 mg/kg. Approximately 30 minutes after vehicle or dose administration, all animals were given 
a charcoal suspension. Animals were euthanized by decapitation 30 minutes (± 3 minutes) following 
charcoal administration and the intestinal tract was quickly excised. The distance traveled by the charcoal 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 30/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
suspension was measured along with the total length of the small intestine to determine the effects of 
CC-10004 on gastrointestinal motility. A single oral (gavage) administration of CC-10004 to male 
Crl:CD-1 mice did not affect the percent distance traveled of the charcoal suspension or normalized 
percent inhibition of travel at 10, 100, or 1000 mg/kg. Based upon the lack of effect on gastrointestinal 
motility in this study, the No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) was 1000 mg/kg, the highest dose 
administered. Toxicokinetic parameters were not measured.

intracellular cAMP levels resulting in inhibition of cellular responses. The combination of PGE2 and 
apremilast dose-dependently and synergistically elevated cAMP levels in HPBMCs and neutrophils 
demonstrating enhanced PGE2-mediated elevation of cAMP in both HPBMCs and neutrophils. Apremilast 
was also found to inhibit GM-CSF production by normal human lung fibroblasts in a screen of 23 PDE4 
inhibitors. Apremilast in combination with forskolin inhibited TNF-α mediated GM-CSF production with an 
IC 50 of 0.12 µM.  
A study examining the effects of apremilast alone and in combination with PGE2 on TNF-α-induced 
E-selectin and other adhesion molecules expressed in HUVECs demonstrated that the apremilast/PGE2 
combination significantly inhibited TNF-α induced E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 
(VCAM-1). However even under TNF-α stimulated condition which serves to boost marker expression, the 
overall change in adhesion marker cell surface expression remains modest, and was generally similar to 
PGE2 alone. However, in the presence of PGE2, E-selectin, and VCAM-1 inhibition may be a potential 
apremilast mechanism of action as an antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory agent.  
In a study of apremilast in combination with indomethacin or methotrexate, apremilast was evaluated in 
the collagen-induced arthritis DBA/1 mouse model. Overall in this study, apremilast did not cause any 
antiarthritic effect when administered alone, despite the fact that some reductions in paw scores and 
measurements were noted. In a further mechanistic study, apremilast did not increase the percentage of 
IL-17 producing cells present in inguinal lymph nodes, but did increase IFNγ and IL-6 levels. 
The effects of combining apremilast with cyclosporine A (CsA), etanercept (ETC) or methotrexate (MTX) 
for the inhibition of cytokines associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis (Pso) was assessed 
in human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-stimulated T cells and staphylococcal enterotoxin B 
(SEB)-treated PBMCs. In the stimulated T cells derived from a donor with high cytokine levels, the 
combination effect of apremilast with CsA synergistically inhibited IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IP-10, MIP-1α, 
MIP-1β, and TNF-α production at a minimum of one of the tested concentrations. IL-4 was increased with 
the apremilast /CsA combination, whereas Il-2 production was decreased. The apremilast/ETC 
combination synergistically inhibited IFN-γ, IL-13, IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNF-α production at a 
minimum of one of the tested concentrations and non-additively inhibited IL-2 and IL-4 production. 
In the human NK cell-driven model of psoriasis utilizing human skin xenotransplanted onto 
immunodeficient mice, the combination of 1 mg/kg MTX with apremilast (5 mg/kg; PO divided into two 
daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg) exhibited a modest therapeutic effect in 2 of 5 mice. Recovery was improved in 
animals receiving 2 or 3 mg/kg MTX alone, however adverse effects were seen at the highest dose leading 
to death, whereas this was not seen in combination. Immunohistochemical staining for TNF-α also 
showed less TNF-α expression in combination treated tissue than control, and a similar level to tissue 
from mid/high dose MTX.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics of apremilast (S enantiomer) have 
been investigated in vitro and in vivo in the animal models used for toxicity testing. In vitro studies have 
been performed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions. No evidence of interconversion 
between apremilast and its R-enantiomer was observed in vivo. Appropriate achiral and chiral analytical 
methods were developed and suitably validated to quantify apremilast (S enantiomer), its R enantiomer 
(CC-10007), and its metabolites in plasma of animal models used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and 
toxicity studies. 
Absorption  
Pharmacokinetics, absorption and oral bioavailability of apremilast or [14C]-apremilast-derived 
radioactivity was evaluated in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.  
Mouse 
Following IV dosing plasma concentrations of apremilast declined steadily, falling below the limit of 
quantification by 12 h and 24 h in males and females respectively. AUC and T1/2 values indicate total 
radioactivity persisted, indicating persistent metabolism. Radioactivity was cleared more slowly in 
females. Following oral dosing at 500 mg/kg, apremilast was still quantifiable at 48 h with a longer t 1/2 
compared to iv doses. Concentrations of radioactivity were significantly higher than those of apremilast at 
each time point, consistent with the presence of metabolites. No significant sex-related differences were 
observed. Oral bioavailability ranged from approximately 20% to 33% for apremilast and for 
radioactivity. For both dose routes, concentrations of radioactivity in blood were consistently lower than 
those in plasma at the same time point, indicating that there was no specific association of apremilast or 
its metabolites with blood cells. 
In a bile-duct cannulated male mouse study following a single 10 mg/kg oral dose of [14C]-apremilast, 
54% and 16% of the radioactive dose was excreted via the biliary and urinary routes, suggesting that at 
least 70% of the radioactive dose was absorbed in mice, indicating apremilast is subject to moderate first 
pass metabolism. Toxicokinetic evaluation in mice suggests exposure increases dose-proportionally and 
less than dose-proportionally at doses over 100 mg/kg/day. The studies do not indicate sex-related 
differences or inversion of apremilast to its R enantiomer in mice. 
Rat 
Following IV dosing, plasma concentrations declined steadily in both males and females, but 
concentrations were below the limit of quantification by 8 h after dosing in males animals but still detected 
at 24 h in females. Sex differences in exposure were also reflected in the lower AUC and shorter t 1/2 
values in males compared with females, and systemic clearance was high in males and low in females. 
Following oral dosing at 50 mg/kg in males and 10 mg/kg in females, exposure was 6-fold greater in 
females. AUC values indicated oral bioavailability of 11.5% and 64.8% in males and females respectively. 
Similar sex differences in exposure were observed following IV or oral administration of CC-7085 
(racemate) or CC-10007 (R enantiomer) as compared to following administration of apremilast. 
In a second oral study, concentrations of both total radioactivity (e.g., parent compound plus any 
metabolites) and of parent compound in plasma were greater in females than in males. In males, the total 
radioactivity AUC values were 25 to 96 times greater than those for parent compound, whereas in females 
the difference was only 2- to 3-fold, suggesting that metabolism was more extensive in male than in 
female rats. In the same study following six daily doses, accumulation was indicated by Cmax and AUC 
values in females, but not in males. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 32/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In a study of the effect particle size in fasted, apremilast AUC and Cmax, as well as other pharmacokinetic 
parameters, were similar in rats dosed with micronized and milled drug substance indicating particle size 
does not affect the pharmacokinetics of apremilast in male rats. Measurement of apremilast’s R 
enantiomer indicated no chiral inversion occurs in rats. 
Rabbit 
In female New Zealand White rabbits following a single 1000 mg/kg oral dose, apremilast was rapidly 
absorbed. In pregnant female New Zealand White rabbits infused 10 mg/kg apremilast, following 
termination of infusion apremilast concentrations declined rapidly with a mean half-life of 1.2 h. The mean 
plasma clearance was high (2039 mL/h/kg), which is greater than 50% of the hepatic blood flow in 
rabbits. The volume of distribution was moderate (1843 mL/kg) and was approximately 2.5 times the 
total body water volume. Following a 250 mg/kg oral dose exposure was negligible, with a mean Cmax of 
2.62 ng/m and an absolute oral bioavailability of less than 0.02%. The AUC ratio of CC-10007 to 
apremilast was approximately 0.02, which is similar to the level in the administered dose. 
In a third study, 12 non-mated female New Zealand White rabbits were administered either 250 
mg/kg/day apremilast via stomach tube, 25 mg/kg/day apremilast via a 2-h IV infusion, 25 mg/kg/day 
apremilast via subcutaneous injection, or vehicle via a 2-h intravenous infusion for three days. Following 
IV administration to apremilast had a high clearance (> 3000 mL/h/kg) and large volume of distribution 
(> 3 L/kg). Exposure was minimal following oral dosing, with bioavailability less than 0.1%, compared to 
over 95% with subcutaneous dosing. The low exposure following oral dosing is consistent with in rabbit 
studies. 
Monkey 
Cynomolgus monkeys were administered a single IV dose of 1 mg/kg, followed by a washout and further 
oral dose of 10 mg/kg. Following IV dosing, concentrations of apremilast in plasma were significantly 
lower than those of total radioactivity at 5 and 10 min after dosing and had fallen below the lower limit of 
quantification (i.e., 75.0 ng/mL) within 30 min of dosing. Apremilast concentration data were insufficient 
to carry out pharmacokinetic analysis. The higher concentration of total radioactivity compared to 
apremilast and the much shorter half life of unchanged drug are consistent with extensive metabolism. 
Blood plasma concentration ratios for total radioactivity were generally in the region of 0.6:1 and did not 
change with time. This indicates that drug-related material moderately penetrated the blood cells. 
Following oral administration, bioavailability was estimated at 80% based on radioactivity, as IV 
apremilast exposure could not be quantified. Absorption appeared to be rapid, with Tmax reached within 1 
hour. There were no notable sex-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of apremilast in monkeys. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution in mice following oral and IV administration of [14C]-apremilast and plasma protein 
binding of apremilast were evaluated. Placental transfer of apremilast was evaluated in mice and the 
lacteal excretion in mice and monkeys. 
Tissue Distribution 
The tissue distribution of [14C]-apremilast-derived radioactivity in the male and female albino mice 
(CD-1 strain) and the male pigmented mouse (B6C3F1 strain) has been investigated. For tissue 
distribution, each animal received a single oral (gavage) dose, at nominal dose level of 500 mg/kg. The 
tissue distribution of the parent-derived radioactivity was evaluated by quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography at up to 168 hours post-dose. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 33/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Initial distribution was highest in the gastrointestinal mucosa, liver, kidney, and pancreas, with lower 
levels in the secretory glands and reproductive tissue in both males and females. Radioactivity was 
detected in the CNS in both males and females for up to 24 hours. In albino mice, by 72 h after dosing, 
levels had fallen below the lower limit of quantification (0.71 μg eq/g) except for the liver and, in males 
only, the kidney (cortex and medulla), skin, uveal tract, nasal mucosa, and gastrointestinal mucosa. 
Subjective assessment of the levels of radioactivity was made for those tissues where full quantification 
was not possible. Radioactivity was detected in the kidney pyramid up to 24 h after dosing and in the 
urinary bladder contents, gall bladder, esophagus, and gastrointestinal tract contents up to 72 h. 
Radioactivity was not detected in any tissues at 168 h after dosing or later. In pigmented mice, levels of 
radioactivity were elevated in the uveal tracts of the eyes compared to albino mice at 1 and 3 days 
post-dose. Low levels of radioactivity were observed in most tissues 3 days after dosing but levels were 
below the lower limit of quantification by 7 days post dose.  
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography demonstrated that the absorbed radioactivity was rapidly 
distributed into the tissues, although the concentrations measured were generally low. The highest levels 
of radioactivity were generally associated with the principal organs of biotransformation and excretion 
(e.g., the liver and kidney) and the pancreas. Significant levels of radioactivity were also present in the 
gall bladder up to 72 h after dosing, providing further evidence of biliary elimination. The concentrations 
measured in the central nervous system were consistently low, indicating that penetration of the 
blood/brain barrier was poor. The pattern of tissue distribution observed in male and female albino mice 
was generally similar at comparable sampling times. There was no significant association of radioactivity 
with melanin-containing tissues (e.g., uveal tract and pigmented skin) in pigmented male animals. 
In vitro Plasma Protein Binding 
Protein binding of apremilast was determined in vitro in plasma of mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey, human 
healthy volunteers and human plasma ultrafiltration. Protein binding of apremilast was conducted in 
triplicate at concentrations of 0.25, 0.75, and 2.5 μg/mL at room temperature, and analyzed using 
LC-MS/MS assay. The overall mean apremilast percent bound was 88.6 ± 2.3% in mouse plasma, 90.6 ± 
0.9% in rat plasma, 80.9 ± 1.2% in rabbit plasma, 84.3 ± 1.5% in monkey plasma, and 68.3 ± 0.9% in 
human plasma in the tested concentration range of 0.25 to 2.5 μg/mL. Overall, apremilast was 
moderately protein-bound in plasma of animals and human, and the binding was 
concentration-independent in the tested concentration range of 0.25 to 2.5 μg/mL. Plasma protein 
binding was lower in humans compared to animals. 
Placental Transfer 
As part of fertility and developmental toxicity study in female CD-1 mice and an embryo-fetal 
development study in cynomolgus monkeys, the transport of apremilast across the placenta was 
assessed. In mice, following daily oral administration of apremilast beginning 15 days prior to 
cohabitation and continuing through Day 15 of presumed gestation at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 
mg/kg/day, blood was collected from pregnant mice (n = 3/time point) at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postdose 
on gestation Day 15. Blood was collected from fetuses) at the time of sacrifice in the 24 h postdose mice. 
Maternal plasma apremilast concentrations increased in a less than dose proportional manner. The fetal 
plasma concentrations at 24 h were highly variable, with six of the ten litters evaluated being below the 
limit of quantification (1 ng/mL). In fetal plasma from four of the ten litters evaluated, apremilast was 
quantified, with concentrations ranging from 14.5 to 2813 ng/mL. The mean fetal-to-maternal plasma 
concentration ratios ranged from 0.3 to 1.07, indicating apremilast crossed the placenta in mice.   
In monkeys, pregnant animals were administered daily oral doses of apremilast beginning on gestation 
day 20 through gestation day 50, and a single oral dose on gestation day 100 at dosages of 20, 50, 200, 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 34/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and 1000 mg/kg/day (n = 16/group at the beginning of the study). Maternal and fetal blood was collected 
at 5 h postdose on gestation Day 100. In all dosage groups, the fetal-to-maternal plasma concentration 
ratios were between 0.3 and 0.4, indicating apremilast crossed the placenta in monkeys. 
Lacteal Excretion 
The lacteal excretion of apremilast was evaluated following oral administration of apremilast to lactating 
CD-1 mice. In this study, female mice approximately 13 days postpartum received a single oral dose of 
apremilast at 10 mg/kg, administered by oral gavage in a volume of 10 mL/kg. Milk and blood samples 
from 5 animals per time point were obtained at 1, 6, and 24 h postdose and apremilast concentrations 
determined in plasma and milk using LC-MS/MS analysis. The mean apremilast plasma concentrations at 
1 and 6 h postdose were 984 and 138 ng/mL, while concentrations in milk were 1441 and 186 ng/mL, 
respectively. The resulting mean milk-to-plasma ratios ranged from 1.46 to 1.62, indicating transfer of 
apremilast into milk in mice. Plasma and milk concentrations were below the detection limit of 3 ng/mL in 
the 24-h samples. 
Metabolism 
In vitro and in vivo metabolism of apremilast was investigated in mice, rats, female rabbits, monkeys and 
humans.  
Metabolism by Liver Microsomes 
This study was conducted to identify the in vitro metabolic pathways of [14C]-apremilast in male and 
female mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human liver microsomes.  
At 10 µM [14C]-apremilast the apparent rank order of extent of apremilast metabolism was rabbit >> 
monkey > mouse = male rat > human > dog > female rat. No sex differences were observed in any 
species except rat.  The major metabolite of both apremilast and CC-10007 in human liver microsomes 
was M3 (10% of radioactivity). M7 (1.8%) was identified in the absence of β-NADPH suggesting no 
CYP450 involvement. 
The major metabolite, M3, observed in all test incubations, with the notable exception of female rat, was 
identified as the O-desmethyl metabolite. A sex difference in metabolism was therefore apparent in rat. 
M3 was the only CYP-dependent metabolite observed in dog, human, and male rat. An additional 
metabolite, M5, was observed in mouse and monkey, which co-chromatographed with the O-desethyl 
metabolite reference standard CC-10047. A number of other minor metabolites, M4, M8, M9, and M10, 
were observed in rabbit, in addition to M7.  
The N-deacetylated product (M7) was formed to a minor extent in the absence of NADPH in mouse, dog 
and human liver microsomal incubations, and to a greater extent in the presence of rabbit liver 
microsomes. It appears that this non-CYP mediated hydrolysis of the amide bond is favourably catalyzed 
by rabbit liver microsomes compared to other species. 
Metabolism by Hepatocytes 
In vitro metabolism of [14C]-apremilast was investigated in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human 
hepatocytes.  
[14C]-apremilast was not stable in the incubation media. After 4-hr incubation without hepatocytes, only 
69.0-73.2% of [14C]-CC-10004 remained unchanged. Significant hydrolysis products M1/M2 and M18 
were observed, accounting for 13.3-13.9% and 11.6-13.0%, respectively. In addition, multiple minor 
radioactivity peaks were also present in the negative control samples, accounting for 1.9-4.1%. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 35/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
[14C]-apremilast was metabolized extensively by rabbit hepatocytes, moderately by rat hepatocytes, and 
to a limited extent by hepatocytes from the mouse, dog, monkey, and human. Unchanged 
[14C]-apremilast and 12 metabolite peaks (M1/M2, M3, M4, M7, M11, M12, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, 
and M23) were characterized and/or identified by LC-MS/MS, production scan, and/or MS/MS in the MRM 
mode. M1/M2 and M18 showed a similar or lower percent of the total radioactivity in all hepatocyte 
incubations compared to the negative control sample. A high concentration of M14 was observed in rabbit 
hepatocyte incubations, accounting for 25.4% to 29.7% of the total radioactivity. A much lower amount 
of M14 was observed, ranging from 0.8% to 2.6% of the total radioactivity in the hepatocyte incubations 
of the other five species. M3, M7, and M12 were observed in the hepatocyte incubations of all species. The 
other minor metabolites showing detectable radioactivity were M4 (in mouse, rat, and rabbit hepatocyte 
incubations), M15 (in rat, rabbit and monkey hepatocyte incubations), M16 (in mouse, rat, and human 
hepatocyte incubations), and M17 (in mouse, rat, and human hepatocyte incubations). Some metabolites 
were present at very low levels and were detectable by only LC/MS. Overall, all the metabolites formed in 
vitro by human hepatocytes were formed by hepatocytes from one or more animal species. 
In Vitro Juvenile Metabolism in Mice and Humans 
[14C]-Apremilast was hydrolyzed in control incubations without microsomes or hepatocytes to produce 
M1 and M2 (hydrolysis products), as well as M18 (3-acetamide-phthalic acid). Metabolites identified in 
human microsomes and hepatocytes included M3, M7, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15 and M17. There were no 
notable qualitative differences between the metabolite profiles in the adult human liver microsomes 
(pooled mixed gender) versus the juvenile male and juvenile female liver microsomes. Similarly, for 
human cryopreserved hepatocytes, there were no notable differences observed between the adult 
(pooled mixed gender) versus juvenile male and female hepatocytes. In adult and juvenile mouse liver 
microsomes there were no notable differences between the profiles generated, except for M7, which was 
formed by adult to a very minor extent. 
In Vivo Metabolism  
In vivo metabolism was evaluated in mice, rats and monkeys and to a limited extent in female rabbits.  
Mouse 
In mice following oral dosing, metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar in plasma, urine and faeces. In 
plasma at the early time points, apremilast was the largest peak (except in females after oral dosing). At 
the later time points, the proportion of radioactivity associated with parent compound decreased, with a 
corresponding increase in that associated with metabolites. Hydrolysis products M1 and M2 were the 
major components of plasma radioactivity. Metabolite M15 metabolite was also present at significant 
amounts. Parent drug was higher in faeces following oral doses than IV doses. In orally dosed 
males/females excreted dose was accounted for by 5.6%/7.2% of M1/M2, 8.4%/6.2% of M3, 
14.4%/12.6% of M9, 0.9%/0.5% of M12, 5.3%/5.2% of M19 and 2.2%/7.0% of M22. 
In bile duct cannulated mice following 10 mg/kg oral or 5/10 mg/kg IV doses unchanged apremilast and 
M12 were the major plasma components as well as M13, M14 and trace metabolites. Bile was the major 
excretion route with 53.9% and 59.1% of dose recovered from oral and IV groups at 48 h. The major 
biliary metabolites were M12 and M13, accounting for approximately 30% and 10% of the dose, 
respectively. An average of 15.1% and 17.8% of dose was recovered in urine with M12 and M13 the most 
abundant. An average of 15.6% and 10.5% of the dose was recovered in faecal samples at 48 h with 
parent drug and M3 present at the highest levels. The study indicates apremilast absorbed following an 
oral dose is extensively metabolized prior to elimination and primarily excreted via the biliary route. 
Rat

Following oral administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]-apremilast, little or no apremilast was observed in male 
rats. The principle metabolite in male rats was not identified, and M12 was a major plasma component, 
which were both also present in females as well as M1/M2 which was predominant. In urine the profiles 
were similar in both sexes. The principle metabolite was M12. The principle metabolite in faeces was M3 
in both sexes, although present at higher levels in males. Other notable metabolites in rat excreta include 
M5, M7, M8, and M9, representing 0.36% to 8.59% of the radioactive dose. 
Rabbit 
Following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg, the plasma levels of apremilast was below the limit of detection. No 
metabolites were detected. One animal’s plasma gave mass spectra consistent with a glucuronic acid 
conjugate of O-desmethyl-apremilast. 
Monkey 
Apremilast was the predominant component of the circulating radioactivity at the early time point but 
decreased with time, while metabolites were the major components at 24 h postdose. The metabolites 
observed in plasma include M1, M2, and M12, in addition to two polar metabolites (MkP2 and MkP3), 
which could not be identified due to interference from high levels of endogenous material. Two other 
minor metabolites were identified as the two isomers of M15 (O-desmethyl hydrolyzed apremilast 
glucuronide). Little or no apremilast was excreted in urine. The major urinary metabolite was M12. Only 
low levels of unchanged apremilast were present in faeces, even after oral dosing. The principle 
metabolites in faeces were M3 and two isomers of M9. Minor metabolites were identified as M19 and M10. 
Excretion 
The rates and routes of excretion of radioactivity after IV and/or oral administration of [14C]-apremilast 
was evaluated in mouse with and without bile duct cannulation, rats and monkeys. The recovery data are 
summarised in table 5 below.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies have been conducted to examine the role of CYP isozymes in the oxidative metabolism of 
apremilast. The potential inhibitory and inductive effects of apremilast on CYP activities in vitro were also 
evaluated. Apremilast was also evaluated in vitro as a potential inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Additionally apremilast was evaluated as a potential inhibitor of 
MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 and MRP8 in vitro. 
Cytochrome P450 Reaction Phenotyping 
In human liver microsomes, [14C]-apremilast was metabolized to four products, designated as M1, M2, 
M3, and M5. Metabolites M3 and M5 were not produced to an appreciable extent in the absence of NADPH, 
indicative of the involvement of CYP enzymes. The apparent Km values for M3 and M5 were high (199 and 
194 μM, respectively) suggesting that [14C]-apremilast has a relatively low affinity for these isozyme. 
Following incubations with cDNA expressed human P450 isoforms, CYP3A4 was found to be capable of 
efficiently metabolizing apremilast to M3, and CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 to a small extent. Apremilast was 
metabolised to M5 predominantly by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 and to some extent by CYP1A2.  
Marked inhibition of the formation of M3 and M5 was observed following incubation in the presence of the 
selective CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (59% for M3, 104% for M5). These data generally support the 
data generated with recombinant CYP3A4, confirming that apremilast metabolism was mediated via 
CYP3A4 to a major extent. Notable inhibition was also observed for M3 and M5 for furafylline (CYP1A2), 
M5 for 8-methoxypsoralen (CYP2A6), and to a lesser extent, monoclonal anti-CYP2E1, sulphaphenazole 
(CYP2C9), and tranylcypromine (CYP2C19). 
In summary, the results of the present study indicate that the metabolism of [14C]-apremilast is 
mediated predominantly by CYP3A4, although other isozymes, such as CYP1A2 and CYP2A6, may 
contribute to a lesser extent to the metabolism. 
Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 
Studies were conducted to investigate the inhibitory and time-dependent effects of apremilast on selected 
P450 activities in human liver microsomes. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit marker enzyme 
activities for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 at any 
concentration evaluated. Apremilast was a weak direct inhibitor of CYP2C8, estimated half-maximal 
inhibition (IC50) of 56.1 μM. Based on these in vitro results and the plasma concentrations of apremilast 
observed at clinically relevant doses, apremilast is unlikely to cause drug-drug interactions due to enzyme 
inhibition when coadministered with substrates of these CYP isoforms. 
Induction of Cytochrome P450 
The potential for apremilast to act as an inducer of CYP enzymes was evaluated in primary cultures of 
human hepatocytes with subsequent determinations of microsomal CYP activities. Under the conditions of 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 38/189 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
this study, treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with prototypical inducers caused the anticipated 
increases in CYP activity. Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with apremilast at 10 and 100 μM 
caused a concentration-dependent decrease in microsomal 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP1A2) and 
diclofenac 4′-hydroxylase (CYP2C9) activity. The decrease in CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity was 35% at 10 
μM apremilast, and 45% to 73% at 100 μM. In general, treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with 
apremilast had little or no effect on CYP2B6 or CYP2C19 activity. However, for CYP2B6, there was a trend 
toward an increase in activity, and in the case of CYP2C19, there was a concentration-dependent 
decrease in two cultures and a concentration-dependent increase in the third culture. Treatment of 
cultured human hepatocytes with apremilast caused an increase (3.7-fold) in testosterone 
6β-hydroxylase (CYP3A4) activity, and the increase was statistically significant at the highest 
concentration (100 μM apremilast). At 100 μM, apremilast was about half as effective as rifampin at 
inducing CYP3A4 activity. 
Apremilast had no effects on CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 at 1 μM; treatment at higher concentrations caused 
35% (10 μM) and up to 70% (100 μM) decreases in CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities. There was no effect 
on CYP3A4 activities at 1 and 10 μM apremilast. A 3.7-fold induction of CYP3A4 (roughly half the extent 
induced by rifampin) was observed at 100 μM. However, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant 
because 100 μM is approximately 70-fold higher than observed Cmax of apremilast in psoriasis patients 
following 30 mg BID dosing (approximately 1.5 μM). 
Interaction with P-glycoprotein 
The intrinsic permeability of apremilast and its interaction with xenobiotic transporter P-gp as a substrate 
and as an inhibitor were assessed in control and human P-gp expressing LLC-PK1 cell lines. The 
determined intrinsic apparent permeability (Papp) value was 21 x 10-6 cm/sec across native LLC-PK1 
monolayer following a 120-minute incubation, which is considered moderate. Bidirectional permeability 
determinations in control and P-gp-expressing cells demonstrated that apremilast was transported by 
P-gp, based on net efflux ratio of 27 (after 120-minute incubation). The transport activity of 10 μM 
apremilast was assessed in the absence and presence of ketoconazole, a known inhibitor of P-gp. 
Ketoconazole inhibited apremilast transport by 92%. These results further support the evidence that 
apremilast is actively transported by P-gp. 
Apremilast was evaluated as an inhibitor of P-gp. The results demonstrated that apremilast has no 
significant inhibitory effect on the transport of P-gp substrate digoxin at apremilast concentrations ≤ 20 
μM, and could potentially be a weak inhibitor at ≥ 50 μM (less than 50% inhibition at 50 μM). At the 
highest planned clinical dose of 30 mg, concentrations of apremilast could reach 260 μM (30 mg/250 mL) 
in the intestine. The resulting ratio of apremilast concentration (260 μM) to P-gp IC50 (> 50 μM) is <5, 
suggesting apremilast is unlikely to significantly inhibit P-gp in the gastrointestinal tract (Zhang, 2008). 
Interaction with Other Drug Transporters 
Apremilast had little or no inhibition of OAT1- or OAT3-mediated uptake at the 2 and 10 µM. At up to 20 
μM, apremilast did not inhibit BCRP-, MRP1-, MRP2-, MRP4-, OCT2-, or OATP1B3-mediated transport. 
Weak inhibition (< 30%) of MRP3 (at 2 and 20 μM apremilast) and OATP1B1 (at 20 μM apremilast) was 
observed, but is unlikely to result in clinically relevant inhibition of these transporters. Apremilast did 
inhibit MRP8-mediated transport, with 42.7% and 59.8% inhibition, at 2 and 20 μM, respectively. The 
clinical relevance of this inhibition is unclear because the role of MRP8 in drug disposition is not clearly 
understood.  
In studies to determine whether apremilast is a substrate for a range of transporters in relevant cell lines, 
bidirectional permeability and/or cleared volume data indicated apremilast is not a substrate for BCRP, 
OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT2.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety program of apremilast (CC-10004) consisted of single-dose toxicity studies in mice 
and rats (oral and intravenous), a series of repeat-dose toxicity studies for dosing durations up to 6 
months in mice and 12 months in monkeys, genotoxicity core battery studies (in vitro Ames and 
chromosome aberration and in vivo micronucleus assays), carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats 
including 3-month maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies to select the dosages for 2-year 
carcinogenicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mice and monkeys, and local 
tolerance studies. A study to compare the toxicity profiles of S enantiomer (apremilast) and R enantiomer 
(CC-10007) in rats was also conducted. In addition, a mechanistic study was conducted to investigate the 
time course for development and recovery of inflammatory lesions observed in multiple tissues of mice 
and to examine potential biomarkers for proinflammation response. The phototoxicity potential of 
apremilast was assessed in an in vitro assay in 3T3 fibroblast cells. A dosage-range-finding study and a 
pivotal 13-week toxicity study in juvenile mice were also conducted.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The mouse and monkey were selected as the rodent and non-rodent species for the embryo-fetal 
development evaluation. The monkey was selected due to a lack of measurable exposure to apremilast in 
rabbits after oral administration. The mouse was used as the species to assess fertility and mating and 
pre- and postnatal development based on the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile which is more similar 
to humans.

Two-Week Oral (Gavage) Dosage Range Finding Repeated-Dose Toxicity Study of apremilast in Neonatal 
Mice (Non-GLP) 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 53/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Apremilast was administered by oral gavage to neonatal male and female mice (8/sex/group) at 0, 10, 
100, and 1000 mg/kg/day on Days 7 through 20 postpartum (DPs 7 through 20). Mortality occurred in all 
pups at 1000 mg/kg/day, 7 out of 8 pups per sex in the 100 mg/kg/day group, and 2 male pups in the 10 
mg/kg/day group. Clinical observations included increased incidence of dehydration at ≥10 mg/kg, thin 
body condition (≥10 mg/kg/day females and 100 mg/kg/day males), and cold bodies and decreased 
motor activity at ≥100 mg/kg/day. Consistent body weight loss prior to death occurred in the 1000 
mg/kg/day group. The surviving pups in the 100 mg/kg/day dosage group tended to gain weight after DP 
10. Body weight gain in the 10 mg/kg/day dosage group was reduced after the first two dosages (DPs 7 
to 8 and 8 to 9) and then generally comparable to control group values after DP 10. Average body weights 
on DP 21 were 8% and 46% below control and 17% and 43% below control for males and females in the 
10 and 100 mg/kg/day dosage groups, respectively. There were no test article-related macroscopic 
findings.  
Dose-limiting toxicity was clearly established at 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day based on mortality on DP 9-12. 
Thirteen-Week Oral (Gavage) Repeated-Dose Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of Apremilast in Juvenile 
Mice (GLP) 
Apremilast was administered orally (via gavage) to juvenile male and female mice (30/group) at dosage 
levels of 0 (1% w/v aqueous CMC), 1, 4, and 10 mg/kg/day on postnatal days (PNDs) 7 through 97. Totals 
of 6, 6, 9 and 17 mice in the 0, 1, 4 and 10 mg/kg/day dosage groups, respectively, were found dead, 
missing, or sacrificed due to adverse signs during the dosage period, predominantly over the first week of 
dosing. At 4 mg/kg/day, 5 of 9 deaths were attributed to traumatic injury and 3 were missing and 
presumed cannibalized. 
Apremilast was associated with mild/moderate dehydration in females at ≥4 mg/kg/day and males at 10 
mg/kg/day. Decreased activity was also seen in females at ≥10 mg/kg/day. Body weights were generally 
decreased with apremilast at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day from PND 7 to 14 but a compensatory increase in body 
weight gain was seen from PND 22 onwards, and the changes were not considered adverse. 
Sexual maturation was slightly delayed for male and female pups in the 10 mg/kg/day dosage group and 
the average day on which preputial separation occurred was significantly increased in this group. Delays 
were within historical controls and were related to body weight gain and therefore not considered 
adverse. Clinical pathology revealed increased lymphocytes in females at ≥4 mg/kg/day of up to 1.8 fold 
at the end of the dosing phase. 
There were no apremilast-related effects on motor activity, functional observational battery, Morris water 
maze performance, mating, fertility or Caesarean-sectioning parameters, femur lengths, organ weights, 
necropsy, or histopathological observations.  
Generally, administration of apremilast was considered to be well tolerated in male and female juvenile 
mice. The NOAEL was considered to be 10 and 4 mg/kg/day in males and females respectively, 
corresponding to AUCs of 7470 and 2990 ng•hr/mL on PNDs 7 and 21, respectively for females, and 
13600 and 5270 ng•hr/mL on PNDs 7 and 21, respectively, for males.

Dermal Irritation 
Acute Dermal Irritation Study in Rabbits of CC-10004 in Ethanol:Propylene Glycol (non-GLP)

Page 54/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Apremilast was evaluated for its potential dermal irritation and/or corrosive effects by dermal application 
to 3 New Zealand White rabbits at a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL in ethanol:propylene glycol (40:60 
%v/v) (Report CC-10004-TOX-500). Hair on the dorsal trunk of the rabbits was removed and 0.5 mL of 
the test article was applied and held on the skin for 4 hours. The test site was scored for erythema/eschar 
formation and edema within 30 to 60 minutes and at 24 and 48 hours following patch removal. All animals 
survived to study termination and there was no effect on body weights. There was no observed 
erthema/eschar or edema formation; therefore, apremilast was classified as a non-irritant. 
Skin Sensitization Study (Buehler Method) in Guinea Pigs of CC-10004 in Ethanol:Propylene Glycol 
(non-GLP) 
A total of 2 males and 2 females were assigned to the range-finding phase, and the test article was 
administered to 4 dose sites on shaved dorsal trunk/scapular region of each animal at dose levels of 0 
(ethanol:propylene glycol; 40:60 %v/v), 0.05, 0.5, and 3.0 mg/mL (Report CC-10004-TOX-501). Closed 
topical patches were applied as 0.4 mL liquid. No signs of irritation were observed at 24 and 48 hours after 
dose application; therefore, a concentration of 3.0 mg/mL was selected for the definitive skin 
sensitization phase of the study.  
In the definitive skin sensitization study, guinea pigs were assigned to apremilast (10/sex), vehicle 
control (5/sex) or hexylcinnamic aldehyde (HCA; positive control; 5/sex) groups. During the induction 
phase, animals in the apremilast or positive control groups received topical patch applications (0.4 mL) of 
their respective drugs for 6 hours once weekly for 3 weeks. The challenge phase occurred 2 weeks after 
the last induction application. The test or vehicle control article was applied topically to the animals in the 
vehicle control and the apremilast groups, and the HCA was given similarly to the positive control animals. 
The application sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours after the challenge application. 
No signs of irritation were observed in any of the animals in the apremilast groups. No animals in the 
vehicle control group had positive signs of irritation but 3 animals had equivocal signs of irritation. The 
positive control group also responded in an equivocal manner. Based on these equivocal results, the 
apremilast and positive control animals were rechallenged along with a group of previously untreated 
control animals. 
In the rechallenge phase, positive signs of irritation were observed in 1 of 20 animals in the apremilast 
group at 48 hours scoring. This resulted in a sensitization index of 5% (weak sensitizer). No signs of 
irritation were observed in the vehicle control group. The positive control group responded in an 
appropriate manner, with 70% of the animals observed with erythema scores of 1 or greater (strong 
sensitizer). 
Immunotoxicity 
No specific immunotoxicity studies were conducted with apremilast. In the single- and multiple-dose 
general toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, effects of apremilast on the immune system were 
largely limited to inflammatory changes associated with vasculitis in rodents. This pro-inflammatory 
effect observed in rodents is a known class effect of PDE4 inhibitors and is considered less relevant to 
humans. In contrast, studies in monkeys revealed no convincing microscopic evidence of 
apremilast-related tissue inflammation. No consistent hematological evidence of inflammation was seen. 
Although neutrophilia and lymphopenia were cited in some monkey studies, including the 12-month 
chronic study, these changes were negligible in magnitude and/or within the range of pretest values. No 
toxicologically-significant changes in inflammatory markers were seen in the blood of monkeys dosed 
with apremilast on any study. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 55/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Aside from the rodent-predominant pro-inflammatory changes, there is little evidence from standard 
toxicity studies for immunotoxic potential of apremilast. Although mildly decreased peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and lymphoid atrophy/depletion in lymph nodes, spleen and/or thymus were seen in rodents 
administered apremilast, these findings were associated with inflammatory lesions and are consistent 
with normal physiologic responses of lymphocytes to inflammation and stress, rather than a direct 
lymphotoxic effect of the drug. In monkeys, alterations in lymphoid parameters were far lower in 
incidence and severity, and definitive apremilast-related inflammatory lesions were not observed. 
Lymphoid atrophy was seen in monkeys only at the highest dose tested (750 mg/kg) after 2 weeks. No 
evidence of effects on either lymphoid organ weights or histology was seen at doses up to 650 mg/kg and 
for study durations as long as 12 months. Although decreased peripheral lymphocytes were cited in the 
12-month monkey study, effects were minimal and not considered toxicologically meaningful or 
associated with lymphoid atrophy in tissues. Immunophenotyping was conducted during this study and 
revealed no definitive apremilast-related effects. A statistically significant effect on T cells and NK cells 
was observed in males during Week 13; however, significance was no longer evident by Week 51 and a 
similar change was not seen in females, thus a causative relationship of this minor effect to apremilast 
administration could not be made. 
There were no increased incidences of opportunistic infections or tumours in any of the completed 
toxicology studies. In clinical studies, vasculitis has not been associated with apremilast treatment. There 
were no notable changes in clinical laboratory tests or peripheral blood markers of inflammation 
monitored in the Phase II clinical studies.  
Metabolites 
In vivo, apremilast is converted to several metabolic products, including the hydrolysis degradants M1 
and M2, the O-desmethyl metabolite M3 (tested racemate CC-15604 and S isomer CC-16085, 
respectively), the O-desethyl metabolite M5, the N-deacetyl metabolite M7, the O-desmethyl 
glucuronidated metabolite M12, the N-deacetylated-O-desmethylated glucuronide M14, the 
acetamide-hydroxy-glucuronide M16, and the acetamide-hydroxy metabolite M17. The synthesized 
metabolites, including M12 isolated from human urine, were assayed for PDE4 enzyme and TNF-α 
production inhibitory activities and compared to the parent drug (Report 5275-179; Report 5347-137; 
Report 5424-75; Report 5638-96). Only the M7 and M17 metabolites (represented as CC-10055 and 
CC-16401) demonstrated potent inhibition of both PDE4 enzyme activity and TNF-α production, indicative 
of pharmacologically active apremilast metabolites. These data showed that the major circulating and 
excreted metabolites of apremilast are inactive or markedly less active towards the PDE4 enzyme and 
TNF-α production. The two pharmacologically active apremilast metabolites, M7 and M17, account for less 
than 1% of the circulating radioactivity in humans and are not anticipated to contribute to the 
pharmacodynamic effects to a notable extent. Based on the observation that O-demethylation is a major 
metabolic pathway in human, levels of M3 and M12 were measured in the chronic mouse and monkey 
studies.  
Studies on impurities 
The only specified impurities for the apremilast drug substance (DS) and drug product (DP) are RC6 and 
RC8. RC6 is also a minor metabolite (M7) in humans and animals, and it was present in the batches used 
for a number of the pivotal toxicology studies, including the 26-week mouse, 52-week monkey, and the 
mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 56/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
An in silico evaluation using the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) genotoxicity predictive 
tools showed that there was no potential genotoxic structural alert for RC8; however, the RC6 impurity 
contains a structural alert for potential mutagenicity. Therefore, RC6 was evaluated for its mutagenic 
potential in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay described below (Report CC-10004-TOX-015) and 
the results of the assay were negative. Per ICH Q3A Guidance (2002), the levels of these impurities are 
set to be below the qualification threshold of 0.15%. 
The mutagenic potential of apremilast spiked with 5% w/w CC-10055 (RC6 impurity of apremilast) was 
investigated in a bacterial reverse mutation assay using 4 Salmonella typhimurium tester strains (TA98, 
TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA in the presence and absence of 
Aroclor-induced rat liver (S9) at 1.5 to 5000 µg/plate apremilast with 5.5% RC6 impurity (250 µg RC6 at 
maximum concentration). No positive response was seen at up to 5000 µg/plate, but precipitate was seen 
at 5000 µg/plate. Under the conditions of this study, apremilast spiked with 5% w/w CC-10055 was 
concluded to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay with all of the tester strains in the 
absence and presence of S9. 
Other studies 
Oral (Gavage Administration) Comparative Toxicity Study of Apreimilast R and S enantiomers in the 
Female Rat  
A study of the relative toxicity of the apremilast (S enantiomer) and CC-10007, its R enantiomer, in the 
female rat at an oral dose of 50 mg/kg/day indicated marked differences in. CC-10007 is 8-fold less 
potent than CC-10004 for PDE4 enzyme inhibition, with an IC50 of 0.611 µM (Report 5042-107). Following 
the 14 days of dosing, there was no indication of adverse effects with CC-10007; therefore, surviving 
animals in that group were dosed for an additional 16 days for a total of 30 days. All animals given 
apremilast were euthanized on Day 3 after only 2 doses following marked weight loss and reduction in 
food consumption, and poor general condition. Macroscopic examination was not performed on these 
animals at necropsy. In the CC-10007 group, one rat was terminated on Day 10 due to poor condition of 
swollen abdomen, pallor and staining of the urogenital region; macroscopic examination was not 
performed. Swollen abdomen was also observed in 7 out of 9 surviving animals in this group; this was first 
observed on Day 11 but was no longer present by Day 17. There were no CC-10007 effects on body 
weight, food consumption or macroscopic necropsy findings in the surviving animals. Limited 
toxicokinetic sampling showed that each enantiomer was systemically absorbed following its oral 
administration to female rats. 
Evaluation of Biomarkers for Predicting Toxicity of Apremilast in Rat 
The objective of this study was to develop a biomarker profile over time that could be used to follow the 
development and recovery of toxicity induced by apremilast in rats. Female rats (25/group) were dosed 
orally at a dose volume of 5 ml/kg with vehicle or 10 mg/kg/day of apremilast for 7 consecutive days 
followed by an 11-day recovery period. On Days 3, 6, 8 (recovery day 1), 14, and 18, five animals each 
from the apremilast and vehicle-treated groups were euthanized and blood, tissue and peritioneal lavage 
samples were collected for analysis. Results were consistent with the 90 day repeat dose toxicity study in 
rats, with GI clinical signs, hypoactivity, body weight loss, haematology and serum chemistry changes, 
and histopathological changes in mesentery thymus and small intestine. 
Plasma biomarkers that correlated with the onset of the inflammation included an increase in fibrinogen, 
CRP, lipase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 and 
macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and decreases in leptin, MDC, and von Willebrand Factor 
(vWF). In addition, a significant increase in neutrophils and changes in biomarkers (increases in 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 57/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
fibrinogen, haptoglobin, VEGF, IgA, vWF, IL-11, and MCP-1 and decreases in leptin and RANTES [also 
known as chemokine ligand 5]) were observed in the peritoneal lavage samples of apremilast-treated 
rats. 
Oral Toxicity Study in Mice to Investigate the Time Course for Development and Recovery of 
Inflammatory Lesions in Multiple Tissues  
Apremilast was administered via oral gavage to female mice (36/group) once daily 1000 mg/kg/day for 
either 90 days, or 300 and 100 mg/kg/day for 14 days with a further 31 day or 76 day recovery period.  
Five animals (2 at 300 mg/kg/day and 3 at 1000 mg/kg/day) died or were euthanized in extremis before 
their scheduled necropsies. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations revealed the possible cause of death 
as gavage trauma for 2 animals and stress for 1 animal; no specific causes were evident in the remaining 
2 early mortalities. Deaths were not considered treatment-related. 
Body weights were increased prior to recovery at d13, and persisted in animals treated for 90 days. 
Higher globulin and urea nitrogen levels and lower A/G ratio were noted in all apremilast-treated groups 
at day 14. There were no clinical observations or haematology findings. Histological lesions were 
observed in the thymus and mesenteric lymph nodes (300 and 1000 mg/kg/day) and liver (1000 
mg/kg/day). Thymic lesions reversed following 31-day recovery. All changes in mesenteric lymph nodes 
were resolved on Day 90 regardless of continued dosing or a 76-day recovery period. At 1000 mg/kg/day, 
liver lesions (hepatocellular hypertrophy) were observed with continuous dosing for 3, 14 and 45 days; 
complete recovery occurred by Day 90 with continued treatment or a 76-day recovery period. 
Photoxicity study - Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay of CC-10004 in Balb/c 3T3 Mouse Fibroblasts 
Apremilast was evaluated for its phototoxicity potential by measuring the relative reduction in viability of 
Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts exposed to apremilast and ultraviolet radiation (+UVR), as compared with 
the viability of fibroblasts exposed to apremilast in the absence of ultraviolet radiation (-UVR). Results 
from this study showed that apremilast, at up to 101.8 mg/L, the highest achievable concentration in 1% 
DMSO in DPBS, demonstrated no cytotoxic effect (absence of UVR exposure) or phototoxic effect (with 
UVR exposure) in the assay by either the Photo Inhibition Factor or Mean Phototoxic Effect criteria. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Apremilast is currently being developed for use in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory 
conditions such as PsA, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Behçet’s disease (BD), and ankylosing 
spondylitis. The current ERA covers the indications psoriasis and PsA.  
The partition coefficient (n-octanol/water) for Apremilast was experimentally determined by the shake 
flask method (comparable to OECD Test Method 107). The resulting log Kow value of Apremilast was 1.77 
and hence is below 4.5 (i.e. logKow = 1.77). Therefore, Apremilast cannot be identified as a persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or a very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance. The 
estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) has been based on a refined market 
penetration factor (F pen = 0.0342), and a maximum daily dose of 60 mg. The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of 
Apremilast (1.03 μg/L) exceeds the action limit of 0.01μg/L, triggering a Phase II environmental fate and 
effects assessment.

Entry into the groundwater is considered via bank filtration. Exempted for groundwater assessment are 
substances with an average Koc >10,000 L/kg or which are readily biodegradable and/or have a DT90 <3 
days. Since Apremilast has a Koc <10,000 L/kg and is not readily biodegradable nor has an anticipated 
DT90 <3 days2, entry into the groundwater is considered via bank filtration.

Phase IIa conclusions: 
Based on the PEC/PNEC values are below the respective trigger it can be concluded that Apremilast is 
unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment, groundwater compartment, or micro-organisms in 
the STP. Since metabolites of Apremilast are expected to be less toxic than parent based on reduced 
pharmacological activity, and as PECSURFACEWATER values are expected to be lower than those calculated in 
Phase I for parent Apremilast (as transformation is not expected to result in one single metabolite), it is 
concluded that also the metabolites of Apremilast will not represent a risk to the the aquatic environment, 
groundwater compartment, or the STP. 
The log K ow of Apremilast is < 3 and there are no other alerts for bioaccumulation (i.e. Apremilast is not 
highly adsorptive). Therefore, a bioconcentration study is not indicated and the risk for bioaccumulation 
is considered acceptable. Since the Koc is <10,000 L/kg, Apremilast is not expected to bind to sewage 
sludge in the STP, and the exposure of the terrestrial compartment as a result of application of sludge to 
soil is considered low. Further testing in the terrestrial compartment is not necessary. 
Apremilast is not readily biodegradable. The results of the water/sediment study demonstrate significant 
shifting of a transformation product of Apremilast to the sediment layer, with levels of total radioactivity 
exceeding 10% of applied at and after day 14 (i.e. max 17% of AR on day 28). These results trigger the 
consideration of risk to sediment-dwelling organisms in Phase II Tier B; a chronic sediment toxicity study 
(Chironomid test; OECD 218) is therefore currently being performed. 
The CHMP recommends that the applicant submits the GLP-compliant study of appropriate design to 
determine the partition coefficient of apremilast, and an updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
inclusive of the updated value. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of apremilast was comprehensively characterised in studies comprising PDE4 binding 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 60/189 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
assays, investigations of effects on inflammatory pathways in in vitro cellular models to determine a 
mechanism of action, and studies of anti-inflammatory activity in various animal models of disease. In 
vitro enzyme assays identify apremilast as a potent and selective inhibitor of PDE4, with highly selective 
inhibition over other PDE enzyme subtypes (279- to 40,000-fold). Analysis of the apremilast human 
metabolites indicated that only metabolites M7 and M17 have comparable PDE4 inhibitory activity to the 
parent, account for less than 1% of the apremilast plasma exposure and are therefore not anticipated to 
contribute to the clinical pharmacodynamic effects. In further affinity screens of binding to 68 cell 
surface receptors and for inhibition of 17 enzymes, and a kinase inhibition screen of 255 kinases 
apremilast was not found to cause inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations. 
A large body of in vitro studies were undertaken to determine the cellular mechanism of action of 
apremilast. As the proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism involves increased intracellular cAMP levels 
leading to modulation of CREB/ATF-1 transcription factors and downstream inflammatory mediators, 
assay endpoints focused on effects on gene and protein expression of these pre- and anti-inflammatory 
mediators. Generally in stimulated whole blood cells, PBMCs and primary T-cells, apremilast inhibited 
TNF-α and IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production. IL-6 production was conversely potentiated 
by apremilast in LPS-stimulated HPBMCs, although in LPS-stimulated whole blood, IL-6 increases were 
potentiated only in rodent whole blood and not human or monkey whole blood. The CHMP acknowledged 
that IL-6 potentiation was seen in LPS-stimulated human PBMCS in study 5424-11 and not study 
5042-107. The EC50 for IL-6 induction with ampremilast was 11 µM in this study with a maximum IL-6 
induction of ~2 fold at 100 µM. The applicant stated that the steady state Cmax is 1.45 µM, so the 
non-clinical finding is of limited clinical relevance as the effective concentration is supratherapeutic. 
Furthermore, IL-6 levels were assessed in the phase 3 Clinical Study CC-10004-PSA-002. Compared to 
baseline IL-6, apremilast was associated with a decrease in IL-6 levels which was statisticallt significant. 
The CHMP agreed that the decrease in IL-6 is purported to be secondary to TNF-α reduction.  
The data provided supported the mechanism of action whereby PDE4 inhibition modulates downstream 
inflammatory cascades, thus inhibiting the inflammatory response. In vitro findings were supported by in 
vivo disease models of inflammation, as apremilast inhibited TNF-α production in response to LPS and 
carrageen stimulation in rats. The in vivo models of arthritis and psoriasis provided evidence to support 
the proposed clinical indications. Apremilast appeared to decrease arthritis parameters in rats and mice at 
around 5-25 mg/kg/day, although this did not consistently correlate with histological findings, possibly 
because the disease induction was not severe. In human skin xenograft mouse models of psoriasis, 
apremilast demonstrated reduction in disease and expression of the inflammatory markers TNF-α, 
HLA-DR and ICAM-1.  
Cereblon binding studies were undertaken due to structural similarities between apremilast and 
thalidomide. The lack of competitive binding indicated that apremilast did not bind endogenous cereblon. 
The CHMP considered this is in agreement with the chemical structure of apremilast, which contains a 
dialkoxyphenyl moiety instead of the amino-glutarimide ring which facilitates cereblon-binding in 
thalidomide, lenalidominde and pomalidomide.  
The applicant performed a core battery of safety pharmacology studies, with an integrated respiratory 
and cardiovascular study. In the Irwin’s test, lacrimation, ptosis and apathy were seen ≥1000 mg/kg, and 
one animal died following a 2000 mg/kg dose. The NOEL of 500 mg/kg provides a 12.9-fold or 15.4-fold 
safety margin based on Cmax or AUC24h, respectively, from the proposed clinical dose. The study did not 
indicate a CNS safety concern at clinically relevant doses. Respiratory/cardiovascular safety was 
investigated following intravenous injection of apremilast. The route of administration of apremilast in the 
respiratory and cardiovascular safety study in dogs was justified by the applicant based on the limitations 
of oral administration to anaesthetized dogs, which is acceptable to the CHMP. Respiratory effects in dogs

were limited to moderately increased peak inspiratory and expiratory flow. Apremilast caused a 
dose-dependent increase in heart rate and left ventricular maximum rate of change, and decreased RR 
and QT intervals. QTc was unchanged. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of apremilast on hERG current in 
HEK cells was estimated to be 184.2 μM (84.8 μg/mL) which represents a margin of 127-fold over the 
expected clinical Cmax and does not indicate a potential risk of QTc prolongation. Furthermore a clinical 
QT/QTc study did not indicate any treatment related effects up to 50 mg BID. Gastrointestinal motility, 
which may be decreased by PDE4 inhibitors, was unaffected by apremilast at up 1000 mg/kg. There is no 
safety margin from NOEL of 0.5 mg/kg and the expected clinical exposure; thus a potential for a possible 
for effect of aprelimast on the heart rate cannot be excluded (and will be further investigated as 
desrcribed in the RMP).  
In vitro studies indicated that apremilast may act synergistically with PGE2 to decrease TNF-α mediated 
lung fibroblast recruitment, and expression of pro-angiogenic factors. Some synergistic inhibition of 
psoriasis-related cytokines was demonstrated with cyclosporine or ETAN in stimulated human T cells and 
HPBMCs. In vivo studies demonstrated that apremilast had a synergistic anti-arthritic effect with ETAN 
and methotrexate in mouse arthritis models. In a mouse xenograft model of psoriasis, apremilast showed 
some synergistic efficacy with methotrexate, although less than higher dose of methotrexate alone. 
Following oral doses absorption, apparent clearance was higher in male than female rats, indicating 
significant first pass metabolism. The gender-difference in bioavailability in rats is reflected in the 
significantly greater sensitivity of female rats to apremilast in toxicity studies. During the procedure the 
applicant has clarified with supporting literature references that sex-related differences in exposure are 
common in rats. The increased exposure in rats is consistent with greater oxidative metabolism in male 
rats compared to female rats. The sex-related differences were not seen in non-human primates or in 
humans. Therefore the large differences in exposure between male and female rats are not clinically 
relevant.This was agreed by the CHMP. In female rabbits, clearance was rapid and bioavailability was 
negligible (<0.1%) following oral administration, which suggests that the rabbit is not a suitable species 
for toxicity studies. With the exception of mice, oral doses had relatively short apremilast half lives, and 
radioactivity half lives were substantially higher, suggesting significant exposure to metabolites of 
apremilast. 
The tissue distribution of [14C]-apremilast-derived radioactivity was determined in albino and pigmented 
mice by quantitative whole body autoradiography. Rapid distribution was evident with radioactivity in all 
tissues measured by 2 hours. Highest levels were present in kidney and liver, in line with excretory 
routes. Radioactivity was relatively highly distributed to pancreas and gastrointestinal mucosa. 
Distribution to the CNS, indicating blood barrier permeability, and reproductive organs was evident at 24 
hours but not detectable by 72 hours post dose. Radioactivity was not detected in any tissues at 168 h 
after dosing or later. In pigmented mice, levels of radioactivity were elevated in the uveal tracts of the 
eyes compared to albino mice at 1 and 3 days post-dose. In pregnant mice, apremilast was measurable 
in fetal plasma at concentrations lower or equal to maternal plasma levels, indicating apremilast crosses 
the placenta and results in significant fetal exposure. In lactating mice, apremilast was detected in milk at 
greater levels than plasma (~1.5 fold), indicating lacteal excretion and potential for lacteal transfer to 
offspring. In vitro plasma protein binding studies found apremilast was 88.6%, 90.6%, 80.9% 84.% and 
68% bound in mouse rat rabbit monkey and human plasma, respectively. The data indicate that all 
species used for toxicity studies have similar levels of plasma protein binding, but all are substantially 
lower than in human. 
Studies in liver microsomes indicated that apremilast is subject to multiple metabolic pathways, namely 
non-enzymatic (hydrolysis of phthalimide ring leading to M1 and M2), non-CYP-dependent hydrolysis 
(N-deacetylation leading to M7) and CYP-dependent oxidation (O-dealkylation to M3 and other minor 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

metabolites). No sex differences in metabolism were observed in any species, except rat. Human 
hepatocyte studies were compromised by significant metabolism in negative controls with increased 
M1/M2 and M18. Metabolism was much higher in rabbits than other species (up to 30% compared to 
0.8-26%). All the metabolites formed by human liver microsomes and hepatocytes were formed by one 
or more animal species. There were no significant differences between in vitro metabolic profiles in adult 
and juvenile hepatocytes in humans, or microsomes in humans or mice, indicating the species are 
suitable for juvenile toxicity studies.  
In vivo metabolites were quantified in mouse, rat and monkey plasma and excreta. In mice apremilast 
was extensively metabolised by hydrolysis, oxidative metabolism and subsequent glucuronidation. 
Following oral dosing parent drug was the highest analyte in males but not in females. Hydrolysis 
products M1 and M2 were the major circulating plasma metabolites and M15 to a lesser degree. M3, M9, 
M19 and M22 were also present. In rats, significant differences were seen in the plasma metabolite profile 
in males and females. In males little or no apremilast was seen, and M12 accounted for 43% of dose, 
whereas apremilast was the principle component in females, followed by M1 and M2. The increased 
circulating parent drug in females corresponds to the greatly increased sensitivity seen in toxicity studies 
in females. Excreta profiles were qualitatively similar between sexes with about 25% of dose recovered as 
M3, and M9 and M12 also present at 4-7%. In rabbits, no parent drug was measurable in plasma was 
measurable and metabolites were not determined. In monkeys, metabolism was extensive by 24 post 
dose, with M1, M2 and M12 and two polar metabolites MkP2 and MkP3 present at the greatest levels. 
Metabolism was extensive with less than 1% of parent drug identified in excreta. The predominant faecal 
metabolite was M3, while the primary urinary metabolite was M12. Overall apremilast underwent 
extensive metabolism in mouse rat and monkey. Each of the major metabolites was present in at least 
one animal used for toxicity studies. M12 was present in human plasma at higher proportion than all 
species with the exception of male rats. However M3 and M12 exposures were measured at greater than 
the expected human exposure as part of the 6 month mouse toxicity study and 12 month monkey toxicity 
study. The metabolites are therefore considered toxicologically qualified. The applicant will test M12 in in 
vitro induction studies on CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 (as as described in the RMP). 
In mice and monkeys apremilast was primarily excreted through feces, with approximately 71% and 73% 
recovered by 48 hours in male and female mice respectively, and around 68% in monkeys. Urinary 
excretion was responsible for <5%. There was no indication of sex-related differences in elimination rates 
in mice or monkey. The data indicated that excretion was extensive, with total recovery at 48 hours over 
90% in mice, and near-complete recovery in monkeys at 168 hours. In bile duct cannulated mice, the 
majority of dose was eliminated in bile, indicating that biliary excretion is the major route of elimination 
in mice. In rats, elimination was incomplete, most likely owing to the 24 hour duration of the study. 
However the amount recovered was similar to that in mice at 24 hours, which indicated excretion would 
likely be extensive at later time points. The fecal route also appears to be the major route of excretion in 
rats. Initial recovery of radiation was greater in males, indicating slower excretion rates in females, in 
agreement with overall exposure levels seen in female rats. Comparison across animal species was 
consistent, with fecal excretion the primary route in each species, and urinary excretion a minor route. 
However in humans, urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination with 57% of dose recovered in 
urine and less than 40% in feces. During the procedure, the applicant suggested that the differences in 
excretion profiles across species do not have any implications for the species used for toxicity studies, as 
the metabolic pathways and circulating metabolites were comparable and provide safety coverage in the 
species used for toxicity studies and in humans. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Analysis of apremilast metabolism in human liver microsomes indicated the metabolites M3 and M5 were 
the major CYP450-dependent metabolites. Subsequent inhibition studies indicate that CYP3A4 is the 
principle enzyme responsible for metabolism to both M3 and M5, although CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 may also 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 63/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
contribute to the conversion. The CHMP concluded t that some inhibition of CYP2C8 was seen with 
apremilast, with a roughly 38 fold safety margin, so this inhibition in not clinically relevant.  
In an in vitro CYP450 induction assay, apremilast caused a small decrease in activity of CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C9 although this was not apparent in the inhibition assay. CYP3A4 induction was apparent at with a 
3.7-fold induction 100 µM. This concentration is roughly 70 times the expected clinical Cmax and therefore 
is not considered clinically relevant. 
In P-glycoprotein assays in LLC-PK1 cell lines, apremilast was demonstrated to be actively transported by 
P-glycoprotein, as ketoconozole inhibited transport by 92%. Apremilast was itself a weak inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein, with an IC50 ≥ 50 µM. The finding is described in the product information. Interaction 
studies with a range of transporters did not find significant inhibition of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, MRP1, 
MRP2, MRP4, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3, and neither appeared to be a substrate for 
BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT2. 
Acute oral minimum lethal dose was >2000 mg/kg in mice and 2000 and 300 mg/kg in male and female 
rats, respectively. The data did not indicate a potential for acute systemic toxicity in humans at the 
expected clinical dose. 
The mouse was chosen as the rodent species for repeat dose studies based on metabolism and 
pharmacokinetic data. Specifically metabolites M3 and M7 were not seen in rat liver microsomes, but seen 
in human microsomes, and large gender differences in exposure were seen in rats. Overall the choice of 
rodent species is acceptable to the CHMP. In mice, daily oral administration for up to 6 months was 
generally associated with increased body weight gain and food consumption. The most significant 
pathology findings in mice were vascular and perivascular inflammation seen in the heart, thoracic 
organs, kidney and lung, thymus, mesentery, pancreas and liver, which was accompanied by 
inflammatory lesions and degenerative vascular changes. These findings correlate with neutrophilia, 
lymphocytopenia, and changes in clinical chemistry characterised by decreased plasma albumin and 
increased globulin. The chronic mouse study NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day corresponds to a lower AUC24 value 
than is expected clinically; therefore no safety margin exists based on plasma exposure.  
In cynomolgus monkeys treated for up to 12 months, adverse findings included mortality, decreased body 
weight, emesis and/or reflux, and some changes in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. 
Isolated occurrences of vascular inflammation were seen in the one month study. Myocardial 
inflammation was also seen in monkeys given 1000 mg/kg/day apremilast for 2 weeks (12.8-fold clinical 
safety margin from NOAEL). These findings were not seen in the 12 month study, however some small 
foci of chronic inflammation were seen in the heart at all doses. The applicant considered that the small 
foci of chronic inflammation in the heart were not treatment-related, as the findings occurred in control 
and treatment groups. In support of this, a report by Chamanza ¬et al was referenced. The report found 
that in 570 control cynomolgous macaques, the average incidence of inflammatory cell foci was 25.8%, 
and in some cases 100% of control animals were affected. Focal myocarditis and myocardial 
degeneration/fibrosis was seen 6.3% and 5.6% of animals respectively. Due to the low number of animals 
used per group in the monkey repeat-dose studies, extrapolation is not possible, but generally the data is 
consistent with the findings seen in the monkey studies with apremilast. In the 14 day dose range-finding 
study, the applicant stated that treatment-related moderate multifocal myocardial inflammation and 
haemorrhage and myocardial degeneration were observed in two of three animals at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
These findings were also seen in one animal at 200 mg/kg/day. However the absence of findings at the 
500 mg/kg/day dose, suggest that the findings were not dose-dependent. Moreover the findings were not 
seen in studies with longer duration, which supports the conclusion that the findings could be attributable 
to hypersensitivity myocarditis. Overall the conclusions on the findings in the heart of monkeys 
administered apremilast are acceptable to the CHMP.

This pro-inflammatory effect in the vasculature is considered by the applicant to be specific to rodents, as 
vasculitis was not seen in the cynomolgus monkey studies or in clinical studies to date. In an in vitro 
study, LPS-induced IL-6 production was potentiated by PDE inhibitors including apremilast and 
roflimulast in rodent blood but not human or monkey blood (Report 5265-117). However in another study 
performed by the applicant (Report 5424-11) apremilast also potentiated the LPS-induced elevation of 
IL-6 in human PBMCs, indicating pro-inflammatory potential in humans. Therefore the data do not 
robustly support the proposed mechanism. The applicant provided supportive evidence of 
species-specificity based on literature reports. The literature does indicate a class-related 
pro-inflammatory effect of PDE4 inhibitors in rodents, and previous studies are consistent with the 
histopathological findings the vasculature with accompanying pro-inflammatory haematology and clinical 
chemistry markers (Larson et al 1996; Dietsch et al 2006; Zhang et al 2008). Moreover the sensitivity of 
rodents may be explained by a greater contribution of PDE4 to overall PDE cardiac activity in rodents 
(50%) versus human (10%) hearts. Although the mechanism of toxicity in rodents is not elucidated, and 
therefore the human relevance is uncertain, the findings are consistent with other PDE4 inhibitors, and in 
the absence of clinical evidence of vasculitis or changes in clinical lab tests or markers of inflammation, 
the nonclinical findings do not appear to present a clinical safety concern. These findings have been 
described in the product information. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Toxicokinetic data confirmed that the nonclinical species were exposed at or above expected therapeutic 
levels based on AUC values for patients receiving 30 mg BID. The NOAEL AUC levels from the pivotal 6 
month repeat dose mouse studies provided no safety margin from the expected clinical dose. The NOAEL 
AUC levels in primates provide a 5.8- and 3.7-fold safety margin from the expected clinical dose. 
Reproductive toxicity NOAELs provided little or no safety margin from the expected clinical dose. The 
metabolites M3 and M12 were identified in the chronic mouse/monkey and monkey studies, respectively 
at NOAEL levels substantially greater than those seen in humans. The CHMP considered that the 
metabolites are qualified for general toxicity by the repeat dose studies.  
The applicant has performed the standard battery of genotoxicity studies, in line with ICHS2A/B; the 
studies did not indicate any genotoxic potential. 2 year carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice 
and rats, in line with ICH S1. In mice, neoplastic findings of malignant lymphoma in males and skin 
sarcoma in males and females were not considered to be attributable to apremilast. Incidence of 
sarcomas were attributed to microchip tagging, which is well characterised in the literature. Incidence of 
malignant lymphoma in males appeared to decrease with increasing dose. This is most likely due to the 
atypically high number of findings in the control group (20% compared to historical incidence of 7.6%). 
However, as there was no dose-dependent increase in tumours, and all groups were within the expected 
incidence for this type of finding (4.5-8.6%), the atypical control findings are not considered to have 
masked any apremilast-related effects. In rats, there was no evidence of carcinogencity. Taken together, 
the CHMP concluded that the rodent bioassays indicate that apremilast is not carcinogenic. 
The selection of mouse and monkey for reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified by the 
unfavourable metabolite profile and sex-related exposure differences in rats, and the lack of measurable 
exposure to apremilast in rabbits, respectively. The justification is acceptable to the CHMP. In the initial 
fertility study, fertility indices and matings were decreased, and time to mating was increased. No NOAEL 
was established and post-implantation losses were also increased at all apremilast doses, and the 
average number of viable embryos was reduced at 1000 mg/kg. In the subsequent female fertility and 
EED study, apremilast was associated with reduced number of estrous cycles, longer estrous cycle length, 
and longer time to mate. However fertility indices were not affected. Apremilast decreased fertility in mice 
when both males and females were dosed. Changes in male reproductive organ weight were not 
correlated with histopathological findings. In apremilast-treated females the number of estrous cycles 
was reduced and cycle length prolonged, without decreased fertility indices when mated with untreated 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 65/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
males. The NOAEL for functional effects on fertility provide a 2.9-fold and 4.0-fold safety margin from the 
clinical dose in males and female. 
Consistent finding in all the studies with dosing during gestation was toxicity to the offspring, including 
lethality, both in utero and post-natally. In the embryo-fetal development studies, the maternal and 
developmental NOEL in mice and monkeys were 10 and 20 mg/kg/day (1.3- and 1.4-fold clinical AUC), 
respectively. In a pre- and postnatal study, the NOEL for maternal toxicity and F1 generation was 10 
mg/kg/day (1.3-fold clinical AUC). There was evidence of dystocia at 300 mg/kg/day and to a lesser 
extent at 80 mg/kg/day.  
Although NOAELs were identified for the reproductive toxicity studies, there is no safety margin for the 
effects on survival of the conceptuses.  
Apremilast was shown to cross the placenta in monkeys and was excreted in the milk of mice.  
The absence of defining the dose-response in the mouse to establish whether malformations are induced 
at a dose intermediate between the NOAEL and a dose inducing lethality, and the absence of information 
on the abortuses in the monkey study are the main deficiencies. Of note, the pattern of intra-uterine and 
post-natal deaths seen with apremilast in rodents is frequently seen with cardiovascular teratogens. 
Given that apremilast has anti-VEGF activity, and has been demonstrated to inhibit sprout formation from 
human umbilical cord vessels, its potential to cause cardiovascular abnormalities cannot be excluded. 
Although none have been reported, it is not clear from the mouse study report how thoroughly the heart 
and major blood vessels were examined for malformations. The applicant clarified that the mice fetuses 
were examined for cardiovascular malformations in the Combined Fertility and Developmental Toxicity 
Study using a modified Wilson’s sectioning technique (test facility training manual, SOP and historical 
control data provided). There were no heart or great vessel findings. The applicant confirmed that aborted 
fetuses were not evaluated for malformations, as they were not adequately developed to facilitate 
examination of developmental defects. The applicant also clarified that the possibility that malformations 
can occur in the embryos that are lost prior to scheduled cesarean section cannot be ruled out. In the 
mouse, these early prenatal losses typically manifest as implants undergoing resorption at the time of 
cesarean section; therefore, no fetal morphological examination can be performed. In the monkey, 
pregnancy losses usually occur as abortions, and the aborted fetal tissues are usually degenerated and 
cannot be evaluated morphologically. The CHMP acknowldeged the inability to identify potential 
malformations in embryos lost prior to caesarean section, due to degeneration of the fetal tissues in 
monkeys, and resorptions of implants in mice. The product information was amended to mention that the 
effects apremilast on pregnancy included embryofetal loss in mice and monkeys, and reduced fetal 
weights and delayed ossification in mice at doses higher than the currently recommended highest human 
dose. During the procedure the CHMP requested the SWP’s opinion as to whether a contra-indication for 
pregnancy is justifiable for apremilast on the basis of animal data only. The SWP considered that following 
administration of apremilast, pre-natal deaths occurred in all combined or standalone embryo-foetal 
development toxicity studies in both species tested (mice and monkeys) and that minimal clinical data are 
available. As of 15 May 2013, 21 pregnancies (7 female subjects and 14 partners of male subjects) were 
reported during the apremilast clinical trials. There were no congenital anomalies reported for any subject 
or partner of male subjects who became pregnant while being exposed to apremilast therapy. However it 
could be argued that miscarriage/post-implantation loss could occur before the patient knew they 
pregnant and as such, these data would not be captured. The following considerations have been made 
with respect to the fact that only animal data would be the basis for a contra-indication: Small safety 
margins (1.3 and 1.4 for mice and monkeys respectively) in reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies; Apremilast has anti-angiogenic properties and thus potential induction of malformations cannot 
be excluded. Early embryolethality may have masked these malformation effects; Psoriatic arthritis and 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

chronic plaque psoriasis are not life-threatening conditions and that other treatments are available or that 
treatment could be modified/deferred/avoided.These considerations are in line with sections 8.2.1.2 and 
8.2.1.3 of the Guideline on Risk assessment of Medicinal Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: 
From Data to Labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). The SWP therefore considered that apremilast 
should be contra-indicated during pregnancy. At the CHMP’s request, a contraindication in pregnancy has 
therefore been included by the applicant in the product information.  
Increased weight gain was seen in mice both prior to mating in the combined fertility and embryo-fetal 
development study and in repeat-dose toxicity studies. While this effect is considered to be 
treatment-related, the applicant argued that it is not adverse based on lack of histopathological findings 
or clinical correlation. While gravid uterine weight was not recorded in the combined fertility and EFD 
study, the applicant has discussed available data from a separate EFD study in which mean maternal body 
weights (corrected for gravid uterine weight) were similar between control and apremilast-treated 
groups. The historical control rate for scoliosis in monkeys has been provided by the test facility. 
According to the Covance memo, 3 incidences of scoliosis have been detected out of 634 control monkey 
fetuses (>0.005 %). There were only 3 live fetuses for evaluation in the 1000 mg/kg/day group, one of 
which was affected with scoliosis which equates to an incidence of 33.3 % in this group. However, given 
that scoliosis is widely accepted to have familial origins and that adequate safety margins exist between 
the exposure at which this finding was seen and that anticipated through clinical use of apremilast, this 
finding is not considered to be of clinical relevance. The applicant has presented the incidence of rotated 
hindlimbs in the combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in mice as both litter incidence 
and fetal incidence to account for the increased embryo-fetal mortality observed at higher doses. It was 
agreed by the CHMP that the fetal incidence did not increase in a dose-dependent manner and the values 
were generally within the incidences observed historically at the testing facility or just slightly outside of 
the upper end (2.1%) of the historical control range. The applicant’s conclusion that this finding was not 
toxicologically meaningful is accepted by the CHMP. 
In a juvenile mouse study, apremilast was associated with increased mortality within the first week of 
treatment. Over 90 days treatment was generally well tolerated, indicating that animals were initially 
more susceptible to treatment. The study did not highlight any toxicities specific to juvenile animals. Local 
tolerance and phototoxicity studies did not indicate potential safety concerns. Metabolites of apremilast 
are toxicologically qualified based on their presence in mouse and monkey in the general toxicity studies. 
The potential for immunotoxicity was discussed by the applicant, and was assessed in the context of the 
repeat dose studies above. Overall the effects on the immune system was generally sufficiently 
characterised in the existing nonclinical package, notwithstanding concerns in monkeys. 
Based on the 8-fold lower PDE4 inhibition of CC-10007, adverse effects of the R-enantiomer due to 
exaggerated pharmacology are not expected. A comparative toxicity study in female rats demonstrated 
that CC-10007 did not cause the general toxic effects associated with the apremilast. In order to qualify 
the impurity RC6 in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, apremilast was spiked with 5% w/w 
RC6, which gave a maximum concentration of 250 µg/plate (5000 µg apremilast/plate). However, as 
precipitate was seen at the highest concentration, the RC6 impurity may not have been tested at 250 
µg/plate, which is the detection limit for most relevant mutagens in the Ames test (Kenyon et al., Reg Tox 
& Pharm, 2007, 75-86; Questions and answers on the 'Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007 Rev. 3)). During the procedure, the applicant clarified that the impurity 
RC6 was qualified based on its presence in the mouse carcinogenicity study and the in vitro Ames test. 
Given that RC6 is also the animal metabolite M7, the impurity exposure in the carcinogenicity is expected 
to be 2-3 fold greater than the level in humans at 30 mg BID. Therefore, in line with ICH M7, the impurity 
is considered qualified as it was present at a greater concentration than will be achieved from exposure 
through the drug substance. The applicant’s justification is acceptable to the CHMP.

A Phase I and Phase IIa environmental risk assessment was performed. Apremilast is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. The applicant will submit the GLP-compliant study of appropriate design 
to determine the partition coefficient of apremilast, and an updated Environmental Risk Assessment 
(ERA) inclusive of the updated value. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In vitro pharmacological characterisation determined apremilast to be a potent and selective inhibitor of 
PDE4 highly selective inhibition over other PDE enzyme subtypes and various enzymes and kinases. As 
the proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism involves increased intracellular cAMP levels leading to 
modulation of CREB/ATF-1 transcription factors and downstream inflammatory mediators, in vitro activity 
endpoints focused on effects on gene and protein expression of these pre- and anti-inflammatory 
mediators. Generally in stimulated whole blood cells, PBMCs and primary T-cells, apremilast inhibited 
TNF-α and IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production. In vitro findings are supported by efficacy in 
in vivo disease models of inflammation including rodent models of arthritis and psoriasis.  
Safety pharmacology studies did not indicate a CNS or respiratory safety concern, or effects on 
gastrointestinal motility, at clinically relevant doses. In dogs apremilast was associated with 
dose-dependent increase in heart rate and left ventricular maximum rate of change, and decreased RR 
and QT intervals, although QTc was unchanged. In vitro hERG inhibition assays revealed no clinically 
relevant risk of QTc prolongation. 
The pharmacokinetics of apremilast has generally been well characterised by the applicant. 
Based on the small safety margins (1.3 and 1.4 for mice and monkeys respectively) in reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies and that psoriatic arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis are not 
life-threatening conditions and that other treatments are available or that treatment could be 
modified/deferred/avoided, the CHMP considered that apremilast should be contra-indicated during 
pregnancy in line with sections 8.2.1.2 and 8.2.1.3 of the Guideline on Risk assessment of Medicinal 
Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: From Data to Labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005).

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The Apremilast clinical development program for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis comprises one Phase 
2 study (Study PSA 001) and four Phase 3 studies: PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA 004, and PSA-005. 
The three replicate pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSA-002, PSA 003, and PSA-004) are conducted in subjects 
with inadequate response or intolerance to small-molecule DMARDs and/or biologic DMARDs. The 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

supportive study PSA-005 evaluated apremilast as a monotherapy. All 4 studies are in the long-term 
extension phase. The 52-week data from the three pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSA-002, PSA 003, and 
PSA-004) and 24-week data from the fourth Phase 3 study (PSA-005) are included in this submission. 
Studies PSA 002, PSA 003, and PSA 004 are considered to be pivotal studies.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of apremilast was investigated in 16 clinical pharmacology studies, and eight phase 2 or 3 studies 
including subjects with PsA, PSOR or RA.  
Based on the intensive and sparse data from these studies, the disposition characteristics of apremilast, 
in terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME), have been derived. Intrinsic 
factors of hepatic or renal impairment, age, sex, ethnicity, and disease type and their potential impact on 
PK have also been investigated as well as extrinsic factors including concomitant use with CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers, methotrexate (MTX) and the oral contraceptive (OC). Finally, an investigation of the 
potential of apremilast to prolong QT interval completes the package. 
The concentration of CC-10004 (Apremilast) and its metabolites, CC-16793 [M14], CC-16557 [M16] and 
CC-16166 [M12]) in acidified lithium heparin human plasma was determined using LC-MS/MS. Sample 
preparation involved liquid/liquid extraction prior to analysis. 
Absorption  
Apremilast is a low solubility compound with a measured solubility of 10.8 – 14.5 µg/ml over the pH range 
1 to 8. Data from a mass balance study PK-002 (and an absolute bioavailability/regional absorption study 
CP-012)  have indicated that apremilast is rapidly and well absorbed following oral administration, with a 
tmax of 1- 3 hours and absolute bioavailability of around 73%. CP-012 has also shown that while oral 
absorption of apremilast occurs at all regions of GI tract, as might be expected, the major site of 
absorption (93 %) is the proximal small bowel. Food does not affect oral absorption (CP-022) and  kinetics 
are linear with the area under the curve (AUC) increasing in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg BID 
(or 80 mg QD), which therefore encompasses the proposed therapeutic dose.  
Bioavailability 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 72/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Data from Study CC-10004-PK-002 and Study CC-10004-PK-012 showed that in healthy subjects, 
apremilast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration along the entire gastrointestinal tract, with an 
average absolute bioavailability of approximately 73%. Tmax was between 1 and 3 hours.  
The mean total urinary and faecal radioactive recovery of CC-10004 (and its metabolites) was 97.1%, 
with mean contributions of 57.9% and 39.2% from urine and faeces, respectively. 
Study CC-10004-CP-022 demonstrated that oral absorption of apremilast occurs at all regions of the GI 
tract. By delivering apremilast as a particulate formulation to the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel 
and colon, the relative bioavailability for each of these regions of the GIT were 90%, 77% and 51% 
respectively. 
Relative Bioequivalence  
One study (CC-1004-BA-001) was designed to compare bioavailability of apremilast capsules made with 
milled API relative to that of apremilast capsules made with micronized API, under both fasting and fed 
conditions.   
In the fasting state AUC and Cmax for the micronized capsules were significantly higher than for the milled 
capsules. AUC was 17% less and Cmax was 22% less in the milled versus the micronized capsules. Also in 
the fed state Cmax was significantly higher for the micronized capsules, although AUC was comparable.  
Another study (CC-1004-BA-002) was designed to compare the bioavailability of apremilast delivered as 
an oral 40 mg tablet to that of two 20 mg apremilast capsules under both fed and fasting conditions. The 
results of this study are listed in the table 16 below.

Influence of food 
Study CC-10004-CP-022 examined the effect of food on the absorption of a single 30mg dose of 
apremilast in healthy subjects and demonstrates that concentration versus time profiles were similar in 
both fed and fasted conditions. The 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios for AUC and Cmax of fed versus 
fasted were within the range 80-125%. Table 17 below gives a summary of the PK parameters measured, 
and Table 18 provides some statistical analysis.

Distribution 
After IV administration, the mean volume of distribution was 87L (Study CC-10004-CP-012). Apremilast 
is moderately bound to plasma proteins at 68%. 
Elimination 
•  Excretion 
Apremilast is mainly eliminated as metabolites formed via both cytochrome P450 mediated oxidative 
metabolism and non CYP mediated hydrolysis. Less than 3% of the dose excreted in urine and less than 
7% of the dose excreted in faeces is unchanged apremilast. Following IV administration apremilast has a 
mean total clearance of approximately 10L/hour and a terminal half life of approximately 6 to 9 hours. 
•  Metabolism 
ADME Study CC-10004-PK-002 characterised the pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral 20 mg 
suspension dose of apremilast in healthy male subjects, and found that in line with in vitro findings, 
apremilast was extensively metabolised into multiple metabolites. Up to 23 metabolites were recovered in 
urine and faeces. The major metabolic route was O- demethylation, with 50% of the dose metabolised 
this way. Other metabolic paths include O- deethylation, N -deacetylation, hydroxylation, hydrolysis of 
the imide ring and various combinations of these pathways.  CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 all participate 
in apremilast metabolism, however it appears that CYP3A4 is the main CYP enzyme involved. Other 
isozymes such as CYP2A6 and CYP1A2 seem to play a much less prominent role, but may compensate in 
the event of CYP3A4 inhibition.  
• 
Inter-conversion 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 75/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Study CC- 10004-PK-005 which primarily evaluated the influence of multiple doses of ketoconazole on the 
pharmacokinetics of apremilast in healthy adult males also examined for the presence of CC-10007, the 
R- enantiomer. The study concluded that the R- enantiomer was not present in plasma or urine in any 
quantifiable amount.  
• 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The PK parameters for apremilast and its main metabolites are outlined in table 19 below.  
All of the main metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.  
The two pharmacologically active metabolites M7 and M17 accounted for less than 1% of the apremilast 
plasma exposure, and are not anticipated to contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect. 
19 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Apremilast demonstrated consistent and comparable dose-proportional exposure in healthy subjects 
across all the clinical pharmacology studies to 50mg BD or 80mg OD.  
In one clinical pharmacology study in subjects with RA or PsA (CC-10004-PK-010) and five phase 2 and 
3 studies in subjects with PsA, psoriasis, or RA, apremilast exposure was consistent and comparable, 
although apremilast exposure does appear to be approximately 40% higher in subjects with PsA, 
psoriasis, or RA versus healthy subjects. 
• 
Time dependency 
The pharmacokinetics of ascending multiple oral dosing of apremilast was evaluated in 2 healthy 
volunteer studies (Studies CC-1004-PK-001 and CC-1004-PK-007). Apremilast displayed rapid 
absorption with maximum plasma concentrations occurring at a median t max of 1 to 3 hours. Following 
Cmax the plasma concentrations declined in an apparent biphasic manner. The mean apparent half life was 
estimated to be 5 to 7 hours. Steady state was achieved within 24 hours of the start of multiple dosing. 
Doses up to 40 mg daily did not appear to cause accumulation. There was slight accumulation at 40 mg 
BD and above. Systemic exposure increased in a dose proportional manner across all doses.  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 76/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
An objective of 5 Phase 2 and 3 trials was to determine sources of variability in PK parameters.  Each of 
these studies suggested that apremilast exhibits moderate inter subject variability. Between subject 
variability ranges from approximately 33-43% for CL/F (apparent clearance), and 20-43% for Vc/F 
(apparent central volume of distribution) were observed.  Intrasubject variability for AUC for 6 of the 
clinical pharmacology studies ranged from 7.7% to 18.6%. For the 2 studies presented where only 
apremilast was administered, the intrasubject variability for AUC was less than 10%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
Study CC- 1004-CP- 019 was carried out to examine the pharmacokinetics of apremilast and its major 
metabolite M12 in subjects with severe renal impairment and normal renal function. This was a two 
centre, open label, single dose study. Severe renal impairment was taken as those subjects with an eGFR 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and normal renal function was defined as eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2. There were 
8 subjects enrolled with severe renal impairment and these were compared to 8 healthy subjects with 
normal renal function. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, gender and weight within 
reasonable limits. All subjects received a single dose of 30 mg apremilast. Blood samples were taken at 
incremental timepoints from pre dose until 72 hours post dose. These samples were analysed for both 
apremilast and M12 concentrations. Non compartmental methods were used to calculate the following 
pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, tmax, and t 1/2, CL/F, Vz/F. 
In severe renal impairment systemic clearance and the volume of distribution for apremilast were 
decreased by 46.9% and 32.7% respectively, and t 1/2 was increased by 2.5 hours. The decrease in 
clearance resulted in an increase in AUC of 88.5% and an increase in Cmax of 41.6%. Tmax appeared to be 
unaffected by renal function, and was 3 hours in both the severe renal impairment group and the normal 
renal function group.   
In terms of the pharmacokinetics of the M12 metabolite, the differences were more pronounced. T1/2 was 
prolonged by 62% (10.5 hours). The decrease in clearance resulted in an increase in AUC of 191.5% and 
an increase in Cmax of 42.9%.  
Simulations have suggested that 30 mg QD produces apremilast exposure comparable to a 30mg BD dose 
in those with normal renal function. A single dose of 30 mg apremilast also appeared to be well tolerated 
in subjects with severe renal impairment, and their demographically matched subjects with normal renal 
function. Pooled population PK analysis from 86 subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment has 
been provided, and this did not show a correlation between creatinine clearance and apremilast 
clearance. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of apremilast and its major metabolite M12 was 
evaluated in human subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and severe hepatic impairment, and 
compared to age-gender matched volunteers with normal hepatic function and of similar weight (Study 
CC-10004-CP-011). A total of 32 subjects (male and female) were enrolled; of these 8 had severe hepatic 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 77/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
impairment, 8 had mild hepatic impairment and 16 had normal hepatic function. The degree of hepatic 
impairment was measured according to the Child Pugh classification. Each subject in the moderate 
hepatic impairment group received a single 30 mg oral dose of apremilast, while a reduced single dose of 
20 mg was administered to the severe hepatic impairment group for safety reasons. Safety was also 
monitored including laboratory tests, ECG, and examination.  
For the moderately impaired group, both apremilast and M12 plasma profiles were overall similar in 
shape, with slightly higher concentrations seen in the healthy subjects. For the severely impaired group, 
both apremilast and M12 concentrations were again overall similar in shape.

Study CC-10004-CP-024 was designed to evaluate the effects of age and gender on apremilast exposure 
after a single dose of 30 mg apremilast in healthy adults. Eligible healthy elderly and young subjects were 
matched by sex and BMI and received a single apremilast 30 mg tablet under fasting conditions.   
Some sex differences in apremilast pharmacokinetics were noted. Both AUCt and AUC0-∞ were greater in 
female subjects compared to male subjects by 28% and 31% respectively. Tmax was 2.75 hours in the 
female subjects versus 2.5 hours in the male subjects. Apremilast t1/2 was also increased by 28% in 
females compared to males and had a reduced clearance (11.2L/h v 8.57L/h). The sex differences 
between males and females in terms of apremilast pharmacokinetics were even more pronounced in the 
elderly population. Apremilast exposure was approximately 30-50% higher in elderly females than in 
young and elderly males and young females. 
Because the overall exposure (AUC0-∞ ) in elderly and female subjects are within the AUC 0-tau range 
evaluated at 30mg BID in the phase 2 study (CC-10004-PSOR-005), the effect of gender is considered not 
to be clinically meaningful. 
The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of apremilast was also examined in psoriasis patients in one 
of the pivotal phase 3 clinical studies: CC-1004-PSOR-008-PK. This also revealed an overall reduction in 
apparent clearance of apremilast in females in the order of 31%. Gender was identified as a statistically 
significant covariate on apremilast clearance.  
• 
Race 
The effect of race on pharmacokinetics was examined specifically in one pharmacokinetic study: Study 
CC-1004-CP-018. A total of 36 healthy subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects from each of the following 
ethnicities: Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian. The subjects were matched within acceptable limits for age 
and body mass index. A single dose of either apremilast 20 mg or apremilast 40 mg was compared to 
placebo. Sequential blood samples were taken up to 48 hours after the dose. AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf and Cmax 
appear to be dose proportional for both 20 mg and 40 mg single doses for each of the 3 ethnicities 
studied. The geometric mean AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf and Cmax were in the range of 5.5% to 19.49% less in the 
Japanese and Chinese groups compared to the White groups.  
• 
Weight 
Body weight was a statistically significant covariate on apremilast apparent clearance in one population 
PK analysis, PK-10004-RA-002-PK. Simulations under steady- state with 20mg BD, 30mg BD and 40mg 
OD regimens of apremilast for the 10th and 90th percentiles for weight were performed in men and women. 
The subjects with a lower percentile of body weight presented maximum concentrations slightly higher 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 78/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
than subjects with the upper 90th percentile weight, but that the difference was within the expected 
margin for inter subject variation.  
• 
Elderly 
Study CC-10004-CP- 024 was designed to evaluate the effects of age and gender on apremilast exposure 
after a single dose of 30 mg apremilast in healthy adults. With regard to age, tmax was comparable 
between the elderly (mean age 70 +/- 4.15 years), and the younger (mean age 34.3+/-7.17 years) 
groups at 2.5 hours. AUC exposure was 13% higher in the elderly healthy group compared to the young 
healthy group (not statistically significant). However the difference was more pronounced when further 
analysed for gender. Young and elderly females combined had an AUC 30% higher than in young and 
elderly combined males. AUC was approximately 30-50% higher in elderly females than young and 
elderly males and young females combined.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
In vitro studies have been conducted to examine the role of CYP isozymes in the oxidative metabolism of 
apremilast. The potential inhibitory and inductive effects of apremilast on CYP activities in vitro were also 
evaluated. In vitro study results demonstrated that apremilast does not inhibit or induce any major 
CYP450 isozymes (CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and 
CYP2C8) at clinically-relevant drug levels. These results suggested that when co administered, apremilast 
is not likely to interact with drugs metabolized by the major CYP450 isozymes and transporters. 
Apremilast was also evaluated in vitro as a potential inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Additionally apremilast was evaluated as a potential inhibitor of MRP1, 
MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 and MRP8 in vitro. Apremilast does not inhibit transporters including P-gp, BCRP, 
OAT1, OAT3, MRP1, MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 at a concentration range of up to at least 
five times more than the C max of the target clinical dose of 30 mg BID (CC-10004-DMPK-027, 
CC-10004-DMPK-036, and CC-10004-DMPK-040). 
• 
In vivo 
Specific interaction studies were carried out for ketoconazole, rifampin, methotrexate and norgestimate 
(NGM) and ethinyl estradiol (EE). 
Ketoconazole Interaction Study- CC-10004-PK-005 
The potential for a drug-drug interaction between apremilast and ketoconazole was examined in Study 
CC-10004-PK-005. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of multiple doses of 
ketoconazole (a known potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) on the single-dose PK of apremilast. 
Co-administration with ketoconazole increased apremilast mean AUC by approximately 36% (weak 
inhibitory effect of ketoconazole) and Cmax by 5%. The 90% CI of AUC was 126.2% to 147.49%, indicating 
that this was a statistically significant increase in apremilast exposure.  
Rifampin Interaction Study- CC-10004-CP-025 
As a strong inducer of CYP3A4, rifampin was specifically studied for drug- drug interactions with 
apremilast in healthy subjects. Apremilast alone was compared to apremilast administered after multiple 
oral doses of rifampin, and apremilast delivered with a single IV dose of rifampin. Co-administration 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 79/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
following pre-treatment with multiple once daily oral doses of rifampin increased apremilast apparent 
clearance from 9.6 L/h to 34.5 L/h, which resulted in a decrease in apremilast mean AUC (approximately 
72% lower) and Cmax (approximately 43% lower) relative to that of apremilast given alone.  
Methotrexate Interaction Study- CC-10004-PK-010 
Study CC-10004-PK-010 was designed to determine any effect of apremilast on the exposure of 
methotrexate or its metabolite 7-OH MTX, as well as any potential effect of methotrexate on apremilast 
exposure on patients on stable doses of weekly methotrexate ( 10- 20 mg weekly) for the treatment of 
psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Norgestimate (NGM) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) Interaction Study- CC-10004-CP-020 
Study CC-10004-CP-020 was designed to evaluate the potential for drug-drug interactions between 
combined oral contraceptives and apremilast. EE and NGM pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable 
with and without apremilast treatment.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Safety was examined as a secondary outcome in many of the clinical pharmacology studies. Apremilast 
appeared to be well tolerated throughout.    
Special populations 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Apremilast, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of PDE4, works selectively and intracellularly to modulate a 
network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Apremilast works intracellularly to 
modulate a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. PDE4 is a cAMP-specific PDE 
and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition elevates intracellular cAMP, which in turn 
down-regulates the inflammatory response by modulating the expression of TNF-α, IL-23, IL-17 and 
other inflammatory cytokines. Elevation of cAMP also modulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as 
IL-10, produced by endotoxin-stimulated mononuclear cells. A reduction in inducible nitric oxide synthase 
was also observed. These pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in psoriasis and

PsA. In psoriasis studies, apremilast also caused a reduction in the numbers of dendritic cells and T cells 
infiltrating skin lesions.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
This has been investigated in studies PSOR-001, PSOR-004, PSA-002 and PSOR-009. In the PSOR 
studies, APR treatment was associated with a decrease in dendritic cells and T cells infiltrating the skin 
lesions, within the epidermis or the dermis. Also in both studies, a significant decrease in inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression was observed in the lesion skin biopsies taken 2, 4, or 12 weeks 
after treatment initiation. In PSOR-001, a decrease in the ability of whole blood to produce TNF-α in 
response to endotoxin was observed 2 hours after dosing. PSOR-004 showed that  APR decreased lesional 
skin epidermal thickness and expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including iNOS, IL-12/IL-23p40, 
IL-23p19, IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-8 while in PSOR-009-PD, changes in inflammatory biomarkers were 
observed in the peripheral blood at Week 16. Treatment with APR at the proposed therapeutic dose of 30 
mg BID also resulted in significantly lower percentage changes from baseline, compared to placebo, of 
alpha 2 macroglobulin, IL-17, Regulated on Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) 
as well as Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) plasma levels. In PSA-002-PD, the only PsA 
study in which plasma protein biomarkers were examined, APR was associated with modulation of IL-1α, 
IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β, TNF-α, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), ferritin, and a small increase in 
von Willebrand factor (vWF) plasma protein levels (NB.  vWF was within the normal range [<120 μg/mL]). 
Among these, the changes in TNF-α and vWF were significantly associated with achieving an ACR20 
clinical response.  
Study PSA-002 
In this Study PSA-002 a subset underwent PD evaluation. In a total of 150 subjects (placebo: N=51; APR 
20 mg BID: N=51; and APR 30 mg BID: N=48) blood samples were taken for biomarker analysis. Of the 
51 subjects randomised to treatment with placebo, 18 in the placebo/20 mg group and 14 in the 
placebo/30 mg group early escaped to active treatment at Week 16. At Week 4, the first post-baseline 
assessment, a significant (p<0.05) effect of APR treatment (20 mg BID or 30 mg BID) compared to 
placebo was observed in the change and/or percentage change from baseline 4 for IL-8, MCP-1, MIP1-β, 
MMP-3, and TNF-α. This effect was observed again at Week 16, the primary efficacy endpoint of the 
clinical trial, for IL-8, MIP-1β, and MMP-3. At Week 16 (LOCF), significant (p < 0.050) differences in the 
change from baseline, or in the percentage change from baseline compared with placebo were observed 
in the APR 20 BID and/or APR 30 BID groups in IL-8, IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, ferritin, and vWF plasma 
protein levels (CC-10004-PSA-002-PD). At Week 24 (LOCF), subjects in the APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID 
group had significant (p < 0.050) changes compared to subjects treated with placebo in IL- 8, MCP-1, 
MIP1-β, MMP-3, TNF-α, IL-6, ferritin, IL-2, and vWF plasma protein expression. 
Analyses of the within-treatment biomarker changes from baseline over 40 weeks of treatment found that 
16 of the 47 analytes (alpha-1 antitrypsin, complement C3, Eotaxin-1, Factor VII, von Willebrand factor, 
ferritin, IL-10, IL-17, IL-1α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-23, IL-6, IL-8, MIP- 1β, MMP-3, and TNF-α) 
appeared to show meaningful changes from baseline based upon multiple criteria. Nine of the 16 analytes 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 81/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) percentage change from baseline at Week 40 in the APR 30 
mg BID group (Eotaxin-1, Factor VII, Ferritin, IL-10, IL-17, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-23, IL-6, 
MMP-3), including 5 that showed percentage changes that were also significant at Week 40 in the APR 20 
mg BID group (Factor VII, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-23, IL-6, MMP-3).  
PSOR-001 
The PD objective of this study was to evaluate the PD effect of orally administered APR (2 X 10 mg once 
daily [20 mg QD] awakening, when taken for 29 days, for reducing epidermal thickness in subjects with 
severe plaque PSOR.  Eight (53.3%; 95% CI [26.6, 78.7]) of the 15 subjects with evaluable skin biopsies 
demonstrated 
a ≥20% reduction in epidermal thickness at Day 29. Thus, the pre-specified protocol-defined definition of 
a PD response was met. 
Mean reduction from baseline in epidermal and dermal T cells at Day 29 was 18.6% and 23.4%, 
respectively. Similar changes from baseline in epidermal and dermal CD83 and CD11c cells were 
observed, although the mean change from baseline was not statistically significant for most parameters. 
Several subjects with biomarkers present in psoriatic lesional biopsies at baseline showed an absence of 
these markers at Day 29 (as would be expected in normal, non-psoriatic skin): ICAM-1 and filaggrin, 3 
subjects; HLA-DR, 2 subjects; quantitative K16, 1 subject. Mean mRNA gene expression of most 
psoriasis-related inflammatory markers, including iNOS (P < 0.0001) and K16+, was decreased at Day 29 
relative to baseline. 
APR had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on ex vivo whole blood LPS-stimulated TNF-α 
production 2 hours after the first dose. In the 11 subjects with ex-vivo whole blood LPSstimulated TNF-α 
data, all subjects (11/11) had an inhibition of the LPS-stimulated TNF-α production from predose to 2 
hours postdose on Visit 2, whereas 7 out of 11 subjects had the inhibition of the LPS-stimulated TNF-α 
production from pre-dose to 2 hours post-dose on Visit 6. On Visit 2 (Day 1), the mean % (SD) inhibition 
of the LPS-stimulated TNF-α was -35.2 % (21.5%), ranging from -71.9% to -5.5% (negative sign 
indicates inhibition). On Visit 6 (Day 29), the mean % (SD) inhibition of the LPS-stimulated TNF-α 
production was -5.1% (35.9%), ranging from -43.0% to 79.7%. Inhibition of TNF-α production was also 
noted after 2 hours post-dose at Day 29 but was not statistically significant, most likely because TNF-α 
levels were already suppressed from the prior 29 days of therapy. Mean changes in CD19+, 
CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and RO±/RA±T-cell subtypes were small with no consistent pattern over time. 
Interestingly, 12 of 15 subjects experienced a decrease from baseline in the NK (CD16/56+) lymphocyte 
population at the end of the study drug treatment period compared with pre-treatment (baseline) values. 
Recent experimental evidence suggests that NK and NK T cells special populations are involved in the 
pathogenesis of psoriasis as these cells produce INF-γ, which is the only cytokine identified thus far to play 
a role in psoriasis keratinocyte proliferation (Bos, 2005). Fourteen of the 19 subjects (73.7%) enrolled in 
the study demonstrated an improvement in their psoriasis symptoms, and 3 (17.6%) of the 17 subjects 
with data at Day 29 had a > 50% reduction from baseline in their total PASI score (PASI-50). Nine 
(52.9%) of the 17 subjects with an assessment at Day 29 had at least a 1-category improvement in the 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

sPGA Average Overall Lesions Scale score relative to baseline. Ten (58.8%) of the 17 subjects with a 
psoriasis BSA assessment at Day 29 showed an improvement relative to baseline. 
Study PSOR-004 
In PSOR-004, an open label study in subjects with recalcitrant plaque psoriasis treated with apremilast 20 
mg BID, lesional skin biopsies from 20 subjects were evaluated at baseline, Week 4, and Week 12.  
The intent of the biopsy analysis was to study the extent to which disease-related pathology is affected or 
impacted by APR and to determine inflammatory pathways which are impacted by its administration in 
skin lesions of plaque PSOR. This analysis extends a previous analysis in which drug-related effects in 
PSOR skin lesions were analysed after 4 weeks of treatment (Study PSOR-001). The biopsies were 
analysed in two ways:  
•  Histologically- in H&E stained sections of skin biopsies after staining frozen sections of skin 
biopsies with antibodies to keratin 16, CD3, CD11c, ICAM-1, Langerin, CD56, Foxp3, and 
HLA-DR, including, therefore assessment of epidermal growth/differentiation, skin infiltration by 
T-cells and DC subsets, presence of regulatory T-cells, and presence of inflammation-regulating 
molecules in skin lesions.  
•  mRNA abundance for a variety of inflammatory molecules-measured by real-time RT-PCR and 
expression was normalized to the house-keeping gene HARP (human acidic ribosomal protein). 
Histological Analysis 
Of the 20 cases analysed, 19 showed active PSOR lesions in baseline biopsies. 
One Subject had minimally reactive epidermis in the baseline lesional biopsy so did not meet histologic 
criteria for active psoriasis at baseline biopsy. At Week 4, 10 subjects showed improvement in PSOR 
based on a reduction in epidermal hyperplasia and/or a reduction in keratin 16 (K16), which is produced 
only in reactive (hyperplastic) epidermis. Using all measured values of thickness, there was a median 
23% reduction in epidermal thickness at Week 4 (P = 0.08 in a 2-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test). 
Nine subjects showed histological disease improvement in Week 12 biopsies, with 5 subjects showing 
absence of K16 staining, a marker for hyper-proliferative keratinocytes consistent with plaque PSOR. At 
this time-point, the median reduction in epidermal thickness was 34% (P = 0.083). Hence, the 
quantitative reduction in epidermal thickness was not significant for the group as a whole. Since 
spontaneous improvement in psoriasis is rare, the fact that the 5 subjects became K16- (K16 negative) is 
clinically meaningful. It was noted that improvement in the disease phenotype was more obvious at Day 
29 in some cases and then there appeared to be an increase in PSOR disease activity at Day 85. A 
summary of changes in histological staining in the dermis and epidermis, as well as epidermal thickness, 
is provided in Table 20.

Table 20: Summary of Percent Change from Baseline (Week 0) in Histological Parameters 
from Skin Biopsy by Visit - Safety Population (PSOR-004) 
CD11c marks myeloid dendritic cells (DC) in human skin. Normally, there is a resident population of 
CD11c+ cells in the dermis, but psoriasis shows both an increase in dermal CD11c+ DCs and 
inappropriate migration of CD11c+ cells into the epidermis of skin lesions. These myeloid DC are also 
called TIP-DCs (TNF- and iNOS-producing DCs). As to the infiltrating CD11c+ myeloid DCs in these 
biopsies, overall there was a major reduction in both the dermis and epidermis at both week 4 and week 
12. Dermal CD11c+ DCs were reduced in Week 4 and Week 12 biopsies by -45.8% (P=0.001) and -54.6% 
(P=0.018) respectively. Epidermal CD11c+ DC were reduced to an even greater degree, by -73.1% at 
week 4 (P=0.002) and -88.6% at week 12 (P=0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions 
in CD3+ T cells and CD56+ cells (NK cells or NK-T-cells) in the epidermis and dermis. Langerin, a marker 
of Langerhans cells (LC), was slightly elevated in the epidermis but not the dermis, consistent with 
normalisation of this cell population with effective therapy. In general, reductions in cellular infiltrates in 
epidermis and dermis were numerically greater among responders (those with a change in PASI of 75% 
or more at Week 12) than among non-responders. 
The expression of inflammation-associated molecules ICAM-1 and HLA-DR was reduced in parallel with 
disease improvement reflected by epidermal thickness or K16 staining. These are qualitative markers of 
inflammation, so the change was not quantified and subjected to statistical analysis. Note that HLA-DR is 
also expressed by skin-resident DCs, so there was appropriate residual staining for this molecule at Week 
12. 
To address whether inflammation is suppressed through increase T regulatory (Treg) cell presence in 
psoriatic plaques, Treg cells were stained. The presence of Treg (Foxp3+) cells in the dermis of skin 
lesions was reduced over time in parallel with reductions in T-cells.  
Gene Expression Analysis of Response 
Inflammatory markers assessed by mRNA levels included the chemokine CXCL9, human defensin beta 4 
(DEFB4), IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-17a, IL-22, IL-8, K16, Mx-1, IL-12/23 p40, IL-23p19, iNOS, and TNF. These are 
inflammatory molecules produced by activated DC populations, Th1, Th17, Th22 T-cells, and response 
genes to interferon (Mx-1, CXCL9) or IL-17 (defensin). Keratin 16 is also measured by mRNA levels to 
assess the epidermal response by an alternate means. All mRNA levels were normalized to the 
house-keeping gene HARP (human acidic ribosomal protein). 
At Week 12, there was a median reduction in K16 mRNA by 78% (P = 0.015), which is consistent with the 
overall improvement of PSOR at this same time-point. The reduction in K16 mRNA was of a higher 
magnitude than the reduction in epidermal thickness, as this keratin is produced only in reactive 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 84/189 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(hyperplastic) epidermis. Normal epidermis has a thickness value, so the maximal case for a thickness 
reduction is to normal values. 
From the histologic analysis, CD11c+ myeloid leukocytes showed more consistent reductions than T-cells 
in lesions. From the genomic standpoint, iNOS, IL-12/IL-23p40, and IL-23p19 genes are products of 
inflammatory (CD11c+) DCs. Normalized iNOS mRNA expression was reduced by 61% at Week 4 (P = 
0.029) and by 100% at Week 12 (P = 0.008). While TNF mRNA level was reduced by 42.7%, this change 
was not statistically significant; however, it was of sufficient magnitude to elicit clinical response. Another 
TNF-induced gene in CD11c+ DCs is the IL-12/23 p40 gene. IL-12/23 p40 showed significant reductions 
in Week 4 and Week 12 biopsies. The expectation of this reduction is that levels of IL-12 and/or IL-23 
would be reduced, with subsequent reductions in Th1, Th17, and Th22 T-cell activation, followed by 
reductions in downstream genes of IL-17 or interferon signaling. IL-17A mRNA levels were reduced by 
49% at Week 12 (P = 0.031) and normalized IL-22 mRNA levels were reduced by 100% at Week 12 (P = 
0.031). DEFB4 is a defensin-induced in keratinocytes by IL-17. Expression of DEFB4 was reduced by 55% 
in Week 4 biopsies (P = 0.029) and by 82% in Week 12 biopsies (P = 0.014). IL-8 is also induced in 
keratinocytes by IL-17. Expression of this inflammatory chemokine was reduced by 76% in Week 4 
biopsies (P = 0.004) and by 66% in Week 12 biopsies (P = 0.018). The larger magnitude reduction in IL-8 
(as compared to DEFB4), probably reflects the co-regulation of IL-8 by TNF and the fact that TNF signaling 
is probably reduced by APR. Hence, a strong case can be made that the IL-23/Th17 & Th22 response 
pathways were reduced in treated skin lesions. From the response pattern, it can also be inferred that TNF 
signaling (production) is reduced by apremilast. In contrast, there is less evidence that Th1 T-cell 
activation is strongly affected, as consistent reduction in IFN-γ and CXCL9 mRNA were not measured. 
However, a consistent reduction in normalised MX-1 mRNA was observed in biopsies: median reduction of 
51% at Week 4 (P = 0.008) and a reduction of 52% at Week 12 (P < 0.001).  
At the cellular level, pathologic epidermal hyperplasia and production of K16 by epidermal keratinocytes 
were reduced in Day 29 (Week 4) and Day 85 (Week 12) biopsies. The reduction in K16 mRNA was of 
higher magnitude than reductions in epidermal thickness, as expected from known biology. One 
demonstrated action of APR is suppression of TNF mRNA levels in vitro (Schafer, 2010). While a 
statistically significant reduction in TNF mRNA levels in the skin was not observed in this clinical study, 
there was a reduction of 42.7%, which was enough to elicit a clinical response. Overall, the results of this 
study do show a large reduction in inflammatory DCs in psoriasis. CD11c+ DCs in PSOR have also been 
called TIP-DCs (TNF- and iNOS-producing DCs). APR reduced overall numbers of CD11c+ DCs and, in 
particular, pathologic infiltration of psoriatic epidermis by this cell set. Reductions in iNOS mRNA and p40 
mRNA, along with reductions in Th17 and Th22 T-cell pathways were observed in these psoriasis lesions. 
From the reductions in MX-1 levels, it is also likely that interferon levels are reduced as a direct or indirect 
effect of APR. To identify changes in cellular infiltration or gene expression that correlate with changes in 
PASI score, a correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank-order correlation method. A 
significant correlation was observed between the decrease in CD56+ NK cells in the epidermis and the 
decrease in the PASI score at week 4 (p = 0.009). A strong trend was observed between the decrease in 
CD11c+ myeloid DC in the epidermis the decrease in PASI score at Week 4 (p = 0.052). For the 
inflammatory gene expression, a significant correlation was observed between the decrease in PASI score 
and the decrease in DEFB4 at Week 4 (p=0.005) and Week 12 (p = 0.009), IL-17A at Week 12 (p = 
0.030), K16 at Week 4 (p < 0.001), MX-1 at Week 4 (p = 0.008), and IL-12/IL-23p40 at Week 4 (p = 
0.033). These results suggest that K16, MX-1, and IL-12/IL-23p40 mRNA levels may reflect the early 
effects in the mechanism of action of APR.

PSOR-009 
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque PSOR, PD analysis was carried-out in a subset of 100 out of approximately 405 randomised 
subjects subjects  to explore the relationship of APR to changes in plasma inflammatory biomarkers (47 
inflammatory proteins). At selected time points, blood samples for PD analysis were obtained from the 
subset i.e. at week 0 (baseline), and weeks 4, 16, 32, 36, 40, and 44. In contrast to Studies PSOR-001 
and PSOR-004, wherein inflammatory markers were measured in the target tissue, in Study PSOR-009 
they were measured in plasma.  
At the time of the primary end-point, PASI-75 at Week 16 (last observation carried forward, LOCF), 
compared to placebo, APR significantly reduced plasma levels of the following proteins: alpha 2 
macroglobulin (p=0.0389), an acute phase reactant and coagulation factor overexpressed in psoriasis 
patients; interleukin-17 (p=0.0454), a key driver of the Th17 immune responses which is central to PSOR 
pathogenesis; chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES) (p=0.0102), a keratinocyte-derived 
chemokine which is increased in psoriatic lesional skin, and; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 
(TIMP-1) (p=0.0073), a Th1 and Th17 cell product that is abundantly expressed in psoriatic skin and 
plasma. There were no significant associations between changes in these plasma proteins and clinical 
response as measured by PASI-75 at week 16 (NRI or LOCF). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Study CC-1004-PK-008 was a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial to determine the 
potential for apremilast and its major metabolites to affect QT interval. The study was carried out in 
healthy male subjects. Moxifloxacin was used as an open label positive control to assure the sensitivity of 
the assay. As the clinically effective dose, 30 mg BD was chosen. A supra-therapeutic dose of 50mg BD 
was also examined. There were no safety concerns arising from the study. All change from baseline QT 
values for both the 30 mg BD and the 50mg BD doses were below 1ms, and the upper limit of the 90% CI 
for both doses was well below 10 ms at all time points. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Study PSOR-005, a Phase 2b dose-ranging study, supports the selection of the apremilast 30mg BD 
therapeutic dose. In this study, 352 subjects were randomized to 4 treatment groups (placebo, 
apremilast 10mg BD, 20mg BD, and 30mg BD). The response rates at Week 16 were 11.2% (p = 0.1846), 
28.7% (p < 0.0001), and 40.9% (p < 0.0001) for the 10mg BD, 20mg BD, and 30mg BD treatment 
groups, respectively, compared to the placebo (5.7%). A clear dose response was demonstrated across 
the doses studied. No clinically significant safety signals were observed in either the 20mg BD or 30mg BD 
groups.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
One early study (CC-1004-BA-001) was designed to compare the bioavailabiltyof apremilast capsules 
made with milled API that of apremilast capsules made with micronized API, under both fasting and fed 
conditions.  In the fasting state AUC and Cmax for the micronized capsules were significantly higher than 
for the milled capsules. AUC was 17% less and Cmax was 22% less in the milled versus the micronized 
capsules. Also in the fed state Cmax was significantly higher for the micronized capsules, although AUC 
was comparable. The applicant stated that these results justify the selection of milled API in the 
subsequent manufacturing of apremilast tablets. Since milled API was used throughout the clinical 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

development programme, and in all the pivotal studies, failure to strictly meet BE limits is not clinically 
significant. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Another early study (CC-1004-BA-002) was designed to compare the bioavailability of apremilast 
delivered as an oral 40 mg tablet to that of 20 mg apremilast capsules under both fed and fasting 
conditions. The applicant has concluded that either capsule or tablet formulation could be used in the 
clinical studies. However in the fasting state the tablet resulted in a 13% increase over capsule 
formulation for AUC and C max. The 90% CI for the least square mean ratio of tablets to capsules for both 
Cmax (96.3;133.88) and AUC (100.16;126.09) lie outside the conventional bioequivalence limits of 
80-125%. In the fed state, AUC lay within the conventional limits, however the 90% CI for Cmax was not 
(106.96;149.85). Hence the bioequivalence of the tablet to the capsule was not been established. 
However this study was performed early in the clinical development programme. All of the subsequent 
major pivotal trials were performed with the milled tablet formulation, hence failure to strictly meet BE 
limits is not clinically relevant.  
CC-10004-RA-002-PK compared apremilast exposure data from healthy subjects with that of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis, and showed a 32% reduction in clearance in the RA group. The population PK 
analyses of cumulative data in healthy subjects and subjects with PsA (studies CC-10004-PSA-001-PK 
and CC-10004-PSA-002-PK combined) identified that subjects with PsA had approximately 36% slower 
apremilast clearance than healthy subjects. 
In Study CC-10004-PSOR-008-PK a pooled population PK analysis identified disease status and gender as 
statistically significant covariates on the apparent clearance of apremilast. Overall apparent clearance 
was 20% slower in patients with psoriasis than in healthy subjects. The apparent clearance of apremilast 
in subjects with PsA, RA and psoriasis was calculated to be 7.34L/hour, 7.6L/hour and 7.4L/hour 
respectively. This suggested that each of the inflammatory diseases confers a similar reduction in the 
apparent clearance of apremilast. By comparison the clearance in healthy volunteers is approximately 
10L/hour.  
With regards to severe renal impairment (eGFR<30ml/min/1.73m2), the applicant recommended a 
reduced dose of 30 mg once daily. This was agreed by the CHMP. Simulations have suggested that 30 mg 
OD produces apremilast exposure comparable to a 30 mg BD dose in those with normal renal function. A 
single dose of 30 mg apremilast also appeared to be well tolerated in subjects with severe renal 
impairment, and their demographically matched subjects with normal renal function. 
Pooled population PK analysis from 86 subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment has been 
provided, and this did not show a correlation between creatinine clearance and apremilast clearance. 
The applicant has also provided the results of a subsequent study of apremilast PK in mild and moderate 
renal impairment that were not available at the time of the original submission, study CC-10004-CP-029. 
The results of this study, although not statistically significant, supported the findings of the population PK 
analysis in relation to mild and moderate renal impairment, and also supported the proposal not to dose 
adjust for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment.  
The applicant concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that the pharmacokinetics of apremilast and 
its major metabolite M12 were affected by moderate or severe hepatic impairment at the doses evaluated 
in this study, and consequently stated that there need not be dose adjustment for subjects with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment. The applicant extrapolated that no remarkable effect would be expected in 
those with mild hepatic impairment given that no appreciable effect was noted in moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment. This was agreed by the CHMP. The applicant will provide results of vitro studies to 
evaluate M12 as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2D6, and as an inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 
(as described in the RMP).

Population PK analysis from a pivotal phase 3 psoriasis study CC-1004-PSOR-008-PK indicated that 
overall, apparent clearance was approximately 31% lower in female subjects than in males, and that age 
was not a statistically significant covariate on apparent total plasma clearance. However it is notable that 
the number of patients included over the age of 75 years was small.  The applicant discussed how the 
increase in drug exposure in female and elderly subjects could result from their smaller mean body 
weight. Because the overall exposure (AUC0-∞ ) in elderly and female subjects are within the AUC 0-tau 
range evaluated at 30mg BID in the phase 2 study (CC-10004-PSOR-005), the effect of gender is 
considered not to be clinically meaningful. The applicant reported that the exposure differences attributed 
to gender were within the expected between subject variability for apparent clearance and hence 
proposed that no dose adjustment based on sex is necessary. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
With regard to the effect of race on pharmacokinetics, the applicant has performed analysis 
based on combined apremilast pharmacokinetic parameters derived from non compartmental 
analysis in various phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. This has indicated that apremilast 
exposure is similar among Caucasian, Caucasian Hispanics, non-Caucasian Hispanics and 
African American ethnicities. 
Study CC-10004-PSOR-008-PK which included both healthy subjects and placebo patients, concluded 
that body weight was not a significant covariate on apremilast clearance, and supported the 
recommendation that dose adjustment is not required with respect to body weight.  
The potential for a drug-drug interaction between apremilast and ketoconazole was examined in Study 
CC-10004-PK-005. The applicant stated that this is not of clinical relevance based on the 50% to 200% 
criterion defined a priori in the protocol. Widened confidence intervals were selected on the basis of safety 
data available for apremilast dosing up to 100mg. The 90% CI of Cmax was 92.16% to 119.30%, and was 
within the acceptance range of 80% to 125%. Therefore while ketoconazole did reduce the apparent 
clearance of apremilast, and increase its AUC by 36%, this does not appear to be clinically meaningful. 
This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Data also showed that that apremilast exposure is decreased when administered concomitantly with 
strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin) and that this may result in reduced exposure. The product 
information has been updated accordingly and this was agreed by the CHMP. 
The data also shown that MTX did not appear to affect apremilast exposure. Apremilast concentrations 
reached steady state by Day 7, and its parameters were comparable with or without methotrexate, 
suggesting that methotrexate can be given with apremilast without affecting apremilast exposure. The 
product information has been updated accordingly and this was agreed by the CHMP. 
The data from study CC-10004-CP-020 also shown that that combined oral contraceptives do not affect 
apremilast exposure. The product information has been updated accordingly and this was agreed by the 
CHMP. 
Study CC-1004-PK-008 was a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial to determine the 
potential for apremilast and its major metabolites to affect QT interval. The study was carried out in 
healthy male subjects. All change from baseline QT values for both the 30 mg BD and the 50mg BD doses 
were below 1ms, and the upper limit of the 90% CI for both doses was well below 10ms at all time points. 
The CHMP concluded that apremilast is not anticipated to cause any significant prolongation of the QT 
interval up to the 50mg BD dose.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of apremilast have been well characterised.  
The effects of gender, age and body weight have been explored in population PK analysis, and the results 
showed that dose adjustment is not required in each case. While the number of elderly subjects is limited 
(particularly over 75 years) the analysis showed that any age related reduction in clearance is not 
clinically significant. Gender and body weight were also examined by means of population PK analysis, 
and did not emerge as significant covariates.  
The recommendation to reduce the dose to 30 mg once daily in severe renal impairment is appropriate.  
Sufficient data has also been provided to justify the recommendation not to dose adjust in patients with 
mild and moderate renal impairment.  
Drug- drug interactions have been addressed well overall, in particular in relation to the main CYP enzyme 
involved, CYP3A4. The possibility of interactions in relation to CYP 1A2 and CYP 2A6 has been examined 
and does appear not to be a concern. There are also studies underway to look at M12 as an inhibitor and 
inducer of the CYP enzymes (as described in the RMP).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The active treatments, 20 mg and 30 mg BID APR, were chosen to be taken forward to Phase 3 on the 
basis of nonclinical in vitro data (reports 5042-107 and 5424-11) and clinical pharmacology data from 
studies PSA-001-PK and PSOR-005-PK (these study findings indicated that both APR 20 mg and 30 mg 
BID maintained the level of APR above the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of 
the production of the key cytokines in the pathogenesis of PsA (Schafer, 2010) i.e. TNF-α, IL-2, IL-8, 
IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and MCP-1) and two Phase 2 trials (Study PSA-001 in PsA and Study 
PSOR-005 in PSOR). 
Within the clinical development programme, two Phase 2 trials (PSA-001 and PSOR-005) assessed the 
efficacy and safety in PsA, compared to placebo, of APR 20 mg BID and 40 mg QD (once daily) over a 12 
week period.  On 20 mg active treatment, separation from placebo was seen as early as Week 4, with a 
statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects on active treatment achieving an ACR 20 and ACR 
50 response at Week 12. ACR 20 was 43.5% versus 11.8%; p <0.001 and ACR 50 was 17.4% versus 
2.9%; p = 0.012 on active and placebo, respectively. In contrast, the APR 40 mg QD treatment group 
achieved statistical significance, compared with placebo for only ACR 20 (35.8% versus 11.8%; p = 
0.002) and not for ACR 50 (13.4% versus 2.9%; p=0.056 for active and placebo, respectively. Safety and 
tolerability was comparable between the two dosing regimens. Based on these findings, i.e. greater 
efficacy with comparable safety and tolerability, BID dosing was selected over QD dosing for the Phase 3 
programme. 
In the Phase 2 study (PSOR-005) in subjects with moderate to severe PSOR a clear dose response was 
seen comparing 10, 20 and 30 mg BID. The primary endpoint of the study, the proportion of subjects 
achieving a 75% or greater improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75 response) at 
Week 16, was not seen at the 10 mg BID level but was statistically significant with both 20 and 30 mg BID 
(28.7% and 40.9%, respectively, compared to 5.7% for placebo; p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). 
Separation of the PASI-75 response between the active and placebo arms was seen by Week 4 with 30 mg 
BID but was slower, being seen at Week 8, with the lower 20 mg dose.  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 89/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Apremilast was well tolerated at both doses, with no clinically important emergent safety signals and a 
comparable safety profile. For both dose levels the Cmin exceeded the IC50 for inhibition of the 
production of multiple PDE4-dependent cytokines (Schafer, 2010). Given the genetic and immunologic 
association between psoriasis and PsA, the applicant considered it was reasonable to extrapolate from 
these data in psoriasis and assume that a similar safety and efficacy profile would also apply to the PsA 
population also. 
Based on these findings, it was decided that 20 mg and 30 mg APR BID would be compared in Phase 3 for 
PSA and 30mg BID was used for PSOR. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS 
The Apremilast clinical development program for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis comprises one Phase 
2 study (Study PSA 001) and four Phase 3 studies (PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA 004 and PSA-005). 
Studies PSA-002, PSA-003, and PSA-004 evaluated apremilast as a monotherapy or in combination with 
small-molecule DMARDs, and Study PSA-005 evaluated apremilast as a monotherapy. Studies PSA-002, 
PSA-003, and PSA-004 are ongoing and are considered pivotal to the proposed indication. The 24-week 
placebo-controlled phase and the active-treatment phase up to Week 52 have been completed in each of 
these studies. The studies are currently continuing in the active-treatment/long-term safety phase. Data 
up to 52 weeks for these studies are included in this application. Data up to 24 weeks are described for 
Study PSA-005.  
Study PSA-002 (PALACE 1): A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of two doses of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with active 
psoriatic arthritis. 
Study PSA-003 (PALACE 2): A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of two doses of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with active 
psoriatic arthritis. 
Study PSA-004 (PALACE 3): A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of two doses of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with active 
psoriatic arthritis and a qualifying psoriasis lesion. 
Study PSA-005: A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
efficacy and safety study of two doses of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis 
who have not been previously treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  
Methods 
Each of these studies has a common, replicate, design which includes three treatment phases (Figure 1):  
• 
• 
• 
Treatment Phase 1: 24-weeks, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Treatment Phase 2: randomised, double-blind active treatment phase of at least 
28 weeks’ duration,  
Treatment Phase 3: open-label, long-term safety phase of up to 4 years’ duration.  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 90/189 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The overall study duration of each study is 5 years. 
An early escape provision was included in the study design. At Week 16 (the time of the primary 
endpoint), all subjects whose TJC and SJC had both not improved by 20% were required to enter early 
escape (EE) to blinded active treatment. Subjects in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups 
who met EE criteria continued to receive the same dose of apremilast to which they were originally 
assigned, under blinded conditions. At Week 24, all subjects in the placebo group who had not entered EE 
at Week 16 were rerandomized 1:1 in a blinded fashion to receive 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID apremilast 
(PBO/20 crossover [XO] and PBO/30 XO treatment groups, respectively). Subjects who were already 
receiving apremilast at Week 24 (i.e., those who were initially randomized to apremilast or who had 
entered EE at Week 16) continued to receive their randomized treatments in a blinded fashion.  
Figure 1 - Study Design Schematic (Studies PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA-004, PSA-005) 
Study Participants  
To be eligible for inclusion, subjects had to have a documented diagnosis of PsA (by any criteria) of ≥ 6 
months’ duration in the pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA-004) or ≥3 months’ duration in 
Study PSA-005. In addition, in all four studies, subjects were required to meet CASPAR criteria at 
screening and have active disease, as evidenced by ≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender joints. All subjects in Study 
PSA-004 also had to have at least one qualifying psoriasis skin lesion ≥2 cm in addition to active PsA, and 
subjects were stratified by baseline body surface area (BSA). 
The eligibility criteria for the pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSA-002, PSA-003, and PSA-004) required subjects 
to have been treated with small-molecule and/or biologic DMARD(s). The enrolment of subjects with 
therapeutic failure to TNF blockers was limited to 10%. All subjects who had been on a small-molecule 
DMARD (or combination DMARDs) for at least 4 months and were taking a stable dose for at least 4 weeks 
prior to screening, were permitted to continue concurrent small-molecule DMARD(s) treatment (MTX, 
LEF, and/or SSZ). Across the three PsA Phase 3 studies, approximately 65% (966/1493) of subjects were 
taking permitted DMARDs (MTX, LEF, and/or SSZ) at baseline, with a median treatment duration of 21.8 
months and 15.1 months on a stable dose. 96.2% (929/966) of subjects had at least 4 months of 
continuous exposure at baseline.  75% of patients on DMARD were treated with methotrexate (MTX) and 
on average were treated with MTX for 21 months and on a stable dose for 14 of those months. The 
average dose of MTX was 15mg. Concomitant treatment with biologics, including TNF blockers, was 
prohibited. Treatment assignments were stratified based on small-molecule DMARD use at baseline 
(yes/no) and, in Study PSA-004, by baseline BSA involvement with psoriasis (<3% and ≥ 3%). Subjects 
who had previously failed treatment with >3 agents for PsA (small molecules and/or biologics) or >1 
biologic TNF blocker were excluded.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive apremilast 20 mg BID (APR 20 BID treatment group), apremilast 30 
mg BID (APR 30 BID treatment group), or identically placebo during the 24-week placebo-controlled 
phase. As for the PSOR programme, apremilast was dose-titrated in 10-mg/day increments over the first 
week of treatment. In accordance with the titration schedule, subjects in the APR 20 BID treatment group 
reached their target dose on Day 4 of treatment, and subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group reached 
their target dose on Day 6 of treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of all 4 studies was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 2 doses of apremilast (20 mg 
or 30 mg orally twice daily [BID]), compared with placebo, on the signs and symptoms of PsA after 16 
weeks’ administration. 
Secondary Objectives 
1.  To evaluate the following in subjects with active PsA who are treated with 2 doses of apremilast or 
placebo for up to 24 weeks: 
- Safety and tolerability 
- Efficacy 
- Physical function 
- Fatigue 
- Clinical disease activity 
2. To evaluate the following in subjects with active PsA who are treated with 2 doses of apremilast for up 
to 52 weeks: 
- Safety and tolerability 
- Efficacy 
- Physical function 
- Fatigue 
- Clinical disease activity 
-  To  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  2  doses  of  apremilast  during  up  to  5  years’ 
administration to subjects with active PsA 
Study 004  also included evaluation of psoriatic skin  lesions as a secondary objective.  Study 002 also 
included a   pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) sub study.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in each apremilast treatment group (APR 20 BID and 
APR 30 BID), compared with placebo, who achieved a modified ACR 20 response after 16 weeks of 
therapy. The modified ACR 20 required at least 20% improvement, relative to baseline, in both TJC and 
SJC, as well as at least 20% improvement, relative to baseline, in at least 3 of the 5 following 
components: 
•  HAQ-DI Patient’s (subject’s) global assessment of disease activity 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 92/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
• 
 (PGA) Subject’s assessment of pain  
Evaluator’s (physician’s) global assessment of disease activity (EGA) 
•  C-reactive protein (CRP)  
Other ACR response assessments, ACR 50 and ACR 70, were similarly defined, except that 50% and 70% 
improvements from baseline, respectively, were required. Change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 16 
was the key secondary endpoint. 
An extensive range of secondary endpoints have been evaluated in this application at week 24 and 52 
including PsARC, CDAI, EULAR, SF-36 (Physical function Domain score and Physical Component 
Summary) FACIT-F, MASES, Dactylitis Severity Score, BASDAI and PASI-75. 
Sample size 
Sample size estimations were based on the results of the phase 2 Study PSA-001. A 2-group chi-square 
test with a 0.025 two-sided significance level has more than 95% power to detect a true 20% absolute 
difference (40% versus 20%) between one dose of apremilast and placebo, for the proportion of subjects 
achieving an ACR 20 when the sample size in each group is 165. 
Randomisation 
At the Baseline Visit (Week 0), subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in 
parallel in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID apremilast or placebo, using the IVRS. 
The IVRS stratified the randomization according to DMARD treatment (yes/no) and ensured that at least 
25 subjects in the DMARD treated group were taking either LEF or SSZ. Placebo subjects who did not 
experience ≥20% improvement in SJC and TJC by Week 16 (i.e., met early escape (EE) criteria were 
required to transition early to active treatment and were re-randomized 1:1 in a blinded fashion to 
apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID. Subjects on active treatment who met EE criteria continued to 
receive, in a blinded fashion, the same dose of apremilast to which they were originally assigned. After 24 
weeks of treatment, all of the subjects in the placebo group who had not entered EE at Week 16 were to 
be re-randomized 1:1 to receive 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID of apremilast, again stratified for DMARD use 
(yes/no).  
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding to treatment assignment was maintained at all study sites until after the Week 52 database lock 
at Year 1, after all final analyses were completed and the final results were released. At that time, 
open-label study medication was to be provided. Subjects who were receiving apremilast at Week 24 (i.e., 
those who were originally randomized to the APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID treatment groups, and those who 
entered EE at Week 16) continued to receive their randomized apremilast treatments in a blinded fashion. 
Statistical methods 
The evaluation of efficacy of apremilast was based on the results from the individual studies. Efficacy 
endpoints were analyzed at both the Week 16 (the timing of the primary endpoint) and Week 24 time 
points during the placebo-controlled period for each individual study. Handling of early escape at Week 16 
and missing values at Week 16 and Week 24 was consistent for all four studies. The statistical methods 
were identical in each of the studies with the exception of adjustment for stratification factors. In the 
three pivotal Phase 3 studies only (PSA-002, PSA-003, and PSA-004), the treatment comparisons were 
adjusted for strata of baseline DMARD use (yes/no) and baseline BSA involvement with psoriasis (<3% 
and ≥3%; the latter for Study PSA-004 only). The secondary endpoints at Weeks 16 and 24 in Studies 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 93/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA-004, and PSA-005 were analyzed in a hierarchical fashion to control the Type I 
error rate, as outlined in the studies’ statistical analysis plans. 
Results 
Participant flow 
There were 1493 subjects randomised and treated across the 3 pivotal studies and are included in the FAS 
(496 placebo, 500 APR 20 BID, 497 APR 30 BID) (Table 21). 
Disposition of Subjects During the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0-24) 
The disposition of subjects during the placebo-controlled phase (Weeks 0-24) of the pivotal Phase 3 
studies was generally comparable across treatment groups and across the individual Studies. In the 
pooled analysis, the majority (92.9%) of subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 studies completed Week 16 (the 
time of the primary endpoint) (93.1%, 93.2%, and 92.4% in the placebo, APR 20 BID, and APR 30 BID 
treatment groups, respectively). The most frequently cited reasons for study discontinuation prior to 
Week 16 were AEs (2.8%, 3.0%, and 5.0% of subjects in the placebo, APR 20 BID, and APR 30 BID 
treatment groups, respectively), withdrawal by subject (1.6%, 1.8%, and 0.8%, respectively), and lack 
of efficacy (1.4%, 1.4%, and 0.8%, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects entering EE at Week 16 decreased in a treatment- and dose-dependent 
manner (58.9%, 42.6%, and 35.2% of subjects in the placebo, APR 20 BID, and APR 30 BID treatment 
groups, respectively).

Disposition of Subjects During the Active-Treatment/Long-term Safety Phase (Weeks 24-52) 
There was some variability across the pivotal Phase 3 studies with regard to the disposition of subjects 
during Weeks 24-52. However, the trends observed across the treatment groups were generally 
consistent with the pooled analyses. In subjects initially randomised to apremilast who entered the Week 
24-52 study period, the proportions of subjects completing Week 52 were comparable between the APR 
20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups (89.6% and 88.7%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment 
groups were lack of efficacy (3.9% and 4.6%, respectively), withdrawal by subject (3.4% and2.6%, 
respectively), and AEs (2.4% in both groups). 
Overall Disposition of Subjects (Weeks 0-52) 
The overall rates of completion of Weeks 0-52 in subjects initially randomised to the APR 20 BID and APR 
30 BID treatment groups were 73.8% (369/500) and 74.4% (370/497), respectively. Additionally, 73.2% 
(363/496) of subjects randomised to the placebo group completed Weeks 0-52 (this included 111 
subjects in the PBO/20 EE group, 112 subjects in the PBO/30 EE group, 67 subjects in the PBO/20 XO 
group, and 73 subjects in the PBO/30 XO treatment group). These overall completion rates were 
consistent with the completion rates in the individual pivotal Phase 3 studies.

Conduct of the study 
All three studies had 6 protocol amendments the most significant of which was Protocol Amendment 6 (03 
July 2012) where the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR 20) was made at Week 16 instead 
of Week 24. Study PSA005 had 5 protocol amendments were implemented including extending blinded 
treatment duration with apremilast from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. 
Baseline data 
Comparison of populations in Studies PSA 002, PSA003 and PSA004 
The demographic characteristics of subjects at baseline were generally well-balanced across the studies 
PSA002, PSA003 and PSA004 treatment groups. There was some minor variability across the study 
populations with a higher proportion of female subjects in two of the three studies (PSA-003 (57%) and 
PSA-004 (53%)   and the distribution of subjects by geographic region varied across the three pivotal 
Phase 3 studies. Otherwise in terms of demographic characteristics the three studies were generally 
similar.

When pooling Studies PSA002, 003 and 004 the FAS comprised 1493 patients; 496 in the placebo group 
and 500 in the APR20mg BID group and 497 in the APR30mg BID group. 
The majority of subjects enrolled in this study were white (93.6%) and 53.5% of all subjects were female; 
the mean age was 50.3 years, and the mean weight was 85.65 kg (mean body mass index [BMI] was 
29.94 kg/m2). In the pooled analysis, the greatest proportion of subjects were from Europe (44.5% 
versus 33.7% from North America and 21.8% from the rest of the world). 
The disease history of subjects was generally well-balanced across treatment groups in the three studies 
and the pooled analysis. The proportion of patients with predominant spondylitis 32/1439 (2.1%) reflects 
the relative proportion of patients with this PsA subtype within the general PsA population. In the 
predominant spondylitis subgroup 3/12 (25%) of APR30mg BID vs 2/7 (28.6%) placebo had a treatment 
effect in favour of placebo.

Baseline Disease History (FAS) pooled analysis  
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Baseline disease activity, per the ACR component scores, was consistent with a subject population with 
active PsA. The mean (median) TJC was 21.0 (16.0) and the mean (median) SJC was 11.3 (9.0), and was 
consistent across treatment groups. Subjects had impaired physical function, as indicated by mean 
(median) HAQ-DI score of 1.178 (1.250). There was consistency observed across the VAS assessment 
scores for the mean (median) subject’s assessment of pain (56.8 [58.5]), PGA (56.2 [58.0]), and EGA 
(54.8 [55.0]). Other baseline disease activity measures, including the SF-36v2 physical functioning 
domain, CDAI, DAS28 (CRP), FACIT-Fatigue, MASES, and Dactylitis severity scores, were likewise 
indicative of a subject population with active PsA, and these were generally well-balanced across 
treatment groups in the pooled analysis and across the three pivotal Phase 3 studies.

(a) Subjects who discontinued early prior to Week 16 and subjects who did not have sufficient data for a definitive determianation of 
responses status at Week 16 were counted as nonresponders.  Joints temporarily or permanently not assessable at baseline were 
excluded from joint count.  For other unassessed joints at baseline, the joint assessment at the Screening visit, if assessed, was used 
as the Baseline assessment; otherwise, the joint was excluded from joint count.The last observed joint assessment (at baseline or 
postbaseline) was used for joints unassessed at Week 16.  There was no imputation for other missing ACR component scores. 
Table 28: Proportion of Subjects Achieving A Modified ACR 20 Response at Weeks 16 and 24 
(Pooled Analysis; FAS; NRI) 
Apremilast-exposure Period (Weeks 0-52) 
In all three pivotal Phase 3 studies, the analysis of the modified ACR 20 in the AAR Population (using data 
as observed) was supportive of the results presented above for the FAS (using NRI) outlined above. 
Response rates generally improved between Weeks 24 to 52 of treatment in subjects initially randomized 
to the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups, based on the data available at each visit (see Figure 
2 below for the pooled analysis). At Week 52, the modified ACR 20 response rates observed in the APR 20 
BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups were generally comparable, ranging from 52.9% to 63.0% in the 
APR 20 BID treatment group and from 52.6% to 63.0% in the APR 30 BID treatment group across the 
three studies. Placebo subjects who did achieve a ≥ 20% improvement in TJC and SJC at week 16 
continued to receive placebo until Week 24, at which time they were switched to apremilast (PBO/20 XO 
and PBO/30 XO groups). These patients showed a high placebo response at Week 16, particularly for the 
modified ACR 20, which started to decline by Week 24 but consistently outperforms both APR treatment 
groups across all three studies and the in the pooled analysis.

Improvement in Physical Function 
Key Secondary Endpoint (Change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 16) 
Change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 16 was identified as a key secondary endpoint. Statistically 
significant improvement (reduction) from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 16 (the key secondary 
endpoint) was seen in the APR 30 BID treatment group in all three pivotal Phase 3 studies and in the APR 
20 BID treatment group in two studies (PSA-002 and PSA-003). 
Table 29 - Change from Baseline in the HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 16 and 24 (Pooled Analysis; 
FAS; LOCF) 
At Week 52, the mean change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score ranged from -0.192 to -0.369 in the APR 
20 BID treatment group and from -0.318 to -0.350 in the APR 30 BID treatment group.  
MCID for HAQ-DI for PSA has not been fully evaluated. The improvements in the HAQ-DI score observed 
in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups exceeded the estimated MCID of -0.13 provided by 
the Kwok, 2010 study   but not the estimated –MCID of -0.3 and -0.35  provided in two  Mease studies 
[Mease, 2004a and Mease 2011] . 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Modified ACR 50/70 endpoint  
In all three pivotal Phase 3 studies, numerically greater proportions of subjects treated with apremilast 
achieved a modified ACR 50 at both time points compared with placebo. The treatment effect at Week 16 
in modified ACR 50 was nominally significant for the APR 20 BID treatment group in Studies PSA-002

(26/168 (15.5) p= 0.0049) and PSA-003 (24/163 (14.7) p= 0.0034) and for the APR 30 BID treatment 
group in Study PSA-002 (27/168 (16.1) p= 0.0027). This is maintained at Week 24 in both apremilast 
treatment groups, and nominally significant for the APR 20 BID group in Study PSA-002, and APR 30 BID 
group in Studies PSA-002 and PSA-004 (Table 23 and 25). 
The proportions of subjects achieving modified ACR 70 responses at Week 16 were nominally significant 
in the APR 20 BID treatment group (10/168 (6.0%) p= 0.0192) at Week 16 and the APR 20 BID (9/168 
(5.4%) p= 0.0104) and APR30 BID (17/168 (10.1%) p= 0.0001) groups at week 24 in Stud PSA-002 
only.

Pain 
Subject’s Assessment of Pain Score 
Statistically significantly greater improvements in the subject’s assessment of pain score, compared with 
placebo, were observed at Week 16 in the APR 30 BID treatment group in Studies PSA-002 and PSA-004. 
These improvements were generally maintained at Week 24. A dose effect was observed in two of the 
three studies (PSA-002 and PSA-004). The MCID of a 10-mm improvement (reduction) from baseline 
(Dworkin, 2008) was exceeded at Week 16 in the APR 20 BID treatment group in Studies PSA-002 and 
PSA-003, and in the APR 30 BID treatment group in all three studies and were generally maintained at 
Week 24.  
Non articular symptoms Enthesitis, Dactylitis and Psoriasis 
The ACR criteria and other composite responder indices (e.g.  PsARC and the EULAR response criteria) 
have discriminated between placebo and treatment response. However, they do not incorporate skin, and 
entheseal involvement. Response rates were evaluated in patients with pre-existing enthesitis and 
Dactylitis at baseline. In the pooled analysis the mean reduction in MASES from baseline in the APR 30 
BID treatment group was nominally significantly greater compared with the placebo group at week 24. 
(-1.4 p= 0.0194). 
In subjects with pre-existing dactylitis, in the pooled analysis nominally significantly greater mean 
reductions (indicating improvement) in dactylitis severity score were observed in the APR30 BID 
treatment group, compared with placebo, at Weeks 16 (-1.7 p= 0.049 ) and 24 (-1.8 p= 0.0097). 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 102/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In the pivotal Phase 3 studies, PASI-75 response rates at week 16 were nominally significant compared 
with placebo for the APR20 BID and APR30 BID groups in all three studies with the response for the 30 mg 
BID group in PSA-004 achieving statistical significance at week 16. Response rates were 4.5% to 5.7% for 
PBO and 18.8% to 20.9% for APR20BID and 22.1-22.2% for APR30 BID groups respectively. These 
response rates were maintained through week 24 and from week 24-52. At Week 52, the PASI-75 
response rates were 24.5% to 28.6% in the APR 20 BID treatment group and 36.8% to 39.3% in the APR 
30 BID treatment group. Similar responses were seen for PASI-50. A dose effect in favour of APR30 BID 
for the PASI-50 and PASI-75 response was observed at Week 52 in all three studies.  
SF-36v2 Physical Functioning Domain Score 
Statistically significant improvements (increases), compared with placebo, in the SF-36v2 physical 
functioning domain score at Week 16 in the APR 30 BID treatment group in all three pivotal Phase 3 
studies and in the APR 20 BID treatment group in Study PSA-002.  
FACIT-fatigue Score  
At baseline, the mean FACIT-F scores were 29.9. Mean change from baseline were nominally statistically 
significant across the APR 30 BID groups in all studies PSA 002,003 and 004 at weeks 16 and 24 although 
values recorded at week 24 across all three studies were slightly lower than those recorded at week 16 
suggesting a slight diminution of effect.  
BASDAI Assessments 
Axial involvement, a common secondary feature of peripheral predominant PsA disease, was present in 
37% (548/1493) of subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 program. This subgroup had a mean (median) 
baseline BASDAI score of 5.95 (6.17). In the pooled analysis, a nominally significantly greater reduction 
(improvement) in the BASDAI score was observed in the APR 30 BID treatment group, compared with 
placebo, at Weeks 16 (-0.57 p=0.0173 )and 24 (-0.853 p=0.0002). The number of patients with 
predominantly spondylitic subtypes of psoriatic arthritis( 2.1% of study poopulation) was too small to 
allow meaningful assessment. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well

double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase,  and  a  236-week  active 
treatment/long-term  safety  phase  consisting  of  2  parts  (a 
randomized,  double-blind  active  treatment  phase  of  at  least  28 
weeks ‘duration, and an open-label, long-term safety phase of up to 
4 years’ duration), for an overall study 
Duration of 5 years. 
Duration of main phase:

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Prior DMARD use 
Both the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups had greater modified ACR 20 responses at Week 
16 versus placebo, irrespective of the number or type of prior small-molecule or biologic DMARDs used, 
including subjects who had had a therapeutic failure to biologics. These treatment effects were generally 
maintained at Week 24.

Analysis; FAS; NRI) 
Baseline (Concomitant) DMARD Use 
Higher modified ACR 20 responses were observed in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups 
compared with placebo at Week 16, irrespective of whether apremilast was given alone or in combination 
with small-molecule DMARDs. Treatment effect ended to be higher in the non-MTX subgroup compared 
with the MTX treated subgroup even though the change from baseline was lower than that seen in the 
MTX treated group.

Supportive Study 
Study PSA-005 is an ongoing phase 3 parallel group study in 528 subjects with active PsA. It differs from 
the pivotal three Phase 3 studies in that subjects enrolled in Study PSA-005 have not been previously 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 110/189 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
treated with a DMARD, and concomitant DMARDs, including MTX, LEF, and SSZ, were prohibited. It has a 
similar design to the pivotal phase studies. A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the 
APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups achieved a modified ACR 20 response at Week 16 (the 
primary endpoint) compared with placebo (28.0% and 30.7%, respectively, versus 15.9%; p = 0.0062 
and 0.0010, respectively). Statistically significant modified ACR 20 responses at Week 24 for APR 20 BID 
and APR 30BID treated subjects. (29.1% and 24.4%, respectively, versus placebo at 13.1%; p = 0.0002 
and p = 0.0063, respectively). 
The results of Study PSA-005 are broadly in line with the results of the three pivotal studies. 
PLAQUE PSORIASIS 
The pivotal Phase 3 studies of apremilast for monotherapy use in psoriasis (Studies PSOR-008 and 
PSOR-009) utilized a similar study design and are described below. 
Study PSOR-008 (ESTEEM 1): A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
efficacy and safety study of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
Study PSOR-009 (ESTEEM 2): A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
efficacy and safety study of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
Methods 
A total of 1257 subjects were enrolled across both studies. These studies consist of 4 treatment phases 
(see Figure 5 and 6): a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase; a 16-week 
double-blind maintenance phase; a 20-week randomized, double-blind treatment withdrawal phase; and 
a 208-week, open-label long-term safety extension phase. Overall study duration is 5 years. The 
application contains data from the initial 52 weeks of dosing, spanning the first 3 treatment phases. The 
long-term extension phases across both studies are ongoing.

Study Participants  
Subjects enrolled in these studies needed to have a diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with 
the following eligibility criteria at baseline: 
o  ≥ 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement 
o  PASI score ≥ 12  
o 
o 
candidates for systemic and/or phototherapy.  
sPGA score ≥ 3 (moderate or greater) at baseline, and being candidates for 
The study population included subjects who were either treatment naïve or who had received 
phototherapy and/or systemic therapy and who were considered appropriate candidates for systemic 
therapy based on the European S3-Guidelines. The use of concomitant psoriasis therapies, other than a 
limited spectrum of topical agents, was not allowed during the Placebo-controlled and the Maintenance 
Phases. Only low potency corticosteroids for the face, axillae, and groin; coal-tar shampoo and salicylic 
acid preparations for the scalp; and unmedicated skin moisturiser for body lesions were permitted. These 
topical therapies were not to be used within 24 hours prior to a study visit. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomised to receive APR 30 mg twice daily (APR 30 BID) or identically-appearing 
placebo during the 16-week Placebo-controlled Phase. In accordance with the titration schedule, subjects 
in the APR 30 mg BID treatment group reached the target dose on the sixth day of treatment. At Week 16, 
all subjects originally assigned to placebo were transitioned in a blinded fashion to receive APR 30 mg BID 
and dose-titrated during their first 6 days of active treatment, while subjects originally assigned to APR 30 
BID continued to receive APR 30 BID in a blinded fashion up to Week 32 (Maintenance Phase). 
In Study PSOR-008 at Week 32 (Randomised Treatment Withdrawal Phase), subjects originally 
randomised to APR 30 mg BID at baseline who had achieved a PASI-75 response were re-randomised to 
either APR 30 mg BID or placebo to evaluate time to first loss of PASI-75 response. Subjects who were 
re-randomised to placebo and lost their PASI-75 response restarted APR 30 mg BID without re-titration. 
In Study PSOR-009 a different definition of responder, a loss of effect in the Randomised Treatment 
Withdrawal phase was utilised. Consequently, at Week 32 (Randomised Treatment Withdrawal Phase), 
subjects originally randomised to APR 30 mg BID at baseline who had achieved a PASI-50 response at 
Week 32, were re-randomised to either APR 30 mg BID or placebo to evaluate the time to first loss of 50% 
of the Week 32 PASI improvement compared to baseline. Subjects who were re-randomised to placebo 
and lost 50% of their Week 32 PASI response restarted APR 30 mg BID without re-titration. 
Subjects who had been randomised to APR 30 mg BID at baseline and who did not achieve a PASI-75 
response in Study PSOR-008 or a PASI-50 response in Study PSOR-009 were not re-randomised in the 
Randomised Treatment Withdrawal Phase. In addition, all subjects who had been randomised to placebo 
at baseline were not re-randomised in the Randomised Treatment Withdrawal Phase regardless of their 
PASI response. Subjects who were not re-randomised continued to receive APR 30 mg BID up to Week 
52. Subjects who did not achieve a PASI-75 response in Study PSOR-008 or a PASI-50 response in Study 
PSOR-009 at Week 32 were given the option of adding topical and/or UVB phototherapy to APR 30 mg BID 
treatment at the investigator’s discretion at Week 32 only, but therapy could be initiated at any time 
during Weeks 32 to 52. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 112/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The primary objective of the pivotal studies was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of APR 30 mg BID 
compared with placebo, in subjects with moderate to severe plaque PSOR. 
Secondary: 
The secondary objectives of the pivotal studies were to: 
- Evaluate the safety and tolerability of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, in subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque PSOR 
- Evaluate the effect of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, on quality of life in subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque PSOR 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of subjects treated with either APR 30 mg BID or 
placebo who achieved a PASI-75 response at Week 16 compared to baseline. 
The major secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects treated with either APR 30mg  BID or 
placebo with an sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline 
at Week 16 (Feldman, 2005). 
Other endpoints: Body Surface Area; Pruritus Visual Analog Scale Assessment; Dermatology Life Quality 
Index; Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale; Nail Psoriasis Severity Index; Scalp Physician 
Global Assessment; Palmoplantar Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment; Medical Outcome Study Short 
Form 36-item Health Survey; European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire; Work Limitations 
Questionnaire-25. 
Sample size 
Approximately 825 subjects were to be randomised into PSOR-008, with 550 subjects in APR 30 mg BID 
arm and 275 subjects in the placebo arm and 405 subjects were to be randomised into PSOR-009, with 
270 subjects on APR 30 mg BID and 135 on placebo. Sample size estimation for the primary endpoint was 
based on results of the Phase 2b study, PSOR-005. A chi-square test with a 0.05 2-sided significance level 
provided 90% power to detect a 20% difference (30% versus 10%) between APR 30 mg BID and placebo 
for the proportion of subjects achieving at least a PASI-75 at Week 16 when the total sample size was 
approximately 189 with a 2:1 randomisation. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using the 
IVRS. After 16 weeks of treatment, all subjects originally randomised to placebo were switched to receive 
apremilast 30 mg BID. In order to evaluate the time to relapse/loss of effect, at Week 32, subjects who 
were initially randomised to apremilast 30 mg BID and had achieved a response, were re-randomised to 
either placebo or apremilast 30 mg BID in a 1:1 ratio. No stratification factor was utilized in these studies. 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding was maintained by the use of identical blister cards for all subjects. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods and missing data handling approaches were identical in the two individual studies. 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, PASI-75 response at Week 16 was compared between APR 
30 mg BID and placebo using LOCF and a two-sided Chi-Square test. Supportive analyses were performed 
for: (1) FAS population treating missing values as nonresponders (NRI), (2) FAS population treating 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

dropouts due to adverse event or lack of efficacy as non-responders and other dropouts using LOCF, (3) 
PP population using LOCF method for imputing missing values, (4) Analyses using CMH test stratified by 
pooled sites for FAS population using LOCF method for imputing missing values. The major secondary 
endpoint, sPGA response, was analyzed similarly, conditioned on observing a statistically significant 
result for the primary endpoint.

Conduct of the study 
In study PSOR-008 the changes to the protocol included 4 protocol amendments. 
In study PSOR-009 the changes to the protocol included 3 protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of subjects at baseline were similar across studies, were generally well 
balanced across treatment groups, and were representative of a typical population in psoriasis clinical 
trials (Table 32). In Study PSOR-008 and Study PSOR-009, the majority of subjects were white (89.7% 
and 92.0%, respectively) and male (67.9% and 67.2%, respectively) with a median age of 46.0 years. 
Generally, mean weight and mean BMI were comparable across Study PSOR-008 (93.38 kg and 31.26 
kg/m2, respectively) and Study PSOR-009 (91.10 kg and 30.80 kg/m2, respectively). Additionally, in 
both studies, approximately one-half of subjects were obese (≥ 30 kg/m2) and one-fourth of subjects 
were morbidly obese (≥ 35 kg/m2).  
In general, the patient demographic profile of Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 was considered 
comparable to patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Approximately one third of subjects in Study 
PSOR-008 were from US sites and about one-third from Canadian sites; approximately 14% each were 
from sites in Europe and the Rest of World. In Study PSOR-009, approximately 50%, 22%, and 28% of 
subjects were from sites in the US, Canada, and Europe, respectively.

Baseline Disease History and Characteristics 
The disease history and disease activity of subjects was generally well balanced across studies and 
between treatment groups (Table 34). In Study PSOR-008, the median duration of plaque psoriasis was 
16.95 years (mean of 19.40 years). Almost all of the subjects (95.9%) had a history of scalp psoriasis and 
the majority of subjects had a history of nail psoriasis (68.5%). The median BSA affected was 20.00% 
(mean of 24.71%) and the median PASI score at baseline was 16.80 (mean of 18.95). The majority of 
subjects (70.3%) had a sPGA score of 3 (moderate), and more than 99% had 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) 
sPGA at baseline. 
In Study PSOR-009, the median duration of plaque psoriasis (time elapsed since diagnosis) was 15.80 
years (mean of 18.19 years). Almost all of the subjects (92.7%) had a history of scalp psoriasis and the 
majority of subjects had a history of nail psoriasis (67.6%). The median BSA affected was 21.50% (mean 
of 26.17%) and the median PASI score at baseline was 16.80 (mean of 19.30). The majority of subjects 
(69.6%) had an sPGA score of 3 (moderate), and more than 99% had 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) sPGA 
at baseline. 
Approximately 30% of subjects in both studies had severe disease, as measured by an sPGA of 4 (severe) 
or a PASI > 20. In addition, approximately 50% or more of the subjects in each study had a BSA 
involvement of > 20%, another measure of severe disease.

Prior Use of Psoriasis-related Therapies 
The psoriasis-related therapies that were previously used by subjects prior to enrolment in the study were 
similar across the 2 studies and were generally well balanced across treatment groups (Table 35). In both 
studies,  approximately  55%  of  the  subjects  had  been  treated  previously  with  systemic  therapy  (i.e., 
conventional  systemic  and/or  biologics).  Approximately  40%  of  subjects  were previously  treated  with 
conventional systemic therapies (including treatment failures), approximately 30% had prior exposure to 
biologics  (including  treatment  failures),  and  17%  to  29%  had  prior  exposure  to  TNF  blockers. 
Approximately  one-third  of  subjects  had  received  prior  phototherapy.  Approximately  one-third  of  the

subjects (35.2% in Study PSOR-008 and 35.8% in Study PSOR-009) were naive to prior systemic and/or 
phototherapy.

Outcomes and estimation 
Comparison of Results of Individual Studies 
The individual study results from Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 are presented side-by-side in this 
section to demonstrate the consistency of effect observed with apremilast in the treatment of subjects 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75% 
reduction from baseline in the PASI score (PASI-75) at Week 16 (Table 38 and Figure 9).

PSOR-009 (FAS; LOCF). 
Figure 9 - Proportion of Subjects Achieving a PASI-75 at Week 16 in Studies PSOR-008 and 
PSOR-009 (FAS; LOCF) 
In both studies, a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment 
group achieved the primary endpoint, compared with placebo (p < 0.0001 for both studies), as evaluated 
using the primary analysis method (ie, missing values at Week 16 imputed using LOCF). The response 
rates for the placebo and APR 30 BID treatment groups were 5.3% and 33.1%, respectively, in Study 
PSOR-008 and were 5.8% and 28.8%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009. In both studies, the placebo 
response rates were low, as typically observed in well-conducted psoriasis trials. 
Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Endpoint 
The results for the primary endpoint were supported by the sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the 
impact of missing data in the: 
1.  FAS  population  treating  subjects  with  missing  values  as  nonresponders  (nonresponder 
imputation [NRI]) 
2.  FAS population treating dropouts due to an AE or lack of efficacy as nonresponders and other 
dropouts using LOCF 
3.  PP population using the LOCF method for imputing missing values 
4.  FAS population using the LOCF method for imputing values stratified by geographical region, and 
5.  FAS population using the LOCF method for imputing values stratified by pooled sites.

All these sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar results and statistically significant differences between 
the APR 30 mg BID treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (p <0.0001 for all 
sensitivity analyses). Additionally, the potential for site treatment interaction was analyzed by pooling 
sites within each region to create “sites” that had a prespecified minimum of 30 subjects (site pooling is 
discussed in the individual study statistical analysis plans. This analysis demonstrated statistically 
significant treatment differences in both studies for the APR 30 mg BID treatment group compared with 
the placebo treatment group, results that were similar to the analysis using a chi-square test (Table 39). 
Table  39:  Sensitivity  Analyses  for  Primary  Endpoint  (PASI-75  Response  at  Week  16)  for 
Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 
Major Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The major secondary endpoint in both studies was the proportion of subjects achieving sPGA score of 0 
(clear) or 1 (almost clear), with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16. 
In both studies, a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment 
group achieved the endpoint compared with placebo (p < 0.0001) (Table 40 and Figure 10). The response 
rates in the placebo and APR 30 BID treatment groups were 3.9% and 21.7%, respectively, in Study 
PSOR-008, and were 4.4% and 20.4%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009.

Week 16) in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 (FAS; LOCF) 
Sensitivity Analyses for the Major Secondary Endpoint 
The results for the major secondary endpoint were supported by the same sensitivity analyses conducted 
for the primay endpoint. 
These sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar results and statistically significant differences for the APR 
30  mg BID treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (p <0.0001 for all sensitivity 
analyses). 
Additionally, the potential for site treatment interaction was analyzed by pooling sites within each region 
to create “sites” that had a prespecified minimum of 30 subjects. The 2-sided p-value was >0.05 in both 
studies, indicating no statistically significant interaction. Among sensitivity analyses, the CMH test 
adjusted by pooled site was performed for sPGA. This analysis demonstrated statistically significant 
treatment differences in both studies for the APR 30 mg BID treatment group compared with the placebo 
treatment group, results that were similar to the analysis using achi-square test (Table 41).

Table 41: Sensitivity Analyses for the Major Secondary Endpoint (sPGA Response at Week 16) 
for Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009. 
Endpoints in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 were analyzed in a hierarchical fashion to control the Type 
I error rate, as outlined in the studies’ statistical analysis plans (Section 10.2 of the PSOR-008 SAP serves 
as a representative example). 
Composite Endpoint: PASI-75 and sPGA Response at Week 16 
The composite endpoint was defined as the number of subjects who achieved both a PASI-75 and sPGA 
scores of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16. 
In both pivotal studies, a nominally significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID 
treatment group achieved the composite endpoint at Week 16 compared with placebo (nominal p < 
0.0001) (Table 42). Similar findings were observed in the PP population.

Percent Change in Body Surface Area Involvement From Baseline at Week 16 
Affected BSA is a measure of the percentage of BSA that is covered by psoriasis lesions, with >20% being 
a measure of “severe” disease (Winterfield, 2004). The mean affected BSA involvement in both studies 
was approximately 25% at baseline. Approximately half of the subjects had a baseline BSA >20%. 
In both pivotal studies, subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID achieved statistically significant 
improvement (reduction) in the change from baseline in psoriasis affected BSA at Week 16 compared with 
placebo (p <0.0001) (Table 43). The mean percent changes from baseline in BSA involvement for the 
placebo and APR 30 mg BID treatment groups were -6.94% and -47.80%, respectively, in Study 
PSOR-008 and were -6.14% and -48.45%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009.

Percent Change in PASI Score From Baseline at Week 16 
In both pivotal studies, subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID achieved a statistically significant 
improvement (reduction) in PASI score from baseline at Week 16 compared with placebo (p <0.0001). 
The mean percent changes in PASI score for the placebo and APR 30 mg BID treatment groups were 
-16.7% and -52.1%, respectively, in Study PSOR-008, and were -15.8% and -50.9%, respectively, in 
Study PSOR-009 (Table 44). The median percent changes in PASI score for the placebo and APR 30 mg 
BID treatment groups were -14.0% and -59.0%, respectively, in Study PSOR-008, and were -18.0% and 
-56.0%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009.

Change in Pruritus VAS Score From Baseline at Week 16: 
The subject population was highly pruritic at baseline, with a mean Pruritus VAS score ranging from about 
65 to 68 mm in the treatment groups for the 2 studies. In both pivotal studies, subjects treated with APR 
30 mg BID achieved a statistically significant improvement (reduction) in the Pruritus VAS score at Week 
16 compared with placebo (p <0.0001) (Table 45). The mean decrease of 31.5 mm for the APR 30 mg BID 
treatment group at Week 16 in Study PSOR-008 and the mean decrease of 33.5 mm in Study PSOR-009 
represented about a 50% decrease in pruritus severity from baseline. In both studies, rapid and clinically 
meaningful responses were observed as early as Week 2 of APR 30 mg BID treatment based on 
differences (non-overlapping CIs) in the mean change in Pruritus VAS between treatment groups. 
Table 45: Change in Pruritus VAS Score From Baseline at Week 16 in Studies PSOR-008 and 
PSOR-009 (FAS; LOCF) 
Change in DLQI Total Score from Baseline at Week 16 
The mean DLQI Total Scores at baseline were approximately 12.5 in both pivotal studies, indicating a 
significant impact of psoriasis on the subjects’ quality of life. In both studies, subjects treated with APR 30

mg BID achieved statistically significant improvement (reduction) in the DLQI Total Score at Week 16 
compared with placebo (p <0.0001). 
The mean changes from baseline were -2.1 and -6.6 for subjects treated with placebo or APR 30 mg BID, 
respectively, in Study PSOR-008 and were -2.8 and -6.7, respectively, in Study PSOR-009. The mean 
improvement at Week 16 for the APR 30 mg BID treatment group of 6.6 in Study PSOR-008, and 6.7 in 
Study PSOR-009, exceeded the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of at least a 5-point 
decrease from baseline (Finlay, 1994; NICE, 2012). 
The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 5-point decrease in DLQI in the placebo and APR 30 BID 
treatment groups were 33.5% and 70.2%, respectively, in Study PSOR-008, and were 42.9% and 70.8%, 
respectively, in Study PSOR-009. 
Visual Analog Scales 
Improvements in the subjects’ self-assessment of various aspects of their disease as measured by VAS 
were observed in subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16. 
Subjects treated with APR 30 BID achieved nominally significant improvements (decreases) in both 
studies in the Skin Discomfort/Pain VAS score at Week 16 compared with placebo (nominal p <0.0001) 
(Table 46). The mean decreases of 28.3 mm and 28.5 mm for the APR 30 mg BID treatment group at 
Week 16 in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, respectively, represented about a 50% decrease in Skin 
Discomfort/Pain from baseline. 
Subjects treated with APR 30 BID achieved nominally significant improvements (decreases) in both 
studies in Subject’s Global Assessment of Psoriasis Disease Activity VAS score at Week 16 compared with 
placebo (nominal p <0.0001). 
In Study PSOR-008, 20.5% of subjects entered study with PsA at baseline and in Study PSOR-009, 13.4% 
of subjects entered study with PsA at baseline. Subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID in Study PSOR-008 
achieved nominally significant improvements in PsA Disease Activity. 
VAS score at Week 16 compared with placebo (nominal p = 0.0033). The improvements (decreases) in 
Study PSOR-009 were numerically greater for the APR 30 BID treatment group compared with the 
placebo treatment group (p = 0.1618).

Health-related Quality of Life 
Improvements in measures of quality of life were generally observed with APR 30 BID treatment 
compared to placebo at Week 16 in both studies. 
Nail Assessments 
Overall, 558 of the 844 subjects (66%) enrolled in Study PSOR-008 and 266 of the 411 subjects (64.7%) 
enrolled in Study PSOR-009 had nail psoriasis at baseline (Table 47). Among these subjects, a statistically 
significant improvement (reduction) in NAPSI score from baseline was detected in subjects treated with 
APR 30 BID at Week 16 compared with placebo (p <0.0001, Study PSOR-008, p = 0.0052, Study 
PSOR-009). The percent mean change from baseline at Week 16 for placebo-treated subjects was 6.5% 
and -7.1% in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, respectively, and for apremilast-treated subjects was 
-22.5% and -29.0% in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, respectively.

Scalp Psoriasis 
Overall, 563 of the 844 subjects enrolled in Study PSOR-008 and 269 of the 411 subjects enrolled in 
Study PSOR-009 had moderate or more severe scalp psoriasis at Baseline (ScPGA ≥3). Among these 
subjects, a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID achieved 
an ScPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) at Week 16 compared with placebo (p <0.0001) in both pivotal 
studies (Table 48).  
The proportion of subjects with an ScPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) were 17.5% and 46.5% for 
placebo and APR 30 mg BID treatment groups, respectively, in Study PSOR-008 and were 17.2% and 
40.9%, respectively in Study PSOR-009. A nominally significantly greater proportion of subjects treated 
with APR 30 mg BID achieved improvements in the ScPGA score of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, or mild) at 
Week 16 compared with placebo (nominal p <0.0001) in both studies.  
The response rates for a ScPGA score of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, or mild) were 35.4% and 68.7% for 
placebo and APR 30 mg BID treatment groups, respectively, in Study PSOR-008 and were 41.9% and 
67.0%, respectively in Study PSOR-009.

Palmoplantar Psoriasis 
A total of 83 subjects in Study PSOR-008 and 42 subjects in Study PSOR-009 had moderate or severe 
palmoplantar psoriasis (PPPGA Score of 3 or 4 [moderate or severe]) at baseline. 
Among subjects with a PPPGA baseline score ≥3 (moderate or greater) in Study PSOR-008, a larger 
proportion of subjects treated with APR 30 mg BID showed improvement in the palmoplantar psoriasis 
(PPPGA score to 0 or 1[clear or almost clear]) compared with placebo (Table 49). This difference was 
numerically greater in Study PSOR-008 (p = 0.4912) and nominally significantly greater in Study 
PSOR-009 (nominal p = 0.0315).

Maintenance Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
For both studies, the PASI-75 response rates for subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID peaked 
around Week 16 and were generally maintained through Week 32. Subjects originally randomized to 
placebo demonstrated a response to apremilast treatment, similar to that seen for subjects originally 
randomized to APR 30 mg BID at baseline. By Week 24, the PASI response rates for subjects who were

originally randomized to placebo following 8 weeks of APR 30 BID treatment were generally comparable 
to those for subjects receiving 24 weeks of APR 30 mg BID. 
By Week 32, the PASI response rates for subjects who were originally randomized to placebo following 16 
weeks of APR 30 BID treatment were also generally comparable to those for subjects receiving 32 weeks 
of APR 30 BID (Table 50).

The sPGA response rates for subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID peaked around Week 16 in 
both studies and were generally maintained through Week 32. Subjects originally randomized to placebo 
demonstrated rapid sPGA response following initiation of apremilast treatment, similar to that seen for 
subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID at baseline. 
By Week 24, the response rates for subjects originally randomized to placebo following 8 weeks of APR 30 
BID treatment were similar to those for subjects who received 24 weeks of APR 30 BID (Table 51).

Body Surface Area Involvement 
At Week 32, after placebo subjects had been treated with APR 30 BID for 16 weeks, reductions in BSA 
involvement were similar between the treatment groups, and greater than the changes at Week 16. The 
mean percent changes (improvement) from baseline in BSA involvement for the placebo/APR 30 mg BID 
and APR 30 mg BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups were -59.25% and -61.18%, respectively, in Study 
PSOR-008 and -58.73% and -60.67%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009 (Table 52).

Dermatology Life Quality Index 
At Weeks 24 and 32 in both studies, subjects originally randomized to placebo achieved similar changes 
in DLQI Total Scores from baseline as did those subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID (Table 
53) and were greater than the changes observed at Week 16 (Table 54). Among subjects with a baseline 
DLQI Total Score >5, the proportion of subjects who achieved a decrease (improvement) of at least 5 
points from baseline (MCID; Finlay, 1994; NICE, 2012) at Weeks 24 and 32 was similar between the 
treatment groups in Study PSOR-008 (approximately60% of subjects). In the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID 
treatment group in Study PSOR-009, 59.3% and 50.9% of subjects achieved a decrease (improvement) 
of at least 5 points from baseline in DLQI Total Score (MCID) at Weeks 24 and 32, respectively, and in the 
placebo/APR 30 BID treatment group, 72.8% and 65.2% of subjects achieved at least a 5-point decrease 
in DLQI Total Score at Weeks 24 and 32, respectively.

Visual Analog Scales 
During the Maintenance Phase (Weeks 16 to 32), improvements in VAS-related endpoints were generally 
maintained in subjects who continued to receive apremilast (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID). Subjects who were 
originally randomized to placebo at Week 0 and transitioned to APR 30 BID at Week 16 (placebo/APR 30 
BID) achieved similar responses to those observed in subjects randomized to apremilast at the baseline 
visit (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID) and treated for 32 weeks. These responses were evident beginning at 
Week 24, following 8 weeks of apremilast therapy (Table 55). 
At Weeks 24 and 32, subjects in the placebo/APR 30 BID treatment groups achieved similar 
improvements (decreases) in the Pruritus VAS compared with subjects in the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID 
treatment group, with mean decreases of approximately 30 mm or greater in both studies. Similar 
improvements in the Skin Discomfort/Pain VAS (mean decreases of approximately 30 mm) were 
observed in both the placebo/APR 30 BID and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment group. 
In both studies, the pruritus and skin discomfort/pain responses in subjects originally randomized to APR 
30 BID were observed by Week 2, plateaued by about Week 8, and were maintained through Week 32. 
Subjects originally randomized to placebo demonstrated a similar rapid improvement in pruritus and skin 
discomfort/pain following initiation of apremilast treatment at Week 16, which was also maintained 
through Week 32.

Health-related Quality of Life 
Overall, improvements in health-related quality of life assessments were observed with apremilast 
treatment at Weeks 24 and 32. In both studies, subjects originally randomized to placebo at baseline and 
treated with APR 30 BID beginning at Week 16 achieved similar improvements (increases) in SF-36v2 
MCS by Weeks 24 and 32 as subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID. At Weeks 24 and 32, the 
mean changes for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment group exceeded the MCID of 2.5 in Study 
PSOR-008, and the mean changes for both treatment groups (placebo/APR 30 BID and APR 30 BID/APR 
30 BID) reached or exceeded the MCID of 2.5 in Study PSOR-009. 
Improvements in SF-36v2 PCS Scores reached or exceeded the MCID of 2.5 for the placebo/APR 30 BID 
treatment group in Study PSOR-009 at Weeks 24 and 32. 
In the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment group, improvements (decreases) in PHQ-8 Total 
Scores were generally maintained at Weeks 24 and 32. In the placebo/APR 30 BID treatment group, 
improvements (decreases) in PHQ-8 Total Score were evident by Week 24 and continued through Week 
32. 
Nail Assessments 
In both studies, subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID who had nail involvement at baseline 
achieved a greater improvement (reduction in total score) in overall NAPSI score at Weeks 24 and 32

compared with subjects originally randomized to placebo and then treated with APR 30 BID (Table 56). In 
addition, the subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID achieved even better (lower) NAPSI scores at 
Weeks 24 and 32 than at Week 16. This is expected, as longer treatment periods allow for a greater 
outgrowth of healthy nails leading to improved NAPSI scores. As such, the lower scores for subjects 
originally randomized to placebo are probably due to the shorter time on active treatment. In addition, a 
greater proportion of subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID achieved a NAPSI-50 at Weeks 24 and 
32 compared with subjects originally randomized to placebo. At Weeks 24 and 32, subjects originally 
randomized to APR 30 BID achieved a larger decrease in the number of involved nails, compared with 
subjects originally randomized to placebo.

Scalp Psoriasis 
Of the subjects with ScPGA score ≥ 3 (moderate or greater) at baseline, the proportion of subjects who 
achieved an improvement of ScPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) was numerically greater for the 
placebo/APR 30 BID group than for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID group at Weeks 24 and 32 (Table 57).   
The differences between the treatment groups were greater for Study PSOR-009 than Study PSOR-008. 
Similar findings were observed for subjects who achieved an improvement of ScPGA score of 0, 1, or 2 
(clear, minimal, or mild).

Palmoplantar Psoriasis 
Of the subjects with a PPPGA score ≥3 (moderate or greater) at baseline, the proportion of subjects who 
achieved an improvement of PPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) was numerically greater for the 
placebo/APR 30 BID group than for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID group at Weeks 24 and 32 (Table 58).

Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52). 
Subjects who were re-randomized were those subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID and 
achieved a PASI-75 response (Study PSOR-008) or at least a PASI-50 response (Study PSOR-009) at 
Week 32 , were re-randomized to either APR 30 mg BID or placebo in order to evaluate time to first loss 
of effect. 
Subjects who were not re-randomized were those subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID and did 
not achieve a PASI-75 response (Study PSOR-008) or at least a PASI-50 response (Study PSOR-009) at 
Week 32 or were those subjects originally randomized to placebo (regardless of response). In Study 
PSOR-008, there were 4 subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID who achieved a PASI-75 
response who were not re randomized at Week 32.In Study PSOR-009, there was one subject originally 
randomized to APR 30 BID who achieved a PASI-50 response who was not re randomized at Week 32.

Additionally, non responders (<PASI-50) in both studies and partial responders in Study PSOR-008 
(PASI-50 to PASI-74) had the option of adding topical medications and/or UVB rescue therapy beginning 
at Week 32 at the discretion of the investigator. 
Time to First Loss of PASI-75 Response (Loss of Effect in Study PSOR-008) 
The time to first loss of effect was defined in Study PSOR-008 as the time when loss of PASI-75 response 
first occurred after re randomization in the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Figure 11). In the 
Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase, 77 subjects were re-randomized to placebo (APR 30 BID/APR 
30 BID/placebo) and 77 subjects were re randomized to APR 30 BID (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID) at Week 32. 
Of the re-randomized subjects in the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 
30 BID treatment group, 63/77 subjects (81.8%) and 40/77 subjects (51.9%), respectively, lost PASI-75 
response at some time point during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase.  
The number of censored subjects (those subjects whose time to loss of PASI-75 could not be determined 
or who did not lose PASI-75 prior to Week 52) was 14 (18.2%) and 37 (48.1%) in the APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, respectively 
For the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, the 
median time to first loss of PASI-75 was 5.1 weeks and 17.7 weeks from the Week 32 re randomization, 
respectively (nominal p < 0.0001). 
Some subjects on APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID regained PASI-75 at later time points following 
loss of the response.

Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52) in Study PSOR-008 
Time to First Loss of 50% Improvement of PASI Score (Loss of Effect in Study PSOR-009). 
In contrast to PSOR-008, the time to first loss of effect in Study PSOR-009 was defined as loss of 50% of 
the improvement in PASI score obtained at Week 32 compared to baseline after re randomization in the 
Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Figure 12). Subjects eligible to be re-randomized were 
≥PASI-50 responders. In the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase, 62 subjects were re-randomized 
to placebo (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo) and 61 subjects were re randomized to APR 30 BID (APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID) at Week 32.

For the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, 
respectively, 35/62 subjects (56.5%) and 7/61 subjects (11.5%) lost 50% of their Week 32 PASI 
improvement at some time point during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. The number of 
censored subjects (those subjects where time to loss of 50% of their PASI improvement could not be 
determined or who did not lose 50% of their PASI improvement prior to Week 52) was 27 (43.5%) and 54 
(88.5%) in the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment 
groups, respectively 
The median time to a loss of 50% of the improvement in PASI score obtained at Week 32 compared to 
baseline was 12.4 and 21.9 weeks following the Week 32 re-randomization for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, respectively (nominal p < 
0.0001).

Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52) in Study PSOR-009 
Response Outcomes in Study PSOR-008 
Of the subjects who lost their PASI-75 response, the magnitude of loss was greater for those on placebo 
compared with those on APR 30 mg BID. Of the subjects who lost their PASI-75 response while remaining 
on APR 30 mg BID treatment, almost 60% were just below PASI-75 (PASI 70 to 74) when response was 
lost, and 90% were still above PASI-60.  Of the 63 subjects who were re randomized to placebo and lost 
their PASI-75 response, approximately 30% were just below PASI-75 (PASI 70 to 74) when the response 
was lost, and approximately 70% were above PASI-60. 
Response Outcomes in Study PSOR-009 
Fewer subjects (11.5%) re-randomized to APR 30 BID lost 50% of the PASI improvement obtained at 
Week 32 compared with those re randomized to placebo (56.5%). Of the subjects who lost response, the 
magnitude of loss was greater for those on placebo compared with those on APR 30 BID. Of the 7 subjects 
who lost response while remaining on APR 30 mg BID treatment, 57.1% (4/7) were below PASI-30 at the 
time of loss of response. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 137/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Of the 35 subjects who were re-randomized to placebo and lost their response, 62.9% (22/35) were 
below PASI-30 when the response was lost. A total of 61 subjects with a PASI-50 response at Week 32 
were re-randomized to continue receiving APR 30 BID through Week 52, of whom, 36 subjects (59.0%) 
were PASI-75 responders and 25 (41.0%) were PASI 50 to 74 responders. At Week 52, 30 of the 61 
subjects (49.2%) were PASI-75 responders and 19 (31.1%) were PASI 50 to 74 responders. 
Among subjects who had been PASI-75 responders at Week 32, 31 were re-randomized to placebo and 36 
were re-randomized to APR 30 BID. Of the re-randomized subjects, 28/31 (90.3%) in the APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and 17/36 (47.2%) in the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups 
lost their PASI-75 response in the Randomized Withdrawal Treatment Phase. 
For the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, 
median time to first loss of PASI-75 was 4.3 weeks and 20.9 weeks from the Week 32 re randomization, 
respectively (nominal p < 0.0001).  
Retreatment Following Relapse in Study PSOR-008 
Once subjects re-randomized to placebo demonstrated a loss of PASI-75 response, they resumed 
treatment with APR 30 BID. This resumption of treatment with APR 30 BID occurred no later than Week 
52. 
A total of 64 of the 77 subjects re-randomized to placebo resumed treatment with APR 30 BID following 
loss of PASI-75 response prior to Week 52. These 64 subjects were retreated with APR 30 BID for a mean 
duration of 13.8 weeks. 
Of these 64 retreated subjects, 70.3% achieved PASI-75 after retreatment during Weeks 32 to 52, with 
51.6% of subjects regaining PASI-75 response within 4 weeks after retreatment. 
Retreatment Following Relapse in Study PSOR-009 
For subjects originally randomized to APR 30 mg BID at baseline (Week 0), PASI-50 responders were 
randomly assigned 1:1 to maintain dosing on APR 30 mg BID or to placebo (treatment withdrawal) at 
Week 32. Once subjects lost 50% improvement in PASI score obtained at Week 32 compared to baseline, 
they resumed treatment with APR 30 mg BID. This resumption of treatment with APR 30 BID occurred 
after Week 32 and prior to Week 52. 
A total of 32 subjects re-randomized to placebo lost 50% of the PASI improvement at Week 32 compared 
to baseline and resumed treatment with APR 30 mg BID during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal 
Phase. These 32 subjects were retreated with APR 30 BID for a mean duration of 11.4 weeks. Of these 32 
retreated subjects, 65.6% achieved PASI-50 after retreatment at some time point, with 34.4%, 51.7%, 
and 53.3% of subjects achieving PASI-50 after 4, 8, and 16 weeks of retreatment, respectively. 
Static Physician Global Assessment 
Of the subjects rerandomized to APR 30 mg BID, 75.3% of the subjects in Study PSOR-008 and 41.0% of 
subjects in Study PSOR-009 had an sPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 32. At Week 52, 
51.9% of the subjects in Study PSOR-008 and 36.1% of subjects in Study PSOR-009 had an sPGA score 
of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). 
Body Surface Area Involvement 
In Study PSOR-008, all treatment groups (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID, APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo/APR 30 BID) had similar mean percent decreases in 
BSA involvement from baseline (≥ 80%) at Week 52. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 138/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In contrast, in Study PSOR-009, the mean percent decrease in BSA involvement from baseline was 
approximately 80% for those subjects re-randomized to APR 30 mg BID but was approximately 64% to 
66% for those subjects re-randomized to placebo. The differences observed between treatment groups 
may be reflective of the protocol-specified population for re-randomization as well as definitions for loss 
of response. In Study PSOR-008, re-randomized subjects were those who were PASI-75 responders at 
Week 32, whereas in Study PSOR-009 it was the PASI-50 responders at Week 32 who were re 
randomized. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index 
Subjects re-randomized to APR 30 mg BID experienced clinically meaningful improvements (mean and 
median decreases) in DLQI Total Score from baseline of at least -7.5 at Week 52 in both studies. In Study 
PSOR-008, 77% of subjects re randomized to APR 30 mg BID at Week 32 had clinically meaningful 
improvement in DLQI (≥5-point decrease in DLQI; and composite endpoint of ≥5-point decrease in DLQI 
and PASI-50 response) at Week 52.  In Study PSOR-009, 70.0% had a ≥5-point decrease in DLQI Total 
Score from baseline, and 62.0% achieved the composite endpoint of ≥5-point decrease in DLQI Total 
Score from baseline and a PASI-50 response at Week 52. 
Visual Analog Scales 
During the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52) in both studies, subjects who 
remained on APR 30 mg BID therapy (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID) generally maintained 
improvements in VAS-related endpoints. 
In both studies, the subjects re-randomized to apremilast (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID) generally 
maintained improvements in Skin Discomfort/Pain VAS (>30 mm decrease from baseline) at Week 52. 
Health-related Quality of Life 
In general, improvements in health-related quality of life assessments were sustained by subjects in all 
treatment groups during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52). Subjects 
re-randomized to APR 30 mg BID at Week 32 (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID) achieved a mean 
change (improvement) from baseline in SF-36v2 MCS of 3.87 in Study PSOR-008 and 3.20 in Study 
PSOR-009 at Week 52; both exceeded the MCID of 2.5. 
In both studies, subjects re-randomized to placebo (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID/placebo/APR 30 BID) also achieved improvements in SF-36v2 MCS that exceeded the 
MCID of 2.5 at Week 52. 
Subjects re-randomized to APR 30 mg BID at Week 32 achieved mean change (improvements) from 
baseline in SF-36v2 PCS of 1.3 in Study PSOR-008 and 2.65 in Study PSOR-009 at Week 52. 
For subjects re randomized to placebo at Week 32 in both studies, mean change (improvement) from 
baseline at Week 52 was greater for subjects who remained on placebo treatment up to Week 52 (APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID/placebo) than for those subjects who resumed APR 30 BID treatment prior to Week 52 
(APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo/APR 30 BID). 
Subjects re randomized to APR 30 BID at Week 32 achieved mean change (improvements) from baseline 
in PHQ-8 of -0.7 in Study PSOR-008 and -1.0 in Study PSOR-009 at Week 52. For subjects re randomized 
to placebo at Week 32 in Study PSOR-008, mean change (improvement) from baseline at Week 52 was 
greater for subjects who remained on placebo treatment up to Week 52 (APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/placebo) than for those subjects who resumed APR 30 BID treatment prior to Week 52 (APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID/placebo/APR 30 BID).  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 139/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In Study PSOR-009, the mean changes (improvements) were similar between subjects who remained on 
placebo treatment up to Week 52 (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo) and for subjects who resumed APR 
30 BID treatment prior to Week 52 (APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo/APR 30 BID). 
Nail Assessments 
All nail parameters indicate sustained improvement in subjects treated with APR 30 BID from baseline 
through Week 52. In both studies, subjects rerandomized to APR 30 mg BID at Week 32 had a mean 
change in NAPSI score from baseline of approximately -60% at Week 52. The mean number of involved 
nails in this treatment group decreased by 3.3 and 2.7 in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, respectively, 
ie, these nails were cleared of psoriasis. Approximately 63% of subjects re-randomized to APR 30 BID at 
Week 32 in both studies achieved NAPSI-50 at Week 52. 
Scalp Psoriasis 
In Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, among subjects with moderate or more severe scalp psoriasis at 
baseline who rerandomized to APR 30 BID at Week 32, over 72% and 54%, respectively, achieved ScPGA 
scores of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) at Week 52 and 77.1% and 62.2%, respectively, achieved ScPGA 
scores of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, or mild) at Week 52. 
In Study PSOR-008, among subjects with moderate or more severe scalp psoriasis at baseline who 
rerandomized to placebo and resumed APR 30 mg BID, approximately 52% of subjects had an ScPGA 
score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) at Week 52 and 67.4% had an ScPGA score of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, 
or mild) at Week 52. In Study PSOR-009, among subjects with moderate or more severe scalp psoriasis 
at baseline who rerandomized to placebo and resumed APR 30 BID, 17.5% of subjects had an ScPGA 
score of 0 or 1 at Week 52 and 27.5% had an ScPGA score of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, or mild) at Week 
52. 
Palmoplantar Psoriasis 
In Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, among subjects with a moderate or severe palmoplantar psoriasis 
at baseline who rerandomized to APR 30 mg BID, 87.5% and 100%, respectively, achieved PPPGA scores 
of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 52 and 87.5% and 100%, respectively, achieved PPPGA scores 
of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, almost clear, or mild) at Week 52. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Psoriatic arthritis 
The MAH has undertaken four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical 
studies (PSA002, PSA003,PSA004 PSA-005) and one additional phase 2 study in support of this 
application in patients with active arthritis. None of these studies were conducted with an active 
comparator. While this complies with the CHMP guidance and scientific advice, the CHMP considered that 
it would have been helpful if an active controlled arm had been included. The applicant has provided a 
comparison of the efficacy and safety with historical data for a range of small molecule and large molecule 
DMARDs which gives some indication as to how apremilast might compare with other active treatments. 
The studies did not include endpoints to show the impact of apremilast on progression of structural 
changes however although no radiographic evidence is available in patients with psoriatic arthritis, the 
available nonclinical and clinical data (in patients with RA) do not indicate that any unexpected, 
deleterious effects or MRI evidence of inhibition of structural damage on cartilage, bone, or joints occur 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 140/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
following treatment with apremilast. Consideration should be given to inclusion of radiographic endpoints 
in future studies with apremilast in PsA. The data after stopping therapy (i.e. a randomised withdrawal 
phase) have not been evaluated in this program. The CHMP considered that this would have been useful 
in terms of evaluating the effect of withdrawal of treatment on persistence of effect or the possibility 
treatment holidays.  
The current study design supports second or third line treatment in patients who have previously failed 
treatment or have had an inadequate response with small molecule and biological DMARDS. Initially the 
applicant proposed an indication for use also in patients who have a contraindication to a DMARD therapy. 
The CHMP considered that contraindication to DMARD therapy was not included as a specific inclusion 
criterion and patients were not stratified a priori according to this criterion. To support the proposed 
indication in the ‘contraindication’ subgroup the applicant has identified a subgroup of subjects with a 
‘contraindication’ to a DMARD therapy who have been included in the pivotal apremilast studies PSA-003 
and PSA-004. The applicant also refered to the experience gained in DMARD-naïve (“first line”) patients 
treated with apremilast in the supportive Phase 3 study PSA-005 and argued that as MTX confers little 
clinical benefit in patients with active PsA (Kingsley, 2012 ) they did not employ MTX as an active 
comparator in this study. The recommendations of international scientific societies, such as the Group for 
Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) (Ritchlin2009) or the European 
League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (Gossec2012) propose MTX as a potential first-line DMARD therapy 
in the management of psoriatic arthritis but acknowledge the limited evidence base for this 
recommendation. This strengthens the need for head to head comparator studies with established 
treatments such as MTX and newer agents using standardised criteria outlined in regulatory guidance. 
The CHMP therefore considered that data with an established active comparator for first line treatment of 
psoriatic arthritis patients who are not controlled by NSAIDs is needed. The clinical relevance of this 
poorly defined ‘contraindication ‘subgroup is questionable and the CHMP concluded that the inclusion in 
section 4.1 of an indication for use in patients with a contraindication to DMARD therapy was not 
supported. This was agreed by the MAH and the product information has been udapted accordingly.  
The apremilast indication therefore reads as follows: 
“Otezla, alone or in combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), is indicated for 
the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or 
who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy”. 
The numbers across dose groups receiving physical therapy was considered small (<1%) by CHMP and 
may reflect the lack of access to appropriate multidisciplinary care. However the CHMP agreed that there 
was no impact on the overall clinical outcomes of the PsA pivotal studies. 
 Plaque psoriasis 
The pivotal Phase 3 studies of apremilast for monotherapy use in psoriasis (Studies PSOR-008 and 
PSOR-009) utilised a similar study design. Both studies consisted of 4 treatment phases: a 16-week, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase; a 16-week double-blind maintenance phase; a 
20-week randomized, double-blind treatment withdrawal phase; and a 208-week, open-label long-term 
safety extension phase. Overall study duration was 5 years.   
The applicant enrolled a range of patients treatment naive (to all systemic or phototherapy) and patients 
whom were treatment experienced and had failed a number of treatments. The demographic 
characteristics of subjects, disease history, prior use of psoriasis related therapies and disease activity at 
baseline were similar across studies and were generally well balanced across treatment groups. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 141/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In Study PSOR-008 at Week 32 (Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase), subjects originally 
randomized to APR 30 BID at baseline who had achieved a 75% reduction in the PASI score [PASI-75] 
were re-randomized to either APR 30 BID or placebo to evaluate time to loss of PASI-75 response. 
Subjects who were re-randomized to placebo and lost their PASI-75 response restarted APR 30 BID 
without retitration. In contrast, Study PSOR-009 utilized a different definition of responder and loss of 
effect in the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. In this study at Week 32 (Randomized Treatment 
Withdrawal Phase), subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID at baseline who had achieved a PASI-50 
response were re-randomized to either APR 30 BID or  placebo to evaluate time to loss of 50% of the PASI 
improvement at Week 32 compared to baseline. Subjects who were re-randomized to placebo and lost 
50% of their PASI response at Week 32 restarted APR 30 BID without retitration. 
In the scientific advice provided to the applicant, the CHMP stated that PASI 75 alone was not sufficient as 
a single endpoint and advised to also power for IGA 0-1. Also the CHMP recommended conducting a three 
arm study with an active comparator with a preference to use methotrexate as an active comparator. The 
applicant is currently conducting a comparator trial with etanercept (Study CC-10004-PSOR-010 is phase 
3b study, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-arm study comparing apremilast and etanercept versus 
placebo in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis). The applicant will provide the full study 
report when finalised (as described in the RMP). At the present time, a justification that the efficacy and 
safety data support a broad indication in patients in need of systemic therapy was considered inadequate, 
in particular since an active comparator study with a conventional systemic therapy has not been 
presented for assessment. It is therefore difficult at the present time to put the efficacy and safety of this 
product into context with other systemic therapies. Notwithstanding this, the benefit/risk remains 
positive for marketing authorisation. The applicant also agreed to amend the indication to a second line 
population: “adult patients who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to 
other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA)”. 
This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Psoriatic arthritis 
The key primary endpoint (ACR 20 response rate) was met to a statistical level across the three pivotal 
studies (FAS). This is supported by a range of sensitivity analyses. In the pooled analysis, 32% in the APR 
20 BID treatment group and from 37% in the APR 30 BID treatment group achieved the mACR primary 
endpoint at week 16. In the pooled analysis a treatment effect compared with placebo in favour of 
apremilast 30 BID (mACR primary endpoint 13.2% and 18.3% at week 16 and 13% and 15.8% at week 
24 (p<0.0001)) was demonstrated for APR20 BID and APR30 BID groups respectively. The duration of 
effect after the primary endpoint of 16 weeks was evaluated in a placebo controlled manner at week 24. 
From the available data at week 24 (FAS NRI) and from week 24-50 (APR analyses using OC and NRI) a 
treatment effect in favour of  apremilast is apparent from 16 to 24 weeks and is maintained up to 52 
weeks. At Week 52 across the three pivotal studies in patients initially randomised to APR (NRI), the 
modified ACR 20 response rates observed in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups were 
generally comparable (Pooled analysis APR20 BID 40.8%; APR30BD 42.1%). This data suggests that 
efficacy is maintained through week 52.  
In terms of a dose effect, the modified ACR 20 response rates observed in the pooled data for APR 20 BID 
and APR 30 BID treatment showed a treatment effect in favour of APR30 BID at week 16. During the 
24-52 week treatment period efficacy levels are generally maintained. The applicant proposed a standard 
starting dose of 10 mg titrated up to 30 mg over one week. Although the Phase III data does not clearly 
distinguish between the 20 mg BID and 30 mg BID dose, overall the weight of evidence from the primary 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 142/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and secondary endpoints is in favour of the 30 mg BID dose as the proposed treatment dose. This was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
Current CHMP guidelines recommend that axial involvement should be assessed as an important 
secondary endpoint. BASDAI was evaluated as an exploratory analysis. The study population enrolled in 
the apremilast PsA Phase 3 program included subjects with the following clinical subtypes of PsA: 
symmetric polyarthritis (62.0%), asymmetric oligoarthritis (26.9%), distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint 
predominant (6.2%), arthritis mutilans (2.7%) and spondylitis predominant (2.1%). Axial involvement, a 
common secondary feature of peripheral predominant PsA disease, was present in 37% (548/1493) of 
subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 program. A further review of efficacy data in the subpopulation of PSA 
patients who have axial involvement secondary to peripheral join involvement was provided by the 
applicant. The prevalence of axial involvement reported in the literature varies due to the lack of an 
accepted definition of spinal involvement in axial arthritis PsA. According to several reports, spinal 
involvement in patients with PsA ranges from 25% to 70% of cases. The relative proportion of axial 
involvement in the apremilast phase 3 study population falls within this range (37% (548/1493) of 
subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 program). The efficacy of apremilast 30 mg twice daily has been 
demonstrated in the sub-population of subjects with axial disease Baseline BASDAI Score ≥4 (pooled 
data at week 16 and 24 mean difference with placebo -0.57 p=0.0173 and -0.85 p=0.007 respectively), 
thereby supporting some level of efficacy in this subgroup with axial involvement as a secondary feature 
of peripheral predominant PsA disease. In the predominant spondylitis subgroup 3/12 (25%) of APR30mg 
BID vs 2/7 (28.6%) placebo had a treatment effect in favour of placebo. The numbers of subjects with 
predominant spondylitis make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from these data. The CHMP 
considered that it is unnecessary to restrict the indication by specifically excluding patients with axial 
disease as this could result in patients who could benefit from treatment being denied treatment. 
Clinically relevant information from subgroup or post-hoc analyses in patients with predominately 
spondylitic disease and in patients with axial involvement as a secondary feature of peripheral 
predominant PsA disease, reflecting the limited robustness of  these observations is included in the 
product information as requested by the CHMP. 
Mean change in HAQ-DI from baseline in the APR 30 BID treatment group in all three studies at Weeks 16 
was -0.2. The treatment effect in terms of difference with placebo was -0.14 in APR30mg BID pooled 
analysis. This mean change from baseline for APR30 BID achieved statistical significance with placebo at 
week 16 and 24. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in HAQ-DI reflecting a meaningful 
improvement in physical function has not been clearly described for patients with PsA. However minimum 
clinically important difference (MCID) values were identified in the published literature available at the 
time of the protocol development and study conduct (change from baseline of -0.3[Mease, 2004a] and 
-0.35 [Mease 2011b] and a further estimate, change from baseline of -0.13 [Kwok, 2010]). When group 
median (and mean) changes well exceed the MCID, it can be expected that a majority of patients will 
attain clinically meaningful improvement. The mean improvements from baseline (pooled analysis) 
exceeded a MCID ≥ 0.13 however did not exceed a MCID of >0.3.At week 16, a range of 33.5% to 38% 
in the APR30mg BID group across all three studies had achieved ≥0.3-unit improvement in the HAQ-DI. 
The treatment effect in terms of difference with placebo ranged from 5.1% to 5.9% in the APR 20mg BID 
group and 6.9% to 13.2% in APR30mg BID across the three studies (nom.sig in studies PSA-002 and 
PSA003 for 30mg BID group).  
The CHMP concluded that apremilast has been shown to improve physical function. The MCID for HAQ-DI 
in psoriatic arthritis has not been clearly established. The statement: “Otezla has been shown to improve 
physical function” has therefore been removed from the indication by the applicant.

Plaque psoriasis 
The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of subjects treated with either APR 30 BID or 
placebo who achieved a PASI-75 response at Week 16 compared to baseline. In both studies, a 
statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group achieved the 
primary endpoint, compared with placebo (p <0.0001 for both studies), as evaluated using the primary 
analysis method (i.e. missing values at Week 16 imputed using LOCF). The results for the primary 
endpoint (PASI 75) and key secondary endpoint (sPGA) were supported by the sensitivity analyses 
conducted to assess the impact of missing data. All these sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar 
results and statistically significant differences between the APR 30 BID treatment group compared with 
placebo treatment group (p <0.0001 for all sensitivity analyses). 
The major secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects treated with either APR 30 BID or placebo 
with an sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 
16 (Feldman, 2005). The applicant also examined additional endpoints such as Scalp Physician Global 
Assessment (ScPGA), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Patient Health Questionnaire depression 
scale (PHQ-8), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Palmoplantar Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment 
(PPPGA) and Short Form 36-item Health Survey ect. 
In both studies, a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment 
group achieved sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear), with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline 
at Week 16 compared with placebo (p < 0.0001). The response rates in the placebo and APR 30 BID 
treatment groups were 3.9% and 21.7%, respectively, in Study PSOR-008, and were 4.4% and 20.4%, 
respectively, in Study PSOR-009. 
The composite endpoint was defined as the number of subjects who achieved both a PASI-75 and sPGA 
scores of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16. In both 
pivotal studies, a nominally significantly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group 
achieved the composite endpoint at Week 16 compared with placebo (nominal p <0.0001). Similar 
findings were observed in the PP population. PSOR 008  and PSOR 009  showed a 16.7 %  and 14.2% 
greater response rate response in favour of APR 30 MG BID at 16 weeks. 
The mean DLQI Total Scores at baseline were approximately 12.5 in both pivotal studies, indicating a 
significant impact of psoriasis on the subjects’ quality of life. In both studies, subjects treated with APR 30 
BID achieved statistically significant improvement (reduction) in the DLQI Total Score at Week 16 
compared with placebo (p <0.0001). 
The mean changes from baseline were -2.1 and -6.6 for subjects treated with placebo or APR 30 BID, 
respectively, in Study PSOR-008 and were -2.8 and -6.7, respectively, in Study PSOR-009. The mean 
improvement at Week 16 for the APR 30 BID treatment group of 6.6 in Study PSOR-008, and 6.7 in Study 
PSOR-009, exceeded the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of at least a 5-point decrease 
from baseline (Finlay, 1994; NICE, 2012). 
Overall, 558 of the 844 subjects (66%) enrolled in Study PSOR-008 and 266 of the 411 subjects (64.7%) 
enrolled in Study PSOR-009 had nail psoriasis at baseline. The percent mean change from baseline at 
Week 16 for placebo-treated subjects was 6.5% and -7.1% in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, 
respectively, and for apremilast-treated subjects was -22.5% and -29.0% in Studies PSOR-008 and 
PSOR-009, respectively. Although a positive response to treatment is seen, it is not known why the 
placebo groups appear to opposite to each other in the two studies. 
The proportion of subjects with an ScPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) were 17.5% and 46.5% for 
placebo and APR 30 BID treatment groups, respectively, in Study PSOR-008 and were 17.2% and 40.9%, 
respectively in Study PSOR-009, both results were statistically significant better in favour of treatment.

For both studies, the PASI-75 response rates for subjects originally randomised to APR 30 BID were 
generally maintained through Week 32. Subjects originally randomized to placebo demonstrated a 
response to apremilast treatment, similar to that seen for subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID 
at baseline. By Week 24, the PASI response rates for subjects who were originally randomized to placebo 
following 8 weeks of APR 30 BID treatment were generally comparable to those for subjects receiving 24 
weeks of APR 30 BID. 
The sPGA response rates for subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID peaked around Week 16 in 
both studies and were generally maintained through Week 32. Subjects originally randomized to placebo 
demonstrated rapid sPGA response following initiation of apremilast treatment, similar to that seen for 
subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID at baseline. By Week 24, the response rates for subjects 
originally randomized to placebo following 8 weeks of APR 30 BID treatment were similar to those for 
subjects who received 24 weeks of APR 30 BID. 
At Week 32, after placebo subjects had been treated with APR 30 BID for 16 weeks, reductions in BSA 
involvement were similar between the treatment groups, and greater than the changes at Week 16. The 
mean percent changes (improvement) from baseline in BSA involvement for the placebo/APR 30 BID and 
APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups were -59.25% and -61.18%, respectively, in Study PSOR-008 
and -58.73% and -60.67%, respectively, in Study PSOR-009. 
At Weeks 24 and 32 in both studies, subjects originally randomized to placebo achieved similar changes 
in DLQI Total Scores from baseline as did those subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID and were 
greater than the changes observed at Week 16. Patients continuing treatment on APR 30 mg BID had 
similar change form baseline responses at 24 and 32 weeks and similarity in DLQI changes were seen 
between both studies. However in the proportion of patients with at least a 5 point change in DLQI is 
slightly lower for patients continuing on treatment at 24 weeks versus 32 weeks. 
The longer duration of treatment with APR 30mg BID was associated with better NASPSI score, however 
the difference seen in NAPSI score change for patients initially on placebo and then switched to APR 30mg 
bid is different between the two studies (PSOR 008 at week 32 mean -24.6 compared with -47.6 in OO9 
study- although it is recognised there is large variability). Approximately half of patients enrolled also had 
scalp psoriasis, of the subjects with ScPGA score ≥3 (moderate or greater) at baseline, the proportion of 
subjects who achieved an improvement of ScPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) was numerically 
greater for the placebo/APR 30 BID group than for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID group at Weeks 24 and 32. 
Again in patients maintaining therapy throughout there appears to be a lower effect at 32 weeks 
compared with 24 weeks treatment, and about 10 % higher in patients who were initially treated with 
placebo. 
Palmoplantar Psoriasis Analyses During the Maintenance Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) in Studies PSOR-008 
and PSOR-009 (FAS With Baseline PPPGA ≥3) the patient numbers are too low to draw any meaningful 
conclusions on palmoplantar psoriasis, however improvement is seen with treatment versus placebo and 
it appears to be maintained over time. 
Subjects who were re-randomized were those subjects originally randomized to APR 30 BID and achieved 
a PASI-75 response (Study PSOR-008) or at least a PASI-50 response (Study PSOR-009) at Week 32, 
were re-randomized to either APR 30 BID or placebo in order to evaluate time to first loss of effect. 
Of the re-randomized subjects in PSOR 008 the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/APR 30 BID treatment group, 63/77 subjects (81.8%) and 40/77 subjects (51.9%), respectively, lost 
PASI-75 response at some time point during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. The median 
time to first loss of PASI-75 was 5.1 weeks and 17.7 weeks from the Week 32 re-randomization, 
respectively (nominal p <0.0001). 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 145/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In contrast to PSOR-008, the time to first loss of effect in Study PSOR-009 was defined as loss of 50% of 
the improvement in PASI score obtained at Week 32 compared to baseline after re randomization in the 
Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. 
For the APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, 
respectively, 35/62 subjects (56.5%) and 7/61 subjects (11.5%) lost 50% of their Week 32 PASI 
improvement at some time point during the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. 
The median time to a loss of 50% of the improvement in PASI score obtained at Week 32 compared to 
baseline was 12.4 and 21.9 weeks following the Week 32 re-randomization for the APR 30 BID/APR 30 
BID/placebo and APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID/APR 30 BID treatment groups, respectively (nominal p 
<0.0001). 
While patients randomised to continued treatment have a longer duration of response and a higher 
percentage of patients maintaining either PASI 75 or PASI 50, a considerable number of patients lose 
PASI 75 with continued treatment (PSOR 008 – 51.9%) although the patient numbers are low and 57.5% 
have PASI scores of 70-74,  it is unclear why this occurs. However longer term efficacy data is awaited 
from the ongoing studies 008 and 009 (as described in the RMP). 
Of the subjects re-randomized to APR 30 BID, 75.3% of the subjects in Study PSOR-008 and 41.0% of 
subjects in Study PSOR-009 had an sPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 32. At Week 52, 
51.9% of the subjects in Study PSOR-008 and 36.1% of subjects in Study PSOR-009 had an sPGA score 
of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). Both studies also showed that patients continuing on treatment had a 
longer time to loss of s PGA approximately 20 weeks compared with placebo 4-5 weeks. Similar to the 
PASI loss with continued treatment approximately 40% of patient on continued treatment fail to maintain 
s PGA of 0-1 32 weeks to 52 weeks.   
Subjects re-randomized to APR 30 BID experienced clinically meaningful improvements (mean and 
median decreases) in DLQI Total Score from baseline of at least -7.5 at Week 52 in both studies. In Study 
PSOR-008, 77% of subjects re-randomized to APR 30 BID at Week 32 had clinically meaningful 
improvement in DLQI (≥ 5-point decrease in DLQI; and composite endpoint of ≥ 5-point decrease in DLQI 
and PASI-50 response) at Week 52. In Study PSOR-009, 70.0% had a ≥5-point decrease in DLQI Total 
Score from baseline, and 62.0% achieved the composite endpoint of ≥5-point decrease in DLQI Total 
Score from baseline and a PASI-50 response at Week 52. Patients whom were randomised to placebo at 
32 weeks and were re-treated with APR 30 mg BID generally had the same scores as patients continuing 
on treatment until 52 weeks, however similar to the PASI and sPGA scores it appears that patients on 
active treatment have better results at 32 weeks compared with 52 weeks. Longer term efficacy data is 
awaited from the ongoing studies 008 and 009 (as described in the RMP). 
All nail parameters indicate sustained improvement in subjects treated with APR 30 BID from baseline 
through Week 52. In both studies, subjects re-randomized to APR 30 BID at Week 32 had a mean change 
in NAPSI score from baseline of approximately -60% at Week 52. The mean number of involved nails in 
this treatment group decreased by 3.3 and 2.7 in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, respectively, i.e., 
these nails were cleared of psoriasis. Approximately 63% of subjects rerandomized to APR 30 BID at 
Week 32 in both studies achieved NAPSI-50 at Week 52. 
In Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, among subjects with moderate or more severe scalp psoriasis at 
baseline who rerandomized to APR 30 BID at Week 32, over 72% and 54%, respectively, achieved ScPGA 
scores of 0 or 1 (clear or minimal) at Week 52 and 77.1% and 62.2%, respectively, achieved ScPGA 
scores of 0, 1, or 2 (clear, minimal, or mild) at Week 52. Patients on APR 30 mg BID whether continuous 
or retreated have better ScPGA scores than patients on placebo at 52 weeks, patients on continuous 
treatment have better results compared with patients who are retreated following randomisation to 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014

placebo. Although patient numbers are low the ScPGA scores of 0-1 are higher at week 32 compared with 
week 52 for patients continuing on treatment. 
In Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009, among subjects with a moderate or severe palmoplantar psoriasis 
at baseline who rerandomized to APR 30 BID, 87.5% and 100%, respectively, achieved PPPGA scores of 
0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 52 and 87.5% and 100%, respectively, achieved PPPGA scores of 
0, 1, or 2 (clear, almost clear, or mild) at Week 52. The studies showed efficacy in patients with 
palmoplantar psoriasis with continued treatment to 52 weeks, however patient numbers are too low to 
draw meaningful conclusions. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Psoriatic Arthritis 
A treatment effect in favour of apremilast (mACR primary endpoint 18.3% at week 16 and 15.8% at week 
24 p<0.0001) was demonstrated for APR30mg BID across the three studies in patients who have 
previously failed or have not responded to prior DMARD therapy in terms of treatment of symptoms and 
clinical indices of articular disease activity both for those on DMARDs (small molecule and biological) and 
for those not on DMARDs at baseline. 
Improvement in the signs and symptoms of PsA, as measured by the modified ACR 20 response at week 
16, continued up to Week 52 across all three pivotal Phase 3 studies.  
Improvement in physical function was evaluated using HAQ-DI score, SF-36v2 physical functioning 
domain score statistically and nominally significant improvements were seen across both these endpoints 
across all three studies at week 16 and were maintained across week 24 and 52. Improvement in physical 
function evaluated using HAQ-DI was supported by a change from baseline in the average HAQ-DI score 
of -0.2 across all three studies for APR30mg BID The HAQ-DI score was also maintained between Week 
24 and Week 52.  
The results of the ACR20 analysis were supported by the results of the modified PsARC, DAS28[CRP], 
EULAR good/moderate response) analyses. A positive treatment effect was also observed irrespective of 
the number or type of prior small-molecule DMARD or biologic used. 
A consistent, improvement in modified ACR 20 responses, compared to placebo, was observed 
irrespective of whether apremilast was given alone (approximately 35% of subjects) or in combination 
with concomitant small-molecule DMARDs (approximately 65% of subjects). 
Improvements in extra articular manifestations of psoriatic disease (PASI-75, MASES, dactylitis severity 
score), and health-related quality of life (SF-36v2 PCS score, FACIT-Fatigue score) at Weeks 16 and 24, 
and these improvements were broadly maintained at Week 52 with continued apremilast treatment. 
There was no formal comparison of efficacy between the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups 
but in general higher and more consistent responses were observed for subjects receiving APR 30 BID 
over APR 20 BID  up to week 24 (the placebo –controlled period).  
The CHMP concluded that the inclusion in section 4.1 of an indication for use in patients with a 
contraindication to DMARD therapy was not supported. This was agreed by the MAH and the product 
information has been udapted. The apremilast indication therefore reads as follows: 
“Otezla, alone or in combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), is indicated for 
the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or 
who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy”. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 147/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The CHMP also concluded that apremilast has been shown to improve physical function. The MCID for 
HAQ-DI in psoriatic arthritis has not been clearly established. The statement: “Otezla has been shown to 
improve physical function” has therefore been removed from the indication by the applicant. 
Plaque psoriasis 
Efficacy has been demonstrated for patients with plaque psoriasis for induction at 16 weeks and short 
maintenance for an additional 16 weeks. Pooled analysis shows a statistical significant difference in favour 
of Apremilast 30mg bid for PASI 75 at 16 weeks ( 26.2 % improvement) and s PGA (17.2 % 
improvement) versus placebo,  and 15.9% of patients achieving both PASI 75 and sPGA 0-1 at 16 weeks, 
with higher efficacy observed at later time points. 
Continued treatment shows maintenance of effect of PASI and sPGA in weeks 16 to 32, and patients 
continued on treatment having significantly longer time before loss of PASI 75, PASI 50 or s PGA is 
observed at week 32 to 52. 
Also patients who were treated with placebo in the randomised withdrawal phase showed significant 
responses following retreatment with Apremilast 30mg BID. 
As an active comparator study with a conventional systemic therapy such as methotrexate was not 
conducted, it is difficult to rank this product with other first line systemic conventional therapies. An active 
comparator study versus etanercept is being conducted in patients failing conventional systemic therapy. 
The applicant will provide the full study report when finalised (as described in the RMP). At the present 
time, a justification that the efficacy and safety data support a broad indication in patients in need of 
systemic therapy was considered inadequate, in particular since an active comparator study with a 
conventional systemic therapy has not been presented for assessment. It is therefore difficult at the 
present time to put the efficacy and safety of this product into context with other systemic therapies. 
Notwithstanding this, the benefit/risk remains positive for marketing authorisation. The applicant 
therefore agreed to amend the indication to a second line population: “adult patients who failed to 
respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including 
cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA)”. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The overall safety evaluation plan assessed the safety data obtained from a total of 30 clinical studies of 
apremilast, including 16 clinical pharmacology studies and 14 Phase 2/ 3 studies in various indications. Of 
the 16 clinical pharmacology studies conducted with apremilast, 13 were in healthy subjects (N=422) and 
3 were in non healthy subjects (N=39). The non healthy subjects comprised 15 subjects with PsA or RA, 
8 subjects with severe renal impairment, and 16 subjects with hepatic impairment. The 14 Phase 2/ 3 
studies included primary and supporting clinical studies as follows: 6 in psoriasis, 5 in PsA, 1 in RA, 1 in 
Behçet’s disease, and 1 in asthma. In these studies, the following apremilast dosage regimens were 
evaluated: 10 mg twice daily (APR 10 BID), 20 mg once daily (APR 20 QD), 20 mg BID (APR 20 BID), 40 
mg QD (APR 40 QD), and 30 mg BID (APR 30 BID). The Phase 2/3 studies in PsA and psoriasis (except 
PSOR-001, PSOR-004) had a placebo controlled treatment phase. Studies PSOR-005-E-LTE, PSOR-008, 
PSOR-009, PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA-004, and PSA-005 also have open-label, active-treatment, long-term 
extension phases. The planned duration of the placebo-controlled phases in these studies ranged from 12 
to 24 weeks.

Patient exposure 
Apremilast Data Pool 
A summary of total exposure to apremilast in the Apremilast Data Pool, which includes subjects initially 
randomized to apremilast as well as placebo subjects who switched to apremilast, is presented in Table 
59. A total of 4089 subjects received at least one dose of apremilast. In the Apremilast Data Pool, 3049 
(74.6%) subjects received apremilast (APR Total groups) for at least 24 weeks, including 1024 (70.6%) 
subjects who received APR 20 BID and 1930 (81.9%) subjects who received APR 30 BID. A total of 1631 
(39.9%) subjects had been exposed to apremilast (APR Total group) for at least 52 weeks in completed 
and ongoing studies, including 510 (35.2%) subjects in the APR 20 BID group and 1107 (47.0%) subjects 
in the APR 30 BID group, as of the cut-off dates for the submission, i.e., 01 Mar 2013 for ongoing PsA 
studies (Studies PSA-002, PSA-003, PSA-004, PSA-005) and 11 Jan 2013 for ongoing psoriasis studies 
(PSOR-008, PSOR-009, and PSOR-005-E-LTE).

Treated) 
Demographics 
The demographic characteristics of subjects at baseline in the Apremilast Data Pool were generally well 
balanced  across  treatment  groups  (Table  60).  The  majority  of  subjects  were  white  (93.5%)  and  not 
Hispanic (88.0%), and 54.3% were male. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 85 years; the overall median 
age was 49.0 years. Subjects’ median weight was 85.00 kg and subjects’ median BMI was 29.30 kg/m2. 
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  enrolled  in  North  America  (50.9%),  35.9%  were  enrolled  in 
Europe, and 13.2% were enrolled in the Rest of the World.

Medical History 
PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
The reported medical history of subjects in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool was consistent with the disease 
population and known comorbidities and was generally well balanced across treatment groups. Overall, 
91.4% of subjects reported at least one medical history condition. A substantial percentage of the subject 
population had a history of cardiovascular conditions. Individual cardiovascular risk factors included 
hypertension (38.2%), hypercholesterolemia (13.7%), obesity (11.0%), hyperlipidemia (8.4%) and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (6.6%). Another known comorbidity of psoriatic arthritis is depression, which was

gastroesophageal reflux disease (11.0%), osteoarthritis (10.8%) and drug hypersensitivity (10.1%). All 
other medical history conditions were reported in <10% of subjects in the Apremilast Data Pool. 
Concomitant Medications  
PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
The majority of subjects in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool took concomitant medications during the 
Placebo-controlled Period (96.0%, placebo group; 97.1%, APR Total group). 
With the exception of PSA-005, where apremilast was evaluated as monotherapy, subjects were allowed 
to continue use of stable baseline doses of small-molecule DMARDs, oral corticosteroids, and/or 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) concomitantly per protocol. The percentage of subjects 
receiving concomitant therapy was generally consistent across treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported concomitant medications were anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic 
products (67.1%, placebo group; 69.6%, APR Total group), antipsoriatics (44.7%, placebo group; 43.5%, 
APR Total group), all other therapeutic products (39.3%, placebo group; 39.5%, APR Total group), drugs 
for acid related disorders (27.6%, placebo group; 32.3%, APR Total group), analgesics (25.9%, placebo 
group; 30.9%, APR Total group), and lipid modifying agents (21.9%, placebo group; 20.5%, APR Total 
group). All other classes of concomitant medications were used by <20% of subjects in the placebo or 
APR total groups. Similar patterns of concomitant medication use were observed for Apremilast Subjects 
as Treated during the Apremilast-exposure Period in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool. 
PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
The majority of subjects in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool took concomitant medications during the 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 (82.1%, placebo group; 84.5%, APR 30 BID group). The most 
frequently reported concomitant medications were analgesics (Placebo, 25.8%; APR 30 BID, 29.3%) and 
anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (Placebo, 23.4%; APR 30 BID, 29.8%). Similar patterns of 
concomitant medication use were observed for Apremilast Subjects as Treated during the 
Apremilast-exposure Period in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool. 
Apremilast Data Pool 
The majority of subjects in the Apremilast Data Pool, for Subjects as Initially Treated at Week 0, took 
concomitant medications (88.7%, placebo group; 90.4%, APR Total group). 
The percentage of subjects receiving concomitant therapy was generally consistent across treatment 
groups. The most frequently reported concomitant medications were anti-inflammatory and 
antirheumatic products (50.8%, placebo group; 53.1%, APR Total group), analgesics (27.1%, placebo 
group; 31.0%, APR Total group), drugs for acid related disorders (22.5, placebo group; 25.1%, APR Total 
group), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (25.7%, placebo group; 24.5%, APR Total group), 
all other therapeutic products (24.9%, placebo group; 24.3%, APR Total group), antipsoriatics (23.6%, 
placebo group; 21.7%, APR Total group), and lipid modifying agents (20.1%, placebo group; 19.6%, APR 
Total group). All other classes of concomitant medications were used by < 20% of subjects in either the 
placebo or APR total groups. 
Similar patterns of concomitant medication use were observed in Apremilast Subjects as Treated during 
the Apremilast Data Pool for the Apremilast-exposure Period.

PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
- Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
An overview of TEAEs during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
is presented in Table 64. The subject incidence of at least one TEAE or TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal 
was higher in subjects treated with apremilast than subjects receiving placebo, with a trend suggesting a 
dose effect. The percentage of subjects with severe or serious TEAEs was low and there was no clinically 
meaningful difference between subjects treated with placebo or apremilast or between subjects treated 
with APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID. 
Table 64: PsA Phase 3 Data Pool: Overview of TEAEs During the Treatment Duration Period 
Weeks 0 to 16 
- Apremilast-exposure Period 
During the Apremilast-exposure Period for the Apremilast Subjects as Treated population, the EAIR per 
100 subject-years for TEAEs was 166.0 in the APR Total group; 158.6 in the APR 20 BID group and 174.0 
in the APR 30 BID group. During the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 for the Subjects as Treated 
population, EAIRs per 100 subject-years for TEAEs was 280.5 in the APR Total group; 254.6 in the APR 20 
BID group and 309.1 in the APR 30 BID group. The EAIR per 100 subject-years did not increase during the 
Apremilast exposure Period; therefore, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of TEAEs with 
longer apremilast exposure. Similarly, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of severe TEAEs, 
serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal, based on EAIR per 100 subject years. 
PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
An overview of TEAEs during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
is presented in Table 65. The subject incidence of at least one TEAE or TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal 
was higher in subjects treated with APR 30 BID compared with placebo. The percentage of subjects with 
severe or serious TEAEs was low and there was no clinically meaningful difference between subjects 
treated with placebo or APR 30 BID. The findings were similar for both the Subjects as Initially Treated at 
Week 0 and Subjects as Treated populations.

During the Apremilast-exposure Period for the Apremilast Subjects as Treated population, the EAIR per 
100 subject-years for TEAEs was 287.4 in the APR 30 BID group. During the Treatment Duration Period 
Weeks 0 to 16 for the Subjects as Treated population, EAIRs per 100 subject years for TEAEs was 483.8 
in the APR 30 BID group.Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years, there was no evidence of an increased 
incidence of TEAEs with longer apremilast exposure. Similarly, there was no evidence of an increased 
incidence of severe TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal, based on EAIR per 100 
subject-years. 
Apremilast Data Pool 
Placebo-controlled Period 
An overview of TEAEs during the Placebo-controlled Period for the Apremilast Data Pool is presented in 
Table 66. At least one TEAE was reported by 53.6% of subjects in the placebo group and 65.2% of 
subjects in the APR Total group. The subject incidence of at least one TEAE or TEAEs leading to drug 
withdrawal was higher in the APR Total group than the placebo group, with no clinically meaningful 
difference between subjects treated with APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID. The percentage of subjects with 
severe or serious TEAEs was low and there was no clinically meaningful difference between subjects 
treated with placebo or apremilast or between subjects treated with APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID.

An overview of TEAEs during the Apremilast-exposure Period for the Apremilast Data Pool is presented in 
Table 67. With the additional subject exposure to apremilast, there was no evidence of an increased 
incidence of TEAEs, severe TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal, based on EAIR per 
100 subject-years. 
Table 67: Apremilast Data Pool: Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events During the 
Apremilast-exposure Period (Apremilast Subjects as Treated) 
Common Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs during the Placebo-controlled Period were gastrointestinal disorders 
(diarrhoea, nausea), infections and infestations (URTIs, nasopharyngitis) and nervous system disorders 
(headache, tension headache). 
A treatment and dose effect was observed for gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders, 
but not for infections and infestations. 
The pattern of TEAEs was similar in the PsA and PSOR Phase 3 studies. The EAIRs per 100 subject-years 
for each of the 6 frequently reported TEAEs in apremilast-treated subjects did not increase during the 
Apremilast-exposure Period; therefore, there is no evidence that the incidence of these events increases 
with longer apremilast exposure. 
PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
In the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool, the SOCs with the highest subject incidence of TEAEs during the Treatment 
Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations and nervous 
system disorders. The proportions of subjects reporting TEAEs in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders 
and nervous system disorders were higher in the apremilast groups than the placebo group, with a trend 
suggesting a dose effect. 
There was no notable difference between the placebo and apremilast groups in the percentage of subjects 
reporting TEAEs in the SOC of infections and infestations and there was no evidence of a dose effect. 
Investigations and cardiac disorders were also reported in a higher percentage of subjects in the 
apremilast groups than the placebo group.  
A summary of TEAEs with subject incidence of at least 2% in any treatment group during the Treatment 
Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool is presented in Table 68. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs were diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection, which is 
consistent with the most frequently, reported SOCs listed above. These TEAEs were reported at a higher 
frequency in the APR Total group than the placebo group. The subject incidence of diarrhoea, nausea, and 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 156/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
headache was higher in the APR 30 BID group than in the APR 20 BID group, suggesting a dose effect. A 
dose effect was not observed for upper respiratory tract infection. 
Table 68: PsA Phase 3 Data Pool: TEAEs with Subject Incidence of at Least 2% in any 
Treatment Group During the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
- Apremilast-exposure Period 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool during the Apremilast-exposure Period 
were the same as those reported during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, ie, diarrhea, 
nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. During the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 
to 16 the EAIRs per 100 subject-years for the frequently reported TEAEs in the APR treatment groups 
were higher than those during the Apremilast-exposure Period. Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years, 
there is no evidence of an increased incidence of frequently reported TEAEs with longer exposure to 
apremilast. 
PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
In the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool, the system organ classes (SOCs) with the highest subject incidence of 
TEAEs during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and 
infestations, and nervous system disorders. The proportions of subjects reporting a TEAE in the SOCs of 
gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders were higher in the APR 30 BID group than in the 
placebo group. The percentage of subjects reporting infections and infestations was similar in the APR 30 
BID and the placebo groups. 
A summary of TEAEs with subject incidence of at least 2% in any treatment group during the Treatment 
Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool is presented in Table 69. The most 
frequently reported TEAEs were diarrhoea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, 
tension headache, and headache, which is consistent with the most frequently reported SOCs listed above. 
The subject incidence of diarrhoea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, tension headache, and 
headache was higher in the APR 30 BID group than in the placebo group.

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool during the Apremilast-exposure 
Period were the same as those reported during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, i.e., 
diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, nasopharyngitis, tension headache, and headache. 
During the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 the EAIRs per 100 subject-years for the frequently 
reported TEAEs in the APR 30 BID group were higher than those during the Apremilast-exposure Period. 
Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years, there is no evidence of an increased incidence of the frequently 
reported TEAEs with longer exposure to apremilast. 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
Placebo-controlled Period 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were diarrhoea, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, 
and nasopharyngitis. Of these, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infections 
occurred more frequently in the APR Total group than the placebo group, and a dose effect was observed 
for diarrhoea, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. Other frequently reported GI TEAEs also 
showed treatment effects (e.g., vomiting, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain). 
Tension headache also occurred more frequently in the APR Total group than the placebo group. 
- Apremilast-exposure Period 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the Apremilast Data Pool during the Apremilast-exposure Period 
were the same as those reported during the Placebo-controlled Period. Based on EAIR per 100

Deaths 
As of 31 July 2013, 8 subjects have died during the apremilast clinical program (3 in placebo, 1 in APR 20 
BID, and 4 in APR 30 BID). Of these, 7 deaths occurred in applicant’s sponsored studies, including 1 death 
in a PsA study and 6 deaths in psoriasis studies. In addition, 1 death occurred in an investigator-initiated 
study in RA. There is no pattern associated with cause of death in the apremilast clinical program.  
PsA Studies 
• 
In  Study  PSA-002,  a  52-year-old  subject  who  was  randomized  to  the  APR  20  BID  treatment 
group, died due to multi-organ failure on Day 73 of the study. The subject had been diagnosed 
with anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency prior to the first dose of apremilast and was also 
receiving concomitant MTX for the treatment of PsA. 
Psoriasis Studies 
Placebo 
• 
In Study PSOR-009, a 51-year-old subject, died on Study Day 354 due to intracranial 
hemorrhage, 130 days after the last dose of APR 30 BID while in the Randomized Treatment 
Withdrawal Phase. The subject received apremilast for 224 days followed by placebo in the 
Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase. The event occurred on Study Day 353. On Day 352, 
the subject complained of a headache. The subject was found unresponsive on the floor the 
following day. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed a large intracranial hematoma 
in the left hemisphere centered in the basal ganglia region with intraventricular extension and a 
small bilateral subarachnoid component; midline shift by 1.7 cm as well as evidence of left uncal 
and tonsilar herniation; and hematoma that filled the third and fourth ventricles. A neurosurgeon

reviewed the imaging and recommended palliative therapy. The subject was pronounced brain 
dead on Study Day 354. 
• 
• 
In Study PSOR-005-E-LTE, a 63-year-old subject receiving placebo, was found dead with a pink 
complexion on Study Day 84 in the closed garage with a motorcycle running. An autopsy did not 
establish cause of death for this subject. 
In Study PSOR-008, a 28-year-old subject, committed suicide via a gunshot wound. The subject 
was randomized to placebo and had received the last dose on Day 29. The SAE occurred on Study 
Day 55. The subject’s relevant medical history included previous suicide attempts, depression, 
obesity, unstable family life, alcohol abuse, insomnia, and treatment for bipolar disorder. 
Apremilast 
• 
• 
In Study PSOR-004, a 398-pound, 48-year-old subject with psoriasis who was randomized to the 
APR 20 BID group, had a history of cardiac arrhythmia that was treated with a cardiac ablation 
procedure. The subject had an unwitnessed death at histhe subject’s home 140 days after the 
start of apremilast treatment and 53 days after the dose was increased from 20 mg BID to 30 mg 
BID. The cause of death was reported as MI, heart arrhythmia, and hypertensive changes. 
In Study PSOR-008, a 69-year old, white subject, experienced a fatal cerebrovascular accident 
(CVA) on Study Day 777 while in the long-term extension phase of the study. The subject 
received placebo in the placebocontrolled treatment phase, followed by APR 30 BID for a total of 
666 days. On Study Day 777 (Day 666 on active treatment), while at home, the subject began 
experiencing symptoms of stroke (not further specified). In the emergency room, the subject was 
nonresponsive. The subject died in the emergency room due to acute CVA. No treatment was 
given. The type of stroke (thrombotic or hemorrhagic) was reported as unknown. An autopsy was 
not performed. A death certificate was not available. 
• 
In Study PSOR-008, a 30-year-old white subject, died on Study Day 111. The subject had 
received APR 30 BID for a total of 104 days. The subject’s medical history included depression, 
obesity (screening BMI = 35.1 kg/m2), and alcohol use. One week after the last dose of study 
drug, the subject was found dead by the subject’s partner. No obvious cause of death was 
identified. The autopsy report revealed diffuse lung congestion and bilateral edema, consistent 
with acute cardiac failure in association with likely sleep apnea and morbid obesity. At the time of 
death, the subject’s BMI was 40.6 kg/m2. 
Investigator-initiated Studies 
• 
In Study AP-RA-PI-0024, an investigator-initiated study in RA, an 82-year-old  subject, died due 
to acute myeloid leukaemia. The subject received APR 30 BID from 31 Mar 2010 to 28 Jun 2010 
(89 days), followed by APR 30 BID or placebo from 28 Jun 2010 to 20 Aug 2010 (53 days). The 
subject was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia 8 months after the last dose of study 
medication. The subject had a history of breast cancer and uncontrolled RA for 4 years prior to 
study entry. Before starting treatment with apremilast, the subject received multiple 
medications, including adalimumab, MTX, and possibly another TNF blocker (dates not provided). 
The subject died 20 months after the last dose of apremilast. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, the subject incidence of serious TEAEs (SAEs) was low and comparable between placebo and 
apremilast treatment groups. The incidence of SAEs was not driven by any single preferred term or 
specific, individual organ toxicity. Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years, there was no evidence of an 
increased incidence of SAEs with longer apremilast exposure (Table 70).

Adjudicated Evaluation of MACE and Potential MACE 
Major adverse cardiac events were defined as TEAEs of sudden unwitnessed death, cardiovascular death 
(sudden cardiac death, death due to MI, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, and death due to 
other cardiovascular causes), MI, and nonfatal stroke. Potential MACE was defined as unstable angina 
requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularization procedure, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and 
rehospitalisation for recurrent ischemia, embolic events, and deep vein thrombosis. 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
Events from 8 (0.6%) subjects in the placebo group, 26 (1.8%) subjects in the APR 20 BID group, and 32 
(1.4%) subjects in the APR 30 BID group were identified for adjudication of MACE or potential MACE; 
events from 2 placebo subjects, 3 APR 20 BID subjects, and 4 APR 30 BID subjects were not evaluable. 
Events were adjudicated as MACE in 0.1% of subjects (1/1411; 0.2 per 100 subject-years) in the placebo 
group, 0.3% of subjects (5/1450, 0.4 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 20 BID group, and 0.3% of 
subjects (7/2357; 0.3 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID group. Events were adjudicated as 
potential MACE in 0.1% of subjects (2/1411; 0.5 per 100 subject years) in the placebo group, 0.5% of 
subjects (7/1450; 0.6 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 20BID group, and 0.6% of subjects (13/2357; 
0.6 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID group Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years in the 
Apremilast Data Pool, comparable results were observed between apremilast and placebo in adjudicated 
events of MACE and potential MACE. No dose effect was observed. 
Most cases of MACE were classified as myocardial infarction. Most cases of potential MACE were classified 
as unstable angina requiring hospitalization and/or coronary revascularization procedure. The reported 
incidence of MACE was comparable with the background epidemiologic data. 
Nearly all subjects adjudicated with MACE or potential MACE had two or more major risk factors (e.g., 
elderly age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus) and additional 
confounding comorbidities (e.g., coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis) that confound an 
assessment of causality. 
Overall, the incidence of MACE or potential MACE in apremilast clinical studies was lower than the 
background rates for similar populations: 
• 
• 
The rate of adjudicated MACE in apremilast-exposed subjects was in the lower range of the MACE 
rate in the meta-analysis of psoriasis patients conducted by Ryan et al and was lower than the 
average from all the IL-12/23 studies analyzed (Ryan, 2011). 
The rate of adjudicated MACE in the apremilast-exposed subjects was lower than that in psoriatic 
arthritis patients in the CPRD or the MarketScan databases. 
Other Cardiac Disorders 
Cardiac Failure 
In the Apremilast Data Pool, during the Placebo-controlled Period, SMQ cardiac failure TEAEs were 
reported for 1 (0.1%) subject in the placebo group, 2 (0.2%) subjects in the APR 20 BID group, and 3 
(0.2%) subjects in the APR 30 BID group. Two additional subjects (APR 20 BID, 1 subject; APR 30 BID, 
1 subject) reported SMQ cardiac failure TEAEs during the Apremilast-exposure Period. 
SMQ cardiac failure TEAEs were reported as serious in 4 subjects, 3 subjects with PT cardiac failure 
congestive (Placebo, 1 [0.1%] subject; APR 20 BID, 2 [0.1%] subjects) and 1 subject with PT cardiac 
failure (APR 30 BID [< 0.1%]). 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 163/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years there was no evidence of an increased incidence of SMQ cardiac 
failure TEAEs with longer exposure to apremilast in the Apremilast Data Pool (0.2 and 0.5 per 100 
subject-years for the Apremilast-exposure Period and the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, 
respectively, in the APR Total group). 
Tachyarrhythmia 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
In the Apremilast Data Pool, during the Placebo-controlled Period, events of SMQ tachyarrhythmia TEAEs 
were reported for 0.2% of subjects in the placebo group, 0.6% of subjects in the APR 20 BID group, and 
0.6% of subjects in the APR 30 BID group. The most frequently reported tachyarrhythmia event was atrial 
fibrillation. Based on EAIR per 100 subject-years, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of SMQ 
tachyarrhythmia TEAEs with longer exposure to apremilast in the Apremilast Data Pool (1.1 and 1.6 per 
100 subject-years for the Apremilast-exposure Period and the Placebo-controlled Period, respectively, in 
the APR Total group). The majority of the subjects with SMQ tachyarrhythmia TEAEs had an underlying 
medical history of cardiac disorder or baseline ECG abnormalities. Three subjects discontinued treatment 
due to these events and 1 subject required dose reduction (Table 71).  
Table 71: Apremilast Data Pool: SMQ Analysis of Tachyarrhythmia During the 
Apremilast-exposure Period (Apremilast Subjects as Treated) 
Adjudicated Evaluation of Malignancies 
Treatment-emergent malignancies were adjudicated and classified as hematologic, skin (excluding 
melanoma), or solid (including melanoma) malignancies. 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
Events from 7 (0.5%) subjects in the placebo group, 16 (1.1%) subjects in the APR 20 BID group, and 29 
(1.2%) subjects in the APR 30 BID group were identified for adjudication of malignancies; all events 
except those from 2 APR 20 BID subjects and 1 APR 30 BID subject were evaluable 3 subjects with events 
that were adjudicated as not evaluable for malignancy events either did not have a biopsy performed or 
based on the clinical presentation a malignancy cannot be confirmed (data on file). 
One event was adjudicated as hematologic malignancy in 1/1450 (0.1%) subjects in the APR 20 BID 
group. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 164/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Events were adjudicated as malignancy of the skin (excluding melanoma) in 0.3% of subjects (4/1411; 
0.9 per 100 subject-years) in the placebo group, 0.3% of subjects (5/1450; 0.4 per 100 subject-years) in 
the APR 20 BID group, and 0.8% of subjects (18/2357; 0.8 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID 
group. Events were adjudicated as solid malignancies (including melanoma) 0.1% of subjects (2/1411; 
0.5 per 100 subject-years) in the placebo group, 0.3% of subjects (5/1450; 0.4 per 100 subject years) in 
the APR 20 BID group, and 0.3% of subjects (8/2357; 0.4 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID 
group. 
Many of the subjects who had events adjudicated as malignancies had a history of risk factors such as a 
family history, history of previous skin cancer, or exposure to agents known to be associated with 
increased risk of cancer. In addition, most of these events were diagnosed in the first 6 months of starting 
treatment with study medication. Based on these findings, it is unlikely that there is causal relationship 
between apremilast treatment and the events adjudicated as malignancies. 
All except 3 subjects (with non-melanoma skin cancer) adjudicated with malignancy events had one or 
more predisposing risk factors that confound an assessment of causality. 
Adjudicated Evaluation of Serious Infections 
The adjudicator classified the events into 4 categories: non-opportunistic non-serious infection, 
non-opportunistic serious infection, non systemic opportunistic infection, and systemic opportunistic 
infection. 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
All 38 events sent for adjudication were evaluable. One event (urinary tract infection) was adjudicated as 
non-opportunistic non-serious infection in 1/1450 (0.1%) subject in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool; this event 
was reported as an SAE by the investigator and therefore sent for adjudication. 
Events were adjudicated as non-opportunistic serious infections in 0.3% of subjects (4/1411; 0.9 per 100 
subject-years) in the placebo group, 0.5% of subjects (7/1450; 0.6 per 100 subject years) in the APR 20 
BID group, and 0.8% of subjects (20/2357; 0.9 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID group. Events 
were adjudicated as non-systemic opportunistic infections in 0% of subjects (0/1411) subjects in the 
placebo group, 0.1% of subjects (1/1450; 0.1 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 20 BID group, and 0.1% 
of subjects (2/2357; 0.1 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 30 BID group. Events were adjudicated as 
systemic opportunistic infections in 0.1% of subjects (1/1411; 0.2 per 100 subject-years) in the placebo 
group, 0.1% of subjects (1/1450; 0.1 per 100 subject-years) in the APR 20 BID group, and < 0.1% of 
subjects (1/2357; 0.0 per 100 subject-years) subjects in the APR 30 BID group. 
In the Apremilast Data Pool, the EAIR per 100 subject-years was comparable for apremilast and placebo 
treated subjects for adjudicated events of opportunistic (systemic and non-systemic) infections. The rate 
of non-opportunistic serious infections was low (EAIR per 100 subject-years of 0.9 in both the placebo and 
APR 30 BID groups, and 0.6 per 100 subject-years in the APR 20 BID group) with no specific organism or 
organ involvement. 
The reported incidence of systemic opportunistic infections is comparable with the background 
epidemiologic data. Based on a review of current clinical safety data, there is no evidence of an increased 
risk of serious infections (including opportunistic infections) associated with the use of apremilast. In 
clinical trials, the EAIR per 100 subject-years of adjudicated serious infections (including opportunistic 
infections) between placebo and apremilast were comparable, indicating no increased risk of serious 
infections (including opportunistic infections) with apremilast compared with placebo. In addition, based 
on a review of the published literature, apremilast did not increase the risk of serious infections (including 
opportunistic infections) compared with background rates.

Tuberculosis 
In addition to the adjudicated serious infections discussed, any reported cases or subjects with medical 
history related to TB were analyzed. In the PsA and PSOR Phase 3 studies, there was no requirement for 
latent TB screening prior to enrollment; it was left to the investigator’s discretion whether or not to test 
for latent TB. A chest radiograph and medical history were assessed as part of study screening. Subjects 
with active TB or a history of incompletely treated TB were excluded from participation. There were no 
cases of TB reactivation in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool, PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool, or Apremilast Data Pool. 
A positive skin test without confirmation of active TB was reported in 3 subjects with no reported medical 
history of TB. 
- PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
In the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool, there were 20 (1.0%) subjects (1.0% in the placebo group, 0.7% in the APR 
20 BID group, and 1.2% in the APR 30 BID group) with a medical history of TB (including latent TB, 
pulmonary TB, and disseminated TB). In addition, 12 (0.6%) subjects had a medical history of a positive 
tuberculin test: 0.6% in the placebo group, 0.7% in the APR 20 BID group, and 0.4% in the APR 30 BID 
group). 
There were no cases of TB reactivation reported in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool. 
- PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
In the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool, there were 7 (0.6%) subjects (0.5% in the placebo group and 0.6% in the 
APR 30 BID group) with a medical history of TB (including latent TB, pulmonary TB, and disseminated TB). 
In addition, 2 (0.5%) subjects, both in the placebo group, had a medical history of a positive tuberculin 
test. 
There were no cases of TB reactivation reported in the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool. 
However, 2 subjects in Study PSOR-008 had a positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Test during the study. 
These cases were sent for adjudication and 1 was adjudicated as latent TB. It is unknown whether the 
subject had latent TB prior to study enrollment as no prior skin test was required. The subject 
discontinued the study for other reasons. For the second case, the adjudicator’s diagnosis was “Fever of 
unclear origin; unspecified bacterial infection”. The subject was discontinued from the study and treated 
with TB therapy without confirmation of active TB. 
Psychiatric Events 
Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour 
An analysis of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviour was conducted based on a search 
using the narrow SMQ terms of suicide and self-injury. In the Apremilast Data Pool, there were 5 subjects 
with SMQ suicide and self-injury TEAEs during the Placebo-controlled Period, 1 (0.1%) subject in the 
placebo group, 2 (0.2%) subjects in the APR 20 BID group, and 2 (0.1%) subjects in the APR 30 BID 
group. Two (0.1%) subjects reported suicidal ideation and 2 (0.1%) subjects reported suicide attempt in 
the apremilast groups (APR Total), and 1 (0.1%) subject completed suicide in the placebo group. 
Depression 
An analysis of treatment-emergent depression was conducted based on a search using the narrow SMQ 
terms. In the Apremilast Data Pool, during the Placebo-controlled Period, the incidence of reports of SMQ 
depression TEAEs (excluding suicide and self-injury) was higher in the APR 20 BID (1.2%) and APR 30 
BID (1.1%) groups than the Placebo (0.6%) group. However, based on EAIR per 100 subject-years there 
is no evidence that depression is reported at an increased incidence with longer apremilast exposure (2.2 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 166/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and 3.4 per 100 subject-years for the Apremilast-exposure Period and the Placebo-controlled Period, 
respectively, in the APR Total group). 
Psychiatric Events PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
In the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, the incidence of 
reports of SMQ depression TEAEs (excluding suicide and self-injury) was higher in the APR 30 BID group 
(1.2%) than the placebo group (0.5%) (Table 72 & Table 73). However, based on EAIR per 100 
subject-years there is no evidence that depression is reported at an increased incidence with longer 
apremilast exposure (2.2 and 4.2 per 100 subject-years for the Apremilastexposure Period and the 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, respectively, for Apremilast Subjects as Treated). 
Table 72: PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool: SMQ Analysis of Depression During the Treatment 
Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 (Subjects as Treated) 
Table 73: PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool: SMQ Analysis of Depression During the 
Apremilast-exposure Period (Apremilast Subjects as Treated) 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
In the Apremilast Data Pool, during the Placebo-controlled Period, the incidence of reports of SMQ 
depression TEAEs (excluding suicide and self-injury) was higher in the APR 20 BID (1.2%) and APR 30 
BID (1.1%) groups than the Placebo (0.6%) group (Table 74). However, based on EAIR per 100 
subject-years there is no evidence that depression is reported at an increased incidence with longer 
apremilast exposure (2.2 and 3.4 per 100 subject-years for theApremilast-exposure Period and the 
Placebo-controlled Period, respectively, in the APR Total group).

Period (Subjects as Initially Treated at Week 0) 
Vasculitis 
An analysis of vasculitis was conducted based on a search using the narrow SMQ terms listed.  
Three subjects in the Apremilast Data Pool had confirmed TEAEs of cutaneous vasculitis, 1 (0.1%) subject 
in the placebo group (rheumatoid arthritis) and 2 (0.1%) subjects receiving APR30 BID (1 subject, 
psoriatic arthritis; 1 subject, rheumatoid arthritis). In addition, there was 1 subject with a TEAE of 
polymyalgia rheumatica in the APR 40 QD group in Phase 2 Study PSA-001 that was non-serious and was 
not regarded as a case of vasculitis. 
In non-clinical toxicology studies in mice, apremilast-related vascular and perivascular inflammation and 
necrosis with resultant hemorrhage (skeletal muscle, abdominal wall, mesentery, mammary gland and 
adjacent musculature) and hepatic infarction was observed. This finding was not observed in other 
species. As a result of the findings in mice, a proinflammatory panel that included antinuclear antibody 
(ANA) and serum antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was routinely measured at baseline, 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12 in Phase 2 Study PSOR-003. In this study, there were no differences between 
treatment groups in the number of subjects with improvement or worsening of ANA titers at the end of the 
treatment phase. None of the mean changes in the proinflammatory syndrome biomarker panel were 
considered to be clinically relevant, and no subject exhibited any clinical signs or symptoms of a 
proinflammatory syndrome. In addition, there were no notable findings in the immunology parameters. 
Furthermore, there were no notable changes in clinical laboratory tests or peripheral blood markers of 
inflammation (white blood cell [WBC] or neutrophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], 
albumin, fibrinogen, or C-reactive protein [CRP]) monitored in the Phase 2 clinical studies.  
Hypersensitivity Adverse Events 
An analysis of treatment-emergent hypersensitivity was conducted based on a search using the SCQ 
terms listed. The discussion of hypersensitivity in this section focuses on the Apremilast Data Pool. In the 
data set analyzed, one apremilast-treated subject experienced hypersensitivity with two positive 
rechallenges leading to drug discontinuation. Another 17 apremilast-treated subjects who experienced 
hypersensitivity continued apremilast treatment. None of the hypersensitivity reactions were severe and 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 168/189 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
none led to drug withdrawal, except for the 1 case described above. In the proposed labelling, apremilast 
is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients. 
In the Apremilast Data Pool, during the Placebo-controlled Period, SCQ hypersensitivity TEAEs were 
reported for 0.1% of subjects in the placebo group, 0.4% of subject in the APR 20 BID group, and 0.3% 
of subjects in the APR 30 BID group. The EAIR per 100 subject-years was 0.5 and 1.0 per 100 
subject-years for the Apremilast-exposure Period and the Placebo-controlled Period, respectively, in the 
APR Total group. 
Overall, SCQ hypersensitivity TEAEs were reported in 19 subjects: 17 subjects treated with apremilast, 1 
subject who received placebo and 1 subject who had 2 hypersensitivity reactions (one while receiving 
placebo and one while receiving apremilast). Of the 18 subjects who received apremilast and experienced 
hypersensitivity, 16 had an alternative etiology, such as environmental or animal allergy, or 
hypersensitivity to non-study medication. 
One subject receiving APR 10 BID in a Phase 2 psoriasis study was reported as having an anaphylactic 
reaction on Day 136 that dose change. One subject receiving APR 40 QD in a Phase 2 psoriatic arthritis 
study 
One subject had drug interrupted and ultimately discontinued due to repeated hypersensitivity reactions. 
The subject had the first reaction (throat tightness, pruritus, and urticaria) on Study Day 27 that resolved 
on Study Day 29. This subject was rechallenged twice with apremilast and had similar reactions (urticaria, 
skin welts, pruritus, throat tightness and rash). The subject’s medical history included asthma, drug 
intolerance to sulfa products, and hypersensitivity to penicillin. The subject discontinued apremilast and 
recovered. 
All other subjects continued their study medication after the hypersensitivity event, with no additional 
events. None of the hypersensitivity events reported in the Apremilast Data Pool was reported as serious. 
Weight Change  
In an analysis of weight measurement, moderate observed weight loss (>5%) occurred in a higher 
percentage of subjects who received apremilast than subjects who received placebo. In the Apremilast 
Data Pool, mean weight change from baseline in the placebo group was +0.11 kg at Week 16. Mean 
weight change from baseline at Week 16 was -0.88 kg in the APR 20 BID group and -1.24 kg in the APR 
30 BID group, and mean weight change from baseline at Week 52 was -1.32 kg in the APR 20 BID group 
and -1.86 kg in the APR 30 BIDgroup. In the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool, where there was a direct comparison 
between APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID, the observed weight loss in subjects treated with APR 30 BID was 
greater than that in subjects treated with APR 20 BID. For the majority of subjects, observed weight loss 
(> 5%) occurred after the first 16 weeks of treatment, while the majority of nausea and diarrhoea events 
tended to occur early and resolve within 4 weeks (Table 75).

of Period During the Apremilast-exposure Period (Apremilast Subjects as Treated) 
Gastrointestinal Events 
Analyses of treatment-emergent diarrhoea and GI pain and abdominal pain were conducted based on a 
search using SCQ terms. Detailed analyses of the duration, onset, and severity of diarrhoea (PT) and 
nausea (PT) during the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 in the PsA Phase 3 and PSOR Phase 3 
Data Pools are also presented in this section. 
Gastrointestinal events, including diarrhoea, nausea, and abdominal pain werre reported as commonly 
associated with the use of other PDE4 inhibitors. The data showed that these events are also associated 
with apremilast treatment, with a dose-related effect observed both for subject incidence of TEAEs as well 
as withdrawal of study drug due to TEAEs. Most TEAEs of diarrhoea and nausea, the most frequently 
reported GI events, were mild or moderate in severity and infrequently (< 2% of subjects) led to 
discontinuation of the study drug. Few TEAEs were reported as serious (1 APR subject for both diarrhoea 
and nausea), with no apparent treatment- or dose-related effects. During the Treatment Duration Period 
Weeks 0 to 16, most TEAEs of diarrhoea and nausea occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment and 
resolved within 4 weeks of onset.

Headache and Tension Headache 
An analysis of treatment-emergent headache and tension headache was conducted based on a search 
using SCQ terms listed. In order to appropriately assess the rate of headache in the apremilast program, 
TEAEs of tension headache and headache were combined in the SCQ evaluation of headache. The data 
showed that headache is associated with apremilast treatment, with a dose-related effect observed both 
for subject incidence of TEAEs as well as withdrawal of study drug due to TEAEs. Most SCQ headache 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity and few were reported as serious, with no apparent treatment- 
or dose-related effects. During the Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16, most SCQ headache TEAEs 
occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolved within 4 weeks of onset.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiograms 
Routine laboratory monitoring included assessment of haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. 
Markedly abnormal laboratory test results were infrequent and transient. There were no cases of LFT 
elevations meeting Hy’s Law criteria. There was no imbalance in renal or other laboratory parameters. 
There was no evidence of myelosuppression with apremilast treatment.  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 172/189 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Based on the results from the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool, mean vital signs assessments (systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure and pulse rate) did not change throughout the Placebo-controlled Period and the 
Apremilast-exposure Period. 
Based on the results from the thorough QTc study (Study CC-10004-PK-008) and the PsA Phase 3 Data 
Pool, the use of apremilast did not have any clinically meaningful impact on the QTc interval. 
Electrocardiogram monitoring with the use of apremilast is not considered necessary. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
With regard to effects of treatment on age, the incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to drug 
withdrawal was higher in subjects ≥65 years of age compared with those <65 years of age in all 
treatment groups. The difference between age groups was more pronounced in apremilast-treated 
subjects than placebo subjects, with a trend suggesting a dose effect. The difference between age groups 
was driven by GI TEAEs. There was no consistent effect of age on other frequently reported TEAEs.  
Sex 
A higher incidence of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal was observed among 
female subjects compared with male subjects across all treatment groups. The results of a PK study in 
healthy subjects demonstrated a modestly increased overall exposure in elderly subjects by about 14% 
and in female subjects by about 30% compared with young and male subjects, respectively.  
Race 
The numbers of non-white subject in the data pools were too small for a meaningful analysis of TEAEs by 
race. Similarly, the numbers of Hispanic or Latino subjects were too small for a meaningful analysis of 
TEAEs by ethnicity. The results of a PK study (CC-10004-CP-018) in healthy male Japanese, Chinese, and 
Caucasian (white) subjects demonstrated comparable apremilast exposure between Japanese and white 
subjects and between Chinese and white subjects.  
Subjects With Renal Impairment 
In patients with severe renal impairment single-dose oral administration of 30 mg of apremilast resulted 
in an increase in overall mean exposure (AUC0–∞) by 88.5% relative to demographically matched 
healthy subjects. These changes in overall exposure did not correlate with the AEs observed in this 
single-dose study. The effect of mild and moderate renal impairment on apremilast PK was not directly 
assessed. However, population PK analyses in 54 subjects with RA or PsA, who had mild or moderate 
renal impairment, did not find a correlation between creatinine clearance (CLcr) and apremilast clearance. 
The apremilast exposure in RA or PsA subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment was similar to RA 
or PsA subjects with normal renal function.  
Subjects With Hepatic Impairment 
In Study CC-10004-CP-011, PK parameters calculated for the moderately hepatic-impaired group 
(following a 30-mg single dose of apremilast) and severely hepatic-impaired group (following a 20-mg 
single dose of apremilast) and demographically matched healthy groups were comparable with each other. 
A majority of the AEs observed were associated with patients with severe hepatic impairment and were 
likely due to their underlying disease conditions.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Effects of apremilast on pregnancy included embryofetal loss in mice and monkeys, and reduced fetal 
weights and delayed ossification in mice at doses higher than the currently recommended highest human 
dose. Apremilast was detected in milk of lactating mice. A risk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded, 
therefore apremilast should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study population and throughout the clinical 
development program. Women of childbearing potential were required to use protocol approved, effective 
means of contraception for the duration of their participation in apremilast trials and for at least 28 days 
thereafter. Similarly, male study subjects who engaged in sexual activity from which conception was 
possible were also required to use condoms for the duration of their participation in apremilast trials and 
for at least 28 days thereafter. 
As of 15 May 2013, there were 21 pregnancies (7 female subjects and 14 partners of male subjects) 
reported during the apremilast clinical trials. Of the 7 female subjects, 2 were either on placebo or the 
pregnancy occurred during pretreatment, and 5 occurred while receiving apremilast. Of the 14 male 
subjects, 3 were either on placebo or the partner pregnancy was reported to have occurred during 
pretreatment and 11 were on apremilast. 
Female Subjects: Pregnancy Outcomes 
There were no congenital anomalies reported for any subject who became pregnant while being exposed 
to apremilast/blinded therapy. The elective terminations had no pathology reports. No spontaneous 
abortions were reported in female subjects receiving active apremilast treatment. 
The 2 live births reported to date with female subjects exposed to apremilast therapy were fullterm 
healthy babies. 
Partners of Male Subjects: Pregnancy Outcomes 
There were no congenital anomalies reported for partners of male subjects who became pregnant or were 
pregnant while their partners were exposed to apremilast/blinded therapy. There were 2 spontaneous 
abortions in partners of male subjects who became pregnant or were pregnant while their partners were 
exposed to apremilast therapy. Live births (9)reported to date in partners of male subjects exposed to 
apremilast therapy were full-term healthy babies 
Age 
The incidence of ADRs was comparable for subjects < 65 and 65 to74 years of age. The numbers of 
subjects 75 to 84 years of age and ≥ 85 years of age were too small to make meaningful conclusions.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Other Drug-drug Interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with methotrexate, ketoconazole, rifampicinn, and oral 
contraceptives (OC) to evaluate the potential effect on the PK of apremilast. 
Co-administration of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme inducer, rifampicin, resulted in a 
reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of apremilast. 
Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin and St. John’s Wort) with apremilast is not recommended. 
Co-administration of apremilast with multiple doses of rifampicin resulted in a decrease in apremilast 
area-under-the-concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) by 
approximately 72% and 43%, respectively. Apremilast exposure is decreased when administered 
concomitantly with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin) and may result in reduced clinical 
response.  
There was no clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction between ketoconazole and apremilast. 
Apremilast can be co-administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole.  
There was no pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between apremilast and methotrexate in psoriatic 
arthritis patients. Apremilast can be co-administered with methotrexate. 
There was no pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between apremilast and oral contraceptives 
containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Apremilast can be co-administered with oral 
contraceptives.

PsA Phase 3 Data Pool 
- Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
Overall, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal were infrequent, i.e., 3.6% of subjects in the placebo group 
and 4.9% of subjects as treated in the APR Total group, including 4.5% of subjects receiving APR 20 BID 
and 5.2% of subjects receiving APR 30 BID. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to drug 
withdrawal were diarrhoea (placebo 0.4%,APR 20 BID 1.1%, APR 30 BID 1.7%), nausea (placebo 0.4%, 
APR 20 BID 1.0%, APR 30 BID 1.5%), and headache (placebo 0.3%, APR 20 BID 0.4%, APR 30 BID 1.2%) 
- Apremilast-exposure Period 
Overall, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal occurred in 7.2% of subjects who received apremilast (APR 
Total group), 6.9% of subjects in the APR 20 BID group and 7.5% of subjects in the APR 30 BID group. 
During the Apremilast-exposure Period for subjects as treated, the EAIRs per 100 subject-years for TEAEs 
leading to drug withdrawal were 7.2 in the APR 20 BID group and 7.8 in the APR 30 BID group. 
The 3 most frequently reported TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool during the 
Apremilast-exposure Period were the same as those reported during the Treatment Duration Periods 
Weeks 0 to 16, i.e., diarrhoea, nausea, and headache. 
PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 
Overall, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal were infrequent, i.e., 3.8% for subjects treated with placebo 
and 4.8% for the Apremilast Subjects as Treated population with APR 30 BID. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal were nausea (placebo 0.2%, Apremilast Subjects as Treated 
with APR 30 BID 1.2%) and diarrhoea (placebo 0.2%, Apremilast Subjects as Treated with APR 30 BID 
0.8%). 
- Apremilast-exposure Period 
Overall, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal occurred in 8.4% of subjects who received APR 30 BID. During 
the Apremilast-exposure Period for the Apremilast Subjects as Treated population, the EAIR per 100 
subject-years for TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal was 8.8 in the APR 30 BID group. During the 
Treatment Duration Period Weeks 0 to 16 for the Apremilast Subjects as Treated population, the EAIR per 
100 subject-years for TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal was 17.0 in the APR 30 BID group. Based on EAIR 
per 100 subject-years, there is no evidence of an increased incidence of TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal 
with longer exposure to apremilast. 
- Apremilast Data Pool 
During the Placebo-controlled Period, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal occurred in 4.5% of subjects in 
the placebo group and 6.3% of subjects in the APR Total group, including 6.0% of subjects receiving APR 
20 BID and 6.4% of subjects receiving APR 30 BID. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to drug 
withdrawal during the Placebo-controlled Period were nausea, diarrhoea, and headache. Overall, TEAEs 
leading to drug withdrawal occurred in 8.1% of subjects in the APR Total group, including 7.7% of 
subjects receiving APR 20 BID and 8.5% of subjects receiving APR 30 BID. Only nausea and diarrhoea 
were reported as leading to drug discontinuation in ≥1% of Apremilast Subjects as Treated, with a trend 
suggesting a dose effect

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
More than 4000 subjects were treated in the clinical development programme. This included subjects 
treated with moderate to severe psoriasis and subjects with psoriatic arthritis. The applicant presents 
pooled safety data from all subjects treated for the proposed indications in the phase 2/3 data pool. 
Within this data pool the applicant presented safety data for each indication, i.e. data from subjects with: 
Psoriatic arthritis (the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool); Moderate to severe psoriasis treated (the PSOR Phase 3 
Data Pool); apremilast datapool in the phase 2/3 development programme comprises all Phase 2/3 
clinical studies that evaluated the safety of apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or 
rheumatoid arthritis. The length of treatment ranged from 29 days (in 1 psoriasis study) to 52 weeks with 
ongoing studies of up to 5 years exposure. The doses used in the phase 2/3 programme ranged from 
20-30mg BID (in 1 study 40mg bd) reflecting the intended dose to be used in both indications. The size 
of the safety database was considered adequate by the CHMP as was the length of exposure.  
The applicant’s approach was considered complex by the CHMP but did provide the incidence of adverse 
events for each indication taking part in the trial compared to placebo. Exposure Adjusted  Incidence 
Rates (EAIR) were used in an attempt to estimate the incidence of these adverse events over time as it is 
likely that patients will be treated for longer than 16 weeks. The use of exposure adjusted  incidence rates 
assumes that the events occur early and that the occurrence of the adverse event is constant over time. 
It is not considered suitable for adverse events with a latency period. As the applicant pointed out, the 
incidence of the gastrointestinal events associated with apremilast may not be constant over time. In 
addition, malignancies may have a latent period from exposure to presentation. The extension clinical 
trials as well as the proposed disease registry and data from CPRD will further characterise malignancies 
and long-term safety as described in the RMP.  
The populations in the data pools were balanced across groups, with over 80% of subjects completing the 
study. The severity of disease, medical history and concomitant medication were also balanced across 
groups. The mean and median weight and BMI were high across all groups. This reflects the population 
studied i.e. approximately half of subjects recruited in North America. However posology is not based on 
weight but subjects are titrated from 10 to 30 mg daily based on tolerability. The CHMP noted a tendency 
towards an increased incidence of TEAEs and SAEs in subjects with BMI<25mg/m2. There was no 
evidence for any difference in the safety profile of apremilast across the subgroups of subjects with 
baseline BMI <25 mg/m2, 25 to <30 mg/m2, and ≥30 mg/m2. The main reasons for withdrawal were 
similar in the placebo and active groups. Weight loss of up to 2 kg was also observed in the Apremilast 
treated group. Weight change has also been described with other PDE4 inhibitors.The applicant has 
provided an analysis of weight loss in subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of those 
subjects with a weight loss greater than 5% did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss 
occured after 16 weeks treatment whereas gastrointestinal symptoms occurred early in treatment. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms do not explain the weight loss observed. The CHMP considered that this 
weight loss could be exacerbated or become clinically significant in subjects with a low BMI who 
commence treatment or in subjects with persistent diarrhoea or intolerability.The applicant has therefore 
included the following statement in the product information: “Patients who are underweight at the start of 
treatment should have their body weight monitored regularly. In the event of unexplained and clinically 
significant weight loss, these patients should be evaluated by a medical practitioner and discontinuation 
of treatment should be considered”. Weight decrease in patients with BMI <20 kg/m2 is also listed in the 
RMP. Subjects who were treated for 16 weeks had no further weight loss after cessation of treatment. 
The majority of subjects were Caucasian however the applicant has completed pharmacokinetic studies in 
Chinese and Japanese populations which revealed comparable exposures. The number of black subjects 
was small but balanced across groups. In some groups PK studies indicated increased exposure e.g. the 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 177/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
elderly and in female subjects. During the procedure the applicant has provided analysis showing that 
although the number of elderly females is relatively small in comparison to the population analysed, and 
the number of those under 60 kg is even more limited, elderly females should not require lower dosing, 
even at lower body weights. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Depression is also a significant adverse reaction, which occurred more frequently in the PSOR group than 
in the placebo group. During the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical trials PSOR, 1.2% 
(14/1184) of patients treated with apremilast reported depression compared to 0.5% (2/418) treated 
with placebo. None of these reports of depression was serious or led to study discontinuation. Depression 
is included in the product information and in the RMP. This was agreed by the CHMP. The results of the 
MedDRA SMQ analyses of suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal behaviour, or suicidal ideation could not 
conclusively demonstrate whether apremilast is causally associated with these events. However the risk 
of triggering suicide and nervousness are also listed in the RMP. 
A total of 7 deaths occurred in the applicant’s apremilast clinical development program and 1 death 
occurred in an investigator-initiated study (in Rheumatoid Arthritis). Of the 7 deaths that occurred in the 
apremilast clinical studies, 6 deaths occurred in the psoriasis studies (3 subjects treated with APR 30 BID, 
1 subject who was initially randomized to apremilast and rerandomized to placebo in the randomized 
withdrawal period, and 2 subjects treated with placebo) and 1 death occurred in a PsA study (APR 20 
BID). The subject who died in the investigator-initiated study was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia 
8 months after the last dose of study medication. Overall, the number of deaths has been low in the 
apremilast clinical program. There is no pattern associated with cause of death in apremilast clinical 
studies.  
The percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs in apremilast Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies was low 
and comparable across treatment groups during the Placebo-controlled Period. The EAIR for SAEs in the 
APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID groups did not increase during the apremilast-exposure Period; therefore, 
there is no evidence that the incidence of SAEs increases with longer exposure of apremilast treatment. 
The incidence of SAEs was not driven by any single preferred term or specific, individual organ toxicity. 
Cardiac adverse events are a frequent ‘other’ serious adverse event. The applicant presented an 
additional evaluation of cardiac events and concluded that based on EAIRs there is no increased risk of 
cardiac disorder i.e. MACE, tachyarrhythmia or cardiac failure with apremilast exposure. Cardiac safety is 
also included in the RMP and more information about the risk of MACE will be further evaluated through 
the PsA and psoriasis disease registry in the EU but also through analysis of relevant data from the CPRD 
at pre-specified intervals (as described in the RMP).  
The percentage of subjects with TEAEs that led to drug withdrawal in apremilast Phase 2 and Phase 3 
clinical studies during the Placebo-controlled Period was low. The EAIR for TEAEs that led to drug 
withdrawal in the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID groups did not increase during the apremilast-exposure 
Period; therefore, there is no evidence that the incidence of TEAEs that led to drug withdrawal increases 
with longer exposure of apremilast treatment. There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation that 
occurred in more than 2% of subjects. 
Seven subjects in the placebo group versus 45 in the treatment group developed malignancy. Most of the 
events occurred in the first 6 months. The percentage of total subjects exposed in the trial who developed 
a malignancy is approximaltely 0.01% which is not greater that the expected background risk. The CHMP 
concluded that there is no indication that apremilast increases the risk of malignancy from the numbers 
studied and the length of the clinical trials. The applicant acknowledged that most estimates of 
malignancy incidence from clinical trials of new therapeutic agents are limited since both the expected 
numbers of events and the study durations are insufficient to provide a reliable estimate. Data from 
ongoing long term studies will provide further data (as described in the RMP). 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 178/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Based on the data provided by the applicant there is no indication of an increased incidence of infections 
on exposure to apremilast. 
The trial population were not screened for latent TB by skin prick test but all subjects had a history taken 
enquiring about previous infection or positive tests and had a chest x-ray. There was 1 probable case of 
latent TB out of 4000 subjects. There are no proposals for warnings concerning either serious infections 
or tuberculosis in the product information as screening for tuberculosis was not required prior to 
enrolment, and that the clinical trial data have not demonstrated an increased risk of tuberculosis, or 
serious infections more generally. This was agreed by the CHMP.  
Three cases of vasculitis were reported from the apremilast datapool. Two subjects had rheumatoid 
arthritis and one psoriatic arthropathy. Two subjects were on active treatment and one was on placebo. 
There were no changes in the proinflammatory panel demonstrated in the phase 2 study PSOR-003. The 
risk of vasculitis is reflected in the RMP.  
The data available regarding exposure in pregnancy is very limited- 11 babies born thusfar. Studies in 
animals have demonstrated an effect on fetal growth and development. The applicant has updated the 
product information stating that apremilast is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Further information on the 
potential risks of aprelimast during pregnancy will be provided through the monitoring of planned or 
unplanned pregnancies exposed to aprelimast in a pregnancy exposure registry in the US and Canada. 
The final study report from this registry will be provided by the applicant (as described in the RMP). It is 
not known whether apremilast, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed 
infant cannot be excluded. Therefore apremilast should not be used during breast-feeding. This was 
agreed by the CHMP.  
Subgroup analyses in the PsA Phase 3 Data Pool and the PSOR Phase 3 Data Pool by various 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity, region, medical history, prior biologic use, and 
concomitant medications) did not identify any safety concerns. 
Based on the results of laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG, routine monitoring with the use of 
apremilast is not necessary. There is no evidence of myelosuppression with apremilast treatment. 
However in subjects with risk factors or whose liver function tests are abnormal treatment with apremilast 
may raise their LFTs. Apremilast does not prolong the QT interval at the doses of 30 mg and 50 mg BID 
studied in a dedicated QTc study. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of apremilast has been well characterized. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in 
Phase III clinical studies have been gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including diarrhoea (15.7%) and 
nausea (13.9%). These GI adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity, with 0.3% of 
diarrhoea and 0.3% of nausea reported as being severe. These adverse reactions generally occurred 
within the first 2 weeks of treatment and usually resolved within 4 weeks. The other most commonly 
reported adverse reactions included upper respiratory tract infections (8.4%), headache (7.9%), and 
tension headache (7.2%). Overall, most adverse reactions were considered to be mild or moderate in 
severity.  
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 179/189 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation during the first 16 weeks of treatment 
were diarrhoea (1.7%), and nausea (1.5%). The overall incidence of serious adverse reactions was low 
and did not indicate any specific system organ involvement. 
The data available regarding exposure in pregnancy is very limited- 11 babies born thusfar. Studies in 
animals have demonstrated an effect on fetal growth and development. The applicant has updated the 
product information stating that apremilast is contraindicated in pregnancy. It is not known whether 
apremilast, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed infant cannot be 
excluded, therefore apremilast should not be used during breast-feeding. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC Advice. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC. The CHMP endorsed this advice 
without changes.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Psoriatic arthritis 
A treatment effect in favour of apremilast (mACR primary endpoint 18.3% at week 16 and 15.8% at week 
24 p<0.0001) was demonstrated for APR30mg BID across the three studies in patients who have 
previously failed or have not responded to prior DMARD therapy in terms of treatment of symptoms and 
clinical indices of articular disease activity both for those on DMARDs (small molecule and biological) and 
for those not on DMARDs at baseline. Improvement in the signs and symptoms of PsA, as measured by 
the modified ACR 20 response at week 16, continued up to Week 52 across all three pivotal Phase 3 
studies.  
Improvement in physical function was evaluated using HAQ-DI score, SF-36v2 physical functioning 
domain score statistically and nominally significant improvements were seen across both these endpoints 
across all three studies at week 16 and were maintained across week 24 and 52. Improvement in physical 
function evaluated using HAQ-DI was supported by a change from baseline in the average HAQ-DI score 
of -0.2 across all three studies for APR30mg BID The HAQ-DI score was also maintained between Week 
24 and Week 52.  
The results of the ACR20 analysis were supported by the results of the modified PsARC, DAS28[CRP], 
EULAR good/moderate response) analyses. A positive treatment effect was also observed irrespective of 
the number or type of prior small-molecule DMARD or biologic used. 
A consistent, improvement in modified ACR 20 responses, compared to placebo, was observed 
irrespective of whether apremilast was given alone (approximately 35% of subjects) or in combination 
with concomitant small-molecule DMARDs (approximately 65% of subjects). 
Improvements in extra articular manifestations of psoriatic disease (PASI-75, MASES, dactylitis severity 
score), and health-related quality of life (SF-36v2 PCS score, FACIT-Fatigue score) at Weeks 16 and 24, 
and these improvements were broadly maintained at Week 52 with continued apremilast treatment. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 185/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
There was no formal comparison of efficacy between the APR 20 BID and APR 30 BID treatment groups 
but in general higher and more consistent responses were observed for subjects receiving APR 30 BID 
over APR 20 BID  up to week 24 (the placebo –controlled period).  
Plaque Psoriasis 
Efficacy has been demonstrated for patients with plaque psoriasis for induction at 16 weeks and short 
maintenance for an additional 16 weeks. Pooled analysis shows a statistical significant difference in favour 
of Apremilast 30mg bid for PASI 75 at 16 weeks ( 26.2 % improvement) and s PGA (17.2 % 
improvement) versus placebo,  and 15.9% of patients achieving both PASI 75 and sPGA 0-1 at 16 weeks, 
with higher efficacy observed at later time points. 
Continued treatment shows maintenance of effect of PASI and s PGA in weeks 16 to 32, and patients 
continued on treatment having significantly longer time before loss of PASI 75, PASI 50 or s PGA is 
observed at week 32 to 52. 
Also patients who were treated with placebo in the randomised withdrawal phase showed significant 
responses following retreatment with Apremilast 30mg BID. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
The pivotal studies are placebo controlled. While this complies with the CHMP guidance and scientific 
advice it would have been helpful if an active controlled arm had been included. The CHMP however 
considered that the lack of comparator data does not preclude impact othe B/R of apremilast. The data 
after stopping therapy (i.e. a randomised withdrawal phase) have not been evaluated in this program this 
would have been useful in terms of evaluating the effect of withdrawal of treatment on persistence of 
effect, the possibility of treatment holidays etc. No radiographic evidence of a disease modifying effect 
with apremilast is available in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The available nonclinical and clinical data 
(in patients with RA) do not indicate that any unexpected, deleterious effects or MRI evidence of inhibition 
of structural damage on cartilage, bone, or joints occur following treatment with apremilast. 
The treatment effects relative to placebo are modest for the primary and key secondary endpoints. In 
terms of improvement of non-articular manifestations of psoriatic disease there was very little evidence 
of a treatment effect in enthesitis as evidenced by the change in MASES scores from baseline.  
Inclusion of patients who have a contraindication to a DMARD therapy in the apremilast indication has not 
been adequately justified. The applicant agreed to update the indication as follows: “Otezla, alone or in 
combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), is indicated for the treatment of 
active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been 
intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy”. 
The CHMP also concluded that while apremilast has been shown to improve physical function. The MCID 
for HAQ-DI in psoriatic arthritis has not been clearly established. The statement: “Otezla has been shown 
to improve physical function” has therefore been removed from the indication by the applicant. 
Plaque Psoriasis 
As a higher dose than 30 mg BID was not studied in the phase 2 dose finding study a full characterisation 
of the dose response has not been shown, however as a clinically relevant effect was demonstrated this 
does not impact on the B/R of apremilast. 
EMA/CHMP/476353/2014 
Page 186/189 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
A justification that the efficacy data support a broad indication in patients in need of systemic therapy was 
considered inadequate, in particular since an active comparator study with a conventional systemic 
therapy has not been presented for assessment. It is therefore difficult at the present time to put the 
efficacy of this product into context with other systemic therapies. The applicant has agreed to amend the 
indication to a second line systemic treatment as follows:”adult patients who failed to respond to or who 
have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, 
methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA)”. 
With prolonged use a lowering and loss of PASI 75 score is observed at 52 weeks compared with maximal 
scores achieved at 24-28 weeks, this is also observed for s PGA. As psoriasis is a chronic condition which 
may require prolonged treatment efficacy data beyond 12 months is not known. However longer term 
safety and efficacy is being explored, both PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 studies are ongoing through their 
completion up to a total of 5 years of apremilast administration, the applicant will provide the clinical 
efficacy data after the completion of these studies (as described in the RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events and risks related to apremilast have been characterised in a large safety database. 
The adverse event profile appears similar to other phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. 
The most frequently reported treatment related adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, headache, 
respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A dose effect was observed for diarrhoea, nausea and 
headache. The majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Weight loss of up to 2 kg was also observed in the apremilast treated group. This weight loss could be 
exacerbated or become clinically significant in subjects with a low BMI who commence treatment or in 
subjects with persistent diarrhoea or intolerability. This has been addressed in the product information 
and in the RMP. 
The data available regarding exposure in pregnancy is very limited- 11 babies born thusfar. Studies in 
animals have demonstrated an effect on fetal growth and development. The applicant has updated the 
product information stating that apremilast is contraindicated in pregnancy. Further information on the 
potential risks of aprelimast during pregnancy will be provided through the monitoring of planned or 
unplanned pregnancies exposed to aprelimast in a pregnancy exposure registry in the US. The final study 
report from this registry will be provided by the applicant (as described in the RMP). It is not known 
whether apremilast, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed infant cannot 
be excluded, therefore apremilast should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Psoriatic Arthritis 
Apremilast is an orally administered treatment that has demonstrated some benefit in patients with 
moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis who have been pretreated with DMARDs both small –molecule and 
biological type. There is evidence that it is efficacious in combination with small molecule DMARD therapy 
and as a monotherapy. There is some evidence of improvement in function and non-articular

manifestations of psoriatic disease. The clinical significance of magnitude of the improvements in function 
and in some of the non-articular endpoints is unclear. No comparator data is available. The 
efficacydemonstrated in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis is modest but a favourable safety and 
tolerability profile, and along with the benefit of an oral route of administration could result in better 
patient compliance with treatment. The CHMP is of the opinion that a second line use of apremilast in the 
treatment of psoriatic arthritis in patients who have failed treatment or can’t tolerate first line treatment 
is approvable. 
Plaque Psoriasis 
Apremilast provides a novel oral therapeutic agent for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis patients who are in need of systemic therapy. The pivotal studies achieved the primary and key 
secondary objective as a statistically significant improvement in plaque psoriasis was seen following 
treatment with Apremilast 30 mg BID. The efficacy demonstrated in the treatment plaque psoriasis is 
modest but considering the favourable safety and tolerability profile and along with the benefit of an oral 
route of administration, could result in better patient compliance with treatment. A justification that the 
efficacy and safety data support a broad indication in patients in need of systemic therapy was considered 
inadequate, in particular since an active comparator study with a conventional systemic therapy has not 
been presented for assessment. It is therefore difficult at the present time to put the efficacy and safety 
of this product into context with other systemic therapies. The applicant has agreed to amend the 
indication to a second line systemic treatment as follows:”adult patients who failed to respond to or who 
have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, 
methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA)”. 
Adverse events for patients exposed up to 12 months have been identified however the majority of 
adverse event were mild to moderate intensity. Longer term safety data is being collected and forms part 
of the RMP .The applicant has updated the product information stating that apremilast is contraindicated 
in pregnancy. Further information on the potential risks of aprelimast during pregnancy will be provided 
through the monitoring of planned or unplanned pregnancies exposed to aprelimast in a pregnancy 
exposure registry (as described in the RMP). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Otezla in the treatment, alone or in combination with Disease Modifying 
Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy and the treatment of 
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed to respond to or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or 
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

On 22 May 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Vfend. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Pfizer Limited. They 
may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the European Medicines 
Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
“Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) recipients”. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report

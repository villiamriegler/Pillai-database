Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for 
Ciambra (pemetrexed) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ciambra, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Ciambra is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Ciambra, which can be found on Ciambra’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Ciambra is a cancer medicine used to treat two types of lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma 
and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer of the kind known as ‘non-squamous’. 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer of the lining of the lungs. It is associated with 
exposure to asbestos: observations from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Croatia, Spain, and Italy 
showed that the areas with high incidence of mesothelioma exactly correspond to the sites of 
industries with high asbestos use. Most patients with mesothelioma are diagnosed between 50 and 70 
years of age. This age profile may be related to the long delay between the exposure to asbestos and 
onset of the disease. The incidence of mesothelioma varies markedly from one country to another. Men 
are at a much higher risk for malignant mesothelioma than women. European findings from 118 cancer 
registries in 25 countries demonstrate a great geographic variation in the annual incidence rates of 
mesothelioma; among men, rates range from around 8 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom and the 
Netherlands to rates lower than 1 per 100,000 in Spain and Poland. Among women, incidence is much 
lower and less variable, with only the United Kingdom and some Italian regions having rates higher 
than 1 per 100,000. Malignant pleural mesothelioma can also occur in children; however, these cases 
are not thought to be associated with asbestos exposure. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men 
and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. In 2012, there were about 410,000 newly 
diagnosed lung cancer cases in Europe.There are 2 types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Non-small cell lung cancer represents approximately 85% of all 
lung cancer cases. At diagnosis, the majority of patients have non-operable, locally advanced or 
metastatic disease (when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body). These patients have a 
very poor outlook, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 6%. The incidence rates of NSCLC are 
often higher among males than females. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Ciambra contains the active substance pemetrexed. Ciambra is a ‘generic medicine’. This means that it 
is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ already authorised in the European Union (EU) called Alimta.  
Page 1/5 
 
 
Because Ciambra is a generic medicine, its benefits and risks are taken as being the same as those of 
the reference medicine. The company provided data from the published literature on pemetrexed. No 
additional studies were needed as Ciambra is a generic medicine that is given by infusion and contains 
the same active substance as the reference medicine, Alimta. 
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
There is no information about the use of pemetrexed in children and in women who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding. Pemetrexed is not recommended for use in children as its safety and efficacy have not 
been established in this group of patients. Ciambra should be avoided in pregnant women, and it must 
not be used in breastfeeding women.

Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also 
describes the risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in 
lay language in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk 
minimisation measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Ciambra can be found on Ciambra’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has no additional risk minimisation measures.

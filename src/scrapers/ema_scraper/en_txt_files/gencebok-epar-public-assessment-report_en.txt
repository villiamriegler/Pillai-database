1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Gennisium Pharma submitted on 12 October 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Gencebok, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 – ‘Generic of a Centrally authorised 
product’. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 July 
2019.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised marketing authorisation application concerns Gencebok, solution for infusion, 10 
mg/ml, in 1ml ampoule. This application has been submitted in accordance with article 10(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended (hybrid application). The originator and reference product is Peyona, 
solution for infusion and oral solution, 20 mg/ml, 1 and 3 ml ampoules. The difference between 
Gencebok and Peyona is the pharmaceutical strength. Gencebok is proposed with a lower 
concentration (caffeine citrate 10mg/ml corresponding to 5mg caffeine base) as compared to Peyona 
the reference medicinal product (caffeine citrate 20mg/ml corresponding to 10mg caffeine base). The 
lower concentration formulation in a single use ampoule (1ml) has been developed to respond to an 
increasing population of VLBW/ELBW newborns. 
Both medicinal products contain the same active substance, caffeine citrate, which is a well-known 
drug substance and belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of psychoanaleptics and is a 
methylxanthine derivate (ATC code N06BC01). It is structurally related to methylxanthines 
theophylline and theobromine. Compared to theophylline, caffeine has a wider therapeutic index, fewer 
peripheral adverse effects and longer half-life, enabling once daily administration. Most of caffeine`s 
effects have been attributed to antagonism of adenosine receptors, both A1 and A2A subtypes, 
demonstrated in receptor binding assays and observed at concentrations approximating those achieved 
therapeutically in this indication. 
The main action of caffeine is acting as a CNS stimulant. This is the basis of using caffeine for short-term 
treatment of apnoea of prematurity, for which several mechanisms have been proposed for the actions 
including: (1) respiratory centre stimulation, (2) increased minute ventilation, (3) decreased threshold 
to hypercapnia, (4) increased response to hypercapnia, (5) increased skeletal muscle tone, (6) decreased 
diaphragmatic fatigue, (7) increased metabolic rate, and (8) increased oxygen consumption. 
The  applicant  claimed  the  same  indication  as  the  one  currently  approved  for  Peyona,  the  reference 
medicinal product which has been centrally authorised since 2009. Caffeine citrate aqueous solution is 
indicated in premature newborns for the treatment of primary apnoea and is intended for intravenous 
infusion and for oral administration.  
The proposed posology is:

* Beginning 24 hours after the loading dose 
In preterm newborn infants with insufficient clinical response to the recommended loading dose, a second 
loading  dose  of  10-20 mg/kg  maximum  may  be  given  after  24 hours.  Higher  maintenance  doses  of 
10 mg/kg  body  weight  could  be  considered  in  case  of  insufficient  response,  taking  into  account  the 
potential  for  accumulation  of  caffeine  due  to  the  long  half-life  in  preterm  newborn  infants  and  the 
progressively increasing capacity to metabolise caffeine in relation to post-menstrual age. Although a 
therapeutic plasma concentration range of caffeine has not been determined in the literature, caffeine 
levels in studies associated with clinical benefit ranged from 8 to 30 mg/l and no safety concerns have 
normally  been  raised  with  plasma  levels  below  50 mg/l.  More  detailed  dosage  adjustments  and 
monitoring requirements are described in the Product Information. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for infusion containing 10 mg caffeine citrate 
(equivalent to 5 mg caffeine) as active substance.  
The solution for infusion is a clear, colourless, aqueous solution with a pH of 4.8 and osmolality of 65-
95 mOsmol/kg.  
Other ingredients are citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate and water for injections. 
The product is available in type I clear glass 1 ml ampoule coded by 2 blue rings, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylpurine-2,6-dione, corresponding to the molecular 
formula C8H10N4O2. Caffeine has a relative molecular mass of 194.2 and the following structure: 
Gencebok - Assessment report  
EMA/372967/2020  
Page 7/25 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Caffeine structure 
As described in the active substance specification, caffeine is a white or almost white, crystalline 
powder or soft crystals; it is sparingly soluble in water, freely soluble in boiling water, slightly soluble 
in ethanol (96 per cent).  
As there is a monograph of caffeine in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), the manufacturer of 
the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
for caffeine which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. No 
information has been provided on the characterisation of the active substance and on its 
polymorphism. This is acceptable as the active substance is supported by CEP and it is present in 
solution in the finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the CEP. In the CEP it is 
stated that the water is used in the last steps of synthesis; the quality of water is adequately 
controlled. 
The active substance is packaged in a container consisting of fibre drums or  big bags lined with low-
density polyethylene bag, as described in the CEP.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, colour, identification (melting point, 
IR, loss on drying), appearance of solution, acidity, sulfates, related substances (HPLC), loss on drying, 
sulfated ash, assay on dried substance and bacterial endotoxins (BET). All the test methods are 
pharmacopoeial. 
Gencebok - Assessment report  
EMA/372967/2020  
Page 8/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. Since the finished product is sterile, the finished product manufacturer has included the 
test for bacterial endotoxins (BET) (as per Ph. Eur. 2.6.14) in the specification of the active substance.  
The CEP holder specification includes a test for particle size distribution; since the active substance is 
in solution in the finished product, this test is not included in the specification as applied by the 
finished product manufacturer, this is acceptable. 
The BET has been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2.  
Batch analysis data of 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
A retest period of 60 months, if stored in the named container, is stated in the CEP. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product Gencebok is a clear, colourless, sterile solution for infusion containing 10 mg/ml of 
caffeine citrate equivalent to 5 mg/ml of caffeine base.  
Gencebok pharmaceutical form is stated in the PI as “solution for infusion” which differs from the 
pharmaceutical form stated in the PI of the reference product (solution for infusion and oral solution). 
“Solution for infusion and oral solution” has been deprecated from the EDQM Standard terminology 
database since 2014 for safety reasons. In line with the reference product, the finished product can be 
administered orally (including by nasogastric tube), as stated in the respective sections of the SmPC. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a sterile solution for infusion (and oral 
administration) with the same qualitative composition of the reference product and the USP respective 
monograph. The proposed strength of the active substance is half the strength of the reference 
product to allow the maintenance daily doses of 5 mg per kg body weight in the treatment of 
premature newborns without requiring a dilution of the finished product to obtain the needed 
concentration.  
The applicant has studied appearance, impurity profile, assay, pH and osmolality of the reference 
product and confirmed comparability with the proposed product for the named attributes. In order to 
assure the targeted pH value 4.2 to 5.2 (as per USP monograph and EPAR of the reference product), 
the use of 0.1N sodium hydroxide was considered, however, it was concluded to be not necessary. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The specification of 
both citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate (dihydrate) includes the pharmacopoeial BET. Nitrogen 
is an inerting gas used during the manufacture of the bulk solution, filtration and filling of the finished 
product. Its specification complies with Ph.Eur.. 
Gencebok - Assessment report  
EMA/372967/2020  
Page 9/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The finished product is for single use only, hence neither preservatives nor antioxidants are included in 
the formulation. It can be either used without dilution or diluted in sterile solutions for infusion such as 
glucose 50 mg/ml (5%), or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or calcium gluconate 100 mg/ml (10%). 
As the formulation is qualitatively the same as the one of the reference product, with the concentration 
of the active substance being half of the concentration of the reference product, no compatibility or in-
use differences are expected after the optional dilution in the mentioned diluents. Nevertheless, the 
applicant has provided compatibility studies data for up to 24 hours after dilution, confirming the 
compatibility with the three named solutions for infusion, the results of the in-use compatibility studies 
have been reported in the Stability section. The applicant has used the same statement in the SmPC as 
the reference product in reference to the nasogastric administration of the product via an enteral 
feeding tube without providing supporting data. This is considered acceptable since the finished 
product is a solution, it has the same qualitative composition and pH of the reference product and it 
requires relatively short administration time. 
From a manufacturing development perspective, the applicant employs terminal sterilisation, 
performed on the filled ampoules as per Ph. Eur. requirements. As per guidance, terminal sterilisation 
at Ph. Eur. conditions is the preferred sterilisation method; hence its use does not require further 
justification. Product compatibility with the filters used during manufacturing has been demonstrated 
based on the contact period of 5 days. Extractables from the filters have also been evaluated and do 
not pose concern. Manufacturing development studies are considered adequate. 
As detailed in the clinical section of the report, a bioequivalence study is not required for either routes 
of administrations (intravenous and oral) as the both the reference and  the proposed product have the 
same salt form of the active substance and qualitative composition,  are aqueous solutions, the 
excipients are not known to have any interaction with the active substance or to adversely affect the 
GI transit, absorption, in vivo solubility  or the solubility of the active substance; hence the reference 
product meets the requirements as outlined in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr). 
The primary packaging is Type I clear glass 1 ml ampoule coded by 2 blue rings. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. requirements. The same container is used for the reference product. The filling volume of 
the proposed finished product is 1 ml (compared to 1 ml and 3 ml of the reference product). The 
applicant sufficiently justified the development of the smaller ampule size based on maintenance daily 
doses of the product. The results of performed breakage tests provided during the procedure 
demonstrate that the risk of glass fragments entering the ampoule is very low. Hence, special 
precautions (filtering before use) are deemed not necessary. This is also in line with the reference 
product. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard process for this kind of formulations. Terminal sterilisation is 
performed in line with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 
The process has been described in sufficient details. Exceptions to the general practice (autoclave failure, 
weekends) are managed under GMP. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Although the manufacturing process is a standard manufacturing process, satisfactory validation data 
on three commercial scale batches has been provided. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance of the ampule, including ring colour (visual), appearance of solution (clarity and colour, Ph. 
Eur.), identification of caffeine (by HPLC and UV), identification of citrate (USP), extractable volume (Ph. 
Eur.), particulate contamination subvisible and visible particles (Ph. Eur.), assay (caffeine citrate, HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification includes a test for osmolality. The solution is hypo-osmolar (65-95 mOsml/kg) which 
has no impact for the oral administration route. A syringe infusion pump or other metered infusion 
devices are used for the slow intravenous infusion administration over 10 minutes; this prevent the 
risks of haemolysis observed with classic infusion. Batch data confirms the consistency of the 
osmolality also through supportive stability studies on 3 validation batches and 1 pilot batch for up to 6 
months both under long-term and accelerated storage conditions. pH and osmolality are stated in the 
PI. 
The in-house analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for identity, assay and impurities testing has been presented and it is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 2 
batches using validated analytical ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE (option 3 of ICH Q3D). Based 
on the risk assessment and the presented batch, data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to 
include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
To address a major objection raised during the procedure, the applicant has performed a risk 
assessment in line with the requirements as outlined in information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorization holders (EMA/189634/2019) and questions and answers on “Information on 
nitrosamines for marketing authorization holders”(EMA/CHMP/428592/2019 Rev.2) and it is 
concluded that no risk has been identified.  
The reference standard for identification, assay and related substances has been adequately 
characterised. 
Batch analysis results are provided for on three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
In response to a second major objection, stability data from four commercial scale batches of finished 
product  stored  for  up  to  6  months  under  long  term  conditions  (30  ºC  /  75%  RH)  and  accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines have been provided. The batches of the 
medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance of solution (clarity and colour, Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination 
subvisible  and  visible  particles  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (caffeine  citrate,  HPLC),  related 
substances (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). Osmolality is also tested in 
the primary stability batches. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
No significant changes have been observed for the tested parameters. 
Gencebok - Assessment report  
EMA/372967/2020  
Page 11/25 
 
 
 
Data from the ongoing stability protocol will be provided as variation once the 36-month long term data 
will be available.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light, as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  The  data  provided  confirm  that  the  finished  product  is  not  light 
sensitive. 
In-use  stability  studies  assessed  compatibility  with  glucose  5%,  sodium  chloride  0.9%  and  calcium 
gluconate  10%  for  up  to  24  hours  for  two  commercial  batches. The  worst-case  scenario  (i.e.  highest 
dilution)  was  investigated;  the  parameters  tested  were  assay,  related  substances  and  pH,  all  results 
were within the proposed specification, confirming compatibility with the named media. Data from new 
in-use stability study, performed in order to meet the requirement of CPMP/QWP/2934/99, where it is 
stated that at least one of the two batches should be chosen towards the end of its shelf life, will be 
provided with the updated stability data.  
Two additional studies (double freeze-thaw cycle and storage under high temperature conditions: 60°C 
± 5°C for 4 days) were performed on one commercial scale batch. Samples were tested for appearance 
of  the  solution  (clarity  and  colouration),  visible  particles  and  subvisible  particles,  assay,  related 
substances and pH. A slight variation in clarity and subvisible particles was detected but the results stay 
within specifications, confirming the good stability of the finished product. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months (without special storage 
conditions) as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Two major objections regarding the finished product stability and lack of risk assessment for 
nitrosamines have been sufficiently addressed. Information on development, manufacture and control 
of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results 
of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the 
product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of caffeine citrate are well known.  
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Caffeine  is  a  natural  substance  and  therefore  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the 
environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is exempt of the need for an environmental 
risk  assessment  (ERA).  No  additional  ERA  is  thus  needed  for  this  hybrid  marketing  authorisation 
application in accordance with the applicable guideline.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific 
literature. It is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. Gencebok is considered to be 
approvable from a non-clinical point of view.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This  is  a  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  under  Article  10(3)  hybrid  application  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC (as amended) for Gencebok, 10 mg/ml (equivalent to 5 mg of caffeine) solution for infusion. 
Gencebok has a different strength (10 mg/ml) than Peyona, the reference medicinal product (20mg/ml). 
The qualitative composition in terms of excipients is the same as for Peyona, based on literature. The 
routes  of  administration,  pharmaceutical  form  and  the  therapeutic  indication  applied  as  well  as  the 
recommended dose regimen are the same as for the reference product Peyona. 
Caffeine is (1,3,7-Trimethylxanthine) a heterocyclic organic alkaloid compound with purine base called 
xanthine, consisting of pyrimidine ring linked to an imidazole ring, structurally related to theophylline 
and theobromine. Most of its effects have been attributed to antagonism of adenosine receptors, both 
A1  and  A2A  subtypes,  demonstrated  in  receptor  binding  assays  and  observed  at  concentrations 
approximating those achieved therapeutically in this indication.

Caffeine citrate is indicated for the treatment of primary apnoea in premature newborns.  
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation.  
No clinical studies were submitted. Since the product is administered intravenously, the applicant claimed 
a biowaiver. Furthermore, similar to the reference product, the maintenance dose could be administered 
per  os.  As  the  concentration  of  the  proposed  drug  product  is  different  from  the  concentration  of  the 
reference product, a justification for the biowaiver has been provided by the applicant.  
The  clinical  overview  on  the  clinical  pharmacology,  efficacy  and  safety  has  been  provided  and  is 
adequate. There is no new clinical efficacy or safety data provided. The clinical sections of the SmPC of 
Gencebok are in accordance with the reference product Peyona. 
Exemption  
The  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1  Corr**)  states 
that a bioequivalence study is not required for parenteral solutions:  
“Bioequivalence  studies  are  generally  not  required  if  the  test  product  is  to  be  administrated  as  an 
aqueous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product.”   
Based on the intravenous route of administration of this medicinal product, a bioequivalence study is 
therefore not required. Bioequivalence can be concluded without further studies and as the qualitative 
composition of the two products is the same, no differences in non-clinical or clinical effects are 
expected as a result of different concentration of the drug product.  
The maintenance dose can be administered either by intravenous infusion or per os (including 
nasogastric tube), in line with the reference product. As the concentration of the proposed drug 
product is different from the concentration of the reference product, a justification for the biowaiver 
has been provided by the applicant according to the general requirements of the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**): 
-  Both products contain the same active substance in the same salt form - caffeine citrate – and 
both products contain the same excipients, qualitatively. The excipients used are not known to 
have any interaction with the drug substance and to affect the gastrointestinal (GI) transit, the 
absorption, in vivo solubility or the stability of the active substance. 
-  Caffeine has a wide therapeutic index; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The  drug  product  is  an  aqueous  solution  with  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  fully 
dissolved.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  the  caffeine  is  well-known  and  linear  within  the  range  of  the  two 
strengths, according to the EPAR for Peyona. 
There are no changes in the routes of administration, pharmaceutical form, therapeutic indication 
and recommended dosage regimen; 
The  clinical  sections  of  the  SmPC  of  Gencebok  are  in  line  with  the  reference  product  Peyona; 
according  to  the  section  5.2  of  the  SmPC,  the  caffeine  citrate  readily  dissociates  in  aqueous 
solution. The citrate moiety is rapidly metabolized on infusion or ingestion. 
- 
The  EPAR  of  the  reference  product  Peyona  states  that  the  comparison  of  the  PK  parameters 
obtained in studies where IV and oral doses of caffeine citrate were administered suggests that 
oral and IV pharmacokinetics of caffeine citrate are similar and absolute bioavailability of orally 
administered  caffeine  citrate  is  nearly  100%”.  This  is  considered  to  be  also  applicable  to  the 
Gencebok - Assessment report  
EMA/372967/2020  
Page 14/25 
 
 
 
proposed  hybrid  medicinal  product  since  the  composition  of  two  products  can  be  essentially 
considered similar. It is not expected that the manufacturing process, different concentration of 
the drug product or different volume to be administered affect the drug release and absorption. 
In  addition,  similar  to  the  reference  product  no  effect  of  feeding  formula  on  the  extent  of 
absorption of caffeine citrate in premature infants is expected. 
- 
To  achieve  the  same  dose  per  kg  body  weight,  the  volume  of  the  proposed  product  to  be 
administered  is  double  the  volume  of  the  reference  product  to  maintain  the  same  amount  of 
caffeine citrate. The different concentration of the proposed product in the proposed formulation 
is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics as the dose to be administered is the same.  
Considering  the  composition  of  the  final  drug  product,  the  applicant  considered  that  the  justification 
provided are adequate and sufficient to support the biowaiver claims.  
Clinical studies 
No clinical studies were submitted. Since the product is administered intravenously as well as orally, 
the Applicant applied for a biowaiver. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to support this application. A literature overview has 
been provided. 
Pharmacokinetic  properties  of  the  reference  product  Peyona  (source  SmPC):  caffeine  citrate  readily 
dissociates in aqueous solution. The citrate moiety is rapidly metabolized on infusion or ingestion.  
The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of caffeine in infants (0.8-0.9 l/kg) is slightly higher than that in 
adults (0.6 L/kg). Plasma protein binding data are not available for newborn infants or infants. In adults, 
the  mean  plasma  protein  binding  in  vitro  is  reported  to  be  approximately  36%.  Following  the 
administration of caffeine citrate, caffeine is rapidly distributed into the brain. Caffeine concentrations in 
the cerebrospinal fluid of preterm newborn infants approximate to their plasma levels. 
After oral administration of 10 mg caffeine base/kg body weight to preterm newborn infants, the peak 
plasma  caffeine  concentration  (Cmax)  ranged  from  6  to  10  mg/l  and  the  mean  time  to  reach  peak 
concentration  (tmax)  ranged  from  30  min  to  2  h.  The  extent  of  absorption  is  not  affected  by  formula 
feeding but tmax may be prolonged. 
Caffeine metabolism in preterm newborn infants is very limited due to their immature hepatic enzyme 
systems and most of the active substance is eliminated in urine. Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) 
is  involved  in  caffeine  biotransformation  in  older  individuals.  Inter-conversion  between  caffeine  and 
theophylline has been reported in preterm newborn infants; caffeine levels are approximately 25% of 
theophylline levels after theophylline administration and approximately 3-8% of caffeine administered 
would be expected to convert to theophylline. In young infants, the elimination of caffeine is much slower 
than that in adults due to immature hepatic and/or renal function. In newborn infants, caffeine clearance 
is almost entirely by renal excretion. Mean half-life (t1/2) and fraction excreted unchanged in urine (Ae) 
of caffeine in infants are inversely related to gestational/postmenstrual age. In newborn infants, the t1/2 
is approximately 3-4 days and the Ae is approximately 86% (within 6 days). The available limited data 
on the dose proportionality suggests the dose linearity for the investigated dose-range (2.5 - 3mg/kg to 
30mg/kg).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic or efficacy studies were presented, and no such studies are required for this 
application. Literature review has been submitted and the SmPC text is based on the reference product. 
Mechanism of action 
Caffeine is structurally related to the methylxanthines theophylline and theobromine. Most of its effects 
have been attributed to antagonism of adenosine receptors, both A1 and A2A subtypes, demonstrated in 
receptor binding assays and observed at concentrations approximating those achieved therapeutically in 
this indication. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Caffeine's main action is as a CNS stimulant. This is the basis of caffeine's effect in apnoea of prematurity, 
for  which  several  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  for  its  actions  including:  (1)  respiratory  centre 
stimulation,  (2)  increased  minute  ventilation,  (3)  decreased  threshold  to  hypercapnia,  (4)  increased 
response to hypercapnia, (5) increased skeletal muscle tone, (6) decreased diaphragmatic fatigue, (7) 
increased metabolic rate, and (8) increased oxygen consumption. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  caffeine  citrate  was  assessed in  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind  study 
that compared caffeine citrate to placebo in 85 preterm infants (gestational age 28 to <33 weeks) with 
apnoea  of  prematurity.  Infants  received  20  mg/kg  caffeine  citrate  loading  dose  intravenously.  A 
maintenance daily dose of 5 mg/kg caffeine citrate was then administered either intravenously or orally 
(through a feeding tube) for up to 10-12 days. The protocol allowed infants to be “rescued” with open-
label caffeine citrate treatment if their apnoea remained uncontrolled. In that case, infants received a 
second loading dose of 20 mg/kg caffeine citrate after treatment day 1 and before treatment day 8. 
There were more days without any apnoea under caffeine citrate treatment (3.0 days, versus 1.2 days 
for placebo; p=0.005); also, there was a higher percentage of patients with no apnoeas for ≥ 8 days 
(caffeine 22% versus placebo 0%). 
A  recent  large  placebo-controlled  multicentre  study  (n=2006)  investigated  short-term  and  long-term 
(18-21  months)  outcomes  of  premature  infants  treated  with  caffeine  citrate.  Infants  randomised  to 
caffeine citrate received an intravenous loading dose of 20 mg/kg, followed by a daily maintenance dose 
of 5 mg/kg. If apnoeas persisted, the daily maintenance dose could be increased to a maximum of 10 
mg/kg of caffeine citrate. The maintenance doses were adjusted weekly for changes in body weight and 
could be given orally once an infant tolerated full enteral feeding. Caffeine therapy reduced the rate of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia [odds ratio (95% CI) 0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)] and improved the rate of survival 
without neurodevelopmental disability [odds ratio (95 %CI) 0.77 (0.64 to 0.93)]. 
The  size  and  direction  of  caffeine  effect  on  death  and  disability  differed  depending  on  the  degree  of 
respiratory support infants needed at randomisation, indicating more benefit for the supported infants 
[odds ratio (95%CI) for death and disability, see table below].

Only Literature data on clinical safety was provided by the applicant, which is acceptable for this type of 
application. The data are considered adequate and in line with the reference medicinal product. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This  is  a  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  under  Article  10(3)  hybrid  application  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC (as amended) for Gencebok, 10 mg/ml (equivalent to 5 mg of caffeine) solution for infusion.  
The reference product is Peyona 20mg/ml (equivalent to 10 mg of caffeine) solution for infusion and oral 
solution, centrally approved on 02/07/2009.  
The qualitative composition of Gencebok, in terms of excipients, is the same as for Peyona, based on 
literature. The routes of administration, pharmaceutical form and the therapeutic indication applied as 
well as the recommended dose regimen are the same as for the reference product Peyona. 
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
Caffeine citrate is indicated for the treatment of primary apnoea in premature newborns. 
No new pharmacokinetic data have been presented, a literature review and a discussion along the lines 
of the assessment of the reference product have been submitted by the applicant and is considered to 
be acceptable. 
An exemption for conducting a bioequivalence study has been proposed by the applicant and has been 
found acceptable by the CHMP. No further requests for the demonstration of similarity of the two drug 
products is considered to be needed. The biowaiver with regard to oral administration has been accepted 
as well based on provided justification and taking into account the composition of the final drug product. 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of the product has been provided 
and is considered adequate. No new pharmacodynamic, efficacy or safety studies were presented, and 
no such studies are required for this application type.  
The  recommended  posology  is  20mg  caffeine  citrate  per  kg  body  weight  (loading  dose)  and  the 
maintenance dose is 5mg caffeine citrate per kg body weight.  
The clinical sections of the SmPC of Gencebok are mainly similar to the reference product Peyona with 
very minor adjustments made in connection with the lower concentration of the current product, where 
necessary.  
The dose of caffeine citrate is calculated per body weight; thus, the lower concentration of the proposed 
drug product increases the final volume to be administered but is not considered to impact the dosage 
regimen. The final solution to be administered has the same amount of caffeine citrate.  
The  product  is  intended  to  be  marketed  only  in  single  1  ml  ampoule.  The  suitability  of  the  proposed 
ampoule size of 1ml has been sufficiently justified as the lower concentration solution is more suitable 
for  the  better  match  with  the  maintenance  dose  (more  commonly  used  over  loading  dose)  in  the 
treatment  of  premature  newborns.  The  Applicant  has  addressed  the  issue  of  potential  risk  of  glass 
Gencebok - Assessment report

fragments entering the ampoule by conducting a breakage test on 10 ampoules. The results demonstrate 
that the risk is low and special precautions (e.g. filtering before use) are therefore not deemed necessary. 
The most common side effects are hyperglycaemia, tachycardia, phlebitis and inflammation at the site 
of infusion. 
The difference in concentration with the reference medicinal product does not pose any safety (in terms 
of  Adverse  Events)  or  efficacy  concerns  as  the  dose  to  be  administered  as  final  infusion  solution  is 
calculated  as  the  amount  of  caffeine  citrate  per  kg  body  weight.  Nevertheless,  some  concerns  were 
raised  about  potential  medication  errors  due  to  the  differences  in  concentration  between  the  two 
products. Therefore, medication errors is listed as an important potential risk in the RMP summary of 
safety concerns. In order to further address this important potential risk, additional risk minimisation 
measures  in  the  form  of  a  healthcare  professional  card  containing  key  elements  about  the  risk  of 
medication error was agreed (see RMP and Annex II.D of the Product Information).  
The pharmaceutical form of Gencebok (“solution for infusion”) is different from Peyona, the reference 
product (“solution for infusion and oral solution”). The term ‘solution for infusion and oral solution’ is no 
longer recommended to be used as a standard term and it has been deprecated by EDQM since 2014 
due  to  safety  reasons.  Therefore,  during  the  evaluation  of  this  hybrid  application,  the  applicant  was 
requested to replace the pharmaceutical form ‘solution for infusion and oral solution’ with ‘solution for 
infusion’. As Gencebok can still be orally, similarly to Peyona, reference to the oral administration use 
remains covered in the relevant sections of the Product Information.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Since  the  product  can  be  administered  intravenously  and  per  os,  the  Applicant  submitted  biowaiver 
together  with  justification  for  not  performing  bioequivalence  studies.  Furthermore,  no  clinical  studies 
were submitted. The clinical data in the summary of product characteristics are based on the reference 
product. Overviews of clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety literature have been provided. 
This was considered acceptable by CHMP.

This application concerns a hybrid medicinal product, Gencebok (caffeine citrate, 10 mg/ml solution for 
infusion). The reference product Peyona (caffeine citrate, 20 mg/ml solution for infusion and oral 
solution) is indicated for Treatment of primary apnoea of premature newborns.  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. The differences in 
concentration between Gencebok and Peyona are in general fully and satisfactorily characterized by 
the published literature and comparative quality data required, and those differences are expected to 
have no adverse impact on the efficacy and safety of the proposed drug product. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The exemption from the necessity to conduct bioequivalence studies has been adequately justified. 
A positive benefit/risk ratio can therefore be concluded. 
Due to concerns about potential medication errors additional risk minimisation activities are required 
beyond those included in the product information. A healthcare professional card containing key 
elements about the risk of medication error was agreed (see RMP and Annex II.D of the Product 
Information).  
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall agree with the National Competent Authorities the final text of a card suitable for 
display in neonatal intensive care units. The card shall contain the following key elements and be 
provided to all neonatal intensive care units where the medicinal product is likely to be used at launch 
of the medicinal product: 
-  That Gencebok is for the treatment of primary apnoea 
-  That treatment with Gencebok must be provided in a neonatal intensive care unit and 
initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in neonatal intensive care 
-  Details of the loading and maintenance dosages and that caffeine may accumulate in 
premature newborn infants because of its long half-life. 
-  That the dose of caffeine expressed as caffeine base is one half the dose of caffeine 
expressed as caffeine citrate (10 mg caffeine citrate is equivalent to 5 mg caffeine base) and 
that prescriptions should clearly indicate that caffeine citrate is to be administered. 
-  That Gencebok is containing 10 mg caffeine citrate, equivalent to 5 mg caffeine base and 
should be administered according to the following dosing scheme:

o  The mother has been consuming large amounts of caffeine prior to delivery or breast 
feeding 
-  That caffeine and theophylline should not be used concurrently 
-  That if caffeine and doxapram are used concurrently, the patient should be closely monitored 
-  That additional plasma caffeine monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary in at 
risk situations such as preterm infants: 
o  With cholestatic hepatitis 
o  With significant renal impairment 
o  With seizure disorders 
o  With cardiac disease 
o  Less than 28 weeks gestational age and/or body weight <1000g particularly when 
receiving parenteral nutrition 
o  With co-administration of medicinal products known to interfere with caffeine 
metabolism 
-  That cardiac disorders (including arrhythmias) may arise in newborn infants with pre-
existing cardiac disease 
-  That all suspected adverse reactions should be reported in accordance with national 
reporting requirements 
- 
In particular, if convulsions, seizures, necrotising enterocolitis, symptoms and signs of 
caffeine withdrawal, medically abnormal decrease in infant weight gain or interactions with 
other medicines are suspected as being associated with the use of caffeine citrate, these 
should be reported to <insert local name and address of Gennisium Pharma>.

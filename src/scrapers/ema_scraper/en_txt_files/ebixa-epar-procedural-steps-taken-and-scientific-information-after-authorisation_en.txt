Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to submit within 2

adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SPC. The basis 
for the CHMP request was the result of a review of clinical 
trials that was performed to elucidate the incidence rates of 
dyspnoea. The events were analysed by dose, seriousness 
and indication. Overall, the incidence rates of dyspnoea 
were higher in patients treated with memantine compared 
to those receiving placebo. No notable differences between 
treatments were found when considered all studies with

The CHMP agreed that the Pharmacokinetic data obtained

once-daily dosing regimen.  
Five clinical studies in patients with AD supported the 
efficacy and safety assessment of the once-daily dosing 
regimen with memantine. In relation to efficacy results, no 
relevant differences were observed when AD patients were 
treated with memantine 20 mg once-daily with respect to 
patients treated with 10 mg twice-daily. In relation to the 
safety and tolerability both regimens showed similar safety

exposure in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is 
required in these patients.  
The extent of exposure in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 30   49 ml/min) is about 
60% higher than the extent of exposure of healthy 
subjects. In these patients the daily dose should be 
reduced to 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 
days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 
mg/day according to standard titration scheme.  
The exposure in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 5 - 29 ml/min) is about 100% higher 
than in healthy subjects. In these patients the daily dose 
should be 10 mg per day.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit/risk profile of Ebixa continues to 
be favourable.  
The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal can be 
granted with unlimited validity, however, the MAH is 
required to continue to submit Periodic Safety Update 
Reports (PSURs) once a year at least until the final study 
reports of the two ongoing long-term (two years of 
exposure) trials are provided. 
The MAH has taken the opportunity to update the 
information on symptoms and treatment required in case of 
overdose.

(PSUR 7), and the review provided by the MAH on specific 
adverse reactions the MAH was requested to submit a type 
II variation to update product information with information 
on hypertension, venous thrombosis/thromboembolism and 
fungal infections as Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) of 
memantine. 
This update was based on a review of the pooled 
comparative incidences of these ADRs from clinical trials. 
The incidence rates of hypertension were classified as 
common (4.1% in memantine treated patients vs 2.8% in 
placebo). Venous thrombosis/thromboembolism were 
classified as uncommon ADRs.

Following the assessment of the 6th PSUR, the SPC and PL 
information following the evaluation of the 6th PSUR. 
Section 4.5 of the SPC has been updated in relation 
to interactions with warfarin and section 4.8 of the 
SPC regarding pancreatitis, depression, suicidal 
ideation, suicide and psychotic reactions. Relevant 
sections of the PL was amended accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
have been updated in relation to interactions with warfarin. 
Close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR in patients 
treated concomitantly with oral anticoagulants was advised 
which is also reflected in the SPC.  
Following PSUR 6, the MAH performed also a re-analysis of 
each individual case report with pancreatitis reported either 
through the spontaneous reporting system or in clinical 
trials. It was concluded that isolated cases of pancreatitis 
had been observed in post-marketing experience. 
Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with psychotic 
reactions, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. 
Although confounding factors cannot be excluded, these 
events have been reported in patients treated with 
Memantine.

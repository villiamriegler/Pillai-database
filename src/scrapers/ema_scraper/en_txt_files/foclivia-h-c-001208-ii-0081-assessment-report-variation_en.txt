Extension of indication to include children from 6 months to less than 18 years of age for Foclivia, 
based on final results from study V87_30; this is a phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicenter 
study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant 
content in a monovalent H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy pediatric subjects 6 months to 
less than 9 years of age. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 4.9 of the RMP has also been submitted. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to bring it in 
line with the latest QRD template. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Foclivia is a monovalent H5N1 pandemic influenza preparedness pandemic “mock-up” vaccine 
containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain (surface antigen, inactivated, egg-derived, adjuvanted 
MF59C.1), 7.5 micrograms/0.5 ml dose. 
Assessment report  
Page 5/91 
 
 
  
 
 
Foclivia was granted approval under “exceptional circumstances” pursuant to Article 14(8) of 
Regulation (EC) n. 726/2004 on 23 July 2009 (EC decision issued on 18/10/2009), with the following 
“Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use”: 
  Medicinal product subject to medical prescription  
 
Foclivia  can  only  be  marketed  when  there  is  an  official  WHO/EU  declaration  of  an  influenza 
pandemic, on the condition that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Foclivia takes due account 
of the officially declared pandemic strain. 
 
In  accordance  with  Article  114  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  the  official  batch  release  will  be 
undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose 
and with the following “Specific obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for the marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances”, still applicable at the time of the present procedure: 
Foclivia is indicated for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  
The initial marketing authorization application for Foclivia was handled as an informed consent of the 
Focetria EU application and, therefore, the data package in support of the initial Foclivia application 
was identical to that of the Focetria dossier.  
Focetria is an influenza vaccine H1N1v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) containing 
A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)-derived strain used NYMC X-181, 7.5 micrograms/0.5 ml dose. It was 
approved on 2 May 2007 as A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). Following pandemic declaration in 
September 2009 the company submitted a type II variation (Pandemic Update (PU)/05) to change the 
strain from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). The MA 
of Focetria expired on 13 August 2015 following the decision of the MAH, not to apply for the renewal.  
The H5N1 vaccine studies included in the original Foclivia dossier were conducted with monovalent 
MF59C.1 (MF59)-adjuvanted A/H5N1 influenza vaccine including either A/Vietnam/1194/2004(-like) 
antigen or A/H5N1/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(-like) antigen. 
Since future pandemics might not be caused by a H5N1 virus, but might be due to another subtype of 
influenza virus (e.g. with haemagglutinin of type H1, H2, H7 or H9), Foclivia can only be marketed 
when there is an official WHO/EU declaration of an influenza pandemic and, in that case, the current 
strain will be replaced by the officially identified pandemic strain via a type II variation, in line with the 
regulatory pathway laid down in the Guideline on Influenza vaccines – Quality module 
(EMA/CHMP/BWP/310834/2012 Rev.1). 
Seqirus is submitting a Type II variation for Foclivia to request an extension of indication based on the 
final results of Study V87_30 conducted to fulfil the post-authorisation commitments. 
This dose-ranging study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of several different formulations 
using varying amounts of aH5N1 antigen and MF59 adjuvant in paediatric subjects 6 months to less 
than 9 years of age. 
Assessment report  
Page 6/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Foclivia is a pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) indicated for 
prophylaxis of influenza in the case of an officially declared pandemic. 
Foclivia’s authorised posology in adults (from 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years) is a 
single 0.5 mL dose containing 7.5 micrograms of H5N1 antigen and MF59C.1 adjuvant, containing 9.75 
mg squalene, for intramuscular administration followed by a second dose after 3 weeks.  
In children/adolescents under 18 years of age the safety and efficacy of Foclivia have not yet been 
fully established. Available data in children aged 6 months and 18 years of age are described in 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Based on the data provided in the present application the MAH concludes “Selection of the optimal 
pandemic vaccine formulation for children requires consideration of several independent parameters, 
of which the benefit-risk profile, and the quality and longevity of the immune response are important 
factors. In addition, other factors such as logistics, vaccine production, distribution and use must also 
be considered. The immunogenicity and safety data support the selection of the 7.5 μg H5N1 antigen 
and 0.25 mL MF59 dose as recommend dose for the paediatric population. As this is the same dose 
currently licensed for use in adults, selection of this dose has the potential to minimize vaccination 
errors and to facilitate deployment in a pandemic setting. However, if alternative strategies in case of a 
pandemic are warranted (e.g. in the event of resource constraints with regards to antigen content due 
to challenges in the ability to manufacture sufficiently large amounts of vaccine), half the licensed 
adult dose (containing 3.75 μg H5N1 antigen and 0.125 mL MF59) or even formulations with a lower 
antigen dose including 0.25 mL MF59 could be considered in subjects 6 months to less than 9 years of 
age.” 
It should be noted that the currently approved Foclivia multidose vial presentation would allow 
withdrawing of different volumes to adjust different dosages. 
Disease or condition 
Influenza viruses are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses (Orthomyxoviridae) containing a 
segmented RNA genome consisting of seven to eight gene segments, each coding for at least one 
protein.  
At irregular intervals, the influenza viruses might undergo reassortment, the process of combining and 
rearranging virus gene segments that can occur when two differing influenza viruses, for example an 
animal and human subtype, co-infect a cell. Such reassortment process results in an antigenic shift 
that causes major changes in the influenza type A haemagglutinin (HA) antigen that, in turn, can 
result in the emerging of an influenza A virus capable of an efficient human to human transmission.  
The emerging pandemic virus should be novel enough to prevail over the seasonal A viruses, and 
because of its novelty, there can be little specific immunity among humans, except for older people 
who may have met a similar virus in the past. This new influenza A virus can then spread rapidly from 
human to human all over the world causing a global outbreak of influenza disease that, because of the 
lack of human immunity, might cause a variable amount of severe disease and deaths. 
Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks of influenza, as the latter are caused by subtypes of 
influenza viruses that are already circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new 
subtypes or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time.  
Assessment report  
Page 7/91 
 
 
  
 
Influenza pandemics are unpredictable and occur infrequently but have consequences on human health 
and economic well-being (WHO, 2017). Previous experience with the 2009 swine-origin influenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic showed that children were the most affected age category (Jain, 2009; Miller, 
2010), probably due to higher exposure in schools or the lack of pre-existing immunity as seen in the 
elderly, who have likely encountered the virus earlier in life (Cobey, 2017). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
In the present application the MAH proposed the following extension of the authorised indication:  
“Prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation  in  persons  6  months  of  age  and 
older. 
Foclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance”. 
The request for the extension of the age indication for Foclivia is based on safety and immunogenicity 
results  of  Study  V87_30,  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  observer-blind,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity and safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant content in a monovalent H5N1 
Pandemic Influenza Vaccine in healthy paediatric subjects 6 months to <9 years of age. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Influenza usually occurs in winter outbreaks or epidemics (in temperate climates). People of all ages 
are afflicted, but the prevalence is greatest in school-age children; disease severity is greatest in 
infants, the aged, and those with underlying illnesses. 
An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population 
has no immunity, and the emergent virus acquires the capacity to spread efficiently in humans. This 
can result in simultaneous epidemic disease in many locations worldwide, with substantial number of 
deaths and illnesses. Preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the last century witnessed three influenza 
pandemics, the "Spanish Flu" in 1918–1919, the "Asian Flu" in 1957 and the "Hong Kong Flu" in 1968 
[Kilbourne, 2006], all arising from avian influenza viruses. 
Avian influenza viruses have several subtypes, but highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, 
have been associated with hundreds of identified human cases since 1997. Between 2003 and July 18, 
2018, 860 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus infection were officially reported to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) from 16 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, America and the Near 
East, with an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 53% [WHO, 2018]. 
Almost all of these cases have been epidemiologically linked to close contact with poultry, and while 
human-to-human transmission has been sporadic, H5N1 HPAI viruses represent a pandemic threat. 
Biologic features-Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B and C on the basis of their core proteins. Of the three 
types of influenza viruses, A, B, and C, the first two are associated with significant seasonal morbidity 
and mortality. 
Type A viruses, which are able to cause pandemics, are further subdivided according to their envelope 
glycoproteins with haemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) activity. 
The virus is transmitted primarily by droplets or respiratory secretions of infected patients. The virus 
binds to and enters the tracheobronchial ciliated epithelium by utilising the viral surface 
Assessment report  
Page 8/91 
 
 
  
 
haemagglutinin. Viral replication then occurs. Peak viral shedding occurs in the first 48 to 72 hours of 
exposure to the virus, then declines and becomes undetectable within 10 days.  
Children and immunocompromised people may shed virus for several weeks. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Influenza is an acute respiratory disease which is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, 
coryza, cough, headache, prostration, malaise, and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. In the 
majority of cases, pneumonic involvement is not clinically prominent. Acute symptoms and fever often 
persist for 7 to 10 days. Weakness and fatigue may linger for weeks. 
People with diabetes mellitus or chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease, are at high risk of developing 
severe complications from influenza A viruses. Severe complications can consist of haemorrhagic 
bronchitis, pneumonia (primary viral or secondary bacterial), and death. Haemorrhagic bronchitis and 
pneumonia can develop within hours. Fulminant fatal influenza viral pneumonia occasionally occurs; 
dyspnoea, cyanosis, haemoptysis, pulmonary oedema, and death may proceed in as little as 48 hours 
after the onset of symptoms. 
Management 
In the event of an influenza pandemic, vaccines are the most effective means of preventing and 
controlling the spread of influenza in the human population.  
Foclivia is a monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, egg-derived, 
adjuvanted with MF59, manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for a 
centralised authorised seasonal influenza vaccine “Fluad Tetra” (Seqirus, 65 years of age and older).) 
and a nationally authorised seasonal Influenza vaccine “Fluad” (Seqirus, 65 years of age and older), a 
trivalent influenza vaccine licensed in several EU countries through a Mutual Recognition Procedure 
(MRP). 
In order to provide a suitable network capacity for Foclivia in support of pandemic preparedness, 
different manufacturing sites are currently approved. With reference to Drug Product manufacturing 
activities, several manufacturing sites resulted currently approved for the manufacturing of either the 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) Foclivia presentation (3 manufacturing sites) or the multidose vial 
presentations (2 manufacturing sites).  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Foclivia is an egg-based monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, 
MF59C.1 adjuvanted).  
The  vaccine  contains  purified  HA  and  NA  surface  antigens  from  an  influenza  virus  with  a  pandemic 
potential.  In  the  event  of  an  influenza  pandemic  being  declared,  the  Foclivia  Drug  Product  would  be 
modified accordingly with the declared strain. 
The MF59C.1 adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion, composed mainly of squalene that is an 
intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol.  
The  vaccine  is  presented  as  a  suspension  for  injection.  The  following  presentations  are  actually 
authorised in EU for Foclivia: 
Assessment report  
Page 9/91 
 
 
  
 
 
Since  Foclivia  can  only  be  marketed  when  there  is  an  official  WHO/EU  declaration  of  an  influenza 
pandemic, no Foclivia batches have ever been manufactured and released in the EU market since the 
date of marketing authorization granting. 
Foclivia is indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation and should 
be used in accordance with Official Guidance. The product is not indicated for prophylactic use during 
the pre-pandemic period. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Development programme 
The purpose of this study V87_30 was to provide additional clinical data on a paediatric aH5N1 dose in 
anticipation of an avian influenza pandemic, as agreed in the paediatric investigational plan (PIP) with 
the EMA/Paediatric Committee Compliance with CHMP guidance. 
The most relevant CHMP guidelines applied is: “Guideline on Influenza vaccines; Non-clinical and 
Clinical Module” (CPMP/VWP/457259/2014) 
Scientific Advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The clinical trial V87_30 included in this application was conducted partly outside the European Union 
(Philippines).  The  MAH  stated  that  all  trials  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice 
(GCP) according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines as well as national 
regulatory requirements, which cover ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study Number: V87_30 
Study Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Immunogenicity and Safety of Several Doses of Antigen and MF59 Adjuvant Content in a Monovalent 
H5N1 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Paediatric Subjects 6 Months to < 9 Years of Age  
Methods 
This  Phase  2,  randomized,  observer-blind,  multicenter  study  aimed  at  evaluating  the  immunogenicity 
and  safety  of  several  doses  of  antigen  and  MF59  adjuvant  content  in  a  monovalent  H5N1  pandemic 
influenza vaccine in healthy paediatric subjects 6 months to <9 years of age. 
Eligible subjects were stratified by age at the time of enrollment into one of two age cohorts: 6 months 
to <36 months of age and 3 years to <9 years of age.  
Within each age cohort, subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of 6 vaccine groups. 
Subjects in each vaccine group were scheduled to receive 2 injections of the assigned aH5N1 vaccine 
formulation 3 weeks apart. 
In this study, the 5 vaccine formulations with decreased content of HA antigen and/or MF59 adjuvant 
(Arms A to E in Table 1) were evaluated together with the formulation containing the licensed dosage 
for adults of 7.5 μg H5N1 HA antigen in combination with 0.25 mL (100%) MF59 (Arm F in Table 1). 
Table 1: H5N1 HA and MF59 Content of the 6 Vaccine Formulations 
Immunogenicity  was  measured  by  HI  and  MN  assays.  Blood  samples  for  serology  assessments  were 
collected from each subject on Day 1 (before randomization), Day 22 (before vaccination), Day 43, and 
Day 202 for primary immunogenicity objective evaluation and at Day 202 (6 months after the second 
vaccination for secondary immunogenicity objective evaluation. 
A total of 420 subjects were projected for enrollment and each participant was to be followed for a 
period of 12 months after receipt of the second dose of study vaccine. 
Based on the final results from Study V87_30, that was included in the initially agreed EMEA-001830-
PIP01-15, the MAH submitted a Type II variation for the extension of the age indication for Foclivia, a 
pandemic preparedness vaccine (formerly known as ‘mock-up’ vaccine) 
Assessment report  
Page 12/91 
 
 
  
 
 
For this vaccine, the strain will be updated with the pandemic strain before its use during the pandemic 
and hence paediatric use is relevant. 
Consistent with the relevant GL on DOSSIER STRUCTURE AND CONTENT FOR PANDEMIC INFLUENZA 
VACCINE MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATION (EMEA/CPMP/VEG/4717/2003) the MAH 
submitted the core pandemic dossier including immunogenicity and safety data obtained with the 
mock-up vaccine containing the influenza virus to which most or all of the population have no 
detectable immunity.  
This was a Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity and 
safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant content in a monovalent H5N1 Pandemic 
Influenza vaccine in healthy paediatric subjects 6 Months to <9 years of age. The two age cohorts 
were randomized into: 6-36 months and 3 <9 years of age, which was considered acceptable and in 
line with the relevant GL on influenza vaccines nonclinical and clinical modules 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014); the inclusion of the younger age group to ensure adequate 
representation of subjects who were most likely to be naive to influenza and therefore allowing for the 
assessment of the ability of the first dose to prime, moreover randomization into age cohorts took into 
account the possible age effect.   
The study design is considered adequate and compliant with GL EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014. 
Results would provide data on the chosen dose, schedule and support the selection of the antigen-
adjuvant ratio.

Day 43. Following Day 43, other vaccines could be administered, including seasonal flu. 
Prior to receipt of the second vaccination, subjects had to be re-evaluated to confirm that they were 
eligible for subsequent vaccination. If subjects met any of the original exclusion criteria listed above, 
they were not to receive the second vaccination. These subjects would be requested to fulfil all the 
scheduled clinic visits and calls for safety follow-up. .  
Subjects enrolled in the study were healthy male and female subjects  6 months through <9 years of 
age.  
Exclusion of subjects with pandemic influenza illness within past 6 months or ever having received 
previous pandemic H5N1 flu vaccination or who were administered with other vaccines within 14 days 
(for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment in this study or who were 
planning to receive any vaccine prior to Day 43 is acknowledged.  
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate to address the aim of the study and to 
describe the target population of healthy subjects naïve to influenza virus. 
In a pandemic situation, children may be very vulnerable to infection and so constitute a special target 
group for vaccination

Treatments 
Investigational Vaccine: aH5N1 
Six different formulations of the aH5N1 vaccine based on combinations of 3 amounts of H5N1 HA 
(1.875 μg, 3.75 μg, 7.5 μg) and 2 MF59 dosages (0.125 mL [50%], 0.25 mL [100%]) were tested. In 
Arm F the currently licensed adult formulation for aH5N1 (7.5 μg HA of H5N1 influenza strain combined 
with 0.25 mL MF59) is reported.

The lot numbers of the 6 vaccine formulations evaluated in Arms A to F are shown below: 
Within a vaccine group, each eligible subject was to receive 2 vaccinations with the assigned vaccine 
dose, with the first vaccination on Day 1 and the second vaccination on Day 22. 
Criteria for Delay of Vaccination 
These situations are listed below. If a subject met a criterion for delay of vaccination, the subject was 
allowed to receive study vaccination once the window for delay had passed as long as the subject was 
otherwise eligible for study participation. 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever within 3 days of intended study vaccination. 
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F) within 3 days of intended study vaccination. 
• Administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 7 days prior to intended 
study vaccination. 
There could be instances when individuals met all eligibility criteria for vaccination yet had a transient 
clinical circumstance which could warrant delay of vaccination: body temperature elevation (≥38.0°C 
[100.4°F] within 3 days prior to intended study vaccination) or acute use of antipyretics and/or 
analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to vaccination. Under such circumstances, a subject was 
considered eligible for study enrollment or next study vaccination after the appropriate window for 
delay had passed and inclusion/exclusion criteria had been rechecked, and if the subject was confirmed 
to be eligible. 
Non-Study Vaccines 
The term ‘non-study vaccine’ refers to those vaccines which will be intentionally given to study 
subjects but not formally included in the analysis of study objectives. No “non-study vaccines” was 
given as part of this study. 
Subjects were not prohibited from receiving other vaccinations during the course of the trial as long as 
they were  not an influenza vaccination administered prior to visit 3 (Day 43). Following Day 43 other 
vaccines could have been   administered, including seasonal flu. 
Six different formulations of the aH5N1 vaccine were tested in this dose-finding study, in details: 5 
vaccine formulations with different content of HA antigen and/or MF59 adjuvant (Arms A to E) were 
evaluated together with the formulation containing the licensed dosage for adults of 7.5 μg H5N1 HA 
antigen in combination with 0.25 mL (100%) MF59 adjuvant (Arm F). 
Criteria for allowing a delay in subsequent study vaccination are set and acceptable. A non-influenza 
vaccination could be administered prior to D43, this is also acceptable.

Objectives 
The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 6 vaccine formulations 
including 1.875 μg, 3.75 μg, or 7.5 μg HA of pandemic H5N1 influenza strain combined with 0.125 mL 
or 0.25 mL MF59, in 2 intramuscular (IM) injections administered 3 weeks apart. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary objectives/endpoints: immunogenicity 
Primary Immunogenicity Measurement: immunological responses to the different doses of antigen and 
adjuvant contained in the 6 vaccine formulations of aH5N1 were evaluated using HI and MN assays 
with egg-derived H5N1 target virus. Blood samples were obtained on Day 1 (prior to the first 
vaccination), on Day 22 (3 weeks after the first vaccination, prior to the second vaccination), and on 
Day 43 (3 weeks after the second vaccination). HI and MN antibody titers on Days 22 and 43 were 
compared with the baseline antibody titers to evaluate immunogenicity. 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to assess by total population and by age cohort, the 
antibody responses to each of the study vaccines prior to (Day 1) and at 3 weeks after the 
first or second vaccination (Day 22 or Day 43), as measured by HI and MN assays. 
The measures of immunogenicity, as determined by the HI and MN assay against the H5N1 pandemic 
influenza homologous strain included the following: 
−  Geometric mean titers (GMTs) on Day 1 and Day 22 (3 weeks after the first vaccination) or 
Day 43 (3 weeks after the second vaccination) as determined by HI and MN assays against the 
homologous H5N1 pandemic influenza strain 
−  Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) calculated as follows: Day 22/Day 1 or Day 43/Day 1 as 
determined by HI and MN assays against the homologous H5N1 pandemic influenza strain 
−  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion (non-detectable to ≥1:40, or 4-fold increase 
from a detectable Day 1 titer) on Day 22 or 43 
−  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion with a titer ≥1:40 on Days 1, 22 or 431 
All primary immunogenicity endpoints are described by vaccine group for the overall study population 
and by age cohort (6 months to <36 months; 3 years to <9 years). 
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety in each study vaccine group from Day 1 
through Day 387, by total population and by age cohort. 
The measures for assessing safety and reactogenicity were as follows: 
−  Percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs that occurred within 7 days 
following each vaccination and calculated for 4-time intervals after vaccination: 30 minutes, 1 
through 3 days, 4 through 7 days, and 1 through 7 day 
−  Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs reported within 21 days after each vaccination 
within each vaccine group 
Assessment report  
Page 17/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
−  Percentages of subjects reporting serious adverse events (SAEs), new onset of chronic disease 
(NOCDs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and AEs 
Safety measurement: the period of observation for AEs extended from the time the subject signed 
informed consent/assent until he or she completed the specified safety follow-up period Visit 7 (Day 
387) or terminated the study early (whichever came first). 
Adverse events were collected as either solicited or unsolicited AEs. Solicited AEs were derived from 
organized data collection systems, such as subject diaries or interview. 
Solicited Adverse Events: the term “reactogenicity” refers to solicited signs and symptoms (“solicited 
AE”) occurring in the hours and days following a vaccination, to be collected by the subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)/caregiver for 7 consecutive days, using a predefined Subject Diary Card. In this study 
there were two versions of the Subject Diary Card: one version for children aged <3 years and one 
version for children aged 3 years and older. 
For children 6 months to <36 months of age, solicited local AEs included injection site erythema, 
injection site induration, injection site ecchymosis, and injection site tenderness; solicited systemic AEs 
included change in eating habits, shivering, sleepiness, irritability, vomiting, diarrhoea, and body 
temperature ≥38.0°C. 
For children 3 years to <9 years of age, solicited local AEs included injection site erythema, injection 
site induration, injection site ecchymosis, and injection site pain; solicited systemic AEs included loss of 
appetite, nausea, fatigue, malaise, generalized myalgia, generalized arthralgia, headache, 
shivering/chills, vomiting, diarrhoea, and body temperature ≥38.0°C. 
AESI: subjects were assessed at each clinic visit for any new medical events or signs or symptoms that 
could possibly indicate an AESI. A diagnosis of an AESI was to be categorized as an SAE and 
documented on the Adverse Events eCRF within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of an AESI 
diagnosis. 
New Onset of Chronic Disease (NOCD): was defined as an illness that started during the course of the 
study that did not exist prior to enrollment into the study and was likely to persist throughout the 
lifetime of the subject. A chronic disease is one that can be treated but for which no cure exists. 
There was no primary efficacy objective/endpoint in this study. 
Secondary objectives/endpoints 
Secondary Immunogenicity Measurement: the persistence of immunological responses to the different 
doses of antigen and adjuvant contained in the 6 vaccine formulations of aH5N1 was evaluated using 
HI and MN assays. Blood samples were obtained on Day 1 (prior to the first vaccination) and on Day 
202 (6 months after the second vaccination). HI and MN antibody titers on Day 202 were compared 
with the baseline antibody titers to evaluate persistence of immunogenicity. 
The secondary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate in each study vaccine group, by total 
population and by age cohort, the persistence of antibody responses to the H5N1 vaccine strain 
6 months after the second vaccination (Day 202) as measured by HI and MN assays. 
The measures of persistence of antibody responses on Day 202 to study vaccine after primary 
vaccinations, as determined by the HI and MN assays against the H5N1 pandemic influenza 
homologous strain: 
−  Geometric mean titers on Day 1 and Day 202 (6 months after the second vaccination) as 
determined by HI and MN assays 
Assessment report  
Page 18/91 
 
 
  
 
 
−  Geometric mean ratios calculated as follows: Day 202/Day 1 as determined by HI and MN 
assays 
−  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion (non-detectable to ≥1:40, or 4-fold increase 
from a detectable Day 1 titer) on Day 202 
−  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion with a titer of ≥1:40 on Day 202 
All secondary immunogenicity endpoints were described by vaccine group and by age cohort (6 months 
to <36 months; 3 years to <9 years). 
There was no secondary efficacy objective/endpoint in this study. 
Primary and secondary objectives are adequate to the aim of the study and in line with the GL 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014 requirements. Immunogenicity assessment, using HI and MN assays, is 
comprehensive of the immunological data generated by standard approach such as GMTs with 95% 
confidence intervals and GMRs, seroconversion rates, persistence, required by regulatory guidelines. 
Timing of sampling seems adequate to the 2-dose vaccination scheme, however it is of note that for 
adjuvanted seasonal vaccines follow-up of persistence of response should be investigated up to 12 
months after completion of the initial regimen to investigate the need for annual revaccination. 
However, in the V87_30 study this period is shorter (the last measurement is set at 6 months from 
second vaccine dose), but this may be reasonable for a vaccine intended for H5/N1 pandemic 
response.  
Absence of efficacy endpoints is acceptable since it is not expected that clinical efficacy should/can be 
established at the time of the marketing authorisation. 
Exploratory Objectives and Endpoints 
The exploratory objective was to further evaluate the antibody responses to seasonal, and/or 
homologous and/or heterologous pandemic influenza strain(s) by vaccine group on Days 1, 22, 43, and 
202, as measured by HI, MN, or single radial hemolysis (SRH) assays (depending on availability of 
adequate sera and on assay availability). 
Sample size 
This was a dose-ranging study without inferential hypothesis testing. A total number of 420 subjects 
were planned to be enrolled in the study. This number of subjects should provide sufficiently accurate 
estimates of the GMT to evaluate the paediatric dose. Assuming an exclusion rate of up to 14% of 
subjects from the analysis, around 180 subjects per age cohort would be included in the analysis. With 
equal allocation to one of 6 vaccine groups, at least 60 subjects were expected per vaccine group and 
at least 30 subjects per vaccine group and age cohort were expected to be evaluable for the statistical 
analysis. No formal power calculations were done.  
All data was analysed descriptively. Statistical analyses of the immunogenicity endpoints included point 
estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals (Cis). However, the accuracy of the estimates 
of the GMTs can be illustrated by the length of the 95% CIs. Assuming an SD of log10–transformed HI 
titers as 0.7 (based on studies V87_25 and V87_26 in healthy elderly adults): 
• With n=30 per dose group per age cohort, the 95% CI will be from 0.56 to 1.78 times the GMT 
estimate 
• With n=60 per dose group; the 95% CI will be from 0.67 to 1.50 times the GMT estimate 
As the decision on objectives does not involve testing procedures, adjustment for multiplicity is not 
applicable. 
Assessment report  
Page 19/91 
 
 
  
 
Sample size was not based on formal power calculations. The minimum number of subjects expected 
to be evaluable for statistical analysis was calculated as at least 30 subjects per vaccine group and age 
cohort to provide a specific width of 95%CI around the GMT estimate based on HI titers from previous 
studies in adult subjects.  
Results are merely descriptive and no pairwise dose-group comparisons are shown. 
Randomisation 
Subject identification (ID) was manually entered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Subject 
information and stratification information (i.e., age) were automatically transferred to the interactive 
response technology (IRT) system for randomization in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio into 6 treatment groups 
and automatically assigned a unique pack ID.  
Randomization was stratified by age (cohorts of 6 months to <36 months and 3 years to <9 years) 
and by site. The age cohorts were planned to be of equal size. Once an age cohort attained its planned 
size (i.e., half of the planned study sample size), the randomization in this age cohort would be 
blocked. 
The randomization approach and scheme are acceptable. Stratification according to age cohorts is of 
importance to exclude the age impact on immune response, and, as stated before, inclusion of the 
younger cohort allows to obtain a population characterized by low/absent pre-existing influenza 
immunity subjects. Site randomization is also acknowledged. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an observer-blind study. 
Vaccine preparation and administration were to be completed by the designated unblinded team 
members. Any other subject related assessments were to be performed by the PI and/or blinded staff 
members as applicable. Sponsor personnel, except the Clinical Vaccines Management (CVM) team 
(which is responsible for labelling, packaging and distribution), were to remain blinded. 
Except in the case of medical necessity, a subject’s treatment was not to be unblinded without the 
approval of the Sponsor.  
Statistical methods 
The analysis of the data from this study was based on the final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 
1.0 (Final, dated 06 May 2022), which was finalized before unblinding.  
In general, summary descriptive statistics of continuous data are presented as number of observations 
(n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max). 
For categorical variables, statistical summaries include counts and percentages relative to the 
appropriate population. 
Analyses set 
The following analysis populations were defined for the study analyses: 
All Enrolled Set - All screened subjects who provided informed consent/assent and provided 
demographic and/or baseline screening assessments, regardless of the subject’s randomization and 
treatment status in the study, and received a subject ID. 
Assessment report  
Page 20/91 
 
 
  
 
 
All Exposed Set - All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who received at least one dose of study 
vaccination. 
Solicited Safety Set - All subjects in the All Exposed Set with any solicited AE data collected, 
including temperature measurements or use of analgesics/antipyretics. Subjects with a confirmation of 
no indicators of solicited AE (for example vomiting is “none” or injection site-induration is 0 mm 
[none]) were included in this population as well. 
Unsolicited Safety Set - All subjects in the All Exposed Set with unsolicited AE data. Subjects with a 
confirmation of no unsolicited AE were included in this population as well. 
Overall Safety Set - All subjects in the Solicited Safety Set and/or the Unsolicited Safety Set. 
Subjects were analyzed “as treated” (ie, according to the vaccine formulation a subject received, 
rather than the vaccine formulation to which the subject may have been randomized). Subjects 
randomized in the wrong age stratum were reassigned to the correct age stratum and analyzed using 
corrected stratum for all safety sets (i.e, Solicited Safety Set, Unsolicited Safety Set and Overall Safety 
Set). If a subject was unblinded during the study, he/she was included in all the safety sets. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) Immunogenicity All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who were randomized, 
received at least one study vaccination, and provided immunogenicity data at any time point. In case 
of vaccination error, subjects in the FAS sets were analysed “as randomized” (ie, according to the 
vaccine a subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject 
actually received). 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) Immunogenicity All subjects in the FAS immunogenicity who: 
• Correctly received the vaccine (i.e, received the vaccine to which the subject was randomized and at 
the scheduled time points)  
• Provided at least the baseline and one postbaseline blood sample, with evaluable immunogenicity 
data 
• Had no protocol deviations leading to exclusion as defined prior to unblinding/analysis. 
All immunogenicity analyses (primary, secondary, and exploratory) were performed in the PPS 
Immunogenicity.  
The primary immunogenicity analyses would be also performed in the FAS Immunogenicity if the 
percentage of subjects excluded from the PPS Immunogenicity was >5%. 
All solicited safety analyses were performed in the Solicited Safety Set; all unsolicited safety analyses 
were performed in the Unsolicited Safety Set.  
Demography and baseline characteristics tables as well as subject listings were produced for the All 
Enrolled Set. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Age cohort (6 months to <36 months and 3 years to <9 years, based on the actual age) was used as a 
subgroup for all study primary and secondary endpoints. 
In addition, as described in the SAP descriptive immunogenicity analysis of the GMTs was performed 
by stratifying for the following subgroups: 
• Sex 
• Country 
• Site 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint Methodology 
Assessment report  
Page 21/91 
 
 
  
 
 
Antibody titers below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were set to half that limit (e.g, 5 if the 
LLOQ is 10). Values above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) were set to the value of this upper 
limit. Missing immunogenicity data were excluded from analysis of the immunogenicity endpoints. 
Imputation methods were therefore not applied. Sensitivity analyses could be considered to assess the 
impact of missing data in case of substantial missing data. 
Geometric Mean Titer 
For the evaluation of GMTs, summary statistics (geometric mean, minimum, median, maximum) for 
the titers are presented by assessment (Day 1, Day 22, or Day 43) and vaccine group for the overall 
study population and by age subgroup (6 months to <36 months; 3 years to <9 years). 
The analysis model for GMTs was a general linear model on log10-transformed Day 22 or Day 43 titers 
as the outcome variable, with vaccine formulation, log-transformed pre-vaccination titer, and age 
subgroup as covariates. From this model, adjusted differences in the least square means (on the log 
scale) were produced with 95% confidence limits for each vaccine formulation versus the Arm F 
formulation (licensed dosage for adults). The estimated difference and the confidence limits were back-
transformed to obtain an adjusted GMT ratio with 95% confidence limits. 
Geometric Mean Ratio 
For the evaluation of GMRs, summary statistics (geometric mean, coefficient of variation, minimum, 
median, maximum) of the relative increase in titers are presented by assessment (Day 22 and Day 43) 
and vaccine group for the overall study population and by age subgroup (6 months to <36 months; 3 
years to <9 years). 
The analysis model for GMRs was the same as that used for the analysis of GMTs, with log10- 
transformed Day 22 titers/Day 1 titers and Day 43 titers/Day 1 titers as the outcome variable and 
excluding the pre-vaccination titer as the covariate. 
Binary Endpoints 
The number and proportion of subjects achieving the binary endpoints (seroconversion or titer ≥1:40) 
were summarized by assessment (Day 22 and Day 43) and vaccine group for the overall study 
population and by age subgroup (6 months to <36 months; 3 years to <9 years). The associated 2-
sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. No formal 
statistical hypothesis was tested. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoint Methodology 
All secondary immunogenicity endpoints (based on the Day 202 time point) were analyzed in the same 
manner as the primary immunogenicity endpoints. 
The statistical analysis was descriptive therefore, no inferential tests were in place. The 
immunogenicity analyses were performed in the PPS Immunogenicity, which was the primary 
population of interest for the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 420 subjects 6 months to <9 years of age were enrolled in the study (All Enrolled Set) and 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the 6 vaccine groups, stratified by age (6 months to <36 
months and 3 years to <9 years) (Arms A to F). All of the 420 enrolled subjects received at least one 
study vaccination and were therefore included in the All Exposed Set.

The majority of subjects (419/420 subjects, 99.8%) completed the study; all subjects received 2 doses 
of study vaccine.

There were 210 subjects in each of the two age cohorts in the All Enrolled Set. The vast majority of 
subjects (419/420 subjects, 99.8%) completed the study; 1 subject (0.2%) died during the study (not 
related to the study vaccine). All subjects received 2 doses of study vaccine. 
Recruitment 
Date of Study Initiation: 19 December 2020  
Date of Study Completion: 15 April 2022 
Participants were recruited in Estonia and in the Philippines. 
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviations in the All-Enrolled Set are summarized in Table 5.  
In the overall study population, 13 of 420 subjects (3.1%) reported at least 1 major protocol 
deviation; 8 of 210 subjects (3.8%) in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort and 5 of 210 subjects 
(2.4%) in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort reported at least 1 major protocol deviation. 
Major protocol deviations were categorized as related or not related to COVID-19. 
Major protocol deviations not related to COVID-19 were reported by 11 of 420 subjects (2.6%) in the 
overall study population (Table 5). The most commonly reported protocol deviation was in the 
“Procedures/Tests” category; 10 subjects (2.4%) had a serum sample collected outside of the time 
window specified in the protocol. 
Assessment report  
Page 24/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Major protocol deviations related to COVID-19 were reported by 3 of 420 subjects (0.7%) in the 
overall study population (Table 5).  
All 13 subjects with major protocol deviations were excluded from the PPS. 
Table 5: Major Protocol Deviation – As Randomized – All Enrolled Set 
A low percentage (3.1%) of subjects reported major deviations; these were classified as COVID-19-
related (0.7%) and not COVID-related (2.6%), and mostly commonly belonged to the 
“Procedures/Tests” category being outside the planned window. Therefore, no potential impact on 
quality of study data is foreseen.

This study was conducted at 2 centers in Estonia and 5 centers in the Philippines: 100 of 420 subjects 
(23.8%) were enrolled in Estonia and 320 of 420 subjects (76.2%) were enrolled in the Philippines 
(Table 6). 
The mean age of the study population was 49.3 months (SD: 30.82 months) and the range was 7 
months to 8 years 11 months, which was consistent with the intended study population (6 months to 
<9 years of age). The stratification strategy was designed to ensure the age cohorts were of equal 
size. The resulting age distribution met this intention, with 50% of subjects being in the 6 months to 
<36 months age cohort (N=210) and 50% of subjects being in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort 
(N=210). As planned, there were approximately 70 subjects randomized to each of the 6 vaccine 
groups, with approximately 35 subjects per age cohort within a vaccine group. 
The study enrolled more male subjects (228/420 subjects, 54.3%) than female subjects (192/420 
subjects, 45.7%). 
The majority of the study population was Asian (319/420 subjects, 76.0%), followed by White 
(100/420 subjects, 23.8%). All subjects were of “Not Hispanic or Latino” ethnicity. 
The majority of subjects (408/420 subjects, 97.1%) had not received an influenza vaccination in the 
past 2 years. 
There were no major differences in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics across 
the 6 vaccine groups in the overall study population. The proportion of male subjects was higher than 
female subjects in Arms A to E, but lower in Arm F (Table 6). A similar distribution of demographic and 
baseline characteristics across the 6 vaccine groups was observed within the 6 months to <36 months 
and 3 years to <9 years age cohorts (Table 7).

Table 7: Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Subjects 6 Months to<36 Months of 
Age and 3 Years to <9 Years of Age – As Randomized – All Enrolled Set 
The mean age of the study population was 49.3 months (SD: 30.82 months) consistent with the 
intended study population.  
The age distribution shows a balanced stratification with 50% of subjects being in the 6 months to <36 
months age cohort (N=210) and 50% of subjects being in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort 
(N=210). Approximately 70 subjects randomized to each of the 6 vaccine groups, with approximately 
35 subjects per age cohort within a vaccine group. The majority of subjects were enrolled in the 
Philippines (76.2%) and the others in Estonia (23.8%). Therefore, the more represented ethnicity was 
Asian followed by White. None of the participants were “Hispanic or Latino” ethnicity. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are similar and balanced across vaccines subgroups with the 
exception of a slightly higher proportion of males (228/54.3%) as compared to females (45.7%). 
Subjects with abnormal function of the immune system due to any cause were excluded; though 
acceptable, this limits generalizability of study results to immunocompromised paediatric population. 
The great majority of subjects (97.1%) had not received an influenza vaccination in the previous 2 
years; no information is provided regarding proportion of subjects ever been vaccinated during 
lifetime.

Other Baseline Characteristics 
Medical History and Concurrent Illnesses 
At least 1 medical disorder was reported as medical history for 104 of 420 subjects (24.8%) in the All 
Enrolled Set. The proportion of subjects with medical disorders was generally similar between the 6 
vaccine groups (Arm A: 21.7%; Arm B: 23.6%; Arm C: 31.4%; Arm D: 25.7%; Arm E: 23.2%; Arm F: 
22.9%). The types of medical disorders reported as medical history were reflective of the population 
age. 
Prior Medications  
Use of at least 1 prior medication was reported by 154 of 420 subjects (36.7%) in the Overall Safety 
Set. The use of prior medications was generally similar between the 6 vaccine groups (Arm A: 39.1%; 
Arm B: 37.5%; Arm C: 28.6%; Arm D: 42.9%; Arm E: 33.3%; Arm F: 38.6%). The most commonly 
reported types of prior medication were viral vaccines (112/420 subjects, 26.7%) and ascorbic acid 
(including combinations; 25/420 subjects, 6.0%). 
Concomitant Medications 
During the treatment period (Day 1 through Day 43), use of at least 1 concomitant medication was 
reported by 123 of 420 subjects (29.3%) in the Overall Safety Set.  The use of concomitant 
medications was similar between the 6 vaccine groups (Arm A: 31.9%; Arm B: 31.9%; Arm C: 28.6%; 
Arm D: 30.0%; Arm E: 26.1%; Arm F: 27.1%). The most commonly reported concomitant 
medications were paracetamol (52/420 subjects, 12.4%) and ascorbic acid (24/420 subjects, 5.7%). 
During the entire study period (Day 1 through Day 387), use of at least 1 concomitant medication was 
reported by 154 of 420 subjects (36.7%) in the Overall Safety Set. The use of concomitant 
medications was similar between the 6 vaccine groups (Arm A: 37.7%; Arm B: 37.5%; Arm C: 37.1%; 
Arm D: 37.1%; Arm E: 33.3%; Arm F: 37.1%). The most commonly reported concomitant 
medications were paracetamol (57/420 subjects, 13.6%) and ascorbic acid (24/420 subjects, 5.7%). 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
All study vaccines were administered by study personnel who were qualified to perform the procedure 
under applicable local laws and regulations for the study site. 
Approximately 25% of subjects reported at least one medical disorder at medical history.  
The use of prior and concomitant medications was balanced across the 6 vaccine groups; the most 
commonly reported types of prior and concomitant medications were viral vaccines (26.7%) and 
paracetamol (12.4%), respectively. Compliance was very high, with all of the 420 enrolled subjects 
receiving both the first and second study vaccination.

Table 9: Baseline Immune Response in Paediatric Subjects Against the Homologous H5N1 
strain by HI and MN Assay (As Treated – PPS Immunogenicity) 
Immune responses before vaccination on Day 1, measured by HI and MN assay, against the 
homologous H5/N1 strain are very low and similar across study arms, with no difference noted with 
regard to age. This suggests that study participants were a naive population.  
Comparison of Immunogenicity Results of All Studies 
Immunogenicity Results (Study V87_30) 
Immunological responses to the different doses of antigen and adjuvant contained in the 6 vaccine 
formulations of aH5N1 were evaluated using HI and MN assays with egg-derived H5N1 target virus. 
Blood samples were obtained on Day 1 (prior to the first vaccination), on Day 22 (3 weeks after the 
first vaccination, prior to the second vaccination), and on Day 43 (3 weeks after the second 
vaccination). HI and MN antibody titers on Days 22 and 43 were compared with the baseline antibody 
titers to evaluate immunogenicity. 
The immunogenicity objectives were evaluated using the PPS subset of subjects.  
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to assess by total population and by age cohort, the 
antibody responses to each of the study vaccines prior to (Day 1) and at 3 weeks after the first or 
second vaccination (Day 22 or Day 43), as measured by HI and MN assays. 
GMTs and GMRs for HI Titers (Day 1 to Day 43) 
The GMTs measured by HI assay against the H5N1 pandemic influenza homologous strain at Day 1, 
Day 22, and Day 43, along with the Day 22/Day 1 and Day 43/Day 1 GMRs, are shown for the overall 
study population and by age cohort in the Table 10. 
The HI GMT and GMR results of these analyses are adjusted estimates.

The Day 43/Day 1 GMRs ranged from 13.77 to 24.98.  
The Day 43/Day 1 GMRs consistently tended to be higher in the 100% MF59 vaccine groups 
(Arms D, E, and F, range: 23.14 to 24.98) than the 50% MF59 vaccine groups (Arms A, B, and 
C, range: 13.77 to 16.38), suggesting that MF59 content is associated with the magnitude of 
the immune response.

The V87_30 study was undertaken to compare in children aged from 6 months to <9 years 6 vaccine 
formulations containing different HA antigen doses and MF59 adjuvant contents, including the 
formulation with the licensed dosage for adults of 7.5 μg H5N1 HA antigen in combination with 100% 
(0.25 mL) MF59, each in a total injection volume of 0.5 mL. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint was assessed by HI and MN assays tested against H5N1 
pandemic influenza strain in the total population and by age cohort prior to vaccination (Day 1), at 3 
weeks after first vaccination (Day 22) and at 3 weeks after second vaccination (Day 43) and measured 
by GMT, Day 22/Day 1 and Day 43/Day 1GMRs, as well as seroconversion rate.  
As expected, at Day 1 HI antibody response was minimal and similar across the six study vaccination 
groups (GMT ranging from 5.00 to 5.24). A slight increase as compared to baseline is noted at Day 22 
at HI GMTs (GMTs from 5.61 to 6.47) with GMRs similar across vaccination groups and ranging from 
1.11 to 1.29. At Day 43 (i.e., 3 weeks after second vaccination) a robust immunogenicity response is 
elicited as demonstrated by GMTs and GMRs in all 6 vaccination groups, confirming that a 2-dose 
vaccination schedule is needed.  
Day 43 GMT and Day 43/Day1 GMR increases were consistently higher in D, E, F arms characterized 
by 100% dose of MF59 content (ranging from 122.43 to 123.61 for GMTs and from 24.35 to 24.98 for 
GMRs) as compared to A, B, C arms conversely characterized by 50% of MF59 content (ranging from 
68.06 to 86.70 for GMTs and from 13.77 to 16.38 for GMRs), suggesting that antibody response is 
enhanced by the MF59 content (50%<100%). This finding was confirmed across age cohorts. 
Regarding to antigen dose, no clear effect on immunogenicity was observed, with lower doses 
achieving similar antibody responses. In vaccine arms D, E, F with 100% MF59 content, HI GMTs at 
Day 43 (122.43, 123.37, 123.61, respectively) and Day 43/Day 1 GMRs (24.35, 24.98, 23.14, 
respectively) did not show relevant differences by decreasing antigen dose. Instead, results obtained 
by MN assay seem to show slightly lower immune responses for Arm D (Day 43 GMT 619.44, Day 
43/Day 1 GMR 119.78) compared to Arms E (Day 43 GMT 864.91, Day 43/Day 1 GMR 168.06) and F 
(Day 43 GMT 766.18, Day 43/Day 1 GMR 144.55). Analysing GMT and GMRs results by age cohorts, as

expected younger subjects (6-<36 months) in respect to the older age cohort (3 years -<9 years) 
seem to show better immunogenicity results, supporting the advantage of using the MF59-adjuvanted 
in priming an immune response in immunologically naive subjects, like young children.  
Regarding seroconversion rate and percentage of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 (overlapping results were 
observed as all subjects seroconverting to titers ≥1:40 also had a 4-fold increase from a detectable 
Day 1 titer), similar results were found with those reported for GMT and GMR response. No relevant 
increase in HI seroconversion percentages at Day 22 were noted across groups. At Day 43, 
respectively 90.9%, 87.0%, 86.6% of subjects belonging to arms D, E, and F reached the 
immunogenicity endpoint, with only 82.1% in arm A, 74.6% in arm B, and 77.6% arm C.  MN 
seroconversion rates at titers ≥1:40, 1≥80, 1≥160 confirm the tendency of Arm E (HA antigen 3.75 µg) 
and F (HA antigen 7.5 µg) to perform better than Arm D (HA antigen 1.875 µg).   
Overall, MN assay test results are consistent with those obtained with the HI assay; however, higher 
antibody titers are observed confirming literature data suggesting the MN functional test (showing 
neutralizing antibody titres) to be a more sensitive than HI method for detection of antibodies to H5N1 
viruses.  
Ancillary analyses 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The persistence of immunological responses to the different doses of antigen and adjuvant contained in 
the 6 vaccine formulations of aH5N1 was evaluated using HI and MN assays. Blood samples were 
obtained on Day 1 (prior to the first vaccination) and on Day 202 (6 months after the second 
vaccination). HI and MN antibody titers on Day 202 were compared with the baseline antibody titers to 
evaluate persistence of immunogenicity. 
The secondary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate in each study vaccine group, by total 
population and by age cohort, the persistence of antibody responses to the H5N1 vaccine strain 6 
months after the second vaccination (Day 202) as measured by HI and MN assays. 
Persistence of Antibody Responses at Day 202 (HI Assay) 
The GMTs assessed by HI assay against the H5N1 pandemic influenza homologous strain at Day 202 (6 
months after the second vaccination), the Day 202/Day 1 GMRs, and the percentages of subjects with 
seroconversion and HI titer ≥1:40 at Day 202, are shown for the overall study population and by age 
cohort in Table 14. 
There were no differences between the percentage of subjects with seroconversion and the percentage 
of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 at Day 202 in the overall study population or either of the age cohorts. 
The results for the percentage of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 are described below; the same pattern 
was observed for the percentage of subjects with HI seroconversion.

Secondary immunogenicity endpoints looked at persistence of immunological responses to the different 
vaccine formulations by comparing response as measured by HI and MN antibody titers on Day 202 
(i.e., 6 months after second vaccination). Analysis was carried out in the total population and by age 
cohort. 
At Day 202, HI and MN assays both showed GMTs and GMRs against the H5N1 pandemic influenza 
homologous strain that are decreased in respect to Day 43 for all vaccination groups. However, Day 
202/Day 1 GMRs were increased in respect to baseline and superior in the 100% MF59 vaccine groups 
(Arms D, E, F) than in the 50% MF59 groups (Arms A, B, C), suggesting that higher adjuvant content 
is associated with longer persistence of antibody response; this was confirmed when analysing data by 
age cohorts.  
The highest percentages of subjects with an antibody titre ≥1:40 (or seroconversion) at 6 months after 
second vaccine dose by both HI and MN assays was found in Arm F (HA antigen-adjuvant ratio 7.5 
μg/100% MF59) with, respectively, 25.4% and 98.5% of the study population. While in respect to Arm 
F, lower HI seroconversion rates were found in Arm D (15.2%), Arm E performed similarly (21.7%) in 
the overall population. Consistent differences across Arms D-F were reported for the two age cohorts, 
that however displayed a superior immune response in younger children (Arm D 27.1% versus Arm E 
33.3% and Arm F 41.9%) than in older children (Arm D 3.0% versus Arm E 9.1% and Arm F 11.1%).  
Conclusively, all immunogenicity endpoints confirmed that a higher adjuvant content is needed to elicit 
a greater antibody response across age cohorts. Among vaccine formulations with 100% MF59, the 
adult and half adult dose showed similar antibody responses, while for the smaller antigen formulation 
lower immune responses were reported; this was even more evident in children aged between 3-8 
years of age. Therefore, the proposed dose for the paediatric population, that is the same as for adults 
(7.5 µg+100% MF59), sounds reasonable. However, a lower antigen dose (3.75 µg) in respect to the 
licensed adult dosage could also be considered.

Figure 5: Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves of HI Antibody Titers for the H5N1 
Pandemic Influenza Homologous Strain by Vaccine Group on Day 43 in Subjects 3 Years to 
<9 Years – PPS Immunogenicity 
RCD curves using MN assay are not reported, similar results to that of HI assay have been obtained.  
Overall, RCD curves for the H5N1 pandemic influenza homologous strain based on HI titers were 
similar across the 6 vaccine groups at Day 22 and Day 43 in both age cohorts. Comparison of results 
at Day 43 with those at Day 22 suggests that MF59 content is associated with the magnitude of the 
immune response.

Notes 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Foclivia is a surface antigen, inactivated, egg-derived, adjuvanted MF59C.1 monovalent H5N1 
pandemic preparedness vaccine (formerly known as ‘mock-up’ vaccine) containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain (licenced formulation 7.5 micrograms/0.5 ml dose) intended for 
prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  
In a pandemic situation, children may be very vulnerable to infection and so constitute a special target 
group for vaccination. The PIP initially agreed by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) EMEA-001830-
PIP01-15 for clinical development of Foclivia in children and adolescents included the following two 
clinical studies:  
-  V87P6, a randomized, controlled, observer-blind, single-centre study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of two doses of FLUAD H5N1 (Aflunov, surface antigen, 
inactivated, adjuvated) influenza vaccine in paediatric subjects from 6 months to less than 18 
years of age (study V87P6, same as Study 1 of PIP EMEA-000599-PIP01-09-M04 and subsequent 
modification thereof). This study investigating only one dose of the vaccine (licenced formulation 
7.5 micrograms/0.5 ml dose) and was completed at the time of the initial PDCO review (Variation 
II/07 adopted on 21/03/2012). Results are already included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
-  V87_30, a randomized, observer-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity and 
safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant content in a monovalent H5N1 pandemic 
influenza vaccine in healthy paediatric subjects from 6 months to less than 9 years of age (study 
V87_30, same as Study 3 of PIP EMEA-000599-PIP01-09-M04 and subsequent modification 
thereof). This study was conducted as a post-authorization commitment to provide additional 
clinical data on a paediatric aH5N1 dose. 
Subsequently, based on the MAH’s request on 10 December 2019 to apply changes to the timelines of 
Study V87_30 by delaying the start (from June 2020 to December 2020) and completion (from April 
2022 to October 2022) of the study by 6 months, the PIP was modified with a positive opinion by the 
PDCO (P/0188/2020).   
With this variation the MAH asked for amending the currently broad/general indication wording in: 
“Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation in persons 6 months of age and 
older” based on the results from study V87_30. However, as Foclivia in the pre-pandemic phase is 
authorised but cannot be marketed, definition of indication and up-dating of section 4.1 in the SmPC 
must be postponed in the event an H5N1 pandemic is declared, and a fast-track evaluation of a new 
vaccine that includes the virus strain causing the pandemic is carried out. Thus, the general indication 
should be maintained until the pandemic variation application, according to procedural requirement for 
influenza vaccines (EMA/56793/2014), is submitted. This is in accordance with previous analogous 
Assessment report  
Page 54/91 
 
 
  
 
 
procedures.  Nevertheless, the posology section has been updated including individuals from 6 months 
of age for which the same adult dose/schedule (two doses (0.5 ml each), 21 days apart) is applied.  
Consistent with the relevant GL EMEA/CPMP/VEG/4717/2003 in this application the MAH has submitted 
the core pandemic dossier including immunogenicity and safety data obtained with the 2-dose regimen 
of the mock-up vaccine containing the influenza virus to which most of the study population has no 
detectable immunity. As expected for pre-pandemic phase applications, no efficacy data is provided.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design 
Study V87_30 is a Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicenter study conducted to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety of several doses of H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine with decreased doses 
of H5N1 HA antigen and/or adjuvant in respect of licenced formulation administered as 2 vaccinations 
given 3 weeks apart in healthy paediatric subjects 6 months to <9 years of age. The monovalent 
MF59-adjuvanted A/H5N1 influenza vaccine included the A/H5N1/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(-like) antigen 
(aH5N1). 
Treatment 
Six different formulations of the aH5N1 vaccine were tested in this dose-finding study: 3 different 
H5N1 HA antigen dosages (1.875 mg, 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg) and 2 MF59 adjuvant contents (50% and 
100%) were evaluated in 5 treatment arms (A-E) together with the licensed dosage for adults (Arm F): 
Arm A: 1.875 μg H5N1 antigen + 0.125 mL [50%] MF59 adjuvant;  
Arm B: 3.75 μg H5N1 antigen + 0.125 mL [50%] MF59 adjuvant;  
Arm C: 7.5 μg H5N1 antigen + 0.125 mL [50%] MF59 adjuvant;  
Arm D: 1.875 μg H5N1 antigen + 0.25 mL [100%] MF59 adjuvant;  
Arm E: 3.75 μg H5N1 antigen + 0.25 mL [100%] MF59 adjuvant);  
Arm F: 7.5 μg H5N1 HA antigen + 0.25 mL [100%] MF59 adjuvant. 
The 2-dose vaccine regimen was administrated on Day 1 and Day 22 in an observer-blind manner 
intramuscularly (anterolateral thigh and deltoid for children aged <2 years and ≥ 2 years, 
respectively). 
Population 
Subjects enrolled in the study were healthy male and female subjects of 6 months through <9 years of 
age. Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate to address the aim of the study 
and to describe the target population of healthy children/adolescents, more likely not to have pre-
existing immunity against influenza viruses. Exclusion of subjects with pandemic influenza illness 
within past 6 months or ever having received previous pandemic H5N1 flu vaccination or who were 
administered with other vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days (for live 
vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who were planning to receive any vaccine prior to Day 43 
is acknowledged. Subjects with abnormal function of the immune system due to any cause were 
excluded; though acceptable, this limits generalizability of study results to immunocompromised 
paediatric population.  
The planned population was randomized with a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio among the 6 study arms into two age 
cohorts: 6-<36 months and 3 -<9 years of age, which is considered acceptable and in line with the 
relevant GL (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). Further, the two age cohorts are acknowledged as taking 
into account possible age effect.  
Assessment report

Objectives 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to assess the antibody responses to each of the study 
vaccines at 3 weeks after the first or second vaccination (Day 22 or Day 43), as measured by HI and 
MN assays. 
The secondary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate the persistence of antibody responses to the 
H5N1 vaccine strain 6 months after the second vaccination (Day 202), as measured by HI and MN 
assays. 
Primary and secondary objectives are adequate to the aim of the study and in line with the guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) requirements. Immunogenicity assessment, using HI and MN assays, 
is comprehensive of the immunological data (Day 1, Day 22, Day 43 GMTs with 95% confidence 
intervals, Day 22/Day 1 and Day 43/Day 1 GMRs, seroconversion rates, persistence) required by 
regulatory guidelines.  
Timing of blood sampling seems adequate to the 2-dose vaccination scheme, however it is of note that 
for adjuvanted seasonal vaccines follow-up of persistence of response should be investigated up to 12 
months after completion of the initial regimen to investigate the need for annual revaccination. 
However, in the V87_30 study this period is shorter (the last measurement is set at 6 months), but 
this is reasonable for a vaccine intended for H5/N1 pandemic response.  
Absence of efficacy endpoints is acceptable since it is not expected that clinical efficacy should/can be 
established at the time of the marketing authorisation. 
Sample size and statistics 
Sample size was not based on formal power calculations. The minimum expected number of subjects 
expected to be evaluable for statistical analysis was calculated as at least 30 subjects per vaccine 
group and age cohort. 
The statistical analysis was descriptive therefore no inferential tests were in place. The immunogenicity 
analyses were performed in the PPS Immunogenicity, which was the primary population of interest for 
the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses. 
Overall, the study design is considered adequate and compliant with GL 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) and able to provide data on the chosen dose, schedule and support the 
selection of the antigen-adjuvant ratio of the aH5N1 adjuvanted vaccine.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 420 subjects were enrolled in the study with comparable numbers in each age cohort 
(n=210) and treatment arms (approximately n=70 in each). Demographics show a mean age of 49.3 
months (SD: 30.82 months), slightly more male subjects (54.3%), and most population being Asian 
(76.0%) or White (23.8%). Overall general characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms. 
Study population is characterized by low prevalence of pre-existing influenza immunity, as almost all 
subjects (97.1%) did not receive influenza vaccine during the previous 2 years; no information is 
provided regarding proportion of subjects ever been vaccinated during lifetime. 
The PPS Immunogenicity used for the immunogenicity analyses consisted of 407 subjects, as 13 
subjects were excluded from the PPS Immunogenicity due to protocol deviations. 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Primary immunogenicity endpoint was assessed by HI and MN assays tested against H5N1 pandemic 
influenza strain in the total population and by age cohort prior to vaccination (Day 1), at 3 weeks after 
Assessment report  
Page 56/91 
 
 
  
 
first vaccination (Day 22) and at 3 weeks after second vaccination (Day 43) and measured by GMT, 
Day 22/Day 1 and Day 43/Day 1GMRs, as well as seroconversion rate.  
GMTs and GMRs for HI Titers (Day 1 to Day 43) 
Pre-vaccination (Day 1) HI GMT titers against the homologous H5/N1 pandemic influenza were very 
low in the overall study population across all 6 treatment arms (range: 5.00-5.24) and similar in both 
age cohorts.  
After first vaccine dose (Day 22), HI GMTs showed only minimal increase and Day 22/Day 1 GMRs that 
ranged from 1.11 to 1.29. Findings were comparable across vaccine arms and age cohorts (subjects 6 
months-<36 months of age: 1.05-1.30; subjects 36 months-<9 years of age: 1.08-1.29).  
At 3 weeks after second vaccine dose (Day 43), a robust immune response was observed with 
increased HI GMTs in all treatment arms and Day 43/Day 1 GMRs ranging from 13.77 to 24.98 and 
showing higher titers in subjects aged 6 months-<36 months (range, 18.27-31.39) in respect to 
subjects aged 36 months-<9 years (range, 9.83-23.34). Overall, these finding confirm that the 
licensed 2-dose regimen, with a second vaccine dose administered 3 weeks after the first, is essential 
to elicit an adequate antibody response.          
Day 43 GMT and Day 43/Day1 GMR increases were consistently higher in D, E, F arms characterized 
by 100% dose of MF59 content (ranging from 122.43 to 123.61 for GMTs and from 24.35 to 24.98 for 
GMRs) as compared to A, B, C arms conversely characterized by 50% of MF59 content (ranging from 
68.06 to 86.70 for GMTs and from 13.77 to 16.38 for GMRs), suggesting that antibody response is 
enhanced by the MF59 content (50%<100%). This finding was confirmed across age cohorts. 
Regards to antigen dose, no clear effect on immunogenicity is observed, with lower doses achieving 
similar antibody responses. In vaccine arms D, E, F with 100% MF59 content, HI GMTs at Day 43 
(122.43, 123.37, 123.61, respectively) and Day 43/Day 1 GMRs (24.35, 24.98, 23.14, respectively) 
did not show relevant differences by decreasing antigen dose. Instead results obtained by MN assay 
seem to show slightly lower immune responses for Arm D (Day 43 GMT 619.44, Day 43/Day 1 GMR 
119.78) compared to Arms E (Day 43 GMT 864.91, Day 43/Day 1 GMR 168.06) and F (Day 43 GMT 
766.18, Day 43/Day 1 GMR 144.55).      
Analysing GMT and GMRs results by age cohorts, as expected younger subjects (6-<36 months) in 
respect to the older age cohort (3 years -<9 years) seem to show better immunogenicity results, 
supporting the advantage of using the MF59-adjuvanted in priming an immune response in 
immunologically naive subjects, like young children.  
Percentage of subjects with HI seroconversion and percentage of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 (Day 1 to 
Day 43) 
As there were no differences between the percentage of subjects with seroconversion (non-detectable 
titer at D1 to ≥1:40, or 4-fold increase from a detectable Day 1 titer) and the percentage of subjects 
with HI titer ≥1:40 at Day 22 or Day 43 in the overall study population or either of the age cohorts, the 
results for these two study outcomes were overlapping and are presented only once. 
In the study population, the percentage of subjects with HI titer >1:40 at baseline (Day 1) was very 
low across all study arms (range, 0-1.5%) and only minimal increases were observed at Day 22 
(range, 0-4,5%). Results were consistent in the two age cohorts. At 3 weeks after second dose (Day 
43) percentage of subjects with seroconversion importantly increased reaching 74.6-90.9% of study 
population. Higher percentages were found in the younger age group (range, 79.4-93.9%) than in the 
older age group (range, 67.6-87.9%).  
Assessment report  
Page 57/91 
 
 
  
 
In line with what already described for GMTs and GMRs, when analysing data regarding MF59 content, 
lower seroconversion rates were observed in treatment arms A-C when compared to those recorded for 
treatment arms D-F, again confirming that 100% adjuvant content is relevant to boost immune 
response (Overall study population: arms A-C range, 74.6-82.1% versus arms D-F range, 86.6-
90.9%). 
MN test results 
Overall, MN assay test results are consistent with those obtained with the HI assay. However, higher 
antibody titers were observed confirming literature data suggesting the MN functional test (showing 
neutralizing antibody titres) to be a more sensitive than HI method for detection of antibodies to H5N1 
viruses.  
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints looked at persistence of immunological responses to the different 
vaccine formulations by comparing response as measured by HI and MN antibody titers on Day 202 
(i.e., 6 months after second vaccination). Analysis was carried out in the total population and by age 
cohort. 
At Day 202, HI and MN assays both showed GMTs and GMRs against the H5N1 pandemic influenza 
homologous strain that are decreased in respect to Day 43 for all vaccination groups. However, Day 
202/Day 1 GMRs were increased in respect to baseline and superior in the 100% MF59 vaccine groups 
(Arms D, E, F) than in the 50% MF59 groups (Arms A, B, C), suggesting that higher adjuvant content 
is associated with longer persistence of antibody response; this was confirmed when analysing data by 
age cohorts.  
The highest percentages of subjects with an antibody titre >1:40 (or seroconversion) at 6 months 
after second vaccine dose by both HI and MN assays was found in Arm F (HA antigen-adjuvant ratio 
7.5 μg/100% MF59) with, respectively, 25.4% and 98.5% of the study population. While in respect to 
Arm F, lower HI seroconversion rates were found in Arm D (15.2%), Arm E performed similarly 
(21.7%) in the overall population. Consistent differences across Arms D-F were reported for the two 
age cohorts, that however displayed a superior immune response in younger children (Arm D 27.1% 
versus Arm E 33.3% and Arm F 41.9%) than in older children (Arm D 3.0% versus Arm E 9.1% and 
Arm F 11.1%).  
Although there seems to be no clear difference in HI nor MN response at D202 between arms E 
(3.75ug/100% MF59) and F (7.5ug/100% MF59), the MAH concludes that the Day 202 immunogenicity 
results support the use of the formulation containing the higher MF59 content (100% MF59) in 
combination with the highest antigen dose (7.5 μg H5N1 HA) that was evaluated in Arm F, which 
corresponds to the current adult licensed formulation. An important caveat here is that the study 
included relatively small groups and was not designed to detect any differences between specific 
groups. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the results from study V87_30 indicate that Foclivia is immunogenic in children from 6 months 
to <9 years of age. However, the indication proposed by the MAH in 4.1 section of the SmPC 
(Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation in persons 6 months of age and 
older) cannot be agreed. As foreseen for pandemic preparedness vaccines (previously known as 
“mock-up” vaccines”), the general indication has been maintained to allow flexibility of use during a 
pandemic. This is in accordance with previous analogous procedures.  
Assessment report  
Page 58/91 
 
 
  
 
While after the first vaccine dose only minimal antibody responses are observed, increased titers are 
shown at 3 weeks after the second dose for all treatment arms, confirming that the 2-dose vaccine 
schedule is necessary to elicit immune response.  
Overall, subjects belonging to the younger age group (6–<36 months) displayed a higher immune 
response than older subjects (36 months-<9 years), suggesting that not-primed immune system in 
children enhances vaccine response.        
All immunogenicity data at three weeks and 6 months after second vaccine dose support that a 100% 
MF59 content is needed in the monovalent H5N1 pandemic preparedness vaccine to elicit an increased 
immunogenicity compared to that achieved with lower adjuvant content. This is confirmed across age 
cohorts.  
Regards to antigen dose, no clear effect on immunogenicity is observed, with lower doses achieving 
similar antibody responses, particularly Arm E and F. 
The highest percentages of subjects with an antibody titre >1:40 (or seroconversion) at 6 months 
after second vaccine dose by both HI and MN assays was found in Arm F (HA antigen-adjuvant ratio 
7.5 μg/100%) with 25.4% and 98.5%, respectively.  
In conclusion, all immunogenicity endpoints confirm that a higher adjuvant content is needed to elicit a 
greater antibody response across age cohorts. Among vaccine formulations with 100% MF59, the adult 
and half adult antigen dose showed similar antibody responses, while for the smaller antigen 
formulation a trend towards lower immune responses were reported. Therefore, in principle the 
proposed dose for the paediatric population, that is the same as for adults (7.5 µg+100% MF59), 
sounds reasonable. This is also supported by results from study V87_P6 in children 6 months to 17 
years of age and by Focetria that was approved and used with the same antigen-adjuvant adult dose 
as Foclivia both in adult and paediatric populations. However, according to SmPC guideline, section 5.1 
also mentions immunogenic results from half adult antigen dose showing a comparable elicited 
antibody response vs full antigen dose. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The Safety profile of Foclivia in paediatric population comes from a dose-ranging paediatric study 
(V87_30) completed for aH5N1 in subjects 6 months through <9 years of age. 
Study V87_30 was a Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicentre study evaluating the 
immunogenicity and safety of 6 aH5N1 vaccine formulations in healthy children aged 6 months to <9 
years. 
A total of 420 subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 6 
vaccine groups. 
Solicited reactogenicity was recorded for 7 consecutive days (Day 1 through Day 7 and Day 22 through 
Day 28). Within this period, events were to be collected by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)/caregiver in 
a study specific daily Diary Card. All unsolicited AEs were collected during the treatment period (Day 1 
through Day 43); and serious AEs (SAEs), new onset of chronic disease (NOCD), AEs leading to 
vaccine and/or study withdrawal, AEs of special interest (AESIs), and associated 
medications/vaccinations were collected during the follow-up period (Day 44 through Day 202).

Patient exposure 
The number of subjects included in each safety analysis set is shown in table below. 
No subjects were excluded from the safety sets. All of the 420 subjects in the All Exposed Set had 
solicited and unsolicited AE data, and were therefore included in the Solicited Safety Set, Unsolicited 
Safety Set, and Overall Safety Set. In each of the safety sets, there were 210 subjects in both the 6 
months to <36 months age cohort and the 3 years to <9 years age cohort. 
Table 17: Overview of Safety Sets Analysed – As Treated – All Exposed Set 
The evaluation of the safety profile of Foclivia in paediatric population aged 6 months to <9 years is 
based upon a dose-ranging paediatric study (V87_30) completed for H5N1, in which 420 subjects were 
enrolled in the study. A total of 210 subjects were exposed in each of the safety set in both the 6 
months to <36 months age cohort and the 3 years to <9 years age cohort and had solicited and 
unsolicited AE.  
Considering that only 70 subjects received the adult dose (7.5 μg/100%), the one finally chosen also 
for children, the safety database of paediatric study V87_30 is considered small, limiting the detection 
of rare AEs. However, the safety profile of Foclivia in children is known also from study V87P6, which is 
of reassurance, even if pooled data would have been more informative in this population.  Information 
on specific longer-term, and rare and very rare AEs, such as the risk of narcolepsy or Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, should be evaluated post-licensure, also according to Guideline on Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014).

Adverse events  
A summary of the solicited AEs reported in the Solicited Safety Set is presented for the overall study 
population and by age cohort in table below.

After Vaccination, Overall and by Age Cohort – As Treated – Solicited Safety Set 
Assessment report  
Page 61/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Solicited local and systemic reactions from day 1 through day 7 in the overall study population appear 
to be similar among different H5N1 HA antigen doses and increasing MF59.  Moreover, it was noted 
that the number of subjects with solicited AEs tended to be lower in percentage after vaccination 2 
compared to vaccination 1 in each study arm (any AE reported from total population decreased from 
39% to 28.6%) 
Some differences were noted between subjects with age cohorts of 6 months to <36 months and 3 
years to <9 years. In particular the percentages of subjects developing solicited systemic AEs were 
reported in higher percentage in subjects in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort (42.9%) 
compared to those in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort (21.9%), without important differences 
among different arms. 
Solicited local adverse events 
Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age 
A summary of solicited local AEs occurring within 7 days after vaccination in the Solicited Safety Set is 
presented for the 6 months to <36 months age cohort in Table 19 below. For subjects 6 months to 
<36 months of age, solicited local AEs included injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, 
injection-site ecchymosis, and injection-site tenderness.

Table 19: Number (%) of Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age With Solicited Local 
Adverse Events from Day 1 Through Day 7 After Vaccination – As Treated – Solicited Safety 
Set 
The rates of solicited local AEs occurring within 7 days after any vaccination were overall similar 
between the 6 vaccine groups in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort. Tenderness was the most 
frequently reported solicited local AE, with rates ranging from 11.8% to 22.9% across the 6 vaccine 
groups, followed by erythema that occurred in 5.7 and 5.9% of subjects in Arm A and F, respectively, 
and above 8% in the other arms. 
Assessment report  
Page 63/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Severe events were reported only for tenderness. Five subjects across 3 vaccine groups reported 
severe tenderness, which did not persist beyond 3 days after vaccination, as reported by the MAH.  
Subjects 3 Years to <9 Years of Age 
A summary of solicited local AEs occurring within 7 days after vaccination in the Solicited Safety Set is 
presented for the 3 years to <9 years age cohort in Table below. For subjects 3 years to <9 years of 
age, solicited local AEs included injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, injection-site 
ecchymosis, and injection-site pain.

Events from Day 1 Through Day 7 After Vaccination – As Treated – Solicited Safety Set 
Assessment report  
Page 64/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE, with 
rates ranging from 13.5% to 36.1% across the 6 vaccine groups. The rates of solicited local AEs were 
similar between the 6 vaccine groups and the majority were mild or moderate in intensity. One subject 
reported severe induration and 3 subjects across 3 vaccine groups reported severe pain. However, 
they seem not to be correlated to the higher adjuvant content. 
Solicited Systemic Adverse Events 
Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age 
A summary of solicited systemic AEs occurring within 7 days after vaccination in the Solicited Safety 
Set is presented for the 6 months to <36 months age cohort in Table 7. For subjects 6 months to <36 
months of age, solicited systemic AEs included change in eating habits, vomiting, diarrhoea, irritability, 
sleepiness, shivering/chills, and fever. 
Table 21: Number (%) of Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age With Solicited Systemic 
Adverse Events from Day 1 Through Day 7 After Vaccination – As Treated – Solicited Safety 
Set 
Assessment report  
Page 65/91 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In the 6 months to <36 months age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after 
any vaccination were diarrhoea (11.1% to 28.6%), irritability (11.4% to 27.8%), and sleepiness (8.8% 
to 25.7%), with few severe events reported. There does not appear to be a trend in frequency of AEs 
with the increase of H5N1 HA antigen dose and/or MF59 content.  
Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after any vaccination in about 14% of subjects in each vaccine group 
except in the Arm E (3.75 µg/100%) in which occurred in only one subject (2.8%), maybe due to 
Assessment report

chance. No subjects had severe fever (≥40.0°C). Overall, the frequencies of diarrhoea and sleepiness 
seem to decrease from vaccination 1 to vaccination 2 in almost all subgroups. No important differences 
were noted from vaccination 1 to 2 in the other AEs among subgroups. 
Subjects 3 Years to <9 Years of Age 
A summary of solicited systemic AEs occurring within 7 days after vaccination in the Solicited Safety 
Set is presented for the 3 years to <9 years age cohort in Table 8. For subjects 3 years to <9 years of 
age, solicited systemic AEs included loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia, headache, malaise, shivering/chills, and fever.

In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after any 
vaccination were fatigue (2.9% to 18.2%) and headache (5.4% to 11.1%) with few severe events 
reported. The AEs seem to be similar between the groups and without apparent higher rates or 
severity with the increase of the antigen dose or MF59 content. 
Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after any vaccination by 2.8% to 10.8% of subjects in the 6 vaccine 
groups. 
It was noted that some solicited systemic AEs such as diarrhoea and fever are more common in the 
younger population (6 months to < 36 months) than in subjects 3 years to < 9 years. 
Other Indicators of Reactogenicity 
Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age 
After Any Vaccination 
In all 6 vaccine groups in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort, the majority of subjects recorded 
body temperature <38.0°C within the 7 days after any vaccination. Low numbers of subjects reported

body temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C. No subjects reported a body temperature of 
≥40.0°C. The proportions of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination 
were low, ranging from 2.9% to 11.4% for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 5.6% to 14.7% 
for treatment of pain and/or fever. 
After Vaccination 1 
After Vaccination 1, few subjects in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort reported body 
temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C. No subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. 
The proportions of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination ranged 
from 0% to 5.9% for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 2.9% to 11.8% for treatment of pain 
and/or fever. 
After Vaccination 2 
After Vaccination 2, few subjects in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort reported body 
temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C (Table 9). No subjects reported a body temperature of 
≥40.0°C. 
The proportions of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination ranged 
from 2.9% to 8.6% for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 2.8% to 8.6% for treatment of pain 
and/or fever.

Subjects 3 Years to <9 Years of Age 
After Any Vaccination 
In all 6 vaccine groups in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort, the majority of subjects recorded body 
temperature <38.0°C within the 7 days after any vaccination. Low numbers of subjects reported body 
temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C. No subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. 
The proportions of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination were low, 
ranging from 3.0% to 8.8% for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 0% to 8.8% for treatment of 
pain and/or fever. 
After Vaccination 1 
After Vaccination 1, few subjects in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort reported body temperature in 
the range of 38.0 °C to 39.9 °C. No subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. 
The proportions of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination ranged 
from 0% to 8.8% for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 0% to 8.8% for treatment of pain 
and/or fever. 
After Vaccination 2 
After Vaccination 2, few subjects in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort reported body temperature in 
the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C. No subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. The proportions 
of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics within 7 days after any vaccination ranged from 0% to 3.0% 
for prevention of pain and/or fever and from 0% to 6.1% for treatment of pain and/or fever.

Table 24: Number (%) of Subjects 3 Years to <9 Years of Age With Other Solicited Adverse 
Events from Day 1 Through Day 7 After Vaccination – As Treated – Solicited Safety Set 
The majority of subjects recorded body temperature <38.0°C within the 7 days after any vaccination. 
Overall, low numbers of subjects reported body temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C and no 
subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. However, if considering younger children (6 Months 
to <36 Months), a slightly higher rate of Other Solicited AEs (Body temperature >38.5-38.9 °C) after 
any vaccination was noted in Arm F (11.8%) compared to other treatment arms (arm E: 2.8%, D: 
8.6%),  but only after vaccination 1. Also, the analgesic/antipyretic treatment use seems to be higher 
in arm F (14.7%) vs arm E (5.6%) and D (8.6%).

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Subjects 6 Months to <9 Years of Age 
In the overall study population, the proportion of subjects reporting any unsolicited AE was comparable 
between the 6 vaccine groups, ranging from 14.3% to 28.6%. Across the 6 vaccine groups, unsolicited 
AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of “Infections and infestations”. The most commonly 
reported unsolicited AEs in the overall study population were upper respiratory tract infection (29/420 
subjects, 6.9%), gastroenteritis (8/420 subjects, 1.9%), rhinitis (8/420 subjects, 1.9%), and 
nasopharyngitis (7/420 subjects, 1.7%). 
Subjects 6 Months to <36 Months of Age 
In the 6 months to <36 months age cohort, the proportion of subjects reporting any unsolicited AEs 
was comparable between the 6 vaccine groups, ranging from 20.6% to 37.1%. 
Unsolicited AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of “Infections and infestations”. Upper 
respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE, reported in 2.9% to 20.0% 
of subjects across the 6 vaccine groups. 
Subjects 3 Years to <9 Years of Age 
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort, the proportion of subjects reporting any unsolicited AE was 
comparable between the 6 vaccine groups, ranging from 5.7% to 21.2%. Unsolicited AEs were most 
commonly reported in the SOC of “Infections and infestations”. Upper respiratory tract infection was 
the most commonly reported unsolicited AE, reported in 0% to 9.1% of subjects across the 6 vaccine 
groups. The rates of related unsolicited AEs were low across the 6 vaccine groups in the 3 years to <9 
years age cohort, ranging from 0% to 3.0%. The rates of unsolicited AEs tended to be lower in the 3 
years to <9 years age cohort (5.7% to 21.2%) than the vaccine groups in the 6 months to <36 
months age cohort (20.6% to 37.1%).

After Vaccination, Overall and by Age Cohort, by System Organ Class and Preferred Term –

Assessment report

The rates of any unsolicited AEs in the overall population (subjects 6 Months to <9 Years of Age) 
within 21 days after vaccination were similar in the different arms without a particular trend and 
ranging from 14.3% to 28.6%. The most common AEs by SOC were infections and infestations (from 
8.6% to 23.2%) mainly driven by upper respiratory tract infection followed by gastroenteritis. Cough 
was reported in 2 subjects in the age cohort 6-36 months administered with 3.75 ug/50% Adj. 
Moreover, a higher rate of any unsolicited AEs was observed in younger children (20.6% to 37.1%) 
compared to the 3 years to <9 Years of age group (5.7% to 21.2%) which could be of concern. 
However, if we look at the related unsolicited AEs, even if again more frequent in the younger age 
group, the range of frequencies decreased and were from 0% to 2.9% in the overall population. There 
did not appear to be a pattern of related unsolicited AEs associated with the H5N1 HA or MF59 content 
of the vaccine formulations. Some unsolicited ADRs such as gastroenteritis and bronchial 
hyperreactivity which occurred in no more than one subject per group, were not included in SmPC 
section 4.8, since biological implausibility did not allow to conclude on a causal relationship. Urticaria 
was considered as related AE (frequency Uncommon) since already characterised and previously listed 
in the post-marketing section of the Foclivia SmPC referred to experience with H1N1v (licensed for use 
from 6 months of age during the 2009 influenza pandemic, and containing the same MF59 adjuvant 
and manufactured with the same process as Foclivia). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
In the overall study population, 8 of 420 subjects (1.9%) reported 12 SAEs during the study, most 
commonly in the SOC of “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications”, with 4 subjects reporting an 
SAE of “animal bite”. The proportion of subjects reporting SAEs was low across the 6 vaccine groups, 
ranging from 0% to 4.3%. None of the SAEs were assessed as related to the study vaccine. 
In the 6 months to <36 months age cohort, 5 of 210 subjects (2.4%) reported 9 SAEs; in the 3 years 
to <9 years age cohort, 3 of 210 subjects (1.4%) reported 3 SAEs. 
Assessment report  
Page 74/91 
 
 
  
 
 
There was 1 unsolicited AE leading to death in the study. The subject (in the 6 months to <36 months 
age cohort in Arm B) had an SAE of brain neoplasm with a fatal outcome, which was assessed by the 
Investigator and Sponsor as not related to the study vaccine. 
The overall incidence of SAEs was low, with 8 of 420 subjects (1.9%) reporting SAEs, none of which 
were considered related to the study vaccine.  
Deaths 
In the overall study population, there was 1 death reported during the study, due to an AE assessed as 
not related to the study vaccine. 
One subject in Arm B (3.75 μg of HA antigen and 0.125 mL [50%] of MF59) (Subject 60803-022), 
aged 34 months at the time of enrolment in the study, had an SAE of brain neoplasm (onset: Study 
Day 222) with a fatal outcome (Study Day 377). This subject also experienced SAEs of Klebsiella 
pneumoniae bacteraemia (2 events: onset/resolution of first event: Study Day 234/Study Day 254; 
onset/resolution of second event: Study Day 259/Study Day 271) and septic shock (onset/resolution: 
Study Day 259/Study Day 262). The Investigator and Sponsor assessed the 4 SAEs as not related to 
the study vaccine. 
Two cases of febrile convulsion were reported in two children aged 6 months to < 36 months as SAEs 
in the two formulations with higher antigen H5N1 HA ad MF59 content. These events were assessed as 
not related to the study vaccine due to implausible temporal relationship and/or alternative cause. 
However, cases of convulsions with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with 
Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia, therefore,  this information 
is included in 4.4 section of the SmPC. It is also noted in the SmPC that the majority of febrile 
convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects and were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy.  
Laboratory findings 
No safety-related clinical laboratory data were collected in Study V87_30. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
All clinically relevant changes in physical findings or vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure 
were to have been reported as unsolicited AEs during the study and were not collected separately.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Safety analyses stratified by age (3 months to <36 months versus 3 years to <9 years of age) are 
presented in the previous sections. No other analyses of intrinsic factors were undertaken.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
All 420 subjects enrolled in study V87_30 were included in the Solicited Safety Set, Unsolicited Safety 
Set, and Overall Safety Set, in each of which there were 210 subjects in both the 6 months to <36 
months age cohort and the 3 years to <9 years age cohort. 
Considering that only 70 subjects received the adult dose (7.5 μg/100%), the one proposed by the 
MAH also for children, the safety database of paediatric study V87_30 is considered small, limiting the 
detection of the rare AEs. However, the safety profile of Foclivia in children is known also from study 
V87P6, which is of reassurance, even if pooled data would have been more informative in this 
population.  Information on specific longer-term, and rare and very rare adverse events, such as the 
risk of narcolepsy or Guillain-Barré syndrome, should be evaluated post-licensure, also according to 
Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014).  
Overall, solicited local and systemic reactions from day 1 through day 7, in the 6 months to <9 years 
study population appear to be similar among different H5N1 HA antigen doses and increasing MF59 
content. It was noted that the number of subjects with solicited AEs tended to be lower in percentage 
after vaccination 2 compared to vaccination 1 in each study arm (any AE reported from total 
population decreased from 39% to 28.6%). 
Some differences were noted between subjects with age cohorts of 6 months to <36 months and 3 
years to <9 years. In particular, the percentages of subjects developing solicited systemic AEs were 
reported in higher percentage in subjects in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort (42.9%) 
compared to those in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort (21.9%) without important differences 
among different arms. 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were re-arranged in a single table in SmPC section 4.8 relevant for 
adults, elderly and paediatric subjects, including solicited and unsolicited related AEs. 
Solicited local AEs  
The rates of solicited local AEs occurring within 7 days after any vaccination were overall similar 
between the 6 vaccine groups in the 6 months to <36 months age cohort with injection-site 
tenderness being the most frequently reported solicited local AE (rates ranging from 11.8% to 22.9% 
across the 6 vaccine groups) followed by injection-site erythema that occurred in 5,7 and 5.9% of 
subjects in Arm A and F, respectively, and above 8% in the other arms. Few severe events were 
reported only for tenderness (five subjects across 3 vaccine groups), which did not persist beyond 3 
days after vaccination, as reported by the MAH. 
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort, injection-site pain was the most frequently reported solicited 
local AE, with rates ranging from 13.5% to 36.1% across the 6 vaccine groups. The rates of solicited 
local AEs were similar between the 6 vaccine groups and the majority were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One subject reported severe injection-site induration and 3 subjects across 3 vaccine groups 
reported severe injection-site pain. However, they seem not to be correlated to the higher antigen 
dose nor adjuvant content.

Solicited systemic AEs 
In the 6 months to <36 months age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after 
any vaccination were diarrhoea (11.1% to 28.6%), irritability (11.4% to 27.8%), and sleepiness (8.8% 
to 25.7%), with few severe events reported. There does not appear to be a trend in frequency of AEs 
with the increase of H5N1 HA antigen dose and/or MF59 content. Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after 
any vaccination in about 14% of subjects in each vaccine group except in the Arm E (3.75 µg/100%) 
in which occurred in only one subject (2.8%), maybe due to chance. No subjects had severe fever (≥
40.0°C). Overall, the frequencies of diarrhoea and sleepiness seem to decrease from vaccination 1 to 
vaccination 2 in almost all subgroups. No important differences were noted from vaccination 1 to 2 in 
the other AEs among subgroups. 
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after any 
vaccination were fatigue (2.9% to 18.2%) and headache (5.4% to 11.1%) with few severe events 
reported. The AEs seem to be similar between the groups and without apparent higher rates or 
severity with the increase of the antigen dose or MF59 content. Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after 
any vaccination by 2.8% to 10.8% of subjects in the 6 vaccine groups. 
It was noted that some solicited systemic AEs such as diarrhoea and fever are more common in the 
younger population (6 months to < 36 months) than in subjects 3 years to < 9 years. 
The majority of subjects recorded body temperature <38.0°C within the 7 days after any vaccination 
with low numbers of subjects reported body temperature in the range of 38.0°C to 39.9°C and no 
subjects reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. A slightly higher rate of Other Solicited AEs (Body 
temperature >38 °C) was noted in younger children (6 Months to <36 Months) in Arm F compared to 
other treatment arms, in particular after vaccination 1, together with a greater analgesic/antipyretic 
use. 
Unsolicited AEs 
The rates of any unsolicited AEs in the overall population within 21 days after vaccination were similar 
in the different arm without a particular trend and ranging from 14.3% to 28.6%. A higher rate of any 
unsolicited AEs was observed in younger children (20.6% to 37.1%) compared to the 3 years to <9 
Years of age group (5.7% to 21.2%) which could be of concern. However, if we look at the related 
unsolicited AEs, the range of frequencies, even if again slightly higher in the younger age group, 
decreased and become from 0% to 2.9% (in the overall population).  
Among the unsolicited AEs gastroenteritis, bronchial hyperreactivity, upper respiratory tract infection 
and cough were not considered related to aH5N1 vaccination due to no biological plausibility, although 
temporal association was observed.  
Cough is retained in the post-marketing experience section of Foclivia SmPC (section 4.8), regarding 
Focetria (H1N1) vaccine, while urticaria was moved from Focetria post-marketing section of Foclivia 
SmPC ADRs table in section 4.8, since considered related to aH5N1 vaccination, according to data from 
pediatric study V87_30. 
A low number of SAEs were reported in the overall safety population. 1.9% of subjects reported 12 
SAEs during the study, most commonly in the SOC of “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications”, 
with 4 subjects reporting an SAE of “animal bite”. All SAEs were assessed as unrelated to the study 
vaccine by the investigator. One death in Arm B (3.75 μg of HA antigen and 0.125 mL [50%] of MF59) 
occurred due to brain neoplasm, not related to the study vaccine. 
Two cases of febrile convulsions occurred in two children aged 6 months to < 36 months and reported 
as SAEs, no other cases of seizures have been reported in this trial. However, these events of febrile 
Assessment report  
Page 77/91 
 
 
  
 
convulsions were judged as not related to the study vaccine due to implausible temporal relationship 
and/or alternative cause.  
Cases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an 
MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia, and this information is included in 4.4 
section of the SmPC. It is also noted in the SmPC that the majority of febrile convulsions occurred in 
paediatric subjects and were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy.  
In total, 1 subject in Arm B reported an AE leading to NOCD (asthma) during the study. No subjects 
reported AESIs or AEs leading to vaccine and/or study withdrawal. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Foclivia in the paediatric population from Study V87_30 is similar to that known 
from StudyV97P6. Overall, solicited local and systemic reactions from day 1 through day 7 appear to 
be similar among different H5N1 HA antigen doses and increasing MF59 content. However, it may be 
that the sample size was too small and the population too variable to detect any dose effect. The 
number of subjects with solicited AEs tended to be lower after vaccination 2 than after vaccination 1 in 
each study arm. Moreover, solicited systemic AEs seem to occur more frequently in younger children 
(aged 6 months to < 36 months) compared to those in the 3 years to <9 years age cohort. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.11 is acceptable. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.11. 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP with proposed amendments mainly reflecting the results of the 
V87_30 clinical study and the safety data in the paediatric population. This paediatric dose-ranging 
study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of six aH5N1 vaccine formulations (3 
amounts of H5N1 HA antigen in combination with 2 dosages of MF59 adjuvant), administered as 2 
vaccinations given 3 weeks apart in subjects 6 months through <9 years of age (420 subjects). The 
main proposed RMP changes were the following: 
• 
• 
Inclusion of V87_30 data in the clinical exposure sections 
Inclusion of indication and posology for children 6 months to less than 18 years of age in the 
product overview for Foclivia; 
•  Removal of missing information: Use in children (6 months to less than 18 years of age) from 
the list of the safety concerns.

Safety Specification 
Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
Minor revisions to the PART II. MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND TARGET 
POPULATION(S) were proposed by the MAH and agreed. 
Clinical trial exposure 
The estimated subject exposure in completed clinical studies, the tested dose combinations and 
formulations have been updated in the text and the tables in order to include data from V87_30 study.  
Populations not studied in clinical trials 
The section has been updated by adjusting exposure data to the current available data and reviewing 
the limitations with respect to exposure in special populations. In particular the section related to the 
“Limitations in respect to populations typically under-represented in clinical trial development 
programmes” has been revised to bring up to date the knowledge on the vaccine use in children 
according to the results from V87_30 study. The MAH states that “there is no indication that the safety 
profile of aH5N1 influenza vaccine in the paediatric population (6 months to less than 18 years) differs 
from the adult and elderly populations characterised so far. No safety concerns have been identified 
form the paediatric population.” Based on available data, the use in children of this vaccine is no longer 
considered a safety concern (missing information).  
Post-authorisation experience 
The section has been updated to current available data. Aflunov is largely sold to government parties 
for stockpile purposes and no doses were sold to the open market. No doses of Aflunov or Foclivia 
were administered to patients.

Identified and potential risks 
No modification to the identified and potential risks has been proposed by the MAH with respect to the 
previous version 4.0 of the RMP, approved within the procedure EMEA/H/C/001208/WS2151/0068 on 
05 May 2022.  
Concerning the Use in children (6 moths to less than 18 years of age), previously classified as missing 
information was proposed to be removed by the MAH and agreed.   
Missing information  
Use in children (6 moths to less than 18 years of age) previously classified as missing information was 
proposed to be removed by the MAH.  
Seqirus conducted a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety in healthy children 6 months to <9 years of age of six different 
vaccine formulations including either 1.875, 3.75, or 7.5 μg HA of H5N1 influenza strain combined 
with either 0.125 mL or 0.25 mL MF59, in two IM injections administered three weeks apart 
(V87_30). The study was a post-authorisation commitment in Europe, as agreed in the 
paediatric investigational plan (PIP) with EMA/Paediatric Committee (Aflunov: EMEA-000599- PIP01-
09- M07, Foclivia: EMEA-001830-PIP01-15-M02). The purpose of this study was to provide 
additional clinical data on aH5N1 vaccine in children in anticipation of an avian influenza pandemic. In 
total 420 paediatric subjects were included in the study, 210 subjects each in the 6 months to <36 
months age cohort and the 3 years to <9 years age cohort. 
The rates of solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) within seven days following 
each vaccination were comparable across the six vaccine groups in both the 6 months to <36 
months and 3 years to <9 years age cohorts. The vaccine formulations with higher MF59 content, 
including the formulation with the highest H5N1 HA antigen dose, were not associated with 
increased reactogenicity. Across age cohorts and vaccine formulations, the majority of solicited local 
and systemic AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, with few severe events reported. Most 
solicited local and systemic AEs had an onset close to vaccination and were of short duration. No 
subjects reported severe fever during the study. 
The rates of unsolicited AEs reported in the 21 days following any vaccination were 
comparable between the six vaccine groups. The majority of unsolicited AEs were mild in intensity and 
not related to the study vaccine. 
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was low; no SAE was assessed as related to the study 
vaccine. One subject reported an AE (asthma) leading to new onset of chronic disease; no 
subjects reported AESIs or AEs leading to vaccine and/or study withdrawal. 
During the study, 1 death was reported due to an AE. The subject (in the 6 months to <36 months age 
cohort in Arm B) had an SAE of brain neoplasm with a fatal outcome, which was assessed by the 
Investigator and the Sponsor as not related to the study vaccine. 
In conclusion, the six aH5N1 vaccine formulations were well tolerated and had comparable 
and acceptable reactogenicity and safety profiles in the study population. No new significant 
safety information was generated from this study. 
After completion of the V87_30 study combined with the results from the previously 
conducted paediatric study with aH5N1 (V87P6), MAH considered that the safety of aH5N1 vaccine 
in paediatric population (6 months to less than 18 years of age) has been characterised and is 
no longer considered missing information. No new important identified or potential risks or 
safety concerns were identified from the study. 
Assessment report  
Page 80/91 
 
 
  
 
The study V87_30 was conducted in order to address the missing area of information related to the 
use of aH5N1 influenza vaccine in children. Data from this study does not raise safety concerns in this 
special population and the safety profile was similar to that observed in adult and elderly people.  
Since the RMP is a common document for Foclivia and Aflunov vaccines, the need to maintain such 
missing information in the list of safety concerns for Aflunov only has been evaluated.  Considering 
that the authorised indication of Aflunov vaccine concerns the adult population and a PIP is in place for 
this vaccine, the missing information “Use in children (6 months to less than 18 years of age)” is not 
applicable according to GVP guidelines. Based on the above, the deletion of this missing information is 
applicable to the common list of safety concerns. 
Therefore, the removal of “Use in children (6 months to less than 18 years of age)” from the list of 
safety concerns as missing information is acceptable. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
The Pharmacovigilance plan has been updated according to the completion of the study V87_30. The 
study was included in the previous version of the RMP among the Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities not required by regulators. Therefore, reference to this study has been removed form text 
and table III.3.1.  
The modification proposed to the pharmacovigilance plan is acknowledged.  
The MAH was asked to introduce some amendments in the RMP to correctly reflect obligation in Annex 
II of the PI for Foclivia and to ensure adherence to RMP guidance. 
The plan for additional pharmacovigilance activities was requested to be revised in accordance with 
Annex II conditions concerning the planned enhanced (active) safety surveillance consisting in a PASS 
imposed by the competent authority as a Specific Obligations in the context of marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances. Therefore, this study should be categorised as cat 2 study. Timelines 
foresees that, in case of pandemic, a protocol designed with appropriate size and potency, with specific 
reference to the different age classes and special populations should be submitted for evaluation in line 
with EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014 Guidance on Influenza Vaccines.  
Furthermore, the V87_27OB study, a post-marketing observational cohort safety study of pandemic 
influenza A/H5N1** vaccine (Foclivia) in pregnant women should be reported as category 3 study 
since required to address the missing information “Use in pregnancy”. 
Information in Table Part III.3.1: On-going and planned additional pharmacovigilance activities should 
reflect the format and structure in line with Guidance EMA/164014/2018 Rev.2.0.1 accompanying GVP 
Module V Rev.2.

In the updated version of the RMP, the Table Part III.3.1 has been revised and agreed as follows: 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product.  
The studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of 
the risk minimisation measures. 
PLANS FOR POST-AUTHORISATION EFFICACY STUDIES 
This Part of RMP reports the planned non-interventional study of vaccine effectiveness for Foclivia, to 
be conducted in the case of a pandemic, in accordance with the Guideline on Influenza vaccine 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
Of note, the planned post-authorisation efficacy study was imposed by the competent authority as a 
Specific Obligations in the context of marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. 
The structure and the content of the information reported are in line with Guidance EMA/164014/2018 
Rev.2.0.1 accompanying GVP Module V Rev.2. 
The MAH was requested to revise this Part of RMP in accordance with Annex II conditions.

Furthermore, the routine risk minimisation activities have been updated for Immune 
thrombocytopenia. This safety concern has no activities planned since it has been included as a 
potential safety concern based on pharmacological class effects. No modifications to PI have been 
proposed with regard to this safety concern. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP do not require further revision before the conclusion of 
the procedure. 
Annexes 
The MAH submitted a revised version 4.11 of the RMP with annexes in line with GVP guidance. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
No changes are made to the Opinion Annex II conditions.  However, reference to the specific obligation 
set for in Annex II – E has been amended to introduce the obligation of conducting an Enhanced 
(Active) Safety Surveillance in turn of a prospective cohort study. This amendment follows the terms 
already agreed in the context of the EMEA/H/C/WS2151 procedure submitted by the MAH in order to 
revise RMP according to criteria in GVP Module V rev.2. 
The proposal is considered acceptable since in line with EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014 Guidance. 
As a consequence of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Other 
minor changes have been included in the PI (see attachment). The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. Alignment with the current QRD template version v. 10.3 is ensured. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC 
Posology 
Adults and elderly (18 years of age and above): 0.5 ml at an elected date. 
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. 
Individuals 6 months of age and older: administer two doses (0.5 ml each), 21 days apart. 
Foclivia was evaluated in adults (aged 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following 
a 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. 
Data on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available in children aged less than 6 months.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet was submitted by the MAH and was found acceptable for the following reasons: 
As part of the present type II variation, the Foclivia SmPC has been updated to include the results of 
Study V87_30, provide more details on the other paediatric (Study V87P6), which was already 
described in the SmPC, and a few additional changes to further increase alignment within the 
document. The Foclivia PL has been updated in accordance with the changes in the SmPC and to 
increase alignment with the QRD template v.10.3.  
The primary changes in the PL consist of the addition of more detailed nonserious adverse reaction 
terms from the paediatric studies (V87P6 and V87_30) and a minor rearrangement of information in 
section 4, Possible side effects, to present the side effects in decreasing order of seriousness. There 
are no changes to Contraindications, Warnings and precautions, Interactions, Pregnancy and breast-
feeding or how the product is given (posology, dosage or method of administration). 
Since none of the changes to the PL described above affect the safety profile, impact key safety 
information or how the product is used, conducting new consultation with target patient groups is not 
required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is characterised by the occurrence of frequent, unpredictable epidemics, and much less 
frequent, worldwide pandemics. Influenza pandemic occurs when a novel influenza virus emerges 
against which the vast majority of the world’s population has no immunity. If such a virus 
demonstrates the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person, the result is a global outbreak of 
disease that affects a high percentage of individuals in a short period of time and is likely to cause 
substantially increased morbidity and mortality in all countries of the world. 
Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks of influenza, as the latter are caused by subtypes of 
influenza viruses that are already circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new 
subtypes or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time.  
Influenza pandemics are unpredictable and occur infrequently but have consequences on human health 
and economic well-being (WHO, 2017). Previous experience with the 2009 swine-origin influenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic showed that children were the most affected age category (Jain, 2009; Miller, 
2010), probably due to higher exposure in schools or the lack of pre-existing immunity as seen in the 
elderly, who have likely encountered the virus earlier in life (Cobey, 2017). 
Preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the last century witnessed three influenza pandemics, the 
"Spanish Flu" in 1918–1919, the "Asian Flu" in 1957 and the "Hong Kong Flu" in 1968 [Kilbourne, 
2006], all arising from avian influenza viruses. 
Assessment report  
Page 85/91 
 
 
  
 
Avian influenza viruses have several subtypes, but highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, 
have been associated with hundreds of identified human cases since 1997. Between 2003 and July 18, 
2018, 860 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus infection were officially reported to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) from 16 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, America and the Near 
East, with an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 53% [WHO, 2018]. 
Almost all of these cases have been epidemiologically linked to close contact with poultry, and while 
human-to-human transmission has been sporadic, H5N1 HPAI viruses represent a pandemic threat. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the event of an influenza pandemic, vaccines are the most effective means of preventing and 
controlling the spread of influenza in the human population.  
Foclivia is a monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, egg-derived, 
adjuvanted with MF59, manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for a 
centralised authorised seasonal influenza vaccine “Fluad Tetra” and a nationally authorised seasonal 
Influenza vaccine “Fluad”, a trivalent influenza vaccine licensed in several EU countries through a 
Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP). Four pandemic preparedness vaccines are currently authorised in 
the EU, which can be modified into pandemic influenza vaccines in a future pandemic. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical trial supporting dosing regimens in children aged 6 months to <9 years was Study V87_30, 
a phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicenter study aimed at evaluating the immunogenicity and 
safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant content in a monovalent H5N1 pandemic 
influenza vaccine in healthy paediatric subjects 6 months to <9 years of age. 
Eligible subjects were stratified by age at the time of enrollment into one of two age cohorts: 6 months 
to <36 months of age and 3 years to <9 years of age and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of 6 
vaccine groups. 
Subjects in each vaccine group were scheduled to receive 2 injections of the assigned aH5N1 vaccine 
formulation 3 weeks apart. 
In this study, the 5 vaccine formulations with decreased content of HA antigen and/or MF59 adjuvant 
(Arms A to E) were evaluated together with the formulation containing the licensed dosage for adults 
of 7.5 μg H5N1 HA antigen in combination with 0.25 mL (100%) MF59 (Arm F). 
Immunogenicity data in children 6 months to 17 years of age were also available from study V87_P6 in 
which Foclivia was administered with the same antigen-adjuvant adult dose. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In respect to pre-vaccination status, immune responses by HI and MN assay at 3 weeks after second 
vaccine dose (Day 43) show for all treatment arms and age cohorts increased GMTs, Day 43/Day 1 
GMRs from 13.77 to 24.98, and seroconversion rates between 74.6-90.9%.  
As after the first vaccine dose only minimal antibody responses are observed, Day 43 findings confirm 
that the licensed 2-dose regimen, with a second vaccine dose administered 3 weeks after the first, is 
essential to elicit antibody response.          
Assessment report  
Page 86/91 
 
 
  
 
All immunogenicity data at three weeks after second vaccine dose as well as persistence of antibody 
response at 6 months support that a 100% MF59 content is needed in the monovalent H5N1 pandemic 
preparedness vaccine to elicit a greater immunogenicity compared to that achieved with lower 
adjuvant content. This is confirmed across age cohorts and regardless of H5N1 HA antigen dose.  
The percentages of subjects with HI and MN titre >1:40 at 6 months after second vaccine dose by 
both HI and MN assays in Arm F (HA antigen-adjuvant ratio 7.5 μg/100%) was 25.4% and 98.5%, 
respectively.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No efficacy or effectiveness data are available for Foclivia. Presently, as expected for pandemic 
preparedness vaccines, the 2-dose vaccine regimen is evaluated based on immunogenicity data. 
As immunocompromised children were excluded from studies, generalizability of results to this 
population is not possible.   
Little is known on persistence of antibody response and no data are provided on booster dose in 
children.  
Although immunological assessment of influenza vaccines is commonly carried out by HI and MN 
assays, high intra- and inter-laboratory variability and between-assays agreement are still under 
scrutiny. Moreover, compared to HI assay, MN has been shown to detect higher proportion of positive 
samples, and thus to be more sensitive.  
For adults and especially children, immune correlates of protection for pandemic influenza strains have 
not been identified,  
Study results provided for antigen-adjuvant ratio dose selection are merely descriptive. Regards to 
antigen dose, no clear effect on immunogenicity is observed, with half adult dose achieving similar 
antibody responses to adult dose.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
6 months to <36 months age cohort 
The most frequently reported solicited local AEs occurring within 7 days after any vaccination the 6 
months to <36 months age cohort were tenderness (rates ranging from 11.8% to 22.9% across the 6 
vaccine groups) followed by erythema that occurred in 5.9% of subjects in Arm A and above 8% in the 
other arms.  
In the 6 months to <36 months age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after 
any vaccination were diarrhoea (11.1% to 28.6%), irritability (11.4% to 27.8%), and sleepiness (8.8% 
to 25.7%), with few severe events reported. No subjects had severe fever (≥40.0 °C).  
3 years to <9 years age cohort 
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE, with 
rates ranging from 13.5% to 36.1% across the 6 vaccine groups.  
In the 3 years to <9 years age cohort the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after any 
vaccination were fatigue (2.9% to 18.2%) and headache (5.4% to 11.1%) with few severe events 
reported. Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after any vaccination by 2.8% to 10.8% of subjects in the 6 
vaccine groups.

A slightly higher rate of Other Solicited AEs (Body temperature >38 °C) was noted in younger children 
(6 Months to <36 Months) in Arm F compared to other treatment arms after vaccination 1 only, 
together with a greater analgesic/antipyretic use. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Limited safety database  
A total of 420 subjects aged 6 months to <9 years received Foclivia in paediatric study V87_30 and 
only 70 subjects, equally divided among each age cohort, received the adult dose (7.5 μg/100%), the 
one chosen by the MAH also for children, limiting the detection of the rarer AEs as well as any different 
dose effect. However, the safety profile of Foclivia in children population in terms of antigen and 
adjuvant contents is known also from study V87_P6 and from data on Focetria, which is of some 
reassurance.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH conducted a dose-finding study in subjects aged 36 months-<9 years in order to investigate 
which among the 6 different antigen/adjuvant doses proposed could be more appropriate for paediatric 
population.  
Overall, the results indicate that Foclivia is immunogenic in children from 6 months to <9 years of age 
with increased antibody titers at 3 weeks after the second dose for all treatment arms, confirming that 
the 2-dose vaccine schedule is necessary to elicit immune response. Moreover, it was noted that 
subjects belonging to the younger age group (6–<36 months) displayed a higher immune response 
than older subjects (36 months-<9 years), suggesting that not-primed immune system in children 
enhances vaccine response.        
Across age cohorts all immunogenicity data at three weeks as well as at 6 months after second vaccine 
dose support that a 100% MF59 content is needed in the monovalent H5N1 pandemic preparedness 
vaccine to elicit an increased immunogenicity compared to that achieved with lower adjuvant content.  
Regards to antigen dose, no clear effect on immunogenicity is observed. While in vaccine arms D, E, F 
with 100% MF59 content, HI immune responses did not show relevant differences by increasing 
antigen dose, results obtained by MN assay seem to show slightly lower immune responses for Arm D 
compared to Arms E and F.  
With regard to the safety profile, solicited local and systemic reactions from day 1 through day 7 
appear to be similar among different H5N1 HA antigen doses and increasing MF59 content. 
The number of subjects with solicited AEs tended to decrease with vaccination 2 compared to 
vaccination 1 in each study arm. Moreover, solicited systemic AEs seem to occur more frequently in 
younger children (aged 6 months to < 36 months) compared to those in the 3 years to <9 years age 
cohort. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Among vaccine formulations with 100% MF59, the adult and half-adult antigen dose showed similar 
antibody responses and safety profile: while for the smaller antigen formulation a trend in lower 
immune responses was reported. Overall, no relevant reasons are identified for not supporting the use 
of vaccine full antigen-adjuvant dose (7.5 µg+100% MF59) also for the paediatric population (i.e., 
children and adolescents from 6 months to 17 years of age) as for the adult, when used in the context 
of a pandemic setting. It should be noted that Focetria was authorized and used with the same 
antigen-adjuvant dose as Foclivia in adult and paediatric populations (Immunogenicity and safety data 
with Focetria in paediatric population are currently reported in the Foclivia SmPC) and that previous 
study V87_P6 also tested full antigen-adjuvant dose for children from 6 months to 17 years.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Due to the pandemic nature of the vaccine, Foclivia MA remains under exceptional circumstances. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Foclivia is positive. Posology for children aged 6 months 18 years has been added to

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include children from 6 months to less than 18 years of age for Foclivia, 
based on final results from study V87_30; this is a phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, multicenter 
study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of several doses of antigen and MF59 adjuvant 
content in a monovalent H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy pediatric subjects 6 months to 
less than 9 years of age. As a consequence, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 4.11 of the RMP has been agreed. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to bring it in line with the latest 
QRD template. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

• 
CACZ885D1401, Drug Use Investigation of ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS 
solution for s.c. injection 150 mg 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CACZ885D1401-Drug Use Investigation of ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. 
injection 150 mg 
Description 
Study ACZ885D1401 was an observational study conducted in, which aimed to evaluate post-
marketing safety and efficacy on the long-term clinical use of ILARIS in cryopyrin-associated periodic 
syndromes (CAPS) patients. Study ACZ885D1401 enrolled 41 pediatric subjects (aged <18 years) and 
concluded on 15-Nov-2021 (final database lock).  
ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg was approved in for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic 
syndrome (CAPS) on September 26, 2011, under the condition that “Because of the extremely limited 
number of patients included in clinical studies in, post-marketing surveillance for safety and efficacy 
should be conducted by registering all patients treated with this drug during the re-examination period 
or until data from a certain number of patients are accumulated. In the post marketing surveillance, 
the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment, including the occurrence of infections, should be 
thoroughly investigated." 
This was a single-group, multicenter, observational study (drug use investigation) with no control 
group that is conducted in accordance with the GPSP Ordinance. 
The study included an observation period of 2 years and a follow-up period of up to 5 years.

Methods 
All-case surveillance was conducted by the central registration method. 
The observation period was 2 years from the start of treatment with ILARIS (for patients who 
discontinued or dropped out of treatment, until discontinuation or dropout of treatment). For patients 
who entered from the Japanese clinical trial D2308 (hereinafter, the clinical trial) to the post marketing 
clinical study after approval of ILARIS and switched from the investigational product to the marketed 
product, the observation period was 2 years from the switch (for patients who discontinued or dropped 
out of treatment, until discontinuation or dropout of treatment) with the day of switch as the start date 
of treatment. 
Study participants 
The investigation included all patients who used ILARIS in daily medical practice for a certain period of 
time after marketing for CAPS, including familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-
Wells syndrome (MWS), or neonatal onset multi-system inflammatory disease (NOMID). Patients who 
entered from a clinical trial to a post marketing clinical study after approval of ILARIS and then 
switched from the investigational product to the marketed product were also subject to registration. 
Although the investigation was to be started on or after the date of conclusion of the contract for the 
investigation, patients who started treatment with ILARIS before the date of conclusion of the contract 
were also enrolled in the investigation and the case report form was completed for them. 
Treatments 
ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg. This investigation is 
non-interventional and does not specify a treatment plan, treatment procedures, or visit schedule. 
Objective(s) 
The objective of this investigation was to collect and evaluate the following information under the long-
term clinical use in CAPS patients who used ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for 
s.c. injection 150 mg. 
1.  Unknown adverse reactions (particularly important adverse reactions) 
2.  Understanding of the occurrence status of adverse reactions under the actual use status of the 
drug 
3.  Factors that may affect the safety, efficacy, etc. 
4.  Understanding of safety (occurrence of infections and malignant tumors) and efficacy (severity of 
symptoms that may affect physical function and life prognosis) in long-term use 
5.  Priority investigation items: 
•  Occurrence of infections 
•  Occurrence of tuberculosis 
•  Occurrence of severe injection site reactions 
•  Occurrence of malignant tumors 
•  Occurrence of demyelinating disorders 
•  Occurrence of neutropenia 
•  Occurrence of hypercholesterolaemia 
•  Occurrence of hepatic function disorder

Results 
Participant flow and recruitment 
In total, 43 pediatric patients were enrolled in the study. The safety analysis set includes 41 patients, 
of which 39 patients (95.12%) completed the 2-year observation period and 2 patients (4.88%) 
prematurely discontinued from the study. The reasons for discontinuation were occurrence of adverse 
events and inadequate response (1 patient, 2.44% each). During the reexamination period, ILARIS 
was used for in 2 patients for the treatment of hyper-IgD syndrome (mevalonate kinase deficiency), 
which was not approved at the start of treatment with ILARIS, after consultation with the regulatory 
authorities. The safety analysis set therefore excludes these 2 patients with off-label use. 
Baseline data 
Among the 41 patients in the safety analysis set, the proportion of new patients was 73.17% (30 
patients) and the proportion of continued patients was 26.83% (11 patients). The median age 
(minimum to maximum) at the start of treatment with ILARIS was 5.5 (0 to 17) years in new patients 
and 10.0 (4 to 17) years in continuing patients. Only new patients had those aged < 2 years (8

patients, 26.67%) included. The median body weight (minimum to maximum) at the start of treatment 
with ILARIS was 17.35 (2.1 to 53.9) kg in new patients and 23.33 (15.0 to 46.7) kg in continuing 
patients. Among new patients, the most common phenotypes included were MWS (16 patients, 
53.33%) and NOMID (8 patients, 26.67%). A similar trend was observed for continuing patients where 
the most common phenotypes were NOMID (6 patients 54.55%) and MWS (5 patients, 45.45%).

Safety results 
The occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events in patients aged < 18 years is shown in 
Table 2-6. The incidence of adverse events in patients aged < 18 years was 92.68% (38 patients), and 
common adverse events by SOC were "infections and infestations" in 73.17% (30 patients) and 
"gastrointestinal disorders" in 31.71% (13 patients). Common adverse events by PT were bronchitis in 
36.59% (15 patients) and upper respiratory tract infection in 31.71% (13 patients). The incidence of 
serious adverse events in patients aged < 18 years was 19.51% (8 patients). Common serious adverse 
events by SOC were “infections and infestations” in 12.20% (5 patients) and "respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders" in 9.76% (4 patients). By PT, serious adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2 
patients were bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma in 7.32% (3 patients) each, and neutropenia in 
4.88% (2 patients), and the outcomes were all "resolved" or "resolving." The outcomes of all other 
serious adverse events observed in 1 patient each were either “resolved” or “resolving,” except for 
papilloedema (with sequelae), circulatory collapse and sepsis (fatal), and rhabdomyosarcoma 
(unknown). Overall, canakinumab was also well tolerated over longer term treatment in this study 
population, with no new safety signal detected and no change in frequency of known safety signals.

Adverse events in patients excluded from the safety analysis set 
In the 2 patients excluded from the safety analysis set, 24 adverse events were observed, and all of 
which were not related to ILARIS (Source: AE_L003_E). In the first excluded patient, 22 adverse 
events occurred. Nine events were considered serious by the investigator, including 2 events of 
vomiting and 1 event each of dehydration, gastroenteritis, tibia fracture, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis

viral, headache, and nasopharyngitis. The outcomes of all 9 serious adverse events were “resolved.” 
The outcomes of the 13 nonserious adverse events were “not resolved” for 1 event of inflammation 
and “resolved” or“resolving” for the other events. Two adverse events occurred in the second 
excluded patient. One event of gastroenteritis norovirus was considered serious and 1 event of upper 
respiratory tract infection was considered non-serious. The outcomes of both events were “resolved.” 
Death 
There was one fatal case. 
The events with fatal outcome were circulatory collapse and sepsis, which were both assessed as 
serious events and assessed as not related to ILARIS. Factors other than ILARIS were the underlying 
disease or complications. All other adverse events reported in this patient were assessed as not related 
to ILARIS. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of the finalized study CACZ885D1401, Drug Use Investigation, showed the efficacy of 
canakinumab in maintaining a treatment response and symptom control in the evaluated patients. 
Results showed a high proportion of complete and long term responders and patients in complete 
remission without relapse events. The efficacy of long-term treatment with ILARIS in CAPS patients in 
the routine clinical setting in was therefore consistent with that observed in global clinical studies. 
The overall safety profile of canakinumab in this study was consistent with previous global studies 
without any new safety signals observed and no change in frequency of known safety signals. 
Infections were the most frequently reported events during the observation. Infections and infestations 
are already described in the SmPC of canakinumab. The safety data presented showed no new safety 
findings compared to the known safety profile of canakinumab. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy and safety results of the presented investigational post approval study in in paediatric and 
adult subjects do not alter the benefit risk balance.  
Overall, the described safety findings are in line with the already known profile reflected in the SmPC.

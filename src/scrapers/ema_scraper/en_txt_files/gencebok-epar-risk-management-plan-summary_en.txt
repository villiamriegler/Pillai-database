Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Gencebok 
(Caffeine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Gencebok. The RMP details important risks 
of  Gencebok,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Gencebok's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Gencebok's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Gencebok should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Gencebok should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Gencebok's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Gencebok is authorised for the treatment of primary apnoea in premature newborns (see SmPC for the 
full indication). It contains caffeine as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion and 
orally.  
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Gencebok’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Gencebok’s  EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/gencebok. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Gencebok, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Gencebok's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
In the case of Gencebok, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Gencebok  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Gencebok. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
• 
Important Identified Risks 
Toxicity due to maternal caffeine ingestion 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Caffeine intake by the pregnant mother is widespread and therefore 
a concomitant fetal exposure, as shown by significant concentrations 
of  caffeine  from  most  cord  blood  samples,  no  obvious  deleterious 
effects on the neonate have been observed (Aranda 1979).  
Between November 2011 and September 2013, 506 preterm infants 
from 21 NICUs were enrolled into a PASS study (Lista 2016). Sixty-
nine  mothers  (13.6%)  confirmed  caffeine  consumption  prior  to 
delivery  and  54  (10.7%)  during  breast-feeding,  with  a  mean  intake 
of  1.4  units/day  (1  unit  =  a  cup  of  coffee  or  a  glass  of  drink 
containing  caffeine).  Despite  the  several  stratifications  performed  in 
this study there was none for the caffeine consumption in the mother 
and the safety/efficacy results are not distinguished in this subgroup 
from that in the whole patients’ sample. 
Risk factors and risk groups:

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
In a recent post approval safety study (Lista et al 2016), out of 506 
preterm  infants,  a  group  of  31  infants  with  hepatic  or  renal 
impairment were included. In comparison to the remaining patients, 
they  presented  a  higher  number  of  ADRs  (23%  vs.  3%).  Cardiac 
disorders, specifically tachycardia, were the most common ADRs and 
serious  AEs.  However,  the  percentages  of  severe  and  long-lasting 
ADRs were still low in this patient population. 
Furthermore,  due  to  the  low  incidence  of  these  conditions  in  the 
population analysed, it was difficult to identify a possible correlation 
between elevated plasma levels and the described increase in ADRs, 
and  so,  any  conclusion  regarding  an  eventual  dose  adjustment 
cannot  be  drawn  any  conclusion  regarding  an  eventual  dose

Cardiac disorder in infants with pre-existing cardiac disease, including arrhythmias 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
The  cardiovascular  effects  of  caffeine  were  evaluated  in  20  clinically 
stable  preterm  infants.  Ten  infants  received  intravenous  caffeine 
citrate with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 5 
mg/kg  every  24  hours,  and  10  infants  were  control  subjects.  These 
data  indicated  that  caffeine  administration  leads  to  a  significant 
increase  in  left  ventricular  output  in  preterm  infants  and  that  this 
inotropic effect is accompanied by a pressor effect (Walther 1990). 
There  were  no  changes  in  heart  rate,  blood  pressure  or  the 
autonomic nervous system tone following administration of caffeine, 
nor were the nonlinear dynamical properties of the system altered by 
caffeine.  Caffeine  does  not  have  detrimental  effects  on  heart  rate 
variability,  heart  rate  or  blood  pressure  in  conventional  doses  given 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to premature newborns (Ulanovsky 2014). 
In  a  recent  post  approval  safety  study  tachycardia  was  the  most 
frequent AE “of special interest” (5.0 and 13.5%, AOP group vs. off-
label group); in this prospective real-situation safety study however, 
only  in  6  patients  from  both  the  AOP  treatment  group  (2.3%)  and 
the  off-label  group  (2.5%)  was  tachycardia  classified  as  an  ADR  by 
the investigators (Lista 2016).

Treatment-related convulsions/seizures 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Compared  with  caffeine,  theophylline  therapy  has  been  associated 
with  increased  adverse  events  in  the  neonatal  population,  including 
seizures and hypokalemia (Schoen 2014). 
Caffeine has less plasma concentration fluctuations, and greater CNS 
penetration  without  producing  fluctuations  in  cerebral  blood  flow. 
Furthermore, theophylline therapy has been associated with seizures 
in the neonatal population (Abdel-Hady 2015). 
In  a  single  report  of  a  toxic  over-  dose  of  160  mg/kg  in  a  31-week 
gestation  1,860-g  infant,  the  serum  concentration  was  217.5  mg/L 
36.5  hours  after  dosing.  Toxic  manifestations  included  hypertonia, 
sweating, tachycardia, cardiac failure, pulmonary oedema, metabolic 
acidosis,  hyperglycemia,  and  creatine  kinase  elevation  (Natarajan 
2007). 
Case  reports  of  accidental  caffeine  overdose  in  premature  infants 
have  described  a  variety  of  acute  neurologic,  cardiovascular,  and 
metabolic  abnormalities.  Neurologic  symptoms  associated  with  an 
overdose  included  agitation,  irritability,  tremor,  opisthotonus,  and 
hypertonia, as well as tonic-clonic movements and nonpurposeful jaw 
and lip movements representative of seizure activity (Dobson 2013). 
However,  the  latter  reference  is  to  a  30-day-old  28-week  preterm 
newborn  who  was  exposed  to  300  mg.kg-1  caffeine  base  by  mouth 
accidentally. The patient exhibited agitations, irritability, tachycardia, 
tachypnoea,  diuresis,  electrolyte  abnormalities,  hyperglycaemia  and 
metabolic  acidosis,  for  which  he  received  supportive  treatment.  No 
seizure  activity  was  observed.  The  effects  of  intoxication  lasted  for 
96 h and then completely resolved. (Ergenekon 2001)

Important Potential Risks 
Decrease in weight gain / failure to thrive 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Caffeine  intake  during  pregnancy  were  analysed  by  the  CARE  Study 
Group  and highlighted  the  association  of  foetal  growth  restriction to 
caffeine consumption during pregnancy. 
Foetal  growth  restriction  secondary  to  high-dose  maternal  caffeine 
exposure is consistent across all trimesters. 
An  incremental  intake  of  caffeine  during  pregnancy  was  reported 
with LBW in 7% and small for gestational age (SGA) in 10%. 
18–21-month follow-up of caffeine-exposed infants for the treatment 
of  AOP  did  not  show  reduction  in  weight  or  head  circumference, 
somatic  effect  of  dose-  and  duration-specific  exposure  during  the 
neonatal period. 
During  a  15-year  study  period,  a  total  of  457  ELBW  and  VLBW 
infants  were  exposed  to  caffeine  citrate  (Philip  2018).  A  higher  rate 
of  increase  in  MDWG  was  found  for  the  lower  dose  group  (5 
mg/kg/day)  compared  with  the  higher  dose  group  (10 mg/kg/day): 
the MDWG were 17.2 ± 12 g vs. 13.0 ± 10.2 g (p=0.04). The dose 
of caffeine seems to be responsible for the slower increase in MDWG.

Caffeine withdrawal 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
A  literature  search  had  identified  only  4  articles-describing  infants 
born  to  mothers  who  consumed  large  quantities  of  caffeine  during 
pregnancy  (200  to  1800  mg  daily)  and  who  have  developed 
symptoms  attributed  to  caffeine  withdrawal,  such  as  irritability  and 
vomiting.  Apnea  has  also  been  reported  in  these  infants.  A  total  of 
14  infants  were  described,  with  detailed  case  information  provided 
for only 4 of the infants (Cafcit CDER evaluation 2000).  
ln  the  one  preterm  infant  (31  weeks  GA)  among  the  complete  case 
descriptions, a serum caffeine concentration of 40.3 mg/L was found 
on  day  4  of  life  prior  to  a  loading  dose  of  caffeine  administered  for 
AOP (Khanna 1984). The extrapolated serum level at birth, assuming 
a half-life of 100 hours, was 80 mg/L. No clinical evidence of caffeine 
toxicity  was  noted  at  any  time  during  the  hospital  stay.  Measured 
caffeine  levels  ranged  from  51.1  mg/l  at  day  23  of  life,  to  0.7  mg/l 
on day 37 of life; therapeutic caffeine was administered on at least 2 
occasions  during  the  infant's  hospital  stay.  The  authors  postulated 
that  the  apnea  could  be  a  manifestation  of  methylxanthine 
withdrawal. 
ln the 3 remaining documented case reports with adequate detail, all 
infants  were  2300  g  and  two  were  described  as  term  infants.  One 
infant  had  an  episode  of  apnea;  the  other  two  did  not.  Symptoms 
attributed  to  withdrawal  in  these  children  included  vomiting,  tonic 
episodes, bradycardia and cyanosis, and a dilated bowel gas pattern 
on  x-ray.  For  these  3  infants  and  an  additional  5  others  (McGowan 
1988),  tremulousness/jitteriness  was  noted  in  6,  and  nonbilious 
vomiting that required discontinuation of feeding was noted in 5. Two 
infants each were described as having bradycardia (with heart rates 
as  low  as  70bpm)  and  tachypnea  (>60  breaths/minute).  Vasomotor 
instability was observed in one infant. 
Five infants whose mothers reported substantial caffeine intake were 
reported to manifest neonatal abstinence syndrome, with symptoms 
beginning  at  approximately  5  days  of  age;  these  included  excessive 
crying,  irritability,  poor  sleep  patterns,  and  feeding  difficulties  and 
vomiting (Cafcit CDER report 2000). 
An  extensive  literature  search  on-caffeine  withdrawal  in  neonates 
identified  no  articles  on  withdrawal 
following 
discontinuation of caffeine therapy in preterm infants or neonates. A 
Medline  literature  search  by  the  FDA  Medical  reviewer  in  year  2000 
confirmed the absence of literature on neonatal withdrawal from the 
therapeutic use of caffeine. A similar search in 2019 does not provide 
additional findings in preterm infants.

Necrotising enterocolitis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
From  a  FDA  review  in  2000  (Cafcit  CDER  2000)  the  overall 
incidence  of  NEC  showed  variation from  centre to  centre,  as  well 
as within centre from one year to the next. The incidence of NEC 
observed in the Erenberg 2000 study (7.9% for caffeine exposed 
and  4.5%  for  placebo,  p=1.0)  is  within  the  range  reported  by 
multiple  sites  and  by  the  literature.  The  rate  of  NEC  seen  in 
association  with  caffeine  use  in  this  study  does  not  exceed 
historical ranges and the observed variability between and within 
sites  provides  a  potential  explanation  for  the  observed  numeric 
difference from placebo treatment. 
For  one  investigational  site,  incidence  data  for  NEC  were 
described  according  to  methylxanthine  use.  These  crude  data 
show  year-to-year  variation  in  the  incidence  of  NEC,  with  a 
greater  incidence  among  patients  treated  with  methylxanthines 
during  1994  and  1997.  Conversely,  the  incidence  of  NEC  was 
lower  among  methylxanthine-treated  patients  in  1995  and  1996. 
These  data  provided  reassurance  that  the  rates  of  NEC  seen 
among patients on methylxanthines ranged within historical limits 
described  in  the  literature.  However,  since  these  data  are  not 
adjusted 
in  birth  weight,  other  diagnoses 
(including AOP), and numerous other factors, they cannot provide 
any  conclusive  evidence  about  the  potential  association  of  NEC 
with methylxanthine use.

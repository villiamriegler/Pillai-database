CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Dukoral is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 
in adults and children from 2 years of age who will be visiting endemic/epidemic areas. 
The use of Dukoral should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into 
consideration the variability of epidemiology and the risk of contracting disease in different 
geographical areas and travelling conditions. 
Dukoral should not replace standard protective measures. In the event of diarrhoea measures of 
rehydration should be instituted.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Primary vaccination schedule 
The standard primary course of vaccination with Dukoral against cholera consists of 2 doses for 
adults and children from 6 years of age. Children 2 to below 6 years of age should receive 3 doses. 
Doses are to be administered at intervals of at least one week. If more than 6 weeks have elapsed 
between doses, the primary immunisation course should be re-started. 
Immunisation should be completed at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to V. cholerae O1. 
Booster dose 
For continuous protection against cholera a single booster dose is recommended within 2 years for 
adults and children from 6 years of age, and within 6 months for children aged 2 to below 6 years. No 
clinical efficacy data has been generated on repeat booster dosing. However, immunological and 
duration of protection data suggest that if up to 2 years have elapsed since the last vaccination for 
adults and up to 6 months for children aged 2 to below 6 years a single booster dose should be given. 
If more than 2 years have elapsed since the last vaccination (more than 6 months for children aged 2 
to below 6 years) the primary course should be repeated. 
Children less than 2 years 
Dukoral has been given to children between 1 and 2 years of age in safety and immunogenicity 
studies, but the protective efficacy has not been studied in this age group. Therefore, Dukoral is not 
recommended to be used in children less than 2 years of age.  
Elderly 
There are only very limited data on protective efficacy of the vaccine in subjects aged 65 years and 
more. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is intended for oral use. Before ingestion, the suspension should be mixed with the buffer 
(sodium hydrogen carbonate) solution. The sodium hydrogen carbonate is supplied as effervescent 
powder, which should be dissolved in a glass of cool water (approx. 150 ml). Chlorinated water can 
be used. The suspension should then be mixed with the buffer solution and drunk within 2 hours. 
Food and drink should be avoided 1 hour before and 1 hour after vaccination. Oral administration of 
other medicinal products should be avoided within 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of 
Dukoral. 
Children 2 to below 6 years of age: half of the buffer solution is poured away and the remaining part 
(approx. 75 ml) is mixed with the entire contents of the  vial. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to 
formaldehyde. 
Administration of Dukoral should be postponed for subjects suffering from acute gastrointestinal 
illness or acute febrile illness.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

No clinical data on protective efficacy of Dukoral against cholera after administration of booster 
doses are available. 
Dukoral confers protection specific to Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1. Immunisation does not protect 
against V. cholerae serogroup O139 or other species of Vibrio. 
In subjects infected with HIV, limited data are available on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. 
Vaccine protective efficacy has not been studied. Immunisation of HIV infected subjects could result 
in transient increases of viral load. Dukoral may not induce protective antibody levels in subjects with 
advanced HIV disease. However, an effectiveness study in a population with high HIV prevalence 
showed similar protection as in other populations.  
Antibody response in vaccinees with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be 
insufficient. 
Formaldehyde is used during the manufacturing process and trace amounts may be present in the final 
product. Caution should be taken in subjects with known hypersensitivity to formaldehyde. 
Dukoral contains approximately 1.1 g sodium per dose, which should be taken into consideration by 
patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
The vaccine does not provide complete protection and it is important to adhere additionally to 
standard protective measures to avoid cholera.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The vaccine is acid labile. Food and/or drink will increase acid production in the stomach and the 
effect of the vaccine may be impaired. Consequently, food and drink should be avoided 1 hour before 
and 1 hour after vaccination.  
Oral administration of other vaccines and medicinal products should be avoided 1 hour before and 1 
hour after administration of Dukoral.  
Preliminary results from a clinical study including a limited number of volunteers showed no 
interaction with the antibody response to Dukoral when a live oral vaccine (enterocapsules) against 
typhoid was given simultaneously with Dukoral. The immune response to live typhoid vaccine was 
not investigated in this study. Similarly, a yellow fever vaccine was given concomitantly with 
Dukoral, and there was no interaction observed with the immune response to the yellow fever vaccine. 
The immune responses to Dukoral were not studied. No other vaccines/ medicinal products, including 
oral polio vaccine and antimalarials, have been given simultaneously with Dukoral in clinical studies.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
No animal data on reproduction toxicity are available. Following careful benefit/risk assessment the 
vaccine may be administered during pregnancy and to breast-feeding women although no specific 
clinical studies have been performed to address this issue. 
During a mass-vaccination campaign conducted in Zanzibar, 196 pregnant women had received at 
least one dose of Dukoral. There was no statistically significant evidence of a harmful effect of 
Dukoral exposure during pregnancy. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
There is no evidence of an effect on the ability to drive and use machines.

The safety of Dukoral was assessed in clinical trials, including both adults and children from 2 years 
of age, conducted in endemic and non-endemic countries for cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia 
coli (ETEC) producing heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). Over 94,000 doses of Dukoral were administered 
during the clinical trials. Evaluation of safety varied between trials with respect to mode of 
surveillance, definition of symptoms and time of follow-up. In the majority of studies adverse events 
were assessed by passive surveillance. The most frequently reported adverse reactions, such as 
gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loose stools, nausea and vomiting, 
occurred at similar frequencies in vaccine and placebo groups.  
Frequency classification:  Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥
1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data).

allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Data on overdose are limited. Adverse reactions reported are consistent with those seen after the 
recommended dosing. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial vaccines, ATC-code: J07AE01 
Mechanism of action 
The vaccine contains killed whole V. cholerae O1 bacteria and the recombinant non-toxic B-subunit 
of the cholera toxin (CTB). Bacterial strains of both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes and of El Tor and 
Classical biotypes are included in the vaccine. Dukoral is taken orally with bicarbonate buffer, which 
protects the antigens from the gastric acid. The vaccine acts by inducing antibodies against both the 
bacterial components and CTB. The antibacterial intestinal antibodies prevent the bacteria from 
attaching to the intestinal wall thereby impeding colonisation of V. cholerae O1. The anti-toxin 
intestinal antibodies prevent the cholera toxin from binding to the intestinal mucosal surface thereby 
preventing the toxin-mediated diarrhoeal symptoms.  
The heat-labile toxin (LT) of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC ) is structurally, functionally and 
immunologically similar to CTB. The two toxins cross-react immunologically.  
Efficacy against cholera  
Efficacy against cholera was assessed in three randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical 
trials conducted in Bangladesh (endemic region) and in Peru (non-endemic region). The number of 
patients enrolled, dosage regimens and follow-up periods are shown in the following table.

In the Bangladesh field trial, protective efficacy of Dukoral in the overall population was 85% 
(95%CI: 56, 95, per-protocol analysis) for the initial 6 months of follow-up. Duration of vaccine 
protection differed by age, lasting for 6 months in children and for 2 years in adults (see table below). 
An exploratory analysis suggested that 2 vaccine doses seemed as effective as 3 doses in adults.

In the second trial, conducted in Peru and enrolling military recruits, the short-term protective efficacy 
against cholera after 2 vaccine doses was 85% (95%CI: 36, 97, per-protocol analysis). The third 
study, a field trial conducted in Peru, failed to show any protective efficacy against cholera during the 
first year. Following a booster dose 10-12 months after primary immunisation, the protective efficacy 
during the second year was 60.5% (95%CI: 28,79).  
Protective effectiveness against cholera was evaluated during two mass-vaccination campaigns 
conducted in Mozambique (December 2003 – January 2004) and Zanzibar (February 2009 – May 
2010).  
In the case-control study conducted during the mass vaccination campaign in Mozambique, protective 
effectiveness of 2 doses of Dukoral was 84% (95% CI: 43, 95, per-protocol analysis; p=0.005) for the 
initial 5 months of follow-up.  
In the longitudinal cohort-analysis conducted during the mass-vaccination campaign in Zanzibar, 
protective effectiveness after 2 doses of Dukoral was 79% (95% CI, 47, 92) for a follow-up period of 
15 months. In addition to the direct protection, it was shown that Dukoral provides significant indirect 
(herd) protection in the studied setting. 
Protective efficacy of Dukoral against cholera has not been studied following repeated booster 
vaccination. 
Immunogenicity 
No established immunological correlates of protection against cholera after oral vaccination have 
been identified. There is a poor correlation between serum antibody responses, including vibriocidal 
antibody response, and protection. Locally produced secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine 
probably mediate protective immunity. 
The vaccine induced intestinal antitoxin IgA responses in 70-100% of vaccinated subjects. Serum 
vibriocidal antibodies against the bacterial components were seen in 35-55% of vaccinated subjects 
and antitoxic antibodies in 78-87% of vaccinated subjects. A booster dose elicited an anamnestic 
response indicative of an immune memory. The duration of the immunological memory was estimated 
to last for at least 2 years in adults.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No preclinical safety testing with the vaccine has been conducted.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dukoral is and what it is used for 
Dukoral is an oral vaccine against cholera that stimulates the immunological defence in the gut. The 
vaccine protects adults and children from 2 years of age against cholera.  
Dukoral causes your body to produce its own protection against cholera. After getting the vaccine, 
your body will make substances called antibodies, which fight the cholera bacteria and toxin that 
cause diarrhoea.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Dukoral 
Do not use Dukoral 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to any ingredient of the vaccine or to formaldehyde. 
if you have an acute stomach disorder or infection with fever (vaccination should be delayed). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Dukoral 
•  if you take a medical treatment that affects the immune system   
•  if you have a disease of the immune system (including HIV infection).  
The vaccine may provide you with a lower level of protection than it does for people with healthy 
immune systems. 
The vaccine does not provide complete protection and it is important to adhere to dietary and hygiene 
advice to avoid diarrhoeal diseases. 
Children 
Do not give this vaccine to children younger than 2 years since the protection has not been studied in 
this group. 
Other medicines and Dukoral 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. 
Do not take other medicine starting 1 hour before until 1 hour after taking the vaccine.

Using Dukoral with food and drink 
Avoid food and drink starting 1 hour before until 1 hour after the vaccination. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby or are breast-feeding, 
ask your doctor before taking the vaccine.  
Driving and using machines 
 There are no reasons to suspect that Dukoral will affect your ability to drive or handle machines 
Dukoral contains sodium 
Dukoral contains approximately 1.1 g sodium per dose. Please take this into consideration if you are 
on a controlled sodium diet. 
How to use Dukoral 
3. 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check 
with your doctor if you are not sure. 
Adults and children from 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 2 doses taken orally (by mouth) 
at least 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart.  
•  Take the 1st dose no later than 2 weeks before you leave for your trip. 
•  Take the 2nd dose at least 1 week after the 1st dose and at least 1 week before your trip.  
It takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. 
For continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 2 years. If you had your last dose of 
vaccine less than 2 years ago a single dose will renew your protection. If more than 2 years have 
passed since you had the last vaccine dose, the primary vaccination (2 doses) should be repeated. 
Children of 2 to below 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 3 doses taken orally (by mouth) at 
least 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart. Only half of the amount of the buffer solution should be mixed 
with the vaccine.  
•  Give the 1st dose to the child no later than 3 weeks before you leave for your trip.  
•  Give the 2nd dose to the child at least 1 week after the 1st dose.  
•  Give the 3rd dose at least one week after the 2nd dose and at least one week before your trip. 
It takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. 
For continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 6 months. If less than 6 months 
have passed since the last vaccination a single dose will renew the protection. If more than 6 months 
have passed since the last vaccination, the primary vaccination (3 doses) should be repeated. 
The suspensionsupplied in a single-dose glass vial is a whitish suspension. Each vial comes with one 
sachet package that contains a white effervescent powder of sodium hydrogen carbonate.  The 
effervescent powder should be dissolved in a glass of cool water, and the resulting buffer solution 
should be mixed with the suspension. It is important to use the buffer solution, as it protects the 
vaccine from the gastric acid. 
Drink the entire mixture within 2 hours after mixing with the buffer solution. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions for use: 
1.  To prepare the buffer solution, dissolve the effervescent powder in a glass of cool water 
(approx. 150 ml) by gently stirring.  
Do not use any other liquid. 
For children of 2 to below6 years: pour away half of the buffer solution.  
2.  Shake the Dukoral® suspension vial (1 vial = 1 dose). 
3.  Pour the content of the Dukoral® suspension vial into the glass of buffer solution (see 1).  
Mix by gently stirring. 
4.  Drink the entire mixture within 2 hours. Avoid food and drink starting 1 hour before 
 until 1 hour after drinking the mixture.  
If you take more Dukoral than you should 
If you take the doses less than one week apart, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Because each vial of Dukoral contains only one dose, overdosage is unlikely.  
If you have taken more than one dose at one time, please contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forget to take Dukoral. 
You can take the 2nd dose of Dukoral up to 6 weeks after the 1st dose (children of 2 to below 6 years

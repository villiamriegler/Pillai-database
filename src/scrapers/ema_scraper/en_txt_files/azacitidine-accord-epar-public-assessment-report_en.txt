2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that manifest as bone marrow 
failure with the risk of life-threatening infections and bleeding. In a third of cases it may transform to acute 
myeloiod leukemia. Due to age and co-morbidities treatment options are limited; the only curative modality to 
date is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The advent of targeted therapy has increased the choice of 
therapeutic options. The methyl transferase inhibitor azacitidine, which targets epigenetic changes in MDS, has 
been shown to be effective in a Phase III randomized controlled trial comparing it with best supportive care (Raj 
K et al. 2006). 
About the product 
Azacitidine belongs to the group of ‘anti-metabolites’. Azacitidine is an analogue of cytidine, which means that 
it is incorporated into the genetic material of cells (RNA and DNA). It is thought to work by altering the way the 
cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA. These actions are 
thought to correct the problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that 
cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia. 
This Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is based on “essential similarity” to the original product in 
accordance with article 10.1.a.iii of Directive 2001/83/EC. The medicinal product is a generic of the reference 
medicinal product, which has been authorized within the community, in accordance with community provisions 
in force, for not less than eight years in a member state or in the community. The reference product is Vidaza 
powder for suspension for injection manufactured/marketed by Celgene Europe BV, Netherland. The indications 
sought for Azacitidine Accord are the same as those for Vidaza powder for suspension for injection:  
- Intermediate-2 and High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPSS), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/22245/2020 
Page 7/17 
  
  
 
 
 - Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (10%-29% marrow blasts without Myeloproliferative Disorder), 
 - Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health 
Organisation Classification (WHO), 
 - AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for suspension for injection containing 100 mg per vial of azacitidine 
as active substance, to be reconstituted in 4 mL of solvent (25 mg/mL).  
The only other ingredient is mannitol (E421)   
The product is available in colourless type I glass vials sealed with butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal with 
plastic button, containing 100 mg of azacitidine, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The chemical name of azacitidine is 
(2R,3R,4S,5R)-4-amino-1-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran-yl)-1H-[1,3,5]triazin-2-one, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C8H12N4O5. It has a relative molecular mass of 244.20 g/mol and the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of azacitidine was elucidatedby a combination of IR, UV, 1H NMR, 
13C NMR, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.  The solid-state properties of the active substance were 
measured by XRD. 
Azacitidine is a white to off-white solid, moderately soluble in water (13.41 mg/ml at 25 C), it is 
non-hygroscopic.  
Azacitidine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres.  Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by specific optical rotation in the active substance specifications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/22245/2020 
Page 8/17 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Based on the literature survey, azacitidine active substance exhibits polymorphism. It was adequately 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process consistently results in the same polymorphic form, as shown by 
P-XRD analysis.  
Nonetheless, since the active substance is dissolved during the compounding step of the manufacturing process 
of the finished product, the potential presence of polymorphic molecules in the active substance is not 
considered relevant for the performance of the product. 
Manufacture 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Azacitidine is manufactured by non-sterile and non-aseptic process by a single manufacturer.  The active 
substance is synthesized in four main steps using starting materials with acceptable specifications. Detailed 
information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF 
and it was considered satisfactory. The manufacturing process has been validated. Adequate in-process controls 
are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 
as amended, placed inside a triple laminated bag with silica gel pouches and stored inside a HDPE drum. 
In the context of the on-going review under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 related to the potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-information-nitrosamin
es-marketing-authorisation-holders_en.pdf, 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-questions-answers-infor
mation-nitrosamines-marketing-authorisation_en.pdf), MAHs of products containing chemically-synthesized 
active substances are being asked to review their products for potential presence of nitrosamine impurities and 
to conduct risk evaluations/risk assessments as appropriate.  
No risk evaluation has been submitted for azacitidine and Azacitidine Accord within the current procedure. 
Therefore, it is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential risk of presence of nitrosamine in azacitidine 
and Azacitidine Accord is conducted after the marketing authorisation, within six months of the publication of the 
call for review (19th September 2019). In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result 
of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive 
methods within 3 years of the publication of the call for review (19th September 2019), or at an earlier time if 
otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be 
implemented.  
Specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/22245/2020 
Page 9/17 
  
  
 
 
The active substance specification includes tests for  appearance/description, identity (IR, HPLC), solubility 
(Ph.Eur.), assay (HPLC), specific optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), sulphated 
ash (Ph.Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.),  water content (Ph.Eur.),  microbial content (Ph.Eur.), tin content 
(ICP-OES). 
The maximum daily dose (MDD) for azacitidine is 200 mg/day (100 mg/m2). Therefore the ICH recommended 
thresholds for reporting, identification and qualification are 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15%, respectively. The 
proposed limits for the specified impurities are controlled in-line with ICH Q3A, hence are acceptable from a 
safety point of view.  
A risk assessment for elemental impurities was performed, including an elemental impurities screening by 
ICP-OES on three batches of azacitidine. The total level of all elemental impurities analyses was below 30 % of 
ICH Q3D limit.   
No Class 1 solvents are employed throughout the synthetic process.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for batches at commercial scale of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial size batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer, 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions and up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions were provided. The temperature conditions chosen by the Applicant are in line with 
those authorized for the innovator Vidaza. This is considered acceptable.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR), appearance (Ph.Eur), water content (KF), 
related substances (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was 
investigated during forced degradation studies. The active substance did not show signs of degradation after 
exposure to light without the protection of the primary packaging material. The finished product was hence not 
considered to be photosensitive. Results on stress conditions were also provided.  
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period at the proposed storage conditions.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Azacitidine, powder for suspension for injection, 25 mg/mL (100 mg/vial) is a white lyophilized powder or cake 
filled in a clear glass vial. 
The finished product azacitidine powder for suspension for injection (100 mg/vial) was developed to be identical 
to Vidaza by Celgene from the European market. The finished product manufacturer has performed a number of 
comparative studies to demonstrate that Azacitidine Accord is comparable to the reference product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/22245/2020 
Page 10/17 
  
  
 
The formulation of azacitidine is identical to that of the reference product Vidaza. A comparison of the in-vitro 
release of the active substance between the test and the reference product was conducted. The finished product 
is a suspension for subcutaneous injection, and as such it is not covered by the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **).  Moreover, due to the high solubility of the active 
substance azacitidine in water at 37 ºC (i.e. at biorelevant conditions), it is recognized that developing a 
discriminatory dissolution method for the proposed product is very difficult. During the evaluation procedure, 
CHMP agreed that a biowaiver for BE studies for azacitidine generics can be acceptable, provided that some 
criteria are satisfied. In particular, the two most relevant parameters 'Particle size distribution' and 'Particle 
morphology' should be included in the specifications for the finished product. In addition, the applicants should 
demonstrate similarity with regard to pH, osmolality and viscosity, and provide results from a suitably designed 
test for the reconstituted product measuring and comparing “time/temperature to clear solution” after 
reconstitution between test and reference products. Specifications for PSD and for particle morphology were 
included in the finished product to assure that the performance of each batch is similar to the original product, 
on the basis of the in-vitro comparability studies performed. Similarly, the Applicant showed that time and 
temperature to clear solution were equivalent to the reference product. In addition, parameters pH, viscosity 
and osmolality were shown to be similar between test and reference product. Therefore, the biowaiver for the BE 
studies is considered supported.  
The excipient mannitol is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. It is the same as that in the reference product.  
The primary packaging is colourless type I glass vial sealed with butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal with 
plastic button. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the components used in the manufacture of Azacitidine Accord is of human or animal origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of azacitidine powder for suspension for injection consists of a simple preparation of 
a  bulk  solution,  followed  by  sterile  filtration  and  subsequent  lyophilisation;  it  is  considered  a  non-standard 
process. A summary of the in-process information during manufacture is provided to confirm that the proposed 
azacitidine powder for suspension for injection can be manufactured according to the proposals in the dossier. 
The  information  provided  on  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  sufficient.  All  process  parameters  as 
discussed in the pharmaceutical development section and verified during process validation are provided. The 
description also includes additional details related to the filters and maximum acceptable holding times and 
holding temperatures of the bulk solution are clearly stated. A summary of the in-process information during 
manufacture is provided to confirm that the proposed azacitidine powder for suspension for injection can be 
manufactured according to the proposals in the dossier. The proposed maximum acceptable holding time and 
holding temperature of the bulk solution should be clearly stated. All parameters and attributes were found to be 
within acceptable ranges and according to acceptance criteria. Results from media fill runs demonstrate that the 
aseptic filling process gives a sterile product with high assurance. 
Process validation was carried out on several batches at commercial scale. Major steps of the manufacturing 
process (sterilisation, filtration, lyophilisation and aseptic process steps) have been validated by a number of 
studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
Assessment report

manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification of the active substance (UV and HPLC), pH of reconstituted suspension, water content (KF), assay 
(HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (weight  variation),  related  substances  (HPLC),  sterility  (Ph.Eur),  BET 
(Ph.Eur),  PSD  (laser  diffraction),  reconstitution  time,  sub-visible  particles(Ph.Eur),  particle  morphology  and 
osmolarity(Ph.Eur).  
The maximum daily dose (MDD) for Azacitidine Accord is 200 mg. Therefore, the ICH recommended thresholds 
for reporting, identification and qualification in the finished product are 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively. The 
proposed limits for specified and unspecified impurities are in-line with ICHQ3B and hence acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. Forced degradation studies were performed in connection with the HPLC methods for assay 
and  related  substances.  Peak  purity  was  investigated  and  mass  balance  is  demonstrated.  The  methods  are 
considered as stability indicating. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  batches  at  commercial  scale,  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 
ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Azacitidine  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for stability indicating parameters. The analytical procedures used are the same as for 
release. All results remained within specifications and no significant changes were observed.  
Compatibility data provided supported the in-use shelf life of the reconstituted product.  
A photostability study has been performed on one batch of Azacitidine finished product in vials, as well as vials 
wrapped and protected by Al-foil. The conditions of the study were selected according to ICH Q1B. The finished 
product did not show signs of degradation after exposure to light without the protection of the primary and/or 
secondary packaging materials. Thus, it can be concluded that Azacitidine powder for suspension for injection is 
photostable when stored in the primary container.   
In  view  of  the  provided  stability  data,  the  Applicant  proposes  36  months  shelf-life  with  no  special  storage 
conditions for the drug product. All tested quality attributes remain well within the proposed acceptance criteria.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/22245/2020 
Page 12/17 
  
  
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage condition as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The product has been developed as a generic of Vidaza.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the review of the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products and 
the need for the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress and to investigate the risk of 
presence of nitrosamine in their medicinal products, the CHMP recommends the following: 
It is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in azacitidine and 
Azacitidine Accord is conducted after the marketing authorisation, within six months of the publication of the call 
for review (19th September 2019). In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of 
the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive 
methods within 3 years of the publication of the call for review (19th September 2019), or at an earlier time if 
otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be 
implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable (please see also above).  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Azacitidine Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to result in

any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all azacitidine containing products and the exposure 
of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
The impurity profile of applicant’s azacitidine is comparable to that of Vidaza. Thus, additional toxicology studies 
to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required (please see also the recommendation in 
section 2.2.6). 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Azacitidine Accord is a generic of the reference product Vidaza. The literature 
data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-clinical aspects 
of Azacitidine Accord in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Azacitidine Accord 25 mg/mL powder for suspension for injection containing azacitidine.  
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the CHMP consulted its Pharmacokinetics and Quality Working Parties (please see 
also below).  
Exemption  
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application. The CHMP considered that a biowaiver for a 
generic azacitidine powder for suspension for injection product is acceptable considering that the test and 
reference product have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same 
qualitative and very similar quantitative composition in excipients, that the provided in vitro data demonstrate 
high aqueous solubility of azacitidine, rapid and similar dissolution rate between the test and reference products 
and that the reconstitution instructions for the products by healthcare professionals prior to administration, 
which requires vigorous shaking, are common between test and reference product. 
2.4.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

2.4.2.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided and is adequate.  
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application which is in line with the CHMP WPs view that 
a biowaiver for BE studies for azacitidine generics is acceptable, please see above.  
Azacitidine Accord is considered essentially similar to Vidaza, Celgene Europe B.V. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Azacitidine Accord was provided and was accepted by 
the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, WPs positions and additional clinical studies were 
not considered necessary. Azacitidine Accord is considered essentially similar to Vidaza, Celgene Europe B.V.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of azacitidine 25 mg/mL powder for suspension for injection. The 
reference product Vidaza is indicated for  
- 
intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
- 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative 
disorder, 
- 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World 
Health Organisation (WHO) classification, 
- 
AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information.  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Azacitidine Accord is not similar to Revlimid, Dacogen, Rydapt, 
Mylotarg, Vyxeos or Xospata within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

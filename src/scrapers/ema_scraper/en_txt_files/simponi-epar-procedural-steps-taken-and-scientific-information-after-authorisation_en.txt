active ulcerative colitis (UC). Thirty-five (35) patients were 
included and around 29% of the patients were between 2-
11 years old and around 43% of the patients had a weight 
<45 kg (including 5 patients with a weight<30kg).
The serum golimumab concentrations appeared to be 
relatively comparable between paediatrics with UC with a 
body weight ≥45 kg and adults with UC when compared 
within the same body weight categories. There seemed to 
be a trend towards lower mean serum concentration in 
paediatrics weighing < 45 kg (who received the BSA-
adjusted dose regimen) as compared to those weighing ≥ 
45 kg and compared to the reference adults UC population 
(who received the flat fixed dose regimen). 
The overall safety profile in this small paediatric UC study 
was consistent with the known safety profile of golimumab 
with no new safety concerns identified.

There is a moderate amount (approximately 400) of

PASS study CNTO148ART4001 listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP; this is an observational 
prospective cohort study to collect and analyse 
information pertaining to pregnancy outcomes of 
women exposed to golimumab during pregnancy. 
prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to golimumab 
resulting in live birth with known outcomes, including 220 
pregnancies exposed during the first trimester. In a 
population-based study from Northern Europe including 131 
pregnancies (and 134 infants), there were 6/134 (4.5%)

biologic systemic therapy compared to 4.6% in the general 
population of the study. Confounder-adjusted odds ratios 
were OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.35-1.81) for Simponi vs. non-
biologic systemic therapy and OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.42-2.16) 
for Simponi vs. the general population, respectively.
Due to its inhibition of TNF, golimumab administered during 
pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the 
newborn. Studies in animals do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal 
development (see section 5.3). The available clinical 
experience is limited. Golimumab should only be used 
during pregnancy if clearly needed.

treatment withdrawal was assessed in adult patients (18-45 
years of age) with active nr-axSpA who demonstrated 
sustained remission during 10 months of monthly 
treatment with open label Simponi (GO-BACK). Eligible 
patients (who achieved a clinical response by Month 4 and 
an inactive disease status (ASDAS <1.3) at both Months 7 
and 10) entering the double-blind withdrawal phase were 
randomised to continued monthly treatment with Simponi 
(full-treatment regimen, N = 63), every 2-month treatment 
with Simponi (reduced treatment regimen, N = 63) or 
monthly placebo treatment (treatment withdrawal, N = 62) 
for up to approximately 12 months.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of 
patients without a flare of disease activity. Patients who 
experienced a flare, i.e., had an ASDAS collected at 2 
consecutive assessments that both showed either an 
absolute score of  ≥ 2.1 or post-withdrawal increase of  ≥ 
1.1 relative to Month 10 (end of open-label period), 
reinitiated monthly Simponi in an open-label retreatment

treated with a non-biologic medication were noted. Results 
of the current safety evaluation are consistent with reports 
of Simponi safety and are generally comparable with 
observations from other studies in patients with rheumatic 
disease. Overall, no new safety signals arose from this 
study warranting updates to the product information, but 
some methodological issues remain. There are some 
uncertainties with regards to “Serious depression including 
suicidality” and this should remain as an important 
potential risk in the risk management plan (RMP) and the 
risk should be reviewed in the next PSUR. 
The list of safety concerns in the RMP is also updated in 
accordance with Guideline on good pharmacovigilance 
practices (GVP) Module V, revision 2. With this update, 
congestive heart failure is removed from the list of 
important identified risk in the Simponi RMP, this results in 
an amendment of the Annex II condition and Annex IIIA 
(labelling); namely to remove “congestive heart failure” 
from the patient reminder card. Breakthrough infection 
after administration of live vaccine in infants exposed to 
golimumab in utero is added in the patient reminder card 
as this was a missing information.

potentially life threatening nature of the event and the fact 
that agranulocytosis is a rare condition that is often drug-
related, section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated to 
include agranulocytosis to inform prescribers of this

single post-marketing case of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
(BCG) disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection after 
concurrent use of infliximab for the treatment of ulcerative 
colitis and use of BCG by bladder instillation for the 
treatment of bladder cancer. A clear causal association 
between infliximab and the onset of disseminated BCG 
infection could not be determined due to confounding 
factors but could not be excluded.
Upon analysis, the MAH concluded that this case 
represented a situation similar to receiving a live vaccine 
because BCG is a live attenuated form of Mycobacterium 
bacillus. The risks of infection and complications from 
infections following administration of a live vaccine have 
been reported to be much higher in patients whose immune 
systems have been compromised than in the healthy 
population. The MAH therefore proposed to update the 
product information to change the section heading of the 
Vaccination section to reflect the need to consider other 
therapeutic infectious agents, not just vaccines and to add 
a warning to not administer therapeutic infectious agents 
concurrently with Remicade or Simponi. This was agreed by

reported at least 1 screening result that was suggestive of 
TB. Five of these cases reported use of TB prophylaxis prior 
to starting golimumab. In addition, 3 subjects, where 
screening results were negative or not reported, received 
prophylaxis which may indicate clinical suspicion of latent 
TB. Thus, a total of 8 subjects developed TB on golimumab 
treatment, despite having received prophylactic treatment. 
One of the cases, occurring within a clinical study, was 
fatal. It is acknowledged that it is not proven that all the 
cases were reactivations and not a second primary disease. 
However it seems unlikely that a second community 
acquired infection, i.e. new exposure was the reason in all 
cases. In the fatal case this explanation is particularly 
improbable, since it was a disseminated infection and no 
known TB exposure.
The product information has therefore been updated to 
raise awareness that cases of active tuberculosis have 
occurred in patients treated with Simponi during and after 
treatment for latent tuberculosis. Patients receiving 
Simponi should be monitored closely for signs and 
symptoms of active tuberculosis, including patients who 
tested negative for latent tuberculosis, patients who are on 
treatment for latent tuberculosis, or patients who were 
previously treated for tuberculosis infection.

identified 19 reports for infliximab and none for golimumab. 
All 19 reports were postmarketing cases. No MCC cases 
were observed in registries and clinical trials. Of the 19 
reports there were 2 fatalities reported in patients either 
taking multiple immunosuppressants concomitantly with 
infliximab or with limited information regarding medical 
history. Of the 19 reports, most of them had confounding 
factors (i.e. one or more risk factors for MCC such as prior 
immunosuppressant history, concomitant 
immunosuppressant therapies, and/or a history of 
malignancy) limiting the causality assessment with 
infliximab. Based on this review, MCC is considered causally 
associated with the use of infliximab, and a drug class 
effect to TNF inhibitors. Key factors supporting this 
conclusion include the biological plausibility based on 
immunosuppression by TNF-α inhibitors, the apparent 
sensitivity of MCC to immunosuppression, and the elevated 
reporting rate compared with the background rate of this 
type of cancer, all which suggest an association of MCC 
with this drug class. MCC is therefore added to section 4.8, 
with a frequency category of “Not known” for both 
infliximab and golimumab, as the frequemcy of the event 
cannot be estimated from the available data. The severity 
and seriousness of the event of MCC also justify its addition 
to section 4.4 to warn the physicians that cases of MCC 
have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker 
therapy and to recommend periodic skin examination, 
particularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer..
The cumulative review of melanoma cases, coincident with 
infliximab or golimumab use, from registries, clinical trials 
and postmarketing identified 385 reports for infliximab and 
14 for golimumab. For infliximab, there were 2 reports from 
Page 32/46
clinical trials, 333 from postmarketing and 50 from 
registries. For golimumab there were 6 clinical trials 
reports, 7 postmarketing and 1 registry reports. In the FDA 
AERS database, there were significant numbers of cases of 
melanoma events with all of the TNF-α blockers. In more 
than 50% of the cases there were associated risk factors 
limiting the causality assessment with the drugs. Based on 
the overall data, it remains unclear whether a causal 
relationship exists between infliximab or golimumab use 
and the development of melanoma, however the possible 
contribution of infliximab or golimumab use to the risk 
cannot be excluded. Based on the data, the frequency 
category of melanoma is “rare” (1/10,000 and <1/1,000) 
for both infliximab and golimumab.

exfoliation. No cases with the diagnosis erythema 
multiforme, Steven Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal 
Necrolysis, representing severe skin reactions were 
retrieved. In clinical trials, two serious cases (dermatitis 
exfoliative and skin exfoliation) were reported in patients 
who received golimumab with concomitant therapy. In the 
postmarketing setting, six nonserious cases of  skin 
exfoliation were reported: 3 cases of nonserious psoriatic-
like desquamation, 2 cases with skin lesions likely due to 
other etiology, and one case of skin exfoliation with 
concomitant methotrexate use. All cases reported a 
plausible temporal relationship between exposure to 
golimumab and skin exfoliation. It was concluded that the 
development of skin exfoliation is reasonably likely to be 
causally associated with the use of golimumab and that the 
term skin exfoliation should be added to section 4.8 of the 
Page 33/46
SmPC. The frequency ‘rare’ was based on the two cases 
reported from clinical studies, in relation to in total 5,100 
patients treated in these studies.

that there are a number of uncertainties regarding whether

there is a causal association between anti-TNF agents and 
leukaemias or paediatric malignancies or not. Nevertheless, 
given the mechanism of action of these agents, the 
possible risks for the development of such malignancies 
with use of agents of this class cannot be excluded. Thus, 
the amendments to the warning in section 4.4 have been 
introduced addressing the potential risk for the 
development of paediatric malignancies and leukaemia in 
patients treated with TNF-antagonists.
The MAH also conducted an independent class evaluation of 
TNF product labelling in major regions such as the US and 
EU, as well as a TNF medical literature review. As a result, 
the MAH has added safety information to the Simponi 
product information regarding the concomitant use of 
anakinra and abatacept with TNF-blockers and 
precautionary text regarding the switching between 
biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs).

collection practices at one single clinical trial site of study 
C0524T11, selected key efficacy parameters at Week 24 
such as primary endpoint, major secondary endpoints, and 
other key secondary endpoints were re-analyzed by the 
MAH excluding the data from this site. Safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data were left unchanged. 
Overall the conclusions regarding the statistical significance 
of the results in the C0524T11 study were unchanged with 
the following 2 exceptions:

group and the placebo group in improvement from baseline 
in HAQ score at Week 24 for subjects who discontinued 
prior anti-TNF? therapy(s) due to lack of efficacy changed 
from being significant (p=0.045) to not significant 
(p=0.067).
"
The number of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg 
group who had an ACR 90 response changed from being 
statistically significant (p = 0.042) to statistically not 
significant (p = 0.077).
In addition, the removal of the efficacy data collected at 
this site changed the p-value for the primary endpoint (ACR 
20 response of the golimumab 50 mg group) from p<0.001 
to p=0.001; however, the primary endpoint remained 
statistically significant.
The reanalysis of efficacy data did not critically change the 
overall results for key efficacy parameters (such as the co-
primary endpoint, percentage of patients achieving an ACR 
20 response at week 14). Accordingly, the risk/benefit 
analysis for the approved indication remains favourable and 
the applicant's proposed SmPC changes in section 5.1 are 
agreed with.

early PPMS are considered as not statistically compelling.

SmPC and PL 
In a randomized open-label study, patients with relapsing 
in order to include information on vaccination based 
on interim results from study BN29739 listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP; this is a phase IIIb, 
multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, open-label 
study to evaluate the effects of ocrelizumab on 
immune response in patients with relapsing forms of 
multiple sclerosis. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 2.3 has also been 
submitted. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement a minor editorial change in 
section 6.6 of the SmPC with regards to instructions 
for dilution. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) were able to mount 
humoral responses, although decreased, to tetanus toxoid, 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide with or without a 
booster vaccine, keyhole limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, 
and seasonal influenza vaccines.  The percentage of 
patients with a positive response to tetanus vaccine at 8 
weeks after vaccination was 23.9% in the ocrelizumab 
group compared to 54.5% in the control group (no disease-
modifying therapy except interferon-beta).   Geometric 
mean anti-tetanus toxoid specific antibody titers at 8 weeks 
were 3.74 and 9.81 IU/ml, respectively. Positive response 
to 5 serotypes in 23-PPV at 4 weeks after vaccination was 
71.6% in the ocrelizumab group and 100% in the control 
group.  In patients treated with ocrelizumab a booster 
vaccine (13-PCV) given 4 weeks after 23-PPV did not 
markedly enhance the response to 12 serotypes in common 
with 23-PPV.  The percentage of patients with 
seroprotective titers against five influenza strains ranged 
from 20.060.0% and 16.743.8% pre-vaccination and at 
4 weeks post vaccination from 55.680.0% in patients 
treated with ocrelizumab and 75.097.0% in the control 
group, respectively. 
It is recommended to vaccinate patients treated with 
Ocrevus with seasonal influenza vaccines that are 
inactivated.  Due to the potential depletion of B cells in 
infants of mothers who have been exposed to Ocrevus 
during pregnancy, vaccination with live or live-attenuated 
vaccines should be delayed until B-cell levels have 
recovered; therefore, measuring CD19-positive B-cell 
levels, in neonates and infants, prior to vaccination is 
recommended. All vaccinations other than live or live-
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attenuated should follow the local immunisation schedule 
and measurement of vaccine-induced response titers 
should be considered to check whether individuals have 
mounted a protective immune response because the 
efficacy of the vaccination may be decreased. 
Postponing vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines 
should be considered for neonates and infants born to 
mothers who have been exposed to Ocrevus in utero.

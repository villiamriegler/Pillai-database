Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to

10/05/2021 
SmPC, Annex II 
The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated as follows: 
add a recommendation regarding monitoring of 
and PL 
Tigecycline may prolong both prothrombin time (PT) and 
coagulation parameters prior to and during tigecycline 
treatment based on post-marketing data and to 
update the frequency of the existing adverse drug 
reaction hypofibrinogenaemia from ‘Not known’ to 
‘Rare’. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to update the PI in line with the 
Annex to the European Commission guideline on 
`Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of 
medicinal products for human use' 
(EMA/CHMP/302620/2017 Rev.1) regarding sodium 
content and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.1. 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Additionally, 
hypofibrinogenaemia has been reported with the use of 
tigecycline. Therefore, blood coagulation parameters such as 
PT or other suitable anticoagulation test, including blood 
fibrinogen, should be monitored prior to treatment initiation 
with tigecycline and regularly while on treatment. Special 
care is recommended in seriously ill patients and in patients 
also using anticoagulants (see section 4.5). 
The PL has been updated accordingly.

SmPC and PL 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated as follows:  
interaction information regarding the concomitant use 
of tigecycline and calcineurin inhibitors, based on 
pharmacovigilance data; the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Concomitant use of tigecycline and calcineurin inhibitors 
such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine may lead to an increase in 
serum trough concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitors. 
Therefore, serum concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitor 
should be monitored during treatment with tigecycline to 
avoid drug toxicity. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

studies total). The update in section 4.4 of the SmPC for cIAI 
is based on studies 301,306,315, 316 and 400 and for cSSTI 
is based on studies 300,305 and 900. As the number of all 
subjects treated has changed, the proportions of indications 
and special populations treated with Tygacil have changed. 
In section 4.8 of the SmPC, the frequency of sepsis/septic 
shock, hyponatraemia and injection site reaction have 
upgraded from uncommon to common. In addition, the 
number of cSSTI and cIAI patients treated with Tigecycline 
has included the patients of the studies phase III and IV 
completed during the post-marketing. The number of 
subjects with nausea or vomiting and the number of subjects 
with infection-related serious adverse events or sepsis/septic 
shock has been updated taking into account the Phase III 
and IV integrated data.

This type II variation aimed to include 6 patients with 
additional data from 6 patients with complicated 
inter-abdominal infection trials who died, but did not 
have an adverse event with an outcome of death. The 
MAH also took the opportunity to update the wording 
on the paediatric patients in section 4.2 of the Tyagcil 
SmPC to bring it in line with the current SmPC 
guideline. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of 
the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
complicated intra-abdominal infections, enrolled in the 
Tygacil phase 3 trials, who died, but whose death was not the 
outcome of an adverse event (in scientific terms these 
patients "did not have an adverse event with an outcome of 
death"), in the existing mortality data summary in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. CHMP acknowledged that all previous 
mortality analyses were based on patients whose death was 
the outcome of an adverse event (in scientific terms patients 
which "had an adverse event with an outcome of death")and 
that these 6 deaths in cIAI patients (2 Tygacil- and 4 
comparator treated) from studies 301 and 306 were 
excluded from these analyses because the events leading to 
death were not reported in the patient’s adverse event case 
report form.  
CHMP noted that the current all-cause mortality results 
presented in section 4.8 of the Tygacil SmPC consist of 
study-level counts and percent of deaths and agreed that 
updating the results according to the MAH’s proposal would 
contribute to the mortality data completeness.

PK parameters from the two studies and with the information 
that the safety data observed in the multiple-dose PK study, 
(although limited due to the small number of children 
enrolled and to the fact that 3 doses were tested) was 
consistent with the type of adverse events already reported 
by adult patients such as nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis etc. 
Overall, the CHMP agreed that safety and efficacy of 
tigecycline in children needs to be demonstrated and agreed 
to include the new paediatric data in the Tygacil SmPC.

An estimated frequency of Stevens-Johnson syndrome could 
not be determined for this adverse event since the identified 
reports include only spontaneous cases and true exposure 
data from these sources are limited. 
After a search of the MAH's database, the MAH further 
identified "Hypoglycaemia" and "Pneumonia" as additional 
adverse events to be included in section 4.8. Based on an 
evaluation of the incidences in the pivotal phase III studies 
the estimated frequencies of pneumonia (1.4%) and 
hypoglycaemia (1.2%) have been determined to fall within 
the CIOMS frequency category of Common

hepatic failure associated with tigecycline. On the basis of 
this review, the SPC has been updated as follows: 
- Section 4.8: Hepatic failure has been added as ADR under 
the frequency category of "not known".  
- Section 4.4:  The wording "Cases of liver injury with a 
predominantly cholestatic pattern have been reported in 
patients receiving tigecycline treatment, including some 
cases of hepatic failure with a fatal outcome. Although 
hepatic failure may occur in patients treated with tigecycline 
due to the underlying conditions or concomitant medications, 
a possible contribution of tigecycline should be considered. 
(see section 4.8)" has been added in order to reflect isolated 
cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure 
which may occur associated to tigecycline treatment.

Section 4.8 of the SPC was also updated regarding 
prevalence of acquired resistance to Bacteroides

variation II.13. Additionally the marketing 
authorisation holder took the opportunity to update

setting, a causal relationship for the development of jaundice 
and liver injury in patients treated with tigecycline cannot be 
excluded. Therefore the undesirable effects section of the 
product information was updated to include these adverse 
events with a frequency of uncommon (the frequency was 
concluded based on data from clinical trials).  
Further information regarding susceptibility was available 
and therefore the product information was updated: 
decreased susceptibility of the bacteria Acinetobacter 
baumannii was linked with overexpression of one of the 
pumps which transports molecules out of the cell (called 
AdeAB); Bacteroides fragilis bacteria group was moved to 
the category species for which acquired resistance may be a 
problem.

the assessment of PSUR No 3 covering the period from 
15 June 2006 to 14 December 2006 following CHMP 
request. Section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated to 
include a warning on early detection of the onset or 
worsening of acute pancreatitis. Section 4.8 of the SPC 
has been updated to reflect the adverse drug reactions 
which are listed in section 4.4 of the SPC. Sections 2 
and 4 of the PL have been updated accordingly.

anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions was presented by the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH). Based on this review 
4 reports of anaphylaxis were identified. In 3 of the 4 reports, 
the likelihood of a causal association between tigecycline 
administration and the onset of anaphylaxis could not be 
excluded. In the fourth report, a temporal and causal 
association was excluded given the onset of anaphylaxis 
occurred 9 days following discontinuation of tigecycline 
administration. Based on this review, the CHMP concluded 
that the cases of anaphylaxia temporally related to the 
administration of tigecycline injections strongly suggested a 
causal relationship and thus section 4.8 of the SPC should be 
updated to include the adverse reaction anaphylactic 
reaction. 
A cumulative review of all study and spontaneous reports of 
thrombocytopenia coincident with tigecycline use was also 
performed by the MAH. Overall, since market launch, there 
have been 27 reports of either thrombocytopenia or platelet 
count decreased coincident with tigecycline administration. 
Twenty reports were from spontaneous sources and 7 
reports were from a study environment. There were 21 
serious reports and 6 non serious reports received. Thus, 
considering the relevant number of reported cases of 
thrombocytopenia, most of them serious, the CHMP 
concluded that a possible causal relationship could not be 
excluded and that thrombocytopenia should be included in 
section 4.8 of the SPC. 
The cumulative information on all spontaneous and study 
cases of pancreatitis submitted by the MAH included 24 
serious and 5 non serious cases (all from studies) of

characteristics of the cases, the CHMP concluded that the

detection of the onset or worsening acute pancreatitis and

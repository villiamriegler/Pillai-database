2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This application is for treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).   
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Lorviqua  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  anaplastic  lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated with an ALK 
inhibitor.  
Epidemiology  
The global incidence of lung cancer was estimated to be 2.1 million new cases in 2018 and non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancer cases1 . Genetic alterations, such as 
the ALK rearrangements are typically found in 3-5% of all NSCLC cases. Patients with ALK-rearranged 
NSCLC have a median 50 years of age at diagnosis and mostly have non- or light-smoking history. 
It is estimated that CNS metastases occur in 20-40% of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who are ALK-
TKI and treatment-naïve. 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ALK is a tyrosine kinase encoded on chromosome 2 and is primarily involved in developmental processes 
and expressed at low levels in adults2. The first genetic rearrangement of ALK seen in NSCLC involved a 
fusion between the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the ALK tyrosine 
kinase domain. EML4-ALK has the capacity to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous 
xenografts to induce tumour formation3. A number of additional ALK fusion partners have been described 
in  NSCLC  that  are  believed  to  result  in  aberrant  signalling  and  oncogenic  transformation 4 , 5 .  ALK 
rearrangements are more common among patients with adenocarcinoma histology, patients who have 
never smoked, and patients who have wild-type EGFR and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene 
homologue (KRAS) 6.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Approximately, one-third of the patients with Stage IIIA disease are considered operable. However, the 
majority  of  patients  with  Stage IIIA/B  have  inoperable  (unresectable)  disease  and  are  amenable  to 
receiving curative intention chemoradiation treatment. The biological characteristics of locally advanced, 
Stage III  disease  are  poorly  defined;  the  clinical  characteristics  associated  with  prognosis  are  nodal 
station involvement, size of primary tumour, baseline pulmonary function, gender, presence or absence 
of significant weight loss, and performance status (PS). 
Pathological diagnosis based on tumour samples includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and cytogenetic analysis by fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation (FISH) test to detect ALK rearrangements. Molecular testing should be carried out to 
determine genetic alterations, such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements which determine 
choice of targeted treatment.  
Management 
Alectinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib are second-generation ALK-TKIs that prolong PFS and have CNS anti-
tumour  effects.  These  therapies  are  recommended  for  treating  patients  with  previously  untreated 
advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, with alectinib being the preferred treatment option in the first-line setting.  
Most  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  derive  clinical  benefit  from  first-line  treatment  with  second-
generation ALK TKIs. However, emergence of resistance mechanisms, including ALK mutations continues 
to  be  a  treatment  challenge.  Therefore,  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  for additional  ALK  TKIs  with 
broader mutational coverage and CNS penetration.   
Lorlatinib is a third-generation, selective, ATP-competitive, brain-penetrant, small molecule inhibitor of 
the ALK tyrosine kinase that was designed to overcome or prevent major mechanisms of resistance that 
develop following previous ALK-inhibitor treatment. It was also designed to penetrate the blood-brain-
barrier. In addition, lorlatinib’ s ability to overcome most known resistance mutations might delay ALK-
dependent mechanisms of resistance. These features indicate that lorlatinib has potential as therapy for 
previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC.    
2.1.2.  About the product 
Lorlatinib  is  a  small  molecule  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI)  and  works  as  a  selective,  adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP)-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of ALK and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) receptor 
tyrosine kinases. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Lorviqua in the following indications (new indication in bold): 
Lorviqua  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not 
treated with an ALK inhibitor.  
Lorviqua  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  ALK-positive  advanced 
NSCLC whose disease has progressed after: 
• 
• 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI.   
Treatment  with  lorlatinib  should  be  initiated  and  supervised  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  use  of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Assessment report  
Page 9/120 
 
 
  
 
Detection  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC  is  necessary  for  selection  of  patients  for  treatment  with  lorlatinib 
because  these  are  the  only  patients  for  whom  benefit  has  been  shown.  Assessment  for  ALK-positive 
NSCLC  should  be  performed  by  laboratories  with  demonstrated  proficiency  in  the  specific  technology 
being utilised. Improper assay performance can lead to unreliable test results. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 100 mg lorlatinib taken orally once daily. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with lorlatinib should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If a dose of Lorviqua is missed, then it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers unless it is 
less  than  4 hours  before  the  next  dose,  in  which  case  the  patient  should  not  take  the  missed  dose. 
Patients should not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. 
Dose modifications 
Dosing  interruption  or  dose  reduction  may  be  required  based  on  individual  safety  and  tolerability. 
Lorlatinib dose reduction levels are summarised below: 
• 
First dose reduction: 75 mg taken orally once daily 
•  Second dose reduction: 50 mg taken orally once daily 
Lorlatinib should be permanently discontinued if the patient is unable to tolerate the 50 mg dose taken 
orally once daily. 
Dose  modification  recommendations  for  toxicities  and  for  patients  who  develop  atrioventricular  (AV) 
block are provided in Table 1 of the SmPC. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The Applicant has generally followed the given advice from the CHMP. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data besides updated ERA documentation have been submitted in this application, 
which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Lorlatinib, the active ingredient in Lorviqua, is a selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of 
ALK and ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinases, that was specifically designed to address mechanisms of 
resistance. Lorlatinib has demonstrated potent and selective inhibitory activity against ALK 
translocations, most known acquired crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, and the ALK mutation that was 
reported in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who developed resistance to previous ALK-TKI 
treatment.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
This Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted as part of the type II variation application dossier 
for Lorviqua (lorlatinib), 25 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets and followed the CHMP guidance 
EMEA/CHMP/ SWP/4447/00 entitled; “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” published 01 June 2006. 
Lorlatinib is an ionisable compound and log Dow values as a function of pH covering an 
environmentally relevant pH-range ranging from pH 5 to 9 were determined. Log Dow values were 
below 4.5 thus lorlatinib had no PBT potential and further PBT assessment was not required. 
When estimating the PECSW, the Fpen was refined to 0.00013 by providing adequately justified 
market penetration data based on published epidemiological data. The PECSW was calculated to 
0.0065 µg/L below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  
Based on the presented data of lorlatinib, no other environmental concerns were apparent, and the 
medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis was not required 
since lorlatinib had no PBT potential and the PECSW was below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

2.2.6.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Lorlatinib was not considered a PBT substance as log D values did not exceed 4.5 at environmentally 
relevant pHs. In addition, PECsurfacewater value was below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of lorlatinib.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Within this application, the Applicant has submitted 5 clinical pharmacology studies (Study B7461001, 
B7461010, B7461017, B7461026 and B7461006). However, study B7461006 is the most relevant 
study due to the population included that corresponds to the proposed new indication. According to 
this, the focus in the pharmacological part of the assessment report was on study B7461006. 
Study  B7461006  is  a  Phase  3,  multinational,  multicentre  (at  approximately  160  sites),  randomized, 
open-label, parallel 2-arm study in which approximately 280 patients with previously untreated advanced 
ALK-positive NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to receive lorlatinib monotherapy or crizotinib monotherapy: 
•  Arm A: Lorlatinib single agent; 
•  Arm B: Crizotinib single agent. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  lorlatinib  as  a  single  agent  (Arm  A)  is 
superior  to  crizotinib  alone  (Arm  B)  in  prolonging  PFS  in  advanced  ALK-positive  NSCLC  patients 
previously not treated with an ALK-inhibitor. Additional objectives included, comparing Arm A and Arm 
B in treatment-naive advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients with respect to OS, evaluating the antitumor 
activity in each treatment arm, and evaluating the safety and tolerability in each treatment arm. 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
In  Study  B7461006,  plasma  concentrations  of  lorlatinib  and  its  major  metabolite  PF-06895751  were 
determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method using a stable isotope labelled internal standard and liquid-
liquid extraction for sample preparation. No new bioanalytical methods were applied.  
In support of Study B7461006, 2135 samples were analysed for lorlatinib in 18 accepted runs within 605 
days  which  is  within  documented  storage  stability  at  -20°C.  Sample  dilution  applied,  10:1.  Incurred 
sample reanalysis was conducted for 216 samples of which 207 were within acceptance criteria. 2121 
samples  were  analysed  for  PF-06895751  (major  human  metabolite  of  lorlatinib)  in  19  accepted  runs 
within  628  days.  4  runs  failed.  Sample  dilution  applied,  20:1.  ISR  was  conducted  on  215  samples  of 
which 199 passed the acceptance criteria. 
Characterization  of  lorlatinib  popPK  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  (Study 
B7461006)  and  subsequent  estimation  of  the  post-hoc  exposure  parameters  was  performed  using 
NONMEM  version  7.4.3  (Icon  Development  Solutions,  Dublin,  Ireland).  PKPD  efficacy  analyses  were 
performed  using  NONMEM  version  7.4.3,  Perl-speaks-NONMEM  (PsN)  version  4.9.0,  and  R  software 
version 3.6.1 or later. The safety analyses was performed using the glm(), clm() and polr() functions in 
R. Simcyp version 17.1 was utilised in the development and verification of a PBPK model for lorlatinib, 
with model extrapolation applied for prediction of metabolic DDIs. 
Population PK model – Study 1006 + other studies 
The previous popPK analysis of lorlatinib included ALK- positive NSCLC patients from one Phase 1/Phase 
2  study  (B7461001),  and  healthy  participants  from  6  clinical  pharmacology  studies  (B7461004, 
B7461005, B7461007, B7461008, B7461011, and B7461016).

The current popPK analysis is a pooled analysis which includes data from the Phase 3 study B7461006, 
which tested lorlatinib versus crizotinib in previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients. 
Plasma samples for determination of plasma concentrations of lorlatinib and its potential metabolite(s) 
were collected at time 0 (pre-dose), and at times between 1 to 4 hours after the lorlatinib dose on Days 
1, 8, and 15 in Cycle 1; and Day 1 in Cycles 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 from patients enrolled in Arm A receiving 
lorlatinib. In the previous popPK model, lorlatinib PK was characterized by a two-compartment model, 
with sequential zero-first order absorption and time-varying clearance. BWT was included a priori in the 
base model, using allometric scaling exponents of 0.75 and 1 on CL and V2 respectively. BALB, WNCL, 
and TDOSE  were significant covariates for CL. PPI  use was a significant covariate for ka. The current 
pooled popPK analysis applied the same structural model and covariates. 
Due to the sparse data of Study B7461001, stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) 
was  used  to  estimate  parameters.  An  expectation  only  importance  sampling  (IMP)  step,  fixed  at  the 
SAEM estimated population parameters was done subsequently to obtain an objective function value. 
The covariate parameters were re-estimated with the expanded dataset. Outliers were identified in the 
final  model  using  the  following  criteria:  CWRES>6  and  IWRES>6  and  the  impact  of  removing  them 
evaluated.  
For the population PK dataset that included Study B7461006 data and reported in PMAR-1941, a listing 
of the excluded data was provided. The following data were excluded: The pre-dose PK concentration, 
prior to the very first dose of lorlatinib. This resulted in 143 PK samples that were excluded from the 
PMAR-1041  analysis,  all  of  which  were  pre-dose  PK  samples  collected  prior  to  the  very  first  dose  of 
lorlatinib on the study.

PBPK model – CYP3A4 interactions 
A minimal PBPK distribution model was developed in Simcyp to simulate the PK of lorlatinib IV. Vsac and 
Q were estimated in Simcyp based on the IV profile after 50 mg lorlatinib (B7461007) where CL was 9.7 
L/h and Vss was 3.58 L/kg. Lorlatinib is an immediate release formulation hence a first order absorption 
model was used and the Fa value was assumed to be 1. The fraction unbound in the intestine (fu,gut) 
was assumed to be equal to the fraction unbound in plasma (fu,plasma),16 which was 0.34. Based on 
lorlatinib  fm  assignments  intrinsic  clearance  values  were  calculated  (Table  4).  Due  to  the  enzyme 
inhibition  and  induction  properties  of  lorlatinib  (both  a  time  dependent  inhibitor  and  an  inducer  of 
CYP3A4,  with  a  net  induction  observed  in  vivo),  the  CYP3A  fm  value  is  non-stationary.  A  sensitivity 
analysis  of  CYP3A4  revealed  that  a  Simcyp  input  of  0.275  for  fm,CYP3A  was  able  to  yield  a  dynamic 
(time-variant) fm,CYP3A of 0.37 and approximates the fm,CYP3A estimated in both Study B74610177 
(fm,CYP3A  =  0.288)  and  B74610046  (fm,CYP3A  =  0.268).  Inhibition  and  induction  parameters 
determined from human hepatocytes were used as Simcyp input parameters for lorlatinib (Table 4).

The lorlatinib PBPK model was  verified using observed PK data obtained from the single and multiple 
ascending  dose  PK  studies  after  oral  administration of  lorlatinib  (Study  B74610013)  and  from  clinical 
DDI studies after oral administration of lorlatinib (Studies B74610013, B74610114, and B74610125).

after select single and multiple oral doses – Method verification data reported in study PF-

The predicted impact matched well the clinically observed PK results after coadministration of a single 
dose  of  100  mg  lorlatinib  on  Day  5  with  multiple  200  mg  QD  doses  of  the  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor 
itraconazole for 11 days. The model predicted an AUC ratio of 1.49 and Cmax ratio of 1.08, which were 
105% and 87% of observed values.  
The  PBPK  model  was  used  for  prediction  of  metabolic  DDIs  with  1)  itraconazole  following  single  and 
multiple dose administration of lorlatinib (75 mg) with multiple doses of itraconazole (200 mg once daily 
[QD]); 2) diltiazem following single and multiple dose administration of lorlatinib (100 mg) with multiple 
doses  of  diltiazem  (60  mg  three  times  a  day  [TID]);  3)  verapamil  following  single  and  multiple  dose 
administration  of  lorlatinib  (100  mg)  with  multiple  doses  of  verapamil  (80  mg  TID);  4)  erythromycin 
following  single  and  multiple  dose  administration  of  lorlatinib  (100  mg)  with  multiple  doses  of 
erythromycin  (500  mg  twice  a  day  [BID]);  5)  fluconazole  following  single  and  multiple  dose 
administration of lorlatinib (100 mg) with multiple doses of fluconazole (200 mg QD); 6) fluvoxamine 
following single and multiple dose administration of (100 mg) with multiple doses of fluvoxamine (100 
mg BID); and 7) fluoxetine following single and multiple dose administration of lorlatinib (100 mg) with 
multiple doses of fluoxetine (20 mg QD). 
All simulations were conducted using a design of 10 trials with 10 subjects using the age range of 20 to 
50 years and 50:50 male to female ratio. Simulations were performed in a virtual population library of 
healthy volunteers supplied by Simcyp® (Sim-Healthy Volunteers).  
Absorption 
Lorlatinib  oral  bioavailability  (F)  was  estimated  to  be  0.74  and  D1  (zero  order  input  duration)  was 
estimated to be 1.09 hrs. The IND (induction rate constant) was estimated to be 0.0136 hr-1, or 0.326 
days-1.

between  the  previously  untreated  patients  from  Study  B7461006  and  the  predominantly  previously 
treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients from Study B7461001 taking 100 mg QD. A trend line

Distribution and Elimination 
Clearance:  
In the popPK analysis, CL after single dose is the clearance prior to auto-induction (CLI=initial clearance 
after single dose), which was estimated to be 8.82 L/hr.   
Lorlatinib clearance after multiple doses increases with time until reaching its maximum value when the 
auto-induction  effect  is  complete,  CLMX=maximum  clearance  value  after  multiple  dosing.  Lorlatinib 
CLMX was estimated to be 14.3 L/hr.  
In the initial MAA submission, the typical values of the final model parameter estimates and the bootstrap 
estimated 95%CI for CLI and CLMX were 9.04 (8.01-10.1) and 14.5 L/h (12.7-16.2), respectively.  
The difference between the initial clearance estimates (predominantly previously treated ALK-positive 
NSCLC patients) and the clearance estimates from the current analysis is less than 10%. This indicates 
that  lorlatinib  PK  in  the  pooled  population  which  includes  patients  from  B7461006,  is  comparable  in 
terms of clearance to the population from the initial MAA submission dataset. Table 7 presents the post-
hoc estimated single dose and steady state lorlatinib CL from the original popPK analysis as well as the 
current analysis, for all NSCLC patients (including data from both B7461001 and B7461006 studies) who 
were receiving the 100 mg QD dosing. 
The typical value for V2 was estimated to be 122 L. The typical value for ka (first-order absorption rate 
constant) was estimated to be 2.30 hr-1.  
In  addition,  V3  (peripheral  volume  of  distribution)  was  estimated  to  be  160 L,  Q  (inter  compartment 
clearance) was estimated to be 21.1 L/hr.  
Table 7. Comparison of post-hoc clearance estimates 
Lorlatinib plasma elimination half-life at steady state was determined using the population PK data.  The 
lorlatinib population PK post-hoc values for individual clearance and volume of distribution were used to 
estimate the steady state plasma elimination half-life (see Table 8) based on the following equations: 
Elimination rate constant (kel) = Clearance/Volume of distribution 
Half-life = ln(2)/kel 
Table 8.

The plasma half-life of lorlatinib after a single 100 mg dose was 23.6 hours, as stated in the SmPC for 
Lorviqua. 
The shorter estimated steady-state population PK-based elimination half-life of 6.17 hours is likely due 
to net lorlatinib auto-induction following multiple dosing. 
In order to provide the most appropriate estimate of the lorlatinib plasma elimination half-life at steady-
state  (post  auto-induction),  the  Applicant  has  calculated  the  steady-state  effective  half-life  of  14.83 
hours based on steady-state clearance (CL) and terminal volume of distribution (Vz) estimates.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  this  application,  only  the  100  mg  QD  dose  was  investigated.  Due  to  auto-induction  (of  P-gp  and 
CYP3A4), the elimination of lorlatinib increases with time as described above.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Table 9 presents the post-hoc estimated single dose and steady-state clearance, as well as steady-state 
Cmax  and  AUCt,  for  cancer  patients  receiving  100  mg  QD  in  the  B7461001  and  B7461006  studies, 
stratified by baseline renal function as defined by the K/DOQI staging. Although there were no patients 
with severe baseline renal impairment, there is a trend of decreasing single and steady state lorlatinib 
CL  with  worsening  impairment  at  baseline.  Correspondingly,  there  is  a  trend  of  increasing  lorlatinib 
steady-state Cmax and AUCt with worsening baseline renal impairment.

Exposure-efficacy models – Study 1006 
E-R results for efficacy endpoints were originally included in the initial MAA submission and were based 
on  data  from  Study  1001,  with  predominantly  pre-treated  ALK+  advanced  NSCLC  patients.  The 
objective of the such analysis was to assess the potential relationship between lorlatinib PK exposure 
(mainly as cumulative AUC) and the objective response rate (ORR) and intracranial objective response 
rate  (IC-ORR);  moreover,  the  analysis  had  the  scope  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  covariates  in  the  E-R 
relationship for the efficacy endpoints ORR and IC-ORR as assessed by independent central review (ICR).  
A brief summary of the main findings of the original final model is shown below for the three populations 
considered for the initial analysis: 
1.  Patients who received prior treatment with any number of ALK-inhibitors (ORR, N=268; IC-ORR, 
N=174).  
- ORR: the variables that were statistically significant predictors of achieving ORR were Asian race, 
baseline  haemoglobin  (BHGB),  number  of  prior  systemic  treatments  (NTHER)  and  maximum 
hypercholesterolemia adverse event Grade ≥2 (CHLGR). The odds of achieving ORR were 2.090 
times higher in Asian patients vs non-Asian, 3.343 times higher for patients with CHLGR ≥2 and 
1.215 times higher for every unit of increase on BHGB. 
- IC-ORR: prior CNS radiation (PRAD), log of BAP (baseline alkaline phosphatise) and BAMY (baseline 
amylase) were statistically predictor of ORR. The odds of achieving ORR were 0.286 times higher 
for patients receiving PRAD vs patients that did not, 0.340 times higher for every 1 unit increase 
in BAP and 1.014 times higher for every unit increase in BAMY. 
2.  Patients who received prior treatment with ≥1 ALK-inhibitors (ORR, N=197; IC-ORR, N=123). 
- ORR: none of the tested predictors, including lorlatinib exposure metric Cmax, P1, were statistically 
significant predictors of achieving ORR. This was not surprising given the homogeneity of the data 
(i.e. all the patients had at least 1 prior ALK inhibitor and were treated with a starting dose of 100 
mg QD lorlatinib). 
- IC-ORR: BAP and BAMY were statistically significant predictors of ORR. The odds of achieving IC-
ORR were 1.015 times higher for every 1 unit increase of BAMY and 0.363 times higher for every 
1 unit increase in BAP. 
3.  Patients who received prior treatment with ≥2 ALK-inhibitors (ORR, N=111; IC-ORR, N=74). 
- ORR: BAMY was a significant predictor of ORR. The odds of achieving ORR were 1.02 times higher 
for every 1 unit increase in BAMY. 
- IC-ORR: This analysis was not conducted due to the low number of patients with evaluable data. 
The original E/R analysis did not show a correlation between lorlatinib exposure and efficacy response in 
terms  of  ORR  and  IC-ORR.  The  reason  could  be  the  high  homogeneity  in  the  population  analysed  in 
particular in terms of dose. Also, it was not possible to conclude that the covariates considered significant 
in the analysis are effectively useful to predict the response. The potential relationship between lorlatinib 
exposure and PFS was not characterized due to the small number of events at time of the initial MAA 
submission.

An  updated  E-R  analysis  for  efficacy  endpoints,  including  previously  untreated  patients  from  Study 
1006, has been provided within the current application and is hereinafter discussed. 
The dataset included all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population in Study B7461006 (N=149 
from  the  lorlatinib  arm  and  N=147  from  the  crizotinib  arm).  The  E-R  analyses  were  performed  using 
PFS, ORR, and IC-ORR as the efficacy endpoints. Only patients from the lorlatinib arm who had baseline 
CNS  metastasis  were  included  in  the  E-R  analysis  for  IC-ORR  (N=38).  Time-to-event  data  was 
summarized using median, low, and high percentiles. 
The  PFS  analysis  was  conducted  using  parametric  time-to-event  (TTE)  models.  Several  survival 
distribution  functions  were  evaluated  including  Weibull  and  exponential  models  where  a  log-normal 
hazard distribution best described the PFS data.  
Table 17. Run log for tested hazard distributions in patients randomized to the lorlatinib arm 
Lorlatinib  steady-state  exposure  metrics  were  evaluated  in  the  PFS  base  model  using  a  univariate 
approach and it was determined that the best exposure metric was predicted maximum concentration 
up to Cycle 1 Day 15 (Cmax ss). However, for the exposure-PFS analysis for patients in the lorlatinib 
arm,  lorlatinib  Cmax  ss  was  not  significantly  associated  with  PFS  in  both  univariate  and  multivariate 
regression  models.  In  the  final  PFS  model,  higher  baseline  albumin  (BALB)  and  higher  baseline  body 
weight (BWT) were associated with higher probability of longer PFS. Model evaluation was based on the 
likelihood ratio test, condition number and precision of the parameter estimates. TTE VPCs were used to 
compare simulated to observed Kaplan-Meier survival curves.  
Table 18. Final model parameter estimates for PFS patients in the lorlatinib arm 
The modelling analyses for ORR and IC-ORR were performed using binomial logistic regression models. 
For each of the exploratory analyses for ORR and IC-ORR, Cmax ss was identified as the best exposure 
metric. In the final model for ORR, none of the tested covariates, including lorlatinib exposure metric 
Cmax ss, were statistically significant predictors of achieving ORR after backward covariate elimination. 
The c-index or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the

model’s  ability  to  identify  individuals  with  different  risks  of  the  target  event  and  evaluate  the  model 
performance. 
Table 19. ORR: Lorlatinib exposure metric selection 
Table 20. IC-ORR: Lorlatinib exposure metric selection 
In the final model for IC-ORR, only male sex was identified as a significant predictor for achieving IC-
ORR. Due to the unequal distribution of sex (10 male, 28 female), low number of patients in this analysis 
set (N=38), and the overall high proportion of positive IC-ORR in the lorlatinib arm 66%, these analyses 
should be interpreted with caution. 
The  population  PK  model  provided  good  predictive  performance  up  to  360  hours  after  the  start  of 
lorlatinib treatment (Figure 6. Visual Predictive Check for the First 1300 hours).

The vertical dashed red line demarcates 360 hours post the first lorlatinib dose, which is equivalent to 24 hours post Cycle 1 Day 15 
dose. The solid black line represents the 50th percentile of the observed data. The dashed red lines represent the 5th and 95th 
percentiles of the observed data. The blue ribbon represents the 90% CI of the 50th percentile of the simulated data. The red 
ribbons represent the 90% CI of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated data. 
1006=Study B7461006. 
As pre-specified in the Population Modeling Analysis Plan, an agnostic approach was used to select the 
most  appropriate  Cycle  1,  Day  15  (C1D15)  lorlatinib  exposure  metrics  to  evaluate  in  the  exposure-
response (E-R) analyses for efficacy. For the purpose of the analyses in PMAR-EQDD-B746e-sNDA-1050, 
the exposure metrics considered were predicted maximum concentration up to Cycle 1 Day 15 (Cmax ss), 
predicted  concentration  prior  to  Cycle  1  Day  16  lorlatinib  dose  (Ctrough  ss),  and  predicted  average 
concentration calculated as the ratio of AUCtau over 24 hours (Cavg ss). 
Although Cmax ss was determined to be the most appropriate exposure metric, the difference in OFV was 
only  slightly  better  for  Cmax,ss  compared  to  other  metrics,  e.g.,  Ctrough,ss  and  Caverage,ss  since  all  of  the 
lorlatinib exposure metrics evaluated were all correlated (>50%). (Figure 7).  To confirm that the choice 
of the lorlatinib exposure metric would not change the results, the E-R analyses for efficacy (PFS, ORR, 
and  ORR-IC)  endpoints  were  re-run  using  the  exposure  metrics  Ctrough  ss  and  Cavg  ss.  The  results  are 
presented below in Table 21 and Table 22, which confirm that these results are consistent with those 
reported in PMAR-EQDD-B746e-sNDA-1050, which used the exposure metric Cmax,ss.

Exposure-safety models – pooled analysis Study 1006 and Study 1001 
Lorlatinib exposure metrics were derived from the final popPK model. Data from the Phase 3 B7461006 
study in previously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients (N=149), in combination with the 
data  from  the  Phase  1/2  B7461001  study  in  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  (N=331)  was  used  to 
evaluate the relations between lorlatinib exposure and a number of safety endpoints.  
Studies’ summary description 
•  Study  1006:  phase  3,  randomized,  parallel  2-arms,  open-label  study.  As  a  primary  objective,  it 
investigated the superiority of lorlatinib (Arm A: 100 mg QD as monotherapy) vs crizotinib (Arm B: 
250 mg BID as monotherapy) in prolonging PFS in 296 previously untreated ALK+ NSCLC patients. 
It also investigated the safety and tolerability in each treatment arm. 
•  Study 1001: phase 1/2, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalation study. It investigated safety, PK, 
PD  and  efficacy  of  lorlatinib  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  ALK+  or  ROS1+  NSCLC 
previously treated with other ALK-inhibitors.  
- Phase 1 part estimated the MTD for lorlatinib in dose escalation cohorts (10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 
and 200 mg QD) and enrolled 55 patients. Although not initially planned, 25, 35, 50 and 75 mg 
BID dosing regimens were investigated due to the occurrence of (DLTs). 
- Phase 2 part evaluated the anti-cancer activity of lorlatinib in multiple subpopulations of patients 
and allowed a better definition of the safety, efficacy, PK and PD profiles of lorlatinib at 100 mg 
QD recommended dose. 
For  both  studies,  the  safety  endpoints  were  defined  using  standardized  search  criteria  following  the 
Standard  MedDRA  Query,  HLGTs,  HLTs  and/or  PTs.  The  safety  outcomes  of  interest  were  graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) 
v.4.03 severity grade. TEAEs grade ≥3 were also analyzed.  
Assessment report  
Page 36/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
E-R relationships were modelled for safety endpoints that occurred in at least 10% of patients, which 
included Hypercholesterolemia Grade ≥3, Hypertriglyceridemia Grade ≥3, Weight Gain Grade ≥2, and 
TEAE  Grade  ≥3  using  binomial  logistic  regression.  The  same  exposure-safety  relationships  were  also 
investigated using ordinal logistic regression models to investigate the grade of a safety event. 
Table 23. Potential predictors of response 
Covariates initially deemed clinically relevant or deemed potentially relevant after graphically inspection 
were initially included and excluded from the full model based on stepwise backwards elimination except 
for the exposure metric. The goodness-of-fit, c-index and ROC curves were used to assess the models. 
Below are the final model parameters of the binomial logistic regression analyses for the four modelled 
safety endpoints (Table 24, Table 25,Table 26, Table 27). The  final parameters of the ordinal logistic 
regression models are not shown since the logistic regression models serve as the primary analysis.

Exposure-response-relationship 
Efficacy E-R relationship results 
The observed efficacy results in terms of PFS and ORR for patients in the overall population and IC-ORR 
for patients with intracranial metastases at baseline for Study 1006 are shown in the following table. 
The following table summarizes the exposure metrics derived for patients in Study 1006 who received 
at least 1 dose of lorlatinib and had PK information available. 
Below figure shows the observed PFS for patients in Study 1006. The blue, yellow, grey and red lines 
represent  patients  in  the  lorlatinib  arm  stratified  by  exposure  quartiles  (Cycle  1  Day  15  average 
concentration) and the light blue line represents patients in the crizotinib arm. The median PFS in the 
crizotinib arm was 9.3 months (95% CI: 7.6, 11.1 months) and the median PFS was not reached in any 
of the lorlatinib exposure quartiles. Lorlatinib exposure quartiles, in terms of Cmax ss, mostly overlap and

the highest exposure quartile 4 (median 853 ng/mL [range 752-1286 ng/mL]) may be associated with 
slightly  shorter  PFS  compared  to  quartiles  1-3  (median 465 ng/mL  [range 0-528 ng/mL],  591  ng/mL 
[range 530-644 ng/mL], and 696 ng/mL [range 647-746 ng/mL]. Similar trends were observed for other 
lorlatinib steady-state exposure metrics (i.e. Ctrough ss and Cavg ss). Therefore, the analyses intended to 
quantify any potential relationships between PFS and possible covariates, including lorlatinib exposure.

Safety E-R relationship - results 
Results from the assessment of exposure-response relationship for safety endpoints were included in the 
submission of the initial MAA and were based on data from Study 1001 with predominantly pretreated 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients. An updated E-R analysis for safety, pooling the individuals from 
Studies 1001  and  1006  was  conducted.  E-R  relationships  were  analysed  using  binomial  logistic 
regression for safety endpoints that occurred in at least 10% of patients, which included: 
•  Hypercholesterolemia Grade ≥3 
•  Hypertriglyceridemia Grade ≥3 
•  Weight gain Grade ≥2 (defined as the PT Weight increased) 
• 
TEAE Grade ≥3 
The same E-R relationships were also analysed using ordinal logistic regression. These same endpoints 
were modelled in the previously submitted lorlatinib E-R safety analysis. 
The E-R analysis included 480 patients treated with lorlatinib from Study B7461006 (N=149) and Study 
B7461001 (N=331).

Hypercholesterolemia 
No E-R relationship was identified for Hypercholesterolemia Grade ≥3 with lorlatinib plasma exposure 
metrics. None of the PK exposure metrics met significance indeed.

The binomial logistic regression results indicated that patients with higher baseline cholesterol were more 
likely to experience Grade ≥3 Hypercholesterolemia.

The ordinal logistic regression results found the same directional relationship with baseline cholesterol, 
and also found female patients or patients who have had prior radiation treatment were more likely to 
experience higher grades of hypercholesterolemia. 
Hypertriglyceridemia 
No  E-R  relationship  was  identified  for  Hypertriglyceridemia  Grade  ≥3  with  lorlatinib  plasma  exposure 
metrics:  
The binomial logistic regression results indicate patients with higher log-transformed baseline 
triglycerides, higher baseline albumin, or were of Asian race were more likely to experience Grade ≥3 
hypertriglyceridemia.  
Assessment report  
Page 43/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The ordinal logistic regression results found the same directional relationships, indicating patients with 
the aforementioned factors were more likely to experience higher grades of hypertriglyceridemia. 
Weight Gain 
No clinically meaningful E-R relationship was identified for weight gain Grade ≥2 with lorlatinib plasma 
exposure metrics: 
The binomial logistic regression results indicate patients who were younger, were from Study 1006, or 
had  taken  concomitant  narcotics  were  more  likely  to  experience  Grade  ≥2  weight  gain.  The  ordinal 
logistic regression results found the same directional relationships for age and Study, indicating younger 
patients or patients from Study 1006 were more likely to experience higher grades of weight gain.  
Assessment report  
Page 44/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The retained Study covariate in both binomial and ordinal logistic regression weight gain analyses are 
consistent with the observed data, as a higher percentage of patients in Study 1006 experienced weight 
gain Grade ≥2 than patients in Study 1001. 
An E-R relationship was identified for Grade ≥3 TEAE:  
The  binomial  logistic  regression  results  indicated  patients  with  higher  Cave  SD,  were  older,  took 
concomitant  narcotics,  took  concomitant  steroids,  or  were  from  Study  1006  were  more  likely  to 
experience Grade ≥3 TEAE.  
The ordinal logistic regression results found the same directional relationships, indicated patients with 
the aforementioned factors were more likely to experience higher grades of TEAE. 
The positive relationship between lorlatinib plasma Cave SD and Grade ≥3 TEAE observed in the current 
analysis  is  consistent  with  the  previously  submitted  lorlatinib  E-R  safety  analysis,  where  a  positive 
relationship was identified with lorlatinib plasma exposure. This is consistent with the current lorlatinib 
label, which has instructions for handling drug-related Grade ≥3 TEAE.  
Assessment report  
Page 45/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Finally, as seen with the weight gain safety endpoint, the retained study covariate in both binomial and 
ordinal logistic regression TEAE analyses were consistent with the observed data, as a higher percentage 
of patients in Study 1006 experienced Grade ≥3 TEAE than patients in Study 1001. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Within this application, the MAH has submitted 5 clinical pharmacology studies (Study B7461001, 
B7461010, B7461017, B7461026 and B7461006). However, only the new study, study B7461006, is 
the most relevant study due to the population included that corresponds to the proposed new 
indication: “Lorviqua as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated 
with an ALK inhibitor.” According to this, the focus in the pharmacological part of the assessment 
report was on study B7461006.  
Plasma concentrations of lorlatinib and its major metabolite PF-06895751 were determined by a 
validated LC-MS/MS method in study B7461006. The overall accuracy and precision of the method 
performance was acceptable. The in-study validation of bioanalysis conducted in Study B7461006 is 
endorsed. A previous 2-compartment model with time-varying clearance and a sequential zero-first 
order absorption which included lorlatinib data from several studies with dense sampling was pooled 
with the sparse data from study B7461006 in patients that received lorlatinib (Arm A). The goodness-
of fit plots, visual predictive checks (VPC) and parameter estimates were acceptable and did not 
indicate any major misspecifications. None of the confidence intervals (bootstrap n=1000) for the 
structural parameter estimates or covariate effects contained the null. The inter-individual variability 
(IIV) was less well described, especially for volumes and ka.  
The final popPK model included data from the previously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC 
patients (Study 1006), in addition to data presented in the final popPK model of the initial MAA 
submission from previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients (Study 1001), and healthy 
participants (Studies 1004, 1005, 1007, 1008, 1011 and 1016). No additional covariate screening was 
done as the distribution of patient demographics as well as the observed concentrations were similar 
between the populations considered. However, the covariate parameters were re-estimated with the 
expanded dataset. The typical values differed by less than 10%, so the estimates were deemed 
sufficiently similar. Lorlatinib exposure estimates were used in the subsequent E-R and E-S analyses. 
In a post hoc analysis, performed by the MAH, the Applicant has determined the lorlatinib plasma 
elimination half-life at steady state, using the PK data. It was estimated to be 6.17 hours. In current 
SmPC section 5.2, the reported elimination half-life of 23.6 hours represents the half-life after a single 
dose 100 mg. As lorlatinib is both a substrate and a net inducer of CYP3A4, and is supposed to be 
administered at 100 mg daily, it is found relevant to report the estimated elimination half-life at steady 
state, in the updated SmPC. The MAH has additionally reported the more appropriate estimate of the 
lorlatinib plasma elimination half-life at steady state (post auto-induction) of 14.83 hours within the 
SmPC section 5.2, which is considered acceptable.  
The PK parameters estimates in the current popPK differ less than 10% of those estimated in the 
original popPK model and this can suggest that the inclusion of the previously untreated ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC patients in Study 1006 does not have a significant impact on PK parameters 
estimation. However, as already noted in the original popPK model, the shrinkage for some of the 
estimated lorlatinib PK parameters is higher than recommended and parameters were estimated with 
high variability. The MAH claimed that the sparse PK data collection in study 1006 contributed to the 
high shrinkage, but in this case, the shrinkage in CL is higher than in the previous model (35% vs 
23%). The higher shrinkage in CL could have contributed to the overprediction of simulated 
Assessment report  
Page 46/120 
 
 
  
 
concentrations as showed by the VPC, in particular at 50th and 95th percentiles. However, for 
estimation of the steady-state exposure (used for ER analysis), only data through Day 15 (360 hours) 
were used and did not include the model predictions at the later time points when overprediction was 
noted in the VPCs. In the VPC presented, predictions before 360 hours seem more in line with 
observed data, in particularly for the 50th percentile.  
There is an observed trend of increasing lorlatinib steady-state Cmax and AUCt with worsening 
baseline renal impairment, which is in accordance with the performed clinical study B7461010. 
Therefore, it seems relevant to acknowledge this trend, and to mention this within the SmPC: 
“Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that lorlatinib steady state plasma exposure and 
Cmax values slightly increase with worsening baseline renal function.” 
Moreover, it was shown that lorlatinib plasma exposures, (i.e. AUC and Cmax), are comparable at both 
steady-state, and after single dose administration, across different levels of hepatic function (i.e. 
normal, mild, moderate hepatic function). Only the AUCtau, on the level of moderate hepatic 
impairment seems to decrease significantly, compared to normal hepatic function. However, only one 
individual was included in the moderate hepatic impairment group, so the results should be interpreted 
with caution.  
A PBPK model was developed in Simcyp for simulation of lorlatinib CYP3A4 DDI. Lorlatinib is both a 
substrate and a net inducer of CYP3A4. Even the PBPK model seems to capture this complex effect, it 
was never verified by clinical data since the clinical DDI study with itraconazole was performed with a 
single dose of lorlatinib. Therefore, the PBPK model simulations are not acceptable for SmPC 
recommendations and should be interpreted with caution. 
An updated E-R analysis for efficacy with previously untreated patients from Study 1006 was 
conducted to evaluate the relationship between lorlatinib exposure and the efficacy endpoint PFS, as 
this was the primary efficacy endpoint analyzed in Study 1006. Exploratory analyses for ORR and IC-
ORR were also conducted. All patients randomized to lorlatinib in study 1006 were included in the 
analyses for PFS and ORR (N=149), while only patients from the lorlatinib arm who had baseline CNS 
metastasis were included in the E-R analysis for IC-ORR (N=38).   
Baseline body weight and baseline albumin were the only significant covariates associated with PFS in 
the E-R efficacy time to event (TTE) analysis; higher baseline albumin and higher baseline body weight 
were associated with higher probability of longer PFS. It is known that low albumin levels and low body 
weight are in general poor prognostic factors for outcome in patients with cancer. The highest lorlatinib 
exposure quartile (Q4) had lower baseline body weight and baseline albumin compared to quartiles 1-3 
(Q1, Q2, and Q3) (data not shown). Therefore, the apparent relationship observed in Figure 8 is likely 
confounded by the uneven distribution of established predictive variables across the exposure 
quartiles.  
No E-R relationship was identified between lorlatinib plasma exposure and PFS, indeed both univariate 
and multivariate regression models did not point-out a significant association between Cmax ss and 
such efficacy endpoint. Following an exploratory analysis, no E-R relationship was found between 
lorlatinib exposure and ORR/IC-ORR and this is consistent with the original E-R analysis provided for 
ALK+ NSCLC patients who received lorlatinib after previous treatment with other ALK inhibitors. For 
characterization of ORR and IC-ORR binomial logistic regression models were used. For ORR, no 
covariates were significant. For IC-ORR, only male sex was identified as being significant but this result 
should be interpreted with caution due to limited and unbalanced data in patients with baseline CNS 
metastasis. 
Finally, the MAH provided an updated E-R analysis for safety, pooling data derived from studies 1001, 
in which different lorlatinib doses were used, and 1006, where only the 100 mg dose was 
Assessment report  
Page 47/120 
 
 
  
 
administered. E-R relationships were analysed using both binomial and ordinal logistic regression for 
safety endpoints that occurred in at least 10% of patients, which included hypercholesterolemia Grade 
≥3, hypertriglyceridemia Grade ≥3, weight gain Grade ≥2 (defined as the PT Weight increased) and 
TEAE Grade ≥3. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and weight gain did not demonstrate 
clinically meaningful relationships with lorlatinib plasma exposures, while Grade ≥3 TEAE 
demonstrated a positive relationship with lorlatinib plasma exposure. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In  conclusion,  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  within  this  application  overall  support  the  use  of  the 
proposed dose in the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study B7461006 (CROWN) 
The pivotal study B7461006 (also referred to as Study 1006 or CROWN) is a Phase 3, multinational, 
multicentre, open-label study. In total, 296 participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio and no cross-
over was allowed. Enrolment was closed on 28 February 2019.

advanced ALK-positive NSCLC participants who are treatment naïve. 
Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare lorlatinib and crizotinib in treatment naïve advanced ALK-positive NSCLC participants 
with respect to OS; 
To evaluate the antitumor activity in each treatment arm; 
To  evaluate  PROs  of  health-related  quality  of  life,  disease/treatment  related  symptoms  of  lung 
cancer, and general health status for each treatment arm; 
To evaluate candidate biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to single agent crizotinib or lorlatinib 
in peripheral blood.

secondary endpoints were controlled by multiplicity. 
Sample size 
Approximately 280 participants (140 in each arm) were to be randomized using a 1:1 ratio stratified by 
presence of brain metastases and ethnic origin. A total of 177 PFS events were required to have at least 
90% power to detect a HR of 0.611 using a one-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 
Assessment report  
Page 51/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
0.025 (one-sided), and a 2-look group-sequential design with a Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) alpha-
spending function to determine the efficacy boundaries. 
The planned sample size was determined based on the assumption of a HR of 0.611 under the alternative 
hypothesis (under an exponential model, assuming median PFS of 11 months in the crizotinib arm and 
18  months  in  the  lorlatinib  arm).  The  sample  size  further  assumed  a  15%  drop-out  rate  within  each 
treatment  arm  at  30  months,  a  non-uniform  participant  accrual  over  approximately  15  months,  and 
follow-up after the last participant was randomized of approximately 18 months. 
The sample size also allowed comparison of OS between the 2 treatment arms, provided that superiority 
of lorlatinib over crizotinib with respect to PFS had been demonstrated. If the true HR was 0.70 under 
the  alternative  hypothesis  (under  an  exponential  model,  assuming  median  OS  of  48  months  on  the 
crizotinib arm and 68.6 months on the lorlatinib arm), a total of 198 deaths were required to have 70% 
power using a one-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided), and a 3-look 
group-sequential design with Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) alpha-spending function to determine the 
efficacy boundaries. These calculations further assumed a 15% drop-out rate for OS on either treatment 
arm  at  120  months,  and  a  follow-up  of  approximately  110  months  after  the  last  participant  was 
randomized. 
Randomisation 
Patients were to be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive lorlatinib or crizotinib. Randomization was to 
be  stratified  by  presence  of  brain  metastases  (Yes  vs.  No)  and  ethnic  origin  (Asian  vs.  non-Asian). 
Presence of brain metastases at baseline is considered an important prognostic factor. Ethnic origin is 
not expected to be predictive or prognostic and this is best conformed by using this as a stratification 
factor. The stratified randomization was centrally allocated across all centres via the interactive response 
technology (IRT) system.  
Blinding (masking) 
This study was open-label and ongoing at the time of data cut-off. The BICR and the sponsor’s study 
team were blinded to the randomized treatment. 
Participants  who  developed  radiological  disease  progression  confirmed  by  BICR  assessment  but  were 
otherwise continuing to derive clinical benefit from study treatment were eligible to continue with the 
treatment they were assigned to, provided that the treating physician determined that the benefit/risk 
for doing so was favourable. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not permitted. 
Statistical methods 
Full Analysis Set 
The full analysis (FA) set will include all patients who are randomized. Patients will be classified according 
to the treatment assigned at randomization. Randomized but not treated patients will be reported under 
their randomized treatment group for the full analysis set. The FA set will be the primary population for 
evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient.  
Primary Endpoint: Progression-free Survival as Assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1 
Assessment report  
Page 52/120 
 
 
  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will compare PFS based on BICR assessment between the experimental 
arm and the control arm, and will be performed using a one-sided stratified log-rank test. The treatment 
effect  will  be  estimated  using  a  Cox’s  Proportional  Hazard  model  stratified  by  presence  of  brain 
metastases and ethnic origin at randomization to calculate the hazard ratio. Kaplan-Meier estimates will 
be presented by treatment arm together with a summary of associated statistics including the median 
PFS time with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI). The PFS rate at 12 months will be estimated 
with corresponding two-sided 95%CIs.  
Table 31. Outcome and event dates for PFS analyses 
Sensitivity Analyses for PFS as Assessed by BICR 
These  analyses  are  regarded  as  purely  exploratory.  The  sensitivity  analyses  will  repeat  the  primary 
analysis (p-value, HR and 95% CIs) on the FA with the modifications below: 
• 
• 
• 
PFS  based  on  BICR  assessment  and  counting  all  PDs  and  deaths  as  events  regardless  of  missing 
assessments or timing of the event (ie, not censoring due to start of new anti-cancer therapy prior 
to event or due to missed assessments). 
PFS based on BICR assessment using an unstratified analysis. 
PFS  based  on  BICR  assessment  analysed  with  stratified  analysis  using  the  two  randomization 
stratification factors and baseline ECOG PS value from the CRF. 
•  Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models will also be used to explore the potential influences of 
baseline patient characteristics (such as age, gender, ethnic origin, presence of brain metastasis at 
baseline based on BICR intracranial assessment, smoking status, ECOG performance status, extent 
of disease, histology, etc.) on PFS. 
Secondary endpoint: OS 
The  primary  analysis  of  OS  will  compare  the  OS  time  between  the  experimental  arm  and  the  control 
arm,  and  will  be  performed  using  a  one-sided  stratified  log-rank  test.  The  treatment  effect  will  be 
estimated using a Cox’s Proportional Hazard model stratified by the randomization strata to calculate 
the hazard ratio.   
OS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan- Meier method. CIs 
for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles will be reported. The Cox proportional hazards model will be 
fitted to compute the treatment HRs and the corresponding 95% CIs. 
Censoring reasons are as follows: 
Assessment report  
Page 53/120 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Alive; 
•  Withdrawal of consent; 
• 
Lost to follow-up (Includes subjects deemed to be lost to follow-up by the Investigator and subjects 
with last follow-up >365 days prior to data cut off date). 
Sensitivity Analyses for OS  
These  analyses  are  regarded  as  purely  exploratory.  The  sensitivity  analyses  will  repeat  the  primary 
analysis (p-value, HR and 95% CIs) on the FA with the modifications below: 
•  OS using an unstratified analysis. 
•  OS with stratified analysis using the two randomization stratification factors and baseline ECOG 
PS value from the CRF. 
•  Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models will also be used to explore the potential influences 
of baseline patient on OS. The same methodology described for PFS will be used for OS. 
Secondary endpoint: Objective Response 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall confirmed 
response of CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1. Patients without documented CR or PR will be considered 
as non-responders. The evaluation of ORR will be provided both based on BICR and Investigator and will 
be relative to the FA population.  
The ORR on each treatment arm will be estimated by dividing the number of patients with OR (CR or 
PR) by the number of patients randomized to the respective treatment arm. The corresponding exact 2-
sided 95% CIs will be provided. OR comparison between the 2 treatment arms will be assessed using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test using the stratification factors and risk ratio and the corresponding 
2-sided 95% CI will be provided as well.  
Interim analyses and multiplicity considerations 
The original study design has been revised to have a PFS interim analysis for efficacy and a PFS final 
analysis. The interim analysis will be performed after approximately 133 (75%) PFS events have been 
documented by BICR assessment. The final analysis for PFS will occur when 177 PFS events have been 
documented by BICR, if the efficacy boundary has not been crossed at the interim analysis. Follow-up 
for OS will continue and a final OS analysis is planned to be performed when 198 deaths have occurred. 
The nominal significance levels for the interim and final efficacy analyses of PFS will be determined by 
using  the  Lan-DeMets  procedure  with  an  O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  boundary.  The  overall  significance 
level will be preserved at 0.025 (one-sided). 
As  the  observed  number  of  events  at  the  interim  analysis  may  not  be  exactly  equal  to  the  planned 
number  of  events,  the  efficacy  boundaries  will  be  updated  based  on  the  actual  number  of  observed 
events using the pre-specified α-spending functions. 
The secondary OS endpoint will be analysed using a hierarchical testing procedure, provided the primary 
PFS endpoint is statistically significant favouring the experimental arm. An α-spending function according 
to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) will be used to preserve the 0.025 overall level of significance and the 
repeated testing of the OS hypotheses at the interim and final analyses. The trial allows for the stopping 
of the study for a superior OS result, provided the primary PFS endpoint has already been shown to be 
statistically significant. 
A maximum of three analyses are planned for OS: 
Assessment report  
Page 54/120 
 
 
  
 
1.  A  first  interim  analysis  at  the  time  of  the  interim/final  PFS  analysis  (at  the  one  that  exceeded  the 
efficacy boundary); 
2. A second interim analysis when 139 deaths (70% of the total events planned for final OS analysis) 
are observed; 
3. A final analysis when 198 deaths are observed. 
The exact nominal p-values that will need to be observed to declare statistical significance at the time 
of these analyses for OS will depend on the number of OS events that have been observed at the time 
of these analyses and the α for OS already spent at the time of earlier analyses. 
Changes to the SAP and the planned analyses 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for study  B7461006 is based on the protocol amendment 4 dated 
04OCT2019. 
Table 32. Summary of major changes in SAP amendments 
Sensitivity analyses of OS and analysis of PFS2 that were prespecified have not been performed at the 
current stage due to immaturity in these endpoints.

a. One single patient with locally advanced disease at study entry was staged according to AJCC v8.0, instead of AJCC v7.0 as 
required by protocol, therefore classified under other.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: PFS by BIRC  
The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS by BIRC was met and statistically significantly improved at the 
first IA performed after 127 PFS events (72% of the 177 events planned at the final analysis of PFS) 
and occurred as of the data cut-off date of 20 March 2020. The median PFS follow-up duration was 
18.3 months (95%CI: 16.4., 20.1) in the lorlatinib arm and 14.8 months (95%CI: 12.8, 18.4) in the 
crizotinib arm.

Table 53. Summary of intra-cranial duration of response based on BICR Assessment 
(modified RECIST v1.1) – Patients with brain metastases at baseline and confirmed CR or

In participants with any baseline brain metastases who had confirmed CR or PR, the median IC-TTRs 
(Q1, Q3) were similar between treatment arms, with 1.9 months (1.8, 3.7) in the lorlatinib arm and 1.8 
months (1.7, 2.7) in the crizotinib arm, which was about the time of the first tumor assessment scan. 
PRO – Patient-reported outcomes 
The PRO results are presented in detail for the first 18 cycles. Later cycles had a smaller (approximately 
≤20%) number of participants in each arm, which limited the interpretation of the data. At baseline, all 
participants  who  were  eligible  to  complete  the  questionnaires  (EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-LC13) 
answered at least 1 question. The percentage of participants who completed at least one question was 
≥96% through Cycle 18 in both treatment arms. The completion rate for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 
was similar to the completion rates of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 Functional and Symptoms Scales 
Mean baseline scores in global QoL were 64.6 (SE ±1.82) in the lorlatinib arm and 59.8 (SE ±1.90) in 
the crizotinib arm.  
• 
There  was  a  numerical  improvement  from  baseline  in  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global  QoL  in  the 
lorlatinib  arm  compared  with  the  crizotinib  arm  (estimated  mean  difference  of  4.65  [95%CI: 
1.14, 8.16]. 
•  Global  QoL  improvements  in  mean  change  from  baseline  were  seen  as  early  as  Cycle  2  and 
maintained over time in the lorlatinib arm (Figure 14). 
Assessment report  
Page 74/120 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  (≥10  points  difference)  or  notable  numerical  differences 
between treatment arms in any EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning domain. 
The proportion of participants with improvement (≥10-point change from baseline) or stable in 
EORTC QLQ-C30 global QoL was similar between the lorlatinib arm (41.8% and 39.7%, 
respectively) and crizotinib arm (42.6% and 38.2%, respectively).

Biomarker analysis 
ALK status was determined by the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx IHC test performed on the Ventana ULTRA 
or  XT  platforms.  Participants  were  enrolled  based  on  the  presence  of  an  ALK  gene  rearrangement  as 
determined  by  local  or  central  Ventana  ALK  (D5F3)  CDx  IHC  testing  of  their  archived  tumour  tissue. 
Screening plasma CNA samples were retrospectively analysed at a central laboratory (Guardant Health) 
utilizing  the  G360  IUO  assay  on  samples  from  enrolled  participants  and  therefore  known  to  be  ALK 
positive based on IHC result.

Table 54. Summary of patients with none vs. ≥ 1 ALK mutation at screening – Tumour tissue 
analysis set (Protocol B7461006) 
A total of 122 and 123 participants in the Lorlatinib and Crizotinib Arms, respectively, had valid results 
for  assessment  of  plasma  genotyping  (i.e.,  included  participants’  ALK  gene  rearrangement  status  by 
blood-based Guardant Health G360 IUO test) (Table 55). 
ALK gene rearrangement were detected: 
- In the Lorlatinib Arm, 59 (48.4%; 95% CI: 39.2, 57.6). 
- In the Crizotinib Arm, 62 (50.4%; 95% CI: 41.2, 59.5). 
ALK gene arrangement were not detected: 
- In the Lorlatinib Arm, 63 (51.6%). 
- In the Crizotinib Arm, 61 (49.6%).

*OS data immature, final OS data will be provided as an Annex II condition. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Follow-up efficacy from the EXP-1 cohort of the Phase 1/2 Study 1001 are included for completeness. 
However, the development phase and study designs were different between Study 1001 and Study 1006.  
Study 1001  was  a  Phase 1/2  uncontrolled  trial  for  estimating  antitumor  activity  in  participants  with 
several disease characteristics. The EXP-1 cohort focused on patients with previously untreated advanced 
NSCLC and was limited to 30 participants. Phase 3 Study 1006 is a randomized study of 296 participants 
with an active control arm. 
Given the limited sample size and the uncontrolled design of the EXP-1 cohort in Phase 1/2 Study 1001, 
comparative statements to the Phase 3 Study 1006 were not deemed appropriate and pooled analyses 
were not prepared. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly  (≥ 65 years):  Due  to  the  limited  data  on  this  population,  no  dose  recommendation  can  be 
made for patients aged 65 years and older.   
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is needed for patients with normal renal function and mild or 
moderate  (CLcr: ≥ 30mL/min)  renal  impairment  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis. 
Information  for  lorlatinib  use  in  patients  with  severe  (CLcr:  < 30 mL/min)  renal  impairment  is  very 
limited. Therefore, lorlatinib is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic  impairment:  No  dose  adjustments  are  recommended  for  patients  with  mild  hepatic 
impairment.  No  information  is  available  for  lorlatinib  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic 
impairment.  Therefore,  lorlatinib  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2).

are provided.  The EXP-1 cohort included previously untreated participants with advanced ALK-positive 
NSCLC with or without CNS metastases (N=30). Participants with baseline CNS metastases had to be 
clinically asymptomatic. All participants received 100 mg QD lorlatinib as the starting dose.

Real-world data - Post-second generation ALK TKI setting 
As  part  the  current  application,  the  MAH  proposed  to  downgrade  the  specific  obligation  to  conduct  a 
single arm study in patients who progressed after alectinib or ceritinib to a recommendation and convert 
the conditional MA to a full MA based on efficacy, safety and mutational analysis data from Phase 3 Study 
B7461006 in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.  
To  support  this  claim,  real  world  efficacy  data  were  also  submitted  from  new  additional  32  patients 
progressing on or after one second-generation ALK TKI with or without prior chemotherapy from three 
recent publications of real-world datasets: 
Two  real-world  data  sets  were  derived  from  the  Early  Access  Program  (EAP)  for  lorlatinib  in  Austria 
(Hochmair et al.) and Russia (Orlov et al.). To participate in the EAP, patients had to have progressed 
on at least one other systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC (including chemotherapy and a prior ALK-
TKI) or resistance mutations not covered by approved ALK TKIs, or leptomeningeal disease. 
  Hochmair et al. performed a retrospective real-world data analysis in 51 patients registered in an 
early  access  program  in  Austria,  who  received  second-  or  later-line  lorlatinib  between  January 
2016  and  May  2020.  The  ALK-positive  cohort  consisted  of  37  patients  with  a  mean  age  at 
metastatic diagnosis of 53.0 years (range, 29–77), including 19 patients (51.4%) presenting with 
brain  metastasis  at  diagnosis.  Patients  received  multiple  lines  of  therapy  before  switching  to 
lorlatinib  (median  number  of  prior  treatments  was  4;  range,  2–9).  The  ORR  in  patients  who 
received only one prior second generation ALK-TKI before lorlatinib treatment (N=10) was 40% 
(95%CI 12, 74). The median duration of treatment (DoT) was 4.4 months (95%CI: 0.5; 8.2). 
  Orlov et al. reported a single-center experience (I.P. Pavlov Medical University, St.- Petersburg, 
Russia) оf the use of lorlatinib within the compassionate use program that was accessible in Russia 
within  2017–2019.  The  study  included  35  subjects  with  ALK-rearranged  NSCLC.  The  mean  age 
was  46.7  years  (range:  24–80  years).  The  median  follow-up  time  was  17.5  months.  The  ORR 
observed in 14 patients treated with prior ceritinib only was 29% (95%CI: 8, 58) and the median 
PFS was 15 months (95%CI: 6.2; 21.8). 
Moreover,  an  international  real-world  analysis  published  by  Zhu  et  al.  included  76  patients  with  ALK 
positive  NSCLC  enrolled  in  the  compassionate  use  program  in  Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  South  Korea, 
Taiwan,  Thailand,  and  in  the  US  Expanded  Access  Program  (NCT03178071).  The  median  age  was  53 
years (13-73). In 84% of the patients, brain metastases were present at the start of lorlatinib therapy 
and 14% had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Of these 76 patients, 9 had received a second-generation 
Assessment report

ALK TKI as the only ALK-TKI received which included ceritinib (n=8) and brigatinib (n=1). The ORR for 
the 8 evaluable patients was 13% (95%CI: 0, 53). 
In summary, the lorlatinib early access program made available to patients with advanced ALK positive 
NSCLC after failure of at least one ALK-TKI has resulted in 3 publications of 10 + 14 + 8 (n=32) patients, 
respectively, who were treated in the second-line post a second-generation TKI and the ORRs were 40%, 
29%, and 13%, respectively.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Several ALK-targeted TKIs are approved for the treatment of advanced ALK+ NSCLC in patients, who 
are either treatment-naïve or have received one or two prior ALK-TKIs. Lorlatinib is already approved 
for the treatment in the second and third-line setting for advanced NSCLC. 
This application has been submitted to extend the lorlatinib indication to the treatment of ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC in patients who are not previously treated with an ALK-TKI, i.e. prior chemotherapy is 
allowed. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To  support  this  application,  the  MAH  submitted  the  results  from  a  phase  III,  randomized,  open-label 
study  (Study  1006),  comparing  lorlatinib  to  a  standard-of  care  TKI,  crizotinib.  Crizotinib  was  still  the 
standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC at the time of study initiation so the control 
arm is considered adequate. However, alectinib monotherapy is now the preferred first-line treatment 
option.  
Lorlatinib and crizotinib are both oral treatments given continuously in 28-days cycles and no crossover 
was allowed from the control arm.  
The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review (BIRC) and 
secondary endpoints were OS, PFS by investigator (INV), objective response rate (ORR), duration of 
response (DOR), intracranial ORR plus DOR and patient-reported outcomes (PRO). The objectives and 
endpoints for the pivotal study are endorsed. PFS by BIRC as primary endpoint is especially supported 
since the pivotal study was unblinded. 
Overall, eligibility criteria clearly define the target population.  
The sample size calculations and stratification factors for randomization (brain metastases and 
ethnic origin) are considered appropriate. 
The study was open-label and measurements were in place to minimize the impact of knowing the 
assigned treatment on the main outcomes. Patients were allowed to continue with the randomized 
treatment despite radiological disease progression, if they experienced clinical benefit. This is not 
optimal since the investigators were not blinded to treatment and may have called PD late and 
continued treatment with lorlatinib in absence of clinical progression. Reversely, the investigators 
might have called PD early in the crizotinib-treated patients, as this was expected to have inferior 
efficacy, especially in the brain. However, since cross-over was not allowed and the primary endpoint 
was assessed by the BICR, which was blinded to the assigned treatment, this is acceptable. 
Nonetheless, lorlatinib is not recommended to be used beyond radiological PD and it is reflected in the 
SmPC that treatment duration should be until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Overall, the statistical methods implemented to calculate PFS and OS are endorsed. Several 
sensitivity analyses were planned to assess the robustness of the model. It was noted that censoring 
Assessment report  
Page 84/120 
 
 
  
 
patients who discontinue treatment after 126 days or start a new anti-cancer therapy corresponds to a 
HR where treatment discontinuation and treatment switch do not occur, which is not considered 
plausible in clinical practice. A supplementary analysis was performed to test the effect of the 
censoring rules on the results. For this analysis, all PDs and deaths were considered events regardless 
of missing assessments or timing of the event. OS was calculated in a similar manner to PFS. Patients, 
who did not die during follow-up, were censored. Sensitivity analyses were also presented to assess 
the effect of the covariates on the results. In addition, the statistical methods used to calculate and 
compare ORR are endorsed. 
The approach implemented by the MAH to control the type I error due to multiple IA is acceptable. It is 
noted that the 1st IA for PFS was performed with 127 events. The MAH updated the efficacy 
boundaries according to the observed numbers of events. This is acceptable. 
OS and PFS were controlled for multiplicity using a hierarchical approach, which is agreed. The other 
secondary endpoints are considered exploratory. 
The changes to the PFS analyses were planned and implemented in the protocol before the MAH had 
access to the PFS results. Therefore, the changes made in the SAP are not expected to compromise 
the interpretation of the results of the study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population comprised a total of 296 randomized patients (149 in the lorlatinib arm vs 147 
in the crizotinib arm). The primary efficacy analyses were based on this population.  
Patient  recruitment  seems  overall  unbiased.  It  is  noted  that  the  vast  majority  of  patients,  who 
discontinued lorlatinib did so due to PD, or adverse events and only 4 patients withdrew from the study. 
In the crizotinib arm, 5 patients withdrew even before treatment start. Moreover, after treatment start 
a further 8 patients withdrew from the study, while 3 patients discontinued due to ‘global deterioration’ 
called by the investigator. This may have caused bias and led to an under-performance of the control 
arm. 
The COVID-19-related changes to study conduct described are to be expected, acceptable and are 
not expected to have had any major impact on the study results. 
The important protocol deviations in the pivotal study were equally distributed between the treatment 
arms (~42%). 
The treatment arms were generally well balanced with regards to the baseline characteristics of age, 
race,  ethnicity  and  smoking  status.  There  were  slightly  more  males  and  less females  in  the  lorlatinib 
arm, which may have favoured the control arm, but this is acceptable as gender was not a stratification 
factor.  
Disease  baseline  characteristics  indicated  a  similar  number  of  patients  with  brain  involvement  at 
baseline  (28.2%  vs  29.3%)  per  independent  central  radiological  review.  Fewer  patients  with  pleural 
metastases (43.0% vs 53.1%) were allocated to lorlatinib, which may have favoured this arm due to the 
clinical impact and the potential complications from the drainage of pleural fluids. However, this small 
imbalance is unlikely to have affected study results and is acceptable.   
It is noted that significantly more patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 2 were included in the 
crizotinib  arm,  while  slightly  less  patients  with  PS  0  were  included  in  the  crizotinib  arm,  both  factors 
which may favour outcome of the active arm with lorlatinib. However, the performance of the control 
arm regarding the primary endpoint PFS by BIRC (9.3 months (95%CI: 7.6, 11.1) is in line with other 
Assessment report  
Page 85/120 
 
 
  
 
studies with crizotinib in a similar first-line setting, which is reassuring. The use of prior local or systemic 
anti-cancer therapies was comparable between groups.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS by BIRC was met and statistically significantly improved at the 
first IA performed after 72% events as of the data cut-off date of 20 March 2020. The median PFS follow-
up duration was 18.3 months (95%CI: 16.4., 20.1) in the lorlatinib arm and 14.8 months (95%CI: 12.8, 
18.4) in the crizotinib arm. The HR was 0.28 (95%CI: 0.191, 0.413) in favour of lorlatinib because the 
median PFS by BIRC was not estimable (95%CI: NE, NE) with lorlatinib versus 9.3 months (95%CI: 7.6, 
11.1) in the crizotinib arm. The KM curves clearly separate after 4 months of therapy corresponding to 
the markedly fewer PFS events with lorlatinib (27.5% vs 58.5% events). There was a high number of 
censoring and it is noted that 16.3% in the crizotinib arm vs 6.7% in the lorlatinib were censored due to 
start of new anti-cancer therapy. 
The sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC counting all PD and deaths as events shows a HR of 0.30, which 
is consistent with the primary analyses (HR 0.28). The sensitivity analyses stratified by brain metastases, 
ethnic origin, and ECOG performance status were also consistent (HR 0.30) with the primary analysis. 
The multivariate cox regression analysis showed that treatment group and ECOG PS status significantly 
affected the outcome, which is consistent with the statistically and clinically significantly better PFS in 
the lorlatinib arm and with previous findings showing that ECOG PS status is a strong prognostic factor 
in most clinical trials in oncology. 
PFS by INV is overall in line with the PFS by BIRC results regarding PFS by INV events in the lorlatinib 
arm (26.8% vs 27.5% events). However, markedly more patients had a PFS by INV event in the crizotinib 
arm  (70.7%  vs  58.5%),  which  is  probably  due  to  the  open-label  trial  design.  The  control  arm  with 
crizotinib fairs quite similarly regarding both PFS by BIRC versus by INV (9.3 months vs 9.1 months). 
Based  on  Investigator  assessment,  both  an  earlier  timing  and  more  frequent  number  of  events  were 
reported,  while  the  BICR  assessment  offers  a  more  conservative  analysis  of  data.  However,  lack  of 
concordance in event registration questions the quality and strength of evidence and can be expected to 
have an impact on the initiation of subsequent lines of therapy. 
OS  data  is  immature  with  only  17%  events  and  a  similar  number  of  patients  are  censored  in  both 
treatment  arms.  Considering  the  prognosis  of  the  treated  disease  (median  OS  with  crizotinib  is  ~57 
months)  and  the  first-line  setting,  this  is  acceptable  for  now.  Acknowledging  the  limitations  of  an 
immature  analysis  (<20%  of  total  events),  no  gain  in  OS  was  demonstrated  for  lorlatinib  relative  to 
crizotinib. Similar findings were observed in previously performed trials comparing next-generation ALK-
Is  against  crizotinib.  It  is  likely  that  subsequent  therapies  might  have  had  an  impact  on  this  clinical 
outcome, particularly in view of the demonstrated benefit deriving from the sequential use of different 
ALK-Is upon disease progression. The MAH will provide updated OS data as part of the final clinical study 
report  for  the  pivotal  Study  B7461006  (CROWN)  by  30  June  2025.  These  mature  OS  results  are 
requested as an Annex II condition in order to rule out any detrimental effect on OS.   
As mentioned, post-study treatments are likely to have impacted on the overall survival. More than 
half of the population of patients initially assigned to crizotinib (58.5%) were initiated to a 1st post-study 
treatment, generally with a next-generation ALK-TKIs and alectinib and brigatinib were the most widely 
used. Lorlatinib was prescribed as 2nd post-study treatment in the control group (6 out of 26 patients 
undergoing a 2nd sequential ALK-TKI-based treatment). This reflects current clinical practice. Within the 
lorlatinib group, only 17.4% of patients underwent a 1st subsequent therapy, generally with a second-
generation ALK-TKI and it would be of interest to assess PFS2 under these alternative options, in order 
to ascertain response to therapy following lorlatinib as 1st TKI and the potential influence of development 
of resistance mutations. In the absence of a mature OS analysis, PFS2 data are desirable to assess the 
clinical  relevance  of  treatment  in  the  intended  front-line  indication  and  within  the  current  therapy 
landscape  characterised  by  the  availability  of  different  ALK-Is  that  are  generally  used  subsequently. 
Assessment report  
Page 86/120 
 
 
  
 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC therefore reports the absence of PFS2 at the present data cut-off, and the MAH 
has agreed to provide PFS2 data in the context of the next annual renewal (Recommendation).   
ORR by BIRC was clinically significantly improved with lorlatinib to 75.8% (95%CI: 68.2, 82.5) versus 
57.8% (95%CI: 49.4, 65.9) with crizotinib. It is noted that complete responses (CR) was only observed 
with lorlatinib (2.7%) and the improved ORR was mainly driven by the larger rate of partial responses 
(PR) in the lorlatinib arm (73.2% vs 57.8%). Duration of response by BIRC also clinically significantly 
prolonged with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (NE versus 11.0 months (95%CI: 9.0; 12.9) and it is noted that 
30%  of  the  patients  in  the  lorlatinib  arm  had  a  duration  response  of  ≥18  months.  Time  to  tumour 
response was less than 2 months and in line with TTR results from other available ALK TKIs.  
Efficacy in the brain was clearly improved with lorlatinib, which is best demonstrated by the time to 
intracranial progression by BIRC in the ITT population (HR 0.07 (95%CI: 0.026; 0.170). The intracranial 
ORR  in  patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline  is  also  improved  with  lorlatinib,  and  although  the 
numbers here are limited (N=78), there is a clear IC-ORR difference between the treatment arms i.e. 
65.8%  (95%CI:  48.6;  80.4)  vs  20.0  %  with  crizotinib.  The  intracranial  DOR  was  also  improved 
significantly with lorlatinib (NE vs 9.4 months, n=33). The number of patients with brain metastases at 
baseline were similar in both treatment arms and the median timing from prior radiotherapy to study 
entry were comparable between groups, thus providing a controlled analysis of lorlatinib effect on CNS 
disease.  Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that  lorlatinib  prevents  intracranial  progression  of  disease  and 
produced more and longer clinically relevant intracranial responses in patients with brain metastases at 
baseline compared to crizotinib. 
Overall, no clinically relevant differences are considered observed between the treatment arms regarding 
patient-reported outcomes. Since the study was open label, the PRO results should be interpreted 
with caution and are not displayed in the SmPC. 
ALK status was determined by the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx IHC test performed on the Ventana ULTRA 
or  XT  platforms.  The  low  level  of  detection  of  ALK  mutations  within  tumour  samples  in  the  study 
population (around 10% of total participants) is expected given the lack of exposure of patients to prior 
ALK targeted therapies. Considering that only 1 patient in the crizotinib group was found positive to ≥ 1 
ALK mutation, any data analysis and result interpretation by ALK mutation status is hampered. 
The CAN peripheral blood analysis showed very poor concordance with tumour sample analysis for ALK 
gene  arrangement  detection  (around  50%  regardless  of  treatment  arm).  Based  on  the  available 
information, it remains unclear the diagnostic value of the CAN blood peripheral analysis. The test was 
carried out using an assay set up for tumour mutation profiling; moreover, the correspondence between 
solid  tissue  and  peripheral  blood  cells  in  the  expression of  ALK  gene  mutations  is  dubious.  Given  the 
limited  applicability  of  the  CAN  blood  peripheral  analysis  in  clinical  practice,  these  uncertainties  are 
considered of limited impact on patient management and the issue is not further pursued. 
In  any  case,  the  low  accuracy  of  the  test  makes  the  biomarker  study,  which relies  entirely  upon  the 
plasma  based  ALK  mutation  detection,  of  limited  interpretability  and  clinical  utility.  Hence  the  MAH’s 
conclusions on higher efficacy for lorlatinib than crizotinib regardless of ALK mutation status and variants 
can only be given a speculative sense. Information about the importance of detection of ALK positive 
NSCLC for selection of patients for treatment with lorlatinib was included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The treatment effect of lorlatinib according to PFS by BIRC is consistent across important subgroups 
regardless  of  presence  of  brain  metastases  at  baseline,  gender,  age  and  smoking  status.  The  vast 
majority of the patients included had ECOG PS 0 (n=124) or 1 (n=160), in total ~96%, while only 12 
patients had ECOG PS 2. Even though the pivotal study was not stratified for ECOG PS status, it was 
considered clinically relevant to confirm efficacy in both groups, so the MAH was asked to provide an 
Assessment report  
Page 87/120 
 
 
  
 
analysis  of  PFS  by  BIRC  regarding  ECOG  PS  0  vs  1,  which  confirmed  clinically  relevant  PFS  by  BIRC 
results for patients with ECOG PS 0 (HR 0.21) and PS 1 (HR 0.35), respectively.  
Efficacy  data  was  also  provided  according  to  specific  age  categories  (i.e.  <65;  65-74,  ≥75  years), 
which overall confirm clinically relevant HRs for PFS in patients of more than 65 years of age (n= 47, HR 
0.41) and in the small subgroup of patients of 65-74 years of age (n=12, HR 0.23). This is acceptable. 
No further data was provided renal/hepatic impairment. 
The results from the supportive study cohort (n=30) showed a PFS of 16.6 months, an ORR of 90%, 
a median DOR of 17.2 months and an IC-ORR of 75%. These results are from a small cohort of patients 
with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC in the first-line setting and they are not directly comparable to the pivotal 
randomized phase 3 Study 1006. However, the efficacy of lorlatinib in the first-line setting is considered 
to be supported by these results. 
As part the current application, the MAH proposed to downgrade the second specific obligation (SOB) to 
a  recommendation  and  convert  the  conditional  MA  to  a  full  MA.  A  prospective  single  arm  study 
(B7461027)  to  test  lorlatinib  in  this  clinical  setting  was  agreed  as  a  SOB  at  the  time  of  the  initial 
conditional MA of lorlatinib, as a result of a relatively limited sample size of patients in the pivotal Study 
B7461001  who  previously  underwent  second-generation  ALK  TKI  treatment  as  1st  targeted  therapy 
(alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib). The MAH claims that the new efficacy and safety data derived from Study 
1006 together with the biomarker study conducted as part of study 1006 provides further evidence of 
efficacy of lorlatinib in the presence of ALK mutation variants, which can develop subsequently to TKI 
therapy. However, the newly submitted data only refer to untreated individuals who harbour ALK-positive 
NSCLC, thus providing an efficacy analysis of lorlatinib against crizotinib in a preceding line of therapy. 
Moreover, the biomarker study carries concerns on methodological aspects other than being limited in 
terms of number and variants of ALK mutations detected, given the untreated nature of subjects. These 
limitations hamper the clinical interpretability of results and any translatability of efficacy data to the 
2nd or subsequent lines of treatment, where prior exposure to a specific ALK-I is known to give rise to 
specific  resistance  mutations  that  can  compromise  the  subsequent  response  to  therapy.  Real-world 
evidence from the LORLATU (an expanded access program) with 197 ALK-positive patients treated with 
lorlatinib in 2L+ (median follow-up of 17 months) is considered supportive of efficacy of lorlatinib in this 
setting, as the ORR was 50.6%, the median PFS was 9.7 months (95%CI: 5.6-12), and median OS was 
32.9  months  (95%CI:  18.7-  not  reached),  but  only  8  patients  had  been  pre-exposed  to  second-
generation ALK TKIs, and thus of limited value.  
During the current procedure, real world efficacy data from new additional 32 patients progressing on or 
after one second-generation ALK-TKI with or without prior chemotherapy were submitted. The lorlatinib 
early access program made available to patients with advanced ALK positive NSCLC after failure of at 
least one ALK-TKI has resulted in 3 publications of 10 + 14 + 8 (n=32) patients, who were treated in 
the second-line post a second-generation ALK-TKI and the ORRs were 40%, 29%, and 13%, respectively. 
Taking into account that clinical trial data from the same setting in the Exp-3B cohort of the pivotal study 
for the CMA (n=28) showed an ORR of 42.9%, these RWE results somewhat deviate. Hence, it is not 
agreed that RWE from 32 patients with an ORR ranging from 13-40% is consistent with already assessed 
clinical trial data.  
Therefore,  the  conduct  of  the  planned  study  B7461027  is  still  merited  and  should  be  conducted  as 
planned  with  recruitment  of  approximately  70  patients  in  the  second-line  setting  post  a  second-
generation ALK-TKI (SOB). The MAH has clarified that this study is being conducted in 6 countries with 
a total of 25 investigational sites which are all active. The first patient was enrolled in September 2020. 
As of 11 June 2021, 18 patients have been enrolled in the study, reaching 25% of the total sample size. 
Enrolment is anticipated to complete in October 2022 with a readout (clinical study report) by June 2024, 
which is considered acceptable.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with lorlatinib has shown a statistically and clinically meaningful improvement of efficacy 
compared to crizotinib in the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC not 
previously treated with an ALK inhibitor. Although OS data are immature, the primary efficacy endpoint 
is supported by an improvement in overall response and duration of response both systemically and 
intracranially. 
Therefore, submission of the results of Study 1006 fulfilled the respective specific obligation. Since OS 
data are immature, the MAH will submit final OS data of the Phase III CROWN study (B7461006) as an 
Annex II condition (PAES).  
The clinical efficacy in patients previously treated with ALK inhibitors still requires confirmation and the 
clinical study report of study B7461027 will be submitted by 30 June 2024 (SOB). 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
•  Annex II condition 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of lorlatinib in 
patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor, the MAH will 
submit the results including overall survival (OS) data of the Phase III CROWN study (B7461006) 
comparing lorlatinib versus crizotinib in that same setting. The clinical study report will be submitted 
by 30 June 2025.  
•  Recommendation 
In the absence of a mature OS analysis, and with the aim to clarify the benefit deriving from treatment 
of patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor, the MAH 
has agreed to provide PFS2 data for the CROWN (B7461006) study in the context of the next annual 
renewal.  
•  Specific obligation (from initial MAA) 
In order to confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib in patients who progressed after alectinib or ceritinib as the 
first ALK TKI therapy, the MAH should conduct a single-arm study investigating patients in that same

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  safety  data  to  support  the  use  of  lorlatinib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously 
untreated and previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC are from pivotal Study B7461006 and 
the supporting Study B7461001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1006 and 1001, respectively). 
Study 1006 (n=291): Safety data from this study, at the time of interim analysis, are provided from 
the Safety Analysis Set of 149 participants treated with lorlatinib 100 mg QD and 142 participants treated 
with crizotinib 250 mg BID. The data cut-off date was 20 March 2020. 
Study 1001 (n=295): Study 1001 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 study in participants with ALK-positive or 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC and including participants who were either treatment-naïve or previously 
treated  with  one  or  more  ALK  TKIs  or  ROS1  TKIs  with  or  without  chemotherapy.  Initial  results  from 
Study 1001 were previously reported in the initial MAA submission that led to the approval of lorlatinib. 
Multiple doses of lorlatinib were evaluated in Study 1001; summaries of deaths, SAEs, and Grade 5 AEs 
were updated only for the 295 participants from Study 1001 treated with lorlatinib 100 mg QD. There 
were  20  additional  months  of  follow-up  compared  to  the  data  originally  presented  with  cut-off  date 
15 September 2017. The new data cut-off date was 14 May 2019.  
Patient exposure 
Table 64. Exposure to study treatment – Duration of treatment – Overall pooled, safety 
analysis set (Protocols B7461001, B7461006) 
For  Study  1006,  the  proportion  of  participants  who  remained  on  study  treatment  for  ≥12  months 
duration was 75.8% (113 of 149) in the lorlatinib arm, and 34.5% (49 of 142) in the crizotinib arm, with 
69.1% and 21.8% of participants, respectively, still on treatment at the time of data cut-off (data not 
shown).

Other significant adverse events – Study 1006  
Hypertension 
Hypertension  is  a  new  safety  finding  for  lorlatinib  and  considered  an  ADR.  Hypertension  was  more 
frequent in the lorlatinib arm compared to the crizotinib arm:   
• 
Lorlatinib arm: 18.1% (2.0% treatment-related) 
•  Crizotinib arm: 2.1% (0.7% treatment-related) 
Grade 3 AEs only occurred in the lorlatinib arm (15 [10.1%]); one of the grade 3 events was treatment-
related. There were no Grade 4 AEs. 
Hypertension was manageable and there were no events of hypertension leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation or dose reduction in the lorlatinib arm. Temporary treatment discontinuation occurred in 
4 (2.7%) participants in the lorlatinib arm (all Grade 3) and in 1 (0.7%) participant in the crizotinib arm.  
Overall,  23/27  (85.2%)  of  participants  were  administered  at  least  one  concomitant  anti-hypertensive 
medication, 19 participants without other intervention and 4 in combination with temporary treatment 
discontinuation. The median time to onset of anti-hypertensive medication was 62 days (range: 0-722). 
Of  the  participants  with  hypertension,  20/27  (74%)  had  an  outcome  of  resolved;  in  13/23 (56.5%) 
participants  who  were  treated  with  anti-hypertensive  medication,  the  event  resolved  with  medication 
alone.   
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia is a new safety finding for lorlatinib, and considered an ADR. Hyperglycaemia was more 
frequent in the lorlatinib arm compared to the crizotinib arm:  
• 
Lorlatinib arm: 10.1% all-causality and 5.4% treatment-related  
•  Crizotinib arm: 3.5 % all-causality and 1.4% treatment-related 
Grade 3 AEs of hyperglycaemia occurred in the lorlatinib arm only (5 [3.4%]); 1 event was treatment-
related.  There  were  no  Grade  4  AEs  and  no  events  of  hyperglycaemia  led  to  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation or dose modifications.

Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing  surveillance  has  been  conducted  since  lorlatinib’  s  initial  approval  in  2018.  The 
cumulative exposure to lorlatinib from marketing experience since product approval is estimated to be 
1070  patient-years.  The  overall  safety  data  originating  from  post-marketing  sources  have  been 
consistent with the known lorlatinib safety profile. No new safety findings have been identified from post-
marketing sources. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database to characterise the safety of  lorlatinib comes from both the currently assessed 
Phase 3 1006 study and updated safety data from the phase 1/2 Study 1001. Hence, a review of pooled 
safety data from all patients, who had received the recommended dose of 100 mg QD was performed 
(n=476).  
In  the  pivotal  study  supporting  the  applied  indication,  the  median  exposure  of  lorlatinib  was  16.7 
months versus 10.4 months with crizotinib. Moreover, 75.8% of the patients in the lorlatinib arm were 
exposed for ≥12 months duration and 69.1% of the patients were still on treatment at the time of data 
cut-off. The median relative dose intensity of lorlatinib was similar in both the 1006 and 1001 studies 
i.e. 100%, which is considered reassuring, as the longer exposure in the 1001 study did not seem to 
have had a significant impact on this. For the pooled population, the median exposure is 16.3 months, 
which allows an assessment of longer-term safety with lorlatinib. 
In the pivotal study 1006, all patients had adverse events (AEs) with lorlatinib and ~97% of the AEs 
were treatment related. Grade 3-4 AEs were observed more frequently in the lorlatinib arm (72.5% vs 
55.6%); as well as treatment-related grade 3-4 events (55.7% vs 36.6%). For the pooled population, 
the overall frequencies of AEs, grade 3 (52.1%) and grade 4 AEs (12.4%) is in line with the pivotal 1006 
study. The most common AEs of any grade in the pooled population were also overall consistent to the 
frequencies  observed  in  the  pivotal  study  and  the  adverse  events  were  mostly  manageable  and  an 
acceptable guidance for handling is provided in the SmPC.  
In the pivotal 1006 study, the TEAEs more commonly observed with lorlatinib compared to crizotinib are 
(≥10%  absolute  difference):  hypercholesterolemia  70.5%  vs  3.5%;  hypertriglyceridemia  63.8%  vs 
5.6%; oedema 55.0% vs 39.4%; weight increased 38.3% vs 12.7%; peripheral neuropathy 33.6% vs 
14.8%; cognitive effects 21.5% vs 5.6%; anaemia 19.5% vs 7.7%; hypertension 18.1% vs 2.1%; mood 
effects  16.1%  vs  4.9%  and  hyperlipidaemia  10.7%  vs  0.  Notably,  more  grade  3  AEs  (≥5%  absolute 
difference) were also observed with lorlatinib: hypercholesterolemia 15.4% vs 0; hypertriglyceridemia 
12.8%  vs  0;  weight  increased  16.8%  vs  2.1%  and  hypertension  10.1%  vs  0;  while  more  grade  4 
hypertriglyceridemia events were observed with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (7.4% vs 0).  
AEs that occurred more frequently in the crizotinib arm were: (≥10% absolute difference): Diarrhoea, 
fatigue,  vision  disorder,  ALT  increased,  nausea,  vomiting,  constipation;  AST  increased,  decreased 
appetite, dysgeusia, and bradycardia. Hence, some of the GI toxicity observed with many ALK-targeted 
TKIs  including  crizotinib  were  less  frequent  with  lorlatinib,  while  it  is noted  that  clinically  significantly 
more  dyslipidaemia,  oedema,  neuropathy,  cognitive  effects,  and  hypertension  were  observed  with 
lorlatinib, also regarding high-grade events. Grade 3/4 events were rare except for hypercholesterolemia 
(16.8%/1.5%) and hypertriglyceridemia (15.1%/4.2%) and these events were mostly handled medically 
(see table 1 in section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) frequencies were updated in section 4.8 of the SmPC as part of the 
current  procedure  using  data  from  the  pooled  population  (n=476).  The  most  frequently  reported 
adverse  reactions  were  hypercholesterolaemia  (81.1%),  hypertriglyceridaemia  (67.2%),  oedema 
Assessment report

(55.7%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), weight increased (30.9%), cognitive effects (27.7%), fatigue 
(27.3%),  arthralgia  (23.5%),  diarrhoea  (22.9%)  and  mood  effects  (21.0%).  Serious  adverse 
reactions were reported in 7.4% of patients receiving lorlatinib. The most frequent serious adverse drug 
reactions were cognitive effects and pneumonitis.  
There  were  two  new  safety  findings  with  lorlatinib:  Hypertension  was  one  and  it  is  noted  that 
treatment-related  cases  were  rare  (2%).  This  is  a  known  class  effect  of  other  ALK-inhibitors. 
Hyperglycemia was also a new safety finding and although this was also observed in the crizotinib arm, 
the event is more frequent overall (10.1%) and as a treatment-related event (5.4%) with lorlatinib. Five 
patients  experienced  a  grade  3  event.  However,  the  ADRs  of  hyperglycaemia  and  hypertension  were 
assessed in the context of another procedure (II/13). 
Adverse  events  of  special 
interest  with 
lorlatinib  consists  of  hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, oedema, weight gain and CNS-related effects. The main focus for this assessment 
was the CNS-related effects and peripheral neuropathy, while the remaining AESIs are well known with 
lorlatinib and the incidences are considered acceptable. CNS-related effects are common with lorlatinib 
and was the main dose-limiting toxicity in the phase 1 study. The CNS-related toxicity has been difficult 
to distinguish from effects of the underlying disease, especially from brain metastases in the second- 
and  third-line  setting  (~60%  of  the  patients  present  with  brain  metastases  at  start  of  second-line 
treatment). However, in the pivotal 1006 study conducted in the first-line setting where brain metastases 
are less frequent (~20-40%), the CNS-related toxicity is still often observed with lorlatinib treatment. 
Cognitive  effects  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  lorlatinib  arm  than  in  the  crizotinib  arm  (21.5%  vs 
5.6%) and grade 3 AEs occurred in the lorlatinib arm only (2.9%); there were no Grade 4 AEs. The most 
frequent cognitive effect of any grade in the overall pooled lorlatinib 100 mg QD safety analysis set was 
memory impairment (11.3%), and the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 reactions were confusional state and 
cognitive disorder (1.7% and 0.8%, respectively). Mood effects were also more frequent in the lorlatinib 
arm than in the crizotinib arm (16.1% vs 4.9%) and there were 2 Grade 3 AEs, both in the lorlatinib 
arm.  The  most  frequent  mood  effect  of  any  grade  in  the  overall  pooled  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD  safety 
analysis set was anxiety (6.5%), and the most frequent Grade 3 and 4 reactions were irritability and 
depression (0.8% and 0.4%, respectively). Speech effects AEs occurred only with lorlatinib (4.7%), but 
only one grade 3 event and no discontinuations. The most frequent speech effect of any grade in the 
overall  pooled  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD  safety  analysis  set  was  dysarthria  (4.0%),  and  the  Grade 3  or  4 
reactions were dysarthria, slow speech and speech disorder (0.2% each). AEs of psychotic effects also 
occurred in the lorlatinib arm only (3.4%), but no grade 3 or 4 events were observed. Overall, the CNS-
related  effects  from  lorlatinib  are  correctly  mentioned  in  section  4.4  (warnings)  and  4.8  (dose-
modifications and incidences) of the SmPC, and since most events are of low grade, this is considered 
adequate information for the prescriber. Peripheral neuropathy was frequent in any grade (43.7%) 
and considered treatment-related in 30.3% of the patients of the pooled population. However, grade 3 
AEs  occurred  at  a  low  frequency  (2.7%,  all  causality)  and  only  1  treatment-related  event  led  to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. Hence, peripheral neuropathy is frequent with lorlatinib, but since 
grade 3 events were rare, this is considered manageable. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in a similar number of patients in both arms of the 
pivotal 1006 study (34.2% vs 27.5%); however, only 8.1% vs 4.9% of the SAEs were assessed to be 
treatment-related.  SAEs  in  the  pooled  population  is  consistent  i.e.  39.5%  SAEs,  of  which  8.0%  were 
treatment-related. The most common SAEs observed in the pooled population was disease progression 
(6.3%),  pneumonia  (4.4%)  and  dyspnea  (2.9%),  which  is  acceptable  and  reflects  the  profile  of  the 
targeted disease.   
Deaths due to treatment toxicity were rare in the pivotal study 1006 (1.3%, 2 patients) and patients 
most  frequently  died  due  to  disease  progression,  both  in  the  pivotal  1006  study  (11.4%)  and  in  the 
Assessment report  
Page 109/120 
 
 
  
 
pooled  population  (30%).  The  two  treatment-related  deaths  from  lorlatinib  were  cardiac  failure  and 
respiratory failure and from the narratives provided, it is agreed that it cannot be ruled out that the two 
deaths were treatment-related, although the underlying disease also contributed to death in both cases. 
Considering the targeted disease and the non-curative setting, this is acceptable. 
Haematological  toxicity  with  lorlatinib  was  less  frequent  and  could  also  be  due  to  the  underlying 
treated disease. Grade 3-4 events were rare and manageable. Laboratory shifts are summarized in 
Table 81 and since high-grade events were rare, this is considered overall acceptable and manageable. 
There were no Hy’s law cases. 
Regarding the safety performance of lorlatinib in special populations, AEs according to age group does 
not  seem  affected  in  the  lorlatinib-treated  patients,  while  more  grade  AEs  were  observed  in  the  high 
age-group  treated  with  crizotinib.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  are  observed  regarding  AEs  by 
gender  subgroup  in  either  treatment  arm.  More  grade  4  AEs  were  observed  in  the  Asian  subgroup 
compared to non-Asians receiving lorlatinib (19.7% vs 9.6%) and crizotinib (12.5% vs 5.1%). The MAH 
has  clarified  that  of  the  increased  grade  4  AEs  reported  in  Asian  patients  who  received  lorlatinib, 
hypertriglyceridaemia was the most frequently reported. The remaining AEs reported did not exhibit a 
discernible pattern either based on the mechanism of action of lorlatinib or a specific system organ class. 
Although  there  are  some  reports  suggesting  that  Asians  may  have  higher 
incidence  of 
hypertriglyceridemia compared to non-Hispanic Whites (Ariel et al, 2014), the relative higher frequency 
of  hypertriglyceridemia  in  Asian  patients  in  Study  B7461006  was  not  observed  in  Study  B7461001 
(hypertriglyceridaemia  reported  in  3  (2.8%)  of  Asian  patients  and  3  (1.9%)  of  non-Asian  patients). 
Moreover, a review of the data from both the lorlatinib and crizotinib programs did not provide causal 
evidence  for  a  higher  risk  of  Grade  4  AEs  in  Asian  patients  compared  to  non-Asian  patients.  It  is  a 
possibility that the differential findings from Study B7461006 may have been due to factors unrelated 
to race; however, the MAH will continue to monitor the reports of Grade 4 AEs among Asians and non-
Asians as part of regular safety surveillance. This is acceptable. 
Discontinuations due to AEs in the pooled population were 9.2%, of which 4.2% of the events were 
considered  treatment-related.  It  is  noted  that  grade  3  events  of  cognitive  effects  and  peripheral 
neuropathy were the most frequent events to led to discontinuation, although rare with 3 and 2 patients 
in  each  group.  The  rate  of  discontinuations  is  acceptable  considered  the  non-curative  setting.  Dose-
interruptions  due  to  AEs  were  frequent  in  both  treatment  arms  in  the  pivotal  1006  study  (49%  vs 
47.2%) in the lorlatinib arm vs the crizotinib arm. This is in line with the frequency observed for the 
pooled  population  (34.7%),  where  the  most  common  AE  leading  to  dose-interruptions  were 
hypertriglyceridemia, oedema and cognitive effects. Dose-reductions were slightly less common and 
occurred  in  22.3%  of  the  pooled  population,  most  often  due  to  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and 
cognitive effects. Of note, the SmPC describes dose reductions due to adverse reactions, which occurred 
in  20.0% of  patients  receiving  lorlatinib,  and  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  associated  with 
adverse reactions, which occurred in 3.2% of patients receiving lorlatinib (data not shown in this report). 
Furthermore, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the safety data from the 
overall pooled, safety analysis set (protocols B7461001, B7461006) for hypercholesterolaemia, hyper-
triglyceridaemia, central nervous system effects and lipase and amylase increase (data not shown in this 
report).  The  median  time  to  onset  for  both  hypercholesterolaemia  and  hypertriglyceridaemia  was  15 
days (hypercholesterolaemia range: 1 to 784 days; hypertriglyceridaemia range: 1 to 796 days). The 
median  duration  of  hypercholesterolaemia  and  hypertriglyceridaemia  was  451  and  427  days, 
respectively. Median time of occurrence of severe increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides is 104 
days  (range:  29  to  518  days)  and  120  days  (range:  15  to  780  days),  respectively.  Median  time  of 
occurrence of increase in serum lipase and amylase is 141 days (range: 1 to 1091 days) and 138 days 
(range: 1 to 1112 days), respectively. Median time to onset for cognitive, mood, speech and psychotic 
Assessment report

effects  was  109,  43,  49  and  23 days,  respectively.  Median  duration  of  cognitive,  mood,  speech  and 
psychotic effects was 223, 143, 147 and 74 days, respectively. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of lorlatinib compared to crizotinib is well-described and the size of the safety database 
(n=476) and median exposure of lorlatinib is sufficient to assess longer-term safety. The two new safety 
findings  of  hyperglycaemia  and  hypertension  identified  in  the  study  1006  have  been  included  in  the 
SmPC  as  part  of  a  separate  variation  (EMEA/H/C/004646/II/0013).  The  rate  of  discontinuation  is 
considered  acceptable  (9.2%).  Overall,  the  adverse  events  of  lorlatinib  are  considered  overall 
manageable and acceptable considering the non-curative setting and the underlying disease. 
Hence, the safety data provided from both the pivotal Study 1006 and Study 1001 have addressed the 
outstanding uncertainties on safety as identified in the context of the conditional marketing authorisation 
of lorlatinib for patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  MAH  is  seeking  an  extension  of  indication  to  include  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  anaplastic 
lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-positive  advanced non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  previously  not  treated 
with an ALK-inhibitor. The proposed revised wording of indication is the following:  
Lorviqua  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  anaplastic  lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated with an ALK 
inhibitor.  
Lorlatinib is conditionally approved as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC whose disease has progressed after: 
• 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or crizotinib and at least 
one other ALK TKI.    
The aim of therapy is to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) in the palliative setting. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Alectinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib are second-generation ALK-TKIs that prolong PFS and have CNS anti-
tumor effects. These therapies are recommended for treating patients with previously untreated 
advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, with alectinib being the preferred treatment option in the first-line 
setting.  
Most patients with ALK-positive NSCLC derive clinical benefit from first-line treatment with second-
generation ALK TKIs. However, emergence of resistance mechanisms, including ALK mutations 
continues to be a treatment challenge. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for additional ALK 
TKIs with broader mutational coverage and CNS penetration.   
Lorlatinib is a third-generation, selective, ATP-competitive, brain-penetrant, small molecule inhibitor of 
the ALK tyrosine kinase that was designed to overcome or prevent major mechanisms of resistance 
that develop following previous ALK-inhibitor treatment. It was also designed to penetrate the blood-
brain-barrier. These features indicate that lorlatinib has potential as therapy for previously untreated 
ALK-positive NSCLC.    
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for this application is the multicentre, randomised phase 3 CROWN trial, comparing 
lorlatinib with crizotinib in the TKI-naïve setting.  296 patients were randomised 1:1 in 104 sites in 23 
countries during less than 2 years and efficacy data presented are with less than 18 months of follow-
up for PFS in the lorlatinib arm and from data cut-off 20 March 2020. 
The primary endpoint is PFS by BIRC and the key secondary endpoints are OS, PFS by investigator 
(INV), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and intracranial ORR plus DOR. 
Assessment report  
Page 114/120 
 
 
  
 
Crizotinib was still the standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC at the time of study 
initiation so the control arm is considered adequate. However, alectinib monotherapy is now the 
preferred first-line treatment option.  
Lorlatinib and crizotinib are both oral treatments given continuously in 28-days cycles and no 
crossover was allowed from the control arm. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS by BIRC was met and statistically significantly improved at the 
first IA performed after 72% events as of the data cut-off date of 20 March 2020. The median PFS follow-
up duration was 18.3 months (95%CI: 16.4., 20.1) in the lorlatinib arm and 14.8 months (95%CI: 12.8, 
18.4) in the crizotinib arm. The HR was 0.28 (95%CI: 0.191, 0.413) in favour of lorlatinib because the 
median PFS by BIRC was not estimable (95%CI: NE, NE) with lorlatinib versus 9.3 months (95%CI: 7.6, 
11.1) in the crizotinib arm. The KM curves clearly separate after 4 months of therapy.  
PFS by INV is overall in line with the PFS by BIRC results regarding PFS by INV events in the lorlatinib 
arm (26.8% vs 27.5% events).  
OS  data  is  immature  with  only  17%  events  and  a  similar  number  of  patients  are  censored  in  both 
treatment arms.  
ORR by BIRC was improved with lorlatinib to 75.8% (95%CI: 68.2, 82.5) versus 57.8% (95%CI: 49.4, 
65.9)  with  crizotinib.  Complete  responses  (CR)  were  only  observed  with  lorlatinib  (2.7%)  and  the 
improved ORR was mainly driven by the larger rate of partial responses (PR) in the lorlatinib arm (73.2% 
vs 57.8%).  
Duration of response by BIRC was prolonged with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (NE (95%CI: NE, NE) versus 
11.0 months (95%CI: 9.0; 12.9)) and 30% of the patients in the lorlatinib arm had a duration response 
of ≥18 months. Time to tumour response was less than 2 months and in line with TTR results from other 
available ALK TKIs. 
Efficacy in the brain was improved with lorlatinib regarding time to intracranial progression by BIRC 
in  the  ITT  population  (HR  0.07  (95%CI:  0.026;  0.170).  The  intracranial  ORR  in  patients  with  brain 
metastases at baseline is also improved with lorlatinib (N=78) i.e. 65.8% (95%CI: 48.6; 80.4) vs 20.0 
% (95%CI: 9.1; 35.6) with crizotinib. The intracranial DOR was improved with lorlatinib (NE (95%CI: 
NE, NE) vs 9.4 months (95%CI: 6.0, 11.1), n=33) and 72% of the patients (n = 18) in the lorlatinib 
arm had a duration response of ≥12 months. 
The treatment effect of lorlatinib according to PFS by BIRC is consistent across important subgroups 
regardless of the presence of brain metastases at baseline, gender, age and smoking status.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
OS  data  are  immature  but  considering  the  prognosis  of  the  treated  disease  in  the  first-line  setting 
(median OS with crizotinib is ~57 months), this is acceptable for now. The MAH will provide updated OS 
data as part of the final clinical study report for the pivotal Study B7461006 (CROWN) by 30 June 2025 
(Annex II condition).  
Since an updated OS analysis will not be available until 2025, PFS2 data will be presented in the context 
of the next annual renewal (Recommendation).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal study 1006, all patients had adverse events and ~97% of the AEs from lorlatinib were 
treatment-related.  
For the pooled population, the overall frequencies of AEs, grade 3 (52.1%) and grade 4 AEs (12.4%) is 
in line with the pivotal 1006 study. The most common AEs of any grade in the pooled were also overall 
consistent to the frequencies observed in the pivotal study.  
Adverse  events  of  special 
interest  with 
lorlatinib  consists  of  hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, oedema, weight gain and CNS-related effects. CNS-related effects are common 
with lorlatinib and was the main dose-limiting toxicity in the phase 1 study. Cognitive effects occurred 
more  frequently  in  the  lorlatinib  arm  than  in  the  crizotinib  arm  (21.5%  vs  5.6%)  and  grade  3  AEs 
occurred in the lorlatinib arm only (2.9%); there were no Grade 4 AEs. Mood effects were also more 
frequent in the lorlatinib arm than in the crizotinib arm (16.1% vs 4.9%) and there were 2 Grade 3 AEs, 
both in the lorlatinib arm. Speech effects AEs occurred only with lorlatinib (4.7%), but only one grade 3 
event and no discontinuations. AEs of psychotic effects also occurred in the lorlatinib arm only (3.4%), 
but no grade 3 or 4 events were observed.  
Peripheral neuropathy was frequent in any grade (43.7%) and considered treatment-related in 30.3% 
of the patients of the pooled population. However, grade 3 AEs occurred at a low frequency (2.7%) and 
only 1 treatment-related event led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
There were two new safety findings with lorlatinib, hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Hypertension 
was  one  and  it is  noted  that  treatment-related  cases  were  rare  (2%).  This  is  a  known  class  effect of 
other ALK-inhibitors. Hyperglycaemia was also a new safety finding and although this was also observed 
in  the  crizotinib  arm,  the  event  is  more  frequent  overall  (10.1%)  and  as  a  treatment-related  event 
(5.4%) with lorlatinib. Five patients experienced a grade 3 event.  
Serious  adverse events  (SAES)  were  observed  in  a  similar  number of  patients  in  both  arms  of  the 
pivotal 1006 study (34.2% vs 27.5%) and this corresponded to 39.5% in the pooled population. The 
most  common  SAEs  observed  in  the  pooled  population  was  disease  progression  (6.3%),  pneumonia 
(4.4%) and dyspnoea (2.9%).  
Deaths due to treatment toxicity were rare (1.3%, 2 patients in the pivotal study) and patients most 
frequently died due to disease progression, both in the pivotal 1006 study (11.4%) and in the pooled 
population (30%). The two treatment-related deaths from lorlatinib were cardiac failure and respiratory 
failure. 
Discontinuations due to AEs in the pooled population were 9.2%, of which 4.2% of the events were 
considered treatment-related. Grade 3 events of cognitive effects and peripheral neuropathy were the 
most frequent events to led to discontinuation.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  target  population  of  ALK  inhibitor-naïve  advanced  ALK-positive  NSCLC  have  other  effective 
treatment options with alectinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib, which prolong PFS and have CNS anti-tumour 
effects. Although most patients derive clinical benefit from these treatments, emergence of resistance 
mechanisms,  including  ALK-mutations,  continues  to  be  a  treatment  challenge.  Therefore,  there  is  an 
unmet medical need for additional ALK TKIs and lorlatinib is designed to meet this need. 
Lorlatinib has received conditional MA in the 2L setting for patients who progress on second-generation 
ALK-TKIs. Data in support of the CMA were derived from a single-arm, uncontrolled trial demonstrating 
therapeutic  activity  of  lorlatinib  in  patients  previously  treated  with  alectinib,  ceritinib  or  brigatinib  as 
either  1st or  subsequent line  of  treatment.  The  extent  of  the  benefit  with  lorlatinib  in  the  second-line 
indication after a second-generation ALK-TKI still requires confirmation to be provided in the context of 
the ongoing study B7461027 (SOB). However, the data from the current variation are considered to fulfil 
the requirement of the second specific obligation to the CMA (CROWN study).   
There was a clinically meaningful improvement of the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS by BIRC with a 
median  not  estimable  (95%CI:  NE,  NE)  for  lorlatinib  versus  9.3  months  (95%CI:  7.6,  11.1)  in  the 
crizotinib  arm,  HR  0.28  (95%CI:  0.191,  0.413).  The  KM  curves  clearly  separate  after  4  months  of 
therapy corresponding to the markedly fewer PFS events with lorlatinib. PFS by INV results were in line

and supportive. Although OS data is immature with only 17% events, considering the prognosis of the 
treated disease in the first-line setting (median OS with crizotinib is ~57 months), this is acceptable.  
The overall response rate with lorlatinib was also clinically significantly improved with lorlatinib. There 
was also a clinically significant longer duration of response by BIRC with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (NE 
versus  11.0  months)  and it  is  noted  that  30%  of  the  patients  in  the  lorlatinib  arm  had  a  duration  of 
response of ≥18 months.  
Efficacy in the brain was clearly improved with lorlatinib, which is best demonstrated by the prolonged 
time  to  intracranial  progression  by  BIRC  in  the  ITT  population  (HR  0.07)  and  the  intracranial  ORR  in 
patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline  i.e.  65.8%  vs  20.0  %  with  crizotinib.  Additionally,  the 
treatment  effect  of  lorlatinib  according  to  PFS  by  BIRC  is  consistent  across  important  subgroups 
regardless of presence of brain metastases at baseline, gender, age and smoking status. 
Since  OS  data  are  immature,  the  MAH  will  submit  final  OS  data  of  the  Phase  III  CROWN  study 
(B7461006) as an Annex II condition (PAES) and PFS2 data in the context of the next annual renewal 
(Recommendation).  
Moreover,  the  ongoing  study  B7461027  (SOB)  should  be  conducted  as  planned  with  recruitment  of 
approximately 70 patients in the second-line setting post a second-generation ALK-TKI. The clinical study 
report will be submitted by 30 June 2024. 
Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that  treatment  with  lorlatinib  has  shown  a  statistically  and  clinically 
meaningful improvement of efficacy in terms of PFS, response rate and duration of response compared 
to crizotinib in the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC not previously treated 
with  an  ALK  inhibitor.  In  addition,  lorlatinib  also  prevents  intracranial  progression  of  disease  and 
produced more and longer clinically relevant intracranial responses in patients with brain metastases at 
baseline compared to crizotinib. This improved efficacy is balanced against the safety profile of lorlatinib, 
even though there were 2 new safety findings in the pivotal study (hypertension and hyperglycaemia) 
and 
that 
lorlatinib  causes  more 
toxicity 
than  crizotinib 
regarding  hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy  and  CNS-related  effects.  Since  these  AEs  were 
mostly  of  low-grade  and  manageable,  the  markedly  improved  efficacy  outweighs  these  risks  with 
lorlatinib. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  benefit-risk  balance  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC  not 
previously  treated  with  an  ALK  inhibitor  is  positive.  Further  clarifications  are  still  needed  in  patients 
previously treated with a second-generation ALK-TKI (SOB).  
The safety profile of monotherapy with lorlatinib in the targeted population is considered acceptable. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lorviqua monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced 
NSCLC not previously treated with an ALK inhibitor is positive and submission of the results of Study 
1006 fulfilled the respective specific obligation. However, since OS data are immature, the MAH will 
submit final OS data of the Phase III CROWN study (B7461006) as an Annex II condition (PAES).  
Assessment report  
Page 118/120 
 
 
  
 
The B/R in patients previously treated with ALK inhibitors still requires confirmation and the clinical 
study report of study B7461027 will be submitted by 30 June 2024 (SOB). 
In addition, the MAH should update the RMP as requested by the next given opportunity.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Copalia 
Amlodipine/valsartan 
On 27 June 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Copalia. The marketing authorisation holder for these medicinal products is Novartis 
Europharm Ltd. They may request a re- examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new contraindication as follows: 
" Concomitant use of angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARB) - including valsartan - or of angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with aliskiren in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment 
(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2).” 
Detailed conditions for the use of these products will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full contraindications for Copalia will be as follows2: 
•  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Keytruda 
pembrolizumab 
On 21 May 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Keytruda, 
intended as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults. The applicant for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. 
Keytruda will be available as a 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The active 
substance of Keytruda is pembrolizumab, an antineoplastic monoclonal antibody (ATC code L01XC18) 
that potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to 
PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. 
The benefit of Keytruda has been reported in adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma who were either ipilimumab naive (OS HR=0.69, 95%CI: 0.52, 0.90; p-value<0.00358; PFS 
HR=0.58; 95%CI: 0.47, 0.72; p-value<0.00001 in comparison to ipilimumab) or previously treated with 
ipilimumab (PFS HR=0.57; 95%CI: 0.45, 0.73; p-value<0.0001 in comparison to chemotherapy). 
The most common side effects are diarrhoea, nausea, pruritus, rash, arthralgia and fatigue. Keytruda is 
associated with immune-related adverse reactions including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, 
endocrinopathies, uveitis, myositis, pancreatitis, and severe skin reactions. 
The full indication is: "Keytruda as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable 
or metastatic) melanoma in adults". It is proposed that Keytruda be prescribed by physicians experienced 
in the treatment of cancer.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

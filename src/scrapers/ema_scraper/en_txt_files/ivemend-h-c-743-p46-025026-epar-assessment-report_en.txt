1.  Introduction 
On May 21, 2017, the MAH submitted two completed paediatric studies for Ivemend (fosaprepitant), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that P029 (“A Phase IIb, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled 
Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability of Fosaprepitant 
in Pediatric Subjects for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) 
Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy”) and ONO-7847-03 (”Japanese Clinical Study in Pediatric 
Patients Multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study for the prevention of CINV”) are part of a clinical 
development program. The application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing 
several studies) is expected to be submitted by 3Q2017. A line listing of all the concerned studies is 
annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Fosaprepitant was supplied as a 150 mg vial to be reconstituted and then diluted prior to 
administration.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final reports for: 
• 
Study P029 entitled “A Phase IIb, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled 
Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Fosaprepitant in Paediatric Subjects for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and 
Vomiting (CINV) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy”;  
The study was a worldwide, multicentre, partially-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD), dose-ranging study, to evaluate the PK, PD, and safety and 
tolerability of aprepitant, after administration of a single dose of fosaprepitant concomitantly 
with IV ondansetron, with or without dexamethasone. Protocol 029 evaluated multiple IV 
fosaprepitant doses in paediatric subjects from birth to 17 years of age, and was amended to 
include an open-label evaluation of the PK and safety/tolerability of a 5 mg/kg fosaprepitant 
dose in children birth to <12 years of age. An additional evaluation of the PK of 
dexamethasone in infants birth to <1 year of age was also included in the amendment. 
• 
Study ONO-7847-03 entitled ”Japanese Clinical Study in Paediatric Patients Multicenter, open-
label, uncontrolled study for the prevention of CINV”;  
The study is a small (n=27) prospective, uncontrolled open-label study of fosaprepitant in 
children 6 months to 18 years of age in a Japanese population. In this study, 3 mg/kg (to a 
maximum of 150 mg) fosaprepitant IV was administered to patients 6 months to <12 years of

age and 150 mg IV to subjects 12 to 18 years of age in combination with a 5-HT3 antagonist 
on Day 1 and corticosteroids on Days 1 to 3. 
2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
In accordance with Article 46, the MAH submitted two study reports which are further reviewed below. 
Study P029 “A Phase IIb, Partially-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled 
Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Fosaprepitant in Paediatric Subjects for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea 
and Vomiting (CINV) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy” 
Methods 
Objectives 
The MAH states that the primary objectives of this study were to estimate aprepitant plasma 
concentration profiles and PK parameters and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fosaprepitant, 
administered concomitantly with a 5-HT3 antagonist, in paediatric patients from birth to 17 years old 
receiving emetogenic chemotherapy. The secondary objective was to estimate IV dexamethasone 
plasma concentration profiles and PK parameters in paediatric patients from birth to 1 year old 
receiving emetogenic chemotherapy, concomitant dexamethasone, and IV ondansetron, in the 
presence or absence of fosaprepitant. 
According to MAH cover letter was P029 designed to support the United States paediatric 
requirements.  
Study design 
Protocol 029 was a Phase 2b, worldwide, multicentre, partially-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, 
PK/PD, dose-ranging study, to evaluate the PK, PD, and safety and tolerability of aprepitant, after 
administration of a single dose of fosaprepitant concomitantly with IV ondansetron, with or without 
dexamethasone (physician’s choice). Subjects 12-17 years old in the partially-blinded portion of the 
trial were randomized to receive either 150 mg, 60 mg, or 20 mg of fosaprepitant or matching placebo 
during Cycle 1. Subjects <12 years old were randomised to 3 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of 
fosaprepitant or matching placebo. Subjects enrolled under the open-label amendment received one 
dose (5 mg/kg) of fosaprepitant during Cycle 1. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects were 
then invited to receive open-label fosaprepitant in cycles 2 to 6, which 153 subjects did.  
Subjects were randomized/allocated at 49 sites. Thirty-five were allocated in Europe (including 4 sites 
in Russia) and 7 sites in the United States. 
The PK sampling of subjects in the fosaprepitant treatment groups was randomly determined upon 
subject randomization. For subjects from whom PK samples were drawn, the investigator and Sponsor 
were unblinded to the subject's treatment with fosaprepitant; however, they remained blinded to the 
dose level of fosaprepitant administered. For subjects from whom no PK samples were drawn, the 
investigator and Sponsor remained blinded to the treatment regimen (i.e. fosaprepitant or placebo) to 
which the subject was randomized.  
Study design and power preclude evaluation of efficacy.

Study population /Sample size 
Included patients (n=240) were scheduled to receive chemotherapy high risk of emetogenicity. 
Subjects <2 years of age were not permitted to participate until PK and safety data from the older age 
cohorts (2 to 17 years of age) were analysed to confirm the planned dose adjustments. After the 
interim analysis the study had an open-label amendment to include a single 5 mg/kg treatment arm. 
Because the adolescent cohort was fully enrolled prior to the interim analysis, only subjects birth to 
<12 years old were included in the 5 mg/kg-arm.  
Treatments 
Dose selection 
The approved dose recommendation of Ivemend is a single iv dose of 150 mg over 20-30 min in 
adults, in conjunction with a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid. 
A popPK (population pharmacokinetic) model of aprepritant has previously been developed based on 
three completed studies, oral administration of aprepritant (capsule) to adolescent (P097), patients 
from 0.5-17 years receiving oral administration of aprepitant (suspension; P148) and paediatric 
patients, 0.5-17 years, receiving either oral aprepitant (suspension) or IV fosaprepitant (P134). The 
popPK analysis was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/527/X/49/G and the model was concluded to 
adequately describe the observed data across all age categories. 
The popPK data were used for dose selection in paediatric patients to approximately match the 
exposure in adults following the recommended single iv dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant. A 150-mg dose 
was chosen as the highest dose for adolescents but with two further lower dose levels of 60 and 20 mg 
to be administered. For patients 4 mon to <12 years a 3 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) dose was selected as 
the highest and with two additional lower dose levels of 1.2 mg /kg (up to 60 mg) and 0.4 mg/kg (up 
to 20 mg) to be given. An interim analysis indicated lower exposure in younger children than predicted 
resulting in that the highest dose in 4 months to <12 years old patients was revised to 5 mg/kg. 
The PK following either iv or oral administration of fosaprepitant and aprepritant, respectively, in 
subjects younger <4 month has not been studied. Thus, the proposed doses in <4 months old subjects 
was modified due to immature expression of CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism 
aprepritant. In subjects 1-4 months of age, the dose was to be reduced by 50% to 2.5 mg/kg and in 
subjects birth to 1mon of age reduced by 75% to 1.25 mg/kg. 
Table 1 summarizes dose levels evaluated.

Table 1 
Fosaprepitant doses, administered as iv infusion over 30 and 60 min in teenagers 
and children <12 years, respectively  
According to the study report, the infusion time for subjects 12 to 17 years old was 30 minutes in 
duration, while that for subjects <12 years old was 60 minutes. The use of a longer infusion time for 
the younger children was to mitigate the predicted higher maximum concentration (Cmax) to area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio in young children compared to adults. By extending 
the infusion duration to 60 minutes for these younger children, the predicted peak aprepitant 
concentrations would be reduced to levels similar to that of adults.  
Subjects >6 months old on Cycle 1 Day 1 were administered three 0.15 mg/kg doses of IV 
ondansetron, up to the maximum daily dose specified in the local product label for paediatric usage or 
local standard of care. For subjects <6 months old, IV ondansetron was administered per local 
standard of care. Dexamethasone IV was permitted at the discretion of the investigator for subjects in 
all treatment groups. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 50% of the usual prescribed dose for 
the 48 hours following administration of 150 mg, 3 mg/kg, or 5 mg/kg fosaprepitant dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
According to the MAH the “All Subjects as Treated (ASaT)” population was used for the analysis of 
safety data, and included all randomized/allocated subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication. 
Any vomiting or use of rescue therapy within a phase of treatment (acute or delayed) defined a subject 
as having an unfavourable response for that phase and for the overall analysis (regardless of missing 
data at other time points) for all efficacy subject populations. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including AEs, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements. 
Results 
Baseline data 
In total 240 patients were included but 6 patients was never administered the study medication (1 
each in 3 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg-group, and 3 in the control group) which leaves 234 
patients in the All Subject as Treated (ASaT)-group.

Range 
The low percentage of subjects birth to <2years old was, according to the MAH, due in part to the fact 
that this cohort was never opened for enrolment in the partially-blinded amendment. Enrolment for 
subjects 12 to 17 years old was completed during the partially-blinded amendment; therefore they 
were not included in the fosaprepitant 5 mg/kg treatment group. No subjects less than 4 months of 
age were enrolled in the study 
Because of the prophylactic benefit of intravenous dexamethasone in the prevention of CINV, subjects 
were also stratified by planned use of dexamethasone. Of those subjects who did receive prophylactic 
dexamethasone in Cycle 1, use was similar between the 5 treatment groups. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Systemic exposure of aprepritant, calculated by noncompartmental analysis, following single iv infusion 
of fosaprepitant concomitantly with iv ondansetron, with or without dexamethasone in paediatric 
patients are summarized in Table 3. Exposure in adults after a 20-min iv infusion of fosaprepitant 150 
mg (study protocol 165) has been added by the MAH for comparison. 
Comparable total systemic exposures of aprepitant are seen in teenagers and adults after an iv 
infusion of 150 mg fosparepitant. A slightly lower Cmax was seen in the teenagers compared to in the 
adults but the infusion time was 30 and 20 min, respectively. 
The 3 mg/kg up to 150 mg dose resulted in lower exposure of aprepitant in children <12 years, the 
younger the lower, than in adults. 
After the 5 mg/kg up to 150 mg, the children birth to <2 years showed comparable total exposure to 
adults after 150 mg. In the age group 2 to <6 years, about a 25% higher exposure was seen 
compared to in adults while the 3 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) dose resulted in about 65% lower exposure 
than in adults.

Efficacy results 
The study had not the power, nor the design, to allow a reliable evaluation of efficacy.  
Cycle 1 data was used for the evaluation of efficacy as an exploratory endpoint. No efficacy evaluation 
was performed for Cycles 2 through 6.  
Complete Response (CR), defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication, was 
evaluated for the acute (0 to 24 hours), delayed (25 to 120 hours) and overall (0 to 120 hours) phases 
following initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1.

Safety results 
The ASaT population was used for the analysis of safety data. All AEs were reported by the 
investigators from the time of subject randomization through 14 days following cessation of treatment. 
Events related to the efficacy endpoint of Complete Response (vomiting, dry heaves) were not defined 
as AEs during the initial period of 120 hours following chemotherapy unless they met the definition of a 
serious adverse event (SAE). Beyond this period, vomiting and dry heaves were considered AEs. 
Adverse events were reported by 133 (83.1%) of the 160 subjects in the safety analysis in Cycle 1 for 
the partially-blinded amendment. A higher number of subjects in the fosaprepitant treatment groups 
had 1 or more reported AEs, while a higher number of subjects in the control regimen reported SAEs. 
The assessment of differences between fosaprepitant versus control is in line with conclusions from the 
MAH, that estimated differences between fosaprepitant versus control were minimal. Because subjects 
were enrolled in a single-treatment arm in the open-label amendment, analysis of AEs for 
fosaprepitant vs. control was not applicable. 
When all patients were included in the safety analysis, adverse events were reported by 198 (84.6%) 
of the 234 subjects in Cycle 1. Although there was some variability between treatment regimens in the 
proportion of subjects with AEs, there were no patterns noted. No serious drug-related AEs, deaths, or 
discontinuations due to AEs were reported for any subjects during Cycle 1 of the partially-blinded 
amendment. In the open-label amendment, 1 subject receiving fosaprepitant 5 mg/kg in the 2 to <6 
years old category was reported to have a drug-related SAE and discontinued due to the AE.

Six subjects (3.9%) had drug-related AEs in Cycles 2 to 6. The incidence of drug-related AEs for Cycles 
2 to 6 was similar to the results for Cycle 1. The only AE that occurred in more than 1 subject was 
hiccups. One subject had a drug-related AE of seizure that was considered to be a SAE. 
Serious adverse events were reported in 73 subjects (31.2%) for Cycle 1. The most commonly 
reported SAEs occurred in the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC, with febrile neutropenia 
occurring most frequently. No dose-related pattern was noted for febrile neutropenia incidence. The 
SAE profile was typical of a patient population with cancer receiving chemotherapy. One subject in the 
fosaprepitant 5 mg/kg treatment group in Cycle 1 had a SAE of anaphylactic reaction that was 
determined by the investigator to be drug-related. 
No subject deaths were reported in Cycle 1. Two subject deaths were reported in Cycles 2 to 6. One 
subject in the fosaprepitant 3 mg/kg regimen died due to a SAE of neutropenia during the Cycle 4 
follow-up period. One subject in the fosaprepitant 3 mg/kg regimen died due to a SAE of metastases to 
lung after receiving 4 cycles of study medication.  
Study ONO-7847-03 ”Japanese Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients Multicenter, open-label, 
uncontrolled study for the prevention of CINV”; 
Methods 
Objectives 
The study objective was to confirm the safety, efficacy, and PK-data of ONO-7847 in the prevention of 
CINV. 
According to MAH cover letter, protocol ONO-7847-03 was conducted to support approval of 
fosaprepitant in Japan for the prevention of CINV in paediatric patients. 
Study design 
The ONO-7847-03 study was a multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm trial. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study included 27 paediatric Japanese patients 6 months to 18 years old (12- to 18-years old: 
n=12; 6- to 11-years old: n=5; 2- to 5-years old: n=5; 6-months to 1-year old: n=5) with malignant 
tumours scheduled to receive chemotherapy.

Treatments 
A single IV dose of fosaprepitant meglumine was administered at a dose of 150 mg to 12- to 18-year-
old subjects and 3 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 150 mg) to 6-month to 11-year-old subjects. 
Granisetron and dexamethasone were administered as standard therapy in all subjects.

*4: Preventive treatment with granisetron (40 μg/kg) was permitted on the day of treatment with any of cisplatin, 
cyclophosphamide, or carboplatin, or moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy was evaluated during the acute phase (0-24 hours), the delayed phase (24-120 hours) and 
overall (0-120 hours). Vomiting, nausea and use of rescue therapy was measured. 
Safety evaluation included AE and SAE overall and due to study medication, clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs and ECG. Further plasma concentrations of ONO-7847 and aprepitant were measured and 
pharmacokinetic parameters of aprepitant in plasma investigated. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
It should be noted that this study was not powered to measure efficacy, and was a single-arm, open- 
label study with no control group for comparison. 
Efficacy was evaluated as a primary endpoint. For the primary analysis of efficacy the following 
population was used; all subjects who met key enrolment criteria, received at least 1 dose of both 
granisetron and dexamethasone phosphate, received any of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, or 
carboplatin, received at least 1 dose of investigational product, and had at least 1 post-treatment 
efficacy observation. 
Safety results 
The incidence of AEs was 100.0%, and the incidence of drug-related AEs was 14.8%. The most 
common AE was lymphocyte count decreased (96.3%). No deaths were reported in this study. Serious 
adverse events occurred in 2 subjects (7.4%), but no drug-related SAEs were reported. No 
abnormalities in vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, or body weight resulted in any safety issues.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Protocol 029 and ONO-7847-03 were designed to support the United States paediatric requirements 
and the approval of fosaprepitant in Japan. Both studies were conducted with the intention to evaluate 
PK- and safety data whereas study design and power precluded statistical evaluation of efficacy.  
There was an amendment filed to increase fosaprepitant dose to 5 mg/kg for certain age groups in 
study 029. This entails change of study design and complicates comparison between Ivemend 
treatment arms and the control arm. The rationale for an optional enrolment for cycle 2 to 6 is not fully 
comprehensible, even though the design does not severely hamper the primary objectives. 
The dose selection was based on popPK analysis aiming for exposure in children to be comparable to 
the exposure in adults following the recommended single iv dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant. A 150-mg 
dose was chosen as the highest dose for adolescents but with two further lower dose levels of 60 and 
20 mg to be administered. For patients 4 months to <12 years a 3 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) dose was 
selected as the highest and two additional dose levels of 1.2 mg /kg (up to 60 mg) and 0.4 mg/kg (up 
to 20 mg) to be given. An interim analysis indicated lower exposure in younger children than predicted 
resulting in that the highest dose in 4 months to <12 years old patients was revised to 5 mg/kg. 
The approved indication of Ivemend for adults permits administration in a peripheral vein. However, in 
study P029 Ivemend was administered via central venous catheters for all subjects. This could 
contribute to that some side effects, like rash at the infusion site, do not occur. 
The other antiemetic regimens consisting of 5HT-3 antagonist and possible glucocorticoids, is 
considered adequate. Stratification by dexamethasone administration is endorsed.  
The MAH states that overall, the data for P029 supports the conclusion that the single-day IV 
fosaprepitant regimen was generally well tolerated in paediatric subjects receiving emetogenic 
chemotherapy. The overall pattern of clinical and laboratory AEs in the Ivemend-arm  was similar to 
that observed for the control regimen, as well as to that typically observed in paediatric  subjects 
receiving chemotherapy, and to that observed in the aprepitant clinical development  program.  
No notable differences in the safety or tolerability profiles were observed among age subgroups. Safety 
signals reported are consistent with the already known safety profile of Ivemend. However the pattern 
of specific AEs cannot be properly assessed due to few AEs in each SOC category.  
Results from study ONO-7847-03 was in line with those in Protocol 029. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46, the MAH hereby submits two studies (study 029 and ONO-7847-03) in 
which the PK, safety and tolerability of Ivemend was evaluated in children 4 months to <18 years of 
age. Neither study was designed to evaluate efficacy. 
The overall assessment of these two studies are that the safety profile of Ivemend for children below 
18 years of age, for the doses administered in the studies, is in line with previously known safety 
profiles for adults.

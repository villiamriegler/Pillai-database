SmPC new text 
to update the treatment duration based on final 
results from EU PASS (protocol no. 242-12-402), 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a “A 
Multicentre, EU-wide, Non-Interventional Post-
Authorisation Study to Assess the Safety and Usage 
of Delamanid in Routine Medical Practice in 
Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Patients”. 
This treatment registry was for monitoring and 
documenting Deltyba use in routine medical practice 
and aimed to assess compliance with the 
recommendations in the authorised product 
information when prescribed as part of an 
appropriate combination regimen (ACR) for the 
treatment of MDR-TB. 
II and PL 
Section 4.2 
Treatment duration 
The total duration of treatment with delamanid is 24 
weeks. Data on longer treatment duration is very limited. 
When treatment with delamanid is considered necessary 
beyond 24 weeks to obtain a curative treatment, a longer 
duration of therapy may be considered. 
Section 4.4 
Deletion of the sentence: 
There are no data on treatment with delamanid for mor 
than 24 consecutive weeks (see section 4.2). 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH has proposed an update of section 4.8 of the 
the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs table) 
following the development of an improved 
methodology to identify relevant ADRs likely 
attributable to delamanid. The section 4 of the 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 4.1 has also been submitted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

SmPC, based on a statistical and medical judgement of 
ADRs seen in the two clinical trials 204 (phase 2) and 213 
(phase 3) as well from all post-marketing sources. 
Some ADRs were removed due to insufficient supporting 
evidence to retain them, in addition there was an update of 
some of the ADR frequencies, grouping of terms and 
addition of hypothyroidism with a frequency “common”.

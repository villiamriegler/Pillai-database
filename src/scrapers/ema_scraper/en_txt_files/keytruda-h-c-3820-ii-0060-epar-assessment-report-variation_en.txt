Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the human programmed cell 
death  1  (PD-1)  expressed  on  the  surface  of  cancer  cells  and  tumour  infiltrating  lymphocytes.  It  acts  as 
immune check-point inhibitor by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that downregulates the effector function 
of T cells, with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity (Oncologist. 2017 Jan; 
22(1): 81–88). 
The pharmacological inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 is a consolidated approach in the treatment of different 
malignancies. In the setting of lung disease, pembrolizumab is currently authorised in the EU: 
- as monotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with 
a ≥ 50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 5/103 
 
  
  
 
-  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  in  adults  whose  tumours 
express PD-L1 with a ≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients 
with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving 
Keytruda.  
-  in  combination  with  pemetrexed  and  platinum  chemotherapy  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations 
In  addition,  Keytruda  is  approved  for  melanoma,  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma,  urothelial 
carcinoma and HNSCC.  
Squamous Non-small cell lung cancer 
In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and 
the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths) (Bray F et al. CA Cancer J Clin. 2018). 
NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancer cases. Of the patients with NSCLC, tumour histology 
is approximately 40% to 60% adenocarcinoma, 10% to 15% squamous, 5% neuroendocrine, and the rest, 
“not otherwise specified”. Squamous NSCLC is a malignant epithelial tumour that shows either keratinisation 
and/or  intercellular  bridges.  Over  the  last  decades,  in  Europe  squamous  NSCLC  decreased  while 
adenocarcinoma has increased in men, while in women both squamous NSCLC and adenocarcinoma are still 
increasing (Forman D et al, IARC press 2013). Squamous NSCLC is most strongly associated with smoking 
in a dose-dependent manner, with nearly 90% of cases attributed to cigarette smoking.  
Compared to non-squamous histologies, squamous disease presents at an older age and more advanced 
disease stage at diagnosis, and is also associated with a higher incidence of comorbidities such as COPD and 
heart disease. Squamous NSCLC is usually centrally located, typically arising in the proximal bronchi and as 
a consequence more likely to invade large blood vessels (Socinski et al, J Thor Oncol 2017). 
A  new  edition  of  the  AJCC  Cancer  Staging  Manual  (8th  Edition)  was  published  in  late  2016  and  will  be 
effective for all cancer cases recorded on or after 1st Jan 2018. With the AJCC staging, locally advanced 
disease is stage III, advanced disease is stage IV (NCCN NSCLC guidelines 6.2018).  
Cytology may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinoma. In those cases 
where specific subtyping is not possible by morphology alone, a limited panel of IHC is recommended to 
determine  the  subtype:  TTF1  positivity  is  associated  with  probable  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma,  p40 
positivity with probable diagnosis of squamous NSCLC (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018). 
Squamous NSCLC 1st line treatment 
Molecular testing (EGFR, ALK) is not recommended in patients with squamous NSCLC due to the very low 
incidence  of  mutation,  except  in  those  rare  circumstances  when  squamous  cell  cancer  is  identified  in  a 
never-,  long-time  ex-  or  light-smoker  (<15  pack/years)  (ESMO  Metastatic  NSCLC  Guidelines  2018).  In 
addition, in case of mixed histology (adenosquamous), the presence of any adenocarcinoma component in 
a biopsy specimen that is otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing (NCCN NSCLC guidelines 
6.2018).   
Pembrolizumab monotherapy is considered a standard first-line treatment option for NSCLC patients with 
≥50% PD-L1 Tumour Proportion Score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations who do not 
otherwise  have  contraindications  to  the  use  of  immunotherapy,  including  squamous  histology  (ESMO 
Metastatic  NSCLC  Guidelines  2018).  The  pivotal  KEYNOTE-024  study  leading  to  the  approval  of 
pembrolizumab  in  1st  line  tested  pembrolizumab  vs  platinum-based  doublet  chemotherapy  (including 
pemetrexed+carboplatin,  pemetrexed+cisplatin,  gemcitabine+cisplatin,  gemcitabine+carboplatin,  or 
paclitaxel+carboplatin;  non-squamous  patients  could  receive  pemetrexed  maintenance)  in  NSCLC  with 
PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. The study included 18% of squamous cell lung cancer patients (i.e. 29 vs 27 subjects in 
pembro vs chemo arm). In the squamous subgroup, PFS HR was 0.35 (95%CI 0.17-0.71) (Reck M et al, 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 6/103 
 
  
  
NEJM 2016). A variation to extend the first line indication of pembrolizumab in NSCLC with TPS  ≥1% is 
currently  under  EMA  review,  based  on  the  result  of  KEYNOTE-042  study  (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0057 
procedure).   
Most  individual  trials  and  meta-analyses  evaluating  chemotherapy  options  in  the  first-line  treatment  of 
advanced  NSCLC  did  not  report  any  differential  efficacy  in  patients  with  squamous  NCSLC.  Therefore, 
platinum-based  (cisplatin/carboplatin)  doublets  with  the  addition  of  a  third-generation  cytotoxic  agent 
(gemcitabine, vinorelbine, taxanes) are recommended in advanced squamous cell cancer patients without 
major  comorbidities  and  PS  0-2  (ESMO  Metastatic  NSCLC  Guidelines  2018).  Notably,  pemetrexed  is  not 
indicated in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. No particular platinum-based doublet regimen has been 
proved to confer a clinically significant advantage over the others, choice often being based on safety profile. 
The addition of a third chemotherapy agent is not recommended. No effective maintenance strategies are 
available  in  squamous  NSCLC  (Daaboul  N,  Curr  Oncol  2018).  Neither  a  large  individual  trial  nor  a 
meta-analysis  found  an  overall  survival  benefit  of  six  versus  fewer  cycles  of  first-line  platinum-based 
doublets, although a longer PFS coupled with higher toxicity was reported in patients receiving six cycles 
(Rossi A, Lancet Oncol 2014). Therefore, four up to six cycles are currently recommended (ESMO Metastatic 
NSCLC Guidelines 2018).  
Albumine-bound  paclitaxel  (nab-paclitaxel)  is  considered  a  chemotherapeutic  option  in  advanced  NSCLC 
patients, particularly in patients with greater risk of neurotoxicity, pre-existing hypersensitivity to paclitaxel 
or contraindications for standard paclitaxel premedication (i.e. dexamethasone, H1 and H2 blockers) (ESMO 
Metastatic  NSCLC  Guidelines  2018,  Ann  Oncol  2016;  NCCN  NSCLC  guidelines  6.2018).  The  randomized 
phase  III  study  CA031  compared  carboplatin  +  nab-paclitaxel  vs  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel,  with  primary 
efficacy endpoint ORR based on the blinded radiological review. The null hypothesis of this study was that 
the Abraxane/carboplatin regimen response rate was non-inferior to that of the paclitaxel/carboplatin. A 
non-inferior efficacy of Abraxane/carboplatin as for Taxol/carboplatin combination therapy for the treatment 
of NSCLC was showed. Abraxane/carboplatin combination had lower neurotoxicity but higher haematologic 
toxicity  compared  to  Taxol/carboplatin  (EPAR  Abraxane  II/67;  Socinsky  et  al,  JCO  2012).  Abraxane  in 
combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of NSCLC in adult patients who are not 
candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy (Abraxane SmPC).

squamous NSCLC 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 7/103 
 
  
  
 
In EGFR expressing squamous NSCLC who have not received prior chemotherapy, necitumumab is indicated 
in  combination  with  gemcitabine  and  cisplatin  chemotherapy  (EPAR  Portrazza).  The  addition  of 
necitumumab  to  cisplatin/gemcitabine  has  not  been  adopted  as  a  standard  in  Europe  for  advanced 
squamous NSCLC and its use should be carefully evaluated (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018). The 
addition of necitumumab to the regimen cisplatin/gemcitabine was felt by NCCN Panel not beneficial based 
on  toxicity,  cost  and  limited  improvement  in  efficacy  vs  chemotherapy  alone  (NCCN  NSCLC  guidelines 
6.2018). 
The following indication was adopted by the CHMP:  
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, is indicated for the 
first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults.” 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
every 3 weeks. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab  is  a  protein,  which  is  expected  to  be  metabolised  in  the  body  and  biodegrade  in  the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for  Human  Use”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  pembrolizumab  is  exempt  from  the  submission  of  an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the 
environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The  applicant  did  not  submit  studies  for  the  ERA.  According  to  the  guideline,  in  the  case  of  products 
containing  proteins  as  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient(s),  an  ERA  justifying  the  lack  of  ERA  studies  is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new PK and immunogenicity data for pembrolizumab have been provided as part of this application. A 
description of the clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab in subjects with previously untreated metastatic 
NSCLC  was  included  in  variation  EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0048  (Commission  Decision  issued  on  02  August 
2018) to support 200 mg Q3W as the recommended dose of pembrolizumab in this patient population. 
In addition, a description of the pharmacology of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was 
included as part of variation Keytruda/H/C/003820/II/43 (Commission Decision issued on 04 September 
2018). This analysis demonstrated that the PK and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab are not impacted by 
concomitant chemotherapy.

Objectives 
Primary objectives:  
- To evaluate PFS per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR in participants treated with the pembro combo 
compared with the control. 
- To evaluate OS in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control. 
Secondary objectives:  
- To evaluate ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR in participants treated with the pembro 
combo compared with the control. 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the pembro combo treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Dual primary endpoint:  
- PFS defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 
based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
- OS defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented 
death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last known contact. 
Secondary endpoints:  
- ORR defined as the proportion of participants who had a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). 
- DOR defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. 
- Toxicities as defined by CTCAE v4.0 
Exploratory Objectives 
1. Evaluate the pembro combo compared with the control with respect to:  
a. PFS per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by investigator review in the next line of therapy (PFS2)  
b. PFS per irRECIST, as assessed by site investigator  
c. ORR and DOR per irRECIST, as assessed by  site investigator 
d. PFS and ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central imaging vendor and OS by PD-L1 status 
(≥1% vs <1%) and by taxane (investigator’s choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel)

Imaging assessment 
Initial tumour imaging at screening had to be performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization. 
The site study team had to review screening images to confirm the subject has measurable disease per 
RECIST 1.1. The screening images had to be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective 
confirmation of eligibility. 
The imaging assessments were performed at approximately Week 6, Week 12, and Week 18 from the date 
of randomization. Subsequent tumour imaging was performed approximately every 9 weeks or more 
frequently if clinically indicated. After 45 weeks, imaging was performed every 12 weeks. 
Sample size 
With ~200 subjects, the study has ~ 84% power for detecting a 25% difference in ORR (50% vs 25%) or ~ 
97% power for detecting a 30% difference in ORR (50% vs. 20%) at initially assigned 0.005 (one-sided) 
significance level. The study has ~ 94% power for detecting a 25% difference in ORR (50% vs 25%) or ~ 
99% power for detecting a 30% difference in ORR (50% vs 20%) at 0.025 (one-sided) significance level. 
With 415 PFS events, the study has ~ 90% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at initially assigned 0.01 
(one-sided) significance level, ~ 92% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.015 (one-sided) significance level, 
~ 94% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.02 (one-sided) significance level, and ~ 95% power for detecting 
a HR of 0.7 at 0.025 (one-sided) significance level. 
With 361 deaths, the study has ~ 85% power for detecting a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 at 0.01 (one-sided) 
significance level, ~ 90% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.02 (one-sided) significance level, and ~ 92% 
power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.025 (one-sided) significance level. 
The planned sample size is approximately 560 subjects assuming: (1) the enrollment period is 15.5 months 
and the ramp-up period of enrollment is 7 months; (2) median PFS is 6 months in the control group and the 
true hazard ratio is 0.7; (3) median OS is 12 months in the control group and the true hazard ratio is 0.7; (4) 
the annual dropout rate is 3% for PFS and 1% for OS; (5) the number of events and alpha levels of interim 
analyses and final analysis are as specified in the protocol. 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / 
integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Patients were randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups 
Stratification factors were: 
- investigator's choice of chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel) 
- PD-L1 status (TPS ≥1% vs <1%) 
- geographic region of the enrolling site (East Asia vs non-East Asia) 
The choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel treatment was determined prior to randomization. 
Participants were required to provide tumour tissue for PD-L1 determination. However, enrollment was open 
to participants regardless of PD-L1 expression status.

Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  population.  The  non-parametric 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each treatment group. The treatment 
difference  in  PFS  and  OS  was  assessed  by  the  stratified  log-rank  test.  For  PFS  and  OS  a  stratified  Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the 
stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate was reported. 
The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and 
the stratified Cox model. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for comparison of PFS based on investigator’s assessment. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by a blinded independent central 
imaging vendor, sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules was applied.  
In case the proportional hazards assumption is not valid, supportive analyses using Restricted Mean Survival 
Time  (RMST)  method  was  planned  for  PFS  and  OS  to  account  for  the  possible  non-proportional  hazards 
effect. 
An exploratory analysis of PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression 
after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever first, was planned. 
Since subjects in the control arm are allowed to switch to the pembrolizumab treatment after progressive 
disease, adjustment for the effect of crossover on OS was planned based on recognized methods, e.g., a 
two-stage method or the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model, based on an examination 
of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the methods. 
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method was used for the comparison of the ORR between the two 
treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size with a single treatment covariate was reported. The 
stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. 
If sample size permits, it was planned to summarize DOR descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and 
quartiles. Only the subset of patients who show a complete response or partial response will be included in 
this analysis. 
There are three planned interim analyses (IA) in addition to the final analysis for this study. The trial will 
continue until the number of death is approximately equal to the targeted number for the final analysis, 
irrespective  of  the  outcome  from  the  interim  analyses.  The  analyses  planned,  endpoints  evaluated,  and 
drivers of timing are summarized in the table below:

The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as 
well as interim analyses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and 
when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to 
other hypothesis tests (see Figure below) shows the initial one-sided alpha allocation for each hypothesis in 
the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are 
represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses. 
The  boundary  properties  for  each  of  these  alpha-levels  for  the  interim  analyses  were  derived  using  a 
Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. If the OS null hypothesis is rejected at an interim or final 
analysis, each PFS interim and final analysis test may be compared to its updated bounds considering the 
alpha reallocation from the OS hypothesis.  
The OS hypothesis may be tested at alpha=0.01 (initially allocated alpha), alpha=0.02 (if the PFS but not 
the ORR null hypothesis is rejected), or alpha=0.025 (if both the ORR and PFS null hypotheses are rejected).  
Results 
KEYNOTE-407 study is ongoing. The analyses reported in the submitted CSR were conducted using 
participants’ data from the pre-specified Interim Analysis 2 (IA2), and includes the evaluations of all 
primary and secondary objectives, as well as the following exploratory objectives: 
1.  PFS and ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central imaging vendor by PD-L1 status (≥1% vs <1%) and 
OS by PD-L1 status (≥1% vs <1%). 
2.  Changes in health-related quality-of-life assessments from baseline in the overall study population and 
by PD-L1 expression level using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13.

3.  Utilities in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control using the 
EuroQoL(EQ)-5D. 
The planned duration of KEYNOTE-407 is approximately 4 years. Data cutoff date was 03-APR-2018, at 
which time the overall median duration of follow-up was 7.8 months (range 0.1, 19.1). 
Participant flow 
Of the 220 participants who were assessed for eligibility, but not randomized in the study, 2 were due to 
physician decision and 218 were screen failures, the most frequent reasons being unconfirmed diagnosis of 
stage IV squamous NSCLC (14.3%), participant unable to provide qualified tumour tissue for PD-L1 
assessment (13.4%) and lack of written informed consent (13.4%).

Primary reason for Amendment 3 (13 Nov 2017)  
Description of changes: Alpha allocation scheme was updated. Added an interim analysis, extended the 
study duration and increased the number of PFS and OS events. 
Rationale: The statistical design was updated to optimize the study for the identification of long term 
treatment effect in OS and PFS.   
Protocol deviations 
Subjects with important protocol deviations were 46 (16.5%) and 47 (16.7%) in pembro-combo and chemo 
arms, respectively.   
Deviations were reported across the following categories: 
• Discontinuation criteria (n=2 for pembro combo; n=0 for control) 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=4 for pembro combo; n=5 for control) 
• Informed consent form (n=3 for pembro combo; n=5 for control) 
• Prohibited Medications (n=2 for pembro combo; n=7 for control) 
• Safety reporting (n=16 for pembro combo; n=17 for control) 
• Study intervention (n=15 for pembro combo; n=10 for control) 
• Trial procedures (n=10 for pembro combo; n=6 for control) 
Of these important protocol deviations, the MAH deemed 2 to be clinically significant. One participant (in the 
control group) was inadvertently administered blinded pembrolizumab/placebo for KEYNOTE-355 (another 
study open at the site) rather than the assigned placebo for KEYNOTE-407 on Day 1 of Cycle 1. The infusion 
was stopped after 10 minutes (approximately one third the planned dose) when the error was identified. 
Another participant incorrectly received placebo instead of pembrolizumab at Cycle 6 only. Both patients are 
included in the ITT analysis.  
Unblinding 
As of the data cutoff date, there were 2 participants who were inadvertently unblinded of their treatment 
assignment. Both unblinding events happened at the site level only, and had no impact on data analyses per 
evaluation  by  the  Sponsor’s  Significant  Quality  Issues  process.  Therefore,  these  2  participants  were  not 
excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses in IA2.

Compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline until Week 18 were in a range from 79.0% through 
95.0% in both treatment groups. The compliance rate for EORTC QLQ-LC13 and EQ-5D-3L were consistent 
with  that  for  EORTC  QLQ-C30.  Completion  rates  decreased  at  each  time  point  as  more  participants 
discontinued the study treatment.

Post-study treatments 
At the time of data cutoff, 208 (74.3%) subjects discontinued study treatment in the control arm. Of them, 
75 eligible subjects with PD verified by BICR crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy within the study. 
An additional 14 subjects received a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) as 
subsequent therapy outside of the study. Therefore, a total of 42.8% (89/208) of subjects in the control 
group who discontinued study treatment crossed over to a checkpoint inhibitor. In the chemotherapy group, 
only 110 subjects (53%,  110/208) received any subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy and the majority of 
these  (89/110  subjects,  81%)  received  a  subsequent  checkpoint  inhibitor.  Among  98  subjects  in  the 
chemotherapy group who did not receive second-line therapy, 62 died within 3 months after their last dose 
of study treatment.

Table 27: Summary of efficacy endpoints by age (<65, 65-74, 75-84) for KN407 alone and with the pooled 
data of KN407, KN189 and KN21G. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study supporting the sought indication is the ongoing KEYNOTE-407, a phase III randomized 
double-blind  placebo-controlled  trial  with  active  treatment  of  carboplatin-paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel 
chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab in first line metastatic (stage IV M1a or M1b-AJCC 7th edition) 
squamous NSCLC. No Scientific Advice to CHMP was requested on this study.  
Overall, patients’ selection criteria are considered reflective of the target population in the indication.  
Pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  or  saline  placebo  were  administered  in  association  with  carboplatin  + 
paclitaxel  or  nab-paclitaxel  for  a  total  of  4  cycles,  followed  by  pembrolizumab/saline  placebo  until 
progression for maximum 2 years (i.e. 35 cycles) of treatment. Currently, the 200 mg Q3W dose is being 
evaluated  in  multiple  clinical  studies,  is  the  approved  monotherapy  dose  in  patients  with  previously 
untreated  NSCLC  based  on  KEYNOTE-024,  and  is  the  dose  used  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in 
patients with non-squamous NSCLC in KEYNOTE-189. 
Participants  who  had  PD  verified  by  BICR  could  be  unblinded  and  crossover  to  or  continue  to  receive 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Re-treatment with open-label pembrolizumab at progression was allowed in 
case the drug had been previously stopped for CR or after 35 administrations for reasons other than PD or 
intolerability. Carboplatin with either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel is one of the accepted standard treatment 
option for 1st line squamous cell lung cancer. Cisplatin, although indicated and used in squamous disease, 
was  not  included  in  this  study.  Therefore,  no  data  are  available  for  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
cisplatin-based  chemotherapy  in  squamous  histology,  contrary  to  non-squamous  NSCLC  (KEYNOTE-189 
study)  where  both  cisplatin  and  carboplatin  (with  pemetrexed)  have  been  investigated  and  approved  in 
association with Keytruda. On the other hand, nab-paclitaxel is approved in combination with carboplatin 
only.  
International  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  4  to  6  cycles  of  treatment  (Planchard  et  al,  2018).  The 
number of cycles of chemotherapy used in this study was four. Investigators choice of number of cycles (up 
to six) could have been appropriate. Indeed, even acknowledging that no OS benefit has been demonstrated 
for  six  versus  fewer  cycles  of  first-line  platinum-based  doublets,  a  longer  PFS  was  reported  in  patients 
receiving six cycles (Rossi A, Lancet Oncol 2014). 
OS  and  PFS  per  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR  as  dual  primary  efficacy  endpoints  for  this  study  are  considered 
appropriate. ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Among the 
exploratory endpoints included in this submission, the MAH presented OS, PFS, and ORR by PD-L1 status as 
well as Quality of Life evaluation.    
Assessment report

Sample size calculation was driven by number of required PFS and OS events. However, the overall 1-sided 
2.5% type 1 error was split between the two primary endpoints and the ORR. The pre-allocated alpha was 
0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 for ORR, PFS and OS, respectively. The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz was 
applied to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be 
tested  more  than  once,  and  when  a  particular  null  hypothesis  is  rejected,  the  alpha  allocated  to  that 
hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis tests. Therefore, the power of the study depends on the 
allocated alpha and several scenarios were proposed. The sample size calculations result congruent with the 
assumptions made. 
Stratification factors used at randomization (PD-L1 status <1% vs ≥1%, investigator’s choice of paclitaxel 
vs nab-paclitaxel, East-Asia vs non-East Asia) are considered appropriate.  
The statistical methods used for time to events and binary endpoints are considered adequate. The graphical 
method of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses and O’Brien-Fleming approach to 
allocate Type I error rate across interim analyses are appropriate as well. 
Two global protocol amendments (02 and 03) are reported up to the cut-off date. The content of Amendment 
03 is the same as Amendment 02; the latter was retracted due to clerical and typographical errors. From the 
statistical point of view, an additional IA for PFS and OS was added and the alpha allocation scheme was 
updated. In the original protocol version, the type I error was controlled at 0.025 (one sided) for the 
hypothesis testing of ORR, PFS and OS and the pre-allocated alpha was 0.005, 0.015 and 0.005 for ORR, PFS 
and OS, respectively. ORR was tested first and the alpha was subject to rollover to PFS (i.e., PFS will be 
tested at 0.020 if ORR is positive or at 0.015 otherwise). The alpha for PFS was subject to rollover to OS (i.e., 
the overall OS alpha was 0.005 if PFS was negative, or 0.020 or 0.025 if PFS was positive and ORR was 
negative or positive, respectively). However, the same Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming approximation 
spending function defined in the original protocol was used for the calculation of efficacy bounds for PFS (IA2 
and IA3) and for OS (IA2, IA3 and final) that are more conservative due the introduction of a new IA and a 
new allocation scheme. Amendment 03 was approved and released prior to IA1 results being available to the 
independent DMC which is reassuring on the timing of the protocol amendment. 
Important protocol deviations occurred in a similar rate in both arms (16.5% vs 16.7%), and are not 
expected to have significantly impacted the trial results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 559 patients were recruited worldwide across 168 sites in 17 countries. Subjects were allocated 
1:1 to pembro combo arm (n=278) or control (n=281). Eligibility was assessed in 779 patients, for a total 
of 220 participants not randomized in the study. Of them, 2 were due to physician decision and 218 were 
screen failures (among which 217 failed to meet eligibility requirements based on the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria). The most frequent reasons for exclusion were unconfirmed diagnosis of stage IV squamous NSCLC 
(31 subjects, 14.3%), participant unable to provide qualified tumour tissue for PD-L1 assessment (29 
subjects, 13.4%) and lack of written informed consent (29 subjects, 13.4%).  
All randomized patients received the allocated treatment, except one subject in the control arm who was not 
treated. At the cut-off date, more subjects in the pembrolizumab combination arm were still receiving 
treatment compared to the control (43.5% vs 25.7%). Most common reason for discontinuation was 
progressive disease in both arms, more frequent in the control arm (30.9% vs 50%). The rate of 
discontinuation due to adverse events was on the contrary higher in the group receiving combination 
therapy compared to chemotherapy alone, as expected (17.3% vs 8.9%), which is approximately 
comparable to the discontinuation rate due to AEs seen in the combination arm of study KN189 (19.3% vs 
10.4%) supporting the approval of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum 
chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients. There was an 
imbalance in the number of patients who discontinued any drug due to a drug-related adverse event 
Assessment report

Page 38/103 
 
  
  
(pembro combo: 50 / 278 (18.0%), control: 20 / 280 (7.1%)). Treatment discontinuation due to withdrawal 
by subjects + physician decision + lost to follow-up was more common in the control arm (3.6% vs 6%).  
A total of 75 (27%) patients in the control arm crossed over to pembrolizumab at progression, which 
appeared quite low taking into account the current authorized indication after chemotherapy. However, an 
additional 14 subjects received a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) as 
subsequent therapy outside of the study. Therefore, 42.8% of subjects in the control group who 
discontinued study treatment crossed over to a checkpoint inhibitor (i.e. 75 within the trial and 14 outside 
the trial). This is similar to crossover rates in other first line NSCLC trials (e.g. 54% in KEYNOTE-24, 50% in 
KEYNOTE-189, 42.1% in IMpower-131). Specific reasons for not receiving a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor 
were not collected. In the chemotherapy group, only 110 subjects (53% of the 208 subjects in this group 
who discontinued from study treatment) received any subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy and the majority 
of these (89/110 subjects, 81%) received a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor.  
In the pembrolizumab combination arm, the most common subsequent anti-neoplastic therapies were 
gemcitabine (8.6%) and docetaxel (6.5%). In the chemotherapy arm, the most common subsequent 
anti-neoplastic therapy excluding checkpoint inhibitors was gemcitabine (5.7%). 
Baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects appeared overall balanced between the two arms. Median age 
was 65 years, ECOG was 0 (29%) or 1 (71%). As expected for squamous histology, the majority of subjects 
were male (81.4%) and former or current smokers (92% overall). According to international guidelines, 
patients with squamous NSCLC who are never or former light smokers should be considered for molecular 
testing (Planchard et al, 2018). It is acknowledged that the 2015 Guideline (College of American Pathologists 
(CAP)/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/Association for Molecular Pathology 
Guideline (AMP)) that was in place at the time of trial start did not recommend molecular testing for 
squamous histology (regardless of smoking status). Also a small number of patients with adenosquamous 
carcinomas have been included in KN407 study (13 patients, 2.3%). These patients are also recommended 
to undergo molecular analysis. Although EGFR and ALK analyses were recommended in 2015 Guidelines in 
the presence of an adenocarcinoma component in the tumour specimen, no data on molecular testing was 
available for those 13 subjects.  
According to PD-L1 status, approximately 63% of patients in both arms were PD-L1 positive (i.e. TPS≥1%, 
which was a stratification factor) and 35% PD-L1 negative, only 2% were PD-L1 unknown. Patients 
remained well balanced in both arms also in each PD-L1 expression subgroup TPS<1% (35%), 1-49% 
(37%) and ≥50% (26%).  
Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel were used overall by 60% and 40% of the subjects in each arm, respectively. 
Overall, subjects with prior radiation were 13.1%, with no meaningful imbalances between the two arms: 
prior thoracic radiation was reported only in 7%.  
This application is based on the results of the IA2 with a data cut-off date 3 April 2018, at which time the 
overall median duration of follow-up time was 7.8 months (range 0.1, 19.1). A statistically significant 
improvement in both PFS and OS was shown for pembrolizumab combination vs chemotherapy alone at the 
IA2. With a total of 349 PFS events (62% of the overall population), a reduction in disease progression by 
44% (HR=0.56; 95%CI 0.45, 0.70; p<0.0001) was shown for pembrolizumab combination vs control arm, 
for a median PFS of 6.4 vs 4.8 months. OS HR was 0.64 (95%CI 0.49, 0.85; p=0.0008) in favour of 
pembrolizumab combination, with a gain of about 4.6 months in median survival over chemotherapy alone 
(15.9 vs 11.3 months). However, maturity level of OS (i.e. number of OS events at IA2/number of OS events 
planned at final analysis) is 57%, (corresponding to 37% of the overall population experiencing an OS event) 
at this analysis and due to the high rate of censoring curves are hardly interpretable after month 3. A 
subsequent database lock for the prespecified IA3 was not available or planned in the near future, as along 
with statistically significant results for ORR at the IA1, all alpha-controlled analyses as specified in the 
protocol were completed at IA2.  
Assessment report

Overall, a consistent treatment benefit could be observed across all endpoints at the time of the interim 
analysis. However more mature OS data are needed. The MAH will submit the final CSR for KEYNOTE-407 as 
an Annex II condition by September 2021 in order to confirm the survival advantage of pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in 1L squamous NSCLC with longer follow-up. 
To assess the impact of cross-over on OS, proper statistical methods have been applied (e.g. analysis 
censoring at time of cross-over, Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW), Rank Preserving 
Structural Failure Time models (RPSFT), and two-stage methods) taking into account the assumptions 
required by the methods. The results were consistent with the primary OS analysis.  
Results from PFS sensitivity analysis 1 and 2, as well as PFS based on investigator assessment, were 
consistent with the primary analysis.  
The advantage of pembro combo over chemotherapy alone is also observed in terms of response rate 
(confirmed ORR based on BICR per RECIST 1.1: 57.9% vs 38.4%), although there was a similar number of 
complete responses in the two arms (1.4% vs 2.1%). Median DOR was also longer for pembro combo (7.7 
vs 4.8 months).  
With regards to subgroup analyses, it appears that the advantage of pembro combo is maintained in most of 
the subgroups analysed. For all subgroups except the PD-L1 subgroups, OS, PFS and ORR results were 
presented based on unstratified analyses. Results of the stratified subgroup analyses were overall 
comparable with unstratified data.  
Clinically meaningful improvement in outcomes from treatment with the combination in previously 
untreated patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC was observed in patients from both East Asia and 
non-East-Asia regions. However, the treatment effect was more pronounced in the East Asia population and 
no satisfying explanation could be given by the MAH. No meaningful differences in OS could be detected for 
never smokers vs smokers and patients with or without liver metastasis compared to the control group. 
Nevertheless, only limited data are available. 
In the KEYNOTE-189 combination study in non-squamous NSCLC, a clear relation between efficacy and 
increasing PD-L1 tumour expression was noted in all endpoints. In KEYNOTE-407, a trend for a better PFS 
HR of pembro combo vs chemo the higher the PD-L1 score has been observed. Differently, this trend is not 
evident in OS or ORR. OS HR appeared similar across all three subgroups. By looking at the KM curves, in the 
PD-L1 negative population (TPS<1%), curves of the two treatment arms appeared overlapping up to about 
month 6 before dividing in favour of pembro combo. Updated analyses will be provided with the final CSR 
(see Annex II). 
The available efficacy results of pembro combo in the different subgroups (TPS<1%, 1-49%, ≥50%) have 
been included in the SmPC. Unfortunately we can observe a crossing of the OS KM-curves at 3 month in 
patients with TPS<1%. The baseline characteristics for subjects with TPS<1% and early death within the 
first 3 months from randomization in both treatment arms were submitted, however due to the small 
number of patients, no relevant conclusion could be drawn from this data. 
KEYNOTE-407 study started before the approval of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in first line metastatic 
NSCLC  (including  squamous  histology)  with  TPS≥50%.  At  the  time  of  approval  of  pembrolizumab  in 
combination  with  pemetrexed  and  platinum  chemotherapy  in  non-squamous  NSCLC,  a  wording  was 
introduced  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC    for    stating  that  in  patients  whose  tumours  have  high  PD-L1 
expression, the risk of adverse reactions with combination therapy relative to pembrolizumab monotherapy 
should be considered and the benefit/risk ratio of the combined therapy evaluated on an individual basis of 
the  combination  regimen,  along  with  a  warning  in  section  4.4  underlining  the  lack  of  direct  comparison 
between pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab alone. Both statements are 
considered  applicable  to  the  sought  indication  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in 
squamous disease. Furthermore, as pembrolizumab monotherapy could be regarded as SOC in first line for 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 40/103 
 
  
  
the  PD-L1  high  subpopulation,  the  MAH  was  requested to  present  a  comparison  of  efficacy  between the 
combination  therapy  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  the  squamous  histology  and  provide  a  B/R 
discussion for subjects with TPS ≥50% considering the higher toxicity of the combination therapy. Since no 
trials provide a direct comparison between chemotherapy + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in 
1L NSCLC with PD-L1 expression TPS ≥50%, it is unclear whether patients with high PD-L1 expression would 
benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. In the absence of a clinical trial that would 
allow  direct,  definitive  analysis  comparing  efficacy  for  pembrolizumab  combined  with  chemotherapy  to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, the observed differences in efficacy should be interpreted with caution. 
An advantage of the combination with pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy alone was shown regardless the 
drug used (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel). It was however noted that the number of both OS and PFS events 
was higher in paclitaxel-based treatment compared to nab-paclitaxel-based subgroup.  
A trend toward reduced PFS and OS performance of pembro combo vs chemotherapy according with 
increase in age was noted. The MAH was asked to provide a summary of efficacy endpoints by age (<65, 
65-74, 75-84) for KN407 and for KN407 with the pooled data of KN189 and KN21G. Efficacy data for NSCLC 
patients ≥75 years receiving combination therapy in KEYNOTE-407 (squamous) and KEYNOTE-189 
(non-squamous) are reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to better guide physicians in the choice of 
treatment in elderly population. Furthermore, a warning that efficacy and safety data from patients ≥75 
years are limited, and that pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with caution after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis, was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
based on the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy data in 1st line non-squamous NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189). 
Such wording is considered applicable also to the applied indication.  
The analysis of PRO/HRQoL was included among exploratory endpoints, with no pre-specified hypotheses. 
Health-related QoL appeared to be maintained for the pembro combo arm.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  results  of  the  Interim  Analysis  2  of  the  pivotal  study  KEYNOTE-407  showed  a  consistent  treatment 
benefit  in  all  efficacy  endpoints  for  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin/paclitaxel  or 
nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Introduction 
In addition to the individual analysis of study KEYNOTE-407, data on clinical safety were derived from the 
following datasets: 
-  KEYNOTE-407  Combo  +  KEYNOTE-021-A  Combo  Safety  Dataset  (N  =  303):  Pooled  data  from  278 
participants  with  previously  untreated  metastatic  squamous  NSCLC  who  received  pembrolizumab  in 
combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (or nab-paclitaxel) in KEYNOTE-407 (data from IA2), and 25 
participants  with  NSCLC  of  any  histology  type  in  Cohort  A  of  KEYNOTE-021  and  were  treated  with 
pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel. 
-  KEYNOTE-407 Chemo Dataset (N = 280): Data from participants with metastatic squamous NSCLC who

Adverse events  
Adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study and for a minimum of 30 days after the end of 
study treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected for up to 90 days after the end of treatment 
or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the participant initiated new cancer therapy, whichever was 
earlier. All AEs were graded in severity according to the guideline outlined in the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

Post marketing experience 
The  safety  profile of  pembrolizumab  was  summarized  in  the  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  covering the 
period 04-SEP-2017 through 03-MAR-2018. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data in support of this application were derived from the individual analysis of the pivotal Phase 
III study KN-407 (n=278 in pembro combo and 280 in control), in addition to a pooled dataset of patients 
with  squamous  NSCLC  who  received  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  (nab)/paclitaxel-carboplatin 
(including  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab 
in  combination  with  carboplatin/paclitaxel  (or 
nab-paclitaxel) from Study KN-407 (n=278) and in patients from Study KN-021-A (n=25, including 9 with 
NSCLC of squamous histology). Data were compared to prior databases comprising non-squamous NSCLC 
Assessment report

patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  as  add-on  therapy  to  platinum/pemetrexed-based  doublets 
(KN-189+KN-021-G/C  pooled;  n=488)  and  a  reference  database  (RSD;  n=3830)  including  all 
pembrolizumab monotherapy indications currently approved in the EU.  
The KN-407 showed a median exposure of 8 cycles in the experimental arm vs 6 cycles in the control group. 
Length of treatment with pembrolizumab was independent of the combination regimen (8 administrations in 
median  in  both  the  paclitaxel  and  nab-paclitaxel  subgroup).  Exposure  to  carboplatin/paclitaxel  (or 
nab-paclitaxel) was similar between treatment arms.  
Compared with the other safety datasets, KN-407+KN-021-A pooled combo showed a shorter exposure to 
pembrolizumab than KN-189 +KN-021-G/C pooled combo (8 vs 11 administrations in median; exposure to 
chemotherapy  is  not  directly  comparable  considering  the  different  therapeutic  schemes  used  in  the  two 
clinical settings). This is likely explained by the shorter follow-up of KN-407 at data cut-off (7.8 months) 
compared to the 10.5 month follow-up in KN-189 at the time of dossier submission.  
In study KN-407, the frequency of overall AEs was generally similar between treatment arms (98.2% vs 
97.2%  in  pembro  combo  vs  control,  respectively),  with  the  exception  of  drug-related  AEs  (95.3%  vs 
88.9%),  serious  drug-related  AEs  (25.2%  vs  18.2%)  and  discontinuation  of  any  drug  due  to  either  AEs 
(23.4% vs 11.8%) or drug-related AEs (18% vs 7.1%) that occurred more frequently on combined therapy 
than chemotherapy alone. Moreover, more patients died in the combo arm than chemo group (8.3% vs 
6.4%), including those for whom fatalities were subsequent to drug-related AEs (3.6% vs 2.1%). This is in 
line with what has been previously reported in the non-squamous histology (KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled 
group).  As  expected,  the  combined  regimen  compares  unfavourably  with  the  RSD  for  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy across all different AE categories.  
Most  common  AEs  (incidence  ≥30%)  were  those  characteristic  for  chemotherapy  (anaemia,  alopecia, 
neutropenia,  nausea,  and  thrombocytopenia  in  the  Pembro  combo  group).  Some  of  these  incidences 
typically attributable to chemotherapy were reported with higher incidences in the Pembro combo group 
than in the control group (such as thrombocytopenia 30.6% vs. 23.2%, neutropenia 37.8% vs. 32.9%, and 
alopecia 46% vs. 36.4%).  
Exposure-adjusted  analysis  by  observation  period  revealed  that  the  majority  of  AEs  in  KN-407  occurred 
during the first 3 months of therapy in both arms, with a progressive and similar decline in incidence rate up 
to 6-12-month follow-up  between groups; this is expected given that exposure to chemotherapy, either 
alone or in combination, was limited to the first 4 cycles of therapy. A higher frequency of AEs beyond 12 
months was observed in the pembrolizumab arm likely due to the maintenance therapy not administered in 
the control group.  
In terms of SOC categories, the two treatments displayed a similar AEs pattern with blood and lymphatic 
system disorders as the prevailing events, followed by gastrointestinal, skin disorders and neurotoxicity. 
However,  their  occurrence  was  higher  in  the  pembro  than  control  group,  the  majority  of  events  being 
registered during the first 6 months of treatment. This temporal pattern suggests that events were mainly 
associated with cytotoxic agents with an additive effect of pembrolizumab co-treatment.  On the contrary, 
endocrine disorders were commonly reported in the combo group with a peak between 3-6 months but were 
rare in the control arm at all time points. Infections and infestations as well as respiratory and mediastinal 
disorders were generally similar between pembro combo and control up to 6-12 months; beyond 12 months, 
their incidence was higher in the experimental group (7.1% vs 2.4% and 4.3% vs 2.4% for infections and 
respiratory disorders, respectively) indicating a likely association with pembrolizumab maintenance therapy. 
In  KN-407,  the  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  was  increased  in  the  combined  therapy  compared  to 
chemotherapy  only  (95.3%  vs  88.9%).  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  were  the  most  frequent 
events  (68.7%  vs  58.2%)  with  pembrolizumab  increasing  the  rate  of  Grade  1,  Grade  2  and  Grade  4 
toxicities. Among the most prominent differences, a higher incidence of drug-related AEs were reported in

the experimental arm within the SOCs endocrine disorders (11.9% vs. 1.8%), nervous system disorders 
(51.1% vs 41.1%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (54.3% vs 43.9%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(55.4  vs.  45.4%),  general  disorders  (44.6%  vs.  39.3%),  infections  and  infestations  (12.2%  vs.  6.8%), 
musculoskeletal disorders (27.0% vs 22.9%), renal and urinary disorders (4.7% vs. 1.4%), and respiratory 
disorders  (15.8    vs.  11.4%).  The  fact  that  subjects  with  drug-related  AEs  were  more  numerous  in  the 
pembro combo supports the concept that pembrolizumab has an additive effect on chemotherapy toxicity, 
as also previously observed in KN-189.  
As expected, the comparison of the pooled KN-407+KN-021-A combo database with the clinical datasets of 
pembrolizumab used as monotherapy or in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in non-squamous NSCLC 
revealed an increased frequency of alopecia, myelosuppression and neuropathy that is consistent with the 
known  toxicity  profile  of  the  carboplatin-paclitaxel  association  and  that,  as  previously  mentioned,  is 
worsened  by  pembrolizumab  co-treatment.  Moreover,  serious  infusion-related  reactions  occurred  with  a 
common frequency in the pooled KN-407+KN-021-A group compared with no event reported in the pooled 
KN-187+KN-021-A database. A safety analysis in the AsAT as stratified by either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel 
use,  revealed  that  IRR  only  occurred  in  patients  who  received  paclitaxel,  either  with  (2.4%)  or  without 
(1.8%) pembrolizumab co-administration, and that the majority of these events were causally related to the 
taxane. The remaining drug-related events as distinguished by the different PTs were overall in line with the 
prior experience of pembrolizumab including thyroid dysfunction, renal and liver function abnormalities. 
While overall Grade 3-5 AEs occurred with a similar frequency between treatment arms, febrile neutropenia, 
hyponatraemia, diarrhoea, pneumonitis, colitis, autoimmune hepatitis and infusion-related reactions were 
more frequent in the combined therapy than control. Causality with treatment was reported in the majority 
of these events. All of these events were reported with increased frequency in the KN-407+KN-021-A pooled 
combo  compared  to  the  RSD  but  at  a  similar  rate  than  KN-189+KN-021-G/C  pooled  combo,  with  the 
exception  of  colitis,  autoimmune  hepatitis  and  infusion-related  reactions  that  occurred  more  often  than 
previously observed in the combined therapy (0.6%, 0.2% and 0%, respectively). Colitis was reported for 4 
(2.4%)  subjects  in  the  pembro/paclitaxel  combination  group  and  2  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the 
pembro/nab-paclitaxel  combination  group;  five  subjects  (1.8%)  experienced  autoimmune  hepatitis  in 
KN-407,  all  in  the  pembro/nab-paclitaxel  combination  group.  Of  note,  the  incidence  of  these  events  in 
KN-407 was similar to the RSD. The SmPC currently list them among the AEOSI and correctly reports the 
need for patient monitoring with suggested dose modifications should they occur.  
Febrile neutropenia, pneumonitis and colitis were also among the most frequent SAEs reported with a higher 
incidence in the pembro combo than control; also, infusion-related reactions were observed with a common 
frequency in the combined but not the control therapy (1.4% vs 0.4%). 
In KN-407, more fatalities due to AEs were reported in the pembro combo than control group (8.3% vs 
6.4%). With respect to the comparator, pembro combo increased the incidence of fatal respiratory failure 
(1.1% vs 0%), cardiac arrest (0.7% vs 0.4%) and sepsis (1.1% vs 0.4%). The pooled KN-407+KN-021-A 
dataset  comparison  with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  was  unfavourable  (7.6%  vs  4.1%),  although  a 
similar rate of deaths was reported in the pembrolizumab combination with platinum-pemetrexed (6.1%) 
which is consistent with the expected increased rate of toxicities in combined regimens.  
In  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab,  AEOSIs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
experimental arm than control. Their incidence in the KN-407 pooled combo was overall comparable with the 
RSD,  except  for  colitis  (3%  vs  1.9%),  hepatitis  (1.7%  vs  0.6%),  hyperthyroidism  (6.6%  vs 
3.5%)hypophysitis (1% vs 0.5%) and pneumonitis (6.3% vs 3.7%). To better evaluate the clinical relevance 
of these differences, incidence rates in a pooled data set comprising all pembro combination studies (KN189, 
KN407, KN021) compared to an updated RSD were requested and confirmed these trends although with an 
attenuation  of  differences  between  the  combined  therapy  in  the  NSCLC  setting  and  monotherapy  in  the 
overall  pembrolizumab  indications  as  regards  colitis  (2.9%  vs  1.9%),  hepatitis  (1.3%  vs  0.9%),

hyperthyroidism  (5.2%  vs  4.2%),  hypophysitis  (0.8%  vs  0.6%)  and  pneumonitis  (5.2%  vs  4.2%).  The 
SmPC has been amended accordingly with the new updated RSD rates for all AEOSIs. 
The  MAH  provided  analyses  of  pneumonitis  in  NSCLC  indicating  a  small,  but  numerically  higher  rate  of 
pneumonitis  compared  with  the  currently  reported  ones  for  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  across  all 
approved indications. The updated rates of pneumonitis in NSCLC have been reflected in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
As regards the other AEOSIs as listed above, their frequency is overall within the same range as previously 
observed  in  KN-189,  showing  that  cytotoxic  agents  increase  the  toxicity  associated  to  pembrolizumab 
therapy.  Indeed,  a  worse  safety  profile  of  the  combined  regimen  compared  to  monotherapy  can  be 
recognised and this needs to be considered by physicians in treatment-decision making (see section 4.2 of 
the SmPC). No differences in deaths due to AEOSIs were reported across datasets. 
In  terms  of  laboratory  abnormalities,  differences  between  pembro  combo  and  control  were  observed  in 
leukocyte  and  platelet  count  decrease,  and  liver  function  tests  with  a  more  unfavourable  profile  in  the 
experimental arm (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Safety analysis by age category revealed a higher rate of drug discontinuation due to AEs in the pembro 
combo  than  control  across  all  groups.  Of  note,  cardiovascular  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
youngest patients, which is quite unexpected. However, the group of patients ≥75-year-old was constituted 
of 33 and 30 patients in the experimental and control arm, respectively. Moreover, only three patients were 
aged ≥85 years. Therefore, data in the very elderly population remain very limited, as already stated in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. When analysing the population by the cut-off value of 65 years, a clear tendency 
towards worse tolerability to the combined therapy in ≥ 65 year-old than younger patients (≤ 65-year old) 
can  be  recognised.  Age-dependency  of  safety  emerges  across  all  datasets,  including  combo  and 
monotherapy  studies.  The  same  trend  can  be  observed,  as  expected,  within  the  chemotherapy  group 
although  the  association  of  pembrolizumab  to  the  cytotoxic  agents  clearly  enhances  the  rate  of  AEs 
compared to both chemotherapy only and pembrolizumab monotherapy. Therefore, careful consideration 
should be given to the treatment decision making for elderly patients (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
To overcome the limitations of the small numbers and to better characterize the safety profile in the elderly 
patients, the MAH was asked to provide analysis by age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years and using additional age 
categories (65 to 74 years old, 75 to 84 years old, and ≥85 years old)) in the pooled data set for pembro 
/chemotherapy combination therapy in 1L NSCLC. It emerged that 17% of deaths were due to an AE, 34.2% 
of discontinuations were AE-related, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were reported with a 
frequency of 31.6% and 9.2%, respectively, in patients ≥75-year-old. These rates are of concern, since they 
are notably higher compared to the same age group of the chemotherapy arms.  
Further analyses of pooled dataset showed that the proportion of patients with AEs in each AE category was 
mostly higher for the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy arms compared with the chemo arms and among 
subjects ≥65 years compared with <65 years. However the differences between both age categories were 
generally similar in both treatment groups apart from SAEs and discontinuations that were more pronounced 
in the elderly patients of the pembrolizumab combination arm. The analysis of AE categories of particular 
interest in the elderly population did not reveal categories with a notably larger difference in the elderly 
compared  to  the  <65  years  age  category.  No  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  ≥65  years  (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
Overall  similar  incidences  for  the  age  category  of  75-84  years  are  seen  between  both  treatment  arms; 
however rates of serious drug-related SAEs, discontinuations due to an AE and death due to an AE were 
higher in the pembrolizumab combination arm compared to chemotherapy arm. Nevertheless pooled NSCLC 
combination therapy data in the age group beyond 75 years are still considered too small to draw reliable 
conclusions or to provide more detailed information in the SmPC.

Unexpectedly  and  unlike  the  control  therapy,  the  combined  regimen  seemed  to  be  associated  with  an 
apparent lower tolerability in men than female, specifically with regard to dose modifications due to AEs, 
discontinuations due to AEs. The rate of drug modifications and discontinuations were also influenced by 
ECOG score, as expected. Overall, from the additional analyses submitted by the MAH, no significant clinical 
findings emerged in terms of sex-related tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination to chemotherapy.  
It was also investigated whether the use of nab-paclitaxel vs paclitaxel differed between region groups and, 
if it is the case, to what extent this could explain the region-dependent difference observed between EU and 
ex-EU. No major differences were observed in terms of baseline characteristics between treatment arms in 
both  EU  and  ex-EU.  The  choice  of  the  taxane  was  similar  between  regions.  A  few  disparities  could  be 
recognised in the incidence of certain AE categories between regions (i.e. discontinuation of pembrolizumab 
due to adverse drug reactions in the group of carbo/paclitaxel; discontinuation of any drug due to adverse 
drug reactions in the group of carbo/nab-paclitaxel). However it is agreed that specific subgroups of patients 
were numerically very limited to plausibly be indicative of region-dependent differences in tolerability of the 
combined therapy. 
Finally, common AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the combined therapy group included 
autoimmune hepatitis and pneumonitis (both with an incidence of 1.7%), colitis, respiratory failure and 
sepsis (1%) as well as cardiovascular events (including cardiac arrest 0.7%, cardiac failure 0.3%, 
cerebrovascular accident 0.3%). All of these events were deemed drug-related and occurred with a higher 
incidence than previously reported in KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled combo and RSD , with the exception of 
pneumonitis. Neutropenia (1.7%), infusion-related reactions and sepsis (1%) and cardiovascular events 
(cardiac arrest 0.7%, cardiac failure 0.3%, cerebrovascular accident 0.3%) were also among the main 
reasons for AE-related chemotherapy discontinuation in the experimental arm, their rate being higher than 
the other safety datasets. 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and 
DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with 
pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination 
with pembrolizumab to ameliorate potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with 
pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship 
was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Systemic 
corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants, can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat 
immune-related adverse reactions. Similarly, the potential of DDI between pembrolizumab and 
chemotherapy agents is expected to be low. No impact of co-administered chemotherapy on pembrolizumab 
PK was observed in KN-021-G. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Pembrolizumab  in  combination  to  (nab)/paclitaxel-carboplatin  therapy  for  squamous  NSCLC  compared 
unfavourable  with  chemotherapy  alone.  The  increased  toxicity  of  pembrolizumab  as  add-on  to 
chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in the intended population is consistent with the prior experience and 
already  authorised  indication  of  pembrolizumab  co-treatment  with  cytotoxic  agents  in  non-squamous 
NSCLC patients. Moreover, a  worse safety profile of the combined regimen emerged in comparison with 
pembrolizumab  monotherapy  that  should  be  considered  for  treatment  decision  making,  particularly  in 
elderly patients for whom data remain limited. The proposed SmPC reflects the available data and warnings. 
No changes to the RMP have been considered necessary as part of this procedure.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to introduce two minor editorial corrections to section 5.1 of the SmPC 
regarding the procedure EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0052, in relation to KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial carcinoma 
indication) which obtained a Commission Decision on the 6th of July 2018. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The only change in the leaflet is the addition of one paragraph regarding the combination products in section 
1 “What KEYTRUDA is and what it is used for”. There are no other proposed changes to the content of the 
package leaflet. In particular the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. 
Furthermore the design, layout and format of the package leaflet is not affected by the proposed revisions.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin and either 
paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults, based on 
the interim results of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-407. 
Squamous NSCLC is a malignant epithelial tumour comprising approximately 30-40% of the NSCLC that 
shows either keratinisation and/or intercellular bridges, which is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In advanced squamous NSCLC disease, molecular testing (EGFR, ALK) is not usually recommended due to 
the very low incidence of mutation, unless subject is a never or former light smokers (<15 pack/years). In 
case of mixed adenosquamous tumours, the adenocarcinoma component should trigger molecular analysis. 
Four to six cycles of platinum-based doublets chemotherapy with the addition of a third-generation cytotoxic 
agent (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, taxanes) are recommended in first line advanced squamous cell cancer 
patients without major comorbidities and PS 0-2 according to the ESMO guideline (Planchard et al, 2018). 
Albumine-bound  paclitaxel  (nab-paclitaxel)  is  an  option  particularly  in  patients  with  greater  risk  of 
neurotoxicity,  pre-existing  hypersensitivity  to  paclitaxel  or  contraindications  for  standard  paclitaxel 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 98/103 
 
  
  
 
premedication (i.e. dexamethasone, H1 and H2 blockers). Nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen response rate 
was shown to be non-inferior to that of the paclitaxel/carboplatin (Socinski et al, 2012).  
Pembrolizumab as monotherapy is currently indicated in first-line NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS≥50% expression, 
including squamous histology. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  upon  results  of  KEYNOTE-407  trial,  an  international,  randomized,  double-blind, 
phase  III  study,  placebo-controlled  with  active  treatment  of  carboplatin-paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel 
chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab in first line metastatic squamous NSCLC subjects. 
A total of 559 patients with previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC were randomized. This study 
is ongoing and data presented are coming from the IA2 with data cut-off date 3 April 2018. OS and PFS per 
RECIST 1.1 by BICR were dual primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints included ORR and DOR per 
RECIST 1.1 by BICR. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab combination over chemotherapy alone in the ITT 
population in OS (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.49, 0.85, p<0.0008) as well as in PFS per BICR by RECIST 1.1 (HR 
0.56, 95%CI 0.45, 0.70, p<0.0001).  
•  Higher  confirmed  ORR  by  RECIST  1.1  according  to  BICR  in  the  pembro  combo  arm  compared  to 
chemotherapy (57.9% vs 38.4%, p<0.0001) with longer median DOR (7.7 vs 4.8 months).  
•  Overall consistent results across subgroups, including PD-L1 subgroups.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
• 
Immaturity of OS data (OS events occurred account for 57% of that planned for the final analysis) and 
limited follow-up time (median 7.8 months). Due to the short follow-up, there is a need to confirm the 
efficacy of the combination also on later events. The MAH will submit the final study report for study 
KN-407 in order to confirm the benefit of the combination vs chemotherapy with longer FU (annex II 
condition). 
Lack of comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC patients with TPS≥50% is reflected in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
•  Due  to  the  limited  sample  size,  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy patients aged ≥ 75 years is difficult to characterise (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
In  study  KN-407,  the  safety  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  compared 
unfavourably against chemotherapy alone. Drug-related AEs, serious drug-related AEs, discontinuations 
due to either AEs or drug-related AEs and deaths, including those for whom fatalities were subsequent 
to  drug-related  AEs  (3.6%  vs  2.1%),  were  more  frequently  reported  on  combined  therapy  than 
chemotherapy alone. 
•  While  overall  Grade  3-5  AEs  occurred  with  a  similar  frequency  between  treatment  arms  (69.8%  vs 
68.2%) febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs 3.9%), hyponatremia (3.6% vs 1.8%), diarrhoea (4% vs 2.1%),  
pneumonitis  (2.5%  vs  0.4%),  colitis  (2.2%  vs  0.7%),  autoimmune  hepatitis  (1.8%  vs  0%)  and 
infusion-related reactions (1.1% vs 0.4%) were more frequent in the combined therapy than control. 
Assessment report  
EMA/223846/2019 
Page 99/103 
 
  
  
Febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs 3.6%), pneumonitis (2.5% vs 0.7%) and colitis (2.2% vs 0.4%) were also 
among the most frequent SAEs reported with a higher incidence in the pembro combo than control. 
•  With  respect  to  the  comparator,  pembro  combo  slightly  increased  the  incidence  of  fatal  respiratory 
failure (1.1% vs 0%), cardiac arrest (0.7% vs 0.4%) and sepsis (1.1% vs 0.4%).  
• 
The indirect comparison with the reference safety database also showed a worse toxicity profile than 
pembrolizumab in monotherapy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
The combination therapy appears less tolerable in elderly (≥75 years); however final conclusions are 
limited by the small patient numbers (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
KEYNOTE-407  study  interim  results  have  shown  a  relevant  clinical  advantage  of  the  addition  of 
pembrolizumab  to  carboplatin+paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel  compared  to  chemotherapy  alone  in  all  efficacy 
endpoints OS, PFS ORR and DOR. 
Compared with chemotherapy alone, the combined therapy was associated with a worse tolerability profile, 
particularly in terms of increased rate of certain drug-related events, including fatalities, although the 
incidence of grade 3-5 ADRs was similar across treatment groups. As expected, an additive effect of 
pembrolizumab has been observed on myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and alopecia which are known 
toxicities associated with carboplatin-paclitaxel combination; additionally, a higher frequency of infections 
(including sepsis), infusion-related reactions and gastrointestinal disorders were observed in pembro combo 
compared to control. The increased toxicity of pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy vs chemotherapy 
alone in the intended population is consistent with the prior experience and already authorised indication of 
pembrolizumab co-treatment with cytotoxic agents in non-squamous NSCLC patients, although some 
specific ADRs were noted to occur with increased frequency in KN-407 than KN-187 in relation to the 
different therapeutic association. AEOSIs, with particular reference to thyroid dysfunctions, hepatitis and 
pneumonitis were common events in the experimental, but not in the control arm. The indirect comparison 
with pembrolizumab monotherapy showed that the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy combination carries an 
increased toxicity across all AE categories. Therefore, careful consideration is recommended in 
treatment-decision making, particularly in the elderly patients considering that age-dependent tolerability 
has been observed as reflected in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although OS data are not yet fully mature, there is a statistically significant survival advantage and 
increased PFS of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone (4.6 months 
and 1.6 month difference respectively). This is considered to outweigh the worse tolerability profile of 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. 
Results from KEYNOTE-407 study are considered sufficient to establish a positive B/R in the sought 
indication for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with 
carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel. The MAH is expected to submit the final CSR of study KN-407 to further 
characterise the OS benefit from the combination treatment. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  Keytruda  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and  either  paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel  for  the

first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- in order to confirm the advantage of the combination compared to chemotherapy alone, including primary 
and secondary outcomes by ITT and subgroups, the MAH should submit the final CSR of KEYNOTE-407 study 
post-approval (Annex II) (projected by September 2021).

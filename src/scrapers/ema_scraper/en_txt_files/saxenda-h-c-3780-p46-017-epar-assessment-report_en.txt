1.  Introduction 
On 25 September 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (Trial NN8022-3967), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This clinical trial report was 
already submitted and assessed in 2014 under the Victoza®, liraglutide 1.8 mg procedure 
(EMEA/H/C001026).  
The following conclusions were drawn:  
• 
• 
• 
In general, for Victoza® (liraglutide 1.8 mg), trial NN8022-3967, investigating the safety and 
tolerability of liraglutide administered according to a dose-escalation scheme to a maximum 
tolerated dose of up to 3.0 mg/day (Saxenda®) for a period of 5−6 weeks in adolescents, did 
not reveal unexpected safety and tolerability issues apart from the occurrence of 
hypoglycaemia that needs further elaboration. 
For Saxenda®, the results of this phase 1 trial, can be seen as preliminary data in adolescents.   
In general, the (side) effects of Saxenda® in adolescents are in accordance with adults, with 
possibly a more pronounced effect on hypoglycaemia. 
Above assessment resulted in the use of adult dosing and dose escalation in the ongoing PIP, NN8022-
4180: “Efficacy/ safety in 12-17 year old children with primary obesity, Tanner stage 2-5”. 
It is agreed that the results from the above assessment report are largely transferable to Saxenda®.  
Trial NN8022-3967 is part of the PIP (EMEA 000128-PIP02-09) for Saxenda®, liraglutide 3 mg for 
weight management. The PIP comprises 7 studies (one quality study, one nonclinical study and 5 
clinical trials) and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Trial NN8022-3967 (hereafter referred to as 
trial 3967) is the first of the 5 planned paediatric clinical trials to be completed.   
Trial NN8022-3967 assesses the safety and tolerability of liraglutide at doses up to 3.0 mg in an obese 
adolescent population aged 12−17 years and Tanner stage 2-5. 
A Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Saxenda® (liraglutide 3.0 mg), indicated as an 
adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult 
patients was submitted to EMA on 20 December 2013 (EMEA/H/C/003780) and has received a positive 
opinion at the January 2014 meeting of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that trial NN8022-3967 is part of a paediatric investigating plan (PIP) for Saxenda® 3 
mg. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several 
studies) is expected to be submitted by 2023.  A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Liraglutide is a long-acting analogue of GLP-1. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone secreted predominantly 
from the L-cells in the lower gut in response to meal ingestion and in turn stimulating the secretion of 
endogenous insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. GLP-1 also decreases blood glucagon levels and 
slows down the gastric emptying rate leading to an increased feeling of satiety and a subsequent 
reduction in food intake. 
Liraglutide is a peptide and must be administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection to avoid its 
degradation by the stomach acid. Once daily s.c. injection is the route of administration in both the 
paediatric, adolescent and adult populations. The formulation of liraglutide used in trial 3967 was the 
same as that used in clinical trials in adults: liraglutide 6.0 mg/mL, for s.c. injection. The formulation 
contained liraglutide (6.0 mg/mL), phosphate, propylene glycol and phenol. The placebo solution 
contained the same excipients and preservatives as the active product, without the active substance. 
The formulation and the corresponding placebo solutions were clear, colourless or almost colourless 
solutions, free from turbidity. The products were delivered as solutions in 3 mL cartridges for multiple 
s.c. injections. 
All excipients in the liraglutide formulation are considered suitable for the paediatric/adolescent 
population. Based on the outcome of the paediatric trials, the optimal administration system for 
paediatric use will be made available by Novo Nordisk prior to the approval of a paediatric indication. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
NN8022-3967, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial to asses safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of liraglutide in obese adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Trial 3967 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in obese adolescents, 12−17 years 
of age and Tanner stage 2−5. A total of 21 adolescents were planned to be randomised 2:1 to 
treatment with either liraglutide or placebo. After a screening visit, the subjects entered a 5-6 week 
treatment period and 5 to 14 days after the last dose, subjects attended a follow-up visit. The total 
time from screening to follow-up was, at most, 10 weeks. Treatment with liraglutide (or the 
corresponding volume of placebo) was administered by subcutaneous injections according to a dose-
escalation schedule starting at a dose of 0.6 mg/day. The dose was then gradually increased with 0.6 
mg once weekly until the maximum tolerated dose of up to 3.0 mg/day was reached. If, during dose-
escalation, the higher dose was not tolerated, the dose was de-escalated to the previous level and the 
subject took that dose for the remainder of the treatment period. Alternatively, the subject could take 
a given dose for two weeks before escalating to the next dose level. Safety and tolerability was 
assessed during the entire trial. Pharmacokinetic blood sampling for Ctrough assessments to investigate 
dose proportionality was performed prior to the subjects taking their daily dose of liraglutide or placebo 
at visits 3 to 7 (i.e. during week 1-5). In addition, sparse pharmacokinetic blood sampling for 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (modelling) was performed after the last dose administration at 
the end of week 5 according to the specific sampling scheme that was assigned at randomisation.  
Methods 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of liraglutide at doses up to 
3 mg in the adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and Tanner stage 2-5; the secondary objectives were to 
assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide.

Study population /Sample size 
No statistical power calculation was performed. A sample size of 12 subjects randomized to liraglutide 
and 6 subjects randomized to placebo was considered sufficient to assess the primary and secondary 
objectives. In order to account for dropouts it was planned to randomize 14 subjects for the liraglutide 
treatment group and 7 subjects for the placebo group and thus a total of 21 subjects were planned for 
enrolment into the trial. The key inclusion criteria were:  
-  Male or female subjects aged 12-17 years (both inclusive) at time of randomization with 
Tanner stage 2-5 pubertal development. 
-  BMI corresponding to > 30 kg/m2 for adults by international cut-off points and < 45 kg/m2 and 
> 95th percentile for age and gender. 
- 
Fasting plasma glucose < 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). 
The key exclusion criteria: 
-  Subjects with clinically diagnosed secondary causes of childhood obesity such as chromosomal 
abnormalities (e.g., Turner syndrome), syndromic obesity (e.g., Prader Willi syndrome) or 
endocrinologic disorders (e.g., Cushing Syndrome). 
-  Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of bulimia 
-  Subjects with Tanner stage 1 development (prepubertal). 
-  Diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as judged by the investigator. 
- 
Previous treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., exenatide or liraglutide or other), DPP-4 
inhibitors, orlistat or other weight lowering medication, any antipsychotic medication or 
systemic corticosteroids within the last 3 months. 
-  Currently using or have used within 3 months before screening for this trial: any systemic 
treatment that in the opinion of the investigator interferes with pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic and safety endpoints. 
-  Surgical treatment for obesity. 
- 
Past or current chronic or idiopathic pancreatitis or any of the following: amylase or lipase 
above 2 times upper normal range; triglycerides above 500 mg/dl; calcium above upper 
normal range; history of gallstones (not treated by cholecystectomy). 
-  Uncontrolled treated or untreated hypertension 99th percentile for age and gender in children. 
-  History of major depressive disorder or history of other severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) that could in the opinion of the investigator interfere with 
trial compliance or subject safety. 
-  Subjects with a history of suicide attempts or history of any suicidal behaviour within the past 
month before entry into the trial.

Treatments 
Treatment with liraglutide (or the corresponding volume of placebo) was initiated at a dose of 0.6 
mg/day. The dose was escalated in 0.6 mg weekly steps to a maximum tolerated dose of up to 3.0 
mg/day. The dose was not escalated if the subject had had fasting plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/L (56 
mg/dL) or < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the presence of symptoms of hypoglycaemia in the previous 
week. Furthermore, the dose was escalated only if the previous dose was tolerated with respect to 
gastrointestinal AEs, as judged by the investigator. In case of tolerability issues, the dose could be 
down-titrated and the subject could stay on that lower dose for the rest of the trial or the treatment 
period could be prolonged for an extra week (i.e., a total period of 6 weeks), allowing subjects to 
remain at one dose for up to a maximum of two weeks before escalating the dose. After the last dose 
and sampling for pharmacokinetics, the subjects attended a follow-up visit. The total time from 
screening to follow-up was, at most, 10 weeks. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was:                                                                                                    
Number of treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) recorded from the time of first dosing and until 
completion of the follow-up visit. 
The secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints were: 
- At steady state at each dose step: Ctrough 
- At steady state (last dose day): model derived AUCτ (area under the pharmacokinetic curve at steady 
state from 0-24 hours), t½ (plasma half-life), CL/F (apparent clearance), V/F (apparent volume of 
distribution) 
The explorative PD secondary endpoints were: 
- Change from baseline to end of treatment in BMI z-score 
- Change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight 
- Change from baseline to end of treatment in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and serum insulin 
• 
Statistical Methods 
Full analysis set (FAS) – all subjects who were randomized and had received at least one dose of the 
trial product. In exceptional cases, subjects could be excluded from the FAS. In such cases the 
exclusion was justified and documented. The Safety analysis set (SAS) is identical to the FAS.  
No formal statistical testing was performed for any of the safety or tolerability endpoints and summary 
statistics by treatment were the primary mode of statistical presentation of safety data. 
The change from baseline to end-of-treatment for all PD endpoints was analyzed using an ANCOVA 
model with treatment as fixed factor and baseline value as covariate. 
CHMP comments: 
The proposed analysis sets are considered acceptable for a trial aimed at safety/tolerability, PK and 
PD. Safety and tolerability will assessed using summary statistics and changes in BMI z-score will be 
tested using a linear model, which is acceptable. However it is not clear how patients withdrawing 
from the trial will be handled in the PD analysis. From the results it appears the PD analyses were 
based on observed cases and thus more using a per protocol analysis set. Nevertheless, since this

concerns secondary exploratory endpoints this can be acceptable.

Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total, 24 obese adolescents were screened; 3 subjects were screening failures; 14 subjects were 
randomized and exposed to liraglutide (3 boys and 11 girls) and 7 were randomized and exposed to 
placebo (4 boys and 3 girls). One subject withdrew from treatment after 4 days of treatment due to a 
storage temperature deviation of trial product at site. 20 subjects completed the trial. Mean exposure 
to treatment was similar between treatment groups and was 33.3 days (median: 35 days) in the 
liraglutide group and 35.4 days (median: 35 days) in the placebo group. Except for one subject who 
reached 2.4 mg of liraglutide, subjects reached a maximum of 3.0 mg. 
CHMP comments: 
In the liraglutide group, an imbalance between boys and girls was reported with 78.6% females in this 
group. As sex was identified as a relevant covariate for exposure (lower exposure in males), this 
might have influenced the results. Except for one subject, the study population reached a maximum 
dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide.  
The exposure to the maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide in this trial was only one week. As adverse 
events are the most profound after starting treatment, this period is acceptable for a first evaluation 
of safety in children. 
• 
Baseline data 
The two treatment groups (liraglutide and placebo) had similar distribution with regard to demographic 
and baseline characteristics. The mean age was 15 years (ranging between 13 and 17 years), the 
mean body weight was 105.5 kg (78.5 to 164.4 kg), mean BMI was 36.2 kg/m2 (29.3 to 44.9 kg/m2) 
and mean BMI z-score was 3.20 (2.50 to 4.52). Most of the enrolled subjects were Tanner stage 5 or 4 
of pubertal development and few were Tanner stage 3. No subjects were Tanner stage 2. See Table 2.

Safety results 
TEAE:                                                                                                                                        
More treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in the liraglutide group compared to 
the placebo group; 14 subjects (100%) in the liraglutide group reported 86 TEAEs during the trial 
compared to 4 subjects (57%) in the placebo group reporting 7 TEAEs. The majority of the TEAEs 
Saxenda 
Page 10/30 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in the liraglutide group were mild in severity (83 mild events corresponding to 97% of all 
reported TEAEs in the liraglutide group); 3 of the TEAEs (3%) were moderate. In the placebo group, all 
reported TEAEs were mild. No severe TEAEs were reported in any of the treatment groups. 
Approximately half (44 TEAEs corresponding to 51%) of the TEAEs reported in the liraglutide group 
were considered to have a causal relationship to the treatment whereas none of the reported TEAEs 
were considered as related to the treatment in the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
in the liraglutide group were from the system organ class (SOC) ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ with 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea representing the most common preferred terms within 
this SOC. No clear association between dose, timing and duration of the gastrointestinal TEAEs was 
observed in the present short-term trial. None of the reported TEAEs led to withdrawal of subjects from 
the trial. No deaths or other SAEs were reported during the trial. 
Table 3. Summary of treatment emergent adverse events – safety analysis set 
CHMP comments: 
Treatment with liraglutide was well-tolerated in the present obese adolescent trial population and no 
unexpected safety and tolerability issues were identified compared to adults. Liraglutide was tolerated 
up to 3.0 mg, except for one subject who tolerated 2.4 mg due to recurrent hypoglycaemia.  
Although, liraglutide 3.0 mg was tolerated, all (100%) treated subjects experienced side effects, most 
frequently mild gastrointestinal disorders, as judged by the investigator. Non-serious hypoglycaemia 
were not reported as AE, but reported on hypoglycaemic forms.

Hypoglycaemia: 
- 
For one subject in the liraglutide group, dose-escalation was postponed due to hypoglycaemic 
episodes and this subject only reached a maximum dose of 2.4 mg liraglutide. 
-  More hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group; 
12 hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 8 subjects in the liraglutide group compared to 2 
episodes in 1 subject in the placebo group. No severe episodes occurred in any of the 
treatment groups. Most of the episodes in the liraglutide group occurred at liraglutide doses of 
0.6 mg and 1.2 mg.

CHMP comments: 
At visit 1 and 7, plasma glucose concentration was measured. However, the glucose measurements 
during the trial were performed with a glucometer by the subject. From glucometers it is known that 
they show a wide variability in glucose measurements and most often they measure capillary glucose, 
which may differ from whole blood or plasma glucose measurements. The data on hypoglycaemia 
should be interpreted with caution. 
The subject who tolerated 2.4 mg only, experienced nausea throughout the trial, as well as recurrent 
hypoglycaemia. Future trials with liraglutide 3.0 mg in adolescents have to make clear if 
hypoglycaemia is a recurrent problem in this specific treatment group. In this trial, 57% of the 
subjects with liraglutide experienced hypoglycaemia versus 14 % in the placebo group. The majority 
of hypoglycaemia occurred at the lower liraglutide doses and no severe hypoglycaemia was observed. 
The glucoses measured with glucometer defined as hypoglycaemia are common values in adolescents 
and may be a variant of normal. 
Laboratory results: 
-  One CLAE (clinical laboratory adverse event) (elevated transaminase ) was reported. An 
increase in serum ALAT of 20.5 U/l at baseline to 36.2 U/l at end of treatment (normal range 
8-29 U/l) was reported.  
-  Otherwise no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, physical examination and 
ECG were observed.  
- 
Few subjects in the liraglutide group had elevated levels of LDH (4 subjects), lipase (2 
subjects) and amylase (1 subject) at some points during the trial. The maximum amylase level 
was 147.1 U/l end of treatment (normal range 28.0-100.0 U/l). 
-  No anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected during the trial. 
- 
CHMP comments: 
One subject with number experienced an increase in lipase and amylase without signs of pancreatitis. 
This phenomenon  is also observed in the adult trials. The development of anti-liraglutide antibodies 
after long-term treatment can not be excluded due to the short duration of the trial. The subject with 
elevated transaminase, experienced elevated SGOT, LDH and potassium 6.9 mmol/l as well, without 
an elevation in creatinine, which might be explained by hemolysis in the tube. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics results 
Pharmacokinetic 
Dose proportionality of liraglutide was investigated based on Ctrough values by estimation of the slope β 
in a linear normal regression model. For the analysis, Ctrough values were logarithmically transformed 
and analysed via population PK modelling. The estimate reported from the analysis was the quantity 2β 
and the resulting p-value represents the test of 2β = 2 (i.e., if 2β = 2, this means that doubling the 
dose of liraglutide results in a doubling of the exposure). 
Saxenda 
Page 13/30 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood samples were drawn at specific time points during the trial for liraglutide concentration analysis 
in order to investigate PK parameters of the treatment. 
One blood sample was drawn prior to subjects taking their daily dose of IMP at visit 3 to 7 (i.e., during 
week 1-5, see Figure 9–1) in order to obtain trough values (Ctrough) at steady state at each dose-
escalation step in order to assess dose-proportionality. 
In addition, subjects were randomised to one of six different PK blood sampling schemes (A−F, see 
Table below) at the randomisation visit (visit 2). Within 24 hours of the last dose administration at visit 
7 at the end of week 5, 4 samples were drawn per subject and, in addition, one sample was drawn at 
48 or 72 hours for population PK analysis (sparse PK blood sampling). The actual time of blood 
sampling was not to deviate by more than: ± 10 minutes for the 2- and 4-hour samples, ±30 minutes 
for the 6-, 8- and 10-hour samples, ± 1 hour for the 12- and 14-hour samples and +12 hours (up to 
12 hours after the specified time) for the 24-, 48- and 72-hour samples. 
Population Pharmacokinetic analysis: 
The objective of the population PK analysis was to investigate the PK properties of liraglutide 3.0 mg in 
obese adolescents and compare it with steady state PK data from a previous trial with liraglutide 3.0 
mg in obese adults (NN8022-3630). The possible relationship between drug exposure and selected 
markers of pharmacodynamic (PD) effect after 5 weeks of treatment (including escalation) was 
explored. 
A summary of the data and trial characteristics for subjects included in the population PK analysis is 
shown in Table 5 below. 
Table 5. Summary of the data and trial characteristics for subjects in trials NN8022-3967 
and NN8022-3630 included in the population PK analysis. 
Study NN8022-3630 was according the modelling report a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-
blind, incomplete cross-over design trial to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on gastric emptying,

energy expenditure and appetite, and to evaluate liraglutide PK in obese adults.                        
Twenty nine subjects were randomised and exposed to liraglutide 3.0 mg.  In brief, the subjects 
included in the trial were adult (age 18 to 75) males and females with a BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 and < 40.0 
kg/m2 and a FPG < 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Subjects were randomised to treatment sequence A, B, 
C, D, E or F: 
Sequence A: 3.0 mg liraglutide followed by 1.8 mg liraglutide 
Sequence B: 1.8 mg liraglutide followed by 3.0 mg liraglutide 
Sequence C: 1.8 mg liraglutide followed by placebo (3.0 mg) 
Sequence D: Placebo (3.0 mg) followed by 1.8 mg liraglutide 
Sequence E: 3.0 mg liraglutide followed by placebo (1.8 mg) 
Sequence F: Placebo (1.8 mg) followed by 3.0 mg liraglutide 
Subjects went through a 3 or 5 step dose escalation for the 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg liraglutide treatment, 
respectively. Between the two treatment periods there was a washout period of 6-8 weeks. Subjects 
were given an initial 0.6 mg daily dose of liraglutide, and this dose was increased once weekly to 1.2 
mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg and finally 3.0 mg. Blood samples for measuring the liraglutide plasma 
concentration were sampled for 60 hours after the last dose, starting at day 37 after start of treatment 
(35 days of treatment at home plus two additional days of dosing during the in-house stay). Single 
blood samples for plasma concentrations of liraglutide were drawn at trough on day 36, at trough on 
day 37 (in the evening, this dose defined as time=0), then at 2, 4, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 
60 h after the last dose. 
The following data was explored in the PK model: 
NN8022-3967: All available plasma concentration measurements of liraglutide, exact time and amount 
of all doses administered throughout the trial, as well as demographic covariates (baseline body 
weight, sex, age category (adolescent) and PD markers (change from baseline in body weight, BMI Z-
score and FPG). 
NN8022-3630: Liraglutide plasma concentrations obtained from serial sampling following the last 
liraglutide (3.0 mg) dose at day 35 (when steady state concentrations are reached), with dose and 
exact time after dose for each blood sample. Demographic covariates included body weight, sex, age 
category (adult) and change from baseline in body weight. 
Base PK model: 
The base model was used for justifying the structural model and as a base for the covariate analysis. 
A standard one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to describe 
the liraglutide PK. The structural model was parameterized in terms of the following parameters: 
•  KA (absorption rate constants for liraglutide), 
•  CL/F (apparent clearance for liraglutide), 
•  V/F (apparent volume of distribution for liraglutide). 
A proportional error model was used to describe the residual variability of liraglutide concentrations.

The full covariate model containing the investigated covariates was used for obtaining point estimates 
and CI for all investigated covariate effects and for obtaining parameter estimates for quantifying 
covariate effects. 
The covariate analysis included effects on CL/F and V/F. An alternative model including covariate 
effects on CL/F and the KA was investigated in a sensitivity analysis.

Results 
Pharmacokinetics Study NN8022-3967 
Dose proportionality 
In the table below (Table 6) the mean Ctrough values are listed of the subjects measured on each 
visiting day (escalating doses) in this study and in Error! Reference source not found. the individual 
date are presented and fitted to estimate the dose proportionality of the pharmacokinetics of 
liraglutide. 
Table 6. Liraglutide plasma concentration, trough values - descriptive statistics 
Figure 3. Dose proportionality based on Ctrough values (The fitted curve is based on the 
estimates from the linear regression model) 
The liraglutide concentration did not appear to increase in a dose-proportional manner, i.e. the 
estimated 2β with corresponding 95% CI was 1.75 (1.55; 1.98), p = 0.03 indicating that a doubling of 
the liraglutide dose resulted in a 1.75 times increase in exposure (Ctrough). 
Investigating the dose proportionality of liraglutide based on the Ctrough values in a linear normal 
regression model indicated that the liraglutide concentration did not increase in a dose-proportional 
manner mainly due to unexpected low Ctrough values at the 2.4 mg liraglutide dose. When excluding all 
Ctrough values at the dose of 2.4 mg in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the increase in liraglutide

concentration with increasing dose was however consistent with dose-proportionality. The reason for 
the unexpected low Ctrough values at the 2.4 mg liraglutide dose is not known. 
CHMP comments: 
The results of the study in adolescent patients demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide 
can be considered as linear but not fully dose proportional. However, the deviation from dose 
proportionality in this patients group is considered not clinical relevant. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis: 
A total of 964 records from 42 subjects were included in the population PK analysis set. Thirteen 
subjects were from trial NN8022-3967 (adolescents) and 29 subjects were from trial NN8022-3630 
(adults). 
Figure 4 shows the individual concentration-time profiles for subjects in the two trials (NN8022-3967 
and NN8022-3630) included in the analysis and

Table 7. Model derived pharmacokinetic variables of liraglutide in adolescent and adult 
patients. 
The PK of liraglutide could be described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination. The structural PK model was parameterized with KA, CL/F and V/F with between-subject 
variability parameters on CL/F and V/F, including covariance between the random-effect parameters. 
The residual error was described by a proportional error model. 
The estimated parameters for the full covariate model are shown in Table 8. 
Table 8. Parameter estimates of the full model 
The model fit was acceptable and there were no critical trends in the conditional weighted residuals vs. 
neither liraglutide concentration nor time. The individual CL/F and V/F estimates appeared to 
approximate normal distributions. (See Figure 5 and Figure 4 below)

exposure in the covariate analysis with a 23% (90% CI: 8; 35%) lower exposure in male subjects 
compared to females (Figure 5). In addition, there was a reduced exposure with increasing body 
weight (the mean exposure with the highest body weight in the dataset [130 kg] was 11% [90% CI: -
23; 2%] lower and the lowest body weight in the dataset [70 kg] was 17% [90% CI: -3; 42%] higher 
compared to the reference body weight of 100 kg) and a slightly higher exposure in adolescents 
compared to adults (obese adolescents had a mean difference in exposure of 10% [90% CI: -7; 31%] 
compared to adults).

CHMP comments: 
The performed pharmacokinetic population analysis on the data of studies in adults and adolescent 
demonstrates that the exposure to liraglutide in adults and adolescents (12 -17 year) is similar. 
Pharmacodynamic 
In general, no statistically significant treatment effect of liraglutide was demonstrated for any of the 
pharmacodynamic endpoints ( BMI z-score, Body weight,  Fasting blood glucose,  HbA1c, Serum 
insulin) probably due to the short duration of treatment and low number of subjects. (Error!

Saxenda

liraglutide. None were in favour of placebo.

Figure 5 Mean body weight - change from baseline - mean longitudinal plot - full analysis set 
The relationship between exposure and the pharmacodynamic parameters BMI z-score, body weight 
and fasting blood glucose after 5 weeks of treatment (including dose-escalation) was explored 
according to a specific request by the PDCO. No obvious trends of increasing response with increasing 
exposure were observed for any of these pharmacodynamic parameters in adolescents after 5 weeks of 
treatment (
Saxenda 
Page 25/30 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 9) The same pattern was observed for weight and plasma fasting glucose. The data should be 
interpreted with caution due to the low number of subjects included in the trial and the short treatment 
duration leading to low response.

weeks of treatment – FAS 
In the liraglutide group, the resting pulse was numerically increased from baseline to end-of treatment 
(mean change from baseline: 6 beats/minute ranging from -20 to 24 beats/minute) moving towards 
baseline values at follow-up. In the placebo group, mean change in resting pulse increased by 1 
beat/minute (ranging from -10 to 15 beats/minutes.

CHMP comments: 
As the MAH stated, a favourable effect was observed for change in weight for liraglutide versus 
placebo. However, after finishing liraglutide treatment, the weight increased in the liraglutide group. 
Future research is needed to conclude whether liraglutide can sustain the weight loss. 
In accordance with adult data, a mean change of 6 beats/min in heart frequency was observed. The 
clinical relevance for the paediatric population can not be determined.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In this specific trial in adolescents, with a mean age of 15 years, a mean body weight of 105.5 kg 
(78.5 to 164.4 kg), mean BMI was 36.2 kg/m2 (29.3 to 44.9 kg/m2) and most with Tanner stage 5 or 
4, more TEAE were observed in the treatment group. 14 of 14 (100%) subjects experienced 86 events 
in total, which were most often mild gastro intestinal complaints, compared to 4 of 7 subjects on 
placebo who experienced 7 events in total.  The exposure to the maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide 
in this trial was only one week.  As adverse events are the most profound after starting treatment, this 
period is acceptable for a first evaluation of safety in the paediatric population. 
More hypoglycaemia was present in the liraglutide group. 8 of 14 subjects experienced 12 events, 
compared to 1 subjects of 7, experiencing 2 hypoglycaemic events in the placebo group. No severe 
hypoglycaemia was observed and most hypoglycaemia cases were observed at lower doses and were 
only mild.  However, due to recurrent hypoglycaemia, one subject did not reach 3.0 mg liraglutide, but 
received 2.4 mg maximum. Because glucose measurements were performed with a glucometer during 
the trial, these data should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to conclude on the 
magnitude of this problem in this specific treatment group. 
In one subject, combined lipase and amylase increase was observed in the liraglutide group, which is 
also observed in the adult population. No liraglutide antibodies were observed. 
Regarding vital signs, resting pulse was found to be numerically increased and systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was numerically lowered in the liraglutide group compared to placebo. The clinical 
significance of these changes in pulse and blood pressure is not known. However, this phenomenon is 
also observed in adults.  The long-term effects of liraglutide on cardiovascular outcomes and other 
clinically important events, were examined in 9340 adult patients in the LEADER trial (the Liraglutide 
Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results). The rate of the first 
occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke 
occurred in significantly fewer patients in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for 
noninferiority; p=0.01 for superiority). 
Although most of the explorative PD endpoints tended to be numerically in favour of liraglutide no 
statistically significant treatment effect was demonstrated the BMI Z-score, body weight, fasting 
plasma glucose, HbA1c and serum insulin after 5 weeks of treatment (including dose-escalation). 
Remarkably, a rise in weight was observed after finishing liraglutide treatment. 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, it is agreed with the applicant that exposure associated with 3.0 mg 
liraglutide was found to be comparable between the adolescents studied in this clinical trial and what 
has been demonstrated in adult subjects. There is an overlap between the concentration-time profiles 
from adolescents and adults, as observed in the compared trials (NN8022-3967 and NN8022-3630). 
Saxenda 
Page 28/30 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Additionally, this was confirmed in the pharmacokinetic modelling. After correcting for the difference in 
sex ratio between trial populations, the exposure determined in adolescents was similar to the 
exposure in adults. 
Further, results of the study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide can be considered 
linear, but not fully dose proportional. The deviation from dose proportionality in this patient group is 
considered not clinical relevant.  
Overall conclusion 
Trial NN8022-3967, investigating the safety and tolerability of liraglutide administered according to a 
dose-escalation scheme to a maximum tolerated dose of up to 3.0 mg/day (Saxenda) for a period of 
5−6 weeks in adolescents, did not reveal unexpected safety and tolerability issues apart from the 
occurrence of hypoglycaemia that needs further exploration. Exposure associated with 3.0 mg 
liraglutide was found to be comparable between the adolescents studied and adult subjects. 
Trial NN8022-3967 is part of the PIP (EMEA/H/C/003780) for Saxenda®, liraglutide 3 mg for weight 
management. The PIP comprises 7 studies (one quality study, one nonclinical study and 5 clinical 
trials) and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Trial NN8022-3967 is the first of the 5 planned 
paediatric clinical trials to be completed. 
Trial NN8022-4181, recently completed, assessed the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of liraglutide administered according to a dose-escalation schedule until a 
maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide or maximum tolerated dose; for a period of 7 weeks (with option 
to prolong up to 13 weeks in case a flex week was needed) in obese children aged 7 to 11 years, did 
also not reveal unexpected safety and tolerability issues. 
The results of the other paediatric clinical trials has to be waited for, to draw definite conclusions, 
especially in the context of hypoglycaemia. In general, the side effects of Saxenda in the adolescent 
population aged 12−17 years are in accordance with adults, with possibly a more pronounced effect on 
hypoglycaemia, which need a further exploration.

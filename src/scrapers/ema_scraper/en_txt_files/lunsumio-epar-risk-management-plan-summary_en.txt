Summary of Risk Management Plan for Lunsumio (Mosunetuzumab) 
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab).  
The RMP details important risks of Lunsumio, how these risks can be minimized, and 
how more information will be obtained about Lunsumio’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Lunsumio’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Lunsumio should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Lunsumio should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Lunsumio’s RMP. 
I.  THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Lunsumio as monotherapy is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic 
therapies (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains mosunetuzumab as the active 
substance, and is administered as an intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Lunsumio’s benefits can be found in 
Lunsumio’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
Website, under the medicine’s Web Page. 
II.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Lunsumio, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Lunsumio’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorized pack size⎯The amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
The medicine’s legal status⎯The way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
 
In the case of Lunsumio, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk-minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks below: 
•  Patient Card  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lunsumio is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Lunsumio are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lunsumio.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Cytokine release syndrome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Non-clinical studies showing transient T-cell activation and 
cytokine release and in clinical studies, the majority of 
CRS events occurred in the first cycle of mosunetuzumab 
administration, mostly associated either with Day 1 or Day 
15 doses and evidence is also based on Study GO29781. 
Patient-specific factors which may account for the greater 
likelihood to have excessive cytokine release are yet to be 
clearly defined but may include tumor burden, 
peripheral/circulating target cells, higher levels of 
macrophages or monocytes or the presence of hyperactive 
T-cells primed to react.

Important Identified Risk: Tumor flare 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Evidence is based on Study GO29781.  
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Tumor flare events tend to occur within the first few weeks 
following mosunetuzumab administration. In addition, 
depending on tumor size and anatomic location, tumor 
flare may potentially result in mass effects on vital 
structures including airways, major blood vessels, 
gastrointestinal tract (risk of perforation and hemorrhage), 
and/or major organs.

Important Identified Risk: Serious Infections 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Nonclinical chronic toxicity study showed infections that 
were deemed secondary to immunosuppression due to 
mosunetuzumab-induced prolonged B-cell depletion and 
evidence is also based on Study GO29781. 
Serious infections is a recognized risk associated with B-
cell depletion treatment effect and a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological 
malignancies.  Underlying medical conditions in the patient 
population including history of recurring or chronic 
infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus) and 
prior immunosuppressive treatment are risk factors that 
may predispose to infections.

II.C Post-Authorization Development Plan 
II.C.1 Studies that are Conditions of the Marketing Authorization 
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorization. 
Study short name: Study GO42909  
Purpose of the study: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of M+Len 
compared with R+Len in patients with R/R FL who were treated with at least one prior 
systemic therapy. 
II.C.2 Other Studies in Post-Authorization Development Plan 
There is one other study in the post-authorization development plan for Lunsumio: 
Study short name: Study GO42909  
Purpose of the study: Phase III randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating 
efficacy and safety of mosunetuzumab in combination with lenalidomide (M+Len) in 
comparison to rituximab in combination with lenalidomide (R+Len) in patients with 
follicular lymphoma after at least one line of systemic therapy. In this case, this study will 
be used to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of mosunetuzumab, which will 
address the missing information of long-term safety of mosunetuzumab.

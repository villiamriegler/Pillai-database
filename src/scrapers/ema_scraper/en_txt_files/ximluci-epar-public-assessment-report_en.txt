2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Ximluci has been developed as a biosimilar to the EU reference product Lucentis, solution for injection 
(active substance INN: ranibizumab). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ranibizumab, the active substance in Ximluci, is a humanised monoclonal antibody fragment produced 
in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Ximluci is presented as solution for intravitreal injection in a single-use vial. Each vial contains 2.3 mg 
of ranibizumab in 0.23 mL solution (strength 10 mg/mL). This provides a usable amount to deliver a 
single dose of 0.05 mL containing 0.5 mg ranibizumab to adult patients. 
Ximluci is intended to be administered using, a sterile syringe and an injection needle (both provided 
separately). A filter needle for withdrawal of Ximluci from the vial is co-packaged for one of the two 
authorised presentations. 
Ranibizumab is formulated with trehalose dihydrate, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, histidine, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
Ximluci has been developed as a biosimilar to Lucentis (EMEA/H/C/000715). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General information 
Ranibizumab is an antibody-binding fragment (Fab) of a recombinant humanised IgG1 kappa isotype 
monoclonal antibody. The active substance contains a light chain with 214 amino acids and a heavy 
chain with 231 amino acids. The two polypeptide chains are linked via an inter-chain disulphide bond. 
Ranibizumab does not contain the Fc region that is involved in antibody-mediated effector functions 
and there are no N-glycosylation sites in the molecule.  
The fully assembled product has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa. 
The active substance binds with high affinity to VEGF-A (in particular to isoforms VEGF110, VEGF121, 
VEGF165 and VEGF189) which are the major biologically active isoforms involved in the pathological 
process of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at UAB Biotechnologines, Mokslininku str, Vilnius, Lithuania. All 
sites involves in manufacture, QC testing and storage of the cell banks and active substance operate in 
accordance with EU GMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 12/125 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process is a standard production process for a recombinant antibody-type protein. 
One single active substance batch is produced from one fed-batch fermentation using a production 
scale bioreactor. At the end of cultivation, the temperature of the cell suspension is reduced, and the 
cells are disrupted using a high-pressure homogeniser. No pooling of harvests is performed. The 
purification process includes a series of chromatographic steps The active substance is stored in the 
container closure system. Single use materials (e.g. bags and filters) and their material of construction 
are defined. There is no reprocessing performed.  
Control of materials  
The raw materials for the upstream and downstream process are described, including their 
pharmacopoeial standards. Specifications are presented for non-compendial materials and are 
appropriate. The materials used to formulate the active substance are tested according to the Ph. Eur. 
No raw materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process. The quantitative 
composition of the cell culture media and solutions is provided. Membranes  and resins used in the 
downstream process are specified in this section of the dossier and appropriate specifications are 
defined for these materials.  
The construction of the expression plasmid, is adequately described and followed a standard approach. 
The expression plasmid was fully sequenced after cloning and the sequence is presented in the dossier.  
The source, history and generation of the cell substrate is sufficiently described.  
A two-tiered cell banking system is in place. Overall, the MCB and WCB have been appropriately 
characterised and homogeneity of the cell banks has been established. The approach follows the 
recommendations of ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D.Non-compendial test methods for screening of cell banks 
are described and confirmation provided that they are suitably qualified. In addition, information from 
the end-of-production-cell-bank (EOPCB) is provided and demonstrates the genetic stability between 
the WCB and cells at the maximum fermentation time (limit of in vitro cell age). The stability of the cell 
banks on long-term storage is sufficiently justified and a protocol for ongoing monitoring of cell bank 
stability has been registered. The procedure for generation and qualification of future working cell 
banks is acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) are defined with associated 
acceptance criteria. All other parameters are assigned set-point values throughout the manufacturing 
process description. The manufacturing process is adequately described and includes sufficient detail 
regarding process parameters and IPCs. IPC methods have been appropriately qualified. And the active 
substance batch size has been registered. 
Process validation  
In general, active substance process validation is acceptable. Consecutive active substance process 
validation batches were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site.  Otherwise, all 
CPPs, PPs and IPCs passed during process validation. The results of the extended testing during 
upstream process validation are consistent and support a well-controlled process, e.g. consistent 
growth profiles, yield, culture purity and plasmid retention. Data is presented supporting sufficient 
clearance of process- and product-related impurities during the downstream process. Storage 
conditions and hold times of in-process intermediates were evaluated and support the hold times 
registered to 3.2.S.2.4. A protocol for confirmation of the membrane/resin lifetimes at commercial 
scale has been registered. The protocol is acceptable. Active substance shipping has been qualified in 
accordance with relevant standards.  
Manufacturing process development

The main change introduced for the commercial process was the implementation of a new WCB lot 
which was derived from the existing MCB used to manufacture the phase 3 clinical batches.  
Comparability data is presented which shows that the quality and stability of commercial active 
substance, phase 3 active substance and pre-phase 3 active substance are highly similar. Some minor 
differences were observed in quality attributes but, generally, there is an increase in purity of the 
active substance across development. The comparability analysis is based on a comparison of results 
of release tests and stability profiles. However, the extended characterisation performed as part of the 
analytical similarity exercise presented in 3.2.R includes both phase 3 and commercial finished product 
batches. Overall, the data supports that the materials are comparable as no significant differences are 
observed across the quality attributes evaluated and ranges observed.  
Control strategy and process characterisation  
The selected critical quality attributes (CQA) are appropriately justified in the dossier and are in line 
with the general expectations for this type of product. The impact of the process on the identified CQAs 
was evaluated during process characterisation. A risk assessment of all process parameters in the 
manufacturing process of the active substance was performed using a failure modes and effects 
analysis (FMEA) to identify potential CPPs (pCPPs). The scoring system for the FMEA and the cut-off 
threshold for the risk priority number (RPN) are discussed in the dossier and are acceptable. In 
general, relevant process parameters were considered during the risk evaluation and the approach is 
supported by the provided FMEA report.  
Potential CPPs which were likely to have independent effects from other CPPs were first examined in a 
PP influence assessment study (PPIA). Those PPs determined to be critical in the PPIA were then 
studied in the CPP/CQA linkage study using a design of experiments (DOE) approach to evaluate their 
impact on CQAs. Overall, the general approach to process characterisation is acceptable. The 
acceptance ranges studied for the CPPs are consistent with the ranges registered to the control 
strategy in sections 3.2.S.2.2 and 3.2.S.2.4 of the dossier. The small scale models used throughout 
process characterisation have been justified with respect to their representativeness for the 
commercial scale process. The PPIA studies were provided for a number of steps and support that the 
PPs selected for further characterisation according to DOE are appropriate. The criteria applied during 
the DOE studies for designating a pCPP as a CPP follow a standard approach and are acceptable. The 
magnitude of effect of a pCPP on a CQA was interpreted from the effect plots of statistically generated 
models. A pCPP was designated as critical when the magnitude of effect was substantial within the 
range studied, according to the model. Responses were considered to have low magnitude of effect in 
cases where the variability of the responses obtained within the studied pCPP range was smaller or 
similar to the analytical variation expected. 
The control strategy for the upstream process does not include any CPPs which has been justified.  It is 
agreed that the feed profiles, culture durations, and control strategies applied in the upstream process 
result in a highly reproducible and robust fermentation process, as evidenced by observed ranges from 
historical batches.  
In general, the control strategy for the downstream process includes appropriate CPPs during the 
chromatography steps. In addition, maximum resin cycles are defined as a CPPs for all 
chromatography steps.  
The small-scale studies performed to support the biochemical stability of the process intermediate hold 
times were provided and are acceptable. Hold times for process intermediates have been defined as 
CPPs and are justified. The small-scale studies to support the resin life-times have been provided and 
are acceptable. An extractable study was performed for the active substance container closure is 
briefly described and no organic or inorganic compounds were detected above the level of toxicological

concern. A risk assessment has been presented regarding the risk of extractables and leachables from 
product contact materials during the active substance manufacturing process and includes results of 
extractable studies, where relevant. No particular risk has been identified.  
Characterisation  
The active substance has been appropriately characterised with respect to primary, secondary and 
higher order structure, binding properties and bioactivity, size distribution, charge distribution and 
hydrophobic/hydrophilic species. A range of physicochemical and biological tests were used. Binding 
characteristics and reporter gene assay activity of ranibizumab against VEGF-A isoforms 165, 110, 121 
and 189 were evaluated. In addition, the bioactivity of the active substance against the predominant 
VEGF-A isoform 165 was characterised using a HUVEC proliferation assay. Numerous and orthogonal 
methods were used to evaluate primary, secondary and tertiary structure. N-linked glycans have not 
been specifically analysed which is acceptable because the molecule lacks the Fc region and does not 
contain any amino acid motifs typical for N-glycosylation. In addition, glycation of lysine residues and 
O-linked glycosylation was not observed.  
Process-related impurities are derived from the manufacturing process and are either (i) cleared to 
acceptable levels according to the results of process validation or (ii) routinely controlled at IPC or 
release testing. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications  
Specifications for the active substance include control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and 
other general tests. 
The active substance specification testing panel is generally appropriate. The specifications have been 
justified using an appropriate number of active substance batches. There is no particular trend 
observed on long-term stability and, thus, a single set of acceptance criteria based on mean -3SD for 
limit tests and mean ± 3SD for potency is defined in release and shelf life specifications. In general, 
the approach is agreed as specifications are relatively tight.  
While, in principle, the specifications for control of impurities are acceptable, it was requested to revise 
the acceptance criteria for impurities to report to one decimal place and this has been done. It was 
requested to tighten the proposed specification for osmolality in line with the requested tightening of 
the acceptance criteria for osmolality in the finished product specifications and this has been done. 
The proposed acceptance criteria for potency are consistent with the method variability observed on 
stability. The proposed potency specification is based on results from the analytical potency method 
used during development. The proposal to base the commercial potency specifications on results from 
an earlier version of the assay was queried. A detailed explanation of the differences between the two 
versions of the potency assay has been provided along with a justification as to why these differences 
are unlikely to impact on the potency results obtained with either method. The methods are essentially 
equivalent although the later version was improved to increase assay robustness. In addition, a 
bridging study was performed to establish equivalence of the potency methods. Results with the two 
methods were compared in a two-tailed paired samples t-test and the methods were found to be 
comparable. The data presented supports the equivalence of the methods. The proposal to retain both 
versions of the assay in the dossier is acceptable.  
Overall, the active substance specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 15/125 
 
 
 
Compendial methods are used for clarity, colour, bacterial endotoxins, microbial enumeration, pH, and 
osmolality. Non-compendial methods are briefly described in the dossier. In general, the method 
descriptions are sufficiently detailed and include relevant details regarding equipment, reagents, 
operating conditions, sample and standard preparation, assay controls and system of suitability.  
The method validation summaries provided in the dossier confirm that validation is generally in line 
with ICH Q2. Quality control (QC) methods will be performed at the site of method validation.  
The potency assay is sufficiently described and the controls are appropriate to ensure consistent assay 
performance. The potency assay has been appropriately validated including an evaluation of 
robustness across different lots of critical reagents.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is presented for several active substance batches manufactured across process 
development and commercial process. All batches comply with the specifications in place at the time of 
testing.  
Reference standards  
A primary reference standard (PRS) has been generated from a commercial active substance lot and is 
qualified against the previous interim reference standard. The PRS is stored and will be retested 
regularly against a subset of the qualification tests addressing potency and purity. The interim 
reference standard has been appropriately qualified including the extended characterisation as 
described in section 3.2.S.3.1. Working reference standards can be generated and used for 
requalification of PRS and release of commercial batches. 
The testing panels for qualification of new reference standards or re-qualification of existing references 
(both PRS and working reference standard (WRS)) have been defined and are generally acceptable. In 
addition, the approach for assigning potency upon the introduction or re-qualification of reference 
standards is appropriate.  
The HCP standard used for determination of HCP in the process-specific ELISA method is described. 
The approach for introduction of a new HCP standard is outlined and follows the requirements of Ph. 
Eur. 2.6.34.  
Container closure  
The container closure system for storage of active substance is a pre-sterilised single-use bottle with a 
cap. For the resin, confirmation of compliance with the relevant foodstuff legislation has been provided. 
The closure resin complies with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.5 which is acceptable. The suitability of 
the container closure is supported by the results of real-time, accelerated and stressed stability studies 
(section 3.2.S.7.3) and the extractables study results as discussed in section 3.2.S.2.6. The 
specifications for the container closure are acceptable.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
The proposed shelf-life of the active substance is acceptable.  
There is no trend observed for any active substance quality attribute under any storage condition 
tested.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented in a single-use type I glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper. In 
the initial submission a pre-filled syringe (PFS) was proposed as an additional presentation. The PFS 
presentation has subsequently been withdrawn. 
The finished product is a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly brownish, sterile and 
preservative free aqueous solution.  
Each vial contains 2.3 mg of ranibizumab in 0.23 mL solution. 
Ximluci is intended for intravitreal administration using: 
- A sterile, blunt 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 40 mm) (co-packed); 
- A 1 mL sterile syringe (including a 0.05 mL mark) (provided separately); 
- An injection needle (30G x ½″, 0.3 mm x 13 mm) (provided separately). 
The list of excipients is presented in section 6.1 of the SmPC. No novel excipient is used and they are 
all of Ph. Eur. grade. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The Ximluci finished product formulation was developed to mimic the reference medicinal product 
(RMP) Lucentis. The excipients and formulation are identical for the active substance and the finished 
product. The physico-chemical properties are demonstrated to be clinically relevant for the patient in 
the RMP. There are no materials of animal or human origin.  
The process flow for the finished product manufacturing is clearly outlined and there is a good 
understanding of the risks and CQAs identified at each stage of the process. A summary and 
justification for the proposed CPPs based on the identified CQAs is provided and considered acceptable. 
Active substance thawing studies at both sites determined the thaw time and holding temperature. 
Mixing speeds and times were developed Details on the investigation of the filter compatibility, and the 
filter suppliers is provided. Extractable studies were performed on the systems for sterile filtration and 
levels extracted were considered safe in accordance with ICH Q3C (R8), this is acceptable. 
Engineering batches clinical batches, and additional GMP batches, of Ximluci finished product were 
manufactured. The process was subsequently transferred to the commercial site where engineering 
and process validation batches were manufactured. Process changes in the transfer are site specific 
and clearly described. Process characterisation studies were carried out on batches from the former 
site, and process validation batches from the commercial site. Comparability was based on finished 
product release data, extended characterisation and stability study data. Extended characterisation 
included size distribution, secondary structure, tertiary structure, and thermal stability. The 
characterisation parameters selected for the comparability study are considered acceptable and the 
data provided indicates good comparability between finished product manufactured at both sites.   
The container and closure for the single use vial presentation was selected to mimic the RMP and is 
composed of a type I clear borosilicate glass 2R vial, a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
seal with flip-off cap. The vial and stopper comply with the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs. The 
suitability of the primary packaging components has been confirmed by compatibility studies on the 
vial and the stopper. No volatile, semi-volatile or non-volatile organic compounds were detected above 
the analytical evaluation threshold (AET) level in the extractables study, a leachables study for the 
Assessment report

primary container is not proposed and this is considered acceptable. The finished product comes as a 
vial-only pack or packaged with a CE marked sterile 5 μm filter needle required to withdraw the 
product from the vial. Compatibility studies are provided and considered acceptable.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture  
Sites responsible for the manufacture, control and storage of the finished product operate in 
accordance with EU GMP. STADA Arzneimittel AG, Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, Germany is 
responsible for final EU batch release. 
The manufacturing process for the vial presentation is described and a flow chart detailing CPPs, and 
IPCs at each unit operation is provided.  
The manufacturing process is standard and includes thawing of active substance, compounding with 
formulation buffer followed by sterile filtration through two sterile filters in series and filling into pre-
sterilised vials. There is 100% visual inspection of all filled vials The active substance thaw and hold 
time is considered acceptable. The time out of refrigerator during visual inspection and secondary 
packaging is adequately justified. No reprocessing is proposed. 
Process controls 
The manufacturing process is controlled by CPPs at the buffer preparation, sterile filtration, filling, 
inspection and labelling stages. The process is controlled by IPCs at the buffer preparation, sterile 
filtration and filling stages. The CPPs and IPCs were developed based on a quality target product profile 
(QTPP). A risk management overview and the process impact at each stage in the manufacturing is 
described and considered acceptable. The approach to be followed when CPPs or IPCs fail to meet 
acceptance criteria is acceptable. 
Process validation 
Data are provided for consecutive, commercial scale batches manufactured and filled into vials. Details 
are provided for the active substance batches used to manufacture the finished product. Details of the 
mixing are provided and considered acceptable.  
The transport validation/verification system is considered acceptable. A summary of the outcome of 
the proposed lab-based transport validation study proposed to be provided post authorisation and this 
can be addressed as a recommendation. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications  
Specifications for the finished product include control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and 
other general tests. 
Specifications proposed for the finished product release are identical to the shelf life specifications 
proposed for the stability studies in P.8.1. General tests are included for appearance, visible particles, 
sub-visible particles, pH, osmolality, and container closure integrity. Suitable justification is provided 
for the finished product release specifications. Purity and impurity are determined. Contaminants are 
controlled by endotoxin testing and sterility. Potency and protein concentrations are determined. 
Overall, the testing proposed is generally appropriate and in accordance with the principles of ICH Q6B 
and the Ph. Eur. monograph 2031 ‘monoclonal antibodies for human use’.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 18/125 
 
 
 
The specifications for the finished product are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of the finished product are the same as 
for the active substance, and described in the respective active substance section. Additional methods 
used for DP release testing are the container closure integrity and sub-visible particles testing. Method 
validation is provided for the container/closure integrity testing and considered acceptable. Overall, the 
information provided is considered acceptable.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is provided for finished product batches manufactured. All batch data presented 
met the proposed specifications in place at the time of lot disposition. The batch analysis data 
presented for the process validation batches comply with the limits in the proposed commercial 
finished product specification. Results from these finished product lots show consistency and uniformity 
of the drug product and indicate that the process is under control.  
Container closure 
The container closure consists of a type I clear borosilicate glass 2R vial that is sealed with a rubber 
stopper and capped with an aluminium cap. Adequate descriptions are provided for the components. 
Schematics, specifications and example CoA are provided. The components are manufactured in 
accordance with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs and are acceptable. The extractables study is 
provided and a leachables study is not proposed, and this is considered acceptable. A filter needle can 
be supplied with the vial and details are registered in P.7. A CE certificate for the filter needle has been 
provided. 
Characterisation of impurities 
Analysis for elemental impurities showed no inorganic elements of concern above the respective 30 % 
permitted daily exposure levels according to ICH Q3D. This is acceptable. 
A detailed risk assessment regarding the potential presence of nitrosamines in Ximluci was provided. 
Evaluation was carried out at each stage of the upstream and downstream active substance 
manufacturing and the finished product manufacturing process. Based on the outcome of the 
evaluation, the Applicant concludes that the risk for presence of nitrosamines impurities in the vial 
presentation is negligible and no action is required. This conclusion is considered adequately supported 
based on the information provided and is in accordance with the requirements of EMA/369136/2020 
and EMA/409815/2020 Rev. 7. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A total of three batches of long term data is provided in support of a proposed 36 month shelf life at 
5±3°C for the Ximluci finished product vial presentation. In addition, supporting data is provided for 
engineering batches. The batches on the stability study were manufactured at a representative batch 
size.  
Stability studies are carried out in accordance with current ICH guidelines. Batches were manufactured 
to commercial scale. The container closure used for the stability studies is identical to that used for the 
commercial product. Details on changes to the analytical methods used in the stability studies over the 
course of Ximluci development are outlined. 
Detailed summaries of the results and trending observed for each parameter for each batch on long 
term stability is provided in the dossier. Results for all stability indicating parameters for engineering 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022

batches and process validation batches are within the acceptance criteria tested under long term 
storage conditions. Trending data shows the product is stable with over time. The proposed shelf life is 
further supported with data from accelerated studies and stressed studies.  
The shelf life of 36 months (2 °C – 8 °C) is considered to be adequately supported. Stability data are 
provided for batches for 36 months, and for batches manufactured up to 12 months. Comparability 
between both manufacturing sites has been demonstrated, therefore the shelf life can be leveraged 
from the batches. Nonetheless, it is expected that ongoing studies from the site are completed to 
confirm the shelf life.  
In-use stability data is provided for two clinical batches. Finished product in its primary packaging is 
stable for 48 hours at room temperature (25°C).  
2.2.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
A comprehensive analytical similarity study was performed by the Applicant for the purpose of 
demonstration of biosimilarity at the quality level between the proposed biosimilar product Ximluci, EU 
sourced Lucentis reference product and US sourced Lucentis. The biosimilarity exercise included a side-
by-side comparative analytical assessment (batches of EU Lucentis, batches of US Lucentis and  
batches of Ximluci –) and stability studies to compare degradation profiles.  
The Applicant’s approach for demonstrating biosimilarity is aligned with the relevant CHMP guidelines 
and thus considered acceptable. The selection of batches and assignment of CQAs for the comparative 
assessment is presented in a clear logical manner and is considered acceptable. 
The methods used for biosimilarity assessment are predominantly statistical, and include the following: 
fixed limits (mass spectrometry analysis, amino acid analysis, binding of other members of the VEGF 
family by SPR), quality range approach (QAs with quantitative results), min-max of reference product 
and equivalence testing (as supportive information for QAs with high/very high criticality such as 
binding by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and bioactivity by gene reporter assay). Visual 
assessment was used for chromatographic analysis.  
The vast majority of attributes (strength, bioactivity, binding, and product related species) assessed 
were compared using the defined quality range and comparison of the results of the Ximluci finished 
product batches against the min-max ranges of EU Lucentis and US Lucentis batches. In general, the 
quality attributes analysed were shown to be highly similar between XSB-001 and both EU and US 
Lucentis. A large panel of methods has been used to characterise and compare the most relevant 
physicochemical and biological quality attributes of the ranibizumab molecule.  
The results of the comparative analytical assessment (Table 1) demonstrated that the primary and 
higher order structure, functionally binding and bioactivity to four isoforms of VEGF A of Ximluci 
finished product is highly comparable to EU Lucentis and US Lucentis. For purity and related species, 
some minor differences were observed in Ximluci batches, predominantly in engineering batches 
manufactured using a process which has subsequently been modified slightly to improve purity and are 
not considered to have any meaningful impact. Any differences identified were considered minor and 
were in general sufficiently justified, hence do not impact on the biosimilarity claim.   
The stability testing included accelerated (+25°C ±2°C / 60 % RH ± 5% RH), stressed (+40°C ±2°C / 
75% RH ± 5% RH) and forced degradation studies at low and high pH, oxidative, agitation, freeze-
thaw cycling, normal and UV-light stress conditions. All these studies were conducted with three 
batches each of Ximluci, EU Lucentis and US Lucentis. In general the results show that while some 
minor differences were detected in the rates of degradation/levels of degradants, particularly for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 20/125 
 
 
 
forced degradation studies, overall similar degradation profiles were observed, further supporting 
similarity across Ximluci, EU and US Lucentis.  
Summaries of the methods used in the comparative analytical assessment studies are provided in the 
dossier. Additionally, following a query raised, suitable qualification data was provided for all methods. 
In summary, the data presented support similarity between Ximluci and both EU and US Lucentis. 
Biosimilarity is considered demonstrated.

2.2.3.6.  Post-approval change management protocol(s) 
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) is proposed for the scale-up of active 
substance manufacture by a factor of 10.  
Three consecutive validation batches are planned to support the scale-up. All of the final CPPs/PPs will 
be verified and reported for the process validation batches. In addition, the FMEA performed to verify 
that no change to manufacturing process controls is required was provided and supports the proposed 
approach. The proposal to verify the proposed in-process hold times and temperatures as part of the 
process validation is acceptable. Active substance batches will be included in a long-term and 
accelerated conditions stability program. An updated risk assessment for extractables and leachables 
will be performed which is agreed.  
Comparability of the current and proposed process will be evaluated by in-process data and release 
testing of active substance from the validation batches. The testing panel for comparability includes 
release tests and additional extended characterisation tests. Results from historical  process batches 
will be included in the comparability exercise and used to generate comparability acceptance criteria. 
The testing panel and acceptance criteria for the comparability exercise have been registered to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 30/125 
 
 
 
PACMP and are acceptable. Historical process batches will be statistically evaluated for quantitative 
quality attributes and the acceptance criteria will be based on mean ±3SD for all CQAs except when 
this is not feasible for the method. In the latter case, the Min-Max range will be used.  
The PACMP proposed for the scale-up of the active substance manufacturing process is considered 
acceptable. 
Following the withdrawal of the PFS presentation during the procedure, the Applicant proposed a 
PACMP for the future registration of the PFS presentation. However, numerous deficiencies were noted 
in the PACMP. While some aspects could be addressed by significant revision of the PACMP, there were 
numerous issues that did not appear to be resolvable. As a consequence, the Applicant decided to 
remove the PACMP for the PFS from the dossier.  
2.2.3.7.  Adventitious agents 
The active substance is produced by bacterial fermentation, which does not support the growth of 
viruses.  
No materials or excipients of biological origin are used in the active substance and finished product 
manufacturing processes.  
The cell banks have been screened for microbiological purity and absence of bacteriophage has been 
confirmed.  
TSE certificates have been provided for the active substance, finished product and for the components 
of the active substance/finished product formulation and are acceptable.  
The control strategy for microbial purity and endotoxins is described and is acceptable. Animal-derived 
materials were used in the product of the butyl rubber stopper. Statements are provided confirming 
that these materials are in compliance with EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3.  
It is agreed that the risk of viral contamination is negligible. The risk of TSE transmission is also 
negligible.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance manufacturing process is standard, adequately described and appropriately 
validated. The active substance has been appropriately characterised with respect to primary, 
secondary and higher order structure, binding properties and bioactivity, size distribution, charge 
distribution and hydrophobic/hydrophilic species. The active substance specifications and proposed 
analytical methods are acceptable. The proposed active substance shelf-life is acceptable.  
A PACMP is proposed for the scale-up of active substance manufacture by a factor of 10. The PACMP is 
acceptable.  
The active substance is produced by bacterial fermentation. No materials or excipients of biological 
origin are used in the active substance and finished product manufacturing processes. Statements are 
provided confirming that animal-derived materials used in the manufacture of finished product primary 
packaging are in compliance with EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3. It is agreed that the risk of viral contamination 
or TSE transmission is negligible.  
The Ximluci finished product is presented as a single-use vial. In the initial submission a PFS was 
proposed as an additional presentation. The PFS presentation was subsequently withdrawn. The 
Applicant proposed a PACMP to introduce the PFS presentation and this has also been withdrawn.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 31/125 
 
 
 
Information on the finished product formulation is provided and acceptable. Overall, the 
pharmaceutical development of the vial presentation is acceptable. Engineering batches, clinical 
batches, and additional GMP batches of Ximluci finished product were manufactured. The process was 
subsequently transferred to the commercial site where process validation was performed. Process 
changes in the transfer are site specific and clearly described. Comparability studies are well described 
and indicate good comparability of the finished product from both sites. The container and closure was 
selected to mimic the RMP single use vial presentation and is composed of a type I clear borosilicate 
glass 2R vial, a rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with flip-off cap. The vial and stopper comply 
with the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs.  
The finished product manufacturing process is described and a flow chart detailing CPPs, and IPCs at 
each unit operation is provided. The manufacturing process is standard and includes thawing of active 
substance, compounding with formulation buffer followed by sterile filtration through two sterile filters 
in series and filling into pre-sterilised vials. The manufacturing process is adequately controlled and the 
approach to be followed when CPPs or IPCs fail to meet acceptance criteria is described. Data are 
provided for three consecutive, commercial scale batches manufactured at the site and filled into vials.  
Specifications are proposed for the finished product release and are identical to the shelf life 
specifications proposed for the stability studies in P.8.1. The specifications are acceptable and in 
accordance with the Ph. Eur. 2031. A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities 
in Ximluci is provided and considered acceptable.  
Batch analysis data is provided for finished product batches. All batch data presented met the 
proposed specifications in place at the time of lot disposition.  
The container closure consists of a type I clear borosilicate glass 2R vial that is sealed with a 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and capped with an aluminium cap. Adequate descriptions are provided for 
the components. Schematics, specifications and example certificates of analysis are provided. The 
components are manufactured in accordance with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs and are 
acceptable.  
The finished product shelf life of 36 months is considered to be adequately supported. The finished 
product in its primary packaging is stable for 48 hours at ambient conditions. 
The Applicant’s approach for demonstrating biosimilarity is aligned with the relevant CHMP guidelines 
and  thus  considered  acceptable.  The  selection  of  batches  and  assignment  of  criticality  of  quality 
attributes for the comparative assessment is presented in a clear logical manner. In general, the quality 
attributes analysed were shown to be highly similar between Ximluci and both EU and US Lucentis. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  overall  quality  of  Ximluci  is  considered  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation 
comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Ximluci is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Ximluci (XSB-001/ranibizumab) is a recombinantly produced Fab fragment of the humanized 
monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb) that binds and neutralizes VEGF-A. It has been developed as a 
biosimilar to the reference product Lucentis (ranibizumab; Novartis Eurpharm Limited) authorised in 
the EU. 
In order to demonstrate similarity to the reference product, the applicant has performed several in 
vitro studies. Binding of Ximluci, EU Lucentis and US Lucentis to VEGF-A was assessed by surface 
plasmon resonance measurements. Comparability assessment of bioactivity was by means of a 
reporter gene assay involving KDR/NFAT-RE HEK293 cells. The suitability of the reporter gene assay 
was verified by using a HUVEC proliferation assay. Four different isoforms of VEGF-A were included in 
the studies and most weight was given to the results for the predominant isoform 165. In general, 
binding and bioactivity of Ximluci were within the defined comparative assessment ranges for the 
reference products, suggesting similarity.  
The assessment of biosimilarity of Ximluci and Lucentis will be primarily based on the quality 
assessment of the appropriateness and acceptability of the in vitro comparability studies conducted. 
The submitted nonclinical pharmacology studies do not suggest a significant difference between 
Ximluci and the reference products tested. 
Ximluci and Lucentis did not bind to other members of the VEGF family (VEGF-B, VEF-C, VEGF-D, and 
PIGF-1). 
No safety pharmacology or PD drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. This is considered 
acceptable for a biosimilar application. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A GLP-compliant study (study 5701026) was conducted in male NZW rabbits to compare the 
pharmacokinetics of Ximluci to the reference product, Lucentis. Each test item was administered as a 
single bilateral IVT injection to eight male NZW rabbits at a dose of 0.5 mg/eye (50 μL/eye). For 
pharmacokinetic analysis, serum concentrations of Lucentis and Ximluci were determined. In addition, 
concentrations of the drugs were measured in ocular tissues.  
Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of Ximluci and Lucentis in NZW rabbit serum, vitreous humor 
and sensory retina showed that concentration profiles and PK parameters were similar between Ximluci 
and Lucentis. The highest Ximluci/ranibizumab exposure in both groups was found locally in the eye, 
with comparable systemic exposures in serum. The results support the biosimilarity of Ximluci to RMP 
Lucentis. 
No metabolism, excretion or PK interaction studies were conducted as part of this application, in line 
with biosimilar development guidelines (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
A GLP-compliant, comparative single dose study in male NZW rabbits (Study 5701026) was performed 
to compare the toxicity profiles of Ximluci and Lucentis. A full toxicological assessment was not 
performed, but clinical signs, body weights, and appetence were monitored and histopathology of 
ocular tissues, ophthalmologic examinations and electroretinograms (ERGs) were performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 33/125 
 
 
 
Overall, the study indicated that a single bilateral intravitreal injection of Ximluci or Lucentis was well 
tolerated with no abnormal clinical signs or changes in body weights, appetite, or ERG parameters. 
Ophthalmic observations in the group that received Lucentis included transient uveitis or interior 
chamber inflammation in two animals. Minor conjunctival hyperemia was noted in animals from both 
Ximluci and Lucentis groups on Day 2, and was attributed to the IVT procedure. No ophthalmic 
observations related to Ximluci were observed. Mononuclear cell infiltration to ocular tissues occurred 
in both test item and reference groups, with an increased incidence and severity in the eyes 
administered Lucentis compared to the eyes administered Ximluci. The results support the similarity of 
Ximluci to Lucentis. In addition, Ximluci is formulated using the same excipients as Lucentis and 
therefore, no additional unanticipated toxicity is expected. 
The comparative quality and nonclinical in vitro assessment of Ximluci did not identify any significant 
concerns in relation to biosimilarity to the reference product and, as the in vitro assays may be more 
specific and sensitive than studies in animals, the results of this in vivo study were not considered 
necessary from a nonclinical perspective to support the MAA.  
No genotoxicity, reproductive toxicology or carcinogenicity studies have been performed and, as 
outlined in the relevant guidance, these are not necessary for biosimilars 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).  
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided a justification for not submitting ERA studies on the basis that ranibizumab 
(XSB-001) is a protein, which is in line with the EMA guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, Ximluci is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package to support the MAA includes in vitro assays (receptor-binding studies and cell-
based bioassays and) as well as an in vivo comparative, single-dose study evaluating PK and toxicity 
profiles of Ximluci and Lucentis in NZW rabbits. Data are considered in the context of the 
demonstration of biosimilarity to Lucentis, and of the applicable guidelines. 
Pharmacology 
The nonclinical pharmacology assessment comprised of (1) a quantitative comparison of Ximluci DP 
and Lucentis in vitro binding to different VEGF-A isoforms using an SPR/Biacore assay, (2) functional 
comparisons between Ximluci and Lucentis capacities to inhibit VEGF-signalling using the VEGFR2 
HEK293-cell reporter gene assay (HEK293/RGA) and (3) measurement of the proliferative response of 
Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) to VEGF-A by Ximluci and Lucentis. The results of 
the in vitro studies are sufficient from a non-clinical point of view to demonstrate similarity between 
Ximluci and the reference product, Lucentis. The absence of secondary PD, safety pharmacology or PD 
drug interactions is in line with relevant guidance. 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK profiles of Ximluci and Lucentis were assessed following a single bilateral intravitreal injection in 
NZW rabbits. Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics in serum, vitreous humour and sensory retina 
showed that concentration profiles and PK parameters were similar between Ximluci and Lucentis. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 34/125 
 
 
 
study was not deemed necessary to support the MAA. The absence of metabolism, excretion or PK 
interaction studies is acceptable in accordance with relevant guidance. 
Toxicology 
A GLP-compliant, single-dose non-clinical in vivo toxicology study of limited scope was completed to 
support regulatory approval outside the EU. The study indicated that Ximluci is similar to the reference 
product Lucentis with respect to tolerability following a single bilateral IVT injection of NZW rabbits. In 
accordance with relevant guidance and CHMP scientific advice provided to the applicant, the results of 
this study were not considered necessary from a nonclinical perspective to support the MAA. The 
proposed texts for sections 4.6 and 5.3 are in line with that of the reference product. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data support biosimilarity of Ximluci vs the reference product Lucentis and the MAA is 
considered approvable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Bioanalytical methods 
Bioanalytical report PK  
The Applicant employed an ECL immunoassay for the detection and quantitation of Xlucane 
(ranibizumab) in Human plasma. While 209 samples were collected, due to errors which have been 
sufficiently documented results from only 205 samples are reported. A short description of the run 
procedure and the run acceptance criteria has been provided, this is considered appropriate. No 
deviations for the standard operating procedure (SOP) were reported. Overall, the data provided is in 
line with the EU guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1). 
Analytical Method Validation PK  
The Applicant has provided a validation report outlining the processes employed for the validation of 
the assay for the quantitation of Xlucane and of the originator Lucentis in human plasma. The assay 
used for the quantitation of Ranibizumab was electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay. The 
steps of the ECL immunoassay have been well described and the method is considered adequate for 
the quantification of Ranibizumab. The run acceptance criteria have been defined for precision and 
accuracy, specificity, selectivity, dilution linearity and stability and validation data have been provided 
for each.  
Bioanalytical Report ADA and NAb  
The Applicant has provided data for the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising 
antibodies (NAb) to ranibizumab in human serum. For the ADA assay, a bridging format was used to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 36/125 
 
 
 
 
 
determine if anti-ranibizumab antibodies were present in the sample, if samples were found positive in 
the screening step then a confirmatory assay re-assessed these positive samples through the addition 
of unlabelled ranibizumab to determine if the assay signal was inhibited. If the samples were deemed 
positive, a titration assay semi-quantified the antibody response by determining a titre for signal 
inhibition. All samples confirmed positive in the ADA confirmatory assay were analysed for the 
presence of NAbs. It is noted that there were a small number of SOP deviations, however, they were 
all justified by the Applicant and deemed acceptable. 
Analytical Method Validation ADA 
In the validation report for the ADA assay, the positive control is an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal 
IgG antibody against Ximluci spiked into the negative control pool; the negative control is human 
serum from healthy non-elderly individuals. A screening cut point has been established using a floating 
cut point approach. The screening cut point data was generated using 50 lots of healthy human serum. 
The confirmatory cut point has been established using 50 samples with a 1% false positive rate. A 
confirmatory cut point of 16.255% was determined where above this value the samples are deemed 
positive for ADAs and below they are considered negative for ADAs.  
Analytical Method Validation Nab 
The Applicant is using an electrochemiluminescence method whereby samples and controls are first 
incubated with biotinylated Ximluci. The anti-ranibizumab neutralizing antibodies bound to biotinylated 
Ximluci are captured on a streptavidin-coated ELISA plate. The antibodies are eluted and incubated 
with ruthenylated Ximluci in a streptavidin plated coated with biotinylated VEGF. The signal generated 
from reading this plate has an inverse relationship with the level of anti-ranibizumab neutralizing 
antibodies. A cut point factor for the neutralising assay was determined using 50 lots of human serum.  
Biosimilarity 
Study XBR1001 was a Phase III double-blind parallel, group, multicentre study which compared the 
efficacy and safety of Ximluci (Xlucane) versus EU-licensed Lucentis® in patients with wAMD (aged 
≥50 years). Subjects received either Ximluci  (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) or Lucentis (0.05 
mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) in the study eye once every 4 weeks/monthly. The assigned study drug 
was administered by IVT injection. 
While the main efficacy and safety results are discussed in sections below, two of the secondary 
objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the systemic exposure of Ximluci vs Lucentis in subjects participating in 
pharmacokinetic evaluation; 
To evaluate immunogenicity (i.e. anti-ranibizumab antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing ADAs) of 
Ximluci vs Lucentis. 
. The results  for the PK and immunogenicity objectives are outlined below. 
Pharmacokinetics  
40 subjects in the Ximluci group and 30 subjects in the Lucentis group were included in the PK sub-
study. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics for the PKS were similar between the 
Ximluci group and the Lucentis group. 
Descriptive statistics for PK plasma ranibizumab concentrations for the PKS are presented in Table 3. 
The plasma ranibizumab concentrations were similar between the Ximluci and Lucentis groups at Day 1 
and Week 20.

To account for potential differences in ranibizumab protein concentration between Ximluci and Lucentis 
batches, plasma ranibizumab concentrations were normalised for protein concentration. The plasma 
ranibizumab concentrations normalised for protein concentration were similar between the Ximluci and 
Lucentis groups at Day 1 and Week 20. 
Immunogenicity 
292 subjects in the Ximluci group and 289 subjects in the Lucentis group were included in the 
evaluation of immunogenicity. At baseline, the incidence of positive ADA was 12 subjects (4.2%) in the 
Ximluci group and 8 subjects (2.9%) in the Lucentis group. At Week 24, the cumulative incidence of 
positive ADA was low in both treatment groups: 22 subjects (7.5%) in the Ximluci group and 17 
subjects (5.9%) in the Lucentis group. At Week 52, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was 33 
subjects (11.3%) in the Ximluci group and 38 subjects (13.1%) in the Lucentis group. There were no 
notable differences in immunogenicity results between the Ximluci and Lucentis groups over time and 
the incidence of positive ADA was similar between treatment groups at all assessed time points.

The Applicant is employing an ECL immunoassay for the detection and quantitation of Ximluci 
(ranibizumab) in Human plasma. To do this, 209 samples were collected, however, due to errors which 
have been sufficiently documented only 205 results are reported.  
The calibration standards and QC samples (low mid and high) acceptance criteria have been provided 
and are in line with the EU guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1). A short description of 
the run procedure and the run acceptance criteria has been provided. This is deemed appropriate for 
the assay report. No deviations for the standard operating procedure (SOP) were reported. 
The Applicant has confirmed as part of the D120 responses that the samples were stored at -20°C for 
a maximum of 201 days before transfer to the lab and subsequent storage at -80°C. Updated data has 
been provided demonstrating that the storage of Ximluci and Lucentis for 9 months (270 days) does 
not impact quantification of Ximluci. Long-term stability studies are ongoing for plasma stored at -80°C 
and are anticipated to be completed by H1 2023. The median storage time for samples during this 
study is 307 days, while one sample has been stored for 691 day. The issue is considered resolved. 
Analytical Method Validation PK  
The Applicant has provided a validation report outlining the processes employed for the validation of 
the assay for the quantitation of Ranibizumab biosimilar (Ximluci) and originator (Lucentis®) in human 
plasma. The assay used for the quantitation of Ranibizumab was electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
immunoassay. The steps of the ECL immunoassay have been well described and the method is 
considered adequate for the quantification of Ranibizumab. A summary of the validation steps has 
been provided which defines the testing performed and the results obtained. 
The run acceptance criteria has been defined for precision and accuracy, specificity, selectivity, dilution 
linearity and stability. Validation has been performed on the calibration standards and QC samples in 
accordance with the EU guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1) with the appropriate 
acceptance standards set and data provided demonstrating they meet these acceptance criteria.  
The method has been for the most part validated according to EU guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1), however, a few queries were raised. It is noted that while 
parallelism acceptance criteria have been set, however, no validation has been performed. It has been 
stated that due to the lack of highly concentrated clinical samples and the fact that the clinical samples 
were successfully analysed undiluted, that parallelism is evaluated adequately by selectivity and 
dilutional linearity which is considered appropriate. Cross validation data has now been provided for a 
concentration range (200 – 120,000 pg/mL) that shows there is no bias towards either Ximluci or 
Lucentis as the relative bias (%RE) at nominal concentrations for each data point is less than 15%. It 
has been confirmed that no specificity testing was done as there was no administration of any co-
medication. In addition, the patients enrolled in the study were not allowed receive treatments that 
might interfere with the assessment of study endpoints. 
Bioanalytical Report ADA and NAb  
The Applicant has provided data for the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising 
antibodies (NAb) to ranibizumab in human serum. The method has been well described and the results 
for each patient have been supplied. For the ADA assay, a bridging format was used to determine if 
anti-ranibizumab antibodies were present in the sample, if samples were found positive in the 
screening step then a confirmatory assay re-assessed these positive samples through the addition of 
unlabelled ranibizumab to determine if the assay signal was inhibited. If the samples were deemed 
positive, a titration assay semi-quantified the antibody response by determining a titre for signal 
inhibition. All samples confirmed positive in the ADA confirmatory assay were analysed for the 
presence of NAbs. Overall, the data provided in the report for the ADA and NAb testing is deemed 
sufficient.

Analytical Method Validation ADA 
The Applicant is using a bridging format to determine the presence of anti-ranibizumab antibodies. 
Data has now been provided to support a minimum required dilution of 1:10. 
A screening cut point has been established using a floating cut point approach. In this approach a 
plate-specific floating cut point approach is being used, this is endorsed. The screening cut point data 
was generated using 50 lots of healthy human serum as control sera from wAMD patients were not 
commercially available. Data has been provided which showed that based on the screening factor set 
from the healthy patients, a FPR of 6.51% for the clinical patients was determined which is close to the 
ideal value of 5%. The confirmatory cut point has been established using 50 samples with a 1% false 
positive rate allowed. 
Assay precision was performed to determine inter- and intra-assay precision using the positive 
controls. Inter-assay precision was determined using 5 batches (n=3) and 1 batch (n=6) by 2 analysts 
on 3 different days using the screening and confirmatory format. 
Matrix selectively was performed on non-elderly serum and elderly serum with spiked positive control 
material. For the non-elderly samples, three PCL-2 samples were below the confirmatory acceptance 
criteria. The Applicant argues that although two elderly rum samples at the 1.20 ng/mL positive control 
(PCL-1) showed a % Inhibition ≤ CCP, the acceptance criteria set by the Applicant is more strict than 
the criteria in the EMA’s Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 
Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). In addition, following respiking studies using elderly patient serum the results met 
the companies 90% acceptance criteria for selectivity in elderly serum. It is agreed that the ADA assay 
meets the method validation acceptance criteria and there is no risk for false negatives. 
Further matrix effects by hemolysis and lipemia on detection of anti-Ximluci antibodies in human 
serum samples were investigated. For both the hemolysed and lipemic serum, several results did not 
meet the acceptance criteria and therefore the experiment was repeated with the initial 5 serum lots 
and an additional 5 lots. In the repeated experiment, all results passed for PCH and PCL-1 for the 
hemolysed samples. For the lipemic samples, 1/10 results failed the confirmatory assay for PCL-1. The 
Applicant argues that this is just below the target value of 90%. In a post hoc analysis, the Applicant 
identified patients with triglyceride levels exceeding 3.4 mmol/L as these are considered lipemic. The 
lipemic sample set confirmed 36.4% ADA-positive samples which was smaller than the overall sample 
set which had 45.9% ADA-positive samples, however, it is agreed that due to the small sample size it 
is not possible to conclude if there is a bias for lipemic samples and it can be agreed that it is unlikely 
there is false-negative results from the analysis of potentially lipemic samples in the ADA confirmatory 
assay. 
No prozone effect was determined using one sample of ultra-high concentration PC stock (107000 
ng/mL) prepared in human serum which was diluted 3-fold. Additional data has been provided with the 
D120 responses that shows the prozone effect was investigated during method development by 
preparing anti-Ximluci PC and anti-Lucentis PC at a concentration of 26,750 ng/mL and performing 
serial dilutions 2-fold. The samples were performed in triplicate and the result for each ruled out a 
prozone effect. 
The Applicant argues that the tolerance curves for Ximluci and Lucentis are visually comparable, 
thereby demonstrating antigenic equivalence and justifying the appropriateness of using a single assay 
approach. Given the difficulty in drawing a definitive conclusion from this data, the Applicant should 
provide additional data to justify antigenic equivalence. The Applicant has provided expanded data 
analysis which studied the antigenic equivalency of Ximluci and Lucentis at concentrations up to 8 
µg/mL at two positive control concentrations PC-(H) high and PC-(M) medium. The difference in signal 
in the presence of Ximluci and Lucentis was shown to be within the validated precision of the assay 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 41/125 
 
 
 
(%CV<20%), therefore, it is agreed the method is suitable in detecting ADA towards Ximluci or 
Lucentis.  
No robustness testing has been performed, the Applicant argues that they have demonstrated 
robustness through the study of accuracy, precision, selectivity, target interference, prozone effect, 
drug tolerance, one-assay approach short-term stability, and bench stability. It is agreed that the 
Applicant has shown the method is robust to changes in conditions.  
Analytical Method Validation Nab 
The Applicant is using an electrochemiluminescence method whereby samples and controls are first 
incubated with biotinylated Ximluci. The anti-ranibizumab neutralizing antibodies bound to biotinylated 
Ximluci are captured on a streptavidin-coated ELISA plate. The antibodies are eluted and incubated 
with ruthenylated Ximluci in a streptavidin plated coated with biotinylated VEGF. The signal generated 
from reading this plate has an inverse relationship with the level of anti-ranibizumab neutralizing 
antibodies. It is noted that the minimum required dilution is stated to be 1:2.5, however, no data to 
support this has been provided, as part of the D120 responses they have shown that at a dilution of 
2.5 the method performs adequately in determining the neutralising antibodies using various different 
reagent concentrations and conditions. In addition, the dilution of 2.5 is considered very low and is at 
the range that would be expected for this kind of assay. The applicant has confirmed that the CoA for 
the positive control “Affinity Purified Rabbit Polyclonal IgG antibodies against ranibizumab” is attached 
in Appendix C of the NAb validation report, however, it is under the name “Affinity Purified Antibody”. 
A cut point factor for the neutralising assay was determined using 50 lots of human serum from 
healthy subjects over 4 days by 2 analysts. A justification has been provided to state healthy serum 
was chosen as wAMD patients were not commercially available. A floating cut point was used for the 
assay, this is endorsed. Specificity testing data was provided to show the assays ability to detect 
neutralising antibodies in the presence healthy human serum and elderly human serum. In addition, 
the Applicant showed that increasing amounts of Ximluci or Lucentis in the presence of the PC could 
inhibit the assay signal, demonstrating the response is specific for NAb towards the drug product. 
Assay precision was performed to determine inter- and intra-assay precision using the positive 
controls. All the samples met the acceptance criteria for the inter- and intra-assay precision. 
Drug tolerance studies determined that the NAb assay is tolerant of up to 5.00 ng/mL Ximluci at the 
PCL (245 ng/mL) level and up to 10.0 ng/mL of Ximluci at the PCM (600 ng/mL) and PCH (4000 
ng/mL) antibody levels. The assay is tolerant of up to 10.0 ng/mL of Lucentis at the PCL (245 ng/mL), 
PCM (600 ng/mL) and PCH (4000 ng/mL) antibody levels. The Applicant states the potential of free 
drug interference with immunogenicity testing was factored into the design of the sampling strategy of 
study XBR1001. For the PK study, samples were collected 23h (+/- 60 minutes) after initial dosing and 
23h (+/- 60 minutes) after the sixth dose (week 20) which ensures the PK measurements are near the 
Cmax, however, for the immunogenicity testing sampling was done immediately before initiation of the 
next treatment cycle which ensures the least drug interference with ADA detection. 
No robustness testing has been performed, however, it is agreed that robustness shown as the method 
was developed and validated at a central bioanalysis laboratory and the following parameters were 
validated; cut point factor determination, sensitivity, precision, matrix selectivity, drug tolerance, 
stability, prozone effect, short-term stability, control response ranges, and bench stability. In addition, 
no long-term stability data has been provided, however, it is agreed that the Applicant does not need 
to provide long-term stability data for the ADA/NAb as previous scientific studies have shown that 
neutralising antibodies are stable for several years. 
Biosimilarity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 42/125 
 
 
 
The Phase 3 study (XBR1001, Xplore) comparing Ximluci to EU-Lucentis in patients with wAMD 
included a PK sub-study for assessment of similarity in systemic exposure between Ximluci vs. EU-
Lucentis. The design and methodology of this sub-study are considered acceptable. The systemic 
exposure and immunogenicity of ranibizumab appear similar between the Ximluci and Lucentis groups 
in this study, which provides support for clinical similarity between Ximluci vs Lucentis.  
No other clinical PK studies or analyses, including plasma protein binding, hepatic metabolism, special 
populations, drug-drug interactions and other intrinsic and extrinsic PK factors, were performed and no 
specific clinical pharmacodynamic studies were performed. This is acceptable for this biosimilar 
application since it relies on the information already known of the reference product. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Only one clinical study was conducted to support approval of the biosimilar product Ximluci, which 
included a PK sub-study. This is considered sufficient for the present application. There were no major 
objections raised for clinical pharmacology. Some other concerns were raised and all of these have 
been sufficiently resolved. 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant has submitted one randomised double-blind study comparing the ranibizumab biosimilar 
(Ximluci) with the authorised reference product Lucentis in patients with wet age-related macular 
degeneration.  
The study was carried out at a number of centres in the EU as well as in the USA, India, Israel, Russia, 
and Ukraine. The study is 52 weeks in duration. . 
A number of scientific advices’ were provided by the CHMP in relation to the study design. In the main, 
the Applicant followed the scientific advice. 
2.4.5.1.  Main study 
Xplore: A Phase III Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Multicenter Study to 
Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Xlucane* versus Lucentis® in Patients 
with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (XBR1001) 
*Xlucane was an earlier name for Ximluci 
Methods 
This was a 52 week randomised double-blind controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of 
Ximluci (Xlucane) to Lucentis in patients with neovascular also known as wet age related macular 
degeneration. When all subjects completed their 6-month assessments, an analysis of efficacy and 
safety endpoints, as well as PK and immunogenicity, was performed. The analysis did not affect further 
conduct of the study. The subjects, masked investigators, and study personnel remained masked to 
the treatment group assignment throughout the study period after randomisation. The analysis was 
reported in an Interim Analysis CSR (dated 13 August 2021). The Interim Analysis CSR (Through Week 
24), dated 13 August 2021, presented study results for all subjects through the Week 24 visit and 
included data up to the interim analysis data snapshot of 10 June 2021 for all subjects in the study.

Treatments 
Ximluci 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) was administered by ophthalmic IVT injection 
(only) once every 4 weeks (approximately 28 days/monthly) in the study eye for 12 months in 
subjects with wAMD who were randomised to receive Ximluci. 
Lucentis 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) was also administered by ophthalmic IVT 
injection (only) once every 4 weeks (approximately 28 days/monthly) in the study eye for 12 months 
in subjects with wAMD who were randomised to receive Lucentis. 
Objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022

The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that the biosimilar candidate Ximluci is 
equivalent to Lucentis in subjects with wAMD as assessed by the change in best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) from Baseline to Week 8. 
Relevant secondary objectives of the study were as follows: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of Ximluci versus Lucentis in subjects with wAMD based on 
central foveal thickness (CFT) measured by spectral domain optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), area of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), and presence of leakage 
assessed by fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) 
• To evaluate the safety of Ximluci versus Lucentis 
• To evaluate the systemic exposure of Ximluci versus Lucentis in subjects participating in 
PK evaluation 
• To evaluate immunogenicity (ie, anti-ranibizumab antibodies and neutralising anti-
ranibizumab antibodies) of Ximluci versus Lucentis 
The study is an equivalence study. To test for equivalence between the 2 treatments, a two 1-sided 
testing procedure was used to test each of the following hypotheses using 1-sided tests at the 5% 
(United States) and 2.5% ROW significance levels: 
a)  H0,A: μXimluci - μLucentis ≤ -3.5 versus H1,A: μXimluci - μLucentis > -3.5 
b)  H0,B: μXimluci - μLucentis ≥ 3.5 versus H0,B: μXimluci - μLucentis < 3.5 
with μ = mean change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline using the ETDRS protocol for 
the identified treatment group. 
Biosimilarity was to be concluded if the 2-sided 90% (US FDA) or 95% (Rest of the World) confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference in mean change in BCVA at Week 8 between Ximluci and Lucentis was 
confined within the equivalence margin of ±3.5 letters. A meta-analysis of ANCHOR and MARINA 
studies was done in order to focus on Week 8 BCVA data and ensure that the proposed equivalence 
margin would preserve at least 50% of the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in mean change 
in BCVA between treatment and placebo which was 7.7 letters. Considering this and that the minimal 
clinically important difference in visual acuity had previously been set to or estimated to be 5 to 10 
letters, an equivalence margin of ±3.5 letters was deemed adequate and supported by EMA/FDA in 
recent scientific advice. 
Due to the increase in protocol deviations (PDs) related to the COVID-19 pandemic and following the 
recent ICH E9 (R1) Addendum, an estimand framework was provided in the protocol to provide a more 
comprehensive approach to show the impact of COVID-19 in the analysis. For the primary estimand, 
the scientific question of interest was the between-group difference (Ximluci versus Lucentis) in the 
mean change from Baseline in BCVA letter score at Week 8 in subjects who fulfilled the study eligibility 
criteria, had no IEs up to and including the Week 8 BCVA assessment, and completed 8 weeks of 
treatment of study drug (given as a single ophthalmic IVT injection every 4 weeks/monthly). 
IEs were defined as:

data (missing or collected) were imputed in the analysis with a hypothetical strategy. 
The secondary estimand of the study for the primary endpoint was meant to use a strategy to address 
the IEs compared to the primary estimand: a treatment policy implemented by using any data 
collected following the IE in the analysis. So the scientific question of interest was the between-group 
difference (Ximluci versus Lucentis) in the mean change from baseline in BCVA letter score at Week 8 
in subjects who fulfilled the study eligibility criteria and completed 8 weeks of treatment of study drug, 
regardless of any other IEs. However, because the study design did not plan for assessments following 
early treatment discontinuation, it was not possible to apply a true treatment policy strategy. As such, 
any missing data following early treatment discontinuation was imputed in line with a hypothetical 
strategy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was the change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline 
using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol for the study eye. 
The secondary endpoints of the study were as follows: 
• Change in BCVA letters at Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, Week 36, and Week 52 
compared to Baseline using the ETDRS protocol for the study eye 
• Change in total size of choroidal neovascular leakage area in the study eye measured by 
FA at Week 24 and Week 52 compared to Baseline 
• Change in total size of CNV in the study eye measured by FA at Week 24 and Week 52 
compared to Baseline 
• Change in CFT in the study eye measured by OCT at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, 
Week 24, Week 36, and Week 52 compared to Baseline  
•  Changes in the size and/or number of intraretinal cystoid space (cysts), subretinal 
fluid, and retinal pigment epithelium detachments in the study eye measured by 
qualitative morphology-based OCT compared to Baseline 
• Percentage of subjects with loss of <15 letters using ETDRS, evaluated as change at 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, and Week 52 compared to Baseline in the study eye 
• Percentage of subjects with gain of ≥15 letters using ETDRS, evaluated as change at 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, and Week 52 compared to Baseline in the study eye 
• Percentage of subjects without intra- or subretinal fluid in the study eye (ie, completely 
dry) at Week 24 and Week 52 
• Percentage of subjects with retinal pigment epithelium detachments in the study eye 
Sample size 
The change in BCVA after 8 weeks was evaluated from previous studies based on similar patient 
populations. There was a wide range of SD across the studies, ranging from 8.58 letters to 11.83 
letters. 
For the purpose of sample size calculation, an SD of 10 letters was assumed for this study. This was 
based on an analysis of the data from clinical trials of the originator product demonstrating a clear 
correlation between Baseline BCVA and the SD of the change of BCVA at Week 8. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 48/125 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering that a narrower inclusion criterion for BCVA was being applied in this study compared to 
the studies of the originator product, it was expected that a Baseline BCVA of around 60 letters would 
be observed. Therefore, an SD of 10 for the primary endpoint was well in the upper range of what was 
expected. 
From 580 randomised subjects, there would be >90% power to show equivalence (ie, 2-sided 95% CI 
for the mean difference between Ximluci and Lucentis would be confined within the equivalence margin 
of ±3.5 letters) if the SD was no more than 10.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Upon confirmation of eligibility for a given subject to participate in the study, a unique randomisation 
number for that subject was assigned via an IWRS. The IWRS was accessed immediately by study site 
personnel after confirmation of the subject’s eligibility had been recorded. The randomisation number 
for a given subject was used to identify the study drug that was administered to that subject. 
The randomisation scheme automatically ensured that the study drug assignment for a given subject 
was random and that an overall 1:1 ratio of assignments to each of the 2 study drug treatments was 
approximated. 
Randomisation was stratified according to the following: eye colour (light iris versus dark iris), 
geographical region where enrolled, and the BCVA letters at Baseline (55 or lower, 56 to 65, 66 or 
higher). Permuted random blocks within each stratification combination was used to ensure the 1:1 
ratio within each combination. 
An independent biostatistician created the randomisation scheme, which remained unavailable to all 
other masked individuals, until after study completion and subsequent locking of the study database. 
Once a randomisation number had been assigned, that number must not have been used again for any 
other subject.  
The study was double masked. The identity of the study treatment assignments were not known to 
subjects.Those involved in the preparation or administration of the study treatments were not involved 
in the assessment of efficacy. Randomisation information for any particular subject was made available 
to the investigator only in the event of a medical emergency or an AE that necessitated identification of 
the study drug for the welfare of that participant. 
When all subjects completed their 6-month assessments, an unmasked analysis of efficacy (i.e. 
equivalence) and safety endpoints, as well as PK and immunogenicity, was performed. The aim of the 
unmasked analysis was to initiate the submission of the application for marketing authorisation as 
agreed with the EMA. The analysis was reported in an Interim Analysis CSR (dated 13 August 2021). 
The Interim Analysis CSR (Through Week 24), dated 13 August 2021, presented study results for all 
subjects through the Week 24 visit and included data up to the interim analysis data snapshot of 10 
June 2021 for all subjects in the study. The Final CSR (Through Week 52) included all data collected in 
the study up to the Week 52 End of Treatment Visit (11 November 2021). 
Statistical methods 
The change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline using the ETDRS protocol in the study eye 
was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) on evaluable data for the primary 
analysis of the primary estimand of the study.  
An MMRM was implemented in SAS PROC MIXED using a restricted maximum likelihood approach. An 
unstructured covariance structure shared across treatment groups was used to model the within-

Page 49/125 
 
 
 
 
subject errors (UN option in PROC MIXED). If the model failed to converge, a heterogeneous Toeplitz 
structure (TOEPH option in PROC MIXED) was used. If the model still failed to converge, the compound 
symmetry structure (CS option in PROC MIXED) was used. The Kenward-Rogers correction to degrees 
of freedom was applied (DDFM=KR option in PROC MIXED). The least square (LS) means (and 
standard errors [SEs]) for each treatment as well as the treatment difference from the model at Week 
8 were presented along with the 90% and 95% 2-sided CIs. To prove the 2 products to be biosimilar, 
the confidence limits for the LS means difference had to be within the equivalence margin of 3.5 letters 
at Week 8 (90% CI for United States and 95% CI for ROW). 
Results 
Participant flow 
One thousand and forty-three patients were screened for eligibility of whom 582 were randomised 292 
to the Ximluci arm and 290 to the Lucentis arm. All patients randomised to Ximluci arm and 289 
patients randomised to Lucentis were dosed. 
The primary endpoint was evaluated at Week 8 by which time there were 5 (1.7%) treatment 
discontinuations from Ximluci and 8 (2.8%) from Lucentis. 
At week 52 a total of 96 subjects (16.5%) discontinued the study treatment early, including 47 
subjects(16.1%) in the Ximluci group and 49 subjects (16.9%) in the Lucentis group. The most 
common 
reason for early discontinuation of study treatment in both groups was subject request (ie, 
withdrawal of consent).  
The primary endpoint was evaluated at Week 8 by which time there were 4 (1.4%) treatment 
discontinuations from Ximluci and 6 (2.1%) from Lucentis.

The original protocol (version 1.0, dated 02 November 2018), was amended 4 times. The most 
relevant amendments are those for Amendments 3, 4 and 5, which are summarised below. 
Protocol Amendment 3, Version 1.0 (dated 06 May 2020) 
•  Clarification around equivalence margin of ±3.5, as agreed with the EMA/FDA. 
•  Updated the PK substudy sample size from 60 to between approximately 40 to 60 subjects 
based on ongoing discussion with the EMA due to the increased risk of COVID-19 exposure 
during the COVID-19 pandemic in connection to additional visits that the PK substudy 
mandates. 
•  Clarification added to exclusion criteria 1 and 6 to explain non-applicable circumstances due to 
medical condition of the fellow eye, in cases where a subject had only 1 eye or their fellow eye 
fulfilled additional criteria (as specified). 
•  Clarification to exclusion criterion 5 to exclude subfoveal fibrosis, subfoveal atrophy, and/or 
scarring extending >50% of total lesion area in the study eye as assessed by the investigator 
at screening and confirmed by the CRC prior to Randomisation; change was implemented 
throughout the protocol. 
•  Addition of text regarding the difference in approach around the CI used for evaluation of study 
results between the United States (90% CI) and ROW (95% CI) as agreed upon with the 
relevant regulatory authorities; change was implemented throughout the protocol. 
• 
The interim analysis at Month 2 was removed following additional discussions with the EMA, as 
the agency felt this analysis could potentially jeopardise the integrity of the study. 
•  Clarification that subjects with only 1 eye or fellow eye with opaque optical media opacity can 
be considered for study participation by the investigator under specific circumstances. 
•  Clarification added to the statistical methods section as to how the data will be handled due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Protocol Amendment 4, Version 1.0 (dated 26 November 2020) 
Due to the high number of PDs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the strategy for the efficacy 
analyses was updated to be more in line with the ICH E9 Addendum estimand approach. The 
definitions of the primary efficacy estimand and IEs were added and it was stated that this will be the 
primary assessment of biosimilarity. 
•  Removal of the per-protocol set, adding that all efficacy analyses will use the FAS using 
estimand methodology. The review of IEs as part of the blinded data review meeting including 
the PDs related to COVID-19 was detailed. 
•  Clarification regarding the missing data assumptions relating to primary and sensitivity 
analyses for each endpoint/estimand. Added a statement that primarily, COVID-19 related 
missing data will be treated as MAR. 
•  Updated the analysis of response endpoints using the Miettinen-Nurminen method rather than 
the Newcombe. 
Protocol Version Amendment 5, Version 1.0 (dated 24 February 2021) 
•  Clarification regarding the maintenance of masking in connection to the interim analysis. Text 
was added to clarify that subject treatment assignments will not be revealed in connection to 
the interim analysis and thereby the masking of the study will be maintained.

•  Central provision of BD needles and syringes was suspended until further notice, per company 
decision. 
Protocol deviations 
The number of subjects who had at least 1 major protocol deviation was balanced across both 
treatment groups. In the Ximluci group, 131 subjects (44.9%) had 257 major PDs. In the Lucentis 
group, 133 subjects (45.9%) had 267 major PDs. The most common major PDs in both groups were 
related to missed visits: “COVID-19 – missed visit” (16.1% of subjects in the Ximluci group and 15.9% 
of subjects in the Lucentis group) and “procedure not per protocol – missed (omitted) assessment” 
(12.7% of subjects in the Ximluci group and 13.1% of subjects in the Lucentis group).  
A total of 16 subjects (5.5%) in the Ximluci group and 6 subjects (2.1%) in the Lucentis group had a 
major PD in the category of “stratification error”. All of these stratification errors were related to the 
BCVA letters at Baseline group (55 letters or lower, 56 to 65 letters, 66 letters or higher), where the 
site inadvertently entered the incorrect Baseline BCVA stratification group at the Randomisation visit; 
however, these deviations did not impact the overall balanced distribution of assignment to the 2 
treatments by Baseline BCVA group (see Section 10.4.1). An additional 3 subjects (2 subjects in the 
Ximluci group and 1 subjects in the Lucentis group) had similar stratification errors related to the site 
entering the incorrect Baseline BCVA stratification group, but these were not recorded as major PDs 
under the category of “stratification error.” The subgroup analysis of BCVA letters at Baseline used the 
actual BCVA value at Baseline; therefore, the stratification errors, which were human errors at the site, 
did not have an impact on the subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by Baseline BCVA category. 
The number of subjects who had at least 1 major PD in relation to COVID-19 was balanced across both 
treatment groups. In the Ximluci group, 63 subjects (21.6%) had 127 major PDs in relation to COVID-
19. In the Lucentis group, 62 subjects (21.4%) had 123 major PDs in relation to COVID-19. . Major 
PDs in relation to COVID-19 included missed visits (16.1% of subjects in the Ximluci group and 15.9% 
of subjects in the Lucentis group), study procedure not performed per protocol (4.5% of subjects in 
the Ximluci group and 6.6% of subjects in the Lucentis group), visit out-of-window (1.4% of subjects 
in the Ximluci group and 1.0% of subjects in the Lucentis group), and “other” COVID-related PDs 
(2.7% of subjects in the Ximluci group and 0.7% of subjects in the Lucentis group). 
Baseline data 
The demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the Ximluci and Lucentis 
treatment groups. The mean age of subjects in the Ximluci group was 74.5 (8.68) years and 73.8 
(8.25) years in the Lucentis group. The majority of subjects (44.2%) in both groups were were in the 
70 to 79 years age group, followed by 27.7% of subjects in the 80+ years age group and 23.4% in the 
60 to 69 years age group. There was a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the 80+ years age 
group in the Ximluci group (31.2%) compared to the Lucentis group (24.1%). 
Just over half of the subjects were female, 57.5% in the Ximluci group and 54.1% in the Lucentis 
group.  Just over 70% were recruited from Europe, 72.6% in the Ximluci and 73.1% in the Lucentis 
group.  
The distribution of category of baseline visual acuity was also similar across treatment groups. 
Approximately 26% in both treatment arms had a baseline BCVA of 55 or less letters. Thirty six 
percent of those treated with Ximluci and 34.5% of those treated with Lucentis had a BCVA of 56 to 65 
letters. Thirty seven point seven percent in the Ximluci arm and 39% in the Lucentis arm had a BCVA 
of 66, or higher letters.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study was the change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline 
using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol for the study eye. 
Descriptive statistics 
At Baseline, the mean BCVA score was 61.7 letters in the Ximluci group and 61.5 letters in the Lucentis 
group. Subjects in both the Ximluci group and the Lucentis group responded well to treatment over the 
52 weeks of the study based on the observed improvements in visual acuity. At Week 52, the mean 
BCVA score was 69.3 letters in the Ximluci group and 70.7 letters in the Lucentis group. Small 
numerical differences in BCVA letter scores (by approximately 1 to 2.5 letters) were observed across 
the  groups over the visits (Table 6) Given the lack of directional consistency of the observed numerical 
difference with the anatomical endpoints, this was concluded not to be due to any structural 
differences between the products.

Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary analysis (MMRM, evaluable data for primary estimand analyses, with missing data 
assumed to be missing at random) for the change from Baseline in BCVA letter score in the study eye 
for the FAS at Week 8, showed that the LS means (SE) change from Baseline in BCVA was 4.57 
(0.527) letters in the Ximluci group and 6.37 (0.537) letters in the Lucentis group. The LS means (SE) 
difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was -1.79 (0.684) letters and the LS means difference 95% CI 
was -3.14 to -0.45 which was within the equivalence margin of -3.5 to 3.5 letters (Table 7).

was to estimate the treatment differences under the scenario of no IEs. Only evaluable data were included in this analysis. No data 
were imputed prior to analysis but the MMRM analysis employs a hypothetical strategy, assuming that non-evaluable and missing 
data due to IEs are missing at random. P-values for LS mean differences are 2-sided and test for non-zero difference between the 
treatments. Presented statistics are based on the FAS and the randomised treatment. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint (primary estimand analysis) 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of missing data assumptions using an 
ANCOVA model. 
A sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA by week for change from Baseline in the BCVA letter score in the 
study eye (evaluable data for primary estimand analyses) for the FAS showed similar results to the 
MMRM analysis. At Week 8, the LS means (SE) difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was -1.7 (0.70) 
with 95% CI from -3.1 to -0.4 letters for data missing completely at random (MCAR) and also for data 
missing not at random (MNAR) (Table 8).

a No data are imputed. 
b Missing data are multiply imputed using a defined Pattern Mixture Model as per the Statistical Analysis Plan employing a 
hypothetical strategy. Subjects with data MNAR are assumed to return to an average baseline level that is observed in this 
population. Otherwise data are multiply imputed assuming data are missing at random. Notes: The objective of the primary 
estimand analysis was to estimate the treatment differences under the scenario of no IEs. Evaluable data is any data collected that 
was not impacted by an IE. Only evaluable data are included in these analyses. Separate ANCOVA models were performed for each 
visit. P-values for LS mean differences are 2-sided and test for non-zero difference between the treatments. Presented statistics are 
based on the FAS and the randomised treatment.  
A further sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA by week for change from Baseline in the BCVA letter score 
in the study eye (evaluable data for primary estimand analyses) using BOCF and LOCF for the FAS 
showed similar results (Table 9). At Week 8, the LS means (SE) difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis 
was -1.5 (0.67) letters for both missing and non-evaluable data imputed using BOCF and imputed 
using LOCF. The LS means difference 95% CI were both within the equivalence margin of -3.5 to 3.5 
letters.

A sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA by week for change from Baseline in the BCVA letter score in the 
study eye (observed data for secondary estimand analyses) for the FAS produced similar results to the 
primary analysis. At Week 8, the LS means (SE) difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was -1.94 
(0.688) with 95% CI -3.29 to -0.59 letters for data missing completely at random (MCAR) and -1.65 
(0.676) with 95% CI -2.97 to -0.33 letters for data missing not at random (MNAR).Likewise an 
ANCOVA by week for change from Baseline in the BCVA letter score in the study eye (observed data 
for secondary estimand analyses) for the FAS produced similar results to the primary analysis using 
BOCF and LOCF to impute for missing and non-evaluable data. At Week 8, the LS means (SE) 
difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was -1.67 (0.657) with 95% CI -2.96 to -0.38 letters using BOCF 
and -1.41 (0.703) with 95% CI -2.79 to 0.03 using LOCF.

Descriptive statistics showing BCVA letter score by visit are shown in Table 11. This information is also 
presented graphically in Figure 3. Improvements in visual acuity were observed in both treatment 
groups at Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 52 with increases from Baseline in mean BCVA letter score 
observed at all visits. Small numerical differences in BCVA letter scores (by approximately 1 to 2.5 
letters) were observed across the groups.

Percentage of subjects with gain of ≥15 letters using ETDRS, evaluated as change at Week 
4, Week 8, Week 24, and Week 52 compared to Baseline in the study eye 
The percentage of subjects with a gain of ≥15 BCVA letters compared to Baseline increased over the 
time points in both the Ximluci and Lucentis groups. A slightly higher percentage of subjects in the 
Lucentis group had a gain of ≥15 letters compared to the Ximluci group across the time points. In the 
Ximluci group, 6.8% of subjects at Week 8, 12.0% at Week 16, 15.8% at Week 24, and 17.1% at 
Week 52 had a gain of ≥15 letters compared to Baseline. In the Lucentis group, 14.1% of subjects at 
Week 8, 17.6% at Week 16, 18.6% at Week 24, and 21.4% at Week 52 had a gain of ≥15 letters 
compared to Baseline. (Table 12).

Change from Baseline in the Percentage of Subjects With Loss of <15 BCVA Letters 
The percentage of subjects who had a loss of <15 BCVA letters compared to Baseline decreased 
slightly over the 52 weeks of the study but still remained high in both the Ximluci and Lucentis groups, 
indicating subjects in both groups responded well to treatment. The results were similar between the 
Ximluci and Lucentis groups across all post-Baseline visits. At Week 24, the percentage of subjects who 
had a loss of <15 BCVA letters compared to Baseline was 78.8% in the Ximluci group and 77.9% in 
the Lucentis group. At Week 52, the percentage of subjects who had a loss of <15 BCVA letters 
compared to Baseline was 68.8% in the Ximluci group and 67.6% in the Lucentis group.

The MMRM analysis (evaluable data for Estimand 1 analyses) for the change from Baseline in CFT in 
the study eye for the FAS is presented in Table 15. The changes from Baseline in CFT in the study eye 
were similar between the Ximluci and Lucentis group over the first 52 weeks of the study and no 
statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed at any time point. Similar 
results were seen with ANCOVA analyses using a missing completely at random assumption and also 
when a missing completely at random assumption was made. The analyses were repeated for 
Estimand 2 with broadly similar results.

Notes: The objective of the estimand 1 analysis was to estimate the treatment differences under the scenario of no IEs. Evaluable 
data were any data collected which were not impacted by an IE. Only evaluable data were included in this analysis. No data were 
imputed prior to analysis but the MMRM analysis employs a hypothetical strategy, assuming that non-evaluable and missing data 
due to IEs are missing at random. Presented statistics are based on the FAS and the randomised treatment. Source: Table

A sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA by week for change from Baseline in the CFT in the study eye 
(evaluable data for Estimand 1 analyses) for the FAS provided similar results.  
Change in total size of choroidal neovascular leakage area in the study eye measured by FA 
at Week 24 and Week 52 compared to Baseline 
A similar reduction in the total size of choroidal neovascular leakage area in the study eye was 
observed in both treatment groups. At Baseline, the mean total size of choroidal neovascular leakage 
area in the study eye measured by FA was 6.278 mm2 in the Ximluci group and 5.866 mm2 in the 
Lucentis group. At Week 24, the mean change from Baseline in the total size of choroidal neovascular 
leakage area was -3.601 mm2 in the Ximluci group and -3.320 mm2 in the Lucentis group. At Week 52, 
the mean change from Baseline in the total size of choroidal neovascular leakage area was -4.130 mm2 
in the Ximluci group and -3.494 mm2 in the Lucentis group.

Change from Baseline in Size and/or Number of Intraretinal Cystoid Space (Cysts), 
Subretinal Fluid, and Retinal Pigment Epithelium Detachments in the Study Eye 
Intraretinal cysts (assessed by qualitative morphology based OCT) 
At Baseline, in the Ximluci group, 131 subjects (44.9%) had 0 cysts, 14 subjects (4.8%) had 0-1 
cysts, 19 subjects (6.5%) had 1-2 to 5 cysts, 126 subjects (43.2%) had 2 to >5 cysts, and 2 subjects 
0.7%) had missing data. 
At Baseline, in the Lucentis group, 140 subjects (48.3%) had 0 cysts, 9 subjects (3.1%) had 0-1 cysts, 
16 subjects (5.5%) had 1-2 to 5 cysts, 123 subjects (42.4%) had 2 to >5 cysts, and 2 subjects 
(0.7%) had missing data. 
At the last on-treatment assessment, in the Ximluci group, 207 subjects (70.9%) had 0 cysts, 10 
subjects (3.4%) had 0-1 cysts, 27 subjects (9.2%) had 1-2 to 5 cysts, 43 subjects (14.7%) had 2 to 
>5 cysts, and 5 subjects (1.7%) had missing data. At the last on-treatment assessment, in the 
Lucentis group, 197 subjects (67.9%) had 0 cysts, 10 subjects (3.4%) had 0-1 cysts, 24 subjects 
(8.3%) had 1-2 to 5 cysts, 54 subjects (18.6%) had 2 to >5 cysts, and 5 subjects (1.7%) had missing 
data. 
CMH analysis (evaluable data for Estimand 1 analyses) for intraretinal cystoid space (cysts) in the 
study eye measured by qualitative morphology-based OCT showed that at Week 24 and 52, there were 
no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the cumulative proportion of 
subjects who had intraretinal cysts in any of the following categories: no more than 0 cysts, no more 
than 0-1 cysts, and no more than 1-2 to 5 cysts. At Week 52, for data MAR and when missing and 
non-evaluable data were imputed using BOCF, there were no significant differences between treatment 
groups in the cumulative proportion of subjects who had intraretinal cysts in any of the mentioned 
categories. 
At Week 24, the difference (Ximluci versus Lucentis) in the cumulative proportion of subjects who had 
no more than 0 intraretinal cysts was 4.3% (90% CI: -2.0 to 10.5; 95% CI: -3.2 to 11.7) for data 
MAR. At Week 52, the difference (Ximluci versus Lucentis) in the cumulative proportion of subjects 
who had no more than 0 intraretinal cysts was 5.5% (90% CI: -1.0 to 11.9; 95% CI: -2.2 to 13.2) for 
data MAR. 
Subretinal fluid  
At Baseline, the mean subretinal fluid in the study eye was lower in the Ximluci group (34.3 μm) 
compared to the Lucentis group (50.1 μm). Decreases in subretinal fluid were observed at all post-
Baseline visits in both treatment groups, with larger decreases from Baseline observed in the Lucentis 
group consistently across all time points. At the last on-treatment assessment, the mean subretinal 
fluid in the study eye was 8.2 μm in the Ximluci group and 15.5 μm in the Lucentis group. 
The MMRM analysis (evaluable data for Estimand 1 analyses) for the change from Baseline in the 
amount of subretinal fluid in the study eye measured by OCT for the FAS at  Week 24, showed the LS

means (SE) change from Baseline in subretinal fluid was -32.67 (2.209)μm in the Ximluci group and -
32.29 (2.263)μm in the Lucentis group. The LS means (SE) difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was 
-0.38 (2.838)μm (90% CI: -5.05 to 4.30; 95% CI: -5.95 to 5.20). At Week 52, the LS means (SE) 
change from Baseline in subretinal fluid was -34.88 (2.133) μm in the Ximluci group and -32.93 
(2.180) μm in the Lucentis group. The LS means (SE) difference for Ximluci versus Lucentis was -1.95 
(2.687) μm (90% CI: -6.38 to 2.48; 95% CI: -7.23 to 3.33). 
Retinal pigment detachments 
At Baseline, the mean width of retinal pigment epithelium detachments in the study eye was 3216.8 
μm in the Ximluci group and 3114.9 μm in the Lucentis group. The mean height of retinal pigment 
epithelium detachments in the study eye was 224.8 μm in the Ximluci group and 213.3 μm in the 
Lucentis group. 
Decreases in the width and height of retinal pigment epithelium detachments were observed at all 
post-Baseline visits in both treatment groups.  
At the last on-treatment assessment, the mean change from Baseline in the width of retinal pigment 
epithelium detachments was -204.2 μm in the Ximluci group and -173.9 μm in the Lucentis group. 
At the last on-treatment assessment, the mean change from Baseline in the height of retinal pigment 
epithelium detachments was -81.7 μm in the Ximluci group and -66.1 μm in the Lucentis group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The change from Baseline in the BCVA letter score in the study eye was presented and analysed by the 
following subgroups, which were related to the stratification factors used for randomisation: 
• 
Eye colour (light iris or dark iris) 
•  BCVA letters at Baseline (≤ 55 letters, 56 - 65 letters, ≥ 66 letters) 
•  Geographical region where enrolled (Asia, Europe, or America)

Notes: The objective of the primary estimand analysis was to estimate the treatment differences under 
the scenario of no IEs. Evaluable data is any data collected which was not impacted by an IE. Only 
evaluable data are included in this analysis. No data are imputed prior to analysis but the MMRM 
analysis employs a hypothetical strategy, assuming that non-evaluable and missing data due to IEs are 
missing at random. Presented statistics are based on the FAS and the randomised treatment.

Design 
EudraCT Number: 2018-002930-19 
A phase 3 multicentre, double-blind (double-masked), randomised, parallel group study 
in subjects with wet age-related macular degeneration. 583 subjects were enrolled and 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Lucentis (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) 
or the investigational product, Ximluci (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab), in the study 
eye once every 4 weeks/monthly for 52 weeks (ie, 12 months).  
As agreed with EMA, an unmasked analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints as well as 
PK and immunogenicity was performed when 6-month (ie, 24 weeks) data for all 
subjects on the study was collected. The MAA is based on a data cut off point of all 
patients who completed 6 months of treatment. The remaining data will be provided 
to EMA during the review phase in the Day 120 response package.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant submitted one randomised double blind active controlled equivalence study (Xplore) with 
Lucentis the reference product for intravitreal ranibizumab as the active control. Patients were treated 
with monthly intravitreal injections of Ximluci or Lucentis over a 12-month study period. Although in 
Europe the most frequent regimen for the treatment with ranibizumab is Treat and Extend, the 
monthly dosages represent a suitable treatment regimen for a clinical study comparing Ximluci and 
Lucentis. The selected monthly regimen provides the maximum ranibizumab available dose, which is a 
conservative approach from a methodological point of view. Since this was the regimen tested versus 
sham in the original dossier of Lucentis for the treatment of nAMD, it can be considered an adequate 
reference. 
The study was conducted in patients aged over 50 with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. 
The study has a duration of 52 weeks. At the time of submission of the application for marketing 
authorisation data on efficacy was only available up to Week 24. Further data up to and including 52 
weeks was submitted in the course of the procedure. 
Given that this is a biosimilar application and the aim is to demonstrate similarity to the reference 
product the submission of one study is acceptable. It is also acceptable to allow the extrapolation of 
findings from the pivotal study in one indication to the other indications of the authorised reference 
product in light of the Applicant’s justification.  
The Applicant obtained a number of scientific advice letters from the CHMP, which mainly focused on 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the primary endpoint and the equivalence margin. In general, the 
Applicant has followed the advice.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally suitable for a clinical efficacy study evaluating 
equivalence for biosimilarity. The population included patients aged 50 or more with a new diagnosis of 
nAMD, a baseline visual acuity between 49 and 73 letters inclusive and a total lesion area ≤ 9-disc 
areas.  The Applicant has followed scientific advice to recruit a reasonably homogeneous population in 
order to increase the chances that any differences between products can be detected. However, 
regarding the exclusion criteria for myopia (Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye 
that demonstrated more than 8 diopters of myopia), the applicant has not followed the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 77/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation of the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/778937/2018 that stated that patients with 
6 or more diopters of myopia should not be included. However, this was accepted as this criterion was 
aligned with one of the registration trials for ranibizumab (MARINA/ANCHOR) and the risk of harm to 
patients was considered low. 
The Applicant, in the course of the product development, changed the primary endpoint from change 
from baseline in central foveal thickness at Week 8 to change from baseline in best corrected visual 
acuity at Week 8. The choice of this endpoint had been encouraged during scientific advice, although 
the Applicant’s initial proposal of ‘change in the central foveal thickness’ (CFT) as the primary endpoint 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP in the previous advice as CFT is an objective measurement. It 
was also noted by the CHMP that VA measurements register the patient's performance, which may be 
affected by factors other than eye functionality, such as cognitive health and interaction with study 
personnel. Using an endpoint with low variability allows for fewer patients to undergo study procedures 
and medication CFT, the variable for the proposed primary endpoint, is intrinsically related to the 
pathology of the indication, wet AMD, and to the mode of action of ranibizumab.  
Given, that it has been noted that in clinical trials the effect of Lucentis reaches a plateau at about 12 
weeks, the use of change from baseline at 8 weeks was accepted as per scientific advice to be the 
most sensitive time point to detect any differences between Lucentis and Ximluci.  
The Applicant also complied with advice to include a comparison of change in BCVA from baseline at 
other time points including week 4 as well as later time points. The Applicant also included CFT 
measured by OCT at a number of time points as secondary endpoint and has followed the 
recommendation of the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/295631/2018 regarding the inclusion of one 
earlier time-point (1-2 weeks) for the assessment and to further strengthen the evidence for 
biosimilarity. In fact, the CST was the primary endpoint in the pivotal study of another biosimilar 
product of Lucentis currently authorized by EMA (Byooviz). 
The remaining secondary endpoints e.g. a responder analysis for gain in ≥ 15 letters from baseline and 
loss of < 15 letters from baseline, change from baseline at different time points in central foveal 
thickness, changes in lesion size, volume of intra and subretinal fluid etc are all considered to be 
relevant.  
Initially there were some uncertainties regarding the masking of the study. These have now been 
resolved and it is considered that there was appropriate masking of the study.  
An interim analysis at Week 8 of change from baseline in BCVA (primary endpoint) was conducted 
once all recruited patients had either discontinued or completed 24 weeks of treatment. The Applicant 
has confirmed that there were robust systems in place to prevent unmasking following the interim 
analysis.  
Biosimilarity was to be concluded if the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in mean change in 
BCVA at Week 8 between Ximluci and Lucentis was confined within the equivalence margin of ±3.5 
letters. A meta-analysis of the ANCHOR and MARINA studies in Lucentis focusing on Week 8 data 
concluded that the difference in mean change in BCVA between treatment and placebo was 7.7 letters. 
In order to ensure that the proposed equivalence margin would preserve at least 50% of the lower 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference in mean change in BCVA between treatment arms an equivalence 
margin of ±3.5 letters was chosen. The choice of equivalence margin was supported by the EMA in 
recent scientific advice. 
The study was conducted during the COVID 19 pandemic. As a consequence of protocol deviations 
related to the pandemic the Applicant changed their approach to the analysis of the primary endpoint 
in the protocol with a switch from a planned ANCOVA analysis to an estimand approach using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) with missing data assumed to be missing at random.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 78/125 
 
 
 
The proportion of subjects (about 45%) having major protocol deviations up to and including Week 52, 
though high, was similar in both treatment arms. The most common major PDs in both groups were 
related to missed visits: “COVID-19 – missed visit” (16.1% of subjects in the Ximluci arm and 15.9% 
of subjects in the Lucentis arm). 
Sixteen subjects (5.5%) in the Ximluci arm and 6 subjects (2.1%) in the Lucentis arm were mis-
stratified. These were categorised as major protocol deviations. All stratification errors were related to 
baseline BCVA category where the site inadvertently entered the incorrect Baseline BCVA stratification 
group at the Randomisation visit.  
An additional 4 subjects (2 subjects in the Ximluci group and 1 subject in the Lucentis group) had 
similar stratification errors related to the site entering the incorrect Baseline BCVA stratification group, 
but these were not recorded as major PDs under the category of “stratification error.” 
Whilst the applicant claims that the mis-stratification did not affect the overall balance of the 
assignment to the treatment arms, nevertheless the Applicant was asked to provide information on 
whether the mis-assignment had any impact on the sub-group analysis of the primary endpoint by 
baseline BCVA category. The Applicant has confirmed that actual BCVA was used in the sub-group 
analysis and therefore there was no impact on the sub-group analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint. At week 8 the gain from baseline in BCVA for Ximluci was 4.6 
letters (95% CI from 3.5 to 5.6 letters). For Lucentis the gain was 6.4 letters (95% CI from 5.3 to 7.4 
letters). It should be noted that the gain in BCVA was numerically greater for Lucentis than Ximluci at 
all assessed time points both in the primary analysis and in sub-group analyses by iris colour and 
category of BCVA. The LS mean difference in change from baseline BCVA between the two treatment 
arms at Week 8 was – 1.8 letters with 95% CI from -3.1 to -0.4 letters. As the 95% CI were within the 
margins of ± 3.5 letters it can be concluded that equivalence has been demonstrated at Week 8, even 
though it could be concluded that Ximluci was statistically inferior to Lucentis at Week 8.  Similar 
results to the primary analysis were also demonstrated in a number of sensitivity analyses. However, 
peak improvement in BCVA was seen at Week 20 rather than Week 12. Nevertheless, the proportional 
major changes from baseline were seen at weeks 4-8. 
Small numerical differences in change from Baseline in BCVA letter score were observed between 
treatment groups at some visits, although there was some variability, the observed differences were 
relatively stable over 52 weeks. The convergence between the two treatment arms at Week 52 suggest 
that these differences did not increase over time. Given the lack of directional consistency of the 
observed numerical difference with the anatomical endpoints, this was concluded not to be due to any 
structural differences between the products. 
Even though Ximluci and Lucentis were judged to be highly similar at the quality level and despite the 
fact that Ximluci met its primary endpoint at Week 8, a time-point that was thought to be most 
sensitive to differences in efficacy between the treatment arms, an increase in the difference in change 
in BCVA from baseline between the two treatment arms is seen at Week 20 and particularly at Week 
24. At Week 20 the LS mean for change from baseline in BCVA was 6.1 for Ximluci and 8.1 for 
Lucentis. The LS mean difference was -1.9 with 95% CI from -3.5 to -0.3. At Week 24 the LS mean for 
change from baseline in BCVA was 5.8 for Ximluci and 8.1 for Lucentis. The LS mean difference was -
2.3 with 95% CI -4.0 to -0.6.  
The Applicant provided data for the second six months (weeks 28 to 52 in 4 weekly intervals) of 
treatment which showed that Lucentis continued to perform better than Ximluci and the lower 95% CI 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 79/125 
 
 
 
 
for LS mean difference was below -3.5 letters for all time points in the second 6 months and below – 4 
for all except week 28 and 52. However, the divergence between the two treatment arms at Week 52 
was lower than at Week 24, suggesting that these differences did not increase over time.  
High degree of similarity  between the treatment arms was seen for a number of secondary endpoints. 
Ximluci and Lucentis demonstrate a high degree of similarity of treatment effects on sensitive 
anatomical endpoints including CFT, total size of CNV leakage area, number of intraretinal cysts, 
amount of sub-retinal fluid and size of retinal PEDs.  
In the course of the procedure the Applicant has provided an acceptable justification for extrapolation 
of the indication to the remaining Lucentis indications.  
2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the totality of the evidence, i.e. analytical biosimilarity, the fact that the pivotal trial 
demonstrated equivalence of Ximluci to Lucentis in change from baseline BCVA at week 8 (which was 
considered a sensitive timepoint) and similar improvements in anatomical endpoints, the CHMP 
concluded that biosimilarity of Ximluci to Lucentis has been demonstrated. 
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety data reported includes 582 randomised subjects, of which 581 subjects were included in the 
SS.  
All 292 subjects in the Ximluci group, and 289 out of 290 subjects in the Lucentis group were included 
in the safety set (SS); 1 subject in the Lucentis group was excluded from the SS because the subject 
withdrew consent and was not dosed with study drug.  
Table 20: Subject Enrollment, Randomisation, and Dosing (Enrolled Set) 
Subjects were randomised across 15 countries including the United States and countries in Europe, the 
Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. All 292 subjects randomised to the Ximluci group were dosed with study 
drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 80/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of subjects were recruited from Europe (72.9%), followed by Asia (14.2%), and the 
United States (12.9%). 
The mean overall ranibizumab exposure was 5.78 mg in the Ximluci group and 5.80 mg in the Lucentis 
group. The mean ranibizumab treatment duration was 311.9 days in the Ximluci group and 312.3 days 
in the Lucentis group.  
A total of 184 subjects (63.0%) in the Ximluci group and 178 subjects (61.6%) in the Lucentis group 
received all 13 doses of ranibizumab over the study. 
The extent of exposure for the Safety Set (SS) was similar between treatment groups is 
summarised in Table 21. 
Table 21: Extent of Exposure (Safety Set) 
The full 52-week safety data set has been submitted in the D120 LoQ response package. The new data 
has been integrated into the full safety analysis.  
A summary of treatment and study visit completion by treatment group and overall for the FAS 
is provided in Table 22. 
All 292 subjects randomised to the Ximluci group were dosed with study drug.  
A total of 290 subjects were randomised to the Lucentis group, of which 289 subjects were 
dosed with study drug; 1 subject in the Lucentis group withdrew consent and was not dosed with 
study drug.  
A total of 96 subjects (16.5%) discontinued the study treatment early, including 47 subjects 
(16.1%) in the Ximluci group and 49 subjects (16.9%) in the Lucentis group.  
The most common reason for early discontinuation of study treatment in both groups was subject 
request (ie, withdrawal of consent). 
The mean (SD) treatment duration was similar between groups: 44.560 (11.2050) weeks in the

2.4.8.1.  Adverse events 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye was similar between 
the Ximluci group (105 subjects, 36.0%) and the Lucentis group (104 subjects, 36.0%). The majority 
of ophthalmic TEAEs in both treatment groups were mild in severity (Table 23). 
In the Ximluci group, 23 subjects (7.9%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of moderate intensity and 4 subjects 
(1.4%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of severe intensity in the study eye. In the Lucentis group, 26 subjects 
(9.0%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of moderate intensity and 6 subjects (2.1%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of 
severe intensity in the study eye. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic study drug-related TEAE in the study eye 
was similar between the Ximluci group (22 subjects [7.5%]; 29 events) and the Lucentis group (28 
subjects [9.7%]; 41 events). Four subjects (1.4%) in the Ximluci group and 4 subjects (1.4%) in the 
Lucentis group experienced a serious ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye.  
One subject (0.3%) in the Ximluci group and 2 subjects (0.7%) in the Lucentis group experienced an 
ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug.

The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye that was associated 
with an injection site reaction was similar between the Ximluci (12.3%) and the Lucentis group 
(12.8%).

Common and Non-serious adverse events 
A summary of ophthalmic TEAEs (reported in >1% of subjects) in either treatment group in the 
study eye) by SOC and PT for the SS is presented in Table 24. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye was overall similar 
between the Ximluci (105 subjects [36.0%]; 164 events) and the Lucentis group 
(104 subjects [36.0%]; 183 events). The most common ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye in both 
treatment groups was conjunctival haemorrhage, which was reported in 15 subjects (5.1%) in the 
Ximluci group and 16 subjects (5.5%) in the Lucentis group. The other most commonly reported 
ophthalmic TEAEs in the study eye (reported in ≥10 subjects overall) included visual acuity reduced, 
retinal haemorrhage, retinal pigment epithelial tear, vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, and visual 
impairment. 
The Applicant was asked to further discuss the topic of subretinal fluid and, based on their evaluation, 
to comment on the need to update the product information with this ADR. Twice as many patients 
were reported as having subretinal fluid in the Ximluci group (n=6, 2.1%) compared with n=3 (1.0%) 
for Lucentis. 1 of the subjects in the Ximluci group had a non-serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate 
subretinal fluid in the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug; the event was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. This is not a listed ADR for Lucentis, although ‘retinal 
disorders’ are generally included. The Applicant does not consider an update to the product information 
with the ADR subretinal fluid is required, on the basis of the justification provided with the responses 
and given the demonstration of similarity to Lucentis, a significant difference in ADR profile is not 
plausible. Rather the Applicant provided their rationale behind the conclusion that the numerical 
difference in ADRs reporting subretinal fluid are likely to be a chance finding. Baseline ocular factors in 
the Ximluci treatment group may also have contributed to this finding. 
The Applicant’s response is considered acceptable. It is recommended that this ADR should continue to 
be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.

Non-ophthalmic TEAEs 
An overall summary of non-ophthalmic TEAEs for the SS is presented in Table 25. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 non-ophthalmic TEAE was slightly higher in the 
Lucentis group (153 subjects [52.9%]; 373 events) compared to the Ximluci group 
(134 subjects [45.9%]; 295 events).  
The majority of non-ophthalmic TEAEs in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. 
Two subjects in each group had a non-ophthalmic study drug-related TEAE.  
Non-ophthalmic SAEs were reported in 29 subjects (9.9%) in the Ximluci group and 
31 subjects (10.7%) in the Lucentis group. All non-ophthalmic SAEs in the Ximluci group were 
considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug. In the Lucentis group, 1 non-ophthalmic 
SAE of myocardial infarction was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, all other 
non-ophthalmic SAEs were considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug. 
Two subjects (0.7%) in the Ximluci group and 5 subjects (1.7%) in the Lucentis group experienced a 
non-ophthalmic TEAE that led to withdrawal of study drug.

A total of 4 subjects (2 subjects in each treatment group) experienced a non-ophthalmic treatment-
related TEAE (Table 27). 
In the Ximluci group, 1 subject (0.3%) experienced a treatment-related non-serious TEAE of mild 
myocardial ischaemia and 1 subject (0.3%) experienced a treatment-related non-serious TEAE of mild 
eosinophil count increased. 
The  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  an  explanation  regarding  the  assessment  of  this  event  of  “mild 
myocardial ischaemia”. Following assessment of the Applicant’s response, it is concluded that this does 
not  comply  with  any  of  the  severity  criteria  to  be  considered  a  serious  adverse  event  given  that  this 
event did not lead the patient to hospitalization, did not require extensive procedural or an extensive 
drug treatment, and was not life-threatening. The dose of the study drug was not changed neither.  
In the Lucentis group, 1 subject (0.3%) experienced a treatment-related serious TEAE of severe 
myocardial infarction and 1 subject (0.3%) experienced a treatment-related non-serious TEAE of mild 
liver function test increased.

Overdose 
There were no documented cases of overdose. Based on the demonstration of biosimilarity, this 
application intends to rely on information for Lucentis prescribing information regarding overdose to 
support the safety of Ximluci (see below). 
More concentrated doses as high as 2 mg ranibizumab in 0.05 mL have been administered to patients. 
No additional unexpected adverse reactions were seen. 
2.4.8.3.  Laboratory findings 
Regarding the clinical chemistry, haematology and special test performed (such as slit lamp 
examination, dilated fundus examination, colour fundus photography and fluorescein angiography), the 
results from the 52 week data set are the same as in the interim analysis, no notable trends or 
differences between treatment groups were found.  
Over the 52 weeks of the study, few subjects had a clinically significant abnormality in haematology (7 
subjects in each treatment group) or clinical chemistry (31 subjects in the Ximluci groups versus 40 
subjects in the Lucentis group) laboratory parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 107/125 
 
 
 
 
 
In the same way, no notable trends in changes from baseline of vital signs or notable differences were 
observed between treatment groups. 
Regarding the measurements of intraocular pressure, minimal changes from baseline were observed, 
and they were similar between the Ximluci and the Lucentis group.  
In relation to IOP, the IOP measurements pre-injection and 30 minutes post-injection were similar 
between the Ximluci group and the Lucentis group at all-time points. A small increase in IOP (between 
2 to 3 mmHg) was observed 30 minutes post-injection compared to pre-injection in both treatment 
groups. This is already known to occur with Lucentis and there were no differences identified in the 
Ximluci group. 
There were no significant differences between both treatment groups over the 52 week data.  
2.4.8.4.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation and neutralising antidrug 
antibody (NAb) up to Week 52 after Randomization. An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay 
format that uses labelled (biotinylated and ruthenylated) XSB-001 was employed for screening, with 
confirmatory and titration tiers for ADA performed. The characterization of NAb was performed using a 
Competitive Ligand Binding Assay format (CLBA) that measured the capacity of the test samples to 
inhibit binding of XSB-001 to biotinylated VEGF-165 immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates.  
In order to compare differences in the immunogenic responses between XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) and 
Lucentis, serum samples were collected for evaluation of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing 
anti-drug antibody (NAb) at baseline (Day 0) and weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, and 52. 
The immunogenicity assessment encompassed all patients enrolled in the Xplore study. 
Additional samples to those scheduled for routine immunogenicity testing were collected from patients 
with any sign of intraocular inflammation as they may indicate an immune reaction. 
In line with the updated draft Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived 
therapeutic proteins, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP /14327/2006), immunogenicity was evaluated at baseline in 
order to preclude pre-existing Immunoreactivity. 
The incidence rate of positive ADA and NAb results were similar in the two treatment arms. At 
baseline, the incidence of positive ADA was 12 subjects (4.2%) in the XSB-001 DP group and eight 
subjects (2.9%) in the Lucentis group. 
At Week 24, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was low in both treatment groups: 22 subjects 
(7.5%) in the XSB-001 DP group and 17 subjects (5.9%) in the Lucentis group. This numerically 
higher incidence of positive ADAs in the Ximluci group at week 24 when compared to the Lucentis arm 
had been noted. The applicant has since provided the outstanding immunogenicity data for both 
treatment groups from week 24 onwards and from this additional data there appears to be no notable 
differences in immunogenicity results between the XSB-001 DP and Lucentis groups over time. The 
potential for immunogenicity was observed to be low in the general Xplore study population. The 
incidence of positive results was low (≤ 7.5% of patients at any visit in the XSB- 001 DP (Ximluci) 
group compared with ≤11.9% in the Lucentis group).  
At Week 52, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was 33 subjects (11.3%) in the XSB-001 DP 
(Ximluci) group and 38 subjects (13.1%) in the Lucentis group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 108/125 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of positive results was low (≤ 7.5% of patients at any visit in the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) 
group compared with ≤11.9% in the Lucentis group).  
Most of subjects were determined as ADA negative at each time point during the study. There were no 
notable differences in immunogenicity results between the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) and Lucentis groups 
over time and the incidence of positive ADA was low and overall comparable between treatment 
groups. 
Most detected ADA in the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) and Lucentis treatment groups were non-neutralizing. 
Up to Week 50, no more than one patient had neutralizing antibodies and there was no obvious trend 
of a difference between treatment groups in terms of incidence at each time point.  
Just as the cumulative incidence of positive ADA at Week 52, the incident of neutralizing antibodies 
was highest yet comparable between the treatment groups at 4/16 (25%) and 6/27 (22.2%) in 
XSB-001 DP and Lucentis group, respectively  
A post-hoc analysis comparing subjects with positive ADA post baseline in subjects with negative ADA 
at baseline was similar between the groups and showed that 21 (7.7%) vs. 28 
(10.5%) of subjects in Ximluci and Lucentis group, respectively, that were negative at baseline, at 
some point during the study tested positive for ADA. 
A post-hoc analysis comparing the overall incidence of ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic treatment-
emergent adverse events in subjects with positive ADA was similar between the treatment groups  
The proportion of ADA positive subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye was lower 
in the Ximluci group (10 subjects, 30.3%) compared to the Lucentis group (15 subjects, 39.5%).  
The majority of ophthalmic TEAEs in both treatment groups were mild in severity. In the Ximluci group, 
3 ADA positive subjects (9.1%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of moderate intensity, while no ADA positive 
subjects had ophthalmic TEAEs of severe intensity in the study eye. 
In the Lucentis group, 3 ADA positive subjects (7.9%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of moderate intensity and 
1 ADA positive subject (2.6%) had ophthalmic TEAEs of severe intensity in the study eye  
The proportion of ADA positive subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic drug-related TEAE in the study 
eye was slightly higher in the Ximluci group (3 subjects [9.1%]; 5 events) compared to the Lucentis 
group (3 subjects [7.9%]; 4 events), however the number of events was similar. 
In the Ximluci group, 1 ADA positive subjects (3.0%) had ophthalmic drug related 
TEAEs of moderate intensity in the study eye. In the Lucentis group, 1 ADA positive subject (2.6%) 
had drug-related ophthalmic TEAEs of moderate intensity in the study eye  
Three cases of intravitreal signs of inflammation which could indicate immunoreaction were detected 
during the study duration of 52-weeks (two cases were reported in Lucentis and one in 
Ximluci treatment group).  
In conclusion, the overall safety data does not indicate that Ximluci triggers immunogenicity reactions 
and causes safety related concerns in a larger extent than Lucentis, hence the data suggest that the 
immunogenicity profiles of the products are comparable. Furthermore, the safety profiles (including 
potential immunogenic events) for ADA-positive subjects treated with Ximluci are also comparable to 
the corresponding safety profile for Lucentis.

2.4.8.5.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject (0.3%) in the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) group and 2 subjects (0.7%) in the Lucentis group 
had an ophthalmic TEAE leading to withdrawal of study drug. 
In the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) group, 1 subject had a non-serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate 
subretinal fluid in the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug; the event was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug.  
In the Lucentis group, 1 subject had a non-serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate visual impairment in 
the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug, which was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. A second subject had a serious ophthalmic TEAE of severe endophthalmitis in 
the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug, which was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. 
Two subjects (0.7%) in the Ximluci group and 5 subjects (1.7%) in the Lucentis group had non-
ophthalmic TEAEs leading to withdrawal of study drug; none of these non-ophthalmic TEAEs were 
considered to be related to study drug. 
In the Ximluci group, 2 subjects (0.7%) had non-ophthalmic TEAEs leading to withdrawal 
of study drug: 1 subject had serious TEAEs of anal cancer and vulval cancer, and 1 subject had 
a non-serious TEAE of pneumonia; these non-ophthalmic TEAEs were considered by the 
investigator to be not related to study drug. 
In the Lucentis group, 5 subjects (1.7%) had non-ophthalmic TEAEs leading to withdrawal of 
study drug: 1 subject had a serious TEAE of oesophageal carcinoma, 1 subject had serious 
TEAEs of jaundice and pancreatic carcinoma, 1 subject had a non-serious TEAE of insomnia, 
1 subject had serious TEAEs of bronchial carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, and 1 subject 
had serious TEAEs of atrial fibrillation and renal failure; these non-ophthalmic TEAEs were 
considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug. 
The applicant has now provided the outstanding cumulative data on discontinuation rates from baseline 
to week 52  
A total of 96 subjects (16.5%) discontinued the study treatment early, including 47 subjects (16.1%) 
in the Ximluci group and 49 subjects (16.9%) in the Lucentis group. The most common reason for 
early discontinuation of study treatment in both groups was subject request (ie, withdrawal of 
consent). 
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data relevant for comparability exercise in terms of safety comes from the Xplore study in patients 
with nAMD who were exposed to Ximluci and Lucentis.  
Safety data up to 12 months has now been provided in the final CSR.  Based on the currently available 
data, the safety data is considered supportive of clinical safety biosimilarity between Ximluci and 
Lucentis.

Overall, similar results were observed between the Ximluci group and the Lucentis group for safety 
assessments including laboratory tests, vital signs, slit lamp examinations, dilated fundus 
examinations, IOP measurements, colour fundus photography, and FA. A small increase in IOP 
(between 2 to 3 mmHg) was observed 30 minutes post-injection compared to pre-injection in both 
treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye was similar between 
the Ximluci group (105 subjects, 36.0%) and the Lucentis group (104 subjects, 36.0%). The majority 
of ophthalmic TEAEs in both treatment groups were mild in severity. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic TEAE in the study eye that was associated 
with an injection site reaction was similar between the Ximluci group (12.3%) and the Lucentis group 
(12.8%). 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 ophthalmic study drug-related TEAE in the study eye was 
similar between the Ximluci group (22 subjects [7.5%]; 29 events) and the Lucentis group (28 
subjects [9.7%]; 41 events). Conjunctival haemorrhage, retinal pigment epithelial tear, and injection 
site pain were the most commonly reported ophthalmic study drug-related TEAEs.  
The Applicant was asked to further discuss the topic of subretinal fluid. Twice as many patients were 
reported as having subretinal fluid in the Ximluci group (n=6, 2.1%) compared with n=3 (1.0%) for 
Lucentis. 1 of the subjects in the Ximluci group had a non-serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate 
subretinal fluid in the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug; the event was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. This is not a listed ADR for Lucentis, although ‘retinal 
disorders’ are generally included.  The applicant has provided a detailed discussion in their responses 
acknowledging that 6 out of 292 (2.1%) in the Ximluci group and 3 out of 289 (1.0%) patients in the 
Lucentis-group were reported as having AE sub-retinal fluid in the study eye. Given the equivalence 
demonstrated at the primary, Week 8 timepoint, high degree of similarity demonstrated on sensitive 
anatomical endpoints, pharmacokinetic data as well as the similarity demonstrated in the 
comprehensive comparative analytical assessment package between Ximluci and Lucentis, there is no 
basis to believe that a difference in retinal disorders or sub-retinal fluid specifically is plausible. This is 
considered acceptable. 
Two subjects in each treatment group had a non-ophthalmic study drug-related TEAE. 
The proportion of subjects who had at least 1 non-ophthalmic TEAE was slightly higher in the Lucentis 
group (52.9%) compared to the Ximluci group (45.9%). The majority of non-ophthalmic TEAEs in both 
treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. 
In the Ximluci treatment group, an event of mild myocardial ischaemia was reported (assessed as non-
serious), while an event of severe myocardial infarction was reported in the Lucentis treatment group 
(assessed as serious). Regarding the event of mild myocardial ischaemia, the applicant has provided 
further information about this event. Following assessment of the Applicant’s response, it is concluded 
that this does not comply with any of the severity criteria to be considered a serious adverse event 
given that this event did not lead the patient to hospitalization, did not require extensive procedural or 
an extensive drug treatment, and was not life-threatening. The dose of the study drug was not 
changed either.  
A total of 11 subjects died during the study (8 subjects in the Ximluci group and 3 subjects in the 
Lucentis group); none of the deaths were considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
In the Ximluci group, 1 subject died due to cardiopulmonary failure 1 subject died due to COVID-19; 1 
subject died of unknown cause, 1 subject died of acute renal failure, 1 subject died of cardiac arrest, 1 
subject died of chest pain and COVID-19 , 1 subject died of presumed congestive heart failure; the 
subject had SAEs of urinary tract infection and arthralgia, which were considered by the investigator to 
Assessment report

be not related to study drug and had an outcome of fatal. 1 subject was reported to have died of death 
(biological death). 
In the Lucentis group, 1 subject died due to acute pancreatitis, 1 subject died due to acute pancreatitis 
and myocardial infarction, 1 subject died due to COVID-19. As for the interim analysis, none of the 
deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug in any treatment group. 
However, it is noted that there was a trend towards a slightly higher number of fatal reports for 
Ximluci compared with Lucentis over the 52-week treatment period. The Applicant states that the fatal 
cases reported during the pivotal clinical trial were not considered related to treatment by the 
investigator. In view of the fact that biosimilarity has generally been shown for this product, the 
imbalance in fatal cases noted in the Ximluci treatment group is unlikely to be related to the study 
treatment. Nevertheless, for a small number of fatal cases reported in the Ximluci treatment group, 
sufficient information was initially not submitted. For completeness, the Applicant was requested to 
further discuss the reported imbalance in fatal cases for the Ximluci treatment group and to present 
any further information relating to these cases which may have become available. The applicant has 
provided all available details on the fatal cases noted in the Ximluci treatment group and has discussed 
the slight numerical imbalance in fatal cases is noted.  The applicant has outlined that one possible 
explanation for the slight imbalance in the number of fatalities in the Ximluci vs. Lucentis group is that 
the Ximluci group is represented by slightly older subjects. A total of 11 subjects died during the study 
(8 subjects in the Ximluci group and 3 subjects in the Lucentis group); none of the deaths were 
considered related to study drug. In view of the fact that biosimilarity has generally been shown for 
this product and no difference in safety profiles has been shown, this slight numerical imbalance in 
fatal cases noted in the Ximluci treatment group is unlikely to be related to the study treatment.  
Ophthalmic, serious TEAEs were reported in 4 subjects (1.4%) in the Ximluci group and 4 subjects 
(1.4%) in the Lucentis group. 
Non-ophthalmic serious TEAEs were reported in 28 subjects (9.6%) in the Ximluci group and 31 
subjects (10.7%) in the Lucentis group. 
According to Xplore study protocol, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined as AEs 
that began or worsened in severity after the IVT injection of the study drug; while an AE was defined 
as an event that occur after a patient provides informed consent but before the time of the first dose of 
study drug. 
The event of “hip fracture” for a patient was considered a SAE, but not a serious TEAE. Reviewing the 
narrative of this event, the patient experienced the adverse event after the first IVT injection of the 
study drug (Ximluci). The Applicant was invited to explain why this event was not considered a serious 
TEAE if, according to the definition, this event happened after the first dose of the study drug was 
administered. The applicant has provided a detailed response. It is concluded that the narrative of the 
event is somewhat unclear given that it is said that the event happened after the first injection of the 
treatment (definition of a TEAE) and later it says that it happened on an unkown date, which is 
considered the correct to have recorded the onset date as “unknown date” if the date was not 
provided.  Either way, this explanation is acknowledged and no further explanation is required. 
In the listed SAEs presented in the table 2.5: 9, regarding “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders” events, there are 2 events in total (happened in 2 subjects) in the Lucentis group, but only 
1 event (happened in 1 subject) of dyspnoea is listed. 
In the next table (2.5: 10), regarding “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” events, is listed 
also and event of “pulmonary oedema” (in addition to the event of “dyspnoea”) in the Lucentis group. 
They are counted 2 events in total, which is right. This event might be missing from the previous table.

The applicant has now provided an amended table and has included all the data for the 52 weeks of 
treatment. This data has been reviewed and it is correct. 
One subject (0.3%) in the Ximluci group and 2 subjects (0.7%) in the Lucentis group had an 
ophthalmic TEAE leading to withdrawal of study drug. In the Ximluci group, 1 subject had a non-
serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate subretinal fluid in the study eye that led to withdrawal of study 
drug; the event was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.  
In the Lucentis group, 1 subject had a non-serious ophthalmic TEAE of moderate visual impairment in 
the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug, which was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. A second subject had a serious ophthalmic TEAE of severe endophthalmitis in 
the study eye that led to withdrawal of study drug, which was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. 
In the Ximluci group, 2 subjects (0.7%) had non-ophthalmic TEAEs leading to withdrawal of study 
drug: 1 subject had serious TEAEs of anal cancer and vulval cancer, and 1 subject had a non-serious 
TEAE of pneumonia; these non-ophthalmic TEAEs were considered by the investigator to be not related 
to study drug. 
In the Lucentis group, 5 subjects (1.7%) had non-ophthalmic TEAEs leading to withdrawal of study 
drug: 1 subject had a serious TEAE of oesophageal carcinoma, 1 subject had serious 
TEAEs of jaundice and pancreatic carcinoma, 1 subject had a non-serious TEAE of insomnia, 
1 subject had serious TEAEs of bronchial carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, and 1 subject had 
serious TEAEs of atrial fibrillation and renal failure; these non-ophthalmic TEAEs were considered by 
the investigator to be not related to study drug. 
The results for laboratory tests, vital signs, slit lamp examinations, dilated fundus examinations, IOP 
measurements, colour fundus photography, and FA were similar between the XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) 
group and the Lucentis group. 
Immunogenicity 
To compare the immunogenicity between XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) and Lucentis, blood samples were 
collected for evaluation of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralising anti-drug antibody (NAb) at 
baseline and at various times throughout the study period (Day 0, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, and 52) 
from all patients on the Clinical Phase 3 study. Additional samples for immunogenicity testing were 
collected from patients with any sign of intraocular inflammation as they may indicate an immune 
reaction. 
The full 52-week immunogenicity data has now been submitted.  
In the study drug group, there were 1 sample Nab positive at baseline, at week 12 and at week 20 
versus none in the Lucentis group (table 2.5:13). 
At baseline, the incidence of positive ADA was 12 subjects (4.2%) in the Ximluci group and 8 subjects 
(2.8%) in the Lucentis group. Between baseline and week 12, there were no notable differences in 
immunogenicity results between the Ximluci and Lucentis groups and the incidence of positive ADA was 
similar between treatment groups. At Week 24, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was 7.5% in 
the Ximluci group and 5.9% in the Lucentis group. It was noted that there is a numerically higher 
incidence of positive ADAs in the Ximluci group at week 24 when compared to the Lucentis arm. 
The applicant has since provided the outstanding immunogenicity data for both treatment groups from 
week 24 onwards and from this additional data there appears to be no notable differences in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 117/125 
 
 
 
 
immunogenicity results between the XSB-001 DP and Lucentis groups over time. The potential for 
immunogenicity was observed to be low in the general Xplore study population. The incidence of 
positive results was low (≤ 7.5% of patients at any visit in the XSB- 001 DP (Ximluci) group compared 
with ≤11.9% in the Lucentis group).  
At Week 52, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was 33 subjects (11.3%) in the XSB-001 DP 
(Ximluci) group and 38 subjects (13.1%) in the Lucentis group.  
In conclusion, the overall safety data does not indicate that Ximluci triggers immunogenicity reactions 
and causes safety related concerns in a larger extent than Lucentis, hence the data suggest that the 
immunogenicity profiles of the products are comparable. Furthermore, the safety profiles (including 
potential immunogenic events) for ADA-positive subjects treated with Ximluci are also comparable to 
the corresponding safety profile for Lucentis. 
The mean overall ranibizumab exposure was 5.78 mg in the Ximluci group and 5.80 mg in the Lucentis 
group. 
The mean ranibizumab treatment duration was 311.9 days in the XSB-001 DP group and 312.3 days in 
the Lucentis group. A total of 184 subjects (63.0%) in the Ximluci group and 178 subjects (61.6%) in 
the Lucentis group received all 13 doses of ranibizumab over the study.  
At Week 52, there is a similar trend in reporting adverse events in comparison with the data provided 
at Week 24. The overall safety profile from the available data as reflected by the most frequently 
reported TEAEs, severity of the TEAEs and number reported as related, is generally consistent with the 
known safety profile of Lucentis. The intensity of the TEAEs reported remains mild. 
It  can  be  concluded  that  the  safety  of  Ximluci  was  expected  according  to  the  already  known  safety 
information of Lucentis, and it is in line with its SmPC. 
2.4.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The full 52-week safety data from the pivotal clinical trial has been provided. The overall safety profile 
can be considered similar to that which is already established for Lucentis. From a safety perspective, 
no notable differences in the safety risks have been identified between Ximluci and Lucentis from the 
52-week data provided with the application.

basis of a bridging report making reference to Lucentis. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Ximluci has been developed as a biosimilar ranibizumab using Lucentis as a reference product and is 
intended to be used in the same adult indications as the EU approved reference product Lucentis. 
A comprehensive analytical similarity study was performed by the Applicant for the purpose of 
demonstration of biosimilarity at the quality level. The biosimilarity exercise included a side-by-side 
comparative analytical assessment (batches of EU Lucentis, batches of US Lucentis and batches of 
XSB-001) and stability studies to compare degradation profiles. The applicant’s approach for 
demonstrating biosimilarity is aligned with the relevant EMA guidelines and thus considered acceptable. 
The selection of batches and assignment of criticality of quality attributes (QAs) for the comparative 
assessment is presented in a clear logical manner and is considered acceptable.   
A large panel of methods has been used to characterise and compare the most relevant 
physicochemical and biological quality attributes of the ranibizumab molecule.  
The non-clinical programme included several in vitro pharmacodynamic studies. Binding of XSB-
001, EU Lucentis and US Lucentis to VEGF-A was assessed by surface plasmon resonance 
measurements. Comparability assessment of bioactivity was by means of a reporter gene assay 
involving KDR/NFAT-RE HEK293 cells. The suitability of the reporter gene assay was verified by using a 
HUVEC proliferation assay. Four different isoforms of VEGF-A were included in the studies and most 
weight was given to the results for the predominant isoform 165. In general, binding and bioactivity of 
XSB-001 (Ximluci) were within the defined comparative assessment ranges for the reference products, 
suggesting similarity. A GLP-compliant, single dose comparative study was also conducted to evaluate 
the PK and toxicity profiles of XSB-001 (Ximluci) and Lucentis. The results of this study did not identify 
any significant differences between XSB-001 (Ximluci) and the RMP from a nonclinical perspective.  
The clinical development consisted of one main clinical study a multicentre, double-masked, 
randomised, parallel group, phase 3 study (Study Xplore comparing efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, 
and pharmacokinetics (PK) of XSB-001 DP (Ximluci), (also known as Xlucane during development) to 
that of the reference product Lucentis, in patients with newly diagnosed neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (wAMD). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
At the quality level, the results of the comparative analytical assessment demonstrated that the 
primary and higher order structure, functionally binding and bioactivity to four isoforms of VEGF A of 
XSB-001 DP (Ximluci) is highly comparable to EU Lucentis and US Lucentis. For purity and related 
species, some minor differences were observed in XSB-001 (Ximluci) batches, however, are not 
considered to have any meaningful impact, hence do not impact on the biosimilarity claim.  In 
summary, at the quality level while data presented could support similarity between XSB-001 (Ximluci) 
and both EU and US Lucentis. 
Similarly, the non-clinical programme supports biosimilarity in terms of binding and bioactivity. 
As the main clinical study, the Applicant submitted one randomised controlled study (Xplore) with 
Lucentis as an active comparator in patients with neovascular age related macular degeneration to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 121/125 
 
 
 
support the claim for similarity. The study is an equivalence study with equivalence boundaries of ± 
3.5 letters BCVA.  
In terms of efficacy, the primary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA was assessed at Week 8 (in 
line with scientific advice) when the gain in BCVA for Ximluci was 4.6 letters (95% CI from 3.5 to 5.6 
letters). The gain for Lucentis was 6.4 letters (95% CI from 5.3 to 7.4 letters). The LS mean difference 
in change from baseline BCVA between the two treatment arms at Week 8 was – 1.8 letters with 95% 
CI from -3.1 to -0.4 letters. As the 95% CI were within the margins of ± 3.5 letters it can be 
concluded that equivalence has been demonstrated at Week 8. Furthermore, Ximluci and Lucentis 
demonstrate a high degree of similarity of treatment effects on sensitive anatomical endpoints 
including CFT, total size of CNV leakage area, number of intraretinal cysts, amount of sub-retinal fluid 
and size of retinal PEDs. 
A total of 40 subjects in the Ximluci group and 30 subjects in the Lucentis group were included in the 
PK sub-study. The plasma ranibizumab concentrations were similar between the Xlucane and Lucentis 
groups at Day 1 and Week 20. 
The data relevant for comparability exercise in terms of safety comes from the same study. Only data 
from the interim safety analysis at week 24 was provided with the initial submission. However, the 
outstanding safety data up to week 52 has been provided during the procedure. Following review of 
this 52-week data, the overall safety profile as reflected by the most frequently reported TEAEs, 
severity of the TEAEs and number reported as related, is generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of Lucentis and in line with safety characteristics reported in the Lucentis labelling/SmPC.  
It had been noted that there is a numerically higher incidence of positive ADAs in the Ximluci group at 
week 24 when compared to the Lucentis arm. During the evaluation, the applicant has provided a 
detailed overview and discussion on the immunogenicity data for both treatment groups up to 52 
weeks. From this additional data there appears to be no notable differences in immunogenicity results 
between the XSB-001 DP and Lucentis groups over time. The potential for immunogenicity was 
observed to be low in the general Xplore study population. The incidence of positive results was low (≤ 
7.5% of patients at any visit in the XSB- 001 DP (Ximluci) group compared with ≤11.9% in the 
Lucentis group).  
At Week 52, the cumulative incidence of positive ADA was 33 subjects (11.3%) in the XSB-001 DP 
(Ximluci) group and 38 subjects (13.1%) in the Lucentis group. The correlation of ADAs to AEs has 
been reported for each treatment group also.  
In conclusion, the overall safety data does not indicate that Ximluci triggers immunogenicity reactions, 
nor causes safety related concerns in a larger extent than Lucentis, hence the currently available data 
indicates that the immunogenicity profiles of the products are comparable. Furthermore, the safety 
profiles (including potential immunogenic events) for ADA-positive subjects treated with Ximluci are 
also comparable to the corresponding safety profile for Lucentis. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There were uncertainties with regard to the maintenance of similarity throughout the treatment period. 
An increase in the difference in change from baseline BCVA between the two treatment arms was seen 
at Week 20 and particularly at Week 24. At Week 24 the LS mean for change from baseline in BCVA was 
5.8 for Ximluci and 8.1 for Lucentis. The LS mean difference was -2.3 with 95% CI -4.0 to -0.6. Further 
data was provided by the Applicant which showed that reduction in BCVA was greater for Lucentis than 
Ximluci at all 4 weekly time points between Week 28 to Week 52 inclusive. However, the differences in 
BCVA observed at Week 24 (-2.27 [95% CI -3.93 to -0.61]) were reduced at Week 52 (-1.46 [95% CI -
3.62 to 0.69]). The Applicant also argued that the results for Ximluci are similar to the results shown in 
a  meta-analysis  of  randomised  controlled  ranibizumab  studies  including  over  3500  patients  from  22 
clinical studiesand that in comparison to historical performance, Lucentis over performed in the Xplore

study (Figure 5). In addition, in terms of change from baseline in sensitive anatomical endpoints such 
as CFT, total size of CNV leakage area, number of intraretinal cysts, amount of sub-retinal fluid and size 
of  retinal  PEDs,  Ximluci  showed  comparability  over  the  whole  52-week  treatment  period.  These 
anatomical endpoints are considered sensitive outcome measures and some of them have been accepted 
as primary endpoint in previous MAs. The data did not show any directional consistency of the effect on 
anatomical endpoints favouring Lucentis.  
Overall, the uncertainties are considered resolved.

baseline BCVA, for wAMD patients. Estimated improvement (dots) and 95% confidence 
intervals (bars) are calculated based on a random effects model from 22 studies and 3613 
patients. Mean change from baseline for Ximluci (Xlucane) and Lucentis based on the Xplore 
study are plotted in red and blue alongside both bar-plots
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Ximluci and Lucentis were judged to be highly similar at the quality level and at Ximluci met its 
primary endpoint at Week 8, a time-point that is likely to be the most sensitive to differences in 
efficacy between the treatment arms.  
Also in light of the assessment of the full 52-week dataset submitted during the application, and of the 
satisfactory manner the uncertainties mentioned above were addressed, biosimilarity can be 
considered demonstrated. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Data on clinical comparability has been provided in one indication, that is, in Patients with Neovascular 
Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Considering that the protein structure for Ximluci is identical to 
ranibizumab, and in vitro binding to VEGF-A receptor isoforms and functional bioactivity were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/795998/2022  
Page 123/125 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable from a non-clinical perspective, safety and efficacy can be extrapolated to all the 
indications applied for.  
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Ximluci is considered biosimilar to Lucentis. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations

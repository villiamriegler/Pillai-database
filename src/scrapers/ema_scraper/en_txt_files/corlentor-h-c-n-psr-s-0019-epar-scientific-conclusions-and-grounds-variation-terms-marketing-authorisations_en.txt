Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report for the non-interventional imposed PASS final study 
report for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The results of this DUS study showed an increase in adherence to the SmPC guidelines in the post-RMM 
period compared to the pre-RMM period. This increase in adherence was measured for all the four criteria 
under study. Therefore, in view of available data regarding the PASS final study report, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the conditions of the marketing authorisation were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

SmPC, Annex 
There are no adequate and well controlled studies of 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.6 of the Eviplera and Odefsey 
SmPCs in order to reflect rilpivirine data from the 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) Interim 
Report issued in December 2019. The Eviplera 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, section 4.6 of the SmPC was updated 
to harmonise the text for breast-feeding with the 
already agreed text for rilpivirine, sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 4.8 of the SmPC regarding the drug-drug 
interaction with didanosine and section 4.8 of the 
SmPC was updated regarding lactic acidosis, as 
agreed by the PRAC in the Viread procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002892/201903. Section 4.5 
was also updated to remove the reference to 
simeprevir. In addition, the Worksharing applicant 
(WSA) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line 
with the latest QRD template version 10.1, make 
II and PL 
Eviplera/Odefsey or their components in pregnant women. 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 
300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative 
or foeto/neonatal toxicity of rilpivirine (see sections 4.4, 
5.1 and 5.2). Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed 
during pregnancy; therefore viral load should be monitored 
closely. A large amount of data on pregnant women (more 
than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative 
nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil. The use of Eviplera/Odefsey may 
be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. 
Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the 
potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, women 
should be instructed not to breast feed if they are receiving 
Eviplera/Odefsey. 
Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir 
disoproxil alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. 
Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with 
decompensated liver disease, or patients receiving 
concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis

worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.9 of the Eviplera and Odefsey 
SmPCs in order to remove the recommendation to 
use oral activated charcoal in the event of an 
overdose of rilpivirine and replace it with a general 
guidance to contact poison control. In addition the 
MAH has taken the opportunity to update the lactose 
wording in Section 4.4 of the SmPC and Section 2 of 
the PL of Eviplera, according to the annex to the EC 
guideline on 'Excipients in the labelling and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use', as well 
as update Section 5.1 of the Eviplera SmPC to reflect 
the full waiver for the Eviplera PIP. The MAH has also 
updated to remove the mention of administration of 
activated charcoal to aid in the removal of unabsorbed 
rilpivirine hydrochloride, replaced by advice that further 
management of rilpivirine overdose should be as clinically 
indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC for 
Viread, Truvada and Stribild and Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC for Eviplera in order to add the results from 
study Study GS-US-367-1657, listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP; this is a Phase 1 Multiple Dose 
Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug 
Interaction Potential between 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir Fixed-Dose 
Combination and HIV Antiretroviral in Healthy 
Subjects.  
The corresponding section 2 of the Package Leaflet 
for Viread, Truvada and Stribild has been updated.  
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took 
the opportunity to implement minor linguistic 
amendments (MLAs) to the following translations: 
-Viread: CZ, DA, DE, ES, FI, FR, HR, HU, IS, LV, MT,

Furthermore, the WSA took the opportunity to align 
administration of tenofovir disoproxil with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir  and darunavir/ritonavir 
increases plasma concentrations of tenofovir  and may lead 
to adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. 
The combination of tenofovir disoproxil containing products 
(Viread, Truvada, Eviplera, Stribild) and 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir should be used with 
caution and frequently renally monitored.

pharmacovigilance activity in the Risk Management 
Plan for both the Eviplera and Odefsey. This is a 
single-arm, open-label study to assess the 
2nd and 3rd trimesters, and postpartum. The 
pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that total exposure 
(AUC) to rilpivirine as a part of an antiretroviral regimen 
was approximately 30% lower during pregnancy compared 
with postpartum (6-12 weeks). 
The virologic response was generally preserved throughout 
the study: of the 12 patients that completed the study, 10

patients were suppressed at the end of the study; in the 
other 2 patients an increase in viral load was observed only 
postpartum, for at least 1 patient due to suspected 
suboptimal adherence.   
No mother to child transmission occurred in all 10 infants 
born to the mothers who completed the trial and for whom 
the HIV status was available. Rilpivirine was well tolerated 
during pregnancy and postpartum. There were no new 
safety findings compared with the known safety profile of 
rilpivirine in HIV 1 infected adults. In the Phase 3 studies 
(C209 and C215), lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that 
seen during pregnancy, has been associated with an 
increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load 
should be monitored closely. Alternatively, switching to 
another antiretroviral regimen could be considered.

14/09/2017

SmPC and PL 
The results from the study TMC435-TiDP16-C114 showed 
Interaction information for Eviplera based on the 
results from Study TMC435-TiDP16-C114; this is a 
Phase I, 2-panel, open-label, randomized, cross-over 
trial in healthy subjects to investigate the 
pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC435 and 
antiretroviral agents, TMC278 and tenofovir 
that coadministration of Simeprevir with Rilpivirine or 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not lead to a clinically 
relevant pharmacokinetic interaction and no new safety 
findings were observed compared to the known adverse 
reactions associated with either product. No dose 
adjustment is therefore required regarding the 
Page 9/36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), at steady-state. 
In addition, the drug-drug interaction information for 
telaprevir (also an HCV NS3/4A inhibitor) is removed 
from the Eviplera prescribing information due to the 
withdrawal of the telaprevir marketing authorisation 
in the EU. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took 
the opportunity to introduce minor administrative 
changes in the SmPC and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet for Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania. 
Minor linguistic amendments (MLAs) have been

Updates of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC for the 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing 
products (Viread, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild) which 
includes the results from Study GS-US-342-1167 and

antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January

exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently 
updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 
BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient 
with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent 
transmission should be taken in accordance with national 
guidelines.

Rilpivirine has been shown to inhibit OCT2 in vitro. At the 
time of the study set up, no information on the effect of 
rilpivirine on MATE transporters was known. The current 
study was designed to assess the effect of steady-state 
rilpivirine on OCT2 in vivo, by evaluating its effect on the

healthy adult subjects. 
The study showed that rilpivirine had no effect on the 
plasma pharmacokinetics of metformin and its urine

this finding are currently unknown.  
In addition the interactions section of the SmPC was 
further amended to better reflect information on 
rifapentine in the interactions table and for 
consistency a sentence was added to inform 
prescribers that rilpivirine should not be administered 
concomitantly with rilpivirine hydrochloride unless 
needed for dose adjustment with rifabutin. 
Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity of this 
variation to include administrative corrections to

finding that under rifabutin treatment rilpivirine can 
be used concomitantly (previously contraindicated) if 
an additional dose of 25 mg rilpivirine is taken. The

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

requested at the time of the Marketing Authorisation, 
showed that after administration rifabutin 300 mg q.d. and 
25 mg q.d. rilpivirine, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin for 
rilprivirine decreased by 42, 31 and 48%, respectively 
while an increase in the rilpivirine dose to 50 mg q.d. lead 
to an increase of rilpivirine AUC and Cmax of about 16 and 
42%, while Cmin decreased 7%. The observed differences, 
compared to a 25 mg q.d. dose of rilpivirine, were 
considered safe and efficacious and it was considered that a 
rilpivirine dose of 50 mg q.d could compensate for the 
inducing effect of rifabutin.  
The CHMP therefore agreed that the contraindication for 
coadministration of Eviplera with rifabutin could be replaced 
with a warning in SmPC section 4.4 and instructions in 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.5 stating that when Eviplera is co-
administered with rifabutin, an additional 25 mg tablet of 
rilpivirine per day is recommended to be taken

digoxin (study TMC278IFD1001). Section 4.5 of the

concentration (IC50) value of 3.4 μg/ml. While rilpivirine 
plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers and in HIV-1 
infected patients are below this level, theoretically the 
intestinal concentration of rilpivirine after administration of 
a 25 mg oral dose could be up to 100 μg/ml. Therefore 
rilpivirine could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of P-
gp substrates. 
The results from study TMC278IFD1001 demonstrated that 
the pharmacokinetics of the P-gp substrate digoxin is not 
affected by rilpivirine, administered at the recommended 
25 mg daily dose. This was further substantiated by urinary 
excretion data. However, the CHMP noted that digoxin is 
not very sensitive to inhibition of intestinal P-gp, thus it 
cannot be concluded that there is no effect of rilpivirine on 
more sensitive substrates of intestinal P-gp, such as 
dabigatran etexilate. This information was included in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC, and the reference to 
troleandomycin was deleted as this product is no longer 
marketed in the EU.

currently submitted phase I study in healthy volunteers. 
Including the results of all subjects, the data showed that 
rilpivirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 78, 49 and 93%, 
respectively due to co-administration of telaprevir 750 mg

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Rituximab was first authorised in the European Union on 2 June 1998 under the name of MabThera. It 
is also marketed under the name Rituxan in the United States (US). It is currently approved for the 
following indications:  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
 
treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination 
with chemotherapy. 
  maintenance therapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction 
therapy. 
  monotherapy for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo-
resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
 
treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 
combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
 
in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and 
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
 
in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
inhibitor therapies. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis 
 
in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult patients with 
severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA). 
The conditions covered by the above indications have been extensively analysed through the 
respective approval procedures of Mabthera (see Mabthera European assessment report – EPAR) 
Riximyo contains rituximab intended to be approved in all the above indications with the exception of 
the CLL and retreatment after 24 weeks in Rheumatoid arthritis on the basis of its claimed biosimilarity 
to Mabthera. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
According to the prevalence of the indications Non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (1-5 / 10000) and 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (1-9 / 100000) are rare 
conditions. The more common condition, rheumatoid arthritis, has a prevalence of more than 1 in 
1000. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 10/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a form of malignant lymphoma distinguished from Hodgkin's 
disease only by the absence of binucleate giant cells. Follicular lymphomas are indolent (slow-growing) 
NHL and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas overall, defined as a lymphoma 
of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at least a partially follicular pattern. 
It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD22, and usually CD20, but almost always negative 
for CD5.  
B-cells also play several important roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). They produce auto-
antibodies such as Rheumatoid Factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) antibody in RA 
or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in MPA and CPA. In the synovium, RF immune 
complexes may mediate complement activation and the propagation of the inflammatory cascade. B-
cells present in the RA synovial membrane may secrete a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, some 
of which are components in the process leading to joint inflammation and damage, or to induce 
leukocyte infiltration. B-cells can function as antigen-presenting cells and immune-regulatory cells, 
leading to T-cell activation. They can also stimulate osteoclasts and synovial fibroblasts and lead to 
bone erosions and joint tissue remodelling. 
Peripheral B cell counts decline below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In 
patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of 
treatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, 
although in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-
induction therapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral 
blood was observed following two infusions of 1000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day interval. 
Peripheral blood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation is 
observed in the majority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was administered as 
monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged 
peripheral B cell depletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells 
decreased to <10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that 
level in most patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of 
B cell return, with counts >10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Clinical presentation of the conditions covered by rituximab as well as diagnostic methods available 
have been extensively described in the individual applications throughout the history of the originator 
rituximab (Mabthera) in the EU (see Mabthera EPAR). 
About the product 
Rituximab is a chimeric human-murine immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, located on pre-B 
and mature B lymphocytes. CD20 is located on pre-B and mature B-cells, but not on haematopoietic 
stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal cells. CD20 is also expressed on >95% of 
all B-cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This antigen does not internalise upon antibody binding and is 
not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen and, thus, does

not compete for antibody binding. CD20 regulates an early step in the activation process for cell cycle 
initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. After binding to the CD20 
antigen on the cell surface, rituximab exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting B-cell lysis. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for marketing authorisation of Riximyo, (also referred 
to as GP2013), rituximab concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion of 100 mg and 500 mg, as a 
biosimilar  product  to  the  European  reference  product  MabThera  (EMA  registration  numbers 
EU/1/98/067/001-002).  
MabThera has been registered for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphatic 
leukaemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Mabthera was first authorised in the European Union in 1998.  
Marketing authorisation has not been requested for solution(s) for subcutaneous injection for Riximyo 
compared to the European reference product. 
The global development program for Riximyo was designed in a stepwise approach for demonstrating 
comparability between Riximyo and the EU Reference Product MabThera. As a first step, structural and 
functional characterisation of Riximyo and the reference product was established. Riximyo was 
developed using the principles of a quality by design approach. A comprehensive set of binding and 
activity assays were conducted to gain understanding of the functionalities, and the structures 
underlying these functionalities of the molecule, that contribute to its modes of action.  
The second step involved non-clinical testing including pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
and toxicokinetics studies. In addition, studies in mouse xenograft tumour disease models were 
conducted using a dose scaling design. Finally, assessment of effector mechanisms such as ADCC, 
CDC, and apoptosis was performed in a healthy volunteer whole blood assay, and in ADCC potency 
assays with different in vitro settings. 
Confirmation of comparability between  Riximyo and MabThera at the clinical level was based on two 
randomised trials: one study in patients with RA (Study GP13-201), and one study in patients with 
advanced Follicular Lymphoma (study GP13-301). The primary objective of Study GP13-201 was 
establishing bioequivalence of PK; the primary objective of Study GP13-301 was the confirmation of 
therapeutic equivalence. As supportive evidence, PK-PD data were provided from a small-scaled 
observational study in Japanese patients with indolent NHL.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the active substance contained in Riximyo is 
rituximab. It is a murine/human chimeric IgG1 kappa type monoclonal antibody directed against the 
CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. This chimeric anti-CD20 
antibody is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) mammalian 
cell expression system. It has the characteristics which are common in monoclonal antibodies and 
include amino acid modifications such as deamidation, oxidation or glycation, disulfide bridging, 
variable N-glycosylation, N- and C-terminal heterogeneity, and molecular weight variants.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) by 
Sandoz GmbH Schaftenau, Austria. The manufacturing process reflects a standard process used for the 
manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. The active substance is produced in a fed-batch process. The 
cell culture process involves three stages: the seed train, the inoculum train, and the production 
culture. The purification process consists of consecutive operations including primary separation; 
several chromatography steps; viral inactivation/filtration and UF/DF. Description of the active 
substance manufacturing process is considered adequate. 
Process characterization was conducted in accordance with current ICH requirements including quality 
by design (QbD) principles. Process characterization included large scale and small scale data mining, 
risk assessments, and laboratory studies. A process risk assessment tool based on failure mode and 
effects analysis (FMEA) methodology was used to assess the process- and product-related risks of the 
active substance manufacturing process and to select the process parameters (PPs) which should be 
further investigated during process characterisation (PC) studies. The classification of PP is 
appropriate. 
Control of materials 
As the active substance has been developed as biosimilar, the coding sequence of the expression gene 
was designed to achieve the identical primary amino acid sequence as the reference product.  
Cell bank testing and characterisation was performed according to the requirements defined in ICH 
Q5A and Q5D. The data of cell bank characterisation demonstrate the absence of microbial and viral 
contaminants, as well as endogenously encoded retrovirus-like particles. Protocols for the preparation 
and testing of future Working Cell Banks are in place to ensure consistent supply. 
In the manufacturing process of the active substance no material of human or TSE relevant species is 
used. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
An extensive control strategy is proposed. Process controls performed during manufacture of the active 
substance are categorized. 
Process validation 
Process validation at commercial scale was performed and process and performance parameters have 
been maintained within the specified acceptance ranges. Results of IPCs complied with the pre-defined 
limits. The release data for the three consecutive process validation batches comply with the 
specifications. Process-related impurities are effectively removed by the purification process. Data from 
manufacturing scale and results from spiking studies at small scale show that process related 
impurities are reduced to concentrations below the acceptable limit, which is based on worst case 
considerations taking a maximum intravenous dose of 1,000 mg per day into account. The removal of 
product related impurities was demonstrated. Overall the data show that the process is under control 
and suitable for consistent manufacturing. A small scale study showed that the reuse of the 
chromatography resins has no adverse effects on process performance and product quality including 
product and process related impurities and adventitious agents. Based on the results of the small scale 
study, the maximum number of cycles of the chromatography resins was defined. The results are 
supported by concurrent manufacturing scale validation activities. Hold times were established and are 
considered validated.

Manufacturing process development 
In the first development phase a downstream process suitable for manufacturing of AS for preclinical 
and clinical studies was successfully developed. During the second development phase the downstream 
process was further improved. The comparability data demonstrate that the derived material is 
comparable to the reference material. 
Characterisation 
For the characterisation of Riximyo a comprehensive series of analytical methods have been used. 
These methods included state-of the art sensitive and orthogonal physicochemical and biological tests 
to determine the primary, secondary, and higher-order structure, post-translational modifications and 
associated heterogeneities, glycosylation, charge variants, purity/impurities, and quantity of Riximyo. 
Molecular Mass and Primary Structure: the active substance is a 145 kDa monoclonal antibody 
composed of two light chains (213 amino acid) and two heavy chains (451 amino acid), which are N-
glycosylated at Asn 301. Based on its theoretical sequence and characterisation studies, peptide 
mapping confirmed that the active substance had the expected primary structure and it can be stated 
that the sequence of the active substance is identical to the theoretical sequence of rituximab. In 
addition mass spectrometry analyses showed that all test items had the expected masses. 
Disulfide bridging: All disulfide linkages could be confirmed by peptide mapping and x-ray 
crystallography. The levels of free thiols were comparable in all test items. 
N-Glycosylation: Analyses of oligosaccharides showed that the active substance had consistent 
oligosaccharide distribution and expected glycosylation for an antibody produced in CHO cells, showing 
one single N-glycosylation site at the heavy chains (Asn301). No potentially immunogenic glycoforms 
such as NGNA or Gal-α1,3-Gal could be identified. 
Charged variants: Charge heterogeneity was evaluated for all test items and revealed consistent 
values for acidic and basic peak variants, the amount of glycated variants as well as for sialylated 
structures.  
Molecular size variants: Size heterogeneity was assessed by capillary gel electrophoresis, SEC, SEC-
MALLS, AUC, AF4, MFI, light obscuration and visible particles determination according to Ph. Eur. The 
results show that all variants detected were of proteinous nature. 
Higher order structure: Structural analyses of the active substance showed that all test items had 
identical higher order structures. 
Biological function: Rituximab has a number of elements that are known to contribute to its mode of 
action. After binding of the CD20 antigen on the surface of B cells, the complement system is activated 
via binding of C1q to the Fc part of the antibody, leading to complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
In addition, the antibody can interact with FcR positive cells and can thereby induce antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Furthermore, binding of rituximab can induce apoptosis of the 
target cell. All elements of these modes of action were tested using different types of assays: CD20 
binding activity (binding assay), FcRn (SPR), FcγRIa (SPR), FcγRIIa (SPR), FcγRIIb (SPR), FcγRIIIa 
(F158) (SPR), FcγRIIIa (V158) (SPR), FcγRIIIb (SPR), ADCC activity (ADCC assay), CDC activity (CDC 
assay, C1q binding (C1q binding assay) and apoptosis induction (apoptosis assay). All assays revealed 
consistent results for the active substance tests with all values within the specified and expected 
ranges. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 15/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The evaluated data confirmed the capability of the active substance manufacturing process to produce 
consistent batches. The results obtained showed that the active substance has the expected primary, 
secondary and tertiary structures and physicochemical properties of a human IgG1 type antibody and 
all biological characteristics revealed no result being out of the specified or defined target range. 
The active substance specification includes test methods for clarity, coloration, pH, identity, purity, 
glycosylation profile, bioburden, endotoxins, content and biological activity (potency). 
Characterisation is additionally discussed in the context of biosimilarity to the reference product. 
Specification 
The specifications set for the release of the active substance have been set taking ICH Q6B guideline 
into account.  
Clearance validation studies have been performed to demonstrate that the manufacturing process 
provides adequate clearance of impurities. Process-related impurities are extensively identified and 
assessed. The batch results indicate that levels of process-related impurities are consistently low 
among the AS batches. Product-related impurities have been adequately defined and are also 
discussed as part of the biosimilarity data. Sufficient information is provided to substantiate that the 
CPPs/CIPCs guarantee satisfactory impurity removal over the whole range of the associated PARs.  
Analytical methods 
General tests (Clarity, Colour, and pH) and Safety tests (Endotoxin and microbial enumeration) are 
performed according to the Ph. Eur. monographs. Non-compendial methods are briefly described 
including preparation, procedure, system suitability and assay acceptance criteria. The analytical 
methods are appropriately validated. 
Batch analysis 
The batch results of the currently available AS batches manufactured with the proposed commercial 
process at the GMP manufacturing facility at Sandoz GmbH Schaftenau, Austria indicates that the 
manufacturing process is robust. All acceptance criteria were met. In order to establish the acceptance 
criteria for the commercial specifications, batch data were evaluated. Statistical analysis of the batch 
results has been also performed for the quantitative release tests to confirm that the proposed 
commercial specifications reflect assay variability, future process variability and capability 
appropriately. 
Reference materials 
For active substance reference material a two-tiered approach, including primary in-house reference 
material and working standards, has been used. The working standards are designated to be released 
compared to the primary in-house standard, which should thereby last for a longer period of time. 
Stability 
A comprehensive stability program has been provided. Results on long-term storage conditions have 
been provided and are considered sufficient to justify the proposed shelf-life. Evaluation of the results 
of the stability of the active substance at 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH showed that the selected parameters 
are stability indicating and appropriate to demonstrate stability of the product. A follow up stability 
program is proposed covering long-term storage conditions. The analytical methods cover stability 
indicating (including potency) and safety parameters. A photo-stability study revealed only minor 
effects on the purity of the active substance. Freeze-thawing and freeze-freezing studies demonstrated 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017

the active substance stability for several cycles of alternating freezing at long-term and intermediate 
frozen storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous (IV) use after 
dilution. The liquid formulation is based on rituximab as the active substance at a concentration of 10 
mg/mL provided in 10 mL vials (100 mg) and 50 mL vials (500 mg). The excipients for the formulation 
are compliant with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. and commonly used in parenteral medicinal 
products. The applicant sufficiently described the pharmaceutical development of the finished product 
(FP).  
The process characterization included data mining, risk assessment, laboratory studies and technical 
batches manufactured at commercial scale. A process risk assessment tool based on FMEA 
methodology was used to assess the process-related risks of the FP manufacturing processes and to 
select the process parameters for characterization studies.  
During development the manufacturing process of the FP has been changed. Initially the FP has been 
produced at the first biopharmaceuticals manufacturing site. The process was afterwards transferred to 
the commercial manufacturing site. Comprehensive studies have been performed to investigate the 
comparability of the finished product manufactured. The results showed comparable FP as all 
comparability assessment criteria have been met.  
The primary container closure consist of a type I glass vial and a chlorobotyl rubber stopper. Both 
components meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur. The vials are crimped with an aluminium cap with a 
flip-off component. The compatibility of all constituents of the finished product with the container 
closure system was sufficiently demonstrated by stability data of numerous batches. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). It is 
released by Sandoz GmbH Schaftenau, Austria... The finished product is produced using standard 
manufacturing steps such as thawing of the AS, dissolving of excipients, compounding, sterile filtration 
and aseptic vial filling. Sterile filtration by means of bacteria-retentive membrane filters followed by 
aseptic filling is applied. 
The process is sufficiently described including details on stirring, filtration and filling. Additionally, an 
overview of process parameters and their target values/acceptable ranges is provided. 
The established in-process controls (IPCs) are considered as appropriate tests to monitor the process 
and assure a consistent performance of the manufacture of the FP. Classification of process parameters 
(PPs) was performed taking into account the existing product, process knowledge, and experimental 
data. Considering that the finished product manufacturing process is straightforward, the proposed 
IPCs, PPs and their ranges are acceptable. Validation of the manufacturing process was executed as 
prospective validation for the 100 mg and 500 mg strengths of the finished product. Process validation 
data / process qualification data demonstrate that when producing within the process conditions set, 
the predefined IPCs and product specifications are met. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 17/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The control strategy describes how QAs are addressed through different control elements. It provides a 
link between the finished product quality and the control elements that are established to ensure 
process robustness and product quality.  
Subsequent to successful process validation, process performance and product quality are monitored 
as part of the continued process verification (CPV) to ensure that the state of control is maintained 
throughout the commercial manufacturing process. Continued process verification is a planned life-
cycle management program to ensure that the manufacturing process remains capable and is in a 
state of control. This is achieved through the systematic collection, analysis and trending of product-
related and process-related data. 
Product specification  
The specifications for the release of the finished product have been set taking the principles of the 
guideline ICH Q6B into account.  The finished product specification includes test methods for 
coloration, clarity, pH, extractable volume, osmolality, identity, purity, sterility, endotoxins, visible and 
sub-visible particles content and biological activity (potency). 
Justification is presented in support of the proposed set of the finished product release / shelf life tests 
and their acceptance criteria.  
Analytical methods specific for the FP are briefly described. For compendial methods, the applicant 
refers to the corresponding Ph. Eur. monographs. For methods (including validation) identical for the 
AS testing the applicant refers to the corresponding AS sections. The suitability of compendial methods 
was verified for their use. The validation of the tests was adequately completed. . Batch analyses data 
is provided for laboratory scale, pilot scale and commercial scale batches, confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Each 
batch was tested to the specification in place at the time of manufacture and all specifications were 
met. For the finished product the same reference materials are used as for the active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The applicant provided a comprehensive stability program including long-term, accelerated, stress 
conditions as well as freeze / thaw, out-of-the fridge, inverse out-of-the fridge and photostress studies. 
The stability protocols, including the selected QAs to be tested and time points for sampling, are 
acceptable and in accordance with ICH Q5C. For the long-term storage conditions, data were evaluated 
statistically using ANOCOVA for all stability-indicating parameters and a theoretical shelf-life according 
to ICH guideline Q1E was calculated where applicable. 
The stability batches encompassed both strengths 100 mg and 500 mg. Data up to 36 months at long-
term conditions have been presented for batches. 
For most of the quality attributes tested the results show a highly stable finished product at the 
recommended long-term stability conditions (5 ± 3°C). Importantly, all results of the tested finished 
product 100 mg and 500 mg batches were within the shelf-life specifications during storage at 5 ± 
3°C.  
Evaluation of the results of the stability of the finished product at accelerated (25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% 
RH) and stressed (40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH ) conditions showed highly comparable degradation 
profiles.  
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 18/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In-use stability study 
The in-use study performed with the finished product diluted in 0.9% NaCl and 5% Glucose and stored 
in PE bags revealed no changes for the biophysical stabilities of the FP after in-use storage under 
different storage conditions.  
The results of the freeze / thaw studies did not reveal a significant impact on the quality attributes of 
the FP. Furthermore, the FP has been shown to remain stable at recommended conditions for up to 36 
months after initial storage at room temperature for up to 14 days (out-of-the fridge study). The 
inverse out-of-the fridge study (14 days at room temperature after 36 months storage at 
recommended conditions) showed slight differences in the charged variants. The results stayed within 
the defined acceptance criteria. The results of the photostress study demonstrated that illumination 
slightly induces degradation in the FP. 
Adventitious agents 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The 
active drug substance of Riximyo is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No TSE relevant 
material is added during cell cultivation of the active substance. The MCB and WCB which have been 
established are free from TSE-risk substances. 
The active substance is expressed in CHO cell using serum-free medium. The cell banking system has 
been extensively screened for adventitious viruses using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. The 
tests demonstrated the absence of any virus contaminants in the cell banks with the exception of 
intracellular type A and extracellular type C retrovirus-like particles which are well known to be present 
in rodent cells; this is acceptable as there is sufficient capacity within the active substance 
manufacturing process to inactivate/remove such virus particles. . Both enveloped and non-enveloped 
viruses were effectively reduced by the various unit operations including inactivation at low pH, 
chromatography steps and a virus filtration step. Chromatography resins are re-used during the active 
substance manufacturing process and both new and used resins have been investigated with very 
similar performance with respect to virus reduction. At the end of the active substance cell culture 
procedure, general testing for adventitious viruses is performed and a cell line is included to detect 
minute virus of mice. 
Biosimilarity 
The overall strategy to demonstrate biosimilarity between Riximyo and MabThera, the EU authorised 
reference product, was designed in a stepwise approach: demonstrating analytical comparability 
between the biosimilar, the reference product (MabThera) and the US authorised Rituxan; and by 
generating non-clinical and clinical data. 
As a first step, in an extensive structural and functional characterization, analytical comparability 
between the biosimilar and the reference product was established. A comprehensive set of binding and 
activity assays were conducted to gain a full understanding of all functionalities of the molecule and 
the structures underlying these functionalities that contribute to its MoAs, demonstrating that the 
active substance and the finished product batches of the biosimilar and MabThera/Rituxan batches are 
comparable on physicochemical and biological level. A sufficiently high number of the biosimilar 
batches manufactured by the commercial process as well as of the MabThera reference product 
authorised in the EU was included in the analytical similarity exercise. 
The second step involved non-clinical testing confirming the comparability of the biosimilar and 
MabThera/Rituxan.  
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 19/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, clinical comparability was based on two pivotal studies. 
In order to define a biosimilarity range for the biosimilar, the applicant comprehensively analysed both 
the EU reference product and US Rituxan using orthogonal methods analysing specific quality 
attributes. The results showed high comparability between both products. Different batches of the EU 
reference product and Rituxan were continuously monitored to verify batch to batch consistency and 
showed no differences between them. This monitoring assessed the variability of the reference product 
over a period of approximately 9 years. A quality shift was observed in 2008 for the EU reference 
product and US Rituxan. Several quality attributes were affected (e.g. charge variants, glycan 
structures, ADCC) by this shift but both qualities were on the market simultaneously, therefore both 
quality profiles observed for the reference product are considered to represent a safe and effective 
product and considered appropriate for use in comparability assessment.  
The primary structure of the biosimilar is identical to the primary structure of the reference product. 
Using different endoproteinases and combinations of endoproteinases with distinct substrate specificity 
and subsequent LC-ESIMS and MS/MS analyses 100% coverage of the amino acid sequences of the 
biosimilar and the reference product was achieved. Considering also the molecular mass analyses, the 
amino acid sequences are considered identical. In addition to X-ray crystallography, native LysC 
peptide mapping using RP-HPLC UV/MS revealed a similar disulphide bridge pattern in the biosimilar 
and the EU reference product. Analysis of the free thiols for the biosimilar was within the range of 
variability of the EU reference product. Post-translational modifications (PTM) as N-terminal 
pyroglutamate, C-terminal lysine variants and proline amide were identified in the biosimilar as well as 
in the EU reference product, with slight higher values for proline amide in the biosimilar. However, the 
small difference seen in the value of proline amide is scientifically justified to not compromise 
biosimilarity. Furthermore, PTMs as methionine oxidation, asparagine deamidation with or without 
subsequent isomerization were analysed by mass spectrometry using batches stored under stress 
conditions and identified identical locations on the antibodies for these PTMs in both the biosimilar and 
the reference product.  
The higher order structure of the biosimilar and the reference product has been elucidated using 
orthogonal state-of the art assays. The results show highly comparable structures in terms of the 
secondary and tertiary structure conformation. Furthermore x-ray crystallographic analyses 
demonstrated similar Fab- and Fc-fragments as well as similar disulfide bridges within the fragments of 
the biosimilar and the reference product. Thermograms showed comparable unfolding of both mAbs 
further demonstrating their biosimilarity. 
The elucidation of molecular size variants showed that the biosimilar has a comparable purity to the 
reference product. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results suggest a slightly higher purity, 
whereas orthogonal methods as analytical ultracentrifugation and SEC-MALLS show comparable 
purities. Furthermore, in terms of the hydrodynamic diameter or polydispersity both the biosimilar and 
the reference product show similar results. In addition, the enumeration of sub-visible particles 
measured by resonant mass measurement and micro-flow imaging demonstrated comparable results 
considering the high variability of these methods. Taken together the data on molecular size variants 
justifies a biosimilarity claim of the biosimilar to its reference product. 
The pattern of charged variants is distinctive for biotechnologically manufactured mAbs. Using cation 
exchange chromatography, the biosimilar pattern could be resolved into acidic, main, and basic 
variants. The basic variants were identified to contain C-terminal lysine, proline amidation as well as N-
terminal glutamine. The values lie within the upper range of the reference product. Acidic variants 
representing mainly molecule fragments, deamidation, glycation, and pyroglutamate are lower in the 
biosimilar compared to the reference product. Further analysis of the different fractions of the CEX 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 20/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chromatogram (of the biosimilar and the reference product) showed that all fractions that were 
manageable to purify showed comparable potency values. The glycation, which has been shown to 
impact the potency of certain mAbs, showed a lower value for the biosimilar in comparison to its 
reference product. Further in depth analysis of the biosimilar and the reference product with 
intentionally increased glycation values did not reveal negative effects on efficacy. As the overall 
values are very low and the effects on efficacy and safety minor they are considered to not question 
the biosimilarity of the biosimilar and its reference product. 
The comparison of the glycosylation pattern of the biosimilar and the reference product shows minor 
differences. The main glycan structures identified in rituximab are bG0, bG1 and bG2, which showed 
comparable values in the biosimilar and the reference product. Afucosylated structures, as well as high 
mannose sugars have been shown to influence Fc-mediated effector functions such as ADCC. 
Compared to the reference product, the glycan profile cumulates to comparable ADCC activity of the 
biosimilar and the reference product and, taking also the overall low content of these structures into 
account, no impact on efficacy/safety is expected.  
The biological functions have been directly analyzed using bioassays for ADCC, CDC and Apoptosis 
induction or by measuring the binding of the Fc-part to the responsible receptors Fcγ-receptors for 
ADCC and C1q for CDC. A comparative stability study was performed for the biosimilar, the EU 
reference product, and US marketed Rituxan, to assess the stability under long-term, accelerated and 
stress conditions. The results of the studies show no significant differences in the degradation profiles 
of the biosimilar and the reference product. 
During the comparability exercise small differences (high mannose structures, differences in charged 
variants) have been found between the biosimilar and the reference product. To provide further 
assurance that these differences in high mannose structures and charged variants do not affect 
biosimilarity or potency, in-depth analyses as well as forced degradation studies have been performed. 
The biosimilar and the reference product have been stored under stress conditions  to foster 
degradation, and subsequently fractionated. The potency of these fractions has been analysed  and a 
comparison between the biosimilar and the reference product was made. The results demonstrated 
that the biosimilar and the reference product behave similarly under stressed conditions, including the 
potency of the fractions. Fragments of the biosimilar have been demonstrated, as expected, to be 
biologically inactive and are defined as impurities. It was demonstrated that the amounts of fragments 
in the biosimilar and the reference product are comparable. Furthermore, process-related impurities as 
host cell DNA and protein that affect the safety evaluation of the medicinal products have been found 
to be comparably low for both products. 
Summarising, a sufficiently high number of the biosimilar batches manufactured by the commercial 
process as well as of the MabThera reference product authorised in the EU was included in the 
analytical similarity exercise. As the US authorised Rituxan has been used in addition to the reference 
product for pre-clinical studies, investigation of Rituxan batches were also included in the analytical 
similarity exercise and it can be concluded that bridging between the US comparator and the EU 
reference product is acceptable. 
Based on the comprehensive analytical comparability exercise, similarity between Riximyo and the 
reference medicinal product is considered demonstrated on quality level. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant provided a well-structured quality dossier. In general, high quality scientific data have 
been presented.

The manufacturing process reflects a standard process used for the manufacture of monoclonal 
antibodies and is well described, characterized and validated. The CQA assessment based on the in-
house risk assessment tool is considered acceptable. The manufacturing process and associated control 
strategy are based on a structured process development strategy; ICH Q8 elements (e.g. risk 
assessment tools for identification of CQAs; systematic definition of a control strategy) have been 
appropriately incorporated. The data package comprises both full scale and small scale process 
characterisation and validation studies; in addition full scale PPQ (verification) batches are available; 
column/resin life time studies are addressed using continuous process verification elements. For the 
characterization, a comprehensive series of analytical methods have been used. These methods 
included state-of the art sensitive and orthogonal physicochemical and biological tests to determine the 
primary, secondary, and higher-order structure, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and associated 
heterogeneities, glycosylation, charge variants, purity/impurities, and quantity of Riximyo. The control 
of the AS and FP is considered sufficient.  
The TSE virus safety of the finished product has been sufficiently demonstrated. Riximyo has been 
developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the European Union (EU)-authorised reference 
product MabThera (rituximab). Overall the analytical comparability data suggest that Riximyo can be 
considered biosimilar to the reference product. The applicant performed an extensive and structured 
comparability exercise in order to demonstrate analytical comparability and justify biosimilarity. This 
comparability exercise is supported by a risk based CQA assessment, in order to rank the attributes 
and assess the impact if ranges do not overlap. The comparability exercise includes different batches 
of reference product, and batches of the biosimilar. Most tests directly support analytical comparability, 
because ranges of the biosimilar are within the ranges for the reference product. In a number of cases, 
it is justified that ranges do not overlap because the biosimilar contains less product-related 
substances/impurities (e.g. aggregates).  
In summary, from a quality perspective, it is considered that similarity between Riximyo and the 
reference product was shown. Minor differences were identified, which are not considered to impact 
efficacy and safety of the product nor preclude biosimilarity. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. Based on the comprehensive analytical 
comparability exercise, similarity between Riximyo and the reference medicinal product is considered 
demonstrated on quality level. As the US authorised Rituxan has been used in addition to the reference 
product for pre-clinical studies, investigation of Rituxan batches were also included in the analytical 
similarity exercise and it can be concluded that bridging between the US comparator and the EU 
reference product is acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
It is recommended that the active substance and finished product specifications will be re-evaluated 
after an appropriate and agreed number of batches becomes available using statistical tools, as

already committed by the applicant.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical animal studies included a series of studies to characterize and compare the non-clinical 
pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety profiles of Riximyo and MabThera 
including two pivotal GLP studies. The Applicant also submitted data from studies in two xenografted 
tumour models in mice.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Rituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein 
expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes, but not on hematopoietic stem cells and 
terminally differentiated antibody-producing plasma cells, or other tissues. While the Fab domain of 
rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, the Fc domain can recruit immune effector 
functions to mediate B cell lysis (resulting in B cell depletion), as well as modulating exposure. The 
ascribed mechanisms of effector-mediated cell lysis include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC); Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Apoptosis and Macrophage-mediated antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) – Figure 1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 23/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rituximab coated B cells are killed by at least 4 different mechanisms. (A) Binding of rituximab to CD20 on 
B  cell  surface  causes  activation  of  the  complement  cascade,  which  generates  the  membrane  attack 
complex  (MAC)  that  can  directly  induce  B-cell  lysis  by  complement-mediated  cytotoxicity  (CDC).  (B) 
Binding of rituximab allows interaction with NK cells via Fc receptors III (FcRIII), which leads to antibody-
dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  (C)  The  Fc  portion  of  rituximab  and  the  deposited 
complement  fragments  allow  for  recognition  by  both  FcR  and  complement  receptors  on  macrophages, 
which lead to phagocytosis and ADCC. (D) The crosslinking of several molecules of rituximab and CD20 in 
the lipid raft determine the interaction of these complexes with elements of a signaling pathway involving 
Src kinases that mediate direct apoptosis (From Jaglowski et al 2010). 
Figure 1 - Mechanisms of rituximab-mediated cell death. 
In vitro pharmacodynamic studies 
In an ex vivo whole blood depletion assay (study GP13-021), collected human whole blood is incubated 
ex vivo with different concentrations ofRiximyo. After incubation, during which concentration-
dependent B cell depletion occurs, distinct subsets of blood cells are stained with fluorescence-labelled 
detection antibodies and analysed on a flow cytometer. The concentration-dependent decrease of B 
cells within the lymphocyte populations is determined. Relative B cell depletion (BCD) is calculated. In 
this assay, Riximyo was shown to be similar to Rituxan and MabThera in its ability to deplete B cells, 
with all tested batch samples of Riximyo displaying similar biological activity at equivalent 
concentrations. 
Study GP13-017 compared Riximyo and MabThera for in vitro ADCC potency of freshly-isolated human 
peripheral blood NK cells as the effector cells against different immortalized B cell lines and the overall 
results indicated that Riximyo and MabThera were similar in their ability to mediate ADCC in these cell 
lines. The results from study GP13-022, which was an extension of GP13-017 using one B cell line, 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 24/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicated a comparable range of EC50 values (relative to a reference standard) for MabThera and 
Riximyo. 
The Applicant also assessed the depletion of a B cell line by Riximyo, MabThera, and Rituxan mediated 
by freshly isolated human PBMC. This dataset, albeit limited, confirmed comparable activity of Riximyo 
and the reference medicinal product. 
 In vivo pharmacodynamic studies 
The pharmacodynamic effects of Rixiymo and MabThera were compared in Cynomolgus monkeys. After 
single dose iv administration of 5 mg/kg, the AUEC ratio was similar for the first 7 days, but when the 
whole 28 days observation period was compared the effect of Riximyo was slightly less than of 
Mabthera (AUEC ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.98) for the CD20low B-cells, which are considered more 
close to human CD20 cells. For the CD20high B-cells, the AUEC ratio of 1 was within the 95% CI (AUEC 
ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-1.01). 
In the repeated dose toxicology study the same PD parameters were evaluated after 4 weekly iv 
administrations of 20 or 100 mg/kg. With these dose regimens no significant differences were 
observed. 
In study GP13-015, a slight, but non-significant difference in survival was observed in SCID mice 
injected with Granta-519 cells from human mantle cell lymphoma cell line treated with 40 mg/kg 
Riximyo(group 3; mean survival ± S.D.: 34.9 ± 3.74 days) and 40 mg/kg Mabthera (group 5; mean 
survival ± S.D.: 36.1 ± 2.63 days). 
In study GP13-018, where SCID mice were injected with Raji human Burkitt lymphoma cells, 1.25 
mg/kg Riximyo was significantly more effective than 1.25 mg/kg MabThera (P = 0.0485). Differences 
between the agents at the lower and higher dose levels were non-significant and overall no dose-
dependency was observed.

SCID beige mice were implanted subcutaneously with Jeko-1 cells into the right flank. When tumours reached a 
certain size, mice were dosed with either Privigen (IgG control antibody) or Riximyo or MabThera at indicated 
doses. Arrows indicate dosing days.

control antibody) against subcutaneous Jeko-1 xenograft tumours 
Data from both Study GP13-011 and Study GP13-014 indicate that treatment with Riximyoor 
MabThera at sub-therapeutic dose levels results in comparable tumour growth inhibition in mouse 
xenograft models of NHL. The relative anti-tumour activity of Riximyoand MabThera remained 
comparable throughout the observation periods and at all tested dose levels in both studies, despite 
the increase in intra-group heterogeneity at later time points that is characteristic of these xenograft 
models. 
Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
Dedicated secondary PD studies have not been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
There were no reports of toxicity caused by a lack of specificity for the primary target (i.e. there are no 
known off-target effects of rituximab) and there was no off-target binding of Riximyoin an in vitro 
cross-reactivity study performed in a comprehensive panel of human tissues.  
Safety Pharmacology 
Dedicated safety pharmacology studies have not been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic response was evaluated in Cynomolgus monkeys after a single 5 mg/kg 
dose for 9 days and after two weekly doses of 20 or 100 mg/kg for 14 days.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were performed forRiximyo.  
In a single dose PK/PD study in male cynomolgus monkeys a dose of 5 mg/kg of each product was 
administered i.v. to 14 animals per group. Both test items showed comparable safety profiles 
consistent with the pharmacology of rituximab when evaluated for up to ten weeks following dose 
administration. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study GP13-008 Riximyo / MabThera: Comparative repeated dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys 
This was a 4 week study with the purpose to compare the safety profile of Riximyo(commercial scale 
quality), to that of MabThera, following repeated iv administration to cynomolgus monkeys on the days 
1, 8, 15, and 22 of the study period plus a 4-week dosing-free period, and, in a subset of the animals, 
to assess comparability of the reversibility of the effects observed during a 6 month recovery phase.  
There were no detectable differences between test and reference item. Neither substance induced any 
toxicologically relevant findings in weekly dosing of 20 or 100 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Pharmacological 
findings were a massive but not total reduction of B lymphocytes starting on day 2 of dosing, which 
resulted in shifted immunophenotyping values and correlated with lacking germinal centres in 
lymphatic organs, accessory in single animals a lymphoid depletion of spleen or axillary lymph node. 
The recovery of B cell reduction was seen in all groups and comparable in test and reference item

dosed animals. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) can be defined at the high dose of 100 
mg/kg for the test item. 
Immunogenicity evaluations were included in the comparative single- and repeat-dose studies with 
Riximyo and MabThera. In both studies, cynomolgus monkey serum samples were analysed for the 
presence of anti-rituximab antibodies using an ELISA method. 
In the single-dose study all animals developed anti-rituximab antibodies between nine to 14 days after 
treatment with either Riximyo or MabThera, each of which was evaluated at a dose of 5 mg/kg. 
In the comparative repeat-dose toxicity study the number of animals that developed anti-rituximab 
antibodies were comparable at equivalent dose levels of Riximyo and MabThera. Anti-rituximab 
antibodies were detected in the 20 mg/kg Riximyo and MabThera groups starting on Day 15 (or 14 
days after the first dose); as a result, TK analyses were only performed up to Day 15. Antibodies were 
directed against the murine F(ab’)2 fragment of the drug and/or the Fc fragment of the drug. In the 
100 mg/kg treatment groups, most of the animals showed no (or only a marginal) immune response, 
which was likely a result of rapid and marked depletion of B cells and/or a high drug concentration-
induced tolerance.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
According to Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, the applicant used a stepwise approach in order to demonstrate 
the Riximyo is comparable to MabThera with respect to PD/PK and toxicity.  
Studies regarding secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and 
carcinogenicity and on local tolerance are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. 
A comprehensive program of studies provided extensive data that indicate an overall comparability 
between Riximyo and MabThera. Physicochemical assays have indicated that Riximyo is comparable to 
MabThera/Rituxan with regard to primary and higher order structure, post-translational modifications, 
and size variants. Functional characterisation included CD20 binding, C1q binding, and surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) Fc receptor affinity assays complemented by in vitro cell-based bioassays (ADCC 
assay, CDC assay, apoptosis assay).   
Additional whole blood and ADCC potency in vitro non-clinical studies were conducted and B cell 
depletion and ADCC potency of Riximyo was compared to both MabThera and Rituxan. Comparable B-
cell depletion was demonstrated. Different ADCC assay formats were used and the overall data indicate 
that EC50 values are similar.  
The ADCP assay is a Reporter Gene Assay (RGA) in which FcγRIIa-mediated activation of nuclear factor 
of activated T-cells (NFAT) is measured through the luciferase gene expression. The FcγRIIa-receptor 
is considered an important mediator in eliciting ADCP when phagocytes interact with antibody-
opsonised target cells. Other Fcγ-receptors are expressed as well by macrophages. However their 
contribution to ADCP is less certain. Furthermore, the functional activity of FcγRIIIa has already been 
captured by the comparative ADCC assays performed by the Applicant. The ADCP assay developed by 
the Applicant is considered appropriate to evaluate and compare the ADCP activity of Riximyo, 
Mabthera and Rituxan. The results of the ADCP assay support the conclusion of biosimilarity. 
Data submitted in support of this application are related to the comparison between the biosimilar and 
the US rituximab (Rituxan); this approach was acceptable and relevant for the EU since the bridge 
between the US and EU product has been sufficiently justified from analytical studies, structural and 
functional data (see discussion on quality). 
The PD profiles of Riximyo and MabThera were compared in a single-dose i.v. PK/PD and in a four-
week repeat-dose i.v. toxicity study in healthy Cynomolgus monkeys.  
The comparison of Riximyo  and MabThera over 8 weeks revealed comparable AUECs for Riximyo and 
for MabThera for both B cell subpopulations with ratios around 1.0 for both B cell subpopulations. With 
respect to total exposure to rituximab, the results of the non-compartmental PK analysis confirmed 
bioequivalence between Riximyo and MabThera with similar AUCs and 90% CIs lying entirely within the 
standard bioequivalence acceptance range of 0.8 to 1.25. 
The Applicant also included data from studies in two xenografted tumour models in mice. In these two 
different mouse xenograft models of human lymphomas both Riximyo and MabThera showed positive 
effects on animal survival compared to animals in the control groups. Animal survival was comparable 
between Riximyo and MabThera and clinical signs and body weight changes were comparable among 
all Riximyo and MabThera groups in both studies. Data from both studies demonstrate that treatment 
with Riximyo or MabThera results in comparable tumour growth inhibition in mouse xenograft models 
of NHL. In the SU-DHL-4 human B cell lymphoma CB17 SCID mouse xenograft model Riximyo 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 30/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appeared to be slightly more active than MabThera during the dosing period. But the overall outcome 
shows that treatment with Riximyo or MabThera showed no significant differences in short-term and 
overall efficacy results, early tumour growth and progression, and relative anti-tumour efficacies. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in the single dose study in monkeys and after once-
weekly i.v. (bolus) administrations of Riximyoor MabThera to male and female monkeys at dose levels 
of 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg given over a four-week period. A competitive ELISA method for the 
bioanalysis of rituximab in cynomolgus monkey serum was validated. A lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) was established. The validated ELISA method is acceptable. The results show comparable PK 
profiles at equivalent dose levels when evaluated for up to 14 days following the initial dose 
administration. Lower Cmax values (by 6 to 20%) were observed for Riximyocompared to MabThera at 
both dose levels which were attributed to intrinsic heterogeneity among individual monkeys and 
variations in the initial sampling time point. The justification is considered sufficient since the analysis 
showed comparable AUC values for the two treatment groups at equivalent dose levels, with 90% CI 
ratios within the standard acceptance range of 0.8 to 1.25. Furthermore B cell depletion seems not to 
be impacted by the lower Cmax. 
There were no signs of toxicity and no detectable differences between groups administered equivalent 
dose levels of Riximyoand MabThera in the four week repeat dose i.v. toxicity study in monkeys. The 
no observed adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for Riximyoin the four week study was reported to be 100 
mg/kg, the highest dose level evaluated and which exceeds clinical dose levels of MabThera/Rituxan. 
There was no off-target binding of Riximyo in an in vitro cross-reactivity study performed in a 
comprehensive panel of human tissues. All binding was related to the expected pharmacology of 
Riximyo and its ability to bind CD20 expressing B lymphocytes, consistent with the reversible effects 
that were observed on B cell numbers in the single and repeat dose studies in monkeys and with the 
beneficial effects of Riximyo in mouse xenograft human B cell models of NHL. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the light of the overall in vitro and in vivo non-clinical data , Riximyo (rituximab) can be considered 
similar to the reference product Mabthera. The non-clinical information under section 5.3 of the 
Mabthera SmPC applies also to Riximyo.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three studies were submitted to support the pharmacokinetics part of the application: the pivotal 
study GP13-201-Part 1 compared the PK profiles of Riximyoand MabThera in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), the supportive study GP13-301 compared the PK profiles of Riximyo and MabThera in a 
subset of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the other supportive study GP13-101 compared 
the PK profiles of Riximyo and Rituxan studied in 6 Japanese patients with indolent Non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL).  
Analytical methods 
ELISA was used for the determination of rituximab concentrations in human RA and FL serum. For the 
determination of immunogenicity an affinity capture elution (ACE) ELISA for detection of antibodies 
against rituximab in human RA serum and an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging 
immunogenicity assay for detection of antibodies against rituximab in human FL serum were used. In 
order to determine neutralizing antibodies a cell-based complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
assay for detection of neutralizing antibody (NAb) in RA serum and a cell-based competitive ligand 
binding assay (CLB) assay for detection of NAb in FL serum. The assay methods were validated 
separately using the respective patient-specific serum matrix (i.e. serum of RA and FL patients) as 
serum of patients suffering from either RA or FL can differ in their matrix composition. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pivotal PK/PD bioequivalence study GP13-201 in patients with RA (GP13-201 Study Part I) 
The purpose of this clinical PK/PD study was to assess bioequivalence between Riximyo and EU-
approved MabThera as well as US-licensed Rituxan in patients with active RA. Therefore the study was 
set up in two parts, Part I for assessing bioequivalence between Riximyo and MabThera and Part II for 
assessing bioequivalence between Riximyo and Rituxan. Study Part I is completed; an overview of the 
study design for Study Part I is shown in the figure below.

Figure 5 - Study design for GP13-201 Part 1 
The study included male and female patients ≥ 18 years of age with a ≥ 6 months’ diagnosis of RA 
based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 criteria. Patients had to be seropositive 
for rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-CCP antibodies, had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
non-biologic DMARDs and one or up to three TNF antagonists, and had been receiving MTX (7.5 mg to 
a maximum of 25 mg per week) for at least 4 months; stable dose for 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
The eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive the first course of study medication (a 1000 mg 
i.v. infusion of Riximyo or MabThera on two separate occasions, two weeks apart (i.e., on Day 1 and 
on Day 15)). The duration of the first study drug infusion (Day 1) was approximately 4 h 15 min and 
the duration of the second study drug infusion (Day 15) was approximately 3 h 15 min (if the first 
infusion was uneventful). After the first treatment with study medication on Day 1, patients were 
followed for 52 weeks. Samples for comparative PK and PD assessments were collected until Week 24 
and Week 52, respectively. Efficacy and safety data were assessed on a regular basis until Week 52 
and were used to evaluate the similarity of the efficacy and safety between Riximyo and MabThera. 
Results 
A total of 302 patients were screened, of which 173 patients met the eligibility criteria and were 
randomized to either Riximyo (n=86) or MabThera (n=87) treatment group. The majority of 
randomized patients (n=142, 82.1%) completed the study up to 52 weeks and few patients (n=31, 
17.9%) discontinued the study. The most common reasons for premature discontinuation across both

treatment groups were adverse events (n=8, 4.6%), unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (n=8, 4.6%) 
and withdrawal of consent (n=6, 3.5%). 
All patients in the Full Analysis Set (FAS = 86 patients for study drug, 87 patients for Mabthera) 
received study drug at least once and are therefore also included in the Safety (SAF) Analysis Set. 
Patients with major protocol deviations such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) values who did not meet the criteria either at baseline or at the unscheduled 
reassessment visit, patients having negative RF and negative ACPA at the screening visit or patients 
not been treated with randomized treatment, were excluded from the PK or Per Protocol (PP = 85 for 
study drug, 82 patients for Mabthera) or both analysis sets. Pharmacokinetic analysis Set (PAS; 86 
patients for study drug, 86 patients for Mabthera) was used for the analyses of PK, PD parameters.

Table 6 - Baseline disease history by treatment (Full Analysis Set) 
All patients received anti-TNFs and non-biologic DMARDs prior to entering the study. The most 
commonly reported prior RA-related medications (excluding anti- TNFs) were selective 
immunosuppressants (23.1%) and glucocorticoids (19.1%). Etanercept was the most frequently used 
(34.1%) prior TNF-α inhibitor, followed by adalimumab (23.1%) and infliximab (15.6%). There were 
no relevant differences between the treatment groups in the type or frequency of use of prior 
(discontinued) RA-related medications.

There were no relevant differences between the two treatment groups in terms of non RA related 
medications and significant non-drug therapies used (and discontinued) prior to start of study drug 
(Riximyo 10.5% and MabThera 10.3%). 
One patient in the MabThera group was accidentally un-blinded by a study nurse via the IRT system on 
Day 32. The accidental un-blinding was recorded as a protocol deviation and the patient discontinued 
from the study. The patient was not excluded from any analysis set. 
Table 7 - Baseline disease characteristics by treatment (Full Analysis Set) 
The mean DAS28 (CRP) scores at baseline were 5.81 (SD=0.916) and 5.85 (SD=0.880), in the 
Riximyo and MabThera groups, respectively. The proportions of patients with positive anti-CCP 
antibodies (ACPA) and/or rheumatoid factor (RF) were similar, approximately 98% in both treatment 
arms. The mean steroid and methotrexate (MTX) doses taken were nearly identical between the 
treatment arms at baseline.

Primary objective (GP13-201 Study Part I) 
The primary PK endpoint was AUC(0-inf) in serum samples, collected over 24 weeks. The ratio of the 
geometric means (Riximyo/MabThera) of AUC(0-inf) of serum concentration up to Week 24 was 1.064 
and the 90% CI [0.968, 1.169] which was within the standard bioequivalence limits.  
Table 8 - AUC(0-inf) of serum concentration-time profile: Comparison between Riximyo and 
MabThera using ANOVA - GP13-201 Study Part I (PAS)
A sensitivity analysis including body surface area as an additional covariate provided similar results.  
The ratio of the geometric means (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.054.  
The corresponding 90% CI (0.965, 1.151) was within the standard bioequivalence limits. 
Following the first treatment course of Riximyo and MabThera, the overall exposure, AUC(0-inf), was 
comparable between the Riximyo and MabThera treatment arms and the mean serum concentration-
time profiles over 24 weeks were nearly superimposable.

Summary statistics for primary PK parameter (AUC(0-inf)) by treatment are provided in Table 9. 
Table 9 - Summary of primary PK parameter by treatment - GP13-201 Study Part I (PAS) 
A number of patients were excluded from the analyses: for AUC0-inf (GP2013: n=11/86 (12.8%), 
MabThera: 16/87 (18.4%)) and for AUEC0-14d (GP2013: n=14/86 (16.3%), MabThera: 11/87 
(12.6%)). The most common reason of exclusion of patients was positive ADA prior to or up to Week 
24 and missing data noted to the extent that the parameter could not be derived. A number of patients 
were excluded from the analyses for Cmax1 (GP2013: n=7/86 (8.1%), MabThera: 9/87 (10.3%)). The 
most common reason for exclusion of patients from the Cmax1 analysis was that the post-infusion 
sample was not taken within 15 minutes of end of infusion, positive ADA at pretreatment and infusion 
interruption greater than 1 hr during the first infusion. 
Secondary PK results (GP13-201 Study Part I) 
Key Secondary endpoint Cmax1 
The key secondary PK endpoint was a comparison of the maximum serum concentrations of Riximyo 
and MabThera after the 1st infusion (Cmax1). Bioequivalence was defined and analysed similar to the 
primary endpoint (AUC(0-inf)). The ratio of the geometric means (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.133 and 
the corresponding 90% CI was [1.017, 1.262] with its upper limit slightly outside the standard 
bioequivalence limits [0.8, 1.25] (Table 10). Cmax2 was within the standard bioequivalence limits [0.8, 
1.25].

When studying study drug administration and compliance, the two treatment arms behaved similarly 
(e.g. regarding number of infusions, duration, volume of infusion.) regarding interruptions, more 
patients in both treatment arms experienced infusion interruptions during the first infusion (total of 26 
(15.0%) patients) as compared to the second infusion (total of 12 (7.1%) patients). When comparing 
both treatment arms, there were more infusion interruptions in the MabThera arm (17.2% versus 
12.9% for the first infusion of the first course) and 9.1% versus 4.7% for the second infusion of the 
first course, respectively. Similar observation was made for the second course. 
Other secondary endpoints 
The bioequivalence criteria were also met for all secondary AUC parameters (AUC(0-14d), AUC(0-
12w), and AUC(0-24w) and Tmax (for both infusions, i.e. Tmax1 and Tmax2) as shown in Table 11.

PK/PD - Pivotal clinical efficacy and safety study in patients with FL (study GP13-301)  
This was a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel group study to compare 
the efficacy, safety, PK and PD of Riximyo/MabThera in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, prednisone (CVP), followed by Riximyo/MabThera maintenance therapy in patients with 
previously untreated, advanced stage FL. The study comprised four periods: Screening (up to 28 days 
prior to randomization), Combination Treatment (8 cycles; approximately 6 months), Maintenance 
Treatment (2 years) and Follow up (3 years from the date of randomization) (see  
Figure 7 below).

Figure 7 - treatment scheme in study GP13-301 
After fulfilling the eligibility criteria evaluated during the screening period, the patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 8 cycles of either Riximyo with CVP or MabThera with CVP in the 
combination treatment phase of the study (Table 12). 
Table 12 - Combination treatment arms - study GP13-301 
Randomisation into the two treatment arms (Riximyo-CVP or MabThera-CVP) was stratified by 
Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) risk group (Solal-Celigny et al 2004) for 
low/intermediate risk (FLIPI score 0-2) vs. high risk (FLIPI score 3-5), geographic region (Asia Pacific, 
Latin America, Japan and Europe) and by participating cohort for PK data collection (Cohort 2: 
extensive PK sampling; Cohort 1 exclusive of Cohort 2: sparse PK sampling; rest of patients without PK 
sampling). An overview of PK/PD cohorts is diagrammatically presented in Figure 8.

196 patients were allocated to Cohort 1, in which sparse PK sampling, Ctrough and Cmax 
concentrations were taken for Cycles 1, 4 and 8. A further subgroup of Cohort 1 of 54 patients 
(approximately 20 patients per treatment arm), underwent more extensive PK sampling during Cycle 4 
and pharmacodynamic sampling during Cycle 1 (Cohort 2).  
The analysis sets used for the analyses of data locked on 30-Sep-2015 are summarised in Table 13. 
Table 13 - Analysis sets by treatment (Randomized set) 
Two PK analysis sets were defined for this analysis: 
 
The PAS+A1 (N=239) consisted of all patients in Cohort 1 (including Cohort 2 patients), who 
received at least one (partial or complete) dose of investigational treatment (Riximyo or 
MabThera) and had at least one evaluable PK sample collected and analysed. The PAS+A1 was 
used to present the descriptive statistics for Cmax and Ctrough of Riximyo and MabThera 
during Cycles 1, 4 and 8. Observed values of Cmax (end of infusion, EOI) and Ctrough (pre-
Assessment report

dose) were reported. Particularly, Cmax and Ctrough at steady state (Cycle 4) were assessed 
as secondary objectives. 
 
The PAS+A2 (N=49) consisted of all patients in Cohort 2, who received the investigational 
treatment (Riximyo or MabThera) and provided at least one evaluable PK sample after the 
Cycle 4 dose. A non-compartmental PK analysis of serum concentration time profile of Riximyo 
and MabThera was conducted based on PAS+A2 to obtain the AUC0-tau (AUC0-21days) and 
AUCall during Cycle 4 (near steady state). This subgroup also underwent PD sampling during 
Cycle 1. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
Overall, baseline demographic and background characteristics were well balanced for the Riximyo and 
MabThera treatment arms and reflected the intended target population for the study. 
The demographics were similar between the treatment arms in terms of age, gender, race or body 
surface area (BSA). The mean age of all patients was 56.9 years ranging between 23 to 84 years (57.5 
years in Riximyo and 56.4 years in MabThera) and 46.1% of patients were ≥ 60 years of age (47.8% 
in Riximyo and 44.4% MabThera). More than half (58% in Riximyo and 53.7% MabThera) of patients 
in the FAS were female and approximately two-third (68.6% in Riximyo and 65.7% MabThera) of the 
total patients were Caucasian. The majority of patients (57.4% in Riximyo and 55.6% MabThera) had 
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0. 
Secondary objective (GP13-301 Study), PAS + A1 
The geometric mean and (CV% geometric mean) of the secondary endpoint Cmax at Cycle 4 Day 1 
was 333.59 mcg/mL (41.09%) and 331.93 mcg/mL (35.32%) for the Riximyo and MabThera arms, 
respectively (Table 14). In addition to Cmax in Cycle 4, Cmax in Cycles 1 and 8 were also evaluated. 
The geometric means ratio of Cmax at Cycle 4 Day 1 (Riximyo /MabThera) was 1.00 and the 
corresponding 90% CI was (0.925, 1.09). Based on the results, the Cmax at Cycle 4 Day 1 (near 
steady state) was similar between the Riximyo and MabThera arms. Also Cmax at Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
Cycle 8 Day 1 were similar between the Riximyo and MabThera arms.

Table 14 - Summary of rituximab Cmax (mcg/mL), by treatment (Cohort 1) – study GP13-

The secondary endpoint, mean Ctrough levels at Cycle 4 Day 1 evaluated in Cohort 1 was 66.42 
mcg/mL (CV% 71.7 %) and 82.13 mcg/mL (CV% 74.9 %) for the Riximyoand MabThera arms, 
respectively. The Ctrough levels are similar in Cycle 4 Day 1 (around steady state) and Cycle 8 Day 1 
and between Riximyoand MabThera and the data ranges in both arms largely overlap. The CV% was 
high (greater than 70% in Cycle 4) and this was due to the fact that many patients have Ctrough 
levels below the limit of detection and were reported as 0.

GP13-301 Study: Secondary objective; PAS + A2 
The geometric mean (CV% geometric mean) for AUC(0-21d) during Cycle 4 evaluated in Cohort 2 was 
3210 mcg*day/mL (27.5%) and 3340 mcg*day/mL (34.9%) for the Riximyo and MabThera treatment 
arms, respectively. Since many patients had rituximab concentrations below LLOQ at later time points 
of the Cycle 4 PK profile (e.g., 360 h after EOI or pre-dose Cycle 5), their AUC(0-21d) could not be 
accurately determined. In such cases, area under the curve from the time of dosing to the time of the 
last observation, regardless of whether the last concentration was measureable or not (AUCall) was 
used for exposure evaluation. The geometric mean (CV% geometric mean) for AUCall during Cycle 4 
evaluated in Cohort 2 was 2510 mcg*day/mL (55.1%) and 2310 mcg*day/mL (109.1%) for the 
Riximyo and MabThera treatment arms, respectively. Based on the results, the AUC(0-21d) and AUCall 
are similar between the Riximyo and MabThera arms.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies on the mechanism of action have been submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
B-cell depletion as a marker for the effect of rituximab 
Analytical methods 
Peripheral B-cell counts were measured after immunostaining by flow cytometry assay. As CD19+ B-
cell depletion is considered a surrogate for CD20+ B-cell depletion, CD19+ analysis on B-cells has been 
validated as an exploratory biomarker of Riximyo/MabThera activity by Quintiles and Eurofins.  
PD results; Key secondary PD endpoint: B-cell depletion – AUEC(0-14d) (GP13-201 Study Part I) 
In addition to evaluating PK bioequivalence, the GP13-201 study also evaluated equivalence in terms 
of depletion of peripheral B-cells in response to Riximyo or MabThera defined as “area under the effect-
time curves” (AUECs) of the percent change of the blood B-cell count relative to baseline up to the 
second infusion (i.e. Day 15). Other supportive PD endpoints were also evaluated as described below. 
In order to conclude equivalence, the 95% CI of ratio of the geometric means (Riximyo/MabThera) had 
to be within the pre-specified equivalence limits of [0.8, 1.25]. 
The ratio of the geometric means (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.019 and the corresponding 95% CI 
[0.997, 1.042] was within the pre-specified equivalence limits. Therefore, the secondary endpoint for 
equivalence was met. 
Table 18 - AUEC(0-14d) of percent B-cells relative to baseline: Comparison between Riximyo 
and MabThera using ANOVA (GP13-201 Study Part I) (PAS)

baseline following Riximyo or MabThera infusion at Days 15, Week 12, 16, and 24 and proportion of

patients in whom the peripheral blood CD20+ B-cell counts decreased below the detection limit at 
Days 1 (before first infusion), 4, 8 and 15 (before second infusion). The mean percentage of B-cell 
counts relative to baseline over time was also similar between the two treatments. 
Figure 10 - Arithmetic mean (SD) of percent B-cell relative to baseline over 52 weeks by 
treatment - (GP13-201 Study Part I) (PAS) 
Overall, the proportion of patients with B-cell counts below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
comparable between Riximyo and MabThera on Days 4, 8 and 15. More than 50% patients by Day 8 
and more than 70% patients by Day 1 5 were below the LLOQ in both treatment groups.

Peripheral CD20+ B-cells percentage relative to baseline (study GP13-301) 
In addition to evaluating efficacy of Riximyo compared to MabThera in FL patients, the study evaluated 
peripheral CD20+ B-cell depletion in terms of AUEC(0-21d) of percent change in blood CD20+ B-cell 
count relative to baseline following the treatment with Riximyo-CVP and MabThera-CVP. This study was 
not powered for PD analysis and all PD data were presented using descriptive statistics. 
Pharmacodynamics (PD) analyses were conducted using Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set (PDAS). 
The PDAS consisted of 48 patients, 24 in the Riximyo and MabThera arms, respectively. The PDAS 
included patients in Cohort 2 who received Cycle 1 of investigational drug and had at least one post-
baseline pharmacodynamic sample collected and analysed.

The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set (PDAS) was used to analyze AUEC(0-21d) of all patients who 
received the investigational treatment (Riximyo or MabThera) during Cycle 1 in Cohort 2. Blood 
samples for this PD assessment were taken at screening and at the following time points during Cycle 
1: pre-dose, EOI, 24 hours after EOI, 72 after EOI, and prior to Cycle 2. The baseline was defined as 
the mean of peripheral CD20+ B-cell counts at screening and predose of Cycle 1. For each patient, the 
percentage relative to baseline for peripheral CD20+ B-cell counts was calculated. The PD profile in 
terms of peripheral CD20+ B-cells percentage relative to baseline was similar between Riximyo and 
MabThera.

AUEC(0-21d) for peripheral CD20+ B-cell counts in Cycle 1 was a secondary endpoint, which was 
calculated using the percentage relative to baseline data for peripheral CD20+ B-cell counts. The mean 
AUEC(0-21d) during Cycle 1 evaluated in Cohort 2 was 1830 %*day (CV% 18.7%) and 1920 %*day 
(CV% 12.0%) for the Riximyo and MabThera arms, respectively.The geometric means ratio of AUEC(0-
21d) (%*day) of peripheral B-cells (Cohort 2) (Riximyo /MabThera) was 0.939, and the corresponding 
90% CI was [0.845; 1.04]). The summary results show that the AUEC(0-21d) in Cycle 1 is similar 
between the two treatment arms.

 Immunogenicity 
No special studies were conducted with immunogenicity assessment as primary objective under 
Riximyo clinical development program; however, GP13-201 study in patients with RA, GP13-301 study 
in patients with FL and GP13-101 study in Japanese patients with indolent NHL contributed to the 
immunogenicity data for immunology and oncology set-up. 
Bioanalytical methods for immunogenicity assessment: 
The immunogenicity evaluation of rituximab as determined by the formation of antibodies against 
rituximab was made by a 3-step procedure comprising a validated screening and confirmatory as well 
as a titer assay based on an ELISA (used for RA study GP13-201) or bridging 
electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) format (used for FL studies GP13-101 and GP13-301) and a 
validated neutralising antibody (NAb) assay. For the ADA screening, confirmatory and titer assays, 
anti-rituximab antibodies were used as positive control. For the NAb assay, a neutralising anti-
rituximab antibody was used. 
Immunogenicity in RA patients (GP13-201 Study Part I) 
A total of 173 patients (86 in Riximyo and 87 in MabThera arms) were evaluated for immunogenicity.  
According to the protocol, samples to assess the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were collected 
at visits 3 (predose), 8 (14 days post dose), and 11 to 14 (96, 154, 252, 350 days post dose) and in 
case of retreatment (pre dose) and at the 26 week retreatment follow up: 
At randomization (pre-treatment), ADAs were detected in 2 (1.2%) patients in MabThera arm and 
these 2 patients were excluded from further ADA summary. However, none of these 2 patients had 
ADAs detected at later time points. Interestingly, ADAs to rituximab were also detected in 3.6% of 
placebo-treated patients with active RA in the SERENE study (Emery et al 2010). Overall, post-
treatment ADA was detected in 9 out of 82 (11.0%) patients in the Riximyo and 18 out of 84 (21.4%) 
patients in the MabThera arm.  
Samples with confirmed positive ADAs were further assessed for the neutralizing capacity of the 
antibodies using a cell based assay (NAb assay). A total of four patients exhibited NAbs, 3 out of 82 
(3.7%) patients in the Riximyo arm and 1 out of 84 (1.2%) patient in the MabThera arm. Among 
them, two patients, one in the Riximyo arm and one in the MabThera arm showed ADA titer > 100 
mcg/mL. The highest ADA concentration (>2000 mcg/mL) in patients with NAb was detected for the 
positive determined patient in the MabThera arm. 
Immunogenicity in FL patients (study GP13-301) 
In this study, immunogenicity (ADA) was assessed for all patients at screening (or pre-dose or both), 
End of treatment (EOT) Combination Phase, and EOT Maintenance Phase. For Cohort 1 patients, an 
additional immunogenicity assessment was performed at pre-dose Cycle 4 Day 1. Patients with pre-
existing immunogenicity were excluded from this assessment. 
Overall, five patients with pre-existing ADAs at screening, were excluded from this assessment. Four of 
these patients (three in Riximyo arm and one in MabThera arm) were consistently ADA negative at 
later visits whereas one patient in the Riximyo group had confirmed non-neutralising ADA positive 
result at the end of the maintenance phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 51/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 551 (87.6%) patients were included in the immunogenicity analysis, 268 (85.4%) patients in 
the Riximyo and 283 (89.8%) patients in the MabThera arm. Overall, the number of patients with 
detectable post-dose ADAs was low in the study (n/N=8/551 (1.5%)), with no significant differences 
between Riximyo (n/N=5/268 (1.9%)) and the MabThera (n/N=3/283 (1.1%)) arms. This is 
comparable with data provided for NHL patients in the MabThera SmPC: 1.1% of patients with DLBCL 
developed human anti-chimeric antibodies. Based on the limited PK data in ADA positive patients, 
there is no indication that ADA is having an impact on PK exposure. 
Overall, NAbs were detected in 2 out of 268 (0.7%) patients in the Riximyo group and 2 out of 283 
(0.7%) patients in the MabThera group. Among them, one in the Riximyo group was detected at the 
end of Maintenance Treatment Phase. All other NAb positive incidences were detected during the 
combination phase. An assessment of safety parameters found that all four patients had no AEs of 
infusion-related reactions. One patient in MabThera group died due to cardiac arrest and had several 
SAEs of which two SAEs (neutropenia) were considered to be related to study drug. This patient also 
had grade 3 chills after the first infusion. Overall, all four incidences of NAb showed no link with any 
immunogenicity related SAEs or diminished efficacy. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The analytical methods used are appropriate and well-described. In general, the pre-specified criteria 
for the different validation parameters are in line with the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
and were fulfilled. 
From the pharmacokinetics point of view, the PK pivotal Study GP13-201-Part 1 and supportive study 
GP13-301 are considered sufficient to demonstrate biosimilarity between the test and reference 
product. Supportive Study GP13-101 is less relevant as the rituximab product used is Rituxan licensed 
in Japan- considering no bridge between the EU Mabthera and Rituxan (Japan) has been established. 
The number and type of studies submitted are in line with EMA Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1). 
The biosimilar comparability limit were met for the primary PK parameter AUC(0-inf) from RA patients 
in study GP13-201 Part I. Uncertainties about  the exclusion of ADA positive patients from PK 
evaluation and the calculation of adjusted mean values were discussed, however there was no relevant 
difference observed in the PK exposure of ADA positive RA patients compared to patients who did not 
develop ADAs in study GP13-201. Considering that the (geometric) mean and median of the half-life of 
the two products are very similar, a statistically significant difference in AUC values by ADA status was 
unlikely.  
In study GP13-201 Cmax1 slightly exceeded the upper limit (i.e. 126%), this was due to the high 
variability caused by longer duration and more escalation steps during the 1st infusion in comparison 
to the 2nd infusion. It is agreed that for a drug product delivered via infusion, the peak systemic 
concentrations represent the end-of-infusion concentrations which are highly dependent on infusion 
rate and are therefore not adequate as a measure for bioavailability. Cmax2 was within the standard 
bioequivalence limits [0.8, 1.25]. Therefore, the criterion of bioequivalence was met.   
Due to the sparse sampling of PK data in study GP13-301 in FL patients, the value of these data for 
the decision on PK similarity is limited and only supportive. The descriptive PK results do not fully 
support PK similarity of Ctrough at predose cycle 4 (mean Ctrough 66.4 vs. 82.1 mcg/mL for Riximyo 
and MabThera, resp.) with Riximyo exposure being around 10% lower than in the MabThera group. On 
the other hand, comparison of pre-dose cycle 8 Ctrough values (123 vs. 127 µg/mL for Riximyo and 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 52/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MabThera, respectively) supports similarity between the groups. Frequency of BLQ samples in both 
treatment arms was low in both ADA positive and ADA negative patients and comparable between the 
treatment groups. This indicated that Ctrough results from cohort 1 are not biased by BLQ treatment. 
The comparison of AUC(0-21d) in Cohort2 (subgroup with full profile) was also influenced by the fact 
that many patients (around 25%) had rituximab concentrations below LLOQ at later time points of the 
Cycle 4 PK profile (e.g., 360 h after EOI or pre-dose Cycle 5) so that their AUC(0-21d) could not be 
accurately determined. However, AUC comparison in the remaining patients (n=20 and 17) in cohort 2 
rather supports similarity and does not indicate a large difference in bioavailability of Riximyo and 
MabThera during steady state in the presence of co-medication. Since the difference between AUCall 
(area under the curve from the time of dosing to the time of the last observation, regardless of 
whether the last concentration was measureable or not) and AUC(0-21d) was the same in both groups, 
observation and handling of BLQ samples appeared to have no relevant impact on the supportive 
evidence for biosimilarity. 
PK data from the rheumatoid arthritis and follicular lymphoma patients are being extrapolated to the 
other oncology indications (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and auto-immune indications (i.e. 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis). In all indications, the clearance of 
rituximab occurs through two pathways: the non-specific IgG clearance pathways and the target 
mediated drug disposition (TMDD) pathway. The non-specific IgG clearance pathways are reported to 
be mediated by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and to various Fc receptors (FcγRs). 
Riximyo and MabThera, being similar in structure, bind to FcRn and various FcγRs with similar affinity. 
The TMDD pathway for rituximab is mediated by binding to the CD20 receptor on target cells. It is 
known that the extent of TMDD in various populations is correlated to the CD20+ B-cell levels (or 
tumour load in haematologic oncology indications), which differ within and between populations (e.g. 
CD20+ B-cell NHLs << CLL). Despite the expected difference in CD20+ B-cell levels and extent of 
TMDD in different disease indications, the same clearance mechanisms (non-specific and TMDD) is 
expected. In addition, the comparable in vitro binding properties of Riximyo combined with the human 
comparability data in B-cell depletion from both the autoimmune (RA) and oncology (FL) indications, 
provide sufficient evidence that the clearance of Riximyo is expected to be comparable to that of 
MabThera in all indications that are approved for MabThera. Therefore, an extrapolation of the PK data 
from rheumatoid arthritis and follicular lymphoma patients to the other oncology and auto-immune 
indications of MabThera can be considered acceptable. 
The discriminative power of the PD parameter AUEC(0-14d) of B-cell depletion (based on 3 data 
points) is considered low, since B-cell depletion was almost complete  from day 3 to week 12 in both 
arms of study GP13-201. The similar time courses of B-cell recovery after 16 weeks can be considered 
as supportive for similarity, since the time interval of B-cell recovery is considered to be quite sensitive 
for detecting differences. On the other hand, potential differences might be more indicative for other 
(patient) factors than for PK differences. In contrast to the PK analysis, ADA positive patients were 
included in PD evaluation of study GP13-201.  The individual time courses of B cell depletion by ADA 
status showed that inclusion of ADA positive patients did not have a significant impact on the 
evaluation of the time course of B cell recovery. In study GP13-301, B-cell depletion was complete in 
all samples over the whole treatment cycle, thus, the discriminative power of the parameter AUEC(0-
21d) for detecting differences is also low. 
As far as known, there is no strong correlation between the extent of B-cell reduction and the extent of 
the clinical response in RA. For NHL, the correlation is even less clear, since circulating B-cells may not 
directly reflect tumour mass, and this response cannot be considered as an appropriate surrogate of 
the clinical response. Nevertheless, the comparative B-cell depletion data are considered relevant for 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 53/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the assessment of bio-similarity and extrapolation to other non-investigated indications, since the B-
cell levels indirectly reflect the potency of the drug of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and programmed cell death; these mechanisms of action 
are applicable to all indications. 
As part of immunogenicity assessment the following aspects were considered, according to EMA’s 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins: i) rate of 
ADAs; ii) hyper-acute / acute reactions; iii) delayed reactions and iv) autoimmunity (cross-reactivity to 
an endogenous counterpart) (See Clinical safety). 
Two different assay formats were used for the determination of immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies, 
ADA) in the sera of the two pivotal studies (affinity capture elution ELISA method for the RA patient 
serum samples and the ECL assay for the FL serum measurements) and 2 approaches for the detection 
of neutralizing anti-rituximab antibodies (NAb assay) were applied: In RA study GP13-201, a cell-based 
CDC assay format was chosen, whereas in the FL study, due to very strong matrix interference in FL 
serum, the assay format had to be changed to a competitive ligand binding assay format.  
Both immunogenicity screening assays are considered appropriate to detect ADAs, however, the assay 
in FL serum is considered more reliable than the RA assay in terms of sensitivity and drug tolerance. 
Both assay formats are designed to measure Riximyo-specific ADAs rather than MabThera-specific 
ADAs. No data were provided on the use of the originator substance rituximab as capture and bridging 
antigen which could demonstrate antigenic equivalence of Riximyo and MabThera for binding of ADAs 
in the assays. The chosen design may overestimate ADA incidence of Riximyo vs. MabThera rather 
than vice versa, it therefore does not give a competitive edge for the biosimilar product. From a 
comparison of drug concentration present in the immunogenicity samples, it can be concluded that the 
majority (75%) of NAb incidence results can be considered as conclusive. 
There are only few data on the incidence of ADA after intravenous application of MabThera in RA 
patients from other clinical studies for comparison: Similar (slightly lower) incidences of treatment-
emergent ADA (13,5 % and 17.6 %) were observed in recent biosimilar PK trials for the RA patient 
group receiving MabThera (Cohen et al. 2016 and Yoo et al. 2013). The longer observation period in 
the Riximyo study (including the time period of B cell recovery) compared to the literature data is 
considered as supportive for a proper immunogenicity assessment and might be a reason for 
observation of higher incidences. It is agreed that comparison between studies in literature may be 
due to different assays used. At any rate, it is likely that the difference of -10% could be a chance 
finding and ultimately it is not of concern since immunogenicity –if anything—is lower than that of the 
reference product which is in accordance with the overarching guidelines (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1;  
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
Immunogenicity results revealed the ADA incidence being 2-fold lower in RA patients treated with 
Riximyo compared to MabThera (11.0 % vs. 21.4 %). The statistical significance and potential reasons 
of this finding was questioned. The incidences lie in the range of treatment-emergent ADA incidences 
(13.5 % and 17.6 %) observed in recent trials in RA patients receiving MabThera (Cohen et al. 2016 
and Yoo et al. 2013). In the oncology setting a lower immunogenicity of Riximyo (2.1%) and MabThera 
(0.9%) was observed; however, significance of this result is limited. The observed number of patients 
with ADA (including NAb) in trial GP13-301 was very low which can probably attributed to the 
immunosuppressive effect of the concomitant chemotherapy. Therefore, this population is not the most 
sensitive population for detecting a difference in immunogenicity. ADA incidence for MabThera in this 
study was similar to the 1.1 % observed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients receiving 
MabThera 375 mg/m2 plus standard CHOP chemotherapy every 3 weeks for eight cycles (see 
MabThera SmPC).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Comparison of PK parameters and the time courses of B-cell depletion as PD biomarker in both studies 
shows biosimilarity of Riximyo to Mabthera, which is supported  by the similar time courses of B-cell 
recovery after 16 weeks (and by ADA status).   
An extrapolation of the PK/PD data from rheumatoid arthritis and follicular lymphoma patients to the 
other oncology and auto-immune indications of MabThera is acceptable due to the same clearance 
mechanisms (non-specific and target-mediated), similar in vitro binding properties of Riximyo and 
comparable human data in B-cell depletion from both the autoimmune (RA) and oncology (NHL) 
indications.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints included ORR, CR, PR, PFS, and OS. Efficacy was evaluated using Modified Response 
Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma based on contrast-enhanced Computerized tomography (CT) or 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and bone marrow evaluations. B-symptoms were also evaluated at 
the same time points as tumour assessments. 
Sample size 
Anticipating an expected overall response rate of 81% for both treatment arms and a pre-specified 
equivalence margin of 12%, it was calculated that a total of 556 patients (288 per arm) were required 
to assess equivalence of Riximyo to the reference drug at a two one-sided significance level of 2.5% 
with 90% power. In order to allow for 10% of drop-outs and major protocol violations, a total of 618 
patients were planned to be randomized; 629 patients were actually randomized into the study. 
The equivalence margin (δ) was based on historical data of a phase III study in patients with 
previously untreated advanced FL (Ann Arbor classification stages III to IV), where the patients 
received either CVP plus MabThera (n=162) or CVP (n=159) (Marcus 2005). The observed ORR in the 
study was 81% for the MabThera-CVP arm and 57% for CVP arm, the observed add-on effect of CVP 
plus MabThera on ORR was 24% (95%-CI: 14% to 34%). The equivalence margin of 12% was 
determined considering the variability of the point estimate of the add-on effect (24%) by taking a 
value lower than the lower bound of the 95% CI for MabThera-CVP vs. CVP obtained from the historical 
data.  
An approximate cohort of 100 patients per treatment arm (Cohort 1, who consented to the trial) 
underwent PK sampling. A further subgroup of approximately 20 patients per arm (Cohort 2, i.e., 40 of 
the patients in Cohort 1), also were to undergo extensive PK sampling during Cycle 4 and 
pharmacodynamic sampling during Cycle 1. Immunogenicity (ADA) formation) samples were collected 
from all patients.

Figure 14 - Planned PK/Pharmacodynamic cohort design 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised (via IRT) in an 1:1 ratio to receive either Riximyo-CVP or MabThera-CVP in 
a 1:1. Randomisation was stratified by FLIPI risk group (FLIPI score 0-2 vs. FLIPI score 3-5), 
geographic region (Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Europe) and by participating cohort for PK data 
collection (Cohort 2: extensive PK sampling; Cohort 1 exclusive of Cohort 2: sparse PK sampling; rest 
of patients without PK sampling). 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigator site staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts in this study 
remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock 
(DBL). As the appearance of the test and reference product was not identical, the preparation of the 
study medication was performed by dedicated unblinded site staff not involved in the further conduct 
of the study. Unblinding was to occur only in the case of patient emergencies, for regulatory reporting 
purposes, and at the conclusion of the study. Unblinding occurred when the primary DBL was reached 
(i.e. when all randomized patients have completed the combination treatment period).  
Statistical methods 
In general data were summarised by statistical characteristics (categorical data: absolute and relative 
frequencies; continuous data: mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) stratified 
by treatment group and visit (where applicable). 
Efficacy analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR during the combination phase as based on Central Blinded 
Review of radiological response. The primary analysis of ORR was based on the per-protocol set (PPS). 
Equivalence was to be concluded in case the 95% CI for the difference of proportions in ORR between 
both treatment groups fell completely into the pre-defined equivalence range (-12%, 12%). Normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution was used to generate the 95% CI. In addition a logistic 
regression model with the exploratory variables FLIPI score and treatment was used to derive an 
estimate and associated 90% CI of the odds ratio of treatment difference (Riximyo versus MabThera) 
adjusting for FLIPI score. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 60/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To support the primary analysis the following analyses were planned: 
 
analysis of CRB-ORR on the PPS excluding patients whose best overall response was unknown 
or missing 
  CRB-ORR performed on FAS 
 
sub-group analyses of ORR on both PPS and FAS by age and FLIPI score risk group 
  ORR based on investigator review for the PPS and FAS 
For the primary endpoint, subjects with missing endpoint information were considered non-responder. 
Time-to-event analyses were based on the Kaplan-Meier approach. For OS and PFS the median time 
(including its 90%-CI) was estimated for each treatment arm. In addition, the 25% and 75% 
percentiles were also provided for each treatment arm. Using the Kaplan-Meier methodology, the PFS 
and survival probabilities at 6, 12, 24, 30, and 36 months including their 90%-CIs were estimated. The 
hazard ratio between treatment arms was estimated from a Cox regression model with treatment as 
covariate and FLIPI score as stratification factor.  The associated 90% CI was also generated.  
Safety analyses 
Safety analyses were mainly based on the frequency of AEs and on the number of patients with 
laboratory values that fell outside the pre-determined ranges. Other safety data (e.g. vital signs, ECG) 
were summarized similarly. 
PK analyses 
Descriptive statistics stratified by treatment were presented for Cmax and Ctrough (pre-dose) during 
Cycles 1, 4, and 8 for Cohort 1patients. Furthermore, for Cycle 4 Day 1 Cmax, two-sided 90% CIs for 
the mean difference of Riximyo (test) versus MabThera (reference) on the logscale were calculated and 
the back-transformed point estimate as well as the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means were also 
provided (for descriptive purposes only). 
PD-analyses 
Summary statistics stratified for treatment and visit were presented for B-cell counts, absolute 
changes and percentage relative to baseline in CD19+ B-cell values. The depletion of peripheral B-cells 
was measured as the area under the effect-time curve (AUEC(0-21d)) of the percent peripheral B cell 
count relative to baseline up to the second infusion (i.e., Day 21 or Cycle 2 Day1). For AUEC0-21d, 
two-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference of Riximyo versus MabThera (test - reference) on the log-
scale was calculated and the backtransformed point estimate as well as the 90% CI for the ratio of 
geometric means was provided (for descriptive purposes only). 
Results 
Participant flow 
The planned number of randomised patients for this analysis was 618.  
However,  629  were  actually  randomised  (314  patients  to  the  Riximyo  arm  and  315  patients  to  the 
MabThera  arm;  two  Riximyo  patients  were  mis-randomised  and  were  discontinued  before  being 
treated).

Table 23 - Patients’ disposition in the Combination Treatment Phase (Study GP13-301) 
As of 10-Jul-2015 data cut-off date, 73.6% (n=231) of patients in the Riximyo arm and 73.3% 
(n=231) of patients in the MabThera arm entered the Maintenance Phase and received at least one 
dose of the maintenance treatment. A total of 303 patients were still receiving study treatment in the 
Maintenance Phase, 142 patients (61.5%) in the Riximyo arm and 161 patients (69.7%) in the 
MabThera arm. In the Maintenance Phase of the study, the primary reason for EOT (38.5% in Riximyo 
arm and 30.3% in MabThera arm) was disease progression (16.0% Riximyo; 10.8% MabThera) and 
“Treatment duration completed as per protocol” (15.2% Riximyo; 13.4% MabThera). 
Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 01-Dec-2011 (first patient screened) 
Study completion date: 09-Jul-2015 (last patient last visit in the combination treatment period) 
Study center(s): 174 centers screened patients and 159 centers randomized patients from centers in 
26 countries.  
Follow-Up period: 2.5 years (max. 3 years) 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 5 times, the original protocol and all amendments are provided: 
Amendment 1 (27-Feb-2012): the key purpose of this protocol amendment was to update and clearly 
define the attributes of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, revise the recommended dose 
modification per current clinical practice, and change the primary ORR analysis from local to Central 
Blinded Review of radiological response.  
Amendment 2 (17-Jan-2013) was a country specific amendment for Italy to change the schedule of 
treatment in the maintenance phase of the study from every 3 months to every 2 months as requested 
by Italian health authority. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 62/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 3 (21-Jan-2013) with the primary purpose to allow lymph node biopsy samples collected 
within 5 months of screening to establish and confirm the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma to confirm 
patient eligibility. Furthermore, the population PK of Riximyo and MabThera was removed in the 
amendment as this analysis was not deemed necessary to compare the PK of Riximyo and MabThera. 
Amendment 4 (26-Sep-2013), was a global amendment with the primary reason to add a planned 
interim analysis (based on specific health authority feedback) to support the regulatory filing of 
Riximyo with EMA and potentially other health authorities.  
Amendment 5 (10-Nov-2014). This amendment was based on Health Authority feedback received in 
February 2014, which lead to the removal of the planned interim analysis added in protocol 
amendment version 4.0. As of 20-Oct-2014, 561 patients were enrolled in the study.

Data sets analyzed 
Table 27 - Analysis sets by treatment (Randomized set) 
A total of 279 patients had at least one protocol deviation and these were balanced between the 
treatment arms: 137 patients (43.9%) in the Riximyo arm and 142 patients (45.1%) in the MabThera 
arm. These deviations were not believed to have introduced a bias in the efficacy or safety data 
comparisons between the two treatment arms. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results  
The ORR, based on the Modified Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma using central blinded 
review of the radiological response and liver/spleen enlargement assessments from the patients in the

PPS, was 87.1% in the Riximyo arm and 87.5% in the MabThera arm and the difference in ORRs was -
0.40% (95% CI [-5.94%, 5.14%]; 90% CI [-5.10%, 4.30%]). Equivalence was concluded as the 
entire 95% CI for the difference in ORR between the two treatments was within the pre-specified 
equivalence margin of ±12%. 
Of the 624 patients in the PPS 35 patients (5.6%; 19 Riximyo patients, 16 MabThera patients) had 
missing/unknown best overall response (BOR) based on central blinded review. When these patients 
were excluded from analysis, Overall response rate (CR or PR) was similar 0.55 (-4.03, 5.14) thus 
confirming previous findings.  Also, OR for FAS was similar with a difference of -0.44, (95% CI: 4.03, 
5.14). 
Table 28 - Primary efficacy analysis of overall response rate based on central blinded review 
(PPS) 
Table 29 - Overall response rate based on central blinded review of tumour assessment by 
treatment (FAS) 
Subgroup analyses of ORR were performed as supportive analyses to the primary analysis: 
Subgroup analyses of ORR by FLIPI score and age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years; PPS, FAS). Analyses 
according to age demonstrated similarity. However, the two arms were numerically different for ORR 
randomized by FLIPI strata, favoring MabThera (91.2% vs. 82.8% in Riximyo) in the subset of patients 
with a FLIPI score 0-2 (low-intermediate risk), and favoring Riximyo (90.4% vs. 84.7%) in the subset 
of patients with a FLIPI score 3-5 (high risk). 
Secondary efficacy results 
Best overall response (BOR) 
In general, the proportions of patients with BORs for the four categories were similar for the two 
treatment arms. The proportion of patients with BOR as ‘unknown’ was summarised by reason for the 
combination phase in the PPS and the FAS. In general, the reasons for an unknown response were 
balanced between the two treatment groups.

The median PFS was not reached for either of the two treatment groups. As of the time of data cutoff 
(10-Jul-2015), respectively 21.5% [n=67] and 16.5% [n=52] of patients in Riximyo and MabThera 
treatment arms progressed or died, with 62.5% [n=195] and 71.7% [n=226] patients censored 
without event and having adequate follow-up, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) estimate and its 
associated 90% CI are obtained by fitting Cox regression model with treatment allocation as covariate 
and FLIPI score as stratification factor. The PFS HR (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.33 (90% CI: [0.98, 
1.80]), based on the investigator assessment.  
Figure 15 - Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS by treatment based on investigator assessment (FAS) 
Ancillary analyses 
The PFS analysis was repeated with refined criteria for PFS events and censoring. 
PFS – Set 1 is defined using the following modified censoring rules: If patient has no event, the date 
is set as date of last adequate tumour assessment; If there is no adequate assessment, then the date 
is set as randomisation date; An adequate assessment is defined as an assessment with known overall 
response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD] or progressive disease 
[PD]). As of database cut-off, 10-Jul-2016, 91 of 312 (29.2%) patients in the Riximyo and 78 of 315 
(24.8%) patients in the MabThera treatment arms had a PFS event using the set 1 definition. The 
result of the sensitivity analysis of PFS following the set 1 rules with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (with 90% 
CI: [0.95, 1.58]).

PFS – Set 2 
PFS for set 2 is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to date of event which is defined as 
the first observation of disease progression (documented or without documentation of evidence of 
disease progression based on the investigator response), death, or start of another cancer therapy, 
using the following modified censoring rules: If patient has no event, the date is set as date of last 
adequate tumour assessment; If there is no adequate assessment (with known overall response CR, 
PR, SD or PD), then the date is set as randomisation date.

GAP analysis for PFS 
In order to assess the robustness of the random censoring mechanism for PFS, for censored patients, 
the gap between data cutoff date and last tumour assessment was assessed. 
The median gap time for PFS follow-up as compared to cut-off date in patients who were still followed-
up for efficacy between the Riximyo and MabThera groups was 3.2 months and 3.0 months, 
respectively. A minority of patients had a gap of more than one year between the data cutoff date and 
their last tumour assessment; 8.2% [n=20] and 5.7% [n=15] of censored patients in Riximyo and 
MabThera groups, respectively. 
For all patients, 30.3% and 25.4% of patients had less than 6 months and 6 to 12 months PFS follow-
up, respectively; these percentages were similar between the treatment groups. Considering that the 
majority of PFS events occurred during the Maintenance Phase, these figures are suggestive of 
immaturity of PFS data and should be taken into account when interpreting PFS results. 
OS 
At the time of data cutoff (10-July 2015), the number of deaths (18 events in the Riximyo group vs. 17 
events in the MabThera group) were similar between the two treatment arms.  
Table 34 - Analysis of OS using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression (FAS) 
The median OS has not yet been reached for either treatment group based on the currently available 
data. The analysis of OS using the Cox regression method showed that the HR was 1.03 (90% CI: 
0.59, 1.80).

*Originator is for GP13-201 study MabThera (data from Part I Week 52) and Rituxan (data from Part II 
Week 24) combined; for GP13-301 study originator is MabThera. 
Supportive study GP13-201 
Supportive efficacy data were obtained from study GP13-201, the pivotal PK/PD study conducted in 
adult patients with active RA (3rd line treatment- see also Clinical pharmacology section) 
The study consisted of a screening period (running from Visit 1 up to but not including Visit 3), an 
optional washout period between Visit 1 and Visit 2 for anti-TNF or DMARD, a baseline visit (Visit 2) to 
reassess the RA status and associated laboratory testing in order to confirm eligibility of the patient 
and to perform a complete disease activity assessment. Visit 3 (Day 1) consisted of randomisation and 
first study drug administration. 
On Week 24 after the first infusion, patients who were considered responders (defined as having a 
decrease in Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and if they had at least residual active disease (DAS28 ≥ 
2.6) were re-treated with a second course of treatment (either 1000 mg i.v. Riximyo or MabThera on 
two separate occasions, 2 weeks apart) up to Week 52 at the discretion of the investigator. Patients 
who received this second course of treatment had a safety, efficacy and PD assessment performed 26 
weeks after the first infusion of the second course of study medication. 
The primary objective was to assess the PK bioequivalence between Riximyo and MabThera in 
combination with MTX. Secondary objectives also included several efficacy parameters:

Efficacy Results Study GP13-201 
A total of, 173 patients were randomised, of which 86 patients received Riximyo and 87 patients 
received MabThera. The majority of randomised patients (82.1%) completed up to 52 weeks. About 
65% of the subjects were re-treated in period following Week 24. In total 6 patients were excluded 
from the per-protocol set, because of major protocol violations (not meeting inclusion criteria, 
receiving wrong study drug and missing CRP measurements).  
Baseline demographics and disease severity were comparable for the Riximyo and MabThera treatment 
groups, and reflected the intended target population. The majority of patients were female (86.1%) 
and Caucasian (80.9%). The mean age of all patients was 53.7 years and 20.8% of patients were ≥65 
years of age. The mean duration of RA was 10.07 years (range: 1.0 to 34.0 years). All patients had 
previously been treated with 1-3 anti-TNFs or other biologic DMARDs, in line with the protocol inclusion 
criteria. The mean DAS28 (CRP) scores at baseline were 5.81 (SD=0.92) and 5.85 (SD=0.88), in the 
Riximyo and MabThera groups, respectively, indicating moderate-severe disease activity.  
In both treatment groups, the DAS28 scores improved significantly form baseline (see Figure 21 
below). The mean changes from baseline were comparable between Riximyo and MabThera. The upper 
limit of the 95% CI of the difference between both groups was 0.462, below the pre-defined non-
inferiority criterion of 0.6.

The ACR20 (CRP) response rates at Week 24 were 71.8% and 72.4% in the Riximyo and MabThera 
group, respectively. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in response rates was -14.74%, 
above the pre-defined equivalence margin of -15.0%.

Retreatment (i.e. a second treatment course), occurred in about 65% of the participants (59 in 
Riximyo arm, and 60 in the MabThera arm), after on average 232.8 (SD62.1) days and 241.5 
(SD64.4) days, respectively. Beyond B-cells levels and ADA (anti-drug-antibody), no clinical outcomes 
were reported after retreatment.

Design 
GP13-201 
This is a 52-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, study designed to assess the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy of Riximyo and MabThera® in 
patients with RA refractory or intolerant to one or up to three anti-TNF therapies.  
Study Part I design: Patients received their first course of treatment (study drug infusion 
on two separate occasions, two weeks apart) and were followed for 52 weeks. After 
Week 24, responders (defined as having a decrease in DAS28 derived either with ESR or 
CRP of > 1.2 from baseline) could be re-treated with study medication at the discretion 
of the investigator, if they had at least residual active disease (DAS28 ≥ 2.6).

Primary objective: Bioequivalence between Riximyo and MabThera (PK) 
Secondary objective:  
  Non-inferiority of Riximyo to MabThera with respect to: 
  Change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) disease activity score at Week 24 (using 
a mixed model for repeated measures). The upper bound of the 95% 
confidence limit for the mean difference between Riximyo and MabThera was to 
be equal or less than 0.6 in order to conclude equivalence.  
  ACR20 (CRP) response rate at Week 24 (estimated based on pooled standard 
error and chi-square statistics). The lower bound of the 95% confident limit was

For the key secondary efficacy endpoint change from baseline in DAS28 at Week 
24 (using CRP for the calculation), a mixed model for repeated measures was 
used, to estimate both mean change from baseline at Week 24 and the 
averaged change between Week 4 and 24. Two-sided 95% Cl for the mean 
difference between Riximyo and MabThera were derived and compared to the 
pre-specified margin of 0.6. The upper limit of the CI was required to be equal 
to or less than 0.6 in order to claim equivalence. 
Analysis of other secondary variables: 
A two-sided 95% CI for the difference in both the ACR20 (CRP) response rates 
at Week 24 was estimated based on the pooled standard error and chi-square 
statistic. The lower bound of the confidence limit must be greater than -0.15 or 
-15.0% in order to conclude equivalence. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose response studies are not required for biosimilar products. For the justification of the dose, a 
reference is made to the dossier of the originator. 
In  the  pivotal  study  GP13-301,  the  choice  of  the  study  population  of  patients  with  advanced  stage 
Follicular lymphoma to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence is supported as this is the most common 
of  the  approved  oncology  indications  of  MabThera.  Moreover,  the  additive  treatment  effect  to  a 
background  therapy  of  CVP  is  expected  to  be  reasonable  large  in  this  population  based  on  historical 
data, indicating that FL is a sensitive model to detect differences between the biosimilar and originator 
product.  
The parallel, two-arm, randomised study was adequately designed. The ORR, determined by central 
reading, is considered a relevant primary endpoint for this indication. The equivalence margin of +/- 
12% is considered acceptable from a clinical perspective. This margin is below the 95% CI of the 
treatment effect of the main study of the reference product in this indication. In the placebo-controlled 
study of the originator, the ORR was 81% for the MabThera-CVP arm and 57% for CVP + placebo arm, 
with a treatment effect of 24% (95% CI: 14%, 34%). Moreover, the choice of 12% margin is also 
supported by the indirect confidence interval approach, which was calculated to be 13.4% by the 
Applicant, in accordance the EMA Guidance Choice of Non-inferiority Margin. The missing data 
imputation of the ORR measures by considering missing data as non-responders, is considered 
appropriate.  
Efficacy was a secondary endpoint in Study GP13-201 in RA patients, which was powered and designed 
to establish bio-equivalence of PK as primary objective. As the study was not powered to establish 
non-inferiority (or equivalence) of efficacy, the data on therapeutic endpoints should be considered as 
supportive.  
In RA, the regular maintenance dosing schedule is every 24 weeks (6 months). Treatment continuation 
with a second course of the study drugs after 24 weeks and the timing of a second course was to be 
individually decided by the prescriber, based on the level of residual disease activity. Therefore, the 
Assessment report

Page 79/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data sampling from the second part of the study was more variable, hampering firm conclusions 
regarding long-term efficacy after Week 24. The decision making regarding re-treatment was in line 
with the posology of MabThera and SAWP recommendations.  
The choice of mean change from baseline of DAS28 as ‘key’ secondary endpoints, instead of ACR20 
responder rate as originally proposed in the Scientific Advice in 2011, is supported, as continuous 
endpoints may be more sensitive to evaluate therapeutic equivalence than dichotomous ones. The NI 
margin of 0.6 points is agreed, as it is based on clinical grounds, i.e. a change of DAS28 score of 0.6 is 
considered a minimal clinically relevant change. For another secondary endpoint, ACR20, the NI 
margin was set at +/- 15%. The cut-off of 15% was based on meta-analysis of other RA studies 
showing a difference of ACR20 of 31% (95% CI 25%, 38%) between rituximab and MTX. The 15% 
equivalence limit is approximately half of this effect size, and is below the lower limit of the 95% CI. 
The 15% margin is considered relatively high from a clinical perspective. However, it is acceptable in 
this context. No imputation of missing data was applied for the efficacy outcomes, and the analyses 
were performed in the Per-Protocol set. Considering the exploratory character of the study regarding 
the clinical efficacy endpoints and that the study was not powered for establishing equivalence of 
efficacy in RA, this is accepted.  
A high frequency of minor protocol deviations was reported for both studies; most frequently reported 
minor protocol deviations being “PK sample out of visit window or missing” (96.5%), “scheduled visits 
out of the defined time window” (59.5%), “blood pressure measurement not performed per protocol” 
(18.5%), and “premedication not administered per protocol” (16.8%). It is not expected that critical 
findings of GCP Inspection of one site would have largely influenced the study outcomes, given the 
small number of subject involved, and that three other sites were considered GCP-compliant.    
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
GP13-301 (pivotal efficacy trial) 
The demographics were largely similar between the treatment arms in terms of age, gender, race, or 
other demographic parameters. Patients treated with Riximyo were slightly more likely older, more 
female, Caucasian (and not Asian), with better ECOG but only with minor differences.  Regarding 
disease history there is a slight increase of patients with bulky or stage 4 disease in the Mabthera 
treated group. 
The ORR was 87.1% in the Riximyo arm and 87.5% in the MabThera arm and the difference in ORRs 
was -0.40% (95% CI [-5.94%, 5.14%]; 90% CI [-5.10%, 4.30%]). Equivalence was concluded as the 
entire 95% CIs for the difference in ORR between the two treatments was within the pre-specified 
equivalence margin of ±12%. Thus, the primary endpoint was met. This was further supported by pre-
defined sensitivity analyses. 
Subgroup analyses according to age demonstrated similarity. However, the two arms were numerically 
different for ORR randomized by FLIPI strata, favoring MabThera (91.2% vs. 82.8% in Riximyo) in the 
subset of patients with a FLIPI score 0-2 (low-intermediate risk), and favoring Riximyo (90.4% vs. 
84.7%) in the subset of patients with a FLIPI score 3-5 (high risk). However, an analysis of PFS and 
OS according to FLIPI score did not reveal major differences with regards to outcome between the 
treatment arms. 
In general, the proportions of patients with best overall response (BOR) for the four categories (CR, 
PR, SD and PD) were similar. The results of the sensitivity analysis repeated using the FAS were 
consistent with those seen in the PPS.

Notably, the rate of Complete Remission (about 14%) was significant lower in Study 301 than reported 
before for other trials (Marcus: 30%, Federico: 67%). This might be explained by differences in the 
study populations. Patients in the Study GP13-301 had a higher risk at baseline (FLIPI 3 score -5 in 
56% of patients), than in the historical trials (22-38%) The CR rate was assessed and confirmed by 
central review, which was not the case with public available CR rates from historical trials where only 
CR rates from local reading are available. Thus, the CR outcomes of Study GP13-301 met more 
stringent criteria; however, the CR rates were balanced between both treatment arms of Study GP13-
301, and the overall response (ORR) is high and similar. Assay sensitivity could still be assumed 
despite the relative low CR rates, as the overall ORR is in the same range as reported before, and 
response might be even lower in populations at higher risks –providing a potential larger treatment 
effect.  
When comparing best overall response based on investigator versus central blinded review it was 
observed that for 114 patients who had a CR as per investigator, the central review confirmed only 52 
as a CR and 58 as a PR with a few results being determined as SD, PD and unknown. However, this 
discrepancy is not viewed as important since (a) primary analyses were conducted under central 
review, (b) the discrepancy is only one stage category and (c) even with this difference the primary 
endpoint is ORR which is the sum of both CR + PR. However, such discrepant findings may impact on 
the PFS analysis, which was conducted as secondary analysis and by investigator review only (see 
further below).  
PFS was based on investigator assessment. The median PFS was not reached for either of the two 
treatment groups. As of the time of data cutoff (10-Jul-2015), respectively 21.5% [n=67] and 16.5% 
[n=52] of patients in Riximyo and MabThera treatment arms progressed or died, with 62.5% [n=195] 
and 71.7% [n=226] patients censored without event and having adequate follow-up, respectively. The 
majority of these patients were still ongoing after the Combination Treatment Phase so their eventual 
PFS outcomes in the study may still potentially alter the PFS curve of either treatment arm beyond 6 
months.  
The PFS HR (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.33 (90% CI: [0.98, 1.80]), based on the investigator 
assessment indicating that PFS may deviate between assignments in the treatment maintenance 
phase, not in favour of Riximyo (data cut-off 10-Jul-2015). It has to be taken into consideration that 
the study is not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence of PFS. With the PFS update of 10-
Jul-2016 the hazard ratio is 1.25 (with 90% CI: [0.96, 1.61]) thus decreasing with an increase in 
number of events over time. The median follow-up time was 18.15 months for the Riximyo group and 
22.80 months for the MabThera group. The median PFS could not yet be estimated for either treatment 
group based on the currently available data. Considering that the majority of PFS events occurred 
during the Maintenance Phase, these figures are still suggestive of immaturity of PFS data. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed on the PFS in the ongoing monotherapy maintenance treatment phase. The 
landmark analyses, selecting patients who were at risk of progression at the time of entrance of the 
maintenance phase –i.e. those patients without progression in the first combination-therapy study 
phase-, showed similar outcomes as the ITT FAS analyses. Refined criteria for PFS events and 
censoring did not lead to different conclusions. When exploring differences of time-interference for 
either treatment, using Kaplan-Meier estimates up to the time point of the last event occurred, a 
statistically significant difference in PFS was observed after 24 months between Riximyo and 
MabThera, but no statistically significant differences were noted at other time-points. However, Month 
24 is only covering a third of the enrolled study population, and the data were too immature for final 
conclusions on differences in time-interference. In the updated submission (data cut off: 31-Dec-2016) 
the number of PFS events was still low and the rate of censoring high. The divergence between the two 
KM curves has not decreased with these updated data. The PFS HR (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.31 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 81/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(90% CI [1.02, 1.69]), in the same range as observed with the first PFS analysis (data cut off: 10-Jul-
2016) thus in line with the PFS findings from the 1st PFS interim analysis. The follow-up time is still too 
short to allow for an estimation of median PFS.  
The divergence is considered due to patient heterogeneity or random data variation rather than a real 
treatment effect; the study was not powered to demonstrate similarity (nor to detect a difference) in 
PFS between the products, and that the PFS results should be interpreted with caution.  Moreover, the 
potential PFS difference is not reflected by an effect in CR rates at various time points (month 15, 27, 
33 and at end of study). CR has been shown to correlate with OS (even as surrogate marker when 
measured at week 30) whereas PFS has not. [Shi Q, Flowers CR, Hiddemann W et al (2017); Thirty-
months complete response as a surrogate end point in first-line follicular lymphoma therapy: An 
individual patient-level analysis of multiple randomized trials. J Clin Oncol 35(5): 552-560]. 
Furthermore, the interpretability of the PFS results is hampered by the study design (PFS assessment 
at only 6 month time interval, and no planned assessment for disease progression beyond 3 years 
follow up), the immaturity of the data, the high level of censoring (70% of the patients with main 
reason for censoring “adequate assessment no longer available”, ~50% of censored patients), and 
median follow up time of less than 2 years.  
As of July 2015, the number of deaths (18 events [5.8%] in the Riximyo group vs. 17 events [5.4%] in 
the MabThera group) were similar between the two treatment arms. The median OS has not yet been 
reached for either treatment group based on the currently available data. The analysis of OS using the 
Cox regression method showed that the HR was 1.03 (90% CI: 0.59, 1.80) at July 2015 and with the 
data update from 15-Jul-2016 the HR for OS changed to 0.78 and to 0.77 (90% CI: [0.49, 1.22]) at 
data cut off: 31-Dec-2016. The analysis of overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression 
method for the PPS was consistent with the findings for the FAS. The currently observed data are still 
premature and cannot meaningfully contribute to the biosimilarity assessment. Updated PFS and OS 
data are to be expected with the next planned update (see RMP). 
GP13-201 (efficacy data in RA) 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24. The least 
square (LS) mean difference between Riximyo and MabThera in the change from baseline in DAS28 
(CRP) at Week 24 was 0.07 (95% CI -0.328, 0.462). The upper limit of the corresponding 95% CI was 
0.462, which is below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.6. Thus, the criterion for non-
inferiority was met. 
The mean difference between Riximyo and MabThera in the averaged change from baseline in DAS28 
(CRP) between Weeks 4 and 24 was 0.33 (95% CI 0.029, 0.639). The upper limit of the corresponding 
95% CI was 0.639, slightly above the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.6; indicating a marginal 
difference compared to MabThera. However, the results do not indicate clinically relevant differences 
between both treatment groups. Analysis of DAS 28 per visit by treatment group suggests similarity. 
Mean DAS28 (CRP) was numerically lower for the MabThera treatment arm compared to Riximyo until 
Week 24. After Week 24, a reverse trend was observed up to Week 52. Both treatment arms, 
however, exhibit a large degree of variation at all timepoints as shown by the wide SD markers. Post-
hoc analysis showed no clear trend for DAS28 with regards to Cmax, suggesting that the observed 
variability in Cmax had no influence on efficacy in either of the treatment arms. 
The mean profiles for both Riximyo batches lie at the upper end, meaning less mean change of DAS 28  
from baseline, consistent with the observation in the primary analysis of DAS28 (change from week 4 
to 24) and more pronounced in the average change from week 4 to 24. However, both Riximyo 
batches lie within the range of mean profiles for different MabThera batches. For all batches, there is a 
degree of variability in the mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) profiles.

The ACR20 (CRP) response rates at Week 24 were similar for the two treatment groups (71.8% and 
72.4% in the Riximyo and MabThera groups, respectively). The lower bound of the 95% CI for the 
difference in response rates was -14.74%, above the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -15.0%. 
Further analyses for ACR20 (CRP) were conducted (averaged ACR20 (CRP) responder estimate 
between Week 4 and 24; averaged ACR20 (CRP) at week 24). All analyses show that MabThera and 
Riximyo are similar regarding ACR20 rates with when applying equivalence margins of ±15%. 
The difference between ACR20 (CRP) scores at different time points -except for weeks 16 and 38-, with 
a confidence interval contained within +/- equivalence margins, were discussed but were not viewed as 
clinically meaningful. In addition, slight differences were observed up to and including week 16 
(ACR50, ACR70) or up to and including week 24 (SDAI/CDAI). The differences in efficacy scores/values 
between Riximyo and Mabthera among weeks 4 to 24 are decreasing with the data update (cut-off 10-
Jul-2015) and were not supported by the comparisons to the US product Rituxan to which bridging of 
data has been made. 
In overall, results from the ACR20 response analysis at week 24 and averaged ACR20 responders 
between week 4 and week 24 showed that Riximyo and MabThera are similar regarding ACR20 rates 
with when applying equivalence margins of ±15%.in study GP13-201 the criterion for non-inferiority in 
terms of the key secondary efficacy endpoint change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24- was 
met.  
Demonstrating equivalence of efficacy in both a model of the haematology-oncology and for the RA 
indication, the most common of the immunology indications, supports the extrapolation to the non-
studied oncology and immunology indications, together with the evidence from functional assays and 
PK-PD studies.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and biosimilarity to Mabthera has been demonstrated in an adequately designed randomised 
study, 627 patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) as regards ORR (supported by 
sensitivity analyses in the FAS population) and BOR. Efficacy and biosimilarity to Mabthera has been 
shown in a supportive study in patients with RA. 
The efficacy outcomes of the confirmatory study in FL and the exploratory study in RA support 
extrapolation to the other non-studied oncology and immunology indications.

Table 41 - Safety data set 
Patient exposure 
A total of 404 patients (86 RA patients and 318 NHL patients; 87.1 Patients’Years (PY)) have been 
exposed to Riximyo in studies GP13-201, GP13-301 and GP13-101. 
Prolonged treatment continuation of Riximyo up to a maximum 2.5 years was applied in 231 patients 
with Follicular Lymphoma. The maintenance treatment part of Study GP13-301 is still ongoing. At the 
cut-off  date  of  data  sampling,  about  50%  of  the  study  population  had  received  at  least  4  cycles  of 
Riximyo/MabThera. Total exposure to Riximyo was 476.4 PY at cut-off of 10 July 2015.

Pooling of safety data of these studies is not considered meaningful, considering the differences in 
rituximab standard treatment regimen between oncology and auto-immune indications, which is by far 
more intensive for NHL than for RA. Moreover, there are differences in background risks of the 
patients’ populations and their concurrent therapies, which chemotherapy in NHL and methotrexate in 
RA. Therefore, the safety outcomes are discussed separately for each clinical study in this report.

Adverse events 
GP13-201 
The overall incidence of AEs was comparable for the two treatment groups (Riximyo: 56 patients, 
65.1% vs. MabThera: 57 patients, 65.5%) with no clinically meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups for any SOC. 
The most commonly affected primary SOC was infections and infestations (33.5% overall). This is in 
line with earlier studies with MabThera. The next 2 most commonly affected primary SOCs were 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (17.3% overall) and gastrointestinal disorders (16.2% 
overall). 
The most common AEs overall included urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, (worsening of) 
rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, and bronchitis. Urinary tract 
infection occurred more often in the Riximyo group (10.5%) compared with the MabThera group 
(5.7%). None of the AEs of urinary tract infection in the Riximyo group were serious, all were mild in 
severity (except for one moderate), and all resolved. This was further addressed in the response to 
Q89. There were otherwise no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups for any 
of the most frequently occurring AEs. 
Table 44 - Summary of AE categories in patients with RA – GP13-201 (Safety Analysis Set) 
AEs suspected to be related to study drug based on investigator assessment occurred equally between 
the two treatment groups (Riximyo 28 patients; 32.6%, MabThera 29 patients, 33.3%).  
The most common suspected drug-related AEs were related to infections and infestations with 
comparable incidence between the two treatment groups (Riximyo 13 patients, 15.1%; MabThera 15 
patients, 17.2%). The next most common AEs were related to Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (Riximyo 2 patients, 2.3%; MabThera 7 patients, 8%), vascular disorders (Riximyo 4 
patients, 4.7%; MabThera 4 patients, 4.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (Riximyo 2 patients, 2.3%; 
MabThera 6 patients, 6.9%) and general disorders and administrative site conditions (Riximyo seven 
patients, 8.1%; MabThera one patient, 1.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 86/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The five most common AEs rated to have a relationship to study drug overall were urinary tract 
infection (4%), nasopharyngitis (3.5%), hypertension (2.9%), infusion related reaction (2.9%) and 
pruritus (2.9%). There was a higher rate of urinary tract infections for Riximyo in comparison to 
MabThera (10.5 versus 5.7%). In contrast, the overall rates of pruritus and infections were slightly 
higher for MabThera. For the latter this was attributed to a higher rate of respiratory tract infections 
(bronchitis: Riximyo 3.5%, MabThera 5.7%; upper respiratory tract infection: Riximyo 3.5%, 
MabThera 5.7%; cough: Riximyo 2.3%, MabThera 4.6%; respiratory tract infection: Riximyo none, 
MabThera 3.4%). 
GP13-301 
Combination Phase 
The rate and severity of adverse events was considerable higher for FL versus RA patients. This is to 
be expected considering the more frequent rituximab treatment regimen of 8 dosing cycles within 6 
months, as compared to a 24 weeks dosing regimen in RA, and the combination with CVP in FL 
treatment. 
The overall incidence of AEs during the combination phase was similar in both treatment groups 
(Riximyo -CVP: 92.6%; MabThera-CVP 91.4%). The most commonly (>30% incidence in either 
treatment group) affected primary SOCs were gastrointestinal disorders (primarily constipation and 
nausea), nervous system disorders (primarily peripheral neuropathy, and paraesthesia) and infections 
and infestations (primarily urinary tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection). 
Different than in the RA study, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy/paraesthesia, fatigue and 
nausea/constipation or abdominal pain were frequently reported in the FL study population, with 
frequencies over 10%. In comparison, in the RA study only one case of neutropenia was reported (in 
the MabThera arm), and a low frequency of fatigue (2.4%), abdominal pain (1.7%) and paraesthesia 
(1.2%). These differences are probably due to CVP co-treatment or other co-medications (like opioids), 
and/or differences in the rituximab treatment schedule, or the disease itself.  
The only AE reported with at least a 5% absolute difference and more frequently in the Riximyo group 
than in the MabThera group was peripheral neuropathy (15.1% vs. 9.5%, respectively). The only AE 
reported with at least a 5% absolute difference and occurring more frequently in the MabThera group 
compared to the Riximyo group was paraesthesia (14.3% vs. 8.3%), although it must be noted that 
peripheral neuropathy and paresthesia are essentially the same and taken together, the combined 
incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy and paraesthesia is similar between the treatment groups (i.e., 
Riximyo with 15.1% + 8.3% = 23.4% vs. MabThera with 9.5% + 14.3% = 23.8%). 
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs were similar between the two treatment groups (Riximyo grade 3 
40.7%, grade 4 12.5%; MabThera grade 3 41.9%, grade 4 14.9%).

Table 45 - Summary of AE categories in patients with FL – GP13-301 Combination Phase 
(Safety Set) 
In the Combination Phase, AEs considered as study drug-related were reported by 230 (73.7%) 
Riximyo and 223 (70.8%) MabThera patients. These events were primarily grade 1 (mild) or 2 
(moderate).  The most common AEs were neutropenia, constipation and infusion-related reactions. 
Maintenance Phase 
During the Maintenance Phase, AEs were reported by 63.2% in the Riximyo group and by 57.1% in the 
MabThera group. With the data update this percentage difference decreased from 6.1% to 1.6%. The 
most commonly affected (>15% incidence in either treatment group) primary SOCs were infections 
and infestations (primarily upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (primarily arthralgia and back pain), gastrointestinal 
disorders (primarily diarrhea and vomiting), and general disorders and administration site conditions 
(primarily asthenia and pyrexia). Six AEs occurred with a frequency of >5% in either treatment group. 
While neutropenia and cough occurred more frequently in the Riximyo group, the other common AEs 
occurred more frequently in the MabThera group. 
The incidence of grade 3 AEs were similar between the two treatment groups (Riximyo 13.9%; 
MabThera 13.0%), while there were more grade 4 AEs occurring in the Riximyo group (12 patients, 
5.2%) compared to the MabThera group (4 patients, 1.7%). Neutropenia was the only AE that was 
reported to occur at a greater than 2% frequency (Riximyo, grade 3/4 in 17 patients [7.4%] 
MabThera, grade 3/4 in nine patients [3.9%]). However, this difference was not accompanied by a 
higher number of febrile neutropenia or infections (SOC infections and infestations - Riximyo: 32.7%; 
Mabthera: 36.5%, cut-off 10-Jul-2016).

In the Maintenance Phase, AEs considered as study drug-related were reported by 54 (23.4%) Riximyo 
and 38 (16.5%) MabThera patients. These events were primarily grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate). 
There were 16 (6.9%) Riximyo and 12 (5.2%) MabThera patients reporting drug-related grade 3/4 
AEs. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
GP13-201 
Overall, the number of patients with SAEs was comparable for the two treatment groups with no 
clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups (Riximyo: 10 patients (11.6%) vs. 
MabThera: 14 patients (16.1%)). SAEs were reported most often in the infections and infestations 
SOC: 5 (5.8%) patients in the Riximyo group and 4 (4.6%) patients in the MabThera group. 
SAEs judged by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug were reported overall in 3 (3.5%) 
patients in the Riximyo group and 6 (6.9%) patients in the MabThera group. The most common of 
these were reported in the infections and infestations SOC: 3 (3.5%) patients in the Riximyo group 
(abscess, groin abscess, Klebsiella sepsis, and soft tissue infection) and 2 (2.3%) patients in the 
MabThera group (atypical pneumonia and pneumonia haemophilus). 
The proportions of patients with other non-fatal SAEs or who discontinued study treatment due to AEs 
were generally comparable for the two treatment groups. 
One patient in the Riximyo group died during the study due to a treatment-emergent adverse event of 
multi-organ failure after an accidental overdose of MTX (daily dose instead of weekly intake). As this 
event occurred 18 weeks after the first course of treatment, causality seems unlikely.  
GP13-301 
Combination Phase 
During the Combination Phase, the incidence of SAEs was similar between the Riximyo (71 patients, 
22.8%) and MabThera (63 patients, 20.0%) groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 89/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the SOC of blood and lymphatic disorders, SAEs were reported for 23 (7.4%) Riximyo and 17 
(5.4%) MabThera patients. The SAE of infusion-related reaction occurred in three Riximyo patients and 
one MabThera patients. For infections and infestations, the number of patients with an SAE was equal 
(21 patients each, 6.7%) for both treatment groups. 
The incidence of individual SAEs was <5% in either treatment group; the majority of reported SAEs 
occurred in one or two patients. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (Riximyo 4.8%; 
MabThera 2.9%), pyrexia (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 2.2%), abdominal pain (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 
1.9%), neutropenia (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 1.6%), and sepsis (Riximyo 0.6%; MabThera 1.6%). 
The incidence of study drug-related SAEs was similar between the Riximyo (32 patients, 10.3%) and 
MabThera (25 patients, 7.9%) groups. The incidence of specific SAEs was <4% for either treatment 
group. The most common related SAE was febrile neutropenia (Riximyo 11 patients, 3.5%; MabThera 
9 patients, 2.9%). Differences between treatment groups for specific SAEs were <1%. 
Maintenance Phase 
During the Maintenance Phase, the incidence of SAEs was low and slightly higher for Riximyo (14 
patients, 6.1%) than for MabThera (10 patients, 4.3%). This difference also decreased with the data 
update from 10-Jul-2016 (20 [7.9%] for Riximyo and 18 [7.1%] for MabThera). The incidence of 
individual SAEs was <1% for both treatment groups. The types of SAEs reported were similar between 
the two treatment groups. The SOC with the highest reported number of SAEs was infections and 
infestations (7 patients Riximyo; 6 patients MabThera). The causes of SAE were very diverse, and no 
clear pattern emerged 
• 
Deaths 
Mortality rates were similar between both treatments throughout Study GP13-301. During the entire 
study for all phases combined (Combination, Maintenance, and Posttreatment), 35 (5.6%) patients 
died (18 [5.8%] in the Riximyo group and 17 [5.4%] in the MabThera group). The most common 
cause of death during the study was Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma in both treatment arms, eight (2.6%) 
in the Riximyo group and six (1.9%) in the MabThera group. 
During the Maintenance Phase, 4 patients died (2 in the Riximyo group and 2 in the MabThera group. 
These cases were not considered related to rituximab treatment.  
Adverse events of special interest 
GP13-201 
The overall incidence of AEs considered to be of special interest was comparable for the two treatment 
groups (24.4% vs. 25.3%) with no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups for 
any SOC. The two most commonly reported AEs of special interest were rheumatoid arthritis (Riximyo 
4 patients, 4.7%; MabThera 5 patients, 5.7%) and hypertension (Riximyo 3 patients, 3.5%; MabThera 
5 patients, 5.7%). 
• 
Infusion-related reactions 
The numbers of patients who reported at least one IRR at any time during the observation period 
overall was 32 (37.2%) patients in the Riximyo group and 37 (42.5%) patients in the MabThera group. 
The most common of these IRRs were hypertension (4.6% overall), back pain (4% overall), headache 
(4% overall), nausea (4% overall), and pruritus (4% overall). 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 90/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of potential infusion related reactions with suspected causal relationship to the study 
drug was similar between both treatment groups (Riximyo: 18 patients, 20.9%; MabThera: 19 
patients, 21.8%). 
Infusion related reactions occurring on the day or the day after the infusion were considered to be 
potentially hyper-acute or acute infusion reactions. After the first infusion, such events occurred in a 
total of 24 (13.9%) patients (Riximyo: 10 patients, 11.6%; MabThera: 14 patients, 16.1%). After the 
second infusion, fewer events of potential infusion related reactions occurred on the day or the day 
after the infusion, i.e. in a total of 11 (6.4%) patients (Riximyo: 4 patients, 4.7%; MabThera: 7 
patients, 8.0%). Despite the numerical differences, no clinically relevant differences were noted 
between the groups. 
GP13-301 
For study GP13-301, cytokine release syndrome and PML were defined as AEs of special interest in the 
clinical study protocol. No PML occurred during the study. During Combination Phase, cytokine release 
syndrome occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients during the Maintenance Phase. 
• 
Infusion-related reactions 
Combination Phase 
During the Combination Phase of study GP13-301, the frequency of patients experiencing the AE 
“infusion related reaction” with suspected relationship to study drug was similar between both 
treatment groups (Riximyo: 13.1%, grade 3 or 4 1.0%; MabThera: 11.7%, grade 3 or 4 0.6%).  
The frequency of patients experiencing the AE “infusion related reaction” requiring study drug dose 
adjustments or temporary interruptions during the Combination Phase was also similar in both 
treatment arms (Riximyo: 6.7%, grade 3 or 4 1.0%; MabThera: 7.0%, grade 3 or 4 0.6%). 
One patient in each treatment arm discontinued the treatment due to the AE “infusion related reaction” 
during the Combination Phase. SAEs of infusion related reactions with suspected causal relationship to 
study drug were reported with a frequency of 1.0 % in patients treated with Riximyo and of 0.3% 
treated with MabThera during the Combination Phase. 
Maintenance Phase 
During the Maintenance Phase of GP13-301, the frequency of potential infusion related reactions with 
suspected causal relationship to study treatment was similar between the Riximyo (10.8%) and 
MabThera (8.2%) groups.  
The most frequently reported AEs related to infusion related reactions (i.e. >1% of patients in either 
treatment group) were infusion related reaction (Riximyo: 1.3%; MabThera: 1.3%), cough (Riximyo: 
2.2%; MabThera: none), thrombocytopenia (Riximyo: 0.4%; MabThera: 1.3%), and arthralgia 
(Riximyo: none; MabThera: 1.3%). Other infusion related reactions were reported by 1 or 2 patients in 
either treatment group, with a similar frequency and pattern. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
GP13-201 
Overall, the number of patients with SAEs was comparable for the two treatment groups with no 
clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups (Riximyo: 10 patients (11.6%) vs. 
MabThera: 14 patients (16.1%)). SAEs were reported most often in the infections and infestations 
SOC: 5 (5.8%) patients in the Riximyo group and 4 (4.6%) patients in the MabThera group.

SAEs judged by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug were reported overall in 3 (3.5%) 
patients in the Riximyo group and 6 (6.9%) patients in the MabThera group. The most common of 
these were reported in the infections and infestations SOC: 3 (3.5%) patients in the Riximyo group 
(abscess, groin abscess, Klebsiella sepsis, and soft tissue infection) and 2 (2.3%) patients in the 
MabThera group (atypical pneumonia and pneumonia haemophilus). 
The proportions of patients with other non-fatal SAEs or who discontinued study treatment due to AEs 
were generally comparable for the two treatment groups. 
One patient in the R group died during the study due to a treatment-emergent adverse event of multi-
organ failure after an accidental overdose of MTX (daily dose instead of weekly intake). As this event 
occurred 18 weeks after the first course of treatment, causality seems unlikely.  
GP13-301 
Combination Phase 
During the Combination Phase, the incidence of SAEs was similar between the Riximyo (71 patients, 
22.8%) and MabThera (63 patients, 20.0%) groups. 
In the SOC of blood and lymphatic disorders, SAEs were reported for 23 (7.4%) Riximyo and 17 
(5.4%) MabThera patients. The SAE of infusion-related reaction occurred in three Riximyo patients and 
one MabThera patients. For infections and infestations, the number of patients with an SAE was equal 
(21 patients each, 6.7%) for both treatment groups. 
The incidence of individual SAEs was <5% in either treatment group; the majority of reported SAEs 
occurred in one or two patients. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (Riximyo 4.8%; 
MabThera 2.9%), pyrexia (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 2.2%), abdominal pain (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 
1.9%), neutropenia (Riximyo 1.3%; MabThera 1.6%), and sepsis (Riximyo 0.6%; MabThera 1.6%). 
The incidence of study drug-related SAEs was similar between the Riximyo (32 patients, 10.3%) and 
MabThera (25 patients, 7.9%) groups. The incidence of specific SAEs was <4% for either treatment 
group. The most common related SAE was febrile neutropenia (Riximyo 11 patients, 3.5%; MabThera 
9 patients, 2.9%). Differences between treatment groups for specific SAEs were <1%. 
Maintenance Phase 
During the Maintenance Phase, the incidence of SAEs was low and slightly higher for Riximyo (14 
patients, 6.1%) than for MabThera (10 patients, 4.3%). This difference also decreased with the data 
update from 10-Jul-2016 (20 [7.9%] for Riximyo and 18 [7.1%] for MabThera). The incidence of 
individual SAEs was <1% for both treatment groups. The types of SAEs reported were similar between 
the two treatment groups. The SOC with the highest reported number of SAEs was infections and 
infestations (7 patients Riximyo; 6 patients MabThera). The causes of SAE were very diverse, and no 
clear pattern emerged 
• 
Deaths 
Mortality rates were similar between both treatments throughout Study GP13-301. During the entire 
study for all phases combined (Combination, Maintenance, and Posttreatment), 35 (5.6%) patients 
died (18 [5.8%] in the GP2013 group and 17 [5.4%] in the MabThera group). The most common cause 
of death during the study was Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma in both treatment arms, eight (2.6%) in the 
Riximyo group and six (1.9%) in the MabThera group.During the Maintenance Phase, 4 patients died 
(2 in the Riximyo group and 2 in the MabThera group). These cases were not considered related to 
rituximab treatment.

Laboratory findings 
GP13-201 
The incidence of clinically notable and newly occurred hematology values as well as values in clinical 
chemistry was low and similar between both treatment groups. The number of patients with increased 
serum creatinine was higher in the Riximyo group. No relevant differences in any vital signs were 
observed between Riximyo and MabThera groups in study GP13-201. ECG was only performed at 
screening, therefore, no analysis is available. 
GP13-301 
During the Combination the incidence of ECG abnormalities was higher in the Riximyo group (18 
patients vs 10 patients in the MabThera group). Abnormalities in clinical chemistry were similar for 
both treatment groups, including abnormal values of CTCAE grade 3 or 4. No relevant differences in 
any vital signs were observed between Riximyo and MabThera groups. 
In the monotherapy maintenance phase, the rate of haematological abnormalities, that worsened or 
newly emerged from the start of the maintenance phase (i.e. after finishing the combination with CVP 
phase), was similar for both treatments

GP13-201:  data from GP13-201 Part 1 Week 52 and GP13-201 Part II Week 24 data combined. 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors was not evaluated. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in terms of antibody formation and clinical symptoms (AEs). 
GP13-201 
In study GP13-201, blood samples for ADA assessments were collected before the first infusion and at 
Weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52. If patients received a second treatment course, blood samples were again 
collected before the first infusion and at the follow-up visit 26 weeks after the first infusion of the 
second treatment course. 
Across treatment arms, binding anti-rituximab antibodies were detected in 2 patients (1.2%) at 
randomization (pre-treatment). These 2 patients were excluded from further ADA analysis. 
The overall incidence of binding anti-rituximab antibodies in the Riximyo group was numerically lower 
than that of the MabThera group. Overall, post-baseline ADA was detected in 9 patients (11%) in the 
Riximyo and 18 patients (21.4%) in the MabThera group. There were no relevant differences observed 
in terms of general safety between patients with- and without ADAs. Similarly, there was no 
meaningful difference in efficacy outcome of the patients with- and without binding anti-rituximab 
antibodies. 
Samples with confirmed positive binding anti-rituximab antibodies were further assessed for the 
neutralizing capacity of the antibodies via a cell based assay (NAb assay). NAbs were detected in 3 
patients in the Riximyo group (3.7%) compared to one patient in the MabThera group (1.2%). Among 
them, two patients (1 in each arm) showed elevated ADA titer (> 100 ug/mL). 
No clinically relevant differences could be observed for potentially hyper-acute or acute infusion 
reactions or for potentially delayed reactions between both treatment groups. 
There was no relevant difference in terms of efficacy between patients with- and without NAbs, as 
shown by the DAS28 (CRP) profiles.

GP13-301 
In study GP13-301, blood samples for ADA assessments were collected at screening and at End of 
Treatment of Combination and Maintenance Phase, respectively. For patients who participated in a 
sparse pharmacokinetic sampling program, an additional sample was collected in Cycle 4 (pre-dose). 
A total of 551 (87.6%) patients were included in the immunogenicity analysis, 268 (85.4%) patients in 
the Riximyo group and 283 (89.8%) patients in the MabThera group. Five patients with pre-existing 
anti-rituximab antibodies at screening visit were excluded from the immunogenicity assessment, 4 
patients in the Riximyo group and 1 patient in the MabThera group. Of these 4 patients in the Riximyo 
group, 3 patients were tested negative post-treatment, one patient was tested positive. 
Overall, the number of patients with detectable post-dose anti-rituximab antibodies was low in the 
study (8 out of 551 patients (1.5%)), with no clinically meaningful differences between the Riximyo 
group (5 out of 268 patients, 1.9%) and the MabThera group (3 out of 283 patients, 1.1%). Based on 
the limited PK data in ADA positive patients, there is no clear indication that ADA is having an impact 
on PK exposure. 
At the EOT in the Combination Phase, there were one Riximyo patient (0.4%) and two MabThera 
patients (0.7%) who had confirmed positive results for binding-anti-rituximab antibodies.  
At the EOT in the Maintenance Phase, there was only 1 patient (Riximyo) who was positive for binding 
ADA. 
No clinically relevant differences could be observed for potentially hyper-acute or acute infusion 
reactions or for potentially delayed reactions between both treatment groups. 
An assessment of safety parameters found that the four Riximyo patients who were tested ADA 
positive during the Combination Phase had no AEs of infusion-related reactions. 
Delayed hypersensitivity reactions have not been analyzed as AE of special interest in study GP13-301. 
Therefore, only prominent potential AEs suspected to be related to study drug – like arthralgia, 
myalgia, urticaria, skin rash, and pruritus which may form part of delayed hypersensitivity reactions –
can be compared without consideration of the time distance between the infusion and the occurrence 
of the AEs. 
Neutralizing antidrug-antibodies were detected in two out of 268 (0.7%) patients in the Riximyo group 
and two out of 283 (0.7%) patients in the MabThera group. 
NAb was detected in one of the patients in the Riximyo group at the end of Maintenance Phase.  
All other NAb positive incidences were detected during the combination phase. These Nab incidences 
showed no obvious link with any immunogenicity-related SAEs or diminished efficacy. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the clinical development of Riximyo drug interactions have not been systematically investigated. 
Riximyo was developed as a biosimilar medicinal drug product; therefore, the identified and potential 
interactions of the reference product with other medicinal products MabThera as described in Section 
4.5 of the MabThera SmPC also apply to Riximyo.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
GP13-201 
The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to an AE was low for both 
treatment groups (Riximyo: 4.7%, MabThera: 8.0%). 
GP13-301 
Combination Phase 
During the Combination Phase of study GP13-301, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug was similar for AEs of all grades between both treatment groups (Riximyo: 23 patients, 
7.4%; MabThera: 22 patients, 7.0%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs leading to discontinuation 
study drug was comparable between both treatment groups (Riximyo: 14 patients [4.5%], MabThera: 
12 patients [3.8%]). 
Maintenance Phase 
During the Combination Phase of study GP13-301, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug was similar for AEs of all grades between both treatment groups (Riximyo: 23 patients, 
7.4%; MabThera: 22 patients, 7.0%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs leading to discontinuation 
study drug was comparable between both treatment groups (Riximyo: 14 patients [4.5%], MabThera:

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of Riximyo was evaluated in three clinical studies conducted in adult patients with RA (study 
GP13-201), FL (study GP13-301) where MabThera was used as comparator, and other B-cell NHLs 
(study GP13-101). The safety sample size is considered sufficient for a biosimilar application.  
Study GP13-201 
Although the Phase II study GP13-201 in RA patients was not powered to confirm safety, the outcomes 
of this study are considered relevant especially as there is no other concurrent therapy.  
The overall incidence of AEs was comparable between the treatment arms: (Riximyo: 56 patients, 
65.1% vs. MabThera: 57 patients, 65.5%). The most commonly affected primary SOC were infections 
and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. The 
most common AEs included urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, (worsening of) rheumatoid 
arthritis, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis. The overall incidence of AEs 
suspected to be related to study drug was similar for Riximyo  (32.6%) and MabThera (33.3%) with 
urinary tract infection occurring more often in the Riximyo arm (5.8% [mostly mild, 1 moderate ] vs. 
2.3%) and IRR, pruritus (each 1.2% vs. 4.6%) and rash (0 vs. 4.6%) occurring more often in the 
MabThera arm. 
The rate of discontinuation and dose adjustments/interruptions due to AEs was lower in the Riximyo 
arm compared to the MabThera arm: 4.7% vs 8.0% and 7.0% vs. 12.6%, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 97/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No apparent differences in the frequency of SAEs were observed between the treatment groups: 
Riximyo (14 patients, 6.1%), MabThera (10 patients, 4.3%). 1 death occurred in the Riximyo arm 
which was attributed to an MTX overdose. 
The incidence of AESI was similar between the treatment groups (Riximyo: 21 patients [24.4%]; 
MabThera: 22 patients [25.3%]). The most commonly reported AESI were rheumatoid arthritis (5.2% 
overall), hypertension (4.6% overall) and nausea (4.0% overall). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRR) were more commonly observed in the MabThera treatment arm 
(Riximyo: 37.2%; MabThera: 42.5%). There were no notable differences in clinical laboratory 
parameters. 
Study GP13-301 
In study GP13-301 as expected, the incidence of AEs including SAE (about 20%) during the pivotal 
combination phase was higher than in the RA study, probably due to the more frequent rituximab 
dosing regimen and the background therapy of CVP (cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisolone). E.g. 
the higher incidence of nausea and neurological disorders is likely attributable to CVP. The overall 
incidence of infections was similar in Riximyo (42.3%) and MabThera (41.9%) treatment groups.  
The incidence of AEs was similar in both treatment groups (Riximyo-CVP: 92.6%; MabThera-CVP 
91.4%). The most commonly affected primary SOCs were gastrointestinal disorders (primarily 
constipation and nausea), nervous system disorders (primarily peripheral neuropathy, and 
paraesthesia), infections and infestations (primarily urinary tract infection and upper respiratory tract 
infection).  
In the combination phase, neutropenia was far more commonly reported (Riximyo: 25.6%, MabThera: 
29.5%), than in the RA study (1.2% for MabThera, no case for Riximyo). The rate of febrile 
neutropenias was also higher in the Riximyo group (4.8% vs 2.9%). This is likely due to concurrent 
cyclophosphamide treatment, but also the more intensive treatment of rituximab may further 
contribute to neutropenia. E.g. in the original registration trial for the FL indication, neutropenia 
occurred in 24% in the CVP+ rituximab arm, versus 13% in the CVP+ placebo arm. Notably, the 
incidence of neutropenia in this study is similar to the historical data.  
At least 5% absolute differences in AEs were observed for peripheral neuropathy and paresthesia. 
However, differentiation of these terms may be difficult and when adding incidences for both terms 
these differences between the treatment groups disappear. 
The incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs was comparable between the treatment arms 
(Riximyo: 23 patients, [7.4%]; MabThera: 22 patients, [7.0%]). The incidence of AEs requiring dose 
interruption and/or reduction was lower in the Riximyo arm. 
Adverse events of special interest included CRS and PML. None of these were observed during the 
Combination Phase. The incidences of IRR considered to be related to study drug were comparable for 
Riximyo and MabThera during Combination Phase (13.1% and 11.7%, respectively). 
Some adverse events which were observed more frequently in the Riximyo arm (urinary tract 
infections, increased serum creatinine in GP13-201; cardiac disorders, ECG abnormalities in the 
Combination Phase of study GP13-301) and especially during the Maintenance Phase of GP13-301 
(higher incidences of AEs, Grade 4 AEs, SAEs, related AEs, discontinuation due to AEs, Neutropenia 
and infections and infestations SOC) were further analysed and the findings from the updates balanced 
out previous findings. The concern for neutropenia was resolved since it did not reflect in an increase

Page 98/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of infections and its evaluation of a carry-over effect of the earlier treatment combination phase with 
chemotherapy (CVP regimen).  
Study GP13-301 - Maintenance Phase 
The incidence of AEs was higher in Riximyo group (63.2%) compared to the MabThera group (57.1%) 
with injury, poisoning and procedural complications (Riximyo: 6.5%; MabThera: 3.0%) and vascular 
disorders (Riximyo: 5.6%; MabThera: 3.5%) being the SOCs with the largest absolute difference of 
3.5% and 2.1%, respectively, and neutropenia and cough being the more frequently observed AEs by 
preferred term in the Riximyo group. More Grade 4 AEs were observed for the Riximyo treatment 
group compared to MabThera (12 patients [5.2%] vs. 4 patients [1.7%]) again with neutropenia being 
the most frequently observed AE. Treatment-related neutropenia occurred with a frequency > 5 % 
(Riximyo, all grades 6.9%, grade 3/4 4.3%; MabThera, all grades 5.2%, grade 3/4 3.5%). 
Overall, the percentage difference for AEs during the maintenance phase for the Riximyo arm 
compared to the MabThera arm decreased from 6.1% to 1.6% with data cut-off from 10-Jul-2016. 
The mechanism causing neutropenia following rituximab treatment is not well understood, as CD20 is 
not expressed on neutrophil granulocytes. The mechanism of rituximab induced neutropenia has still 
not been elucidated, while many hypotheses have been presented. Several authors suggest a 
disturbance of haematopoiesis after rituximab treatment (Expert Rev Hematol. 2011;4(6):619-625). 
As described in the SmPC of MabThera, neutropenia was not associated with a higher rate of infections 
in earlier studies.  
When CVP was withdrawn in the maintenance phase, the rate of neutropenia dropped considerably, 
towards 10% (7.4 % grade 3/4) in the Riximyo arm, and 5.6% (3.9% Grade 3/4) in the MabThera 
arm. The modest discrepancy between treatment arms is difficult to interpret. Reassuringly, this was 
not associated with an enhanced rate of infections for Riximyo in the maintenance phase (cut –off 10-
Jul-2016: SOC infections and infestations - Riximyo: 32.7%; MabThera: 36.5%)).  
The incidences of AEs leading to dose adjustment or interruption and AEs requiring additional therapy 
were similar between the treatment groups. As for the slightly higher number of  patients discontinuing 
treatment due to an AEin the Riximyo arm, this percentage difference decreased  with the data update 
(10 [3.9%] in Riximyo and 7 [2.8%] in MabThera). There was a higher incidence of disease 
progression in the Riximyo arm (N=37 [16.0%]) compared to the MabThera arm (N=25 [10.8%]). 
However, the overall treatment discontinuation between the Riximyo arm and the MabThera arm is 
reducing with the maturation of data. 
Adverse events of special interest included CRS and PML. None of these were observed during the 
Maintenance Phase. The incidences of IRR considered to be related to study drug were comparable for 
Riximyo and MabThera during Maintenance Phase (10.8% and 8.2%, respectively).  
Combination and Maintenance Phase – Deaths, Laboratory, Immunogenicity 
The number of deaths occurring in the Combination, Maintenance and Post-treatment was comparable 
between the treatment groups (Riximyo: 18 [5.8%]; MabThera: 17 [5.4%]). 
There were no notable differences in laboratory findings. 
The number of ADA-positive patients was low for both treatment arms (Riximyo: 5 (1.9%) patients; 
MabThera: 3 (1.1%) patients). NAbs were only detected in 4 patients (2 in each treatment arm). 
Clinical data did not reveal a negative impact of ADA-positivity on the efficacy and safety of Riximyo. 
Immunogenicity studies GP13-201 and GP13-301 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 99/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the RA study, the rate of ADA formation was higher for MabThera than for Riximyo (21.4% versus 
11.0%). In many cases, the ADAs were transient. The number of neutralising ADA was small without 
meaningful differences between groups (3.7% vs 1.2% for Riximyo and MabThera, respectively). There 
was no clear relationship between ADAs and safety/efficacy. Moreover, based on quality assays, no 
differences in immunogenicity are to be anticipated.  
CVP including high dosages of prednisolone may suppress ADA formation more than methotrexate, 
which was the background therapy in the RA study. Moreover, the dosages of rituximab were 
considerable higher in the FL study in comparison to the RA study, which may further suppress 
antibody formation. This may explain the low incidence of ADA of 1.5% in the combination phase. Also 
in the maintenance phase the incidence of ADA remained low. However, as the data are yet incomplete 
of this ongoing study, an update of ADA data is requested, also considering that the number of 
subjects from the RA study was limited, and carry-over effect of CVP is expected to decrease in due 
time (see RMP). 
There were no relevant differences observed in terms of general safety between patients with and 
without NAbs. No SAEs were reported for the NAb positive patients in the Riximyo arm, whereas two 
suspected drug-related SAEs of moderate intensities (gastroenteritis and infusion reaction) were 
reported for the patient in the MabThera arm. The study drug was permanently discontinued due to the 
event. No relevant differences were observed in the DAS28 (CRP) profiles of ADA positive patients as 
compared to the ADA negative patients. The DAS profiles of ADA positive and ADA negative patients 
were equally distributed; no trending was observed which would suggest that ADA positivity leads to 
either better or worse DAS28 response.  
Immunogenicity results from study GP13-201 may indicate slight differences with respect to the ADA 
incidence being 2-fold lower in RA patients treated with Riximyo compared to MabThera (11.0 % vs. 
21.4 %), however, the data in the RA study were limited and at any rate, it is likely that the difference 
of -10% could be a chance finding and ultimately it is not of concern since immunogenicity –if 
anything—is lower than that of RMP which is in accordance with the overarching guidelines 
(CHMP/437/04 Rev 1;  EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). In study GP13-301 there was no signal 
of differences in immunogenicity and ADA formation between Riximyo (2.1%) and MabThera (0.9%). 
The ADA formation may be suppressed by concurrent use of CVP in the main treatment phase of the 
pivotal trial.  
From the safety database of rituximab all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-
marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics which follows the one of 
Mabthera. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Riximyo appears to be comparable to the reference product MabThera with 
most common reported events being infections, infusion related reactions, and in the NHL study, 
neutropenia. In general, the frequencies and nature of the adverse events were similar between 
Riximyo and MabThera, and in line with earlier reports for the Reference product MabThera in the RA 
and FL study populations. Final reports from the ongoing studies will provide further information on 
clinical safety (see RMP).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. No full user 
consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
bridging report making reference to MabThera. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has 
been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Riximyo (rituximab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The therapeutic context of rituximab is very well described over the years since it first received the MA 
in the EU (2nd June 1998), as Mabthera. 
Riximyo (rituximab) has been developed as a biosimilar of MabThera, the reference product. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approval is sought for all approved indications of the reference product MabThera in the EU, 
according to the MabThera Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL)); Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The originator MabThera is available in the EU since 1998; therefore there is no unmet medical need. 
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 107/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A pivotal PK/PD study was performed in 173 patients with RA who were irresponsive or intolerant to 
one or more TNF-alpha inhibitors, comparing a standard treatment course of either Riximyo to 
MabThera of 1,000 mg per iv infusion, two weeks apart. After 24 weeks, patients could be re-treated 
based on the presence of residual disease activity (DAS28>2.6), in line with the approved posology of 
MabThera. The study was powered to assess equivalence of PK in terms of the area under the serum 
concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) and PD in terms of B-cell depletion 
between Riximyo and MabThera (GP13- 201 Study Part I). The study also provides data on key efficacy 
and safety including immunogenicity variables. 
A pivotal efficacy and safety study in 627 patients with previously untreated advanced FL (study GP13-
301). In total 627 subjects received at least one study treatment. Patients were randomised to either 
Riximyo or MabThera 375 mg/m2 IV for 8 cycles (every 3 weeks), in combination with CVP 
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone). The study was powered to demonstrate equivalence of 
clinical response (ORR at week 24) as the primary endpoint between Riximyo and MabThera 
(equivalence margin -/+ 12%) and to provide data on PK/PD and safety including immunogenicity 
assessments. Primary analyses were performed in the Per-Protocol Set (n=624). PK-PD data were 
obtained from a small subset of 48 subjects. The study consisted of a Combination Treatment Phase 
followed by a Maintenance Treatment Phase in which responding patients continued earlier assigned 
treatment with Riximyo or MabThera as monotherapy (375 mg/m2 every 2-3 months) for another 24 
months (n=462). This part of the study is still ongoing at the time of data cut-off of for this MAA.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Since the favourable effects of rituximab (as Mabthera) are well established, this application aims to 
prove similarity between Riximyo (GP2013) and the originator MabThera. This is confirmed on non-
clinical grounds with regard to: antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) in different assay set-
ups; B-cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys after repeated dosing of 20 or 100 mg/kg 4qw; survival 
in xenografted mouse models; tumour growth in xenografted mouse models. 
The required bioequivalence criterion of 90% CI of 80 - 125% between Riximyo and MabThera for the 
primary parameter AUC0-inf was fulfilled and this was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis including 
body surface area as an additional covariate in the pivotal study GP13-201 performed in RA patients. 
In Study GP13-201, the ratio of the geometric means of AUEC(0-14d) between Riximyo and MabThera 
was 1.019 (95% CI 0.997, 1.042), which is well within the pre-set bioequivalence margin of 0.80-1.25. 
This is further supported by exploratory analyses in the two NHL studies, showing a rapid induction 
and persistent low level of B-cells during treatment of GP-2012, similar to MabThera. 
In study GP13-201 the key secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at 
Week 24. The criterion for non-inferiority was met. Results from the ACR20 response analysis at week 
24 and averaged ACR20 responders between week 4 and week 24 showed that Riximyo and MabThera 
are similar regarding ACR20 rates with when applying equivalence margins of ±15%.  
In the pivotal efficacy and safety study GP13-301 equivalence with regards to ORR (primary efficacy 
endpoint) was demonstrated as the entire 95% CI for the difference in ORR between the two 
treatments was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±12%. BOR was assessed as secondary 
efficacy endpoint. The proportions of patients in Combination Treatment Phase with the best overall 
response (BOR) based on central blinded review of tumour assessments (CR, PR, stable disease and 
progressive disease) and their associated 90% CIs were similar for the four tumour assessment 
categories.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties regarding the biosimilarity of Riximyo to MabTthera in terms of the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.  
In study GP13-301 at (data cut-off: 31-Dec-2016) more patients in the MabThera arm are on ongoing 
treatment whereas a higher number of patients treated with Riximyo than MabThera ended treatment 
in the maintenance phase with the primary reason for discontinuation being disease progression 
(20.9% versus 14.3%).  The HR for PFS (Riximyo/MabThera) was 1.31 (90% CI [1.02, 1.69]), at the 
December cut-off, in the same range as observed with the first PFS analysis (data cut off: 10-Jul-
2016) where the PFS HR was calculated to be 1.25 (90% CI: [0.96, 1.61]). However, as study GP13-
301 was not powered for time-to-event outcomes, hence, for PFS and OS the currently observed data 
are still immature. Moreover, the follow-up time up to now is too short to allow for an estimation of 
median PFS and the number of PFS events low and the rate of censoring high. The availability of the 
study report will provide further information on PFS (see RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Riximyo in study GP13-201 was comparable to MabThera with regards to the 
incidence of overall adverse events, SAEs and AESI. The following incidences were even lower in the 
Riximyo arm: premature discontinuation and dose adjustments/interruptions due to AEs, Infusion-
related reactions and overall ADA.  
Infections and infusion-related reactions were the most commonly reported events (RA Study GP13-
201: Riximyo: 31.4 and 37.2%, respectively; MabThera: 35.6% and 42.5%, respectively).  
In study GP13-301 during the Combination Phase the safety profile of Riximyo was comparable to 
MabThera with regards to the incidence of overall adverse events, Grade 3-4 adverse events, 
suspected treatment related adverse events, treatment discontinuation due to AEs, dose adjustment or 
interruption and AEs requiring additional therapy as well as deaths. 
The incidences of IRR considered to be related to study drug were comparable for Riximyo and 
MabThera during Combination Phase. 
Overall, in the Maintenance Phase, the following incidences were higher in the Riximyo group: Overall 
Adverse events, Grade 4 AEs, suspected treatment-related AEs, treatment discontinuation due to AEs, 
serious adverse events, Neutropenia all Grades, Infections and infestation most frequent SOC in 
serious adverse events and reason for treatment discontinuation. With the data update from the cut-
off from 10 July 2016 the percentage difference for AEs during the maintenance phase for the Riximyo 
arm compared to the MabThera arm decreased from 6.1% to 1.6%. The percentage number of SAEs 
and discontinuation due to AEs was comparable between the treatment arms. Although, the number of 
AEs suspected to be related to study drug is slightly higher for the Riximyo arm, the number of Grade 
3-4 AEs as well as the number of SAEs are comparable between the treatment arms.  
There  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  ADA  formation  between  Riximyo  and  MabThera.  In  the  RA 
study,  ADAs  were  detected  in  11.0%  versus  21.4%  in  the  Riximyo  and  MabThera  arm,  respectively. 
Neutralising ADAs were detected in 3.7% of the  Riximyo  arm and 1.2% of  the MabThera arm. There 
was  no  clear  relationship  between  the  presence  of  ADA’s  and  efficacy/safety.  Overall,  the  number  of 
patients with ADA was low in Study GP13-301 in Follicular Lymphoma (8 /551 subjects, 1.5%), without 
meaningful differences between treatment assignments. The rate of ADA formation may be reduced by 
concurrent chemotherapy or prednisolone.

In order to further investigate the risks of Immunogenicity, infusion related reactions, infections 
(including serious infections), neutropenia, the applicant will conduct and submit the results of:  
- GP13-201 (Study Part 2), a randomised, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy of Riximyo and rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
refractory or intolerant to standard DMARDs and one or up to three anti-TNF therapies. 
- GP13-301, a randomised, controlled, double-blind Phase III trial to compare the efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetics of Riximyo plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone vs. MabThera plus 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, followed by Riximyo or MabThera maintenance therapy in 
patients with previously untreated, advanced stage follicular lymphomain patients with previously 
untreated, advanced stage follicular lymphoma. 
- GP13-302: A randomized, double- blind, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to assess the 
safety and immunogenicity of transitioning to Riximyo or re-treatment with Rituxan / Riximyo or 
MabThera in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, previously treated with Rituxan / Riximyo or 
MabThera.

(BSRBR), Swedish registry (ARTIS) and German registry (RABBIT). 
Please see RMP section 2.7. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties concerning the comparability of the clinical safety of Riximyo with Mabthera. 
Further long term safety information will be provided with the final study report (see RMP). 
3.6.  Effects Table 
Not applicable for biosimilars. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A comprehensive biosimilarity exercise, which covered all relevant structural and functional 
characteristics of the rituximab molecule, was submitted. The presented results support the 
biosimilarity claim; similarity between Riximyo and the EU reference product MabThera is considered 
demonstrated at the quality level. Any minor differences observed have been adequately justified with 
respect to the efficacy/safety profile of Riximyo. 
Comparability data on three relevant mechanisms of action (CDC, ADCC, ADCP and apoptosis), which 
are considered important for lysis of the B-cell subsequent to binding of rituximab to the CD20 antigen 
were provided. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for the primary PK endpoint AUC(0-inf) as well as 
mostly all other secondary PK endpoints. The descriptive data for the PK parameters determined in 
study GP13-201 indicate comparability between Riximyo and MabThera.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint in study GP13-201 was met and results of the analyses for the 
ACR20 rates of response at week 24 and averaged ACR20 responders between week 4 and week 24 
were within the applied equivalence margins of ±15% thereby suggesting similarity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/440905/2017  
Page 110/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint (ORR) in GP13-301 was met.  Updated OS and PFS data will be 
submitted with the final study report (see RMP). 
The adverse events with Riximyo were in overall in line with the well-established safety profile of 
Mabthera. Overall, the rates of ADA formation were low in both the RA trial and the study in FL. 
Updates on safety will be submitted with the final CSRs of the ongoing studies (see RMP). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Biosimilarity of Riximyo to the originator Mabthera has been demonstrated with regards to PK/PD, 
efficacy and safety parameters in two clinical trials and two different indications Rheumatoid Arthritis 
and Follicular Lymphoma. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
With regards to the efficacy, it is well established that the mechanism of action and PD aspects are 
common across autoimmune and across oncology indications of Mabthera.  Therefore, and in line with 
the EMA guidelines on the similar biological medicinal products, the efficacy results obtained with 
Riximyo, demonstrating equivalence with Mabthera in RA and FL patients can be reasonably 
extrapolated to the other approved therapeutic indications of Mabthera. 
The applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for adult patients for the biosimilar Riximyo as 
granted for Mabthera for iv administration in the EU. However, as Mabthera is also marketed in the 
subcutaneous indication, a risk of medication error has been identified. Adequate risk minimisation 
measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in the RMP.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
Riximyo is considered biosimilar to Mabthera and therefore the overall Benefit Risk balance of Riximyo 
is considered positive in the following indications: 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
Riximyo is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.  
Riximyo maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding 
to induction therapy. 
Riximyo monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who 
are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
Riximyo is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) 
chemotherapy. 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Riximyo in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor 
therapies. 
Riximyo has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.

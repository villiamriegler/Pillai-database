fibrillation (NVAF) patients who may require cardioversion.  
For patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, at 
least 5 doses of apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice 
daily in patients who qualify for a dose reduction (see 
recommendation for Dose reduction and Renal 
impairment)) should be given before cardioversion to 
ensure adequate anticoagulation.  
If cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can 
be administered, a 10 mg loading dose should be given, 
followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be 
reduced to a 5 mg loading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice 
daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction 
(see recommendation for Dose reduction and Renal 
impairment). The administration of the loading dose should 
be given at least 2 hours before cardioversion. 
Confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that 
the patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on

Clinical efficacy and safety information for patients 
undergoing cardioversion: 
EMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 
patients who were either oral anticoagulant naïve or pre-
treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion 
for NVAF. Patients were randomized 1:1 to apixaban or to 
heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of cardiovascular 
events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was 
conducted after at least 5 doses of 5 mg twice daily 
apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients or at 
least 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading 
dose in selected patients if earlier cardioversion was 
required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a 
loading dose (331 patients received the 10 mg dose and 11 
patients received the 5 mg dose). 
There were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n= 
753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin and/or VKA 
group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All cause 
death occurred in 2 patients (0.27%) in the apixaban group 
and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No 
systemic embolism events were reported. 
Major bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 
(0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, respectively, in the 
apixaban group,  compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) 
patients in the heparin and/or VKA group. 
This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and 
safety between apixaban and heparin and/or VKA

n/a 
The drug utilisation study (DUS) (B0661073) is a 
(B0661073) listed as a category 4 study in the RMP. 
This is a non-interventional post-authorisation safety 
study (PASS) of the utilisation patterns of apixaban 
in Denmark. In addition, a revised RMP (version 
18.0) is submitted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional study that uses 
electronic healthcare data from the Danish national 
registries to describe the utilisation patterns of apixaban in 
Denmark. The study was conducted to estimate the 
proportion of apaxiban users in the outpatient settings who 
received the drug for the approved indications at the time 
of the study, and to describe the characteristics of patients 
who were prescribed apixaban for on-label or off-label 
indications. The results of this study indicated that 
apixaban was mostly (82.6%) used for on-label indications, 
with the majority of patients using apixaban for non-
valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The proportion of on-label 
apixaban use reported was similar to that of a previous

Swedish DUS study (86.4% on-label), and to the proportion 
on-label use reported in the literature for other non-vitamin 
K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (80-90% on-label use). Off-
label use was found in nearly 11% of patients. The 
proportion of off-label use reported was comparable to that 
reported in previous similar DUS study in Sweden (7.7% 
off-label use). These results did not warrant an update of 
the product information.

risk minimisation tools appears to have positive impact 
upon knowledge, comprehension, and behaviour among 
health care professionals and patients/caregivers regarding 
Eliquis treatment and associated bleeding risk. Although 
distribution and utilisation were not optimal, they are 
consistent with findings from similar effectiveness 
evaluation studies of risk minimisation tools. At present, 
the MAH does not propose any modifications to the content 
of the risk minimisation tools. The results are consistent 
with study objectives and support the effectiveness of the 
risk minisation tools for their intended purpose.

Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in water, or 
5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice or mixed with 
apple puree and immediately administered orally. 
Alternatively, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and 
suspended in 60 mL of water or D5W and immediately 
delivered through a nasogastric tube.  
Crushed Eliquis tablets are stable in water, D5W, apple 
juice, and apple puree for up to 4 hours. 
Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 
crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of water, 
exposure was comparable to exposure after oral 
administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. Following oral 
administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg 
tablets with 30 g of apple puree, the Cmax and AUC were 
20% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to 
administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in 
exposure is not considered clinically relevant. 
Following administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet

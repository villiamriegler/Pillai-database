2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the disease  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In 2012, the annual incidence of lung 
cancer worldwide was 23.1 per 100,000 persons, and the incidence was higher in men (34.2 per 100,000) 
than  women  (13.6  per  100,000)  according  to  estimates  from  the  World  Health  Organization  and 
International  Agency  for  Research  on  Cancer  (IARC)  GLOBOCAN  project.  In  Europe,  lung  cancer  had  an 
incidence  of  46.6  per  100,000  men  and  15.1  per  100,000  women  (Ferlay  et  al,  2013).  In  the  US,  the

incidence of lung or bronchial cancer was 76.4 per 100,000 men and 52.7 per 100,000 women (Howlander 
et al, 2012). Most lung cancers (85%) are NSCLC (Tyczynski et al, 2003) that present as inoperable locally 
advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) disease with no curative treatment available. United States 
(US)  Surveillance,  Epidemiology,  and  End  Results  (SEER)  data  indicated  that  the  5-year  survival  rate 
between  2002  and  2008  among  all  patients  with  NSCLC  was  17.5%  (Howlander  et  al,  2012).  However, 
5-year survival rates have been shown to be 5% and <1% for Stage IIIB and Stage IV NSLCL, respectively 
(Reck, 2012). 
Until  recently,  platinum-based  chemotherapy  has  been  standard  first-line  treatment  and  docetaxel, 
pemetrexed,  and  erlotinib  were  the  approved  agents  after  at  least  1  prior  chemotherapy  regimen  for 
patients with advanced NSCLC of any histological subtype. These standard therapies have modest impact on 
efficacy  outcomes  in  unselected  NSCLC  with  objective  response  rates  (ORRs)  of  9  to  35%,  median 
progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 3 to 6 months across first- and second-line treatment, and 
median overall survival (OS) of 8 to 12 months in the front line setting (Sandler et al, 2006; Scagliotti et al, 
2008; Schiller et al, 2002; Herbst et al, 2004; Herbst et al, 2005; Kelly et al, 2001). 
An emerging paradigm in oncology suggests that robust clinical efficacy can be obtained with well-tolerated 
inhibitors  directed  toward  oncogenic  tyrosine  kinases  that  are  genetically  altered  through  activating 
mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification. 
As the molecular basis of NSCLC became better understood, agents that target specific molecular signalling 
pathways  have  become  the  standard  of  care  particularly  in  subsets  of  patients  whose  tumours  contain 
dominant  genetic  driver  alterations.  Similar  to  the  paradigm  established  for  the  treatment  of  epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC with erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib (Lynch et al, 2004; Pao 
et  al,  2004;  Wu  et  al,  2014),  and  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC  (hereafter  referred  to  as  ALK-positive 
NSCLC) with crizotinib and ceritinib (Shaw et al, 2013; Solomon et al, 2014; Shaw, Kim, Mehra et al, 2014), 
NSCLC  defined  by  ROS1-positive  advanced  NSCLC  (hereafter  referred  to  as  ROS1-positive  NSCLC) 
represents an additional subgroup of lung cancer patients who might benefit from specific targeted therapy. 
ROS1  oncogene  encodes  an  orphan  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (RTK)  related  to  ALK,  leukocyte  RTK,  and 
members of the insulin receptor family (Acquaviva et al, 2009). 
ROS1-positive  NSCLC  occurs  in  approximately  1-2%  of  patients  with  NSCLC  (Gainor and Shaw,  2013; 
Bergethon et al, 2012). Similar to patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC 
tend to be younger and never smokers with a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma compared to other 
unselected patients with lung cancer (Gainor and Shaw, 2013; Bergethon et al, 2012).  ALK and ROS1 gene 
rearrangements rarely occur in the same tumour, with each defining a unique molecular subgroup of NSCLC 
(Gainor and Shaw, 2013). 
Information  regarding  the  natural  history  of  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  is  currently  limited,  but  several 
retrospective  analyses  describing  the  natural  history  of  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  have  been  published 
(Bergethon et al, 2012; Yoshida et al, 2013; Cai et al, 2013; Chen et al, 2014; Lee et al, 2013; Fu et al, 
2015; Scheffler et al, 2015). 
Cumulatively, these findings suggest that ROS1 positivity is unlikely to be a favourable prognostic factor in 
NSCLC, similar to what has previously been shown in ALK-positive NSCLC (Shaw et al, 2009; Shaw et al, 
2011). 
ROS1 Diagnostic Testing  
Several different testing platforms (i.e., methodologies) are able to directly identify gene rearrangements, 
including  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH),  reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(RT-PCR) techniques, and next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Approaches to diagnostic testing in NSCLC continue to evolve given advances in technology. NGS technology 
in  particular  enables  multiplexed testing  of  multiple target gene  analytes  in  a  single  test  rather  than  by 
sequential testing, providing critical efficiencies in both time to test result and in the use of limiting tissue. 
The  continuing  identification  of  additional,  typically  uncommon,  molecularly-defined  subpopulations  of 
patients that may benefit from targeted therapies (ie, patients with genetic alterations in genes encoding 
ROS1, BRAF, c-Met, and others) highlights the importance of multiplexed approaches to diagnostic testing in 
NSCLC.  
About the product 
Xalkori (crizotinib) is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and its 
oncogenic variants (i.e., ALK fusion events and selected ALK mutations). Crizotinib is also an inhibitor of the 
hepatocyte  growth  factor  receptor  (HGFR,  c-Met),  c-ros  oncogene  1  (ROS1),  and  Recepteur  d’Origine 
Nantais (RON) RTKs. Xalkori received a conditional approval in the EU on 23 October 2012, for the treatment 
of adults with previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The indication was later extended to first 
line treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC on 23 November 2015. 
The aim of this type II variation is to extend Xalkori indication to treatment of adults with ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC. This application is mainly supported by data for patients with ROS1 positive NSCLC from 
Study A8081001 (pivotal study) and a review of relevant publications on the efficacy and safety of crizotinib 
in  patients  with  ROS1  positive  NSCLC  (supportive  information).  Study  A8081001  (a  multinational, 
multicenter,  open-label,  single-arm  study  of  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  and 
antitumor activity of crizotinib in patients with advanced cancer), included a dose-escalation phase, and an 
expansion phase during which several cohorts of patients received the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). 
The  RP2D  cohorts  included  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  and  other  advanced  cancers,  including 
tumours harbouring a ROS1 gene rearrangement as per Amendment 12 of the protocol. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Crizotinib demonstrated in vitro inhibition of tyrosine kinase in biochemical enzymatic assays and in 
cell-based assays against echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK, nucleophosmin 
(NPM)-ALK, c-Met/HGFR and RON enzyme in several human cell lines. Crizotinib major metabolites were 
also tested and crizotinib lactam metabolites showed relevant inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range, 
thus close to crizotinib potency. When tested to its selectivity for different kinases, crizotinib was relatively 
specific to c-Met/HGFR and ALK fusion proteins. 
Crizotinib inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and motility in tumour or endothelial cells 
expressing EML4-ALK, NPM-ALK or c-Met/HGFR. These data suggest that crizotinib has an effect on both 
tumour cell growth and survival, and on angiogenesis. 
In vivo, Crizotinib demonstrated a dose-dependent cytoreductive antitumour activity in several tumour 
models expressing EML4-ALK, NPM-ALK or c-Met/HGFR. PK/PD modelling indicated that the extent and 
duration of the inhibition of target kinase phosphorylation is directly related to the level of anti-tumour 
efficacy. Near complete inhibition of ALK or c-Met/HGFR activity for the duration of treatment is necessary to 
get the maximal anti-tumour efficacy (tumour regression). There is a correlation between inhibition of ALK 
or c-Met/HGFR phosphorylation and modulation of key signalling pathways involved in cancer cell survival, 
growth, proliferation and apoptosis. Crizotinib also exhibited an antiangiogenic effect when administered for 
a long time. This effect was not seen in every tumour type.

2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
The strategy for the characterization of crizotinib for its inhibitory activity against ROS and ROS-dependent 
functions included the evaluation of: 1) potency for inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation 
of ROS and its oncogenic fusion variants in both biochemical enzyme assays and cellular pharmacodynamic 
assays; 2) the effects on ROS fusion-dependent signal transduction and cellular functions that are altered 
during cancer progression such as cell proliferation and viability in HCC78 human NSCLC cells harbouring 
SLC34A2-ROS fusions; and 3) ROS target inhibition and antitumor efficacy in a panel of NIH3T3 tumour 
models engineered to express human oncogenic ROS fusion variants in vivo, and 4) 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships for inhibition of tumour growth and induction of 
tumour regression. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies 
Pharmacodynamic Assays Evaluating Inhibition of ROS by Crizotinib in Biochemical and Cellular Assays In 
Vitro 
The capacity of crizotinib to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ROS and ROS fusion proteins was evaluated in 
vitro in biochemical and cell-based assays (Study Report 144804). 
Crizotinib inhibited the phosphorylation of a synthetic substrate using a recombinant ROS catalytic domain 
in  the  presence  of  ATP.  In  cellular  systems,  crizotinib  inhibited  ROS  autophosphorylation,  evaluated  by 
ELISA on cell lysates, in two cell lines bearing constitutively active ROS fusion kinases. In HCC78, a NSCLC 
expressing the SLC34A2-ROS fusion produced by a chromosomal translocations, crizotinib inhibited ROS 
autophosphorylation with an IC50 of 47 nM. Similarly IC50 was 60 nM in U138MG, a human glioblastoma cell 
line  expressing  the  Fig-ROS  fusion  protein.  The  capacity  to  inhibit  also  different  fusion  variants  was 
confirmed using transduced 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line; the IC50 observed in these cell systems were in 
the same order of magnitude observed when endogenous mutant kinases were inhibited in human cell lines 
(see table below).

In  HCC78  cells,  in  addition  to  kinase  inhibition,  crizotinib  inhibited  cell  proliferation  (EC50  46  nM)  and 
increase the cleavage of caspase 3 suggesting that the drug also induces apoptosis. In this cell system, 
crizotinib reduced, in concentration-dependent manner, the phosphorylation of other proteins downstream 
in  ROS  intracellular  pathway  such  as  SHP2,  ERK1/2,  AKT  and  STAT3  evaluated  by  immune-blotting. 
Inhibition of cell proliferation was observed also in BaF3 cells, a pro-B mouse cell line dependant on IL-3, 
made IL-3 independent by transduction with CD74-ROS (EC50 5.8 nM). 
In vivo studies 
Pharmacodynamic inhibition of ROS and antitumor efficacy of crizotinib in vivo 
In vivo evaluation was performed using 3T3 mouse fibroblast engineered to express oncogenic human ROS 
fusion proteins (described in the table above) since the human cell lines HCC78 and U138MG, used for in 
vitro experiments, do not induce tumours in nude mice. After injection in immunodeficient mice all these 
genetically modified cells produced subcutaneous tumours with a rapid growth pattern whereas the cells 
transduced with the empty retroviral vector did not. Crizotinib administered by oral route at 75 mg/kg twice 
a day for 11 to 17 days caused the regression of established tumours in all the cell models evaluated (see 
figure below).

PK/PD Relationship of Tumour Growth Inhibition to Plasma Levels of Crizotinib in the 3T3-CD74-ROS and 
3T3-SLC34A2-ROS Xenograft Models 
A PK/PD study was performed using different doses of crizotinib in immunodeficient mice bearing tumours 
induced by 3T3-SLC34A2-ROS(L) or 3T3-CD74-ROS (s);  treatment was administered twice daily for 10 or 
11  days  with  daily  doses  from  20  to  160  mg/kg.  In  both  models  crizotinib  induced  a  dose  dependent 
inhibition of tumour growth and ROS phosphorylation without affecting mouse body weight. Doses of 80 to 
160  mg/kg/day  were  associated  with  almost  complete  tumour  regression.  PK  analysis  estimated  a  free 
plasma  concentration  of  99  nM  and  84  nM  to  induce  a  total  growth  inhibition  in  tumour  bearing  the 
CD74-ROS(s) and SCL34A2-ROS(L), respectively.

2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Crizotinib  demonstrated  marked  antitumour  activity  in  mouse  xenograft  studies,  where  tumours  were 
generated using a panel of NIH-3T3 cell lines engineered to express key ROS1 fusions identified in human 
tumours. The antitumour  efficacy of crizotinib was  dose-dependent and demonstrated a correlation with 
inhibition of ROS1 phosphorylation in vivo. 
 New data on secondary pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
are not needed for this type of application. 
In line with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/ SWP/4447/00 “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use”, an updated ERA to cover the ROS1 positive NSCLC 
patients extension of indication was provided.  
The refined Fpen value (0.012%) was calculated on GLOCAN prevalence data (340/100,000) of lung cancer 
in EU-28 that appears conservative in respect the value calculated by NORDCAN database for Nordic EU 
Countries, in which the overall prevalence of lung cancer is 74/100.000.  
The study on transformation in water/sediment systems (OECD 308) and the study on transformation in soil 
(OECD 307) show that the active substance crizotinib is very persistent considering e.g. the DT50 values of 
401 and 307 d at 12°C in soils (188 and 144 d at 20°C) and the non-decreasing values in sediment. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The potential role of crizotinib in the treatment of NSCLC with hyperactivated ROS has been adequately 
demonstrated by the biochemical evidence of enzymatic inhibition of ROS and ROS variants and by in vitro 
and in vivo inhibition of tumour or transformed cells expressing constitutively active forms of the kinase. 
Relevant information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The nonclinical pharmacology data package for crizotinib supports its intended use for the treatment of 
patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC.  
This extension of the indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of crizotinib.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study  A8081001  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  1001)  is  an  ongoing  study  evaluating  the  safety,  PK, 
antitumor activity, and PD of crizotinib administered as an oral single agent to patients with advanced cancer 
(excluding leukemias).  Study 1001 included a dose escalation component followed by an expansion phase 
in which the RP2D established in the initial phase was to be evaluated in molecularly defined cohorts of 
patients,  including  patients  with  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC  (ALK-positive  NSCLC),  patients  with 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC (ROS1-positive NSCLC), and patients with ALK negative NSCLC. Crizotinib 
was to be administered orally at the standard dose of 250 mg BID in continuous 28-day cycles (or 21-day 
cycles for the 3 patients in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort). 
Methods 
Pre-dose sparse PK samples were collected in 53 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 1001.  This 
cohort consisted of 50 patients in the ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort and an additional 3 patients from the 
ALK-negative NSCLC cohort (referred to as the ALK-marker negative Cohort No. 2 in the protocol), who were 
determined retrospectively to have ROS1-positive NSCLC after enrollment. Of these 53 patients, 46 had at 
least 1 predose plasma concentration (Ctrough) of crizotinib and were included in the PKP_Ctrough population. 
The  Ctrough  was  the  pre-dose  plasma  concentration  collected  between  1.2  hours  and  0  hours  before  the 
morning dose on the PK collection day (or 10.8 hours to 13.2 hours after the evening dose on the prior day 
in the case of a missing morning dose on the PK collection day).  Steady-state trough plasma concentrations 
(Ctrough,ss) were obtained using the arithmetic mean of all evaluable Ctrough on or after Cycle1 Day15 for each 
patient in the PKP_Ctrough,ss population. 
Crizotinib  was  determined  using  a  validated  high-performance  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass 
spectrometry method.

ROS1, encoded by the ROS1 gene on chromosome 6q22, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to a 
family  of  insulin  receptors.  Recently,  ROS1  fusions  have  been  described  in  1.7%  of  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cases.  
A  validation  report  of  a  Massachusetts  General  Hospital  (MGH)  laboratory  developed  test  (LDT)  utilizing 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes targeted against the ROS1 gene was submitted. The probes 
are being validated to detect the ROS1 gene in interphase cells of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
tissue samples. 
Utilizing  a  FISH-based  detection  platform  enables  comprehensive  assessment  of  ROS1  gene 
rearrangements in NSCLC FFPE tissue sections with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. 
The specific performance characteristics of the MGH ROS1 FISH assay were determined by studies using 
FFPE tissue specimens collected from NSCLC patients. 
Determinations  of  correct  probe  chromosome  band  location,  probe  sensitivity,  probe  specificity,  assay 
accuracy, assay reproducibility and normal range were described and evaluated in the specific validation 
assay. The validation report showed good performance of the method when considers the above mentioned 
parameters. 
Results 
Ctrough values are shown in the following table. 
Table 3: Pre-Dose Concentrations (Ctrough) of Crizotinib in ROS1-Positive NSCLC Patients (PKP_Ctrough 
Population) 
These data show that steady-state was reached by Day 15, which is consistent with the t1/2 of the drug (42 
h). Asian patients generally had higher Ctrough,ss values than non-Asian patients (see table below), which 
is consistent with previous findings (please also refer to Xalkori EPAR).

The  distribution  of  Ctrough,ss  values  among  crizotinib-treated  patients  with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  was 
similar to that observed for crizotinib-treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC enrolled in a separate cohort 
of Study 1001.

(Ctrough,ss) of Crizotinib in Patients with ROS1-Positive NSCLC (Left) Versus Patients with 
ALK-Positive NSCLC (Right) in Study 1001 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH investigated the exposure to crizotinib in ROS1-positive NSCLC after repeated administration of the 
standard 250 mg BID dose. Taking into account that no significant difference in the PK can be expected 
between ROS1-positive and ALK-positive NSCLC patients, comparison of Ctrough values was adequate in 
order to confirm a similar exposure in the two patient subsets.  
Comparative data show that crizotinib exposures were comparable in patients with either ROS1-positive or 
ALK-positive NSCLC, as expected. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The current data show that exposure is similar in both ROS1-positive and ALK-positive NSCLC patients. No 
changes to the pharmacokinetic characteristics described in the SmPC are recommended.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data is based on results from the ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort of the study A8081001, 
whose data in ALK-positive NSCLC were pivotal for the initial approval in previously treated patients.  
Overall, efficacy data have been provided for 53 patients, including 50 patients who were in the 
ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort and 3 additional patients initially included in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort 
and, after enrolment, retrospectively determined to have ROS1-positive NSCLC.  
To provide the context for the obtained efficacy results, supportive information on the natural history of 
ROS1-positive NSCLC, results from recently published retrospective/prospective analyses in ROS1-positive 
NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib, and data on response to previous systemic standard treatments 
observed in patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC, have been also submitted. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The recommended starting dose for treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC is 250 mg 
orally BID continuously. This dosing regimen was determined from the dose-escalation phase of Study 1001 
and was confirmed in the dose-expansion phase of Study 1001, where both the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) and RP2D were determined to be 250 mg BID. Patients with a variety of advanced cancers, including 
ROS1-positive NSCLC, were included in the dose expansion phase of Study 1001 and received the crizotinib 
RP2D of 250 mg BID (see initial marketing authorization EPAR).  
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study A8081001: Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of 
PF-02341066, a C-Met/HGFR selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, administered orally to patients 
with advanced cancer. 
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study originally designed to include an initial dose-escalation 
phase, followed by an expansion phase in which the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in the 
initial phase would be evaluated in molecularly defined cohorts of patients. Through a protocol amendment, 
an expansion RP2D cohort of ROS1-positive NSCLC patients was included (see below in the Section “Conduct 
of the study”).

The ROS1 rearrangement testing was performed by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or by a local 
laboratory using a FISH assay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For the MGH 
laboratory-developed test, on enumeration of 50 nuclei, a tissue sample was classified as negative if <15% 
of nuclei (7 nuclei or fewer) were positive for gene rearrangement and classified as positive if >15% (8 
nuclei or more) were positive. If more than 50 nuclei were enumerated, a sample was classified as positive 
if ≥15% of nuclei were positive. For the 3 patients enrolled in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort, the ROS1 
rearrangement testing by FISH was performed retrospectively by MGH. 
Treatments 
Crizotinib was administered at the standard dose of 250 mg BID in continuous 28-day cycles (or 21-day 
cycles for the 3 ROS1-positive patients enrolled in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort). 
Treatment  was  continued  until  the  occurrence  of  RECIST-defined  disease  progression  or  clinical 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity effects, withdrawal from the study or death.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the overall study applicable to patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC were to determine the 
antitumor activity, and the PK and safety profile of crizotinib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints to evaluate the antitumor activity of crizotinib in patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC were 
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DR), Time to Response 
(TTR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to progression (TTP), Overall Survival (OS) and probability of 
survival at 6 and 12 months. The definition of each endpoint is reported in the Table on Summary of Efficacy 
for trial A8081001. 
All efficacy analyses dependent on disease assessments (ORR, DCR, DR, TTR, PFS and TTP) were based on 
the derived investigator assessment of tumour data. 
Best overall response (BOR) was derived per RECIST version 1.0 (ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort) or version 
1.1  (the  3  patients  in  the  ALK-negative  NSCLC  cohort  who  were  retrospectively  determined  to  be 
ROS1-positive). This derived tumour assessment was based on the target lesion measurements, non-target

lesion  assessments,  and  new  lesion  records  provided  by  the  investigator,  independent  of  the  overall 
response category provided by the investigator.  
In addition, an independent radiology review (IRR), consisting of sequential locked reads by two radiologists 
blinded  to  outside  radiology  reports  and  investigator  assessments,    was  performed  by  an  independent 
third-party core imaging laboratory. Adjudication of the best response was to be performed and in case of 
discrepancies  in  this  variable  between  the  two  radiologists,  a  third  radiologist  had  to  determine  the 
interpretation (Reader 1, Reader 2, or a third interpretation) to be used in the analyses. 
Tumour assessments were to be performed by the investigators every second cycle (every 8 weeks in the 
ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort and every 6 weeks in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort) until RECIST-defined 
disease progression. Only areas of known disease were to be assessed unless other sites of disease were 
suspected. Once a patient had completed 15 cycles, tumour assessments could have been performed every 
4 cycles (every 16 weeks in the ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort and every 12 weeks in the ALK-negative NSCLC 
cohort). Following Protocol Amendment 20 (see below the Section Conduct of the study) and once a patient 
had completed 24 cycles (35 cycles in the ALK negative NSCLC cohort), tumour imaging could have been 
performed every 24 weeks (every sixth cycle in the ROS1-positive NSCLC cohort and every eighth cycle in 
the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort). All tumour responses were to be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the initial 
response.  
Follow-up  survival  data  were  to  be  collected  at  least  every  3  months  after  discontinuing  crizotinib  for  a 
minimum of 1 year after the final dose. 
Sample size 
To evaluate the crizotinib anti-tumour activity in ROS1-positive NSCLC patients, a sample size including 
approximately 30 patients (of whom 27 evaluable) was originally planned. An ORR of 10% was considered 
to be uninteresting for further study for this cohort with 30% considered interesting for further exploration. 
With 27 evaluable patients, there is at least 85% power to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than 
or equal to 0.10 vs. the alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate 
of 0.30 with a one-sided alpha=0.05 using a single stage design. The null hypothesis was to be rejected in 
case of greater than or equal to 6 objective responses observed among the initially 27 evaluable patients. 
The sample size was subsequently increased to a total of 50 patients in order to provide a more robust 
estimation of efficacy in this patient population (Protocol Amendment #20).

Statistical methods 
Analyses of ORR, DR, TTR and DCR were to be performed in the Response Evaluable (RE) population. The 
Safety Analysis Population (SA) population was to be used for the analyses of PFS and OS. There was no 
planned formal statistical hypothesis testing. 
The point estimates of the rates of binary endpoints (i.e, ORR and DCR) were to be provided along with the 
corresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals using the exact method based on the F-distribution. 
For  continuous  endpoints,  such  as  DR  and  TTR,  descriptive  statistics,  including  the  mean,  standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values, were provided. The number and percentage of patients 
in each category (defined by time interval) were presented for categorical variables.

Time-to-event endpoints, including DR, PFS, TTP and OS, were to be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and displayed graphically when appropriate. Median event times (and other quartiles) and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each quartile were to be provided.  
No formal interim analysis was planned. The final analysis was to be performed after the last patient last 
visit. However, earlier data analyses may be performed for publication and regulatory reporting purposes. 
For  the  purposes  of  efficacy  analyses,  three  groups  were  to  be  used,  as  appropriate:  1)  ROS1-positive 
NSCLC,  including  all  patients  in  the  ROS1-positive NSCLC  cohort  (50  patients)  plus  the  3  ROS1-positive 
patients in the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort; 2) ROS1-positive NSCLC Cohort, including the 50 patients who 
were enrolled into this group; 3) ROS1-positive NSCLC Cohort (First 27 evaluable patients), includes the first 
27 evaluable patients enrolled into the ROS1-positive NSCLC Cohort for the planned test of the hypothesis 
specified in the main SAP. 
For analyses using group #1, tumour assessments are based on RECIST 1.0 except for the 3 patients from 
ALK-Negative Cohort for whom RECIST 1.1 is used. 
The best overall response and objective response rate were summarized for each of the 3 above groups. 
Analysis of DCR at weeks 8 and 16, DR, TTR, PFS, PFS at week 6, TTP, OS and OS at 6 and 12 months were 
to be summarized separately for ROS1-positive NSCLC patients (group #1 above) and the ROS1-positive 
NSCLC Cohort (group #2 above).

All 53 patients had advanced NSCLC (either Stage III or IV) at baseline, with a median time since diagnosis 
of  1.16  (0.0  to  11.2)  years.  All  patients  presented  with  measurable  disease  and  adequate  baseline 
assessments. 
For ROS1-positive NSCLC patients in Study 1001 (N=53), the median duration of treatment was 101 weeks. 
Diagnostic Marker Test Results 
Due to additional follow up information related to 2 patients  that were identified as ROS1-positive via a MGH 
research  ROS1  FISH  assay  rather  than  the  clinically-validated  MGH  laboratory-developed  test,  a  second 
snapshot of Marker test data was taken on 30 April 2015:

NSCLC) - Safety Analysis Population 
Available tissue samples (n=37 from 36 patients) were retrospectively tested for ALK gene rearrangement. 
One patient with a ROS1 rearrangement identified by FISH testing at MGH, an atypical hybridization pattern 
was  noted  (isolated  5′  green  signal),  and  next-generation  sequencing  subsequently  revealed  normal, 
non-rearranged ROS1. In a second patient the tumour was positive for both ROS1 and ALK rearrangement 
based  on  FISH,  but  next-generation  sequencing  revealed  only  an  EML4-ALK  fusion  and  no  ROS1 
rearrangement. None of the other available tumour tissue samples (n=36 from 35 patients) tested for ALK 
were positive. 
Two patients, both previously treated with systemic therapy before crizotinib, were not ROS1 positive based 
on next-generation sequencing.  
Among 16 ROS1-positive tumours tested for c-Met amplification by FISH or other testing methodologies, 
only 1 was determined to be positive based on a c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (MET)/centromere 7 (CEP7) 
ratio of 1.8, meeting the criteria for the Low Level c-Met Gene Amplified category (MET/CEP7 ratio ≥1.8 to

Numbers analysed 
The analysis populations defined for the efficacy evaluations of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 
1001 were: 
Safety Analysis (SA) Population (53 patients): all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib. 
This was the primary population for patient characteristics, and analyses of PFS, TTP, OS and safety. 
Response-Evaluable (RE) Population (53 patients): all patients in the SA population who had an adequate 
baseline disease assessment. In addition, for this and any interim reporting of the data, patients also needed 
to meet 1 of the following 2 criteria: (1) had at least one post-baseline disease assessment at least 6 weeks 
from first dose of crizotinib or (2) withdrew from the study or experienced progressive disease/death at any 
time on study. This was the primary population for analyses of ORR, DR, time to tumour response (TTR), and 
disease control rate (DCR).

Of the 42 patients with available data, the mean percentage of ROS1-positive cells was 19.0% for the 2 
patients with a CR and 64.1% for the 27 patients with a PR. The mean percentages of ROS1-positive cells for 
patients with stable disease/no response and objective progression were 59.8% and 34.0%, respectively. Of 
note, the results based on ROS1 rearrangement testing performed by MGH were consistent with the overall

Supportive study(ies) 
No additional study was conducted by the MAH with crizotinib in ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.  
However, in order to provide context for the efficacy results, the MAH presented data on the natural history 
of  ROS1-positive  NSCLC,  results  from  recently  published  retrospective/prospective  analyses  of 
ROS1-positive NSCLC patients who received crizotinib, and data on response to previous systemic standard 
treatments from patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC.  
ROS1-positive NSCLC Natural History 
Information  is  currently  limited,  but  several  retrospective  analyses  describing  the  natural  history  of 
ROS1-positive NSCLC have been published (Bergethon et al, 2012; Yoshida et al, 2013; Cai et al, 2013; 
Chen et al, 2014; Lee, Seol, Kim et al, 2013; Fu et al, 2015; Scheffler et al, 2015; Jin et al, 2015). 
Several limitations, including the small number of patients (4 to 33 patients) and the differences in patients 
baseline characteristics, ROS1 testing methodology and definition of the ROS1-negative comparison group, 
need to be taken into account. 
Scheffler  et  al,  2015  reported  that  OS  was  significantly  better  (p-value=0.005)  in  14  patients  with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC compared to that of 115 patients with ROS1-negative NSCLC (median OS of 36.7 
months  and  17.5  months,  respectively).  It  is  important  to  note  that  5  out  of  the  14  patients  with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC in this report received crizotinib which could have confounded the observed result. 
In the analysis by Cai et al, 2013 a significantly shorter OS (p-value=0.041) was reported for 8 patients with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC, none of whom were treated with crizotinib, compared to 384 ROS1-negative NSCLC 
patients (median OS of 32 months and 54 months, respectively). 
Bergethon et al, 2012 reported no significant difference (p-value=0.42) in median OS for 18 patients with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC (663 days) compared to the median OS for 1055 patients with ROS1-negative NSCLC 
(607  days).  No  significant  difference  in  OS  for  4  to  33  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  patients  and  144  to  1055 
ROS1-negative NSCLC patients was reported by 5 additional studies  (Yoshida et al, 2013; Chen et al, 2014; 
Fu et al, 2015; Lee, Seol, & Kim et al, 2013; Jin et al, 2015). 
Supportive data on patients with ROS1-Positive NSCLC who received crizotinib 
The high ORR observed in Study 1001 (69.8%, 95% CI: 55.7, 81.7) was independently supported by 3 
recent publications.  
The  European  Study  of  ROS1  Patients  (EUROS1)  Cohort  of  a  European  retrospective  study  included  31 
patients  with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  who  received  crizotinib  therapy  through  individual  off-label  use 
(Mazieres  et  al,  2015).  In  this  study,  all  but  1  patient  had  received  at  least  1  prior  line  of  standard 
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and the ORR was 80% (calculated-not reported in publication 95% CI: 
61, 92).  
In a retrospective analysis, ORR in 5 patients who received crizotinib after 1-8 lines of prior therapies was 
100% (calculated- not reported in publication 95% CI: 48,100) (Scheffler et al, 2015).  
The results of a prospective investigator-initiated study (secured access [AcSé]) of 24 evaluable patients 
who received crizotinib after 1-12 lines of treatment showed an ORR of 63% (95% CI: 41, 81) (Moro-Sibilot 
et al, 2015).  
The results from these 3 independent studies help to substantiate ROS1-positive NSCLC as a molecularly 
selected indication for crizotinib. 
In Study 1001 for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC, the median PFS on crizotinib treatment was 19.3 
months (95% CI: 14.8, NR), with 40% of patients remaining in follow-up for progression at the time of the 
data cutoff. In the EUROS1 retrospective analysis, the median PFS was reported as 9.1 months with 60% of

patients still receiving treatment at the time of analysis (Mazieres et al, 2015). While it is unknown why there 
is an apparent difference in median PFS value between Study 1001 and EUROS1, this may be due to the 
length of follow-up, number of lines of prior therapies (approximately twice as many patients in the EUROS1 
study received 3 or more lines of therapy prior to receiving crizotinib than in Study 1001), and the smaller 
sample size of EUROS1 analysis. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
An extension of crizotinib indication for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC is 
requested by the MAH based on efficacy data from 53 patients treated in Study A8081001 (referred to as 
study 1001). At the time of the initial MAA, further investigation on the role of the ROS1 status in ALK- 
negative patients was requested as post-approval recommendation.  
ROS1 positivity is expected in around 1%-2% of NSCLC patients. Due to the limited and in some cases 
conflicting results provided by retrospective analyses, it is not possible to conclude on the prognostic value 
of ROS1 positivity. Thus the rational and benefit of a therapy selectively addressing ROS1-positive NSCLC 
patients is at present not fully evaluable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy data have been collected in the expansion phase of the ongoing, open-label, phase I study 1001 in 
which several cohorts of patients, including ROS1-positive NSCLC, received crizotinib at the 250 mg twice 
daily dose (500 mg daily), already recommended for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Several  CE-marked  test  for  in  vitro  diagnostic,  utilizing  platforms  such  as  FISH,  RT-PCR  and  NGS  are 
available for detection of ROS1 positivity in Europe. 
Similarly to what was observed for NSCLC ALK-positive patients, ROS-1 positive NSCLC patients are typically 
young, non-smokers and with adenocarcinoma histology. More than half of the patients enrolled in study 
1001 were female. Median age  was 55 years; patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or  1 
(98%) or 2 (2%) and 75% were never smokers. The disease characteristics were 91% metastatic, 96% 
adenocarcinoma histology. Overall, 7 out of 53 (13.2%) ROS1-positive NSCLC patients previously untreated 
with systemic therapy for advanced disease received crizotinib in Study 1001.  
The  benefit  observed  in  terms  of  ORR  (69.8%,  95%CI:  55.7,  81.7)  is  outstanding  and  supported  by  a 
meaningful  duration  of  response.  Six  out  the  7  previously  untreated  patients  achieved  an  objective 
response. Patients tended to respond early, with a median time to response of 7.9 weeks (i.e. the 1st tumour 
re-assessment) although some late responses (up to 32 weeks) were also observed.  
These data favourably compare with response to prior therapy for the 46 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC 
who  received  prior  treatment  for  their  advanced  disease  in  study  1001.  The  ORR  was  21.7%  for  prior 
first-line chemotherapy (29.4% with pemetrexed), 16.7% for prior second-line chemotherapy (30.8% with 
pemetrexed), and 23.7% for any line therapy with pemetrexed. Responses to prior treatment in patients 
with ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 1001 were comparable to those reported for unselected NSCLC patients 
treated with standard therapy (9-35% across first-line and second-line treatments (Scagliotti et al, 2002; 
Schiller et al, 2002; Hanna et al, 2004; Herbst et al, 2004; Herbst et al, 2005; Sandler et al, 2006; Scagliotti 
et al, 2009).  
At  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff,  the  median  PFS  was  19.3  months  (95%  CI:  14.8,  NR)  and  although  the 
median OS had not yet been reached, the probability of survival at 12 months was 79.0% (95% CI: 65.3, 
87.8).

A  statistical  analysis  was  also  provided  in  which  TTP  on  crizotinib  was  compared  with  TTP  on  last  prior 
therapy: the median TTP with crizotinib vs last prior therapy was 19.8 vs 8.1 months (HR=0.59, 95% CI: 
0.31, 1.13). Although not statistically significant, there was a numerical decrease in the risk of progression 
with crizotinib compared with last prior therapy. 
Subgroup analysis of clinical efficacy based on specific ROS1 rearrangements was not performed in Study 
1001 because the FISH assay, used to detect rearrangements involving the ROS1 gene, does not identify 
specific  ROS1  fusion  partners.  However,  tumour  responses  and  the  duration  of  crizotinib  treatment  in 
patients  with  specific  ROS1  fusion  partners  detected  using  alternative  testing  methods  were  evaluated 
(Shaw  et  al,  N  Engl  J  Med  2014).  Targeted  NGS  or  an  RT-PCR  assay  was  used  to  identify  ROS1  fusion 
partners  in  available  tumour  samples  from  25  of  the  50  patients  who  were  in  the  ROS1-positive  NSCLC 
cohort.  Seven  different  ROS1  fusion  partners  were  identified.  Tumour  responses  (based  on  the  derived 
tumour assessment) appeared to be independent of the ROS1 fusion partner. There was also no apparent 
relationship between the duration of treatment and the specific ROS1 rearrangement for the 25 patients in 
whom ROS1 fusion partners were identified using an NGS or RT-PCR assay. No conclusion can be drawn 
regarding the relationship between ROS1 fusion partner and crizotinib activity. 
To  support  the  clinical  efficacy  of  crizotinib 
in  ROS1-positive  NSCLC,  published  data 
from 
Investigator-Initiated Research studies were discussed by the MAH.  
However, seemingly conflicting results have been published in terms of objective response to prior therapy 
for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. In the EUROS1 retrospective study (Mazieres et al, 2015), for the 26 
patients who received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, the ORR was 58% (not reported, calculated 95% 
CI: 37, 77). These results are difficult to interpret because patients received pemetrexed either alone or in 
combination  with  platinum  agents  and  either  before  or  after  receiving  crizotinib.  Scheffler  et  al,  2015 
reported  that  9  out  of  14  (64%)  ROS1-positive  patients  had  at  least  1  radiological  response  to 
chemotherapy, with 4 out of 5 (80%, calculated- not reported in publication 95% CI: 28, 99) patients having 
radiological  response  to  pemetrexed-containing  regimens.  These  results  are  also  difficult  to  interpret 
because the definition of radiological response was not specified in the latter publication, and the sample size 
is especially limited in this retrospective analysis.  
Lower responses in terms of PFS were observed in the largest of these three trials compared to Study 1001. 
Information regarding TTP/PFS with standard therapies is available from the literature only for the EUROS1 
retrospective analysis in which median PFS with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was 7.2 months (95% 
CI: 4.8 to 9.6 months) (Mazieres et al, 2015). 
Data from previously untreated patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 1001 (7 patients) is considered 
limited.  However  there  are  significant  parallels  between  ALK-fusion  positive  and  ROS1-fusion  positive 
NSCLC. ROS1 oncogene encodes an orphan RTK related to ALK, leukocyte RTK, and members of the insulin 
receptor family (Acquaviva et al, 2009). In both patient segments, genetic translocation events lead to gene 
fusions that result in deregulated expression of the respective kinase domain, ALK or ROS1, with consequent 
constitutive activation of the kinase activity (Soda et al, 2007; Rikova et al, 2007; Takeuchi et al, 2012). 
Collectively,  these  data  indicate  that  the  biology  of  ALK-  and  ROS1  fusions  in  NSCLC  is  in  many  ways 
analogous. 
The antitumor activity in first line setting suggested in Study 1001 for ALK-positive NSCLC patients was 
subsequently  corroborated  by  the  results  of  a  randomized  Phase  3  study  (crizotinib  vs  chemotherapy  in 
previously  untreated  [Study 1014]  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC)  which  clearly  demonstrated  that 
crizotinib provided statistically significant, robust, and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR in 
this patient population.

Thus, based on the pre-clinical and anti-tumour similarities between ALK-positive NSCLC and ROS1-positive 
NSCLC, there is no concern regarding the efficacy of crizotinib in the first line treatment of patients with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Available  data  are  considered  to  sufficiently  support  the  efficacy  of  crizotinib  in  ROS-1  NSCLC  patients 
regardless of the line of treatment. Results from the cohort of 53 ROS1- positive NSCLC patients are included 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  crizotinib  safety  profile  reported  across  clinical  studies  in  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC  patients  is 
mainly  characterized  by  vision  disorder,  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, 
constipation),  General  disorders  (oedema  and  fatigue),  elevated  transaminases,  decreased  appetite, 
dizziness, and neuropathy. 
In this application, the safety analysis (SA)  population includes 53 ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated in 
the Study 1001 whose data were submitted to support the extension of indication in this target population.  
A  pooled  safety  analysis  in  a  total  of  1722  patients,  including  1669  ALK-positive  and  53  ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC, was presented to support the proposed changes of the Xalkori SmPC . 
Patient exposure 
At the time of the data cutoff date (30 November 2014), the median duration of crizotinib treatment was 
23.2 months (95% CI: 15.0, NR), with 47.2% of patients still actively receiving crizotinib.  
Overall, median relative dose intensity was 99.0% (range: 70.1% to 100.0%). In total, 28 patients had a 
dose interruption (any missed dose for more than 1 day in a cycle), that was at maximum of less than 1 week 
for 13 (46.4%) patients. In total, 7 (13.2%) patients had a dose reduction below 500 mg/day lasting more 
than 1 day. 
In general, the baseline demographic characteristics of patients in the SA population of Study 1001 were 
consistent with those of the 1669 ALK+ positive NSCLC:

Adverse events 
 Registered AEs were coded according to MedDRA version 17.1. A summary of reported AEs is shown in the 
following Table: 
Table 28: Treatment-Emergent AEs (All-Causality and Treatment-Related, ROS1-Positive NSCLC) - Safety

Because some frequency may have been underestimated by reliance on single Preferred Term (PT), certain 
PTs  were  analyzed  in  aggregate  using  clustered  terms  (presented  in  capital  letters).  Not  all  MedDRA 
preferred terms within each clustered term were actually reported in this study.

*upon  further  clinical  review,  these  preferred  terms  or  clustered  terms  were  only  included  within  the  source  tables  and  not  further 
discussed by the applicant. 
All  AEs  of  special  interest  were  analysed  for  time  to  first  onset,  duration,  and  prevalence,  except  for 
prevalence  of  Electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged  since  ECGs  were  only  required  for  the  first  2  cycles  of 
crizotinib treatment. 
Elevated transaminases and hepatotoxicity 
All-causality elevated transaminases were reported for 19 (35.8%) patients, including 2 (3.8%) patients 
with Grade 3 event. No Grade 4 or 5 AEs were reported. There were no AEs of hepatotoxicity. 
Treatment-related  elevated  transaminases  events  were  reported  for  16  (30.2%)  patients,  including  2 
(3.8%) patients Grade 3. There were no SAEs treatment-related. The median time to first onset was 17.5 
days (range: 7 to 442 days), with a median duration of 99 days (range: 7 to 1088 days). The prevalence of 
treatment-related elevated transaminases was highest during the Weeks 1 to 4 interval (17.0%) and then 
remained relatively constant during all subsequent 4-week intervals through Week 24 (10.9% to 15.4% of 
patients). 
Based on laboratory measurements, shifts from Grade ≤2 to Grade 3/4 were seen for 3 (5.7%) patients for 
ALT and 2 (3.8%) patients for AST. Treatment-related elevated transaminases were associated with dose 
reduction for 2 (3.8%) patients, one of whom also had temporary treatment discontinuation. There was no 
permanent treatment discontinuation and no potential Hy’s Law cases were identified.  
Interstitial lung disease 
All-causality  event  Grade  1  (not  serious)  was  reported  in  1  (1.9)  patient.  This  event  was  considered 
treatment-related. Time to onset was 112 days, with a duration of 8 days. This event was associated with 
temporary treatment discontinuation for 7 days, but was not associated with dose reduction or permanent 
treatment discontinuation. 
Across studies in patients with either ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC (N=1722), 50 (3%) patients 
treated with crizotinib had any grade all-causality ILD, including 18 (1%) patients with Grade 3 or 4, and 
8 (<1%)  patients  with  fatal  cases.  According  to  an  independent  review  committee  (IRC)  assessment  of 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (N=1669), 20 (1.2%) patients had ILD/pneumonitis, including 10 (<1%) 
patients with fatal cases. These cases generally occurred within 3 months after the initiation of treatment. 
Electrocardiogram QT Prolonged 
All-causality event was reported for 2 (3.8%) patients, both of which were Grade 3 in severity. One of these 
(1.9%) was considered treatment-related. Time to onset was 15 days and duration was 1 day. This event 
was  associated  with  a  dose  reduction,  but  was  not  associated  with  temporary  or  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation. 
Across studies in patients with either ALK-positive or ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC, QTcF (corrected QT by 
the Fridericia method) ≥500 msec was recorded in 34 (2.1%) of 1619 patients with at least 1 postbaseline 
ECG assessment and a maximum increase from baseline in QTcF ≥60 msec was observed in 79 (5.0%) of 
1585  patients  with  a  baseline  and  at  least  1  postbaseline  ECG  assessment.  All-causality  Grade  3  or  4 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported in 27 (1.6%) out of 1722 patients (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Bradycardia 
All-causality event was reported for 14 (26.4%) patients, none of which were Grade ≥ 3  in severity. A Grade 
2 all-causality AE was reported for 1 (1.9%) patient. 
Treatment-related  events  were  reported  for  11  (20.8%)  patients.  One  (1.9%)  patient  had  a

treatment-related  SAE  (Grade  2)  which  was  associated  with  temporary  treatment  discontinuation.  The 
median time to first onset was 29.0 days (range: 15 to 929 days), with a median duration of 581 days 
(range: 5 to 1226 days). The prevalence of treatment-related bradycardia was lowest during the Weeks 1 to 
4 interval (9.4%) and was slightly increased in the subsequent 4-week intervals through Week 24 (13.5% to 
16.3%).  
A  minimum  on-study  pulse  rate  of  <50  bpm  was  reported  for  13/52  (25.0%)  patients  and  a  maximum 
decrease in pulse rate from baseline ≤30 bpm was reported for 19/52 (36.5%) patients. No patients had 
treatment-related  bradycardia  associated  with  dose  reduction  or  permanent  treatment  discontinuation. 
There  were  no  additional  patients  with  temporary  treatment  discontinuation  other  than  the  SAE  noted 
above. 
Across  all  studies  with  crizotinib  in  patients  with  either  ALK-positive  or  ROS1-positive  advanced  NSCLC, 
all-causality  bradycardia  was  experienced  by  219  (13%)  of  1722  patients  treated  with  crizotinib.  Most 
events were mild in severity. A total of 259 (16%) of 1666 patients with at least 1 postbaseline vital sign 
assessment had a pulse rate <50 bpm. 
Vision disorder 
All-causality event was reported for 46 (86.8%) patients, none of which were Grade ≥ 3 in severity. A Grade 
2 all-causality AE was reported for 1 (1.9%) patient. 
Events were considered treatment-related for 45 (84.9%) patients, and in 44 of them events were Grade 1 
in severity. No SAEs were registered. Of note, there were no AEs associated with severe visual loss. The 
median time to first onset was 8 days (range: 1 to 465 days), with a median duration was 297 days (range: 
7 to 1486 days). The prevalence of treatment-related vision disorder was highest during the Weeks 1 to 4 
interval (71.7%) and then gradually decreased over each 4-week interval through Week 24 (from 65.4% to 
54.3% of patients). 
Most  patients  did  not  have  new  findings/worsening  of  findings  when  ophthalmologic  examinations  were 
performed on-treatment; the most common (≥5%) new findings/worsening of findings were reported for 
biomicroscopic examination of the lens (15.1% of patients for both eyes), fundoscopic examination of the 
vitreous body (11.3% for both eyes), and fundoscopic examination of the fundus (5.3% for the left eye). 
There  was  no  temporary  treatment  discontinuation,  dose  reduction,  or  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation. 
All-causality, all grade, vision disorder, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, vision blurred, and 
vitreous  floaters,  was  experienced  by  1084  (63%)  of  1722  patients  treated  with  crizotinib.  Of  the  1084 
patients who experienced vision disorder, 95% had events that were mild in severity (see SmPC section 
4.8). 
Gastrointestinal events 
Gastrointestinal events, including Nausea,  Vomiting, Diarrhoea, and  Constipation, were among the most 
common all-causality and treatment-related AEs reported for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 
1001. The treatment-related AEs were primarily Grade 1 in severity.  
•  Nausea 
All-causality event was reported for 31 (58.5%) patients, none of which were Grade 4 or 5 in severity. A 
Grade 3 all-causality AE was reported for 1 (1.9%) patient. 
Treatment-related event was reported for 26 (49.1%) patients. There was no treatment-related Grade ≥ 3 
events  and  SAEs.  The  median  time  to  first  onset  was  2.5  days  (range:  1  to  932  days),  with  a  median 
duration of 87 days (range:1 to 1228 days). The prevalence of treatment-related Nausea was highest the 
Weeks 1 to 4 interval (39.6%) and decreased over the subsequent three 4-week interval through Week 16

(to 18.8% of patients) and remained constant for the next two 4-week intervals through Week 24 (19.6% of 
patients).  There  was  no  temporary  treatment  discontinuation  or  crizotinib  dose  reduction.  In  1  (1.9%) 
patient the treatment-related Nausea (Grade 2) was associated with permanent treatment discontinuation.  
•  Diarrhoea

were reported. The median time to first onset was 8 days (range: 1 to 490 days), with a median duration of 
37 days (range: 1 to 814 days). The prevalence of the event was highest during the Weeks 1 to 4 interval 
(20.8%) and remained relatively constant during the subsequent 4-week intervals through Week 24 (10.4% 
to  15.2%).  Treatment-related  Vomiting  was  associated  with  temporary  treatment  discontinuation  for  3 
(5.7%) patients.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
All-causality SAEs were reported in 22 (41.5%) patients, and the most common (≥ 2 patients) events were, 
in decreasing order, Disease Progression (9 patients, 19%), Pneumonia (3 patients, 5.7%), Headache (2 
patients, 3.8%) and Nausea (2 patients, 3.8%). 
Treatment-related  SAEs  were  bradycardia  and  Gastrointestinal  amyloidosis,  each  reported  in  1  (1.9%) 
patient.  
Regarding the Gastrointestinal amyloidosis SAE, the condition may have been present prior to treatment 
start.  The  symptoms  were  resolved  by  supportive  therapy  and  did  not  recur  after  crizotinib  was 
re-administered. The investigator assessed the causality between the event and crizotinib as 'unknown'. The 
MAH  considers  there  is  no  sufficient  evidence  to  suggest  a  causal  relationship  between  crizotinib  and 
Gastrointestinal amyloidosis in this patient. 
Deaths 
At  the  data  cut-off  date,  16  deaths  were  reported,  including  7  patients  who  died  28  days  after  the  last 
crizotinib dose.

All the 9 deaths occurred within 28 days of last treatment dose were due to disease under study. No death 
was considered related to crizotinib by either the investigator or the MAH. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Shifts from Grade ≤2 to Grade 3/4 were observed for absolute neutrophils (9.4% of patients), absolute 
lymphocytes (7.5%), and white blood cells (1.9%). 
Table 37: Shift Table of Haematology Laboratory Results From Grade ≤2 to Grade 3/4 (All Cycles, 
ROS1-Positive NSCLC) - Safety Analysis Population 
Across studies in patients with either ALK-positive or ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC (N=1722), Grade 3 or 
4 neutropenia was observed in 212 (12%) patients treated with crizotinib. Median time to onset of any grade 
neutropenia was 89 days. Neutropenia was associated with dose reduction or permanent treatment 
discontinuation for 3% and <1% of patients, respectively (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Chemistry 
The  most  common  (≥2%  of  patients)  shifts  from  Grade  ≤2  to  Grade  3/4  were  observed  for 
hypophosphatemia (15.1% of patients), ALT (5.7%), AST (3.8%), and hyponatremia (3.8%).

Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data in ROS1-positive NSCLC patients have been submitted (crizotinib received the FDA 
approval after the submission of this extension of indication application). 
Based  on  the  most  recent  PSUR  (#7),  cumulatively  through  25  August  2015,  it  is  estimated  that  2835 
patients participated in the crizotinib clinical development program, including 2151 that were exposed to 
crizotinib as a single agent, 139 treated with crizotinib as part of a combination or crossover regimen, 205 
that received blinded-therapy, and 340 that received active comparator drugs. It is estimated from post 
marketing experience that 18,689 patients have received crizotinib. 
Signals  reviewed  for  crizotinib  during  the  reporting  interval  included  cardiac  failure  and  renal  toxicity.  A 
retrospective investigation of the possible effect of crizotinib on renal function was completed and based on 
this review, it was determined that blood creatinine increased is an ADR of crizotinib. After the database for 
this PSUR was locked, cardiac failure was added as an ADR and as an important identified risk for crizotinib 
in the EU as per PRAC request.  
Important  identified  risks  for  crizotinib  at  the  beginning  of  the  reporting  period  were  hepatotoxicity, 
pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease, QTc prolongation, bradycardia, vision disorder, oedema, leukopenia, 
neuropathy,  renal  cyst,  and  gastrointestinal  perforation.  Gastrointestinal  perforation  is  considered  an 
important identified risk in the EU.

Important potential risks were reproductive toxicity, photosensitivity, and malignant melanoma. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The crizotinib safety profile in the ROS1-positive NSCLC population is based on data from the 53 patients 
treated in Study 1001. Most of these patients (67.9%) received crizotinib for longer than 12 months, and the 
median  treatment  duration  was  23.2  months  (95%  CI:  15.0,  NR),  with  approximately  half  of  patients 
(47.2%) still on treatment at the data cut-off date (30 November 2014).  
Overall, similar baseline demographic characteristics in terms of gender, age and smoking behaviour were 
observed in patients with ROS1-positive or ALK-positive NSCLC. 
No new safety concerns were raised by data from these additional 53 patients. The known crizotinib safety 
profile,  mainly  characterized  by  Vision  disorder,  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, 
constipation), and General disorders (oedema and fatigue) was confirmed in ROS1-positive patients.  
Hypophosphataemia and Neutropaenia were the most common Grade 3 treatment-related AEs (13.2% and 
9.4%,  respectively).  No  Grade  4  treatment-related AEs  as  well  as  death  considered  related  to  crizotinib 
treatment  were  registered.  Treatment-related  SAEs  were  bradycardia  and  gastrointestinal  amyloidosis, 
each reported by 1 (1.9%) patient.  
Toxicities experienced by ROS1-positive NSCLC patients were mostly manageable by short (<1 week) dose 
interruption and crizotinib dose reduction. Only in one patient treatment was permanently discontinued due 
to drug-related AE. 
In ROS1-positive NSCLC patients, some crizotinib ADRs, such as Vision disorder, Dizziness, Bradycardia and 
Rash, were observed at an increased frequency with a difference of ≥10% in comparison to ALK-positive 
NSCLC patients. However, the limited number of the ROS1-positive subgroup does not allow to draw any 
meaningful conclusion. 
Some  differences  in  frequencies  of  individual  ADRs  are  observed  between  the  ROS1-positive  and 
ALK-positive NSCLC populations. Of note, vision disorder, dizziness, bradycardia, and Rash were reported 
with higher frequency (difference of ≥10%) for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC than for patients with 
ALK-positive NSCLC. 
In  total  15  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  patients  older  than  65  years  were  included  in  Study  1001.  No  major 
differences in the frequency of toxicities can be observed compared to the group of younger patients, except 
for a most common treatment-related Dysgeusia (33.3% vs13.2%) and Nausea (66.7% vs 42.1%). 
As expected, in general, treatment-related events, in particular Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, Diarrhoea, 
Dizziness, Neutropenia and Decreased appetite were most commonly observed in Asian than in non-Asian 
patients. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  from  patients  with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC,  as  reported  AEs  and 
laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the established safety profile as described in the current Pfizer 
reference  product  label  information  for  crizotinib.  The  safety  profile  of  crizotinib  in  the  53  patients  with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC in Study 1001 was consistent with the known overall crizotinib safety profile.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that the RMP version 
7.1 (dated 13 June 2016) is acceptable. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex 
I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to 
h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Annex II. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable due to the limited proposed changes to 
the PI that do not significantly alter the readability of the approved document. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
An extension of crizotinib indication for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC is 
requested by the MAH based on efficacy data from 53 patients enrolled in the open-label, phase I study 
1001, including 46 previously treated and 7 untreated. 
Similarly to what observed for NSCLC ALK-positive patients, ROS-1 positive NSCLC patients are typically 
young, non-smokers and with adenocarcinoma histology. More than half of the patients enrolled in study 
1001 were female.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
An outstanding benefit in terms of ORR (69.8%, 95%CI 55.7, 81.7), supported by a meaningful duration of 
response, was observed. Six out the 7 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response.  
These data favourably compare with response to prior therapy for ROS-1 positive NSCLC patients enrolled in 
the study 1001. The ORR was 21.7% for prior first-line chemotherapy (29.4% with pemetrexed), 16.7% for 
prior  second-line  chemotherapy  (30.8%  with  pemetrexed),  and  23.7%  for  any  line  therapy  with 
pemetrexed. A statistical analysis was also provided in which TTP on crizotinib was compared with TTP on 
last prior therapy: the median TTP with crizotinib vs last prior therapy was 19.8 vs 8.1 months (HR=0.59, 
95% CI: 0.31, 1.13). Supportive published data from Investigator-Initiated Research studies were provided 
by the MAH. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Data  on  previously  untreated  ROS-1  NSCLC  patients  are  very  limited.  However,  pre-clinical  and  clinical 
ancillary data show efficacy both in ROS1 and ALK mutated patients including in first line setting 
Data on the prognostic value of ROS-1 positivity are sparse and difficult to interpret. Similarly, data from 
independent retrospective studies, are difficult to interpret, due to the heterogeneity in type of regimen and 
agents used, but seem to show an ORR to prior treatment similar or even higher than in study 1001.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new safety concerns were raised by data from these additional 53 patients. The known crizotinib safety 
profile,  mainly  characterized  by  Vision  disorder,  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, 
constipation), and General disorders (oedema and fatigue) was confirmed in ROS1-positive patients.  
Toxicities experienced by ROS1-positive NSCLC patients were mostly manageable by short (<1 week) dose 
interruption and crizotinib dose reduction. Only in one patient treatment was permanently discontinued due 
to drug-related AE. 
In  total  15  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  patients  older  than  65  years  were  included  in  Study  1001.  No  major 
differences in the frequency of toxicities can be observed compared to the group of younger patients, except 
for a most common treatment-related Dysgeusia (33.3% vs13.2%) and Nausea (66.7% vs 42.1%). 
As expected, in general treatment-related events, in particular Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, Diarrhoea, 
Dizziness, Neutropenia and Decreased appetite were most commonly observed in Asian than in non-Asian 
patients.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Advanced NSCLC remains a highly symptomatic and incurable disease requiring safer and more effective 
treatments in addition to those currently available. With the evolving understanding of the molecular basis 
of the disease, agents that target specific oncogenic driver alterations in subsets of patients have become an 
increasing focus of cancer drug development. ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements rarely occur in the same 
tumour, with each defining a unique molecular subgroup of NSCLC (Gainor and Shaw, 2013). ROS1-positive 
NSCLC  represents  an  additional  molecularly-defined  subgroup  which  may  be  effectively  treated  with  a 
specific targeted therapy  
Results from the cohort of ROS1-positive patients in Study 1001 indicate that crizotinib is an effective and 
safe treatment for this specific, rare subset of NSCLC. Crizotinib has shown robust and clinically meaningful 
antitumor  activity  as  a  single  agent  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  and  previously  treated 
ROS1-positive NSCLC, as shown by a high ORR with responses that were rapid and durable.

Benefit-risk balance 
The B/R of crizotinib as a single agent in the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The presented data from published literature regarding the natural history of ROS1-positive NSCLC suggest 
that ROS1 positivity is unlikely to be a favourable prognostic factor in NSCLC, similar to what has previously 
been shown in ALK-positive NSCLC (Shaw et al, 2009; Shaw et al, 2011). 
The activity of crizotinib in ROS1-positive patients is undisputable, at least in previously treated subjects. 
Results taken from study 1001 show that crizotinib is associated with an ORR of 69.8% (95% CI: 55.7, 81.7), 
including  five  (9.4%)  patients  with  a  confirmed  complete  response.  At  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff,  the 
median PFS was 19.3 months (95% CI: 14.8, NR) and although the median OS had not yet been reached, 
the probability of survival at 12 months was 79.0% (95% CI: 65.3, 87.8). 
There are limitations regarding the B/R assessment of crizotinib as a single agent in previously untreated 
patients mainly because of the non-comparative nature of the data and the limited sample size. However, 
since  ROS1  positive  NSCLC  represents  a  rare,  serious  and  life-threatening  distinct  molecular  subset  of 
NSCLC with no currently approved targeted therapies, pre-clinical and clinical ancillary data show efficacy 
both in ROS1 and ALK mutated patients (including efficacy in first line setting), a large indication including 
both pre-treated and non-pre-treated patient is considered acceptable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) based on the results of Study A8081001 (a multinational, multicenter, open-label, 
single-arm study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of crizotinib in 
patients with advanced cancer). Consequential changes are proposed to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 and the Package Leaflet is proposed to be updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Annex II. An updated RMP version 7.1 
was agreed during the procedure. 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product  
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of the product in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall agree 
the content and format of the educational material with the National Competent Authority. The final wording 
used on the educational material should be in line with the approved product information. 
The MAH should ensure that, at launch and thereafter, all Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) who are expected 
to use and/or prescribe XALKORI are provided with an educational pack. 
The educational pack should contain the following: 
1.  Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
2.  Educational material for Healthcare Professionals. 
3.  Patient brochure including a Patient Alert Card (text as agreed by the CHMP) 
The educational material for Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) should contain the following key elements: 
1.  XALKORI  prolongs  the  QTc  interval  which  may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  for  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias (e.g., Torsade de Pointes) or sudden death; 
2.  The risk of QTc prolongation may be increased in patients concomitantly taking anti-arrhythmics and 
in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances (e.g., 
secondary to diarrhoea or vomiting); 
3.  XALKORI should be administered with caution to patients: 
a.  Who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation; 
b.  Who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval; 
4.  The need for a periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered 
when using XALKORI in these patients; 
5.  Patients  who  develop  a  Grade  3  QTc  prolongation  should  stop  taking  XALKORI  until  recovery  to 
Grade ≤1, then resume at 200 mg twice daily; 
6.  Patients who develop a Grade 4 QTc prolongation should stop taking XALKORI permanently; 
7.  That  XALKORI  may  cause  vision  disorders,  including  Grade  4  visual  field  defect  with  vision  loss. 
However vision disorders most commonly observed were diplopia, photopsia, blurred vision, visual 
impairment, and vitreous floaters and were in most cases mild in severity; 
8.  In patients with ocular disorders, ophthalmological evaluation should be considered if vision disorder 
persists  or  worsens  in  severity.  In  the  case  of  patients  experiencing  severe  visual  loss  (best 
corrected  visual  acuity  less  than  6/60  in  one  or  both  eyes),  XALKORI  treatment  should  be 
discontinued and appropriate evaluation should be performed; 
9.  XALKORI  may  cause  hepatotoxicity,  symptomatic  bradycardia  (e.g.,  syncope,  dizziness, 
hypotension),  interstitial  lung  disease/pneumonitis,  neutropenia  and  leukopenia,  renal  cyst, 
oedema, neuropathy, and reproductive toxicity. Recommendations on how to mitigate these risks 
through appropriate monitoring and management to be provided; 
10. The concomitant use of XALKORI  with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 substrates 
with narrow therapeutic indices should be avoided;

11. That  XALKORI  might  cause  gastrointestinal  perforation.  Hence,  the  product  should  be  used  with 
caution in patients at risk of developing gastrointestinal perforation; and discontinued in patients 
who  experience  this  adverse  reaction.  Patients  should  be  informed  of  the  first  signs  of 
gastrointestinal  perforations  and  advised  to  consult  rapidly  the  treating  physician  in  case  of 
occurrence; 
12. That XALKORI might cause severe, life-threatening or fatal cardiac failure. Hence, patients with or 
without  pre-existing  cardiac  disorders,  receiving  crizotinib,  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and 
symptoms  of  heart  failure.  Dosing  interruption,  dose  reduction,  or  discontinuation  should  be 
considered as appropriate if such symptoms are observed; 
13. The need to counsel patients about risks related to the administration of XALKORI and inform them 
of what symptoms and signs to be aware of and the actions to take; 
14. The role and use of the Patient Alert Card.

Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study MenACWY-TT-052 is part of a clinical development program.  
A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of Neisseria 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Nimenrix was authorised on the 
20th of April 2012 for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and above against 
invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135 and Y. A 0.5 ml 
dose of the reconstituted vaccine is used in all ages. 
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study MenACWY-TT-052, which investigated the long-term 
antibody persistence of GSK Biologicals’ MenACWY-TT vaccine versus Menactra® in healthy 
adolescents/adults aged 10-25 years, and booster response to MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 5 
years post-primary vaccination. 
Clinical study (MenACWY-TT-052) 
Description 
MenACWY-TT-052 was a phase II, open, controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term 
antibody persistence at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the administration of one dose of MenACWY-
TT versus one dose of Sanofi-Pasteur’s meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid 
conjugate vaccine (Menactra®) in healthy adolescents/adults aged 10-25 years and to evaluate the 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No1901/2006 
EMA/200334/2015

safety and immunogenicity of a booster response to MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 5 years 
post-primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Menactra® and of a primary vaccination of MenACWY-
TT in a newly enrolled group aged 15-<31 years. 
The clinical study report supplied for this procedure presents the persistence results at 5 years (Month 
60) after primary vaccination in study 109377 (MenACWY-TT-052) and immunogenicity and safety up 
to six month after a booster or primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT administered at Month 60. 
Methods 
Study MenACWY-TT-059 was conducted in the United States. This study evaluated the immunogenicity 
induced by Nimenrix as compared to Menactra at 11-25 years of age in terms of the percentage of 
subjects with N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W -135 and Y titers ≥1:8 as measured by hSBA (using 
GSK hSBA assays). 
The study included 3 groups: 
• ACWY-TT: MenACWY-TT (11-25 years of age) 
• ACWY-DT: Menactra (11-25 years of age) 
• ACWY<11: MenACWY-TT (10-<11 years of age) 
At Year 5, an additional arm of vaccine-naïve 15-<31 year olds was added to receive MenACWY-TT. 
Subjects who received MenACWY-TT or Menactra in study MenACWY-TT-052 received a booster dose of 
MenACWY-TT at Year 5 (Month 60). 
The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term persistence of the immunogenicity induced by 
MenACWY-TT vaccine as compared to Menactra at 11-25 years of age in terms of the percentage of 
subjects with MenA, MenC, MenW-135, and MenY titers ≥1:8 as measured by a serum bactericidal 
assay using human complement (hSBA). 
Secondary objectives included measurement of antibody titers ≥1:4 and geometric mean titers 
(GMTs), evaluation of the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT vaccine when given 5 years after a priming 
dose compared to the immunogenicity in vaccine-naïve subjects. 
Results 
Persistence phase 
Of the 852 subjects in the MenACWY-TT-059 database, 540 did not come to the Year 5 persistence 
Visit 3, therefore the total cohort at Year 5 included 312 subjects (218 in the ACWY-TT group, 56 in the 
ACWY-DT group and 38 in the ACWY<11 group) who signed an informed consent and participated in 
the Year 5 blood draw. The According-to-Protocol (ATP) immunogenicity analysis for persistence at 
Year 5 contained 215 subjects (144 in the ACWY-TT group, 45 in the ACWY-DT group and 26 in the 
ACWY<11 group). In the majority of cases, the reasons for subjects not returning for the Year 5 
persistence study were: the subjects had been revaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine or the 
subjects were lost to follow-up. Other reasons fell under the categories of withdrawal of consent or 
migration to another area. 
Across all three vaccine groups the mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 
5 was 19.6 years (range 15 to 30 years) with a standard deviation of 3.32. The distribution of males 
and females was similar (51.6% male and 48.4% female). According to race, 47.4% were

White/Caucasian/European Heritage, 21.9% were Other and 10.7% were American Indian or Alaskan 
Native. 
Table 1. Summary of demographic characteristics (ATP cohort for persistence at Year 5) 
The analysis of the 5 year persistence was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence Year 5. 
Because the results for the blood samples taken at 1 month after administration of the vaccine and 1, 
3 and 5 years after vaccination are based on assays done at different times, comparisons of the 
kinetics of antibody titer calculations should be interpreted with caution. Note that having serological 
results 1 year and/or 3 years after primary vaccination was not an entry requirement for the Year 5 
persistence of study MenACWY-TT-059EXT:052. 
At five years following primary vaccination, the percentage of subjects with hSBA antibody titers ≥1:8 
was 48.9%, 92.9%, 87.0% and 94.4% for MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, respectively, in the 
ACWY-TT group, and 44.4%, 79.5%, 84.1% and 90.9% for MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, 
respectively, in the ACWY-DT group.

The percentage of subjects in the ACWY<11 group with hSBA titers ≥1:8 five years after vaccination 
was 37.5%, 84.6%, 92.3% and 92.3% for serogroups MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, 
respectively. 
The GMTs for MenW-135 and MenY at the Year 5 persistence timepoint remained above pre-
vaccination titers for all three groups. The GMTs for MenC remained above pre-vaccination titers for 
the ACWY-TT and ACWY<11 but dropped to almost pre-vaccination levels for the ACWY-DT group at 
the Year 5 persistence timepoint. In contrast, the MenA GMTs decreased markedly to almost baseline 
levels for all groups as soon as 1 year after primary vaccination. 
Since, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who came back for the Year 5 follow-up with 
serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the 
Total cohort at Year 5 was performed to complement the ATP analysis. The descriptive immunogenicity 
results for the Total cohort at Year 5 were generally consistent with the results for the ATP analysis.

Booster phase 
A total of 322 subjects received a booster (183 subjects in the ACWYBST group and 38 subjects in the 
ACWY-DT group) or primary vaccination (101 subjects in the ACWYPRI group). A total of 23 subjects 
did not complete the booster phase of the study and in the majority of the cases (18 subjects) this was 
due to the subject being lost to follow-up. The according-to-protocol immunogenicity analysis at Month 
61 contained 223 subjects (109 in the ACWYBST group, 29 in the ACWY-DT group and 85 in the 
ACWYPRI group). 
Across all three vaccine groups in the booster phase, the mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort 
for immunogenicity at Month 61 was 20.9 years (range 15 to 30 years) with a standard deviation of 
4.46. The distribution of males and females was 43.5% male and 56.5% female. According to race, 
44.8% were White/Caucasian/European Heritage, 17.0% were American Indian or Alaskan Native and 
13.5% were Other.

o  Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported for 3 (1.6%) subjects in the ACWYBST group during the 6 month period following 
booster vaccination and were not considered related to vaccination. All events (acute appendicitis, 
depression and malaria) had recovered/resolved by the end of the study with one event recovered but 
with sequelae (subject with depression). No SAEs were reported in the ACWY-DT or ACWYPRI groups. 
No SAEs were reported within the 31 days after booster vaccination. 
Table 9. Listing of SAEs reported following vaccination in the study MenACWY-TT-059 up to 
end of Extended Safety Follow-up (Total Vaccinated Cohort) 
No fatal SAEs were reported during the course of the study. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Data from Year 5 of the extension of the original MenACWY-TT-059 study are available from 312 
subjects. 852 subjects were randomised at baseline, and 487 returned for the Year 3 visit. Despite the 
limited number of subjects, particularly in the cohort who were aged under 11 years in the original 
vaccination phase, the data from Year 5 are consistent with those from Year 3, and generally show a 
persistence of effect against all four meningitis serogroups targeted by the vaccine. Although the MenA 
GMTs had dropped close to the pre-vaccination levels by12 months after vaccination, they continued to 
increase thereafter, up to Year 5. MenC GMTs declined between Years 3 and 5, but remained above 
baseline levels. The persistence of effect appears better with Nimenrix than with the comparator, 
Menactra.  
In the booster study, the effect of a Nimenrix booster in subjects originally vaccinated with Nimenrix 5 
years earlier in the original study was compared against that in subjects originally vaccinated with 
Menactra, and a cohort of vaccine-naïve subjects were administered a primary dose of Nimenrix as an 
additional comparison. A strong immunogenic response was observed in both booster groups, and no 
safety concerns were evident in the booster groups as compared with the vaccine-naïve group.  
III. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH has provided Year 5 persistence data from the MenACWY-TT-059 (EXT052) study, which are 
broadly consistent with data from Year 3 of the study. A booster at Year 5 elicited a strong 
immunogenic response. No new safety concerns are raised. 
The SmPC currently includes persistence data up to Year 3 from this study. This is acceptable.

1.  Introduction 
On 07 December 2023, the MAH submitted a completed study EP0126 for lacosamide, which included 
paediatric patients in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH submitted the study “Vimpat IV 100mg, Vimpat IV 200mg General drug use results 
surveillance” (EP0125) report is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lacosamide has been approved as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment in patients with 
partial-onset seizures (POS) in the EU (2 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and 
intravenous [iv] infusion), US (1 month of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv 
infusion), and Japan (4 years of age and older for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion). Lacosamide has 
also been approved as adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 
with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the EU (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution 
[syrup], and iv infusion), US (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv 
infusion), and Japan (for patients 4 years of age and older with epilepsy who have not obtained 
sufficient response to other antiseizure medications for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
• 
EP0126 and “Vimpat IV 100mg, Vimpat IV 200mg General drug use results surveillance” 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
EP0126 “Vimpat IV 100mg, Vimpat IV 200mg General drug use results 
surveillance” 
Description 
EP0126 was a post-marketing surveillance study intended to grasp the incidence of echocardiogram PR 
prolongation-related events during the actual post-marketing use of VIMPAT iv (hereafter referred to 
as “the Survey Drug”), evaluate differences in such incidence between infusion formulation and oral 
formulation, and obtain effectiveness information of the Survey Drug. 
EP0126 was conducted using a central registration system. Investigators registered patients, who 
newly initiated the administration/who were supposed to newly initiate the administration of the 
Survey Drug, during the period: 7 days before the initiation of the administration to the next day of 
the initiation of the administration. The observation period was from the date of the initiation of the 
administration to 2 weeks after the discontinuation of the Survey Drug. In case the administration of 
the Survey Drug was long, the maximum observation period was 1 month.

Methods 
Study participants 
The surveillance population included patients who were diagnosed with epilepsy, with POS (including 
secondary generalized seizures), who were 4 years or above on the start date of administration of the 
Survey Drug, and who had not used the Survey Drug in the past and received the Survey Drug as 
alternative to LCM oral formulations. 
EP0126 was conducted in Japan based on approved indications, dosage, and administration and 
included medical institutions where the Survey Drug had been delivered/adopted. A total of 
100 patients (including pediatric patients who were <18 years of age) were planned in the 
surveillance. 
Treatments 
Vimpat® IV 200 mg (hereinafter referred to as “the Survey Drug”). 
Objective(s) 
This surveillance is intended to grasp the incidence of Echocardiogram PR prolongation–related events 
during the actual post-marketing use of “Vimpat® IV 200 mg (hereinafter referred to as “the Survey 
Drug”)”, evaluation of differences in such incidence between infusion formulation and oral formulation, 
obtaining effectiveness information of the Survey Drug. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The safety specification and definition of data to be collected for this surveillance are summarized 
below. 
➢ Electrocardiogram PR prolongation-related events (atrioventricular block, bradycardia, syncope, 
etc.) 
Any events falling under the following MedDRA PTs: 
Arrhythmia supraventricular, atrial tachycardia, wandering pacemaker, atrial parasystole, Adams-
Stokes syndrome, atrioventricular block, atrioventricular block complete, atrioventricular block first 
degree, atrioventricular block second degree, conduction disorder, atrial conduction time prolongation, 
atrioventricular dissociation, inherited cardiac conduction disorder, anomalous atrioventricular 
excitation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, extrasystoles, nodal rhythm, parasystole, withdrawal arrhythmia, 
bradyarrhythmia, atrial septal defect, cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, dilatation atrial, 
myocardial fibrosis, atrial hypertrophy, left atrial hypertrophy, right atrial hypertrophy, right atrial 
dilatation, left atrial dilatation, cardiac steatosis (LLT: 10068130/ lipomatous hypertrophy of the 
interatrial septum), cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy alcoholic, ischaemic cardiomyopathy, stress 
cardiomyopathy and electrocardiogram PR prolongation. 
Effectiveness evaluations included: 
Status of epileptic seizure:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Presence/absence of seizures during the administration period of the Survey Drug 
Effectiveness evaluation: 
Evaluation was conducted at the time of discontinuation/1 month after the initiation of the 
administration of the Survey Drug by selecting “Effective” or “Ineffective”. 
Sample size 
A total of 100 patients (including pediatric patients who were <18 years of age) were planned in the 
surveillance. 
Results 
Baseline data 
There were 2 pediatric patients recruited. The age of epilepsy onset ranged from 6 years to 16 years, 
and the duration of disease ranged from 0.0 years to 4.9 years. Concomitant medication use was 
reported for both pediatric patients (See Table below).

Efficacy results 
There were 2 pediatric patients in the effectiveness analysis. The usefulness evaluation in both 
pediatric patients were judged to be effective (continued good seizure control), and there were no 
concerns regarding effectiveness, either by adjunctive therapy/monotherapy or by patient age. 
Due to the small sample size (n=2) and exploratory nature of the evaluations, the limited effectiveness 
data of the Survey Drug in pediatric patients does not provide a basis for adding any significant 
information in the EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT. 
Safety results 
There were 2 pediatric patients in the safety analysis. The duration of treatment for pediatric patients 
ranged from 2 days to 3 days. One pediatric patient had a start, daily average, and maximum LCM 
dose of 100mg, and 1 pediatric patient had a start, daily average, and maximum LCM dose of 50mg. 
No Survey Drug-related AEs were reported in either pediatric patient. 
An AE was reported for 1 of the 2 pediatric patients in the safety analysis. Details regarding the AE 
reported for the 1 pediatric patient are as follows:

The pediatric patient had an AE by preferred term of gastric haemorrhage starting on Day 1. Both the 
Investigator and the MAH considered the AE as nonserious and not related to the Survey Drug. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted the EP0126 study in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
(The Paediatric Regulation), since this surveillance study included also paediatric patients. 
There were 2 paediatric patients included into the study. Both patients received concomitant 
antiseizure medications. The MAH claimed good effectiveness in those patients in terms of seizure 
control. However, treatment was discontinued after 2 and 3 days. No reasons for discontinuation were 
provided. The interpretation of observations on effectiveness, safety and tolerability reported in those 
2 patients is limited by the small sample size. It appears that the observations did not differ 
substantially from the overall established safety profile of LCM. No new safety concerns were identified 
in these paediatric patients. 
No changes to the approved EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT are being proposed by 
the MAH following the completion of EP0126. This is endorsed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The reported observations in 2 paediatric patients have not identified any new safety concerns and are 
of limited value. Based on these observations no changes in the SmPC of the product were proposed 
by the MAH what is endorsed. The benefit risk ratio remains unchanged. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

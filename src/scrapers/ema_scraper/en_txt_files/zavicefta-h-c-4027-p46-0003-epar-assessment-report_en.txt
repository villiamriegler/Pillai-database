1.  Introduction 
ZAVICEFTA® (CAZ-AVI ceftazidime/avibactam) is approved  for  use in Europe  for the treatment  of adults 
with  cIAI,  cUTI  including  pyelonephritis,  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  (HAP)  including  ventilator- 
associated  pneumonia  (VAP),  and  infections  due  to  aerobic  Gram-negative  organisms  in  patients  with 
limited  treatment  options.  As  part  of  the  agreed  PIP,  the  applicant  has  conducted  a  single-blind, 
randomised,  multi-centre,  active  controlled,  study  to  evaluate  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK) 
and  efficacy  of  ceftazidime  and  avibactam  compared  with  cefepime  in  children  from  3  months  to  <18 
years of age with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). 
In  this submission, the  MAH  presents a summary  of  the  final  data for paediatric Study  C3591005  in  line 
with the requirements of Article 46 Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006. The results from this study have not 
raised any additional safety concerns. The available information is proposed to be added to the SmPC. 
CAZ-AVI is currently available as an intravenous formulation supplied in a single vial (powder concentrate 
for solution for infusion 2000 mg/500 mg). The pharmaceutical formulation of CAZ-AVI used in this study 
was  identical  to  that  currently  approved.  No  new  biopharmaceutical  data  were  generated  during  this 
application and no additional formulation development studies are currently planned. 
The benefit-risk balance of Zavicefta remains positive. 
2.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.1.  Study C3591005 
Study  C3591005  was  initially  sponsored  by  AstraZeneca.  Sponsorship  for  this  study  was  transferred  to 
Pfizer,  Inc,  on  18  Sept  2017.  The  study  was  conducted  by  investigators  contracted  by  and  under  the 
direction  of  the  Sponsor.  Data  management,  data  analysis,  and  biostatistics  were  performed  by  PRA 
Health  Sciences.  The  PRA  Datalabs  system  was  used  for  data  collection  and  query  handling.  The  PRA 
Drug  Safety  Department  was  responsible  for  collection  of  Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  data,  sending 
expedited SAEs safety reports, and timely reporting of SAEs to AstraZeneca. 
Study Initiation and Completion Dates: 24 September 2015 and 15 September 2017. 
Report Date: 01 May 2018 
Phase of Development: Phase 2 
Study sites: 25 centres spread globally 
Study Objectives: 
Primary Objective: 
- 
To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ceftazidime  and  avibactam  (CAZ-AVI)  given  at  the 
selected  dose  regimen versus cefepime  in paediatric patients aged  >3  months to <18  years with 
complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).

- 
- 
To  evaluate  the  descriptive  efficacy  of  CAZ-AVI  versus  cefepime  in  paediatric  patients  aged  >3 
months to <18 years with cUTI. 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients aged >3 months to <18 
years with cUTI. 
Study Design 
This  was  a  single-blind,  randomised,  multi-centre,  and  actively  controlled  trial  conducted  in  hospitalised 
paediatric  patients  diagnosed  with  cUTIs  requiring  treatment  with  intravenous  (IV)  antibiotics.  Patients 
aged  from  3  months  to  <18  years  with  cUTI  were  randomised  in  a  3:1  ratio  to  receive  CAZ-AVI  or 
cefepime.  Patients  aged  from  3  months  to  <1  year  were  to  have  been  born  at  term  (defined  as 
gestational  age  >37  weeks).  Patients  were  allocated  to  1  of  4  cohorts  based  on  age  (Cohort  1:  patients 
aged from 12 years to <18 years; Cohort 2: patients aged from 6 years to <12 years; Cohort 3: patients 
aged from 2 years to <6 years; Cohort 4: patients aged from 3 months to <2 years). Patients received IV 
treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie, 9 doses if given 3 times daily, or 6 doses if given 
twice daily) before having the option to switch to an oral therapy on Day 4. The decision to switch to oral 
therapy was entirely at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient had good or sufficient clinical response, 
and  the  patient  was  tolerating  oral  fluids  or  food.  The  total  period  of  treatment  (ie,  IV  drug  and  oral 
switch treatment) was to be between 7 and 14 days. Patients could have remained on IV study treatment 
up to Day 14. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
Patients  were  to  have  been  ≥  3  calendar  months  to  <18  years  of  age  (patients  aged  ≥  3  calendar 
months  to  <1  year  must  have  been  born  at  term  [defined  as  gestational  age  ≥  37  weeks])  with  a 
clinically  suspected  and/or  bacteriologically  documented  cUTI  or  acute  pyelonephritis  judged  by  the 
Investigator to 
be  serious  and  required  the  patient  to  be  hospitalised  for  treatment  with  IV  therapy.  For  females  of 
childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test was required at Screening. 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The  dosing  regimens  for  CAZ-AVI  in  this  study  were  selected  based  on  safety  and  PK  data  in  paediatric 
patients  from  Study  D4280C00014,  and  predicted  exposures  from  population  PK  models  for  ceftazidime 
and avibactam. Population PK models previously developed using data from Phase 1, 2, and 3  studies in 
adults  (healthy  subjects  and  patients  with  cIAI  and  cUTI)  were  updated  with  paediatric  PK  data  from 
study D4280C00014. The updated models were then used to simulate a range of dose regimens to assess 
steady-state  exposure  measures  (maximum  plasma  drug  concentration  [Cmax],  area  under  the  plasma 
concentration  versus  time  curve  [AUC],  percent  of  time  that  free  drug  concentrations  are  above  the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) over a dose interval [%fT >MIC] for ceftazidime, and percent of 
time that free drug concentrations are above the threshold concentration over a dose interval [%fT >CT] 
for  avibactam)  in  paediatric  patients  relative  to  adults.  The  selected  paediatric  dose  regimens  are 
predicted to give  >90%  probability of PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) target  attainment  for the same  PK/PD 
target as for adults (50% fT>MIC of 8 mg/L for ceftazidime, and 50% fT>CT of 1.0 mg/L for avibactam). 
Furthermore,  for  each  of  the  paediatric  dose  regimens,  average  ceftazidime  and  avibactam  exposures 
(Cmax and AUC) were predicted to be broadly comparable with reference values in adults who receive the 
approved  CAZ-AVI  dose  regimen  (2000  mg  ceftazidime  plus  500  mg  avibactam,  every  8  hours,  120 
minutes  intravenous  (IV)  infusion),  which  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  in 
adult patients with cIAI. 
The CAZ-AVI dose regimens for the 4 cohorts were:

Study Treatment 
Patients received IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie, 9 doses if given 3 times daily, 
or 6 doses if given twice daily). Doses were based on the age and weight of the patient with adjustment 
for renal function. Beginning on Day 4, there was an option to switch to oral therapy at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Patients could also continue to take IV CAZ-AVI or cefepime from Day 4 up to Day 14. 
Efficacy Evaluations 
Efficacy evaluations were secondary objectives of the study with an objective to evaluate  the  descriptive 
efficacy  of  CAZ-AVI  plus  metronidazole  versus  meropenem.  The  (secondary)  efficacy  outcome  measures 
were: 
-  Clinical  response  at  End  of  72  hours’  treatment,  End  of  Intravenous  Treatment  (EOIV),  End  of 
Treatment (EOT), and Test of Cure (TOC) 
-  Microbiological response at EOIV, EOT, TOC, and Late Follow-up (LFU) 
-  Clinical relapse at LFU 
- 
Emergent infections 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
PK blood samples were collected anytime on Day 3 within 15 minutes prior to or after stopping CAZ AVI 
infusion,  anytime  between  30  minutes  and  90  minutes  after  stopping  CAZ-AVI  infusion,  and  anytime 
between  300  minutes  (5  hours)  and  360  minutes  (6  hours)  after  stopping  CAZ  AVI  infusion.  Plasma 
samples  were  analysed  for  CAZ-AVI  concentrations  using  a  validated,  sensitive  and  specific  method 
involving protein precipitation followed by specific high-performance liquid  chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometric (HPLC/MS/MS) detection. 
Safety Evaluations 
Safety  evaluations  included  adverse  events  (AEs),  vital  signs,  12-lead  electrocardiograms    (ECGs), 
physical examination, and laboratory safety tests.

Statistical Methods: 
Efficacy 
The efficacy analysis of data in this study was based on 4 analysis sets of patients (intent-to-treat [ITT], 
microbiological  ITT  [micro-ITT],  clinically  evaluable  [CE],  and  microbiologically  evaluable  [ME]  analysis 
sets).  Descriptive  statistics  (number,  mean,  standard  deviation  [SD],  median,  minimum,  and  maximum) 
were  provided  for  continuous  variables,  and  counts  and  percentages  with  accompanying  two  sided  95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) (computed using Jeffrey’s method) were presented for categorical variables. 
The  study  was  not  powered  for  inferential  testing  and  based  on  the  3:1  randomisation,  direct 
comparisons of safety and efficacy data between treatment groups must be interpreted with caution. 
Pharmacokinetics 
CAZ-AVI plasma concentrations were summarised by descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, minimum, 
median, maximum, geometric mean, and coefficient of variation). 
Safety 
No  inferential  statistical  tests  were  performed  for  any  safety  parameters.  All  data  were  presented  by 
treatment  group,  cohort,  and  overall  for  each  treatment.  Descriptive  statistics  (number,  mean,  SD, 
median,  minimum,  and  maximum)  were  provided  for  continuous  variables,  and  counts  and  percentages 
were  presented  for  categorical  variables.  Safety  analyses  were  conducted  with  the  safety  analysis  set, 
with confirmatory analyses being performed with the safety evaluable analysis set.

RESULTS 
The median age was 4.22 years (range: 0.3 to 17.7 years) in the CAZ-AVI group and 3.20 years (range: 
0.3 to 17.9 years) in the cefepime group. For cohort 4, the median age was 11.4 months (range: 3.5 to 
22.4 months) in the CAZ-AVI group and 9.5 months (range: 3.1 to 22.5 months) in the cefepime group. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  study  were  female in  both  groups  (56/67  [83.6%]  in  the  CAZ-AVI  group 
and  21/28  [75.0%]  in  the  cefepime  group).  Most  (72  [75.8%])  of  the  patients  were  White.    The 
distribution  of  racial  origin  reflects  the  countries  that  participated  in  the  study.  Seventeen  (17  [17.9%]) 
patients were Asian, 1 (1.1%) patient was American Indian or Alaska Native, and 5 (5.3%) patients were 
classified of being of “Other” race. 
Efficacy Results 
Clinical Response 
In general, across all analysis sets, favourable clinical response rates of >86% were observed at the End 
of 72 hour visit and were sustained through to the EOT visit, with responses remaining >80% at LFU for 
both treatment groups for the ITT, micro-ITT, and CE at LFU analysis sets. The clinical response rates in 
the individual cohorts were consistent with those observed in the overall study population; there were no 
notable trends observed within the cohorts in terms of clinical response in any of the analysis sets. 
Clinical Relapse at LFU 
A total of 4 (5.9%) patients were reported to have clinical relapse in the CAZ-AVI group in the ITT and 4 
(7.4%) patients in the micro-ITT analysis sets. This number was 3 patients (6.8%) in the CE analysis set 
and  2  (12.5%)  patients  in  the  ME  analysis  set.  No  patients  had  clinical  relapse  at  LFU  in  the  cefepime 
group in any of the four efficacy analysis sets.

Clinical Response by Pyelonephritis Diagnosis at Screening 
In  the  ITT  population,  at  TOC,  in  the  pyelonephritis  sub-group,  49/55  patients  (89.1%)  in  the  CAZ-AVI 
group  and  21/25  patients  (84.0%)  in  the  cefepime  group  had  a  favourable  clinical  response.  Similar 
results were observed at each study visit. Overall, this sub-group analysis by pyelonephritis diagnosis was 
consistent with the overall clinical response. 
Clinical Response at Test of Cure by Baseline Pathogen 
In  the  micro-ITT  analysis  set,  favourable  clinical  responses  by  pathogen  at  TOC  for  infections  due  to  E. 
coli was 87.8% for the CAZ-AVI group and 81.8% for the cefepime group). There were 2 patients in the 
CAZ-AVI  group  infected  with  ceftazidime  nonsusceptible  (CAZ-NS)  E.  coli.  One  of  these  patients  had 
favourable  clinical  responses at  all time points and the  other patient  had  favourable clinical  responses at 
all  time  points  except  for  the  EOT  visit,  at  which  the  response  was  indeterminate.  The  1  patient  in  the 
cefepime group that was infected with CAZ-NS E. coli, had an isolate that was also resistant to cefepime 
at baseline and was a clinical failure. 
The results for the ME analysis set were similar to the results for the micro-ITT population; most patients 
had favorable clinical responses by pathogen at TOC for infections due to E. coli (91.9% for the CAZ-AVI 
group and 86.7% for the cefepime group). 
Per-Patient Microbiological Response 
In the micro-ITT analysis set, favourable microbiological response rates of >60.9% were observed at the 
EOIV,  EOT,  and  TOC  visits  for  both  treatment  groups.  Favourable  microbiological  response  rate  were 
lower at the LFU visit for both treatment groups than at the preceding visits (CAZ-AVI: 29.6%; cefepime: 
17.4%).  This  was  primarily  due  to  a  high  percentage  of  indeterminate  responses  (ie,  source  specimen 
was not available to culture) at the LFU visit (CAZ-AVI: n = 32 [59.3%]; cefepime: n = 14 [60.9%]). As 
the LFU visit could have been performed via telephone, a urine culture was not required at this visit and 
therefore  was not  collected  in a large proportion of patients for this reason. For the  ME analysis set, the 
LFU favourable response rate was 62.5% for the CAZ-AVI group and 44.4% for the cefepime group. The 
favourable response rate results for the ME analysis set were different from the micro-ITT analysis set as 
data from patients with indeterminate responses were not included. The lower favourable response at LFU 
could  also  be  partly  attributed  to  the  fact  the  visit  could  have  been  performed  via  telephone  for  any 
patient  who  had  not  experienced  clinical  relapse,  did  not  have  ongoing  AEs  or  SAEs  at  TOC,  or  did  not 
develop  AEs  or  SAEs  since  TOC,  therefore  microbiological  culture  results  at  LFU  were  primarily  obtained 
from  patients  who  may  have  been  more  unwell.  There  was  nothing  notable  observed  across  cohorts  in 
terms of microbiological response. 
Per Pathogen Favourable Microbiological Response Rate at TOC by Pathogen 
Across  both  treatment  groups,  favourable  microbiological  response  rates  for  the  CAZ-AVI  and  cefepime 
groups  for  E.  coli  at  TOC  were:  79.6%  and  59.1%  respectively  in  the  micro-ITT  analysis  set  and  86.5% 
and 66.7%, respectively in the ME analysis set. 
Per  Pathogen  Favourable  Microbiological  Response  Rate  at  TOC  by  Pathogen  Group,  Pathogen  and 
Baseline Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 
Review of per-pathogen responses by MIC did not identify any trends. For the predominant pathogen (E. 
coli), there was no indication that increasing MIC was associated with a lower favourable response rate in 
either treatment group. The results for the ME analysis set mirrored those for the micro-ITT analysis set. 
Persistence 
There  were  5  cases  in  each  treatment  (CAZ-AVI:  5/54  [9.3%]  and  cefepime:  5/23  [21.7%])  group  at 
TOC  of  persistent  Enterobacteriaceae  infections.  At  LFU,  there  were  6/54  (11.1%)  in  the  CAZ-AVI  and

5/23  (21.7%)  in  the  cefepime  group.  All  patients  who  had  a  microbiological  response  of  persistence 
(EOIV, EOT, TOC and/or LFU) in the micro-ITT analysis set had E. coli as a baseline pathogen. 
Persistence with Increasing MIC 
There  were  no  reported  cases  of  pathogens  with  reported  persistence  with  increasing  MIC  in  either 
treatment group. 
Emergent Infections 
A total of 3 patients (7.3%) had emergent infections in the CAZ-AVI group and there were none occurring 
in  the  cefepime  group  as  assessed  by  the  evaluability  and  clinical/microbiological  assessment  (ECMA) 
review  committee.  Of  the  3  new  infections,  2  patients  were  reported  to  have  both  underlying  urological 
abnormalities and complicating factors. 
Combined Response 
A total of 43 (79.6%) patients in the CAZ-AVI group and 18 (78.3%) patients in the cefepime group and 
had a favourable combined response at EOIV. At TOC, 39 (72.2%) patients in the CAZ-AVI group and 14 
(60.9%) patients in the cefepime group had a favourable combined response. Data for the ME population 
were consistent with that for the micro-ITT population. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Median  plasma  concentrations  of  CAZ  and  AVI  were  similar  across  age  cohorts,  although  concentrations 
were lower for trough samples in Cohort 3 and lower for samples taken near the end of infusion in Cohort 
4.  Avibactam  and  ceftazidime  PK  parameters  derived  from  population  PK  analysis  and  potential 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships will be reported separately. 
Safety Results 
Of  the  101  enrolled  patients,  97  were  randomised  and  95  received  treatment  (67  were  treated  in  the 
CAZ-AVI  group  and  28  were  treated  within  in  the  cefepime  group)  and  were  included  in  the  safety 
analysis set. The highest number of patients by age cohort was in Cohort 4 with 38 patients (CAZ-AVI n 
= 27 and cefepime n = 11) randomised. Cohort 1 randomised 19 patients (CAZ-AVI n = 13 and cefepime 
n = 6), Cohort 2 randomised 22 patients (CAZ-AVI n = 17 and cefepime n = 5), and Cohort 3 randomised 
18 patients (CAZ-AVI n = 11 and cefepime n = 7). 
For all cohorts combined, the median (minimum-maximum) duration of exposure to IV study drug was 4 
(1 to 11) days for the CAZ-AVI group and 4 (2 to 11) days for the cefepime group. Greater than 90% of 
patients  in  both  treatment  groups  were  switched  to  oral  therapy  to  complete  their  study  treatment.  The 
median  duration  of  oral  drug  exposure  was  7  days  for  patients  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  majority 
(84/95 [88.4%]) of patients in the study received 8 to 15 days of IV + oral therapy, consistent with the 
protocol recommended treatment duration of 7 to 14 days (IV + oral therapy combined). 
The incidence of AEs in any category for each treatment for the safety analysis set is summarised below:

The  most  frequently  reported  system  organ  class  (SOC)  was  infections  and  infestations.  The  most 
frequently  reported  AEs,  by  preferred  term  (PT),  were  Diarrhoea  and  urinary  tract  infection  in  the  CAZ- 
AVI  group,  each  in  5  patients  (7.5%),  and  Diarrhoea  in  3  patients  (10.7%)  in  the  cefepime  group.  In 
general, reported AEs were mild in intensity and considered not related to study treatment. Three (4.5%) 
patients in the CAZ-AVI group had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  experienced  by  10  patients  (8  [11.9%]  in  CAZ-AVI  group  and  2  [7.1%]  in 
the cefepime group). Of these SAEs, only one was judged to be related to study treatment by the Blinded 
Observer  (severe  Nervous  system  disorder),  which  resolved  and  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of 
study  treatment.  In  terms  of  cephalosporin  class  effects  and  AEs  of  special  interest  (AEoSI),  there  were 
10  (14.9%)  patients  with AEoSI  reported  during  the  study  in  the  CAZ-AVI  group,  which were  within  the 
safety  topics  of  liver  disorders,  diarrhoea,  and  hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis,  none  of  which  were 
considered to be SAEs. Notably, there were no AEoSI reported within the safety topics of haematological 
disorders  and  renal  disorders  and  there  were  no  reported  cases  of  C.  difficile.  There  were  no  deaths 
during the study. In general, there were no trends observed in changes from baseline for the majority of 
clinical  laboratory  tests  with  the  exception  of  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  and  leukocyte  count;  for  both  of 
these analytes, there was a trend for decreasing levels, consistent with recovery from infection. 
For  vital  signs,  temperature  and  heart  rate  decreased  from  elevated  baseline  values  towards  normal 
ranges  throughout  the  study,  consistent  with  recovery  from  infection.  There  were  no  other  trends 
observed  in  changes  from  baseline  for  other  vital  signs,  ECG,  or  physical  examinations  variables.  No 
patients met potential Hy’s Law criteria during the study. 
Conclusion(s): 
CAZ-AVI  was  generally  well  tolerated  and  appeared  effective  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  >3 
months of age to  <18  years of age  with cUTI, including those  with CAZ-NS strains. Overall, the  findings 
from this study extend the previous determination of safety and efficacy for CAZ-AVI for the treatment of 
adult patients with cUTI to the paediatric population and no new safety concerns were identified. 
2.2.  Discussion 
The  applicant  has submitted  a study in the paediatric population; this study was part  of the  agreed  PIP. 
The doses selected in the study were based on previously available data and PK modelling and simulation, 
however these reports were not available with the current submission and will be submitted separately. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  CAZ-AVI  in  paediatric 
patients. The  safety results from this study suggest that  CAZ-AVI was  well tolerated. The  sample  size of 
this  study  was  small  and  therefore  the  safety  and  tolerability  conclusions  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution. 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  present  study,  there  do  not  appear  to  be  any  new  safety  concerns  in  the 
paediatric population. The applicant has proposed to add the available information in the SmPC at a later 
stage.

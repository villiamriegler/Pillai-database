2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ontozry (cenobamate) is indicated as adjunctive treatment of focal onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in adult patients with epilepsy who have not been adequately controlled 
despite a history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic products. 
Focal onset seizures are a group of seizures that may or may not evolve to disturbance or loss of 
consciousness (complex or secondary generalisation). Although the majority of patients are well 
controlled with 1 or 2 ASMs, over 30% of patients need new, alternative treatments as they do not 
gain seizure freedom on existing therapies.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Epilepsy affects about 70 million people worldwide, making it one of the most prevalent serious 
neurological conditions. Each year, 16 to 134 new onset epilepsy cases per 100,000 people are 
diagnosed (Laxer 2014). In Europe, age-adjusted prevalence has been reported to range from 2.7 in 
Italy to 5.5 per 1000 in Denmark and 7.0 per 1000 in European regions of Turkey. Age-adjusted 
incidence of epilepsy in European studies ranged from 26 per 100,000 person-years in Norway to 47 
per 100,000 person-years in England. Epilepsy has been noted to be the most common serious 
neurological disorder in the UK (Banerjee 2009, National Clinical Guideline Centre 2012). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Epilepsy is defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) by any of the following 
conditions: (1) at least 2 unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked 
(or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (≥60%) 
after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome 
(Fisher 2014). Epilepsy has numerous causes, each reflecting underlying, genetic or acquired brain 
dysfunction (Stafstrom 2015). The most recent ILAE classification of epileptic seizures defines focal, 
generalised, or unknown onset seizures, with subcategories of motor or non-motor seizures with 
retained or impaired awareness (Fisher 2017). Focal onset seizures originate in neuronal networks 
limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere and may or may not secondarily generalize across the entire 
cortex. (Stafstrom 2015). Focal onset seizures are the most frequent form of secondary epilepsy in 
adults. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
People with epilepsy have a poorer overall health status, impaired intellectual and physical functioning, 
greater risk for accidents and injuries, and negative side effects from anti-seizure medications. They 
have a high rate of comorbidities, including somatic, behavioural, and psychiatric disorders. In patients 
with epilepsy, the prevalence of suicidal thoughts is 2–3 times higher than in those without epilepsy. 
Suicide appears to also be associated with chronic, drug resistant epilepsy. A recent study not only 
showed that seizure frequency was positively associated with suicidal tendency but also concluded that 
reducing seizure frequency may be the basis of suicide prevention in people with epilepsy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 9/122 
 
 
 
The risk of premature mortality is 3 times higher in people with epilepsy than in the general 
population. Mortality may be due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), fatal status 
epilepticus, an increased risk to die of injuries such as drowning or falls, suicide, or non-psychiatric 
comorbidities including neoplasia and cerebrovascular and respiratory disease. Over 30% of patients 
need new, alternative treatments as they do not gain seizure freedom on existing therapies. Sudden 
unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of mortality among patients with epilepsy, 
particularly those with generalised tonic-clonic seizures. However, the greater risk of death over the 
general population may be reduced by achieving seizure freedom through establishing effective 
treatment strategies. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Control of epilepsy primarily focuses on suppressing seizure activity because the underlying condition 
is not curatively treatable. Patient prognosis is generally linked to the probability to achieve seizure 
freedom.  
Antiepileptic Drugs (ASMs) are the mainstay of epilepsy treatment. However, adverse effects of ASMs 
are a major source of disability, morbidity, and mortality and are a substantial burden on use and costs 
of health care. It is estimated that adverse effects result in early treatment discontinuation in up to 
25% of patients. Cutaneous manifestations of hypersensitivity are the most common idiosyncratic 
reactions to ASMs and range from mild urticarioid/maculopapular eruptions to the more severe drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). 
Despite side effect burden, the majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis for full seizure 
control. Approximately 63% of people with epilepsy will achieve longer-term seizure freedom, and 
most achieve that after the first or second ASM treatment. However, over 30 % of epilepsy cases, 
particularly those with focal seizures, need new, alternative treatments as they do not gain seizure 
freedom on existing therapies. When a first drug fails, further ASMs will be initiated. Polytherapy is 
usually offered after failure of 2 or 3 sequential monotherapies but may be considered earlier when 
prognostic factors indicate a difficult-to-treat form of epilepsy unlikely to respond fully to monotherapy.  
Chen et al described that the probability of achieving seizure freedom diminishes substantially with 
each additional attempt at an ASM regimen. The study demonstrated that the initial ASM leads to 
45.7% of patients achieving seizure freedom. If the initial ASM is ineffective, the second ASM results in 
an 11.6% chance of seizure freedom. Once a patient has failed a second ASM only 4.4% will achieve 
seizure freedom if a third regimen is required. For patients who failed 3 ASMs, only 2.1% of patients 
will achieved seizure control on multiple subsequent ASM regimens irrespective of the specific 
medications chosen.  
Drug-resistant epilepsy 
According to ILAE, drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as a failure of adequate trials of 2 tolerated and 
appropriately chosen and used ASM schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to 
achieve sustained seizure freedom, which could be either 3 times the prior inter-seizure interval or 1 
year, whichever is longer. Using the ILAE criteria, up to 44.5% of patients may be considered drug-
resistant. 
Patients who are refractory to drug-resistant account for most of the burden of epilepsy in the 
population. They experience comorbid illnesses, are at an increased risk of injury, premature death, 
psychological dysfunction and experience an overall reduced quality of life (Laxer 2014; Chen 2018; 
Hogan 2018). Of the patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, many experience prolonged seizures or

Page 10/122 
 
 
 
status epilepticus and, as a result, suffer bodily injuries requiring hospitalisation. Other patients have 
shortened life spans because of the increased risk of sudden unexpected death that is associated with 
uncontrolled seizures. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy have significant neuropsychological, 
psychiatric, and social impairments that limit employment, reduce marriage rates, and decrease quality 
of life. Drug-resistant epilepsy may be progressive, carrying risks of structural damage to the brain and 
nervous system, comorbidities, and increased mortality, as well as psychological, educational, social, 
and vocational consequences. Adding to this burden is neuropsychiatric impairment caused by 
underlying epileptogenic processes, which seems to be independent of the effects of ongoing seizures 
themselves. Management of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy is particularly challenging because it 
is not fully understood how or why drug resistance develops in a particular patient.  
Despite the availability of new ASMs with different mechanisms of action, overall outcomes in epilepsy 
have not improved over the last decades. While ASMs approved in the last decade demonstrate 
favourable PK and safety profiles; improved efficacy over first-generation ASMs has not been 
demonstrated in clinical studies. Zhu et al noted that although there was a large number of new ASMs 
on the market, the proportion of drug resistant patients did not change significantly. Beyenburg et al 
reported a study in which the overall weighted-pooled-risk difference in favour of ASMs over placebo 
for seizure-freedom in adults and children was only 6% which the authors noted was “disappointingly 
small”. In that same analysis paper, 21% of subjects attained a 50% or greater reduction weighted-
pooled-risk difference in seizure frequency in favour of ASMs over placebo. Few patients who have 
been assessed in adjunctive trials of ASMs developed in the past two decades become seizure free, and 
approximately 20% to 40% of patients show a 50% or greater reduction in the frequency of their 
seizures compared to 2% to 25% on placebo. 
Existing treatments are not satisfactory and alternative methods are needed for those patients with 
epilepsy suffering from uncontrolled seizures. Because there is increasing evidence that seizure 
freedom will substantially reduce the burden of disease, and even mortality, in patients with epilepsy, 
patients who continue to have seizures should receive optimum treatment to give them the best 
chance of seizure freedom. 
About the product 
Cenobamate  is  a  small  molecule  being  developed  as  an  ASM  for  adjunctive  treatment  of  focal-onset 
seizures  in  patients  with  treatment-resistant  epilepsy.  It  is  a  positive  allosteric  modulator  of  the  γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ion channel, via a binding site different from benzodiazepines. Cenobamate 
has  also  been  shown  to  reduce  repetitive  neuronal  firing  by  enhancing  the  inactivation  of  sodium 
channels and by inhibiting the persistent component of the sodium current. The mechanism of action by 
which cenobamate exercises its therapeutic effects remains to be fully elucidated.

(E172) (except for 50 mg), iron oxide yellow (E172), polyethylene glycol 3350, partially hydrolysed 
poly(vinyl alcohol) (E1203), talc (E553b) and titanium dioxide (E171).  
The product is available in in a PVC blister covered with aluminium foil as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cenobamate is [(1R)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(tetrazol-2-yl)ethyl] carbamate 
corresponding to the molecular formula C10H10ClN5O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 267.67 and 
the following structure:  
Figure 1 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Cenobamate is a white to off-white crystalline powder which is non-hygroscopic and slightly soluble in 
distilled water.  
Cenobamate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Cenobamate is 
synthesised as the R-enantiomer.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. A single polymorphic form of cenobamate is 
consistently produced by the manufacturing process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in six main steps from well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
During development, scientific advice was sought from two EU National Competent Authorities and 
both agencies agreed in the recommendation that, while the proposed starting material may be 
acceptable provided that specifications are tightened, the starting material should be re-defined due to 
the short synthetic route from the proposed starting material to the active substance and due to the 
fact that impurities from the proposed starting material impact on the impurity profile of the active 
substance. 
In the MA application, the starting material was designated as initially proposed, together with 
tightened specification limits of impurities in the active substance. However, the CHMP did not agree 
with the proposed starting material as the designation was not considered fully in line with ICH Q11 
and a major objection was raised. The applicant accepted to re-define the starting materials, which 
resolved the major objection.  
Reprocessing steps are identified and sufficiently justified. Recovered or recycled solvents are not used 
in the process.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Benzene (class 1 as per ICH Q3C) is a potential contaminant in two solvents used in the manufacture 
of the active substance and an adequate control strategy has been presented for both solvents. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
During the initial assessment, the CHMP raised a major objection related to the characterisation of the 
active substance and the control of one nitrosamine impurity that was satisfactorily addressed by the 
applicant. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The critical quality attributes (CQA) and the critical process steps of the cenobamate synthesis were 
determined by a QbD-based risk assessment, previous knowledge, and statistical experiments. 
The risk assessment is supported by knowledge of the origin and fate of the impurities. 
A systematic technical review of the process parameters in the synthesis of cenobamate was 
performed and their proven acceptable ranges (PAR) and normal operating ranges (NOR) were 
determined.  
The manufacturing process has been consistently reproduced with high robustness during a process 
validation campaign. 
The proposed acceptance limits for critical process parameters (CPP) were satisfactorily justified. 
Proposed holding times for intermediates are supported by stability data. 
Changes introduced in the manufacturing process and the control strategy have been presented in 
sufficient detail and have been justified. A satisfactory summary of data and results with reference to 
active substance used in preclinical and clinical studies was presented. 
The active substance is packaged in bags which comply with EC directive 2002/72/EC and Commission 
Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 as amended.

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (FT-IR acc. Ph. Eur., HPLC), 
chiral purity (HPLC), chemical purity (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Identification by IR, residue on ignition, residual solvents by GC, and particle size distribution is only 
tested for release of the active substance. 
Proposed tests and acceptance criteria have been established based on guidelines and batch analysis 
data. ‘In-house’ specifications comply with Ph. Eur. requirements for substances for pharmaceutical 
use, and with ICH Q6A guidance. The proposed limits of acceptance for impurities are justified by 
batch analysis results and by impurity genesis and fate experimental studies. The proposed acceptance 
limits comply generally with requirements of current ICH guidelines Q3A, Q3C, Q3D and ICH M7. The 
limits proposed are supported by batch analysis and stability data and are considered acceptable. 
The absence of microbiological control of the active substance was satisfactorily justified and is 
acceptable.

Page 13/122 
 
 
 
Since no significant changes have been observed in particle size distribution, a particle size test is not 
required in stability testing. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
A genotoxic impurity assessment has been performed, taking into account all starting materials, 
intermediates, reagents and reaction conditions as well as potential impurities and degradation 
products. Two potential impurities, both derivatives of starting material, were classified as potentially 
genotoxic (class 3). Two other structurally related impurities were also evaluated but classified as class 
5. A detailed explanation of the origin, fate, purge and control of these potentially genotoxic impurities 
has been provided. The proposed acceptance criteria for these impurities have been adequately 
justified.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  
A risk of the presence of one specific nitrosamine in cenobamate was identified based on solvents and 
reagents used in the route of synthesis. Updated confirmatory testing using a validated method was 
provided. Analytical results demonstrated that the nitrosamine is not detected. Since nitrosamines are 
below the 30% ICH M7 threshold for both the interim (0.24 ppm) and future limits (0.03 ppm), routine 
testing for the nitrosamine is not considered necessary. However, the CHMP asked for a commitment 
to repeat/update the confirmatory tests in batches with the redefined starting materials from the newly 
qualified vendors. This commitment was accepted the applicant. 
Stress testing studies revealed the major degradation product of the active substance observed under 
all the stressed conditions. Other unknown degradation products were also observed. The stress 
studies performed demonstrated that the method is specific and stability indicating.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from several registration/stability batches and several validation batches (commercial 
scale) of active substance from the proposed manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial 
packaging or in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 36-
60 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6-12 months under accelerated 
conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: description, identification by HPLC, assay by HPLC, chiral purity by chiral HPLC, chemical 
purity by HPLC, related substances by HPLC, and water content by Karl Fischer. All tested parameters 
were within the specification. 
The analytical methods have been shown to be stability-indicating through the performance of forced 
degradation studies. Results from these studies under stress conditions show a considerable 
Assessment report

degradation under extreme basic and heat conditions, and a moderate degradation under extreme 
oxidation and acid conditions. 
No significant changes or trends were observed in any parameter at long-term (25°C), intermediate 
(30°C) and accelerated (40°C) storage conditions. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed and showed that the active substance 
is not photosensitive. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months. Any confirmed out-of-specification 
result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the assessors and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release tablets, for oral administration, of six 
strengths: uncoated tablets (12.5 mg) and film-coated tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 
200 mg). 
The six strengths of cenobamate tablets may be differentiated by colour, size, debossing and shape 
(for 200 mg strength). 
The composition complies with the state-of-the-art for an oral solid dosage form. The function of each 
excipient is explained.  
The pharmaceutically and clinically relevant physicochemical properties of the active substance were 
duly identified, adequately specified and controlled. The chosen formulation adequately accommodates 
the physicochemical properties of the active substance (stability, incompatibilities, solubility, route of 
administration). 
Throughout the re-test period the chiral purity of the active substance remained constant at 100%. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except for the film-coat material Opadry II, for which the used quantities are well justified, 
and an in-house standard is used. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility studies of active substance and several compendial excipients were performed. 
Cenobamate is compatible with all excipients tested. 
The formulation development is supported by clinical development and details on the changes in 
formulation were presented.  
Eventually, six tablet formulations have been developed: 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg 
and 200 mg.  
The proposed formulation is for adult and elderly patients. Because of the multiple strengths, break 
marks on the cenobamate tablets were not included. The statement which previously suggested that 
the tablets cannot be chewed or crushed has been deleted from the SmPC. The proposed dosing 
regimen is one (1) tablet per day until the recommended target dose of 200 mg is achieved.  
Based on the critical assessment of QTPPs, the finished product specifications were established to 
ensure consistent quality, potency and purity of the finished product. 
Pharmaceutical development studies involved the development of clinical trial material, registration 
tablet formulations and comprehensive scale-up studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021

The development of the dissolution test is described, and the discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method has been demonstrated. The method allows distinguishing changes in active substance particle 
size and hardness.  
The physicochemical characteristic of active substance (particle size), the appropriate excipient grade, 
the composition of common blend and blend physical characteristic, compression profiling of tablets 
with different target hardness, scale up (the equipment including type of blender, coating pan, process 
parameters), uniform of blend flow, absence of segregation during compression were verified during 
development stage. Process parameter ranges are satisfactorily investigated and supported by 
pharmaceutical development. 
The tablet manufacturing process development is described. Differences in the manufacturing 
processes of the commercial product and clinical trial material are adequately explained and discussed. 
Comparative dissolution studies were conducted to bridge the different finished product formulations 
used in the early and late phase clinical studies.  
The process critical parameters were identified. The process parameters used for coating were also 
studied. Coating parameters are determined based on the batch size, tablet load and the tablet size.  
The critical process parameters (CPPs), critical material attributes (CMAs) and in-process controls 
(IPCs) for finished product manufacturing have been identified based on the information gained from 
the CPP experiments described in the section above, the data from initial formulation and process 
development work, clinical trial material, registration to scale-up work and general pharmaceutical 
manufacturing theory. 
The pharmaceutical development has been properly described and includes a Quality by Design 
approach. The applicant presented the Quality Target Product Profile (QTTP). The quality 
characteristics of the product ensure the desired target product profile. 
Risk assessment tools were used in to rank and select material quality attributes and /or process 
parameters that should be within appropriate ranges to ensure the desired product quality. 
The proposed risk ranking is acceptable, and the identified risks are managed by the proposed control 
strategy. 
The choice of materials for the container and closure is adequate to support the stability and use of the 
product with adults. The choice of materials for the container and closure, in particular considering 
their use by elderly patients, has been adequately justified. 
The microbiological attributes of the finished product are those of a non-sterile solid oral dosage form 
complying with Ph. Eur. 5.1.4. 
The primary packaging is a PCV blister covered with aluminium foil. The material complies with Ph.Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The 12.5 mg tablet is not coated. The 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg tablets are coated 
with a non-functional cosmetic film coat. 
Process parameters and IPC were identified during development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 16/122 
 
 
 
The acceptable process ranges were established in systematic way using QbD principles. 
The proposed process validation protocols are adequate. The applicant confirms that the manufacturing 
process will be validated before any product is made commercially available, which is considered 
sufficient for this type of product and manufacturing process. 
The applicant commits to conducting shipping validation under protocol. 
Any post approval changes in the manufacturing process, which are beyond the approved process 
parameters, will be submitted and managed in compliance with the published variation guidelines.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC and UV diode array), potency assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), Uniformity of Dosage Unit (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. 
Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
In line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP 
Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). A major objection was initially raised by the CHMP in relation to the nitrosamine 
risk assessment, but this was addressed by the applicant in a satisfactory way. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis details and data obtained with 3 batches of 12.5 mg tablets, 3 batches of 25 mg tablets, 
2 batches of 50 mg tablets, 1 batch of 100 mg tablets, 2 batches of 150 mg tablets and 3 batches of 
200 mg tablets. Batch sizes are also reported. The results confirm the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. The testing will be conducted on the bulk tablets and no 
additional finished product release testing will be conducted after packaging. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from registration batches of finished product, stored for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months for all batches under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been 
observed. 
Stability studies at intermediate conditions were also conducted (30°C / 65% RH). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 17/122 
 
 
 
A photostability study was conducted according with the ICH Q1B Option 2 and the data obtained 
demonstrate that cenobamate tablets are not photosensitive. 
The proposed bulk hold time for tablets is acceptable. 
The post-approval stability protocol is acceptable.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months (4 years) for the 12.5 mg 
tablets, and for the 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets and 36 months (3 years) for the 150 
mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets without any special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
(section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is the only excipient of animal origin. All other excipients used are not of human 
and/or animal origin. Certification from suppliers are provided indicating that no bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE) /transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) components are used in the 
manufacturing or processing of the specified excipients. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The CHMP initially raised two major objections in relation to the active substance and one major 
objection in relation to the finished product. The first major objection concerned the request for re-
designation of the starting material. This was accepted and addressed by the applicant. The second 
major objection concerned the nitrosamine risk assessment and additional work needed in relation to 
one nitrosamine impurity. The major objection was addressed in a satisfactory way by the applicant. 
The third major objection also concerned the nitrosamine risk assessment and that the assessment 
should be extended to the container closure system and any potential external source that can 
contaminate the final drug product with nitrosamines. An acceptable risk assessment was provided by 
the applicant. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points are put forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided an adequate non-clinical package with studies covering primary and secondary 
pharmacodynamics, and safety pharmacology.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Effect on GABAA channels 
In vitro and ex vivo studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of cenobamate on GABAergic 
neurotransmission. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that cenobamate acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors 
and  positively  modulates  the  GABA-induced  current  of  6  GABAA  receptor  subtypes  (α1β2γ2,  α2β3γ2, 
α3β3γ2, α4β3γ2, α5β3γ2, α6β3γ2) with EC50 values ranging from 42 μM to 194 μM (equivalent to 11.2 
to  51.9  μg/mL).  Cenobamate  has  however  limited  agonist  activity  at  these  GABAA receptor  subtypes 
(agonist EC50 > 1000 μM).   
In  rat  hippocampal  slices,  cenobamate  (300  –1,000  µM)  potentiated  Itonic  and  IPSC  prolongation  in 
dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs).  Additionally, in CA1 neurons, cenobamate at 30 –1,000 µM induced 
a significant Itonic in a concentration-dependent manner. Despite enhancing Itonic, low concentrations (30 
and 100 µM) of cenobamate did not affect the amplitude and decay time of IPSCs, suggesting that while 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 19/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cenobamate  potentiates  both  synaptic  (phasic)  and  extrasynaptic  (tonic)  GABAA  receptors,  it 
preferentially modulates extra-synaptic GABAARs over their synaptic counterparts in CA1 neurons. 
This assertion is strengthened by the fact that cenobamate effects were unaltered by antagonists of the 
benzodiazepine  (BZD)  receptor  site,  a  binding  site  expressed  by  synaptic  GABAARs.    At  a  clinically 
relevant concentration (
30 μM), cenobamate increased GABA-induced currents in rat hippocampal CA3 
neurons, and this effect was not affected by 1 μM of the BZD antagonist flumazenil, confirming other 
electrophysiological  and  binding  data  that  cenobamate  does  not  exert  its  GABA  potentiating  effects 
∼
through interaction with the BZD binding site. 
Lack  of  tolerance  to  cenobamate  anticonvulsant  effects  was  demonstrated  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.    In 
neurons taken from rats pretreated with cenobamate at 15 mg/kg BID for 7 days, pretreatment did not 
affect GABAA current potentiation by cenobamate.  
Effect on sodium channels 
In vitro electrophysiology assays have been conducted to investigate the effects of cenobamate on Na+ 
channels. 
In  adult  rat  dorsal  root  ganglion  (DRG)  neurons,  cenobamate  decreased  the  peak  amplitude  of 
tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium currents in a concentration-
dependent manner, suggesting that cenobamate could act on a variety of Na+ channels.  
This was subsequently confirmed by screening studies on human isoforms of Na+ channels Nav1.1 to 
Nav1.8/β3 expressed in mammalian cells that showed inactivated state-dependent block by cenobamate 
(inactivated state IC50 values of the different channels ranging from 23.3 – 146 µM). 
Furthermore, cenobamate potently inhibits the persistent, non-inactivating, component of INa without a 
significant effect on the inward transient current as demonstrated in studies in rodent hippocampal CA3 
pyramidal neurons.  In cultures of CA3 neurons from mice intraperitoneally-injected with pilocarpine (a 
model of epileptic mouse), cenobamate maintained an equally potent inhibition of voltage ramp-induced 
persistent  Na+  current  in  both  saline  and  pilocarpine-treated  mice,  in  contrast  to  carbamazepine  and 
lacosamide that showed a reduced potency in neurons from pilocarpine-treated mice. 
Cenobamate showed no significant direct interaction with receptors or voltage- or ligand-gated channels 
(sodium, calcium and potassium ion channels, GABA receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors 
and other receptors (adenosine A2A and A3, somatostatin sst1 and sst5, corticotropin-releasing factor 
[CRF1], cannabinoid CB1 and CB2, β1 adrenergic, opiate μ, tyrosine receptor kinase [Trk] A and TrkB 
receptors). Consequently, no single specific receptor or ion channel has been identified as being the sole 
contributor to the mechanism of action of cenobamate.  
Anticonvulsant efficacy in rodent seizure models 
Cenobamate was tested in a battery of well-characterised in vivo rodent seizure models: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 20/122 
 
 
 
Electrically induced seizures 
MES  
6 Hz 
•  MES (maximal electroshock) is a model of generalised seizures.   
•  ED50s between 0.27 and 1.88 mg/kg PO in rats and between 7.04 and 9.84 
mg/kg IP in mice. 
•  There was no pharmacodynamic tolerance to the cenobamate anticonvulsant 
effect after 5 days of dosing. 
•  The 6 Hz assay is a model of therapy resistant focal seizures.   
•  Cenobamate was equipotent at three stimulus intensities (22, 32, 44 mA) at 
non-toxic doses (mean ED50s between 11 and 17.9 mg/kg IP), suggesting a 
novel mechanism of action as compared to existing ASMs.  While many ASMs 
with different mechanisms of action are active against 22 mA induced 
seizures, only valproate shows equipotent efficacy at all 3 stimulus intensities. 
Hippocampal 
kindling 
•  Hippocampal kindling is a model of focal onset seizures.   
•  Cenobamate significantly inhibited seizure scores, with a mean ED50 of 16.4 
mg/kg IP. 
Chemically induced seizures 
PTZ 
•  Cenobamate inhibited clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous PTZ 
(pentylenetetrazol) in mice and rats, with ED50s ranging from 3.8 to 28.5 
mg/kg in multiple studies.  
•  Cenobamate is not expected to produce any notable adverse effects on seizure 
threshold as doses up to 58 mg/kg IP protected against IV PTZ-induced 
seizure activity.  
Pilocarpine 
•  Model of intractable seizures. 
•  Cenobamate produced dose-dependent inhibition of seizures with an ED50 
dose of 7 mg/kg. 
Picrotoxin and 
Bicuculine 
•  Seizures are induced by these GABAA receptor antagonists. 
•  ED50s range from 23 to >70 mg/kg IP. 
Genetically determined seizures 
GAERS 
•  GAERS (genetic absence epilepsy rat of Strasbourg) is a model of absence 
seizures. 
•  Cenobamate induced a dose dependent reduction in spike wave discharges 
characteristic of absence seizures, with a near maximal effect at 30 mg/kg. 
•  The effect of cenobamate appeared more prolonged than that of the reference 
compound valproate. 
Cenobamate, administered IP and/or PO, produced antiepileptic effects in mice and rats at doses between 
0.3 and 30 mg/kg.  
A  summary  of  the  cenobamate  effects  in  different  seizure  models  in  mice  in  comparison  to  other 
commercially available anticonvulsive drugs is presented in the following Table 2.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Electrophysiological  and  radioligand  binding  studies  of  an  extensive  panel  of  ion  channels,  receptors, 
enzymes and transporters showed that cenobamate had no significant binding. IC50 values (for inhibition 
of radioligand binding) of 300 µM (equivalent to 80.4 µg/mL) and above for β1 adrenergic receptor, Cl- 
channel (GABA-gated), dopamine transporter, κ (KOP) and OX1 receptors were observed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A battery of safety pharmacology studies was conducted with cenobamate.  The main studies and 
conclusions are summarised hereafter:  
CNS 
CNS effects of cenobamate have been linked to autonomic, behavioural and 
motor function.  The CNS effects are dose-dependent and appear to be related 
to the Cmax. The effects include ataxia, decreased activity and motor tone, and 
hypothermia.  
Median doses in mice and rats in tests of motor performance were much greater 
than those required to elicit antiepileptic effects in rodents. 
No evidence of epileptic seizures in an EEG study in non-human primates. 
Cardiovascular 
No evidence of cardiovascular effects was observed by telemetric 
electrocardiography in male non-human primates.   
In vitro hERG and Purkinje fiber studies indicated no prolongation of the QTc 
interval  
The Purkinje fiber study showed a small degree of action potential shortening at 
higher than clinically expected exposures of the drug (53% decrease in APD50 at 
100 µM). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021

Respiratory 
No adverse respiratory effects in the rat GLP respiratory study, except for 
decreased minute volume (20% of the maximum effect) at the highest dose of 
60 mg/kg. 
Other 
Cenobamate, at 30 mg/kg, caused a moderate delay in gastrointestinal transit 
in the rat. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with cenobamate.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  PK/TK  profile  of  cenobamate  was  evaluated  across  wide  dose  ranges  in  single  and  repeat  dose 
studies  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and  monkeys  following  oral  (PO),  intravenous  (IV),  subcutaneous 
(SC)  or  intraperitoneal  (IP)  administration.  Drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  potential  of  cenobamate  was 
assessed in vitro for the most relevant cytochrome P450s, UGT enzymes and transporters. 
In summary, the non-clinical ADME studies established the following: 
Absorption 
Cenobamate is considered highly soluble in water and highly permeable with high 
oral bioavailability and low clearance in mice, rats and monkeys.   
Primary toxicokinetic studies were conducted in rats and monkey. 
In rats, cenobamate exposures were generally higher in female rats than in male 
rats. 
•  Exposures in males appeared dose proportional, exposures in female were 
less than dose-proportional. 
•  For both genders, exposures were lower after repeated dosing compared to 
single dosing, indicating a potential increase in metabolism (e.g., auto-
induction) after repeat dosing. 
In monkeys cenobamate exposures generally increased dose-proportionally in 
both males and females. 
•  Exposures were generally similar or slightly higher for female monkeys. 
•  After repeated dosing there was generally no to slight accumulation of drug 
for both genders.  
Protein binding data show moderate protein binding of cenobamate in animal and 
human plasma (43.2%, 54.9%, 35.4%, 65.0%, 60.7% to 70.7%, and 61.0% for 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human, respectively). 
Evaluation of tissue distribution of [14C]-cenobamate in rat show mean tissue-to-
plasma ratios near 1.0 (including brain), indicating equal tissue distribution 
throughout the body, with the exception of higher tissue concentrations in kidney 
(4.7) and liver (2.7). 
The volume of distribution in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys was similar or 
slightly lower than the total body water volume, indicating that cenobamate is 
well distributed throughout the body. 
Distribution 
Metabolism 
Mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey showed qualitative similarities in metabolism to 
the human profile.  
•  Metabolism was slow in dog, rat, monkey and human liver microsomes with 
dog as the fastest. 
•  In all species, cenobamate was extensively metabolised, as evidenced by 
the presence of low amounts of parent drug in the excreta; ranging from 
6.8% in humans to 18.5% in mice. 
No additional testing of metabolites was conducted as no major circulating 
metabolites were observed in human or nonclinical species.

Excretion 
•  Investigations following single oral dose administration of [14C]-
cenobamate showed parent drug as the major circulating radioactive 
component in all species.  
•  An ex vivo study of human metabolism revealed presence of the parent 
drug (>98%) and a single N-glucuronide metabolite in human plasma, with 
the exposure of the N-glucuronide metabolite only 1.2% of the parent drug.  
Excretion parameters were evaluated following a single oral dose of [14C]-
cenobamate in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys.  
•  Most of the radioactivity (≥94.0% of the dose) was excreted in urine and 
faeces within 168 hours for all nonclinical species.  
•  Mice, rabbits, and monkeys excreted 70.0 to 78.8% of the dose in urine; 
whereas rats excreted 52.6% to 74.4% into urine.  
Nonclinical species generally showed similar extent of urinary excretion of 
cenobamate compared to humans in which 87.8% of the dose was eliminated 
within 312 hours. 
DDI potential 
Nonclinical assessments also included in vitro DDI studies using CYP450 
enzymes, UGTs and drug transporters.  
•  Cenobamate inhibits the metabolism enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP2C19, 
CYP3A4/5, UGT2B7 and UGT1A1 and the drug transporters OATP1B1, 
OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2-K.  
•  In human hepatocyte assays, cenobamate induced CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4/5 activities, and CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Cenobamate  was  subjected  to  a  complete  programme  of  toxicity  testing  in  multiple  animal  species, 
including 
single-dose 
and 
repeat-dose 
toxicity, 
genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, 
and 
reproductive/developmental  toxicity.  Additional  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  cenobamate  for 
abuse potential in animal models of drug dependence.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice and rats, using the oral (gavage) and intravenous 
routes of administration.

Single dose toxicity studies comprised GLP studies in mice and rats using the oral and intravenous routes 
of  administration,  each  preceded  by  1  or  2  non-GLP  studies.  GLP  and  non-GLP  studies  in  mice  used 
different animal strains (CD-1 and CF-1 mice, respectively).  
In the GLP studies with oral administration, mice received doses of 0, 10, 30, 90 or 130 mg/kg/day and 
were  observed  for  8  days  post-doses;  rats  received  doses  of  0,  30,  60,  100  or  150  mg/kg  and  were 
observed for 14 days. There were transient CNS toxicity at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day in mice and at all doses in 
rats (from 30 mg/kg/day). A NOAEL could only be set for mice, at 30 mg/kg/day. Based of extrapolation 
of pharmacokinetic obtained from other studies, CNS toxicity occurred with low/null safety margins for 
the 400 mg/day human dose. The studies indicate, therefore, a risk of acute CNS toxicity. 
In the GLP studies with intravenous administration, mice received doses 0, 1, 3, 5 or 8 mg/kg and 
were observed for 7 days; rats received doses of 0, 1, 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day and were observed for 
14 days. No toxicity was observed in mice. Rats showed transient CNS toxicity at 45 mg/kg. The 
NOAEL for mice and rats were, therefore, set at 8 and 15 mg/kg, respectively. Based on extrapolation 
of pharmacokinetic obtained from another study (DMPK 05-01), CNS toxicity in rats occurred with no 
safety margin for the 400 mg/day human dose. 
No mortalities were observed in the GLP studies. In the non-GLP studies, mortalities were observed 
after the oral administration of 200 and ≥ 250 mg/kg to mice and rats, respectively, and intravenous 
administration of 10 mg/kg to mice.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys, all 
using the oral (gavage) route of administration.

 : Reduction in dose level due to toxicity 
Chronic toxicity studies included interim assessments – at 13 weeks in study in rats and at 13 and 26 
weeks in the study in monkeys - and recovery periods.  One of the studies in mice, which was conducted 
in  CByB6F1  mice  instead  of  CD-1  mice,  was  a  dose  range-finding  study  for  a  subsequent  26-week 
carcinogenicity  study  in  Tg.rasH2  mice.  The  only  study  in  rabbits  was  a  dose  range-finding  study  for 
subsequent  preliminary  toxicity  study  in  the  pregnant  rabbits.  One  of  the  studies  in  Cynomolgus 
monkeys, a 7-day study, included a single escalating MTD part. Except for 5 day and 14-day studies in 
mice and a 14-day study in Cynomolgus monkeys, all other studies were GLP-compliant. No issues were 
identified which could lead to question relevance of the animal species. 
In terms of toxicological findings, the longest-term study in mice (13-weeks study) showed cenobamate-
related  mortality  and  CNS  toxicity  at  ≥60  mg/kg/day  and  increases  in  liver  weight  correlated 
microscopically to centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy.  
In rats, the chronic toxicity study (26 weeks) showed mortality at the highest tested dose (48 mg/kg) 
and CNS toxicity at ≥ 24 mg/kg/day. In addition, there were changes in liver and kidneys, with increases 
in organs weights and histopathological changes – including centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and 
minimal  to  mild  multifocal  hepatocellular  necrosis,  in  the  liver,  and  degeneration/regeneration  and/or 
necrosis  in  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  proximal  convoluted  tubules,  in  the  kidney.  All  findings  were 
reversibly upon the recovery periods.  
The chronic toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys showed one death attributed to cenobamate and CNS 
toxicity  at  27  mg/kg/day,  a  dose  level  which,  due  to  toxicity,  was  reduced  to  22  mg/kg/day  from 
treatment Day 11 onwards. In addition, after a 52 weeks treatment (i.e. not observed at the 13 and 26 
week interim assessment) there were changes in liver, with increase in liver weight at ≥ 9 mg/kg and 
hepatocellular hypertrophy at ≥ 18 mg/kg/day, and an increase in the incidence and severity of minimal 
to mild lymphoid aggregate/follicle accumulation in bone marrow and thymus at ≥ 18 and ≥ 9 mg/kg/day, 
respectively.

Genotoxicity 
Non-mammalian Cell System: Ames Bacterial Reverse Mutation Tests (Studies No. 30/025 and No. 
AA30488) 
Under the experimental conditions of both studies, cenobamate did not induce any biologically 
significant increases in the number of revertants in the 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains used, either 
with or without metabolic activation. 
Mammalian Cell System: In Vitro Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test on L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma 
Cells TK+/- (Studies No. 30/026 and No. AA30489) 
It was concluded that cenobamate did not induce mutagenic effects in the Mammalian Cell Gene 
Mutation Test on L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma Cells – Tk+/- either with or without metabolic activation. 
Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Test in Rat Bone Marrow (Study No. 30/027) 
Under the experimental conditions and according to the criteria of the study plan, it was concluded that 
when administered by the oral route at slightly, to very toxic dose levels of 53, 94 or 168 mg/kg, 
cenobamate did not induce micronuclei in rat bone marrow erythrocytes. 
Carcinogenicity 
26-Week Carcinogenicity and Toxicokinetic Study in Tg.rasH2 Mice (Study No. SK13035) 
The  objective  of  this  GLP-compliant  study  was  to  evaluate  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  cenobamate 
following repeated oral administration for 26 weeks in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice and to establish the 
exposure of cenobamate in wild-type CByB6F1 mice. Cenobamate at once daily oral doses of 5, 15, and 
35  mg/kg/day  for  up  to  26  consecutive  weeks  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  neoplastic  lesions. 
Cenobamate was considered to not to have a carcinogenic potential in the Tg.rasH2 mouse. At Week 26, 
the  plasma  concentrations  of  cenobamate  2  hours  post-dose  in  male  and  female  animals  given  35 
mg/kg/day were 59.5 μg/mL and 54.5 μg/mL, respectively. 
104-Week Carcinogenicity and Toxicokinetic Study in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. SK13015) 
The objective of this GLP-compliant study was to evaluate the carcinogenic potential and TK profile of 
cenobamate when administered daily via oral gavage to Crl:CD (SD) rats for up to 104 weeks. No 
treatment related neoplastic findings were observed in male and female rats given 4, 8 or 20 
mg/kg/day cenobamate via oral gavage for up to 87 and 90 weeks, respectively.  No carcinogenicity 
potential was observed up to 20 mg/kg/day cenobamate. At the Week 26 interval, the respective 
exposure indices for cenobamate in plasma of male and female animals given 20 mg/kg/day were Cmax 
values of 13.0 μg/mL and 20.5 μg/mL and AUC24 values of 173 μg*h/mL and 232 μg*h/mL.

: Dose adjustments along study progress to increase systemic exposures  
In the male and female fertility and early embryonic development study (SK11003) there were neither 
effects on fertility and early embryonic development nor adverse general toxicity effects. Effects 
observed in the parental generation were limited to adaptive liver changes, with increase in liver 
weight and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy.  
Embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  rats  comprised  a  non-GLP  dose  range-finding  study  and  a  GLP 
pivotal study (Studies No. AA26091 and AA26092, respectively). In the pivotal study AA26092, female 
time-mated Sprague Dawley rats (25/dose) were dosed at 0, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg/day on GD 6 to GD 
17. There were clinical signs, mortality, and changes in body weight and food consumption among the 
maternal  animals.  There  were  no  treatment-related  macroscopic  findings  at  the  terminal  necropsy 
examination of the maternal animals. Embryo-foetal development was affected by an increase in post-
implantation loss, decrease in foetal weight and ossification. Foetal malformations were also observed. 
Five females given cenobamate at the dose level of 60 mg/kg/day were found dead or sacrificed in a 
moribund condition (between GD 10 and 19). Clinical signs prior to death or sacrifice of these females 
included  a  thin  appearance,  pallor,  subdued  behaviour,  prostration,  loss  of  balance  and  raised  hair. 
Similar clinical signs were noted amongst the remaining females in the 60 mg/kg/day group. A marked 
treatment  related  weight  loss  occurred  from  GD  6  to  11  at  60  mg/kg/day  and  mean  body  weight 
remained relatively low through to termination. There was a transient reduction on mean body weight 
gain  in  the  30  mg/kg/day  group  from  GD  6  to  11.  Consistent  with  the  effect  on  body  weight,  when 
compared with the control group, mean food consumption was reduced throughout the treatment period 
at 60 mg/kg/day and from GD 6 to 15 at 30 mg/kg/day. There were 25, 25, 24 and 19 pregnant females 
at  the  terminal  caesarean  sections  in  the  0,  10,  30  and  60  mg/kg/day  groups,  respectively.  The 
percentage post-implantation loss was higher in the 60 mg/kg/day dose group. Foetal weight was lower

at 60 mg/kg/day. Two foetuses at 60 mg/kg/day from separate litters had anophthalmia and one foetus 
from  each  of  the  30  and  60  mg/kg/day  groups  had  enlarged  ventricular  chambers.  It  is  noted  that 
anophthalmia and heart malformations are part of the background of changes for this strain of rat at the 
testing facility. There was an increased incidence of foetuses with reduced ossification in several areas 
of the skeleton in the 60 mg/kg/day group. The findings were consistent with generalised incomplete 
ossification in association with the reduced foetal weight in the high dose group. The NOEL for maternal 
toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity were established at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
In  the  dose  range-finding  study  30/021,  pregnant  rabbits  received  cenobamate  at  0,  20,  30  or  40 
mg/kg/day once daily from GD 6 to GD 19. The study showed maternal toxicity. Effects on embryo-foetal 
development were limited to a slight reduction in foetal body weight at 40 mg/kg/day. 
In the pivotal study 30/020, female time-mated New Zealand White rabbits were dosed at 0, 4, 12 or 
36 mg/kg/day once daily on GD 6 to GD 19. Among the maternal animals, there was no treatment 
related mortality or macroscopic changes at necropsy. There were clinical signs of toxicity and effects 
on body weight and food consumption. Embryo-foetal development was affected by a slight increase in 
embryo-foetal death. Changes in foetal sex ratios and foetal malformations were also observed. There 
were no effects in foetal body weight. The only treatment related clinical sign was an increased 
incidence of females with a persistent reduction in faecal output during the treatment period at 36 
mg/kg/day. There was a marked reduction in overall mean body weight gain and food consumption 
during the treatment period in the 36 mg/kg/day group. Recovery was noted during the post-
treatment period. Slight increase in in embryo-foetal death at 36 mg/kg/day. There was one foetus 
from the 4 mg/kg/day group with a mal-rotated hind limb. This is part of the normal background of 
findings for the strain of rabbit. There was no visceral foetal malformation detected in any group. There 
were malformed foetuses from 1, 3 and 2 litters in the 4, 12 and 36 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, 
with thoracic or lumber vertebral abnormalities that resulted in scoliosis for all foetuses but one. These 
findings were considered to be not associated with treatment. Although there was no similar finding in 
the concurrent control, the overall incidence of malformed foetuses (6/560: 1.1%) was less than in the 
historical control data (1.8% in 2002). In addition, these abnormalities are part of the normal 
background of findings for the strain of rabbit. The NOEL for both maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity 
was established at 12 mg/kg/day. 
In the pre- and post-natal study (Study No. SK13019; GLP), cenobamate was well tolerated by the F0 
dams. Treatment with cenobamate was not associated with mortality, effects on pregnancy or clinical 
signs during the gestation and lactation phases. Effects observed on F0 dams were limited to effects on 
body weight and food consumption. Among the F1 generation, effects were noted on body weight, 
post-weaning functional development and female reproductive competence. Treatment related adverse 
body weight loss and decreases in body weight gain were noted in females at 44 mg/kg/day from GD 6 
to 9, with comparable weights to control values thereafter (including the lactation period). Transient 
decreased body weight gain was observed at 11 and 22 mg/kg/day on GDs 6 to 9. Additionally, 
treatment related decreases in food consumption at 44 mg/kg/day from GD 6 to 9 was considered 
adverse but transient, with slight transient decreases also observed at 11 and 22 mg/kg/day from GD 
6 to 9. Among the F1 generation, slight treatment related decreases in absolute body weight and body 
weight gain were observed from PND 10 to 21 in males and females at 44 mg/kg/day, but were 
comparable to control values throughout the maturation, cohabitation, post-mating and gestation 
phases. Neurobehavioural impairment (learning and memory deficit and increased auditory startle 
response) was observed in the male offspring at all doses. Female reproductive effects at 44 
mg/kg/day consisted of increases in the number of early resorptions and percent pre- and post-
implantation loss, as well as decreases in the numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, and live 
foetuses. The maternal and F1 (pre- and post-natal development) NOAEL was established at 22 
mg/kg/day.

In the pivotal juvenile animal study SK15001, there were 28 unscheduled decedents during the study 
among the general toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and neurohistopathology subsets. Approximately 
two-thirds of the deaths occurred during the dosing period from PND 8 to PND 26 and represented 
animals across all treated groups. The remaining unscheduled deaths occurred from PND 52 to 116. 
These were primarily noted in the high dose groups (males and females). In most animals, the cause 
of death/moribundity could not be determined. There were transient effects in body weight and body 
weight gain in mid and high dose males (slight, statistically significant decreases). There were 
cenobamate-related decreases in both forelimb and hind limb grip strength in males and females at all 
doses. Furthermore, during the assessment of learning and memory, at PND 61 ± 2 there were test 
article-related effects (increased time to complete the maze and number of errors) in high dose males 
in most of the learning trials and the memory recall trials. However, all effects were reversible upon 
discontinuation of drug. High dose males had statistically significant increases in the day of preputial 
separation (+1 day) and body weight (+16.8 g) at acquisition. Cenobamate-related, minimal to 
moderate, dose-dependent increases in liver weights were present in males and females in all dose 
groups. Increased liver weights correlated microscopically with centrilobular hepatocellular 
hypertrophy. Additionally, in males, cenobamate-related, minimal to slight, dose-dependent increases 
in kidney weights were present at all dose levels. Increased kidney weights correlated microscopically 
with renal tubular hyaline droplet accumulation. After the recovery period, all organ weight differences 
noted at the end of dosing had recovered. Most neurohistopathological changes that were present in 
the tissues examined were observed in eyes of both vehicle control and high dose animals at similar 
incidences.  The only ocular lesion that was present at higher frequency in treated rats as compared to 
vehicle controls was dysplasia that involved the sclera, choroid, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) 
and retina of eyes from four high dose male animals and one vehicle control group female. These 
lesions were focal or multifocal, generally unilateral and were characterised by invaginations of cells 
through the retina that appeared to be hypertrophic and hyperplastic RPE cells with some evidence of 
vascular components and in some lesions a connective tissue component that was continuous with the 
sclera. It was considered that the nature and characteristics of the dysplastic ocular changes are 
consistent with a developmental origin.  The NOAEL was considered to be the low dose for both males 
and females (20/20/30/40 and 15/15/20/20 mg/kg/day, respectively). These dose levels corresponded 
to Cmax values of 9.5/9.4/12.2/17.4 μg/mL in males and 9.0/12.6/19.8/18.6 μg/mL in females, and to 
AUC24 values of 121/91.6/164/238 μg*h/mL in males and 94.9/173/284/260 μg*h/mL in females. 
Local Tolerance 
Since cenobamate is to be administered via oral route, no local tolerance studies were performed. 
Other toxicity studies 
As  cenobamate  is  acting  on  the  central  nervous  system,  5  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the 
potential for drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal. 
Drug Dependence and Withdrawal in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. SK13024) 
A 14-day dosing/7-day withdrawal study was run in male rats (8 animals/group). Oral doses of 0, 60 
and 100 mg/kg cenobamate and 50 mg/kg BID of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) were used. Once daily dosing 
of cenobamate for 14 days produced only a trend towards a reduced body weight increase on Day 7, 
which  persisted  throughout  the  dosing  and  withdrawal  phases.  Food  consumption  was  significantly 
reduced only on Day 2 of the dosing phase for animals given 60 or 100 mg/kg cenobamate. Similarly, a 
reduction in ambulatory and non-ambulatory activities occurred only on Day 1 of the dosing phase in 
Assessment report

animals  given  60  or  100  mg/kg  cenobamate.  Behavioural  changes  for  animals  given  cenobamate 
included minimally decreased activity on Days 1 and 7 in animals given 60 mg/kg and on Days 1, 7, and 
14 in animals given 100 mg/kg. In animals given 100 mg/kg, ataxia and hunched posture were noted 
on Days 1 and 7, respectively. During withdrawal, minimal and/or sporadic instances of slight increased 
activity  and  reactivity  were  noted  at  60  and  100  mg/kg,  and  minimal  instances  of  decreased  activity 
were noted on Days 20 and 19 for animals given 60 or 100 mg/kg, respectively. However, most animals 
were normal, and the majority of observations noted were diminished by Day 20 of the withdrawal phase, 
indicating these effects were reversible following dosing termination. 
Drug Discrimination Abuse Liability Study - Cross Generalization to Midazolam  
(Study No. SK13026) 
The abuse liability profile of cenobamate was assessed in a drug discrimination paradigm using the BZDs 
midazolam and diazepam. These data indicate that animals given ≤20 mg/kg cenobamate PO did not 
substitute  for  the  midazolam  training  cue  at  assessment  times  that  ranged  from  5  to  24  hours  post-
dose. Additionally, animals given 60 or 180 mg/kg cenobamate only exhibited partial substitution for the 
midazolam training cue, when tested approximately 5 hours post-dose.  
Drug Discrimination: Intraperitoneal drug discrimination abuse liability potential (Study No. SK16005) 
This study was conducted in male rats (16 animals/group) to examine the potential similarity of the 
interoceptive or subjective effects of cenobamate, to those engendered by the 1) 5HT2 (serotonin) 
hallucinogen, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI); 2) dopamine agonist, stimulant, 
d-amphetamine; 3) mu opioid agonist, CNS depressant, morphine; 4) gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)benzodiazepine-Cl ionophore complex agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP); and 5) cannabinoid 
agonist, CP 55,940. 
Cenobamate  did  not  engender  cross  generalisation  to  the  interoceptive  stimulus  properties  of  the 
selective  5HT2  agonist,  DOI,  or  the  mu  opiate  agonist  morphine  in  rats  trained  to  discriminate  the 
presence versus absence of 0.56 mg/kg of DOI or 3.2 mg/kg morphine, respectively. Cenobamate did 
produce partial generalisation to the dopamine agonist, d-amphetamine, at a single dose (20 mg/kg) 
and a single time point (20 minutes post-dose), and a dose-dependent complete cross generalisation 
with 5.6 mg/kg CDP.  
Self-administration potential 
In order to evaluate the potential reinforcing properties of cenobamate and to assess its relative abuse 
liability  profile,  cenobamate  was  tested  alongside  the  BZD  midazolam,  a  drug  with  known  reinforcing 
properties,  in  a  self-administration  study  in  26  male  Sprague-Dawley  rats.  Cenobamate  produced 
minimal to no reinforcing behaviour over a short duration of evaluation. Infusions of cenobamate, at all 
doses evaluated, were significantly lower compared with midazolam. Overall, cenobamate showed a low 
potential  for  drug  abuse  when  tested  in  animals  trained  to  self-administer  midazolam  over  a  short 
duration of evaluation. 
Study  No.  SK17004  (Chlordiazepoxide:  Place  Conditioning  in  Sprague-Dawley  Rats)  was  conducted. 
Chordiazepoxide was however found not to be an appropriate positive control/comparator in the study.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Primary  pharmacology  studies  demonstrate  that  cenobamate  exerts  a  dual  mechanism  of  action  with 
positive  allosteric  modulation  of  the  GABAA  receptors  at  a  non-benzodiazepine  binding  site  and 
enhancement of Na+ channel inactivation along with inhibition of the persistent component of the Na+ 
current. 
Cenobamate produced a dose-related inhibition of hind-limb tonic-extension seizures in mice and rats 
subjected to the maximal electroshock seizure test, which is used to identify compounds that prevent 
seizure spread. There was no difference in protection between animals that had received only a single 
dose  and  those  that  had  been  treated  for  5  days,  suggesting  no  development  of  tolerance.  In  mice, 
cenobamate inhibited seizures in the 6 Hz corneal stimulation model, which is a model of psychomotor 
seizures and therapy-resistant epilepsy.  
Cenobamate  inhibited  clonic  seizures  induced  by  pentylenetetrazol  in  mice  and  rats.  These  results, 
combined with the results of the studies of the effects of cenobamate on seizure expression and after-
discharge  duration  in  the  rapid  hippocampal  kindling  model  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  suggest  that 
cenobamate does not potentiate seizure initiation and may be efficacious against focal seizures.  
Cenobamate also produced a dose-dependent inhibition of seizures induced by picrotoxin or bicuculline, 
which  provoke  seizures  via  their  antagonism  of  GABAA  receptors.  This correlates  with  the  positive 
modulating effect of cenobamate on GABA-induced currents. 
Cenobamate was efficacious in the GAERS rat genetic model of absence epilepsy suggesting it may be 
effective in treating this type of generalised seizures. 
Cenobamate  produced  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  seizures  in  rats  treated  with  the  cholinergic 
muscarinic  agent  pilocarpine  (inducing  sustained  convulsions  similar  to  status  epilepticus)  along  with 
lithium carbonate to lower seizure threshold.  
Studies  to  investigate  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  cenobamate  have  centred  around  the 
effects of the drug on overall behaviour. 
Cenobamate did not significantly reverse scopolamine-induced memory impairment when administered 
intraperitoneally.  However,  cenobamate  was  found  to  potentiate  ethanol-induced  anesthesia  and 
hexobarbital sleeping time at doses of 30 mg/kg and above. Cenobamate did not potentiate L-5-HTP-
induced head twitches thereby exhibiting neither MAO-A inhibition nor 5-HT2A receptor agonist activity. 
However, cenobamate dose-dependently antagonised the DOI-induced head twitch response exhibiting 
5-HT2A receptor antagonism activity in mice. 
Two non-GLP Irwin screening studies were conducted to establish the tolerability of cenobamate. The 
maximum  tolerated  dose  (based  on  CNS  signs  such  as  decreased  activity,  ataxia,  ptosis  and  loss  of 
righting reflex) was 200 mg/kg orally in rats. A significant increase in ataxia and ptosis with decreased 
locomotor activity, muscle tone and motor function were also observed at 100 mg/kg.  
The  cardiovascular  effects  of  cenobamate  were  assessed  in  a  standard  battery  of  in  vitro  studies  as 
described in the ICH S7 guidelines. Cenobamate is considered to have a small risk for hERG inhibition as 
the IC50 in the hERG assay (1,869 μM) is 11-fold higher than the clinical steady state Cmax observed after 
the 400 mg/day dose and 27-fold higher than the free drug plasma levels at steady state. 
In isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, cenobamate exhibits some QT interval-shortening effects at 100 μM in 
the rabbit, which is slightly more than the free drug plasma levels at steady state (68 μM) in human 
Assessment report

patients  at  the  400  mg/day  dose.  The  clinical  significance  of  the  QT  interval  shortening  is  further 
investigated and discussed in the clinical sections. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Cenobamate  is  highly  soluble  and  highly  permeable  in  water.  Oral  bioavailability  of  cenobamate  is 
generally  moderate  to  high  in  mice,  rats  and  monkeys,  and  very  low  in  dogs.  The  clearance  of 
cenobamate is very low in mice, rats and monkeys at 1.2% to 7.3% of hepatic plasma flow whereas the 
clearance in dogs is high at 60% of hepatic plasma flow. 
After  repeated  dose  administrations,  systemic  exposures  to  cenobamate  generally  increased  dose-
proportionally in both male and female animals. Compared to male animals, exposures were generally 
similar or slightly higher for female animals. Systemic exposures in rats were lower after repeated dosing 
compared to single dose which correlated to potential auto-induction as indicated by increased CYP and 
UGT activities in ex vivo analyses. After repeated doses of cenobamate in monkeys, there was generally 
no to slight accumulation of drug.  
Plasma protein binding of cenobamate was low to moderate (35-71%) in all species tested and it bound 
to human albumin protein (66.7%) but not to α1-acid glycoprotein. In a rat tissue distribution study with 
[14C]-cenobamate,  most  of  the  mean  tissue-to-blood  ratios  were  near  1.0  including  brain  indicating 
cenobamate was well distributed in the body. The kidney had the highest tissue-to-blood ratios followed 
by  the  liver.  Placental  transfer  of  cenobamate  was  confirmed  by  the  presence  of  cenobamate in  both 
amniotic fluid and fetal blood from pregnant rats. Even though rat breast milk was not evaluated, based 
on the tissue distribution data, cenobamate is likely to be present in milk.  
Cenobamate was extensively metabolised as shown by the low levels of parent drug in excreta, ranging 
from 6.8% in humans to 18.5% in mice. N-Glucuronide (M1) represented the major clearance pathway 
for cenobamate in humans and monkeys. For humans, two other metabolites accounted for ≥10% of 
the  excreted  dose;  M2b  and  the  dihydrodiol  metabolites  combined  (M6  and  M7).  No  in  vivo  chiral 
inversion of cenobamate (R-enantiomer) to its S-enantiomer was observed in plasma from rats, monkeys 
or humans. Monkey had a similar metabolic profile as the human profile. The mouse, rat and rabbit were 
also  confirmed  to  be  appropriate  toxicology  species  given  the  qualitative  similarities  in  metabolism 
compared to the human profile where cenobamate was the major circulating component in plasma and 
sufficient oral absorption to produce CNS toxicity. As no major circulating metabolites (≥10% of the dose) 
were observed in human or nonclinical species, no additional testing of metabolites was conducted. This 
is agreed. 
After single oral doses of [14C]-cenobamate, most of the radioactivity (≥94.0% of the dose) was excreted 
within 168 hours for all species. Nonclinical species generally showed similar extent of urinary excretion 
of cenobamate compared to humans (87.8% of the dose eliminated within 312 hours). 
Multiple CYP- and UGT-enzymes have been shown to be involved with the metabolism of cenobamate 
including UGT2B7, CYP2E1, CYP2A6 and CYP2B6. Other metabolic enzymes including UGT2B4, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 may also be involved to a minor extent. Cenobamate inhibits CYP2B6 and 
CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4/5, UGT2B7 and UGT1A1.  
In vitro transporter inhibition data suggests cenobamate has the potential to interact with substrates of 
the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1, and the renal uptake transporters OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2-
K. 
Therefore,  based  on  these  in  vitro  data  and  the  clinically  relevant  inhibition  of  multiple  CYP  enzymes 
(CYP2B6, 2C19, and 3A) and both UGT enzymes (UGT1A1 and UGT2B7) as well as the inhibition of the 
drug transporters OATP1B1, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2-K, cenobamate is predicted to cause a number of 
Assessment report

interactions with medicinal products. This was further investigated and assessed in a pharmacokinetic 
study  (YKP3089C026).  In  addition,  the  applicant  conducted  five  drug-drug  interactions  studies  and  a 
population PK analysis to assess the effects of cenobamate on the PK of other anti-epileptic drugs (see 
clinical sections) 
Toxicology 
Cenobamate  was  subjected  to  a  complete  programme  of  toxicity  testing  in  multiple  animal  species, 
including 
single-dose 
and 
repeat-dose 
toxicity, 
genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, 
and 
reproductive/developmental  toxicity.  Additional  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  cenobamate  for 
abuse potential in animal models of drug dependence.  
Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice and rats, using the oral and intravenous routes of 
administration. Additionally, an oral single escalating MTD study was conducted in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Significant clinical signs included ataxia, tremor, loss of righting reflex, immobility and 
decreased respiration. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys, using 
the oral route of administration. The longest-term studies in mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys all 
showed CNS toxicity, mortality, and changes in the liver comprising increase in weight and 
centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy. Additionally, rats showed hepatocellular necrosis, considered 
secondary to the centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, and changes in kidneys without a human 
counterpart. Monkeys showed lymphoid aggregates in bone marrow and thymus considered to be of 
uncertain/limited relevance to humans. Shorter terms studies also revealed thymic atrophy and 
lymphoid necrosis in the thymus and lymph nodes in rats, and few dark red areas of the thymus in 
monkeys. Based on systemic exposures, the observed changes occurred with low or no safety margins 
to humans at the intended maximum clinical dose of 400 mg/day.  
Cenobamate did not show genotoxicity in the 3 genotoxicity studies. Furthermore, the histopathology 
data from the repeat dose toxicity studies did not suggest a proliferative response to exposure to 
cenobamate. These results further translate into a lack of a carcinogenic potential in the 6-month 
Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse and 2-year rat studies.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies comprised a fertility and early embryonic 
development study, 4 embryo-foetal development studies (including the dose-range finding studies), a 
prenatal and postnatal development study and 3 studies with direct dosing of the offspring. 
Administration of cenobamate during pre-mating, cohabitation, or gestation/post-mating phases was 
well-tolerated by male and female rats with no treatment related mortalities. There were no effects on 
oestrous cycling, male or female fertility or mating indices, sperm motility, count, and morphology, or 
Caesarean section parameters.  
There were adverse effects on embryo-foetal development at dose levels toxic for the mothers in the 
embryo-foetal development studies conducted both in rats and rabbits (reduction in the number of viable 
foetuses,  reduction  in  foetal  body  weight  and  ossification  in  rat  and  slight  increase  in  foetal  death  in 
rabbits).  Furthermore,  in  the  rat  study,  there  were  4  foetuses  with  visceral  malformations  (at  60 
mg/kg/day, 2 foetuses from separate litters with anophthalmia and 1 foetus with enlarged ventricular 
chambers;  at  30  mg/kg/day,  one  foetus  with  enlarged  ventricular  chambers).  It  was  estimated  that, 
both in rats and rabbits, systemic exposures at the NOAEL and maximum tested doses were lower than 
human exposure at the intended maximum clinical dose of 400 mg/day 
The pre-post-natal development study conducted in rats showed transplacental passage of cenobamate 
and adverse effects both in the mothers and in the offspring. Effects observed among the F1 
generation animals comprised lower body weights, which was transient, learning and memory deficits

and increased auditory startle response, observed in males at all doses, and a decrease in female 
reproductive competence at the high dose. Systemic exposures at both the NOAEL and maximum 
tested dose were lower than human exposure at the intended maximum clinical dose of 400 mg/day. 
Due to the inadequate number of foetuses examined, no definitive conclusion could be drawn and the 
full teratogenic potential of cenobamate could not be established. The CHMP noted that the rat embryo-
foetal development study is being repeated and the applicant will provide the study report once finalised. 
Even though the observed malformations may be considered part of the background and without obvious 
association to treatment, the reproductive toxicity studies showed adverse effects on embryo-foetal and 
postnatal development occurring at lower systemic exposures than the anticipated therapeutic levels in 
humans. The CHMP agreed that the information, the relevant risks and recommendations, including the 
need to use an effective contraception during the treatment and until 4 weeks after discontinuation and 
– for precautionary measures - to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment are correctly reflected in 
sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Five  studies  were  also  conducted  to  assess  the  drug  abuse  liability  and  dependence  potential  of 
cenobamate (drug discrimination, self-administration and drug dependence). Cenobamate showed a low 
potential for drug abuse when tested in animals trained to self-administer midazolam. It did engender 
partial  generalisation  to  d-amphetamine  at  a  single  time-point  and  complete  cross  generalisation  to 
chlordiazepoxide.  Overall,  cenobamate  is  considered  to  have  some  potential  for  drug  abuse  or 
dependence  liability  in  humans  and  this  was  further  investigated  in  the  clinical  aspects  (see 
pharmacology and clinical safety discussions). 
Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for cenobamate was prepared in accordance with the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use - 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*, 01 June 2006). Based on PEC results (≥0.01 threshold), a phase 
II assessment was required. Considering the available data, it can be concluded that cenobamate is 
not biodegradable. The ecotoxicological studies did not demonstrated expected risk to surface waters. 
The trigger value for adsorption to sewage sludge is not exceeded. However, the results demonstrate 
that cenobamate would have medium to high mobility in soils. The shifting of cenobamate to sediment 
was >10% by day 14, requiring a sediment effect study. The dissipation rates of cenobamate 
normalised to 12° showed that cenobamate is potentially very persistent (vP) in aquatic systems. No 
risks were identified by the calculated PEC/PNEC ratio(s) (RQ). 
The relevant information (cenobamate is very persistent (vP) in aquatic systems) is correctly reflected 
in the Product Information.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK characteristics of cenobamate were determined based on studies using human biomaterials, 26 
clinical studies with PK data, and 2 population PK analyses. 
Analytical methods 
Plasma concentrations of cenobamate were determined using validated bioanalytical methods developed 
according  to  the  “FDA  Guidance  for  Industry  -  Bioanalytical  Method  Validation,  2001”  and  EMA’s 
“Guideline on bioanalytical method validation, 2012” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) 
for methods conducted after release of this guidance in 2012. 
The  determination  of  other  drugs  used  in  dedicated  drug-drug  interactions  with  ASMs  (phenytoin, 
phenobarbital,  carbamazepine,  valproic  acid),  oral  contraceptives  (ethinyl  estradiol,  norethindrone), 
CYP450  probes  (bupropion,  warfarin,  omeprazole,  and  midazolam),  and  special  studies  (alcohol, 
alprazolam) was performed by different bioanalytical laboratories using validated methods. 
Single Ascending Oral Dose Study in Healthy Volunteers (Study AA22780) 
Objectives: to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of cenobamate after single oral doses ranging 
from 5 to 750 mg in healthy male subjects.

Figure 3 
Conclusions: 
• Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner after single doses from 5 to 750 mg. 
• AUC increased more than proportionally with single doses from 5 to 750 mg. 
• Multiple peaks in the individual concentration vs time curves suggest that cenobamate undergoes 
entero-hepatic recirculation.

(Study YKP3089C031) 
Objectives: to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of cenobamate after single oral doses ranging 
from 50 to 400 mg in healthy Japanese male subjects.

Conclusions: 
• Cenobamate Cmax increased proportionally with dose after single doses of 50 to 400 mg. 
• AUC increased more than proportionally with increasing single doses between 50 and 400 mg. 
Mass Balance Study With 14C-Labeled Cenobamate (Study AA41857) 
Objectives: to assess the mass balance of cenobamate following a single oral dose of 14C-labeled 
cenobamate and to determine the PK parameters from total radioactivity and cenobamate 
concentrations in plasma, to examine cenobamate erythrocyte/plasma partitioning, and to collect 
plasma, urine, and faeces for metabolite profiling.

Figure 7 
Figure 8 
Conclusions: 
• The majority of a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-cenobamate reached the plasma unchanged, with 
little evidence of pre-systemic metabolism, suggesting high bioavailability. 
• 88% of the administered dose was recovered in urine, indicating cenobamate has high permeability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 43/122 
 
 
 
 
 
• Only ~6% of the administered dose recovered in the urine was unchanged drug, indicating 
cenobamate is extensively metabolised, with the metabolites being excreted in the urine. 
• Blood:plasma total radioactivity ratio (0.6) and mean erythrocyte transfer ratios and 
erythrocyte/plasma partition coefficients (<0.15), indicate cenobamate and its metabolites did not 
exhibit any relevant binding to red blood cells. 
Multiple Ascending Oral Dose Study in Healthy Volunteers (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg Once 
Daily) (Study AA24143) 
Objectives: To assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of cenobamate following multiple ascending doses 
of cenobamate from 50 mg to 200 mg in healthy male and female subjects.

Relative Bioavailability of 50 mg and 200 mg Tablet Strengths versus 100 mg Tablet Strength (Study 
YKP3089C032) 
Objectives: To assess the relative bioavailability of 2×50 mg tablets compared to 1×100 mg tablet and 
to assess the relative bioavailability of 2×100 mg tablets compared to 1×200 mg tablet under fasted 
conditions, to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of the 200 mg tablet, to assess 
intrasubject variability of the 200 mg strength dose under fasted conditions. 
Conclusions:  
• Two 100 mg cenobamate tablets are bioequivalent to one 200 mg tablet for both rate (Cmax) and 
extent (AUC) of absorption of cenobamate. 
• Two cenobamate 50 mg tablets are bioequivalent to one cenobamate 100 mg tablet for both rate 
(Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption of cenobamate. 
• There is no effect of food (as a high-fat high-calorie breakfast) on the relative bioavailability of 
cenobamate 200 mg tablets. 
• Intrasubject variability and intersubject variability for cenobamate are relatively low for the highest 
oral tablet strength formulation (200 mg). 
Food Effect Using Capsule Formulation (Study AA39450) 
The study showed that there is no effect of food (as a high-fat high-calorie breakfast) on the relative 
bioavailability of cenobamate 3×100 mg capsules. 
Effect of Age (Study YKP3089C030) 
Objectives: To assess the PK, safety and tolerability of cenobamate in healthy elderly subjects 
compared to healthy young adult subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 48/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 18 
Conclusions: 
• No effect of age on cenobamate Cmax was observed, and the slight increase in AUC in elderly 
subjects was not considered clinically meaningful. 
Effect of Renal Impairment (Study YKP3089C028)  
Objectives: To investigate the effect of renal impairment on the PK and the safety and tolerability of 
cenobamate in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. 
Figure 19 
Conclusions: 
• Systemic exposures (AUC) of cenobamate were 1.4- to 1.5-fold higher in subjects with mild (GFR 60 
to <90 mL/min) or moderate (30 to <60 mL/min) renal impairment relative to subjects with normal 
renal function after a single cenobamate 200 mg dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 49/122 
 
 
 
 
 
• Subjects with severely impaired renal function (GFR <30, not requiring dialysis) did not have 
clinically relevant differences in exposures (Cmax and AUC) after a single cenobamate 100 mg dose 
relative to subjects with normal renal function. 
• The results from the severe RI group were unanticipated (plasma exposure apparently lower than for 
the normal renal function group after dose normalisation) and possibly related to a difference in PK at 
a lower dose of cenobamate in the severe RI group (100 mg vs. 200 mg). 
Effect of Hepatic Impairment (Study YKP3089C027) 
Objectives: To investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK and the safety and tolerability of 
cenobamate in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. 
Figure 20 
Conclusions: 
• Systemic exposures (AUC) of cenobamate were 1.9-fold and 2.3-fold higher in subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
hepatic function after a single cenobamate 200 mg dose. 
Divalproex Sodium Interaction Study in Healthy Subjects (Study YKP3089C010) 
Objectives: To assess the effect of a multiple dose regimen of cenobamate on the plasma PK of 
divalproex in healthy subjects and to assess the effect of a multiple-dose regimen of divalproex on the 
plasma PK of cenobamate in healthy subjects. There were no drug interactions between cenobamate 
and divalproex following once daily 150 mg dose of cenobamate. 
Phenytoin Interaction Study in Healthy Adult Subjects (Study YKP3089C016) 
Objectives: To determine the effect of multiple doses of cenobamate on the PK of phenytoin and to 
determine the effect of multiple doses of phenytoin on the PK of cenobamate when given orally to 
healthy subjects. 
Conclusions: 
• Cenobamate 200 mg/day increased phenytoin exposures (Cmax +67% and AUC0-τ +84%) when co-
administered with phenytoin 300 mg/day. 
• Phenytoin 300 mg/day reduced cenobamate exposures (Cmax -27% and AUC0-τ -28%) when co-
administered with cenobamate 200 mg/day. 
Phenobarbital Interaction Study in Healthy Adult Subjects (Study YKP3089C022) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 50/122 
 
 
 
 
Objectives: To assess the effect of cenobamate on the PK of phenobarbital at steady state, to assess 
the effect of phenobarbital on the PK of cenobamate at steady state using historical data of 
cenobamate administered alone and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cenobamate and 
phenobarbital when co-administered. 
Co-administration of phenobarbital 90 mg/day with cenobamate 200 mg/day increased phenobarbital 
exposures (Cmax,ss +34% and AUC0-τ +37%), but reduced cenobamate AUC (-15%). 
Carbamazepine Interaction Study in Healthy Adult Subjects (Study YKP3089C011) 
Objectives: To determine the effect of multiple doses of cenobamate on the PK of carbamazepine and 
to determine the effect of multiple doses of carbamazepine on the PK of cenobamate given orally to 
healthy subjects.  
Conclusions: 
• Cenobamate 200 mg/day reduced carbamazepine exposures (Cmax -34% and AUCtau -35%). 
However, this result is likely an over-estimate of the effect due to insufficient time (<3 weeks) for 
CYP3A4 autoinduction by carbamazepine. 
• Co-administration of carbamazepine 200 mg BID and cenobamate 200 mg QD does not appear to 
affect cenobamate exposures, but this result is limited by the lack of a washout after carbamazepine 
co-administration. 
Carbamazepine Interaction Study in Healthy Adult Subjects (Study YKP3089C014) 
Objectives: To confirm the possible effect of cenobamate on carbamazepine disposition and to assess 
safety and tolerability when cenobamate and carbamazepine were co-administrated. 
Conclusions: 
• Co-administration of cenobamate 200 mg/day with carbamazepine 200 mg BID reduced 
carbamazepine exposures (Cmax -23% and AUCtau -24%) and increased plasma exposures of 
carbamazepine epoxide (Cmax +28% and AUCtau +20%). This result is more representative of the 
effect of cenobamate on carbamazepine than the first study (YKP3089C011) since autoinduction of 
CYP3A4 (4 weeks) was accounted for in the study design. 
• The decrease in carbamazepine exposure and increase in its epoxide metabolite exposure confirmed 
that cenobamate 200 mg/day is a weak inducer of CYP3A4. 
Reciprocal Effects of Co-administered Oral Contraceptives (Study YKP3089C006) 
Objectives: To assess the effect of a multiple-dose regimen of cenobamate on the PK of oral 
contraceptives in healthy adult female subjects, to assess the effect of a multiple-dose regimen of oral 
contraceptives on the PK of cenobamate, and to assess the safety and tolerability of the co-
administration of cenobamate with oral contraceptives. 
Conclusions: 
• Co-administration of cenobamate 100 mg/day with Ortho-Novum 1/35® increased the exposure of 
norethindrone (AUC0-τ +37%) but did not have a clinically relevant effect on Cmax or the exposure of 
ethinyl estradiol. 
• Co-administration of Ortho-Novum 1/35® with cenobamate had no relevant effect on the PK of 
cenobamate. 
Effects on Co-administered P450 Substrates (Study YKP3089C026) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 51/122 
 
 
 
Objectives: To assess the influence of cenobamate on the PK of CYP probe drugs (midazolam [CYP3A], 
warfarin [CYP2C9], omeprazole [CYP2C19], and bupropion [CYP2B6]) as a means of predicting DDIs. 
Conclusions: 
• Cenobamate 200 mg/day reduced exposures of bupropion (Cmax -23% and AUClast -39%), and 
increased the metabolite-to-parent ratios (4-fold), indicating that cenobamate induces CYP2B6. 
• Cenobamate 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day reduced exposures of midazolam (Cmax -27% and 
AUClast -27% at 100 mg/day; Cmax -61% and AUClast -72% at 200 mg/day), and increased the 1-
hydroxymidazolam metabolite-to-parent ratios (2-fold at 100 mg/day and 5-fold at 200 mg/day), 
indicating cenobamate induces CYP3A4. 
• Cenobamate 200 mg/day increased exposures of omeprazole (Cmax +83% and AUClast +107%), 
and decreased the 5-hydroxyomeprazole metabolite-to-parent ratios (4.5-fold), indicating cenobamate 
inhibits CYP2C19. 
• Cenobamate 200 mg/day did not affect the activity of CYP2C9 isoenzyme  
Reciprocal Effects of Co-administered Alcohol (Study YKP3089C029) 
Objectives: To compare the pharmacodynamics effects and PK of a single dose of cenobamate, of 
ethanol, and of the combination of cenobamate and ethanol. 
Co-administration of 200 mg cenobamate and alcohol does not alter the exposures of either 
cenobamate or ethanol. 
Population PK Model of Cenobamate (Study SK16007) 
Objectives: To describe the plasma concentration time profiles and characterise the variability in the 
PK of cenobamate after oral administration, to identify relevant covariates, such as age, weight, body 
surface area (BSA), body mass index, race/ethnicity, gender, CLcr, bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, and concomitant ASM medications (carbamazepine, clobazam, lacosamide, lamotrigine, 
levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and valproic acid) that may potentially influence the PK of 
cenobamate. 
The analysis includes data from 8 Phase 1 studies (included healthy (AA22780, AA24143, 
YKP3089C009, YKP3089C018, and YKP3089C006), elderly (YKP3089C030), renal impaired 
(YKP3089C028), and hepatic impaired (YKP3089C027) subjects), 2 adequate and well-controlled 
studies (YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017), and 1 Phase 3 open-label safety study (YKP3089C021) in 
epilepsy patients. 
Conclusions: 
• Cenobamate PK was well described by a model with first-order absorption following an absorption 
lag, followed by 2-compartment disposition and elimination. 
• There is low to moderate inter-individual variability in CL/F, leading to less overlap in exposure 
between doses. 
• Cenobamate exposures may be 
20% higher in underweight subjects and 
20% lower in obese 
subjects. 
∼
∼
• Co-administration of clobazam with cenobamate 100, 200, or 400 mg/day is predicted to increase 
cenobamate exposures (AUC +24%); however, this change is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
• While there were statistically significant effects of bilirubin, carbamazepine, and race on CL/F or 
V1/F, these effects were all small and were not clinically relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 52/122 
 
 
 
• Lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and valproic acid did not 
significantly affect the disposition of cenobamate. 
• The need to adjust the cenobamate dose based on these results would be most likely limited because 
cenobamate would be slowly titrated to an effective dose. 
Population PK Model to Assess the Effect of Cenobamate on the PK of Concomitant ASMs (Study 
SK16006) 
Objectives: To develop Population PK models describing how cenobamate affects exposure to other 
commonly used ASMs when given as adjunct therapy. 
The analysis includes data from the clinical studies YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017 and YKP3089C021 in 
epilepsy patients. 
Conclusions: 
• There are no clinically relevant changes in ASM concentrations when cenobamate 100 mg/day is 
administered concomitantly with any of the ASMs. 
• When cenobamate 200 mg/day is coadministered with ASMs, no clinically changes in ASM 
concentrations is predicted with the exception of a 35% reduction in lamotrigine concentrations. 
• When cenobamate 400 mg/day is coadministered with ASMs, phenytoin concentrations are expected 
to be 60% higher, carbamazepine concentrations are expected to be 
35% lower, and lamotrigine 
concentrations are expected to be 
50% lower. 
∼
• Insufficient data were available to predict the effect of cenobamate on concentrations of 
∼
phenobarbital, lacosamide, clobazam, perampanel, topiramate. 
Absorption  
As cenobamate was never administered intravenous, its oral bioavailability is unknown. However, 
based on the mass balance study AA41857, where 88% of the dose was collected in the urine and on 
the very low clearance, the bioavailability is expected to be high. Cenobamate should be considered as 
a BCS class 1 drug, with high permeability and high solubility. Its absorption is very fast with a Tmax 
around 2 to 3.5 hours post-dose. Multiple late peaks were observed suggesting enterohepatic 
recirculation. No major food effect was observed for cenobamate after a high-fat high-calorie meal, 
with bioequivalence in Cmax and AUC between fasting and fed conditions. 
Distribution 
Cenobamate volume of distribution in most of the studies was in the order of 40-50L. Plasma protein 
binding is approximately 60% and independent of the plasma concentration. Whole blood to plasma 
ratio of cenobamate is 0.60. 
Elimination and Metabolism 
The elimination half-life of cenobamate is around 50h, and is mainly eliminated by the urine as 
metabolites, with only a small fraction of the dose (around 7%) appearing in the urine as cenobamate. 
Almost no cenobamate appears in the faeces.  
Cenobamate is extensively metabolised to multiple metabolites that are further metabolised and/or 
excreted primarily in urine. Cenobamate is metabolised by both UGT conjugation and CYP oxidation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 53/122 
 
 
 
UGT enzymes include UGT2B7 and to a lesser extent UGT2B4, and CYP enzymes include CYP2E1, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.  
The mass balance study showed that the majority of a single 400 mg dose reached the plasma 
unchanged, with little evidence of pre-systemic metabolism. No major metabolites (i.e. >10% of total 
drug-related material) were identified in human plasma. The N-glucuronide of cenobamate (M1) was 
the only circulating metabolite detected in plasma and its exposure (AUC) was found to be 1.2% of the 
parent drug. M1 metabolite is also the main specie appearing in the excreta, with a cumulative of 
39.43% of the dose until the 264h post dose. Other relevant metabolites are the O-glucuronide (M2a) 
with 17.52% and the dihydrodiol diastereomer (M7) with 8.15% of the dose.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Cenobamate PK seems to be linear across the therapeutic dose range of 100 to 400 mg/day in steady 
state. However systemic exposures increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses less 
than 100-200 mg/day in single dose. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Cenobamate exposure increases with the reduction of the renal function. This increase is in the order 
of 1.5 times for both mild and moderate impaired subjects. For the severe impaired subjects, results 
are contradictory with a similar exposure to the healthy subjects.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Systemic exposures (AUC) of cenobamate were 1.9-fold and 2.3-fold higher in subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
hepatic function after a single cenobamate 200 mg dose.  
Weight 
Simulations using the population PK model showed that subjects with low weights may have ~25% 
higher cenobamate exposures and those with high weights may have ~20% lower exposures than 
those with mean weights.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of Concomitant ASMs on the PK of Cenobamate 
Based on results from dedicated studies and population PK analyses, some antiepileptic drugs (ASMs) 
had an effect on cenobamate exposures. 
The effects of ASMs on the PK of cenobamate from the dedicated studies showed that phenobarbital and 
phenytoin decreased cenobamate exposures, but neither divalproex nor carbamazepine had an effect on 
cenobamate exposure.

The population PK study SK16007 showed that carbamazepine and clobazam both significantly affected 
the oral clearance of cenobamate by a 15% increase and a 19% decrease, respectively. Simulations 
showed that the effects of carbamazepine on cenobamate AUC were not clinically relevant given that 
the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratio were within the 80 to 125 bounds. Clobazam 
increased the AUC of cenobamate by approximately 24%. The other ASMs tested were not found to 
affect significantly the disposition of cenobamate. 
Effect of Cenobamate on PK of Concomitant ASMs 
Based on results from dedicated studies and population PK analyses, cenobamate increases exposures 
of  phenobarbital  and  phenytoin,  reduces  exposures  of  lamotrigine  and  carbamazepine,  and  has  no 
relevant effect on levetiracetam, valproic acid, or oxcarbazepine.

The population PK Study SK16006 showed the following: 
• There was no clinically relevant effect of cenobamate on valproic acid, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam 
concentrations during treatment with cenobamate over the 100 to 400 mg/day dose range, 
•  There  is  a  dose-dependent  decrease  in  carbamazepine  concentrations  during  treatment  with 
cenobamate over the 100 (-11%) to 400 mg/day (-34%) dose range, 
• There is a dose-dependent decrease in lamotrigine concentrations during treatment with cenobamate 
over the 100 (-21%) to 400 mg/day (-52%) dose range, 
•  There  is  a  dose-dependent increase  in  phenytoin concentrations  during  treatment  with  cenobamate 
over the 100 (+10%) to 400 mg/day (+60%) dose range, 
•  Insufficient  data  were  available  to  estimate  the  effect  of  cenobamate  on  the  PK  of  phenobarbital, 
lacosamide, clobazam, perampanel, or topiramate. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD characteristics of cenobamate were determined using exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints 
in the early-phase studies to investigate the primary pharmacology and the exposure/effect. A PK-PD 
exposure-response Model was also developed to support the selected dosing regimen. A cardiac safety 
study was conducted to evaluate the risk of QT/QTc prolongation. In addition, a dedicated Proof of 
Principle study to evaluate the PD effect with a Photo-Induced Paroxysmal EEG-Response, together 
with a human abuse potential study and an alcohol interaction study, contributed to the PD profile 
assessment of cenobamate. 
Mechanism of action 
Cenobamate is a small molecule with a dual mechanism of action. It is a positive allosteric modulator 
of subtypes of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ion channel, that does not bind to the benzodiazepine 
binding site. Cenobamate has also been shown to reduce repetitive neuronal firing by enhancing the 
inactivation of sodium channels and by inhibiting the persistent component of the sodium current. The 
precise mechanism of action by which cenobamate exercises its therapeutic effects in patients with 
focal-onset seizures is unknown.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary Pharmacology 
Primary PD is based on clinical data from the 2 clinical phase 2 studies (C013 and C017) and a small 
Proof of Principle study (AA40616). 
Proof of Principle study (AA40616) - Effect of Cenobamate on Photo-paroxysmal Response in Epilepsy 
Subjects Phase 2a, non-randomised, uncontrolled, single blind (blinded subjects in the clinical phase 
and blinded clinical expert for electroencephalogram (EEG) interpretation), increased single dose from 
100 to 400 mg/day with 48-hour observation period, to evaluate the onset and duration of the PD 
effect of cenobamate. 
The primary objective of the study was to explore the PD effect of cenobamate on the intermittent 
photic stimulation (IPS) induced photo-paroxysmal EEG response in subjects with epilepsy. The 
secondary objectives were to assess the temporal relationship of this antiepileptic effect with plasma 
concentrations of cenobamate and, to assess the tolerability of a single dose of cenobamate in subjects 
with epilepsy. 
Figure 21 
The relationship between the peak (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-24, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) of exposure and 
cenobamate effect on IPS sensitivity is presented for the 11 records (6 patients).  
AUC0-t values in the range of 1-200 μg*h/mL (for 100 mg dose) resulted in partial suppression of IPS 
sensitivity in 1 out of 3 (33%) subjects and 2 out of 3 (66.7%) subjects did not have a response in 
suppression of IPS sensitivity. AUC0-t values in the range of 401-600 μg*h/mL resulted in complete 
suppression in 2 out of 2 (100%) subjects with 250 mg (n=1) and 400 mg (n=1) dose levels. AUC0-t

values of 201-400 μg*h/mL resulted in partial suppression of IPS sensitivity in 4 out of 6 (67%) 
subjects with 250 mg (n=3) and 400 mg (n=1) dose levels.  
Dose-responses studies (C013 and C017) 
See clinical efficacy sections. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Human abuse liability study (YKP3089C024): Phase 1, Single-dose, randomised, DB, PBO/active-
controlled, double-dummy, 10-sequence, 5-way crossover. Primary analysis population included 39 
adult healthy volunteers non-dependent, recreational drug users with sedative experience, that 
completed all treatment periods and had at least 1 PD assessment (relevant scales and tests) 
Objectives: To evaluate safety/abuse potential of single oral doses of cenobamate (200 and 400 mg) 
relative to alprazolam (sedative with a known profile of abuse) and placebo. 
Both doses of cenobamate (200 and 400 mg) had similar abuse potential profile and significantly lower 
compared to alprazolam. Primary measure (Drug Liking Emax value) was similar to cenobamate 200 mg 
and placebo. Cenobamate 400 mg differentiate from placebo on Emax value but showed significantly 
decreased peak effects even when compared to the lowest dose of alprazolam. Both doses of 
cenobamate were comparable to placebo on psychomotor performance and on cognitive function. 
Plasma concentrations of cenobamate observed in recreational sedative users were consistent with 
those measured in previous cenobamate clinical studies conducted in healthy subjects.  
Thorough QTc study (YKP3089C020): Phase 1, randomised, DB, PBO/active-controlled, 2-arm parallel 
study, multiple-dose nested crossover design for the control arm, 64 days dosing in 108 adult healthy 
volunteers (102 completed the study; 54 received initial 50 mg/day, increasing 50 mg/week, until 500 
mg/day cenobamate). 
Objectives: To evaluate the effects of therapeutic dose (200 mg/day) and supratherapeutic dose (500 
mg/day) of cenobamate on the baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected, corrected QTc interval for HR 
using Fridericia’s corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
The heart rate effect on cenobamate was small with the largest mean change from baseline heart rate 
(ΔHR) on cenobamate was -2.7 bpm and -2.9 bpm 1 hour after dosing on Days 35 (200 mg) and 63 
(500 mg), respectively. The largest mean placebo-corrected ΔHR (ΔΔHR) on cenobamate was -3.6 
bpm at 12 hours on Day 63.  
The largest mean change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) on cenobamate was seen 0.5 hours after dosing 
on Days 35 and 63, -12.0 and -22.5 msec, respectively. The mean ΔΔQTcF is -10.8 [CI: -13.4, -
8.2] msec for 200 mg once daily and -18.4 [CI: -21.5, -15.2] msec for 500 mg once daily. Nine 
subjects had QTcF ≥450 ms at one or more time points after dosing. 
Regarding cardiac conduction (PR and QRS), the mean change-from-baseline PR (ΔPR) was mildly 
positive on both placebo and cenobamate at all time points on both Days 35 and 63.  The largest mean 
placebo-corrected ΔPR (ΔΔPR) was seen at 1 hour on both days, 4.1 msec (90% CI: 1.2 to 7.1) on Day 
35 and 2.8 msec (90% CI: -0.5 to 6.1) on Day 63. No effect on the QRS was noted with all mean 
ΔΔQRS on cenobamate within ± 1.0 msec. 
Plasma exposures to cenobamate increased proportionally with increasing dose, with Mean (SD) values 
of AUCtau (µg*hr/mL) being 476.07 (119.649) on Day 35 (200 mg QD) and 1270.2 (235.154) on Day 
63 (500 mg QD).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, all analytical methods were well developed, validated and with acceptable performance.  
As cenobamate was never administered intravenous, its oral bioavailability is unknown. However, 
based on the available data, the bioavailability is expected to be high and cenobamate should be 
considered as a BCS class 1 drug, with high permeability and high solubility. Its absorption is very fast 
with a Tmax ranging from 1 to 4 hours post-dose.  
No major food effect was observed after a high-fat high-calorie meal, with bioequivalence in Cmax and 
AUC between fasting and fed conditions. 
The volume of distribution in most of the studies was in the order of 40-50L. Plasma protein binding is 
approximately 60% and independent of the plasma concentration. Whole blood to plasma ratio of 
cenobamate is 0.60. 
The elimination half-life of cenobamate is around 50h, and is mainly eliminated by the urine as 
metabolites, with only a small fraction of the dose (around 7%) appearing in the urine as cenobamate.  
Cenobamate is extensively metabolised to multiple metabolites that are further metabolised and/or 
excreted primarily in urine. Cenobamate is metabolised by both UGT conjugation and CYP oxidation. 
UGT enzymes include UGT2B7 and to a lesser extent UGT2B4, and CYP enzymes include CYP2E1, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.  
No major metabolites (i.e. >10% of total drug-related material) were identified in human plasma. The 
N-glucuronide of cenobamate (M1) was the only circulating metabolite detected in plasma and its 
exposure (AUC) was found to be 1.2% of the parent drug.  
Cenobamate PK seems to be linear across the therapeutic dose range of 100 to 400 mg/day in steady 
state. However, systemic exposures increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses less 
than 100-200 mg/day in single dose. This may be due to a saturation of one of the multiple metabolic 
routes. 
Dedicated clinical study on renal impaired subjects resulted in contradictory results, with an exposure 
increase of 1.5 times for mild and moderate impaired subjects but lack of effect on severe impaired 
subjects. This was further discussed and explained, with simulation using the population PK model, by 
the evaluation of the demographic differences and inter-individual variability. Based on the results, it is 
agreed that a maximum dose in patients with renal impairment at 300 mg/day should be 
recommended. Cenobamate should not be used in patients with end-stage renal disease or patients 
undergoing haemodialysis. 
Systemic exposures of cenobamate were 1.9-fold and 2.3-fold higher in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic 
function after a single cenobamate 200 mg dose. The CHMP agreed that the maximum recommended 
dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment is 200 mg per day. Use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.  
Although statistically significant effects of race were observed in the population PK model, these were 
not clinically relevant, and no dose adjustment based on race/ethnicity is required. Weight has a 
significant effect on cenobamate exposure, and simulations showed that subjects with low weights may 
have ~25% higher exposures and those with high weights may have ~20% lower exposures than 
those with mean weights. The CHMP agreed that it may be clinically relevant. Given that cenobamate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 59/122 
 
 
 
treatment should be initiated with slow titration to recommended dose and clinical response, the CHMP 
agreed that no specific recommendation for patients based on weight is needed when establishing a 
dose. However, dose adjustments may be needed in patients who experience weight changes of ≥30% 
of their initial body weight. 
There seems to be a small but significant effect of age on the cenobamate PK, with a slight increase in 
the exposure in elderly subjects when compared to younger subjects. Considering the reduction of 
hepatic and renal functions with age, this is expected and it is sufficiently described in the SmPC.  
Based on the in vitro data, cenobamate is predicted to cause a number of interactions with medicinal 
products  (see  non-clinical  discussion).  This  was  further  investigated  in  the  pharmacokinetic  study 
(YKP3089C026),  which  showed  that  cenobamate  may  reduce  exposures  of  products  primarily 
metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and  2B6  and  may  increase  exposures  of  products  primarily  metabolised  by 
CYP2C19. 
In addition, several drug-drug interaction studies, as well as population PK analyses, were conducted to 
evaluate  cenobamate  interactions  with  other  antiepileptic  drugs  including  phenytoin,  phenobarbital, 
clobazam,  lamotrigine,  carbamazepine,  valproic  acid,  lacosamide,  levetiracetam  and  oxcarbazepine 
Additional  clinical  studies  also  assessed  the  interactions  of  cenobamate  with  oral  contraceptives,  CYP 
substrates, alcohol, and food. 
None of the effects of ASMs on cenobamate are substantive enough to require specific dose adjustment 
of cenobamate, particularly considering the slow titration allowing for dose adjustments based on 
individual response and possibility for treatment-resistant patients to achieve seizure control.  
Cenobamate increases exposures of phenobarbital and phenytoin and it is agreed that concentrations 
of these ASMs should be monitored during the cenobamate titration. 
Due to a possible accumulation of desmethyl-clobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam, related to 
the induction of CYP3A4 (formation) and the inhibition of CYP2C19 (elimination), a dose decrease of 
clobazam may be required when co-administered with cenobamate. 
Cenobamate reduces exposures of lamotrigine and carbamazepine. In addition, based on additional 
analyses on the double-blind studies data, depending on the individual response, higher dose of 
cenobamate may be required for efficacy when co-administered with lamotrigine. (see clinical 
discussion). 
Cenobamate has no relevant effect on lacosamide, levetiracetam, valproic acid, or oxcarbazepine.  
The relevant information regarding cenobamate interactions with other antiepileptics is correctly 
reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Regarding cenobamate DDI as perpetrator with CYP450 substrates, cenobamate induces the activity of 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and inhibits the activity of CYP2C19. Cenobamate (200 mg/day) reduced plasma 
concentrations of substrates metabolised by CYP2B6 (-23% Cmax and -39% AUC) or CYP3A4 (-61% 
Cmax and -72% AUC) and increased plasma concentrations of substrates metabolised by CYP2C19 
(+107% Cmax and +83% AUC). Considering the potential reduced efficacy of medicines metabolised 
by CYP2B6 or CYP3A4, doses of these medicines may need to be increased when used concomitantly 
with cenobamate. Regarding medicines metabolised by CYP2C19, in view of the potential increase in 
adverse reactions, doses may need to be reduced when used concomitantly with cenobamate. 
Regarding cenobamate DDI as perpetrator with UGT substrates, cenobamate does not appear to 
increase bilirubin (substrate of UGT1A1). Also, co-administration of cenobamate with carbamazepine or 
lamotrigine (metabolised by UGT2B7) does not increase exposures of either ASM. Clinical data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 60/122 
 
 
 
therefore suggest that cenobamate inhibition of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 does not have a clinically 
relevant effect. 
Regarding DDI effects on transporters, clinical bilirubin levels (a surrogate probe for OATP1B1-
mediated DDIs) suggest that OATP1B1 inhibition does not have a significant impact. An analysis of the 
adverse events data for patients taken cenobamate and metformim (MATE1 and MATE2K substrate) 
showed that there were no clinically relevant changes. In vitro data have shown that cenobamate 
inhibits OAT3, a transporter predominantly involved in the elimination of several medicinal products, 
and concomitant administration may therefore result in higher exposures of these medicinal products. 
Interaction with oral contraceptives was investigated in a dedicated DDI study and a CYP interaction 
study. Data from the CYP interaction study showed that the cenobamate exert a dose-dependent 
induction of CYP3A4 with an anticipated reduction of estradiol exposure and risk of decreased efficacy 
of oral contraceptives. Based on this data, it is recommended that women of reproductive potential 
concomitantly using oral contraceptives should use an additional or alternative non-hormonal birth 
control. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The primary PD of cenobamate is based on the clinical data from 2 clinical phase 2 studies (C013 and 
C017) and a small Proof of Principle study on intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) induced photo-
paroxysmal EEG response.  
The secondary PD is based in the clinical data from the clinical studies on abuse potential/liability and 
QTc interval. The abuse potential study showed there was no significant associated differences in 
relevant PD endpoints, revealing that both doses of cenobamate (200 and 400 mg) were liked 
significantly less than alprazolam by the recreational sedative users, and neither were associated with 
impaired effects on psychomotor performance or cognitive function.  
The clinical results from the QTc study in healthy volunteers revealed a dose-dependent shortening of 
the QTcF interval. The mean ΔΔQTcF is -10.8 [CI: -13.4, -8.2] msec for 200 mg once daily and -
18.4 [CI: -21.5, -15.2] msec for 500 mg once daily (1.25 times the maximum recommended dosage). 
Reductions of the QTc interval below 340 msec were not observed. The CHMP agree that information 
from the QT study results and the observed shortening of the QTcF interval are correctly reflected in 
section 5.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC (see also clinical safety discussion).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP agrees that the available pharmacology data are acceptable.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose-response was assessed through an exposure-response model built with data from the clinical 
studies C013 (with 200mg dose) and C017 (with 100, 200 and 400 mg doses). 
This model was used to simulate expected daily seizure count at daily doses ≤600 mg while assuming 
a patient population similar to that in studies C013 and C017 and a titration scheme similar to that of 
study C021. Data indicate that the majority of patients will show a therapeutic effect at daily doses up 
to 200 mg, but additional patients will likely benefit from doses up to 400 mg/day.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 61/122 
 
 
 
The simulated fraction of patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency increased with doses up to 
400 mg/day (0.42 at 100 mg/day, 0.52 at 200 mg/day, and 0.60 at 400 mg/day). Doubling the dose 
from 100 to 200 mg/day or 200 to 400 mg/day results in ~8-10% increase in the fraction of patients 
with ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. 
The simulated fraction of seizure-free patients increased with doses up to 400 mg/day (0.13 at 100 
mg/day, 0.20 at 200 mg/day, and 0.28 at 400 mg/day). Doubling the dose from 100 to 200 mg/day or 
200 to 400 mg/day results in a ~7-8% increase in seizure-free patients.

Optional Open-Label Extension 
Methods 
This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effective dose range 
and safety of cenobamate as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of focal onset seizures. A total of 
400 patients were planned to be randomised (1:1:1:1) to target doses of cenobamate 100, 200, or 
400 mg or placebo.  A sample size of 100 patients per treatment group was estimated to provide a 
statistical power of 80% to detect a difference of 16% in percent reduction in seizure frequency 
between a cenobamate dose group and placebo, at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a 
standard deviation of 40% using an independent samples t test.

B), focal unaware (Type C), or secondarily generalised (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) (Type D) 
seizures in the double-blind treatment period.

• 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate defined as a ≥50% reduction from 
baseline in the seizure frequency during the double-blind treatment period.  
Additional secondary efficacy Assessments: 
•  Higher response rates (≥75%, ≥90%, and 100%) of focal aware seizures, focal 
unaware seizures or secondarily generalised (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) seizures 
seizures during the double-blind treatment period and during the maintenance 
compared with the baseline. 
•  Percentage change from baseline in seizure frequency (average monthly seizure rate 
per 28 days) by seizure subtypes. 
•  Seizure rate over time. 
•  Global Impression of Change (CGIC) recorded by the physician at Visit 9 or Early 
Termination. 
•  Quality of Life in Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P) completed by the subject at Visit 
3 and Visit 9 or Early Termination. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: 
Trough ASM concentrations (oxcarbazepine, topiramate, carbamazepine [CBZ], valproate, lamotrigine, 
lacosamide and levetiracetam only) during the baseline pre-treatment period were compared to those 
during the treatment period in subjects randomised to 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or 400 mg/day 
cenobamate or placebo to assess possible drug interactions. 
Cenobamate plasma concentrations were obtained under steady-state conditions at Visits 7 and 8. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomisation was performed centrally using an IWRS. Randomisation codes were based on a block 
randomisation within study country. Subjects were assigned with equal chance to 1 of the 4 treatment 
groups based on a randomisation schedule prepared by the designated statistician.  
Treatment assignments remained blinded to the subject and all study personnel until final database 
lock. Selected individuals from the sponsor and/or designee and at CRO could be unblinded to the 
study treatments on a need-to-know basis as described in CRO’s standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) on blinding and unblinding. In the event of an emergency if unblinding was necessary, 
investigators could have performed emergency unblinding using the IWRS immediately, without prior 
contact to the study’s medical monitor, if they felt it was medically necessary and that knowledge of 
the treatment assignment was essential for the patient’s care. If such an emergency unblinding was 
necessary, investigators promptly documented and explained to the medical monitor or sponsor of the 
premature unblinding of the investigational product 
Statistical methods 
Hypothesis and Multiplicity 
This was a superiority study.  
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint was to compare each of the cenobamate dosage 
groups with the placebo group. Due to multiple treatment comparisons, a step-down procedure was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 66/122 
 
 
 
 
used to ensure the overall type I error rate is controlled at the 5% level. Each of the cenobamate 
dosage groups was compared with the placebo group according to the following hierarchy: 1. 200-mg 
dosage group versus placebo group; 2. 400-mg dosage group versus placebo group; 3. 100-mg 
dosage group versus placebo group 
The 200-mg dosage group was compared with the placebo group at a 2-sided 0.05 level as the first 
step. If no statistically significant difference was detected between the 200-mg dosage group and the 
placebo group, the procedure would be stopped and it would be concluded that none of the 
cenobamate dosages are efficacious. If a statistically significant difference was detected between the 
200-mg dosage group and the placebo group in favor of the 200-mg dosage group, the procedure 
would proceed to the next step to compare the 400-mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2-
sided 0.05 level. If a statistically significant difference was detected between the 400-mg dosage group 
and the placebo group in favor of the 400-mg dosage group, the procedure would proceed to the next 
step to compare the 100-mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2-sided 0.05 level.  
Study Populations 
• 
• 
Enrolled  subjects:  All  subjects  who  gave  informed  consent  to  participate  in  the  study  were 
considered enrolled subjects. 
Intention-to-treat (ITT) subjects: All randomised subjects were considered ITT subjects. 
•  Modified  ITT  (MITT)  subjects:  All  randomised  subjects  who  had  taken  at  least  1  dose  of 
cenobamate (or placebo) and had any postbaseline seizure data were considered MITT subjects. 
•  MITT subjects in maintenance phase (MITT-M): All randomised subjects who had completed the 
titration phase and had taken at least 1 dose of cenobamate (or placebo) in the maintenance 
phase and had any maintenance phase seizure data were considered MITT-M subjects. 
•  MITT subjects who completed maintenance phase (MITT-M completer): All randomised subjects 
who had completed the titration phase and completed the maintenance phase were considered 
MITT-M completer subjects. 
• 
Per protocol (PP) population: All randomised subjects who had no major protocol violations and 
had at least 80% drug compliance were considered PP subjects. 
•  Safety evaluable (SE) subjects: All ITT subjects were also considered SE subjects (all randomised 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication). 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint in the countries of Europe, Australia, New 
Zealand, and South Africa was based on the MITT-M population. The testing strategy for the endpoint 
(responder rate) was to compare each of the cenobamate dosage groups with the placebo group. The 
responder rate was defined as a ≥50% reduction during the maintenance phase of the double-blind 
period in the seizure frequency from baseline. 
Baseline phase seizure frequency was defined as the average monthly seizure rate per 28 days of all 
Type B, Type C, and Type D seizures. Maintenance phase seizure frequency rate was defined in a 
similar manner, accounting for seizures recorded during maintenance phase of the double-blind 
treatment period only. The data were summarised using count and percentage of subjects achieving at 
least a 50% response to treatment, the responder rate. The responder data were analyzed using a chi-
square test. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 67/122 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the responder rate defined as a ≥ 50% reduction during the 
maintenance phase of the double-blind period in the seizure frequency from baseline during the first 6 
weeks of the maintenance phase, and in the last 6 weeks of the maintenance phase. An additional 
sensitivity analysis accounted for subjects who dropped out during the titration phase; these subjects’ 
maintenance phase data were imputed using their available titration data. 
Secondary endpoint analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from the pretreatment baseline phase in 
seizure frequency (average monthly seizure rate per 28 days) of all simple focal motor, complex focal, 
or secondarily generalised seizures compared with the seizure frequency in the maintenance phase of 
the double-blind treatment period and was based on the MITT-M analysis population. 
An ANCOVA model was fit to the ranked values of the change in seizure frequency during the 
maintenance phase. The ANCOVA included terms for ranked baseline seizure rate and randomised 
treatment group. Ties were handled using the default option in SAS. The efficacy analysis used a 
nonparametric approach. Because of this, effect sizes were not estimated and tested directly, as 
testing was made on the rank of the change in seizure frequency. However, summary tables for the 
actual (not the ranked) changes in seizure frequency were presented. 
Sensitivity analyses for the secondary efficacy endpoint 
Percentage change from the pretreatment baseline phase in seizure frequency: a) compared with the 
first 6 weeks of the maintenance phase of the double blind period; b) compared with the last 6 weeks 
of the maintenance phase of the double blind period; c) compared with the seizure frequency in the 
maintenance phase of the double blind period; for subjects who discontinued during titration phase of 
the double-blind period their titration phase seizure rate will be used in the analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: 
Descriptive statistics were performed on the plasma concentrations of the concomitant ASMs obtained 
during steady-state concomitant treatment (Visits 7 and 8) and those at baseline (Visit 3) to assess 
the effect of cenobamate on these ASMs. Descriptive statistics were performed on the plasma 
concentrations of the cenobamate obtained during steady-state treatment (Visits 7 and 8). 
Handling of missing data  
For the primary endpoint (≥50% responder rate), days with missing data were assumed to have the 
same seizure rate as days with non-missing data. To assess the effect of other potential seizure rate 
patterns and missing data during the maintenance phase on this efficacy endpoint analysis, several 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. These sensitivity analyses involved observed data from (1) the 
first 6 weeks of the maintenance phase and (2) the last 6 weeks of the maintenance phase. 
The definition of the primary efficacy endpoint in the US and ROW (secondary endpoint in Europe) 
implicitly accounted for missing data in that it was identical to a definition in which days with missing 
data were assumed to have the same seizure rate as days with non-missing data.

Sensitivity Analyses 
During the assessment, the applicant was asked to perform a more conservative estimation of the 
treatment effect, based on the full MITT dataset and with methods for handling missing data that do 
not imply that do not assume continuing treatment effect such as copy increment from refence and 
jump to reference. 
Although to a lesser extent, and only clinically significant for the 200 and 400 mg treatment arms, these 
analyses yielded results within the same magnitude of effect. 
This  indicates  with  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence  that  the  population  that  did  not  reach  the 
maintenance period for any reason, even if not responding well to cenobamate, would not significantly 
impact on the final results, accounting for both seizure counts: of the maintenance period only and of 
the entire DB period.

Hypothesis 
Superiority vs placebo with step-down procedure testing:  The 200 mg dosage group 
was compared with the placebo group at a 2-sided 0.05 level as the 
first step. If no statistically significant difference was detected between the 200 mg 
dosage group and the placebo group, the procedure was stopped, and it was 
concluded that none of the cenobamate dosages were efficacious. If a statistically 
significant difference was detected between the 200 mg dosage group and the 
placebo group in favour of the 200 mg dosage group, the procedure proceeded to 
the next step to compare the 400 mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2-
sided 0.05 level. If a statistically significant difference was detected between the 400 
mg dosage group and the placebo group in favour of the 400 mg dosage group, the 
procedure proceeded to the next step to compare the 100 mg dosage group with the 
placebo group at a 2-sided 0.05 level.

The EU primary efficacy endpoint was based on the MITT-M population for the 12-
week maintenance period. Data were analysed by a Chi-square test.  
A step-down procedure was used to ensure the type I error rate due to multiple 
treatment comparisons was controlled at the 5% level. 
The study was planned and powered based on the primary efficacy endpoint defined 
for the US and ROW, i.e. percent change from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 
days in the DB period. This analysis was performed based on the ITT for the DB 
period. The primary efficacy analysis used a non-parametric (ranked) analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms for ranked baseline seizure rate and 
treatment.

The EU secondary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline in seizure 
frequency per 28 days in the 12-week maintenance phase, based on the ITT for the 
maintenance phase. The analysis model was the same as defined for the US primary 
endpoint.  
Responder rates defined by higher cut-offs (patients with ≥75%, ≥90%, or 100% 
reduction in seizure frequency during the 12-week maintenance phase based on the 
ITT of the maintenance period) were analysed using Fisher’s exact test without the 
step-down procedure for testing dose levels vs placebo. 
Median percentage change for focal seizure subtypes (including Type B focal aware 
seizure), Type C (focal unaware seizure), and Type D (secondarily generalised, focal 
to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure) was summarised using descriptive statistics. 
Responder rates are also presented descriptively by subgroups of Concomitant ASM.

Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of cenobamate 200 mg in reducing seizure frequency in 
patients with focal onset seizures (focal seizures) not fully controlled despite treatment with 1 to 3 
concomitant ASMs. 
Methods: Adult patients were eligible if they had a history of epilepsy for at least 2 years; a diagnosis 
of treatment resistant focal epilepsy according to ILAE criteria; at least 3 focal aware onset seizures or 
(focal unaware) or secondarily generalised (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) seizures per month with no 
consecutive 21-day seizure-free period. Patients had to be on stable doses of 1-3 ASMs for at least 12 
weeks before randomisation.  
Dose reductions could occur at any visit and during any of the study periods (i.e. titration, 
maintenance, or OLE). Patients who had their dose increased in a scheduled titration step and 
subsequently failed to meet tolerability criteria had to have their dose decreased. Patients who were 
unable to tolerate 50 mg were to discontinue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Dose 
increases after prior dose reductions were not allowed. 
Efficacy assessments were based on the seizure diary, at weekly intervals during the titration period 
and 2-weekly intervals during the maintenance phase. ASM use was recorded at 2-weekly intervals 
during the titration period and after the second and sixth week of the maintenance phase. Samples 
were taken to measure cenobamate and ASM levels.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days 
from baseline during the treatment period; the secondary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate 
(defined as patients with a reduction of ≥50% in seizure frequency in the treatment period).  
Results: A total of 222 patients were randomised into the study (200 mg/day: n=113; placebo: 
n=109). Of these, equal proportions (200 mg/day: 90.3%; placebo: 90.8%) completed the DB period; 
the most frequent reasons for non-completion were withdrawal by the patient (4.4% vs 3.7%) and AEs 
(3.5% vs 3.7%). Equal proportions of patients (67.3% vs 67.0%) entered the OLE period.

About half of the randomised patients were female (200 mg/day: 51.3%; placebo: 46.8%). Mean (SD) 
age was 36.9 years. About half of the patients were White/Caucasian (200 mg/day: 50.4%, placebo: 
53.2%), and Asians accounted for the second-largest race group (43.4% vs 41.3%). 
The median number of seizures per 28 days at baseline was 7.5 in the cenobamate 200 mg group and 
5.5 in the placebo group. The median time since epilepsy diagnosis was 239 vs 253 months, equivalent 
to about 23 years in either group. About half of patients (46.9% vs 48.1%) had 2 baseline ASMs, and 
26.3% vs 41.7% had more than 2 ASMs. Less than 20% of patients in either arm had only one 
baseline ASM. 
In the cenobamate 200 mg group, median seizure frequency decreased from 7.5 during the baseline 
period to 3.8 during the DB period, the median reduction was 55.6%. In the placebo group, the 
median seizure frequency decreased from 5.5 during the baseline period to 5.0 during the DB period (-
21.5%). The difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001).  
Considering only the maintenance phase, median seizure frequency per 28 days decreased in the 
cenobamate 200 mg group from 7.6 at baseline to 2.8 (-45.%) and in the placebo group from 5.5 at 
baseline to 4.6 (-15.9%) (p<0.0001).  
The responder rate in the DB period was statistically significantly (p<0.0001) higher in the cenobamate 
200 mg group (50.4%) than in the placebo group (22.2%).  
Overall, 8.8% of patients receiving cenobamate 200 mg reached freedom from seizures in the DB 
period, vs 0.9% of placebo patients. Considering only the maintenance phase, 28.3% of patients in the 
cenobamate group became seizure free, vs 8.8% of patients receiving placebo. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two double-blind studies, C013 and C017, were provided in this submission. 
The study C017 is considered as main clinical study. Its design was adequate for a dose finding phase 
2 study. Since it was upgraded to a pivotal study, there was some discussions to ensure that it fulfilled 
the relevant guidelines, including the requirements of the ‘Points to consider on application with one 
pivotal study’ (CPMP/EWP/2330/99). In particular, it was noted that, although the number of missing 
data increases significantly with the dose (23% for 400 mg arm, 9.5% for 100 mg and 15-5% for 200 
mg as compared to 8.5% for placebo) the ITT results do not significantly differ from M-ITT results 
presented with the initial submission. Further additional analyses, including composite strategy 
estimand considering those with less than 50% improvement and all missed evaluations as a non-
responder, were also provided. The CHMP agreed that these additional analyses were satisfactory and 
confirmed the magnitude of treatment benefit and robustness of results.  
In the original C017 protocol, the initial titration to the maintenance dose was rapid, with increments 
of 100 mg. This led to a high discontinuation rate (10.5%) due to adverse events (see also clinical 
safety discussion). The titration was consequently revised to a slower titration (1st protocol 
amendment). The CHMP agreed that this correction occurred early in the study and that the 
consequences of the quick titration do not seem to impact the results.  
The study C017 included mostly EU patients (57.6%). A geographical analysis of data was performed 
and showed no significant differences which confirmed the robustness of results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 90/122 
 
 
 
Both studies enrolled a significantly diseased population, many with drug-resistant epilepsy and 
multiple treatment failures. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate. It is however noted that 
patients older than 65 years of age were only included in Study C017 with 10 patients ≥65 years of 
age (9 in the maintenance phase population). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Based on the percentage of responders, the magnitude of the clinical effect was clear: 56.1% of 
subjects treated with cenobamate 200 mg and 64.2% with cenobamate 400 mg were responders 
(having at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency) in comparison to 25.5% with placebo. This means 
that the therapeutic effect on the proposed dose is > 25% of seizure frequency reduction. This is 
clinically relevant, particularly in an uncontrolled population with most of them fulfilling the criteria for 
drug-resistant epilepsy. The lower 100mg dose also had a slight effect. 
In addition, the CHMP noted that 11.2% of subjects treated with cenobamate 200 mg and 21.1% with 
cenobamate 400 mg showed 100% response (i.e. were seizure free) in comparison with 1.0% with 
placebo. This 100% response effect rarely occurs with other antiepileptic drugs in this population 
(uncontrolled patients who have failed a median of 4 ASMs in the past). 
The analyses of the entire double-blind period, including up titration, show the same trend (57.8% 
with cenobamate 200mg, 60.4% with 400mg vs. 21.7% with placebo with ≥50% reduction in seizure 
frequency) indicating that the clinical effect starts early during titration. 
The effect of cenobamate over the different types of seizures (focal aware, focal unaware and 
secondarily generalised, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) is also clinically relevant: all 3 
cenobamate treatment groups (100mg, 200mg and 400mg/day) significantly reduced focal aware 
seizure frequency during the double-blind treatment period. The 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day 
treatment groups significantly reduced the focal unaware seizures and secondarily generalised, focal to 
bilateral tonic-clonic seizures per 28 days during the double-blind treatment period.  
There seemed to be a less significant effect on patients treated with benzodiazepines(clobazam) and 
lamotrigine, requiring higher doses of cenobamate to achieve similar 50% reduction responses.  An 
overall decreased effect when cenobamate was added to lamotrigine was observed. Whilst it could not 
be fully clarified, the CHMP agrees with the SmPC recommendation that dose of cenobamate may need 
to be increased depending on individual response when co-administered with lamotrigine. 
No clinically relevant quality of life changes were demonstrated. In the study C017, the measurement 
of the quality of life with QOLIE-31-P was limited to only English-speaking countries and this decreased 
the sample considerably (n=133 at baseline compared to n=434 at baseline in MITT).  
The results of the supportive study C013 align with those of the main study C017 and support the 
proposed target dose.  
It was noted that the clinical studies included only a small number of patients >65 years of age (10 
patients in study C017) and it was therefore not possible to determine whether they responded 
differently from younger patients. 
Dose-response relationship 
A clear dose-response relationship was observed between doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg of 
cenobamate and magnitude of response. 
In order to support the target dose of 200 mg/day (maximum of 400 mg/day), an exposure-response 
relationship defined by a population PD model describing the relationship between AUC and seizure

Page 91/122 
 
 
 
count was presented (SK16008). The model-based results supports a continued increment in efficacy 
up to the maximum therapeutic dose of 400 mg/day, based on the decrease in weekly seizure count 
that was evident with increasing doses (100 to 600 mg/day) and the simulated fraction of patients with 
more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These data are in line with the clinical efficacy data 
from Study C017 study, which also showed that median seizure frequency was significantly lower for 
cenobamate 200 mg (-56.5%) and 400 mg (-63%), compared to placebo. Overall, the totality of the 
data supports that a notable number of patients achieve key clinical improvement and seizure freedom 
at doses up to 200 mg/day. Modal analyses of dose by study support the need for doses higher than 
200 mg/day in some patients for appropriate long-term effectiveness. The information is correctly 
reflected in the agreed posology recommendation (section 4.1 of the SmPC). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of cenobamate, in the claimed indication, is supported by 2 randomised, double-blind 
studies (main study C17 and supportive study C013). In both studies, cenobamate treatment was 
associated with a reduction of seizures frequency. The CHMP agreed that the available data support 
the efficacy of the use of cenobamate as adjunctive treatment of focal onset seizures in adult patients 
with epilepsy who have not been adequately controlled despite a history of treatment with at least 2 
ASMs. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2564 subjects were exposed to cenobamate in the 26 clinical studies. 
Considering the significant differences between study designs and exposures to cenobamate and in 
order to have a comprehensive review of cenobamate safety, 5 analysis populations for 
patients/subjects who received at least one dose of cenobamate were established.  These populations 
took into consideration the type of study they were selected from: DB Pool, LT OLE Pool, Phase 2/3 
Pool, C021, and Phase 1 Pool. Additionally, a separate analysis was done for each of the studies C013 
and C017.

Severity of adverse events 
Among subjects treated with cenobamate, 45 (39.8%) subjects had mild TEAEs, 39 (34.5%) subjects 
had moderate TEAEs, and 2 (1.8%) subjects had severe TEAEs. Among placebo treated subjects, 36

(33.0%) subjects had mild TEAEs, 26 (23.9%) subjects had moderate TEAEs, and 7 (6.4%) subjects 
had severe TEAEs. 
The severe TEAEs in the cenobamate 200 mg group were urinary tract infection (150 mg) and tooth 
extraction (100 mg). In the placebo group, severe events were status epilepticus, convulsions, 
dizziness, pyrexia, vomiting, GERD, diplopia, and dizziness. 
DB Pool  
The median duration of exposure to cenobamate was 17.86 weeks, and 85.5% of patients received 
cenobamate for ≥12 weeks. Overall exposure to cenobamate totalled 127.8 person- years. Most 
patients experienced an AE, with a larger proportion of the cenobamate group experiencing treatment-
related AEs (64.5% vs. 44.0% receiving placebo). The most common AEs in patients receiving 
cenobamate were somnolence (24.7% vs. 10.2% receiving placebo), dizziness (23.3% vs. 15.7%), 
fatigue (16.1% vs. 7.4%), and headache (11.3% vs. 9.3%) with most events occurred during the 
titration phase.   
Most AEs were either mild or moderate (36.2% and 25.0%) in severity; the frequency of moderate AEs 
increased with cenobamate dose. The only severe AEs reported in >1% of patients receiving 
cenobamate were somnolence (2.0% vs. 0%) and dizziness (1.8% vs. 1.9% in placebo). The 
frequency of severe AEs increased with dose for vertigo, fatigue, somnolence, dysarthria and 
headache. 64.5% of patients receiving cenobamate experienced at least 1 AE that was considered 
related to the study drug by the investigator. 
Vertigo, nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, gait disturbance, somnolence, dizziness, balance 
disorder, and ataxia incidence generally increased with cenobamate dose. 
AEs that occurred at a notably higher frequency (≥5%) across all cenobamate dose groups compared 
with placebo included diplopia, fatigue and somnolence. 
The most common treatment-related AEs were somnolence (23.8% of patients vs. 9.3% in the placebo 
group), dizziness (21.0% vs. 13.4%) and fatigue (15.6% vs. 7.4%) which were also dose dependent. 
A larger proportion of patients receiving cenobamate experienced an AE that led to study drug 
discontinuation (13.1% vs. 4.2% in the placebo group), such as ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, vertigo, 
and nystagmus, with a dose dependency. 
No deaths were reported in the DB. 
A comparable proportion of patients receiving cenobamate and placebo experienced SAEs and severe 
AEs and at least 1 study drug-related SAE. 
A larger proportion of patients receiving cenobamate underwent dose reduction due to an AE (18.1% 
vs. 6.5% in the placebo group), also related to higher cenobamate exposure doses. The most frequent 
AEs that led to study drug dose reduction were dizziness, somnolence and diplopia. 
The cenobamate 400 mg group had a slightly higher proportion of patients with severe AEs and AEs 
that led to study drug or study discontinuation.

Impact of titration schemes on adverse event profile.  
Different titration schemes were used in the clinical studies: 
- Study C013: a slow titration rate was used (starting daily dose of 50 mg/day cenobamate or placebo 
with increases by 50 mg/day increments every 2 weeks, based on tolerability of treatment, to a 
cenobamate target dose of 200 mg/day over a 6-week titration phase - treatment continued for a 
subsequent 6-week maintenance phase). 
- Study C017: a more rapid titration schedule was used (starting dose of 100 mg/day, with a weekly 
increase of 100 mg/day until the target dose was reached). Due to early issues with tolerability, after 
46 patients (10.5%) were treated under the initial rapid titration scheme, the titration schedule was 
adapted:  the starting dose became 50 mg/day, and the titration rate was 50 mg/day per week until a 
daily dose of 200 mg/day was reached, with subsequent 100-mg/day-increments for patients with a 
target dose of 400 mg/day).  
- Study C021: a slower titration schedule was used (starting dose of 12.5 mg/day, increased to 25 
mg/day after 2 weeks and then 50 mg day after 2 weeks. Patients were then up titrated by 50 mg/day 
every 2 weeks to a target of 200 mg/day and could increase to a maximum dose of 400 mg/day).

Figure 38: Occurrence of rash/hypersensitivity and DRESS in patients/subjects exposed to 
multiple doses of cenobamate in clinical studies 
All 3 DRESS cases occurred in studies that had rapid titration to target dose.  
Rash/hypersensitivity reactions were associated with higher initial doses and/or dosing intervals of 
cenobamate with no differences among placebo arms of different studies. 
Severity of AEs, percentage of AEs leading to discontinuation, and SAEs were higher for subjects on 
cenobamate titrated weekly compared to those titrated every other week in the DB Pool.  
The AEs that were notably more frequent in patients titrated weekly were fatigue and diplopia (also 
more frequent in the cenobamate arm and showing a dose-dependent increase in frequency). 
Vital signs and physical findings: 
Vital signs parameters (respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
and body temperature) were evaluated and data across studies have shown no noteworthy trends over 
time or meaningful differences between treatment groups. There were also no clinically relevant 
changes in body weight.   
QT shortening  
In the DB Pool and OLE Pool, there were no relevant changes in mean ECG parameters from baseline, 
and no relevant differences between treatment groups. Additionally, there was no relevant difference 
in the occurrence of cardiac events seen between groups. 
- DB Pool: some patients had changes in QTcF from baseline of >30 ms, but none had changes of >60 
ms. Palpitations were the most reported cardiac AE.  
- study C017: several patients had QTcF values of <360 ms, but none had values of <340 ms. No 
patient had QTcF values of >500 ms, and none had QTcF changes from baseline of >60 ms. Cardiac 
disorder AEs were seen in some patients (bradycardia and sinus bradycardia in 1 patient each receiving 
cenobamate 200 mg; palpitations in both patients receiving cenobamate 400 mg; and sinus 
bradycardia and tachycardia in 1 patient each receiving placebo) 
- study C013: Several patients had QTcF values <360 ms, but none had values <340 ms. No patient 
had QTcF values of >500 ms, and none had QTcF changes from baseline of >60 ms. Cardiac disorder 
AEs were reported for 3 cenobamate patients (2.7%) and 2 placebo patients (1.8%). 
- OLE Pool: there were no patients with QTcF >500 ms in the OLE periods of the pivotal studies. One 
patient had a reported change from baseline QTcF of >60 ms in the cenobamate DB to OLE group at 
12 months. Some patients had clinically significant abnormal ECGs but no trend was found. Cardiac 
disorder AEs occurred in 3.6% of patients overall, including 3.2% of patients taking cenobamate and 
4.3% of patients taking placebo in the preceding DB period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021

- C021: there were slight decreases in mean HR and in QTcF by 12 and 24 months after the start of 
treatment in Study C021. There were no relevant differences in HR between groups. For QTcF, changes 
appeared most pronounced in the cenobamate + phenytoin group at 24 months. Cardiac disorder AEs 
occurred in 26 patients overall (1.9%). With the exception of 1 patient (1.2%) who received 
cenobamate with phenytoin (who had congestive cardiac failure), all patients with cardiac disorder AEs 
received cenobamate with other ASMs. 
In the cenobamate double-blind and long-term open label study subjects with cardiac past medical 
history were included however those with severe disease were excluded. Nevertheless 5.7% and 5.9% 
of cenobamate treated subjects had a prior medical history of cardiac disorders in the DB pool and in 
study C021 respectively. Over 90% of patients with cardiac history were able to complete the double-
blind studies. The vast majority of patients remain in the study at the time of data cut-off (82.9%). Of 
the patients who discontinued, only 3 discontinued due to adverse events (“rash maculopapular,” 
“fatigue” and “psychosis and suicide attempt.”).  
The incidence of subjects with cardiac disorder TEAEs across the cenobamate and placebo groups was 
comparable.  
In long-term open label studies, 3 cases of cardiovascular AEs with an outcome of death occurred in 
subjects taking cenobamate for at least 1 year and 11 months. Additionally, cardiac disorder SAEs 
occurred in 2 elderly subjects in long-term open label studies after at least 6 months of treatment.  
Overdose, drug abuse and dependence, withdrawal 
There were no intentional cases of cenobamate overdose. There was 7 cases of overdose or 
medication error reported as AEs in Phase 2/3 studies including 1 intentional overdose but related to 
other (unknown) medications and not cenobamate.  
There were no reports of misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence. Some patients had potentially 
abuse-related AE like somnolence, dizziness and fatigue and most mild or moderate in severity. The 
rare cases of severe potentially abuse-related AE were mostly dizziness.  
a)  In  the  abuse/dependency  study  (Study  YKP3089C024),  alprazolam  was  selected  as  the 
comparator due to the potential for sedative effects seen with cenobamate and there were 
also  no  reports  of  misuse,  abuse,  diversion,  or  dependence.  Somnolence  was  the  most 
common potentially abuse-related AE, with the incidence increasing with cenobamate dose; 
however, the incidence was >2-fold lower than reported for both alprazolam doses. Euphoric 
mood was reported at a similar incidence following administration of both alprazolam doses 
and cenobamate 400 mg. There was however no reports of euphoric mood with cenobamate 
200 mg. Most AEs were mild in severity and considered related to the study drug. 
b)  Potentially  abuse-related  TEAEs  in  single-dose,  open-label  or  double-blind  studies  and 
multiple-dose,  double-blind  in  healthy  subjects  showed  no  reports  of  misuse,  abuse, 
diversion  or  dependence.  No  potentially  abuse-related  AEs  were  reported  following  single 
dose administration of cenobamate alone at doses ≤300 mg. Mild or moderate somnolence 
was reported following administration of cenobamate 750 mg (4 of 7 subjects, 57.1%) 
c)  There  were  no  reports  of  misuse,  abuse,  diversion  or  dependence  among  subjects  with 
hepatic or renal impairment (Studies YKP3089C027 and YKP3089C028). 
The overall incidence of euphoria in the Phase 2/3 pool was very low (0.3%) and were not dose 
related.  
Adverse events of special interest, including events of suicidal nature, selected adverse skin 
reactions, and DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), were evaluated.

Suicidal  behaviour/ideation/attempt:  There  were  two  cases  of  completed  suicide  in  the  clinical  trial 
database, the first patient (Study C013 OLE) after 132 days of cenobamate treatment and the second 
patient  (Study  C017  OLE)  after  3.8 years  of  treatment.  None  of  the  two  events  were  considered  as 
causality related.  
In Study C013, 9.7 % of subjects in the cenobamate group and 8.3% in the placebo group had history 
of a suicide related event while in study C017, 4.7 to 7.7% of subjects in the cenobamate groups and 
9.4% of subjects in the placebo group had such suicide related event prior histories. No increased rate 
of suicide-related AEs or reports of suicidal ideation or behaviours in C-SSRS was seen in the cenobamate 
treated patients compared to placebo. 
In the long-term open label studies (Studies C017, C013, and C021), 37 patients reported 41 events 
that were considered of suicidal nature. 
Since the data cut-off date for the MAA submission (July 1, 2019), there have been 6 additional TEAEs 
of suicidal behaviour and ideation. Two cases were assessed as related to treatment. The dose was not 
changed in any of the 6 cases and resolved in all but one case. 
Skin reactions: In the DB Pool, the overall proportions of patients experiencing skin reactions and those 
leading to discontinuation were comparable for patients receiving cenobamate and placebo. There was 
no overall increase with dose. In the Phase 2/3 Pool and Phase 1 Pool, overall, the most frequent skin 
reactions event that led to discontinuation were rash, contact dermatitis, and pruritis.  There were no 
Grade 5 skin reactions and no reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN). No increase in skin reaction TEAEs incidence was observed in relation to the duration of treatment.  
DRESS: DRESS was reported in 3 subjects (1 patient with epilepsy and 2 healthy volunteers; 1 in phase 
2/3 and 2 in phase 1 studies; 1 fatal outcome). All cases occurred in studies with rapid weekly titration 
scheduled.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study C017  
Most SAEs were reported under the nervous system disorders SOC. Serious TEAEs were reported for 
10 (9.3%), 4 (3.6%), 8 (7.2%), and 6 (5.6%) subjects in the 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, 400 mg/day, 
and placebo treatment groups, respectively, during the double-blind treatment period. The most 
commonly reported SAE was seizure, which was reported in 4 subjects overall. No deaths occurred 
during the study. 
Study C013 
There was a total of 7 subjects with SAEs during the double-blind treatment period (4 with placebo, 2 
with cenobamate, and 1 just after the end of the taper from cenobamate had status epilepticus). Of 
the 2 cenobamate subjects, 1 experienced a drug hypersensitivity and the other was admitted for a 
urinary tract infection that was considered unrelated to study treatment. Of the 4 placebo subjects, 2

had status epilepticus and the other had a major seizure attack. No deaths occurred during the DB 
treatment period. 
Study C021  
Overall 14.2% of patients experienced at least 1 SAE, with the proportions being comparable across 
treatment groups. Overall 3.1% of patients receiving experienced at least 1 treatment related SAE, 
with the proportions being comparable across treatment groups. The most common treatment-related 
SAEs were ataxia (0.4%), dizziness (0.3%), and seizure, somnolence and rash (each 0.2%). 
Seven patients in Study C021 experienced an AE that resulted in death (with events comprising 
sudden death, sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, subdural haematoma, traumatic intracranial 
haemorrhage, laryngospasm). None of the deaths were considered related to the study medication. 
Phase 1 Pool  
Seven subjects (1.1%) experienced at least 1 SAE, with events by preferred term experienced by ≥2 
subjects comprising DRESS and gunshot wound. One subject had a treatment-emergent AEs that led 
to death in Phase 1 study population, with the event comprising eosinophilic myocarditis that was 
associated with DRESS and considered possibly related to the study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
Study C017 
Haematology 
There were no remarkable median changes from baseline observed for any treatment group. However 
median change from baseline values for haemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets tended to 
shift downwards at Visits 6 and 9 in the cenobamate treatment groups compared with placebo. Two 
TEAEs associated with haematology results were reported during the double-blind treatment period: 
anaemia (1 subject; 400 mg/day treatment group) and leukopenia (1 subject; 400 mg/day treatment 
group). Neither of the events was serious, nor did they lead to treatment discontinuation.  
Clinical Chemistry 
Clinical chemistry parameters were generally similar across treatment groups at baseline. There were 
no remarkable changes from baseline observed for any treatment group. However median values for 
ALT and alkaline phosphatase tended to be higher at Visits 6 and 9 in the 400 mg/day group compared 
with placebo. The most frequently reported TEAEs associated with changes in clinical chemistry 
parameters was ‘ALT increased’ and ‘AST increased’ reported in 4 and 3 subjects respectively in the 
400 mg group. One subject in the 400 mg/day treatment group experienced serious TEAEs of ALT 
increased and AST increased on Study Day 42. 
Electrocardiograms 
During the double-blind treatment period, median changes in ECG parameters were small and 
generally similar between the treatment groups.  
Two ECG abnormalities were reported as TEAEs (1 in placebo group, 1 in 200 mg/day treatment 
group). No subjects had a QTcF >500 msec reported, and 1 subject (placebo) had a QTcF >450 msec 
and <480 msec reported during the double-blind treatment period. There were no reports of QTcF 
changes from baseline ≥60 msec (either increase or decrease) during the double-blind treatment 
period.

Study C013 
Haematology  
Although some abnormal values were noted in haematology parameters, none was clinically significant. 
The following haematologic TEAEs were noted in subjects treated with cenobamate: WBC count 
decreased (n=1), neutrophil count decreased (n=2), and neutropenia (n=1). These were modest 
decreases, 20-30%, at 1 or 2 visits (Visits 8-10). Among subjects treated with placebo, 1 had a TEAE 
of leukopenia and another had a TEAE of neutrophil count decreased. 
Clinical chemistry  
Minor mean elevations of ALT were seen during the treatment period. One subject treated with 
cenobamate had TEAEs of ALT increased and AST increased. One subject treated with placebo had a 
TEAE of transaminases increased. One placebo subject had a TEAE of AST increased. 
ECG 
No clinically significant changes from baseline were seen in the ECG parameters. 
LT OLE pool 
Haematology parameter values at baseline were comparable across the LT OLE groups. 
The haematocrit shifted to low values were seen in 8.7% of patients overall, while 4.8% of all patients 
had shifts to high haematocrit values including 5.5% of patients using placebo in the DB period. 
Leukocyte counts shifted to low values in 17.1% of all patients (15.2% of patients taking cenobamate 
in the DB period and 20.9% of those taking placebo in the DB period) and to high values in 7.3% of 
patients (no between-group difference). Neutrophil counts shifted to low values in 13.9% of patients 
and occurred more frequently in patients receiving placebo in the DB period (18.5% vs. 11.7% in 
patients receiving cenobamate in the DB period). Shifts to high neutrophil counts were seen in 8.5% of 
all patients, with no relevant between-group difference.  
Study C021 
Haematology parameters at baseline were comparable across groups for the different treatment 
groups in Study C021. Mean changes from baseline to the end of the titration period and over the 
maintenance phase were generally small and comparable between the groups. Decreases in mean 
platelet count were seen that appeared to be more pronounced in patients concomitantly using 
phenytoin or phenobarbital than in patients using other ASMs together with cenobamate. Small 
decreases in haemoglobin were seen in patients using cenobamate plus phenobarbital but not in the 
other patients.  
Haematocrit shifted to low values in 5.6% of patients overall, while 6.7% of patients had shift to low 
values, with no relevant differences between groups. Leukocyte counts shifted to low values in 13.8% 
overall (no between-group differences) and to high values in 9.0% overall (9.4% with cenobamate + 
other ASMs, 4.9% with cenobamate + phenytoin, 2.7% with cenobamate + phenobarbital). 
Lymphocyte counts shifted to low values in 8.2% overall and to high values in 5.5% overall, with no 
relevant between-group differences. Neutrophil counts shifted to low values in 13.8% of patients, with 
no between-group differences; shifts to high neutrophil counts occurred in 9.9% of all patients (10.1% 
with cenobamate + other ASMs, 11.0% with cenobamate + phenytoin, 0.0% with cenobamate + 
phenobarbital). Platelet shifts to high counts were seen in 7.7% of all patients, with no differences 
between groups; while 5.6% of patients receiving cenobamate and phenobarbital (but none of the 
other groups) had shifts to low values.

QT shortening  
In the DB Pool and OLE Pool, there were no relevant changes in mean ECG parameters from baseline, 
and no relevant differences between treatment groups. Additionally, there was no relevant difference 
in the occurrence of cardiac events seen between groups. 
- DB Pool: some patients had changes in QTcF from baseline of >30 ms, but none had changes of >60 
ms. Palpitations were the most reported cardiac AE.  
- study C017: several patients had QTcF values of <360 ms, but none had values of <340 ms. No 
patient had QTcF values of >500 ms, and none had QTcF changes from baseline of >60 ms. Cardiac 
disorder AEs were seen in some patients (bradycardia and sinus bradycardia in 1 patient each receiving 
cenobamate 200 mg; palpitations in both patients receiving cenobamate 400 mg; and sinus 
bradycardia and tachycardia in 1 patient each receiving placebo) 
- study C013: Several patients had QTcF values <360 ms, but none had values <340 ms. No patient 
had QTcF values of >500 ms, and none had QTcF changes from baseline of >60 ms. Cardiac disorder 
AEs were reported for 3 cenobamate patients (2.7%) and 2 placebo patients (1.8%). 
- OLE Pool: there were no patients with QTcF >500 ms in the OLE periods of the pivotal studies. One 
patient had a reported change from baseline QTcF of >60 ms in the cenobamate DB to OLE group at 
12 months. Some patients had clinically significant abnormal ECGs but no trend was found. Cardiac 
disorder AEs occurred in 3.6% of patients overall, including 3.2% of patients taking cenobamate and 
4.3% of patients taking placebo in the preceding DB period. 
- C021: there were slight decreases in mean HR and in QTcF by 12 and 24 months after the start of 
treatment in Study C021. There were no relevant differences in HR between groups. For QTcF, changes 
appeared most pronounced in the cenobamate + phenytoin group at 24 months. Cardiac disorder AEs 
occurred in 26 patients overall (1.9%). With the exception of 1 patient (1.2%) who received 
cenobamate with phenytoin (who had congestive cardiac failure), all patients with cardiac disorder AEs 
received cenobamate with other ASMs. 
In the cenobamate double-blind and long-term open label study subjects with cardiac past medical 
history were included however those with severe disease were excluded. Nevertheless 5.7% and 5.9% 
of cenobamate treated subjects had a prior medical history of cardiac disorders in the DB pool and in 
study C021 respectively. Over 90% of patients with cardiac history were able to complete the double-
blind studies. The vast majority of patients remain in the study at the time of data cut-off (82.9%). Of 
the patients who discontinued, only 3 discontinued due to adverse events (“rash maculopapular,” 
“fatigue” and “psychosis and suicide attempt.”).  
The incidence of subjects with cardiac disorder TEAEs across the cenobamate and placebo groups was 
comparable.  
In long-term open label studies, 3 cases of cardiovascular AEs with an outcome of death occurred in 
subjects taking cenobamate for at least 1 year and 11 months. Additionally, cardiac disorder SAEs 
occurred in 2 elderly subjects in long-term open label studies after at least 6 months of treatment.  
Liver parameters 
Liver parameters at baseline were comparable across treatment groups for the DB Pool. Mean ALT and 
AST tended to increase slightly to the end of the titration phase in cenobamate treatment groups, and 
the increase became greater with dose. This increase had disappeared by the end of the double-blind 
period. No relevant change in ALT or AST was seen in the placebo group. Mean ALKP increased in all 
cenobamate-treated patients both in the titration phase and the DB period overall, with no obvious

dose effect. No relevant change was seen in the placebo group. No relevant changes were seen for 
mean bilirubin levels.  
Notable (>5% of patients) shifts from normal or low baseline values to high values at any time 
postbaseline were seen for ALT in 9.8% of cenobamate-treated patients but only 4.7% of the placebo 
group. For the cenobamate group, a dose effect was seen for the proportion of patients with shifts to 
high ALT values (6.5% with cenobamate 100 mg, 8.2% with 200 mg, 16.5% with 400 mg). Shifts to 
high ALKP values occurred in 6.9% of cenobamate-treated patients vs. 2.8% of placebo patients with 
no systematic dose effect. Shifts to high AST values occurred in 4.8% of cenobamate patients (1.9% 
with cenobamate 100 mg, 5.0% with cenobamate 200 mg, 7.3% with 400 mg) vs. 3.3% of the 
placebo group. 
In the cenobamate 200 mg group, 7.3% of patients had shifts to low bilirubin values but there were no 
notable (>5%) shifts to low values for any other parameter or group. 
Alanine aminotransferase increases of ≥3 ULN occurred in 1.4% of cenobamate patients, and AST 
increases of ≥3 ULN occurred in 0.5%; no placebo patients had AST or ALT values ≥3 ULN. No patient 
had bilirubin values ≥2 ULN. Hence, there were no patients fulfilling the search criteria for potential 
Hy’s law cases (ALT/AST values >3 ULN, bilirubin >2 ULN, ALKP <2 ULN).  
In LT OLE pool, liver parameters at baseline were comparable across treatment groups for the LT OLE 
Pool. Mean ALKP increased in all groups; it was already apparent at the start of the OLE period in 
patients taking cenobamate in the preceding DB period, while it occurred only during the OLE period in 
patients taking placebo in the preceding DB period. No relevant trends were seen for the other liver 
parameters. Notable (>5% of patients) shifts from normal or low baseline values to high values at any 
time post-baseline were seen for ALKP (17.7% overall) and AST (7.8%). Notable (>5% of patients) 
shifts from high or normal baseline values to low values at any time post-baseline were seen for 
bilirubin (9.3%), with higher proportions in patients receiving placebo in the preceding DB period 
(14.8%) than in those receiving cenobamate in the DB period (6.7%).  
Alanine aminotransferase shifted to high values in 16.3% of patients and to low values in 9.9% of 
patients overall, with no relevant differences between groups. 
Alanine aminotransferase increases of ≥3 ULN occurred in 0.8% of all patients, and AST increases of 
≥3 ULN in 0.6% of patients. A single patient had bilirubin values ≥2 ULN. 
In Study C021, liver parameters at baseline were generally comparable across treatment groups for 
the different treatment groups in Study C021. There was no relevant trend over time or for differences 
between the groups, although mean ALKP tended to increase from baseline to 12 months in patients 
receiving cenobamate plus other ASMs and in the total study population. Patients receiving 
cenobamate and phenytoin had slight mean ALKP decreases at each time point. No relevant trend was 
seen for ALKP in the cenobamate + phenobarbital group. Notable (>5% of patients) shifts from normal 
or low baseline values to high values at any time post-baseline were seen for ALKP (15.4% overall), 
with no relevant treatment differences. Alanine aminotransferase shifted to lower values in 20.7% of 
patients (21.4% with cenobamate + other ASMs, 12.2% with cenobamate + phenytoin, 16.7% with 
cenobamate + phenobarbital) and to higher values in 20.6% of patients (no relevant treatment 
differences). Aspartate aminotransferase shifted to lower values in 5.6% of patients (6.0% with 
cenobamate + other ASMs, 1.2% with cenobamate + phenytoin, 2.8% with cenobamate + 
phenobarbital) and to higher values in 10.3% of patients (no relevant treatment differences).  
Alanine aminotransferase increases of ≥3 ULN occurred in 1.6% of cenobamate patients, and AST 
increases of ≥3 ULN occurred in 1.1 %. Two patients (0.1%) had bilirubin values ≥2 ULN.

Safety in special populations 
In the Pooled DB dataset, only 10 subjects >65 years of age were identified, 6 of whom were 
randomised to cenobamate. A total of 87 patients >65 participated in All Phase 2/3 Pool and 51 
subjects were >65 years of age at study entry.  
When the larger dataset of 87 subjects was analysed (dataset for subjects >65 during study 
participation), the overall incidence of most SAE SOCs for the elderly group was comparable to that in 
the younger group. The incidence of the most common (>5%) TEAEs for subjects >65 years of age 
during study participation was comparable with younger age groups. Adverse events known to be 
related to ASM such as fatigue, gait disturbance, fall, ataxia, balance disorder, dizziness and 
somnolence occurred in both younger and older age groups. However, higher incidence was observed 
in subjects above 65 years of age.  
Immunological events

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Potential drug-drug or drug-food PK interactions studies were performed in healthy subjects who 
received cenobamate co-administered with ASMs, oral contraceptives (OCs), and other medications, 
including bupropion (for CYP2B6), midazolam (for CYP3A), and omeprazole (for CYP2C19). In general, 
co-administration of cenobamate with ASMs, OCs, and other medications did not result, apparently, in 
safety concerns but might impact on therapeutic strategies. Because of an increase in systemic 
exposure of phenytoin or phenobarbital with cenobamate, dose of phenytoin or phenobarbital may 
need to be reduced in patients on concomitant cenobamate (see clinical pharmacology sections). 
In the carbamazepine interaction study, reductions in carbamazepine systemic exposure were noted 
with coadministration of cenobamate and carbamazepine but no effect of carbamazepine on 
cenobamate exposure was observed. 16 subjects experienced a total of 94 treatment-emergent AEs; 
of these, 65 were mild, 29 were moderate, and there were no severe AEs. The most commonly 
reported AEs were headache (n=9), abdominal pain (n=8), and constipation (n=8). No deaths, SAEs, 
or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred during this study. There were 2 clinically 
significant AEs of thrombocytopenia (1 mild and 1 moderate), which were considered to be unrelated 
to the study drug. One subject had a clinically significant AE of moderate orthostatic hypotension that 
was considered to be possibly related to the study drug. One subject experienced a moderate ECG PR 
prolongation that was considered to be possibly related to the study drug. 
In the divalproex study to assess the effect of a multiple-dose regimen of cenobamate on the plasma 
PK of divalproex, no significant drug interactions between cenobamate and divalproex were noted. Ten 
of the 16 subjects experienced a total of 44 AEs; of these, 33 were mild, 10 were moderate, and there 
were no severe AEs. The most commonly reported AEs were somnolence (n=10) and nausea (n=6). 
No deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred during this study. 
In the phenytoin interaction study assessing co-administration of cenobamate with phenytoin, with an 
observed resulting in increases in phenytoin exposure and decreases in cenobamate systemic 
exposure. Fifteen of the 16 subjects experienced a total of 187 AEs; of these, 159 were mild, 26 were 
moderate, and 2 were severe AEs (nausea and increased anticonvulsant drug concentration). The most 
commonly reported AEs were increased GGT (69%), headache (56%), ataxia (50%), somnolence 
(38%), dizziness (38%), nausea (38%), increased ALT (31%), and increased anticonvulsant drug level

(31%). There were no deaths in this study. One subject experienced an SAE of antiepileptic 
hypersensitivity syndrome, which was considered drug related, and withdrew from the study due to 
this AE. 
Data from phenobarbital interaction study showed a significant effect of cenobamate on the disposition 
of phenobarbital (+34% for Cmax,ss and +37% for AUC0-τ). Thirteen of the 16 subjects experienced a 
total of 96 AEs; of these, 75 were mild, 21 were moderate, and none were severe AEs. The most 
commonly reported AEs were weight decreased (8 [50%] subjects), followed by nausea, headache, 
and dizziness (4 [25%] subjects each). There were no deaths or SAEs reported in this study. Two 
subjects experienced drug-related rash events (angioedema and erythematous maculopapular rash); 
both events were moderate in intensity and considered to be related to both cenobamate and 
phenobarbital. One of the subjects discontinued from the study due to the event. 
The DB Pool comprised 76 patients receiving 1 concomitant ASM, 185 patients receiving 2 ASMs, and 
181 patients receiving more than 2 ASMs in the cenobamate group; and 28 patients receiving 1 
concomitant ASM, 98 patients receiving 2 ASMs, and 90 patients receiving more than 2 ASMs in the 
placebo group. The median duration of exposure to cenobamate was higher than for placebo for 
patients treated with 2 ASMs (17.86 weeks with cenobamate, 13.21 weeks for placebo), and more 
than 2 ASMs (18.00 weeks with cenobamate, 14.50 weeks for placebo). For patients receiving ≥2 
ASMs the proportion of patients treated for ≥12 weeks was lower for the cenobamate group (84.0% 
vs. 93.3% placebo). 
The overall frequency of AEs was higher for patients treated with cenobamate compared with placebo 
patients treated with >2 ASMs; a dose-related increase in the overall event frequency was also seen 
for patients treated with 2 or >2 other ASMs. There was no notable difference in the overall AE rate 
when comparing groups taking different numbers of concomitant ASMs. Cenobamate-treated patients 
taking >2 concomitant ASMs had a higher overall frequency of treatment-related AEs than those taking 
2 ASMs and higher proportions of patients also having dizziness (30.4% vs. 14.6% of those taking 2 
ASMs) and somnolence (29.8% vs. 18.9%). 
Higher study discontinuation was described in patients having a higher number of concomitant ASMs. 
In study C021, patients were given cenobamate on top of different monotherapy with phenytoin 
(N=83), phenobarbital (N=37) and other non-specified ASMs (N=1220)). The proportion of AEs were 
slightly higher for patients receiving cenobamate with phenobarbital, namely with somnolence and 
fatigue. The frequency of toxicity to other agents was higher for patients receiving cenobamate and 
phenytoin. The frequency of other AEs was comparable between treatment groups. AEs severity, 
Treatment-related AEs, Severe AEs proportion and rate of study drug discontinuation due to AEs were 
comparable among groups.  
Analyses of several subgroups of concomitant ASMs were undertaken:  
- Safety and efficacy analyses of GABA modulators and sodium channel blockers were undertaken 
because of a focally overlapping mechanism of action with cenobamate. Overall, there were no notable 
differences in the frequency of severe, treatment-related or serious AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation when comparing patients who did or did not use concomitant sodium channel blockers 
or GABA modulators. 
- Given the specificity of the GABAA receptor and the safety profile of benzodiazepines which differ 
from other GABA-ergic ASMs, benzodiazepines were analysed separately from the other GABA 
modulators (and not included in the GABA modulator analysis).  An increase in AE rates, notably 
somnolence was observed, but no additional safety signals were detected.  However, it should be 
noted that the population of patients on benzodiazepines was small.

- A further safety analysis was done for the subpopulation of patients on concomitant clobazam, which 
was the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepine.  Note, the population of patients on clobazam was 
also included in the full benzodiazepine analysis. Cenobamate has the potential to increase levels of 
the clobazam active metabolite via induction of CYP3A and inhibition of CYP2C19. A subanalysis of 
patients in Study C017 showed an increased frequency of certain adverse events, including dizziness, 
somnolence, and fatigue in patients taking clobazam compared to those not taking clobazam.   
In the study on co-administration of cenobamate with the oral contraceptive Ortho-Novum for 14 days, 
a total of 23 (82.1%) subjects reported 152 AEs during the study. The greatest number of AEs was 
reported following dosing with combination therapy (79 AEs in 18 [64.3%] subjects), followed by 
cenobamate monotherapy (55 AEs in 18 [69.2%] subjects), and Ortho- Novum monotherapy (18 AEs 
in 12 [42.9%] subjects). The majority of AEs were mild (138 of 152 AEs). There were no deaths or 
SAEs were reported.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the DB pool a larger proportion of patients receiving cenobamate experienced an AE that led to 
study drug discontinuation (13.1% vs. 4.2% in the placebo group). The most frequent AEs that led to 
study drug discontinuation were ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, vertigo, and nystagmus. The incidence 
of study drug discontinuation due to an AE slightly increased with dose for most preferred terms. 
In the Phase 2/3 Pool, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 14.3% of the patients. The 
only AE leading to discontinuation in >1% of patients was dizziness (29 patients, 1.5%). 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (19.0% vs. 13.1%) were higher in the LT OLE Pool than for 
the DB Pool. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were slightly lower in Study C021 compared to 
the DB Pool (10.2% vs. 13.1%) 
The proportion of patients taking cenobamate who had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 
higher for patients receiving 2 concomitant ASMs (11.4% of those receiving cenobamate vs. 5.1% of 
those receiving placebo; 7.0% for the 100 mg/day dose group, 8.2% for the 200 mg/day group and 
22.7% for the 400 mg/day group) and for patients receiving >2 ASMs (14.9% of those receiving 
cenobamate vs. 2.2% of those receiving placebo. 
The proportion of patients with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was comparable for 
cenobamate-treated patients using concomitant sodium channel blockers (13.1% for cenobamate-
treated patients vs. 3.9% for the placebo group) and those not using sodium channel blockers (13.1% 
vs. 5.3%).  
The proportion of patients with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was similar for cenobamate-
treated patients using concomitant GABA modulators (13.2% vs. 4.8% for the placebo group) and 
those not using GABA modulators (13.1% vs. 3.6%).  
The proportion of patients with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was higher for cenobamate-
treated patients using concomitant benzodiazepines (17.1% vs. 7.5% for the placebo group) than 
those not using benzodiazepines (11.8% vs. 3.1%; 8.5% for the 100 mg/day dose group, 9.5% for the 
200 mg/day group and 20.0% for the 400 mg/day group).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of cenobamate has been well characterised through the clinical development 
programme with high completion rates in the DB Pooled population, and high retention and long 
exposures in both the LT OLE studies, and in the large open label safety study C021. The profile of AEs 
in cenobamate-treated patients was consistent between studies and analysis pools when considering a 
range of common treatment-related AEs, primarily somnolence, dizziness, fatigue and headache.  
The most common adverse events reported were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue and headache. Other 
common events included confusional state, irritability, diplopia, dysarthria, nystagmus, aphasia and 
memory impairment. Other AEs seen at lower frequency included ataxia and gastrointestinal events 
such as nausea, vomiting and constipation 
The vast majority of the AEs were mild to moderate in nature and resolved with the time.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate showed a dose relationship for dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, 
nausea, balance disorder, nystagmus, constipation, vomiting, gait disturbance, ataxia, dysarthria, 
vertigo, confusional state, blurred vision and ALT increase. 
AEs leading to discontinuation were higher for cenobamate compared to placebo in the DB Pool and 
highest in the 400 mg/day group.  
Different titration schemes were used in the clinical studies. Generally, frequency and pattern of AEs 
were similar across titration schedules, however the severity was higher with the faster weekly titration 
schemes. In particular, all 3 DRESS cases occurred in studies with rapid titration. Even though the 
proposed gradual slower titration scheme (every 2 weeks) was only assessed in a safety targeting trial 
(C021), the CHMP agreed that it is supported by the safety results and would mitigate more common 
AEs. 
There was a decrease in frequency of AEs during the maintenance compared to the titration 
phase for all patients treated with cenobamate and the placebo group. Somnolence, dizziness and 
fatigue frequency across the dose groups was notably lower during the maintenance phase than during 
the titration phase. It was comparable to the frequency seen in the placebo group, even in the 400 
mg/day arm.  
No new safety signals were seen in the long-term data. With long term exposure, AEs were similar in 
nature to those seen in the DB studies. There was a slight increase in the frequency of AEs likely due 
to the longer treatment duration. 
Adverse events of special interest included events of suicidal nature, selected adverse skin reactions 
and DRESS.  
Cenobamate did not appear to result in increases in suicidal ideation, intensity or behaviour above 
the expected background rate. Even though some cases of completed suicide and suicidal 
behaviour/suicidal ideation were described, after reviewing the cases, the CHMP agrees that most 
suicidality cases resolved without treatment reduction or discontinuation and that the warning in SmPC 
section 4.4 regarding the risk of suicidal ideation is acceptable. 
Proportions of patients experiencing skin reactions and those leading to discontinuation were 
comparable for patients receiving cenobamate and placebo. There were no Grade 5 skin reactions and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 110/122 
 
 
 
no reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. DRESS was reported in 3 
patients, all in studies with rapid (weekly) titration scheduled. 
QT shortening was observed in the clinical programme and a dose-dependent shortening of the QTcF 
interval has been observed with cenobamate (see pharmacology discussion). This important safety 
concern could not be fully clarified, as, for instances, it was unclear whether cardiovascular 
compromised individuals were included in the studies. The incidence of subjects with cardiac disorder 
TEAEs across the cenobamate and placebo groups was comparable. Pre-clinical data did not support an 
increased cardiovascular risk. Of the subjects with cardiac past medical history the majority were able 
to complete the double-blind studies and remain in the study at the time of data cut-off (82.9%). In 
long term open label studies, 3 cases of cardiovascular AEs with an outcome of death occurred in 
subjects taking cenobamate for at least 1 year and 11 months. Additionally, cardiac disorder SAEs 
occurred in 2 elderly subjects in long term open label studies after at least 6 months of treatment. 
Sinus bradycardia and supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block complete and 
atrioventricular block first degree were the only events that were reported in patients >65years old. 
There is insufficient information on these cases to assess any contribution of cenobamate or other 
ASM. Overall, in view of the available data, the CHMP agrees to inclusion of a warning in the SmPC 
regarding caution when prescribing cenobamate in combination with other medicinal product known to 
shorten the QT as well as the contraindication for use in patients with “Familial short QT syndrome”. 
There were 2 reports of hyperkalaemia in the clinical programme no critical values were identified and 
none were associated with cardiac AEs. The CHMP therefore agrees no further action is needed.  
There seems to be a trend for decreased platelet levels with cenobamate treatment both in the DB and 
LT OLE groups assessment but with no impact on the percentage of subjects with shifts from normal at 
baseline to low during treatment.  
There were no intentional cases of cenobamate overdose, misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence. There 
were very few discontinuation-emergent AEs reported that could be interpreted as withdrawal or rebound 
effects. Data did not point to a higher incidence of mood effects, including euphoria.  
In view of the notable difference in the frequency of the AEs related to the ability to drive or operate a 
machinery between the cenobamate and placebo group, the CHMP agrees with the recommendation 
not to drive or operate a machinery while treated with cenobamate. 
The overall incidence of subjects with TEAEs for the renal impairment subgroup for cenobamate treated 
subjects did not differ from those with normal creatinine clearance. Similarly, the overall incidence of 
cenobamate subjects with TEAEs for the elevated transaminase subgroup did not differ from those with 
normal transaminase levels.  
Whereas the available data showed no additional safety risk in elderly subjects, a higher incidence of 
adverse events such as fatigue, gait disturbance, fall, ataxia, balance disorder, dizziness and 
somnolence was observed in subjects above 65 years of age. The CHMP agrees with the proposed 
SmPC wording regarding the use in patients > 65years old in section 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Analyses of several subgroups of concomitant ASMs were also undertaken and demonstrated no 
notable differences in the frequency of severe, treatment-related or serious AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation when comparing patients who did or did not use concomitant sodium channel blockers 
or GABA modulators. Cenobamate-treated patients using concomitant benzodiazepines had an increase 
in AE rates, notably somnolence, and had a higher proportion of AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. It was however noted that the population of patients on benzodiazepines was small. A 
further safety analysis was done for the subpopulation of patients on concomitant clobazam, the most 
frequently prescribed benzodiazepine, and the 400mg cenobamate dose was associated with more AEs 
Assessment report

Page 111/122 
 
 
 
especially when taken concomitantly with clobazam, suggesting a need to decrease clobazam. The 
information is correctly reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the RMP version 1.0 is acceptable.  
With regards to future post-marketing exposure estimations (i.e. also in PSURs), the applicant should 
continue to consider the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for cenobamate, as established by the WHO 
Collaborating Centre (200 mg), and, in particular, detail how the titration period and maintenance 
period are, respectively, taken into account in this calculation.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.11.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of cenobamate with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cenobamate to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ontozry (cenobamate) is included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 115/122 
 
 
 
 
additional monitoring list as cenobamate is a new active substance and authorised after 1 January 
2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for the adjunctive treatment of adult epilepsy patients with focal onset 
seizures (FOS) with or without secondary generalisation who have not been adequately controlled 
despite a history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic products. 
The aim of the treatment is to significantly reduce seizure frequency and eliminate them if possible, 
while not adding drug-related morbidity. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Antiepileptic Drugs (ASMs) are the mainstay of epilepsy treatment, but adverse events of ASMs are a 
major source of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Adverse effects result in early treatment 
discontinuation in up to 25% of patients. Cutaneous manifestations of hypersensitivity are the most 
common idiosyncratic reactions to ASMs and range from mild urticarioid/maculopapular eruptions to 
the more severe drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). 
Approximately 63% of people with epilepsy will achieve longer-term seizure freedom, and most 
achieve that after the first or second ASM treatment. However, approximately 35 to 40 % of epilepsy 
cases, particularly those with focal seizures are drug resistant. When a first ASM fails, further ASMs will 
be initiated. Polytherapy is usually offered after failure of 2 or 3 sequential monotherapies but may be 
considered earlier when prognostic factors indicate a difficult-to-treat form of epilepsy unlikely to 
respond fully to monotherapy. Chen et al demonstrated that the initial ASM leads to 45.7% of patients 
achieving seizure freedom. If the initial ASM is ineffective, the second ASM results in an 11.6% chance 
of seizure freedom. Once a patient has failed a second ASM only 4.4% will achieve seizure freedom if a 
third regimen is required. For patients who failed 3 ASMs, only 2.1% of patients will achieved seizure 
control on multiple subsequent ASM regimens irrespective of the specific medications chosen. Some 
studies suggest that compared to all patients with epilepsy, those with focal onset epilepsy have an 
even higher risk of >50% to develop Drug Resistant Epilepsy (DRE). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is a phase II multicentre, randomised, double-blind comparing 
cenobamate in three different doses (n=329) versus placebo (n=108) as adjunctive treatment for 
patients with Focal-Onset Seizures who have failed at least two previous treatments with 12 weeks 
maintenance period (study C017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 116/122 
 
 
 
A second phase II multicentre randomised, double-blind comparing cenobamate 200 mg vs placebo as 
adjunctive in on treatment for patients with Focal Onset Seizures who have failed at least two previous 
treatments and 6 weeks maintenance period (study C013) supports the main study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The data from the main and supportive studies confirmed the efficacy of Ontozry in the claimed 
indication: 
Study C017: 
- The responder rate (as primary endpoint: responder as at least 50% Focal Onset Seizure frequency 
reduction) was 40.2% for 100mg cenobamate, 56.1% for 200mg cenobamate and 64.2% for 400mg 
cenobamate as compared to 25.5% for placebo. 
- The % change in seizure frequency FOS frequency rate (secondary endpoint) in the maintenance 
phase (median, minimum, maximum) was -41.5; -100, 150 for 100mg, -56.5; -100, 188 for 200mg 
and -63.0; -100, 133 for 300mg compared to -27.0; -100, 282 for placebo. 
- 3.9% of 100mg subjects were seizure free during the maintenance phase (secondary endpoint: 
responder as 100% FOS frequency reduction), 11.2% for 200mg and 21.1% for 400mg compared to 
1.0% for placebo. 
- Regarding the responder rate for (≥50% seizure frequency reduction) FOS frequency reduction in 
secondarily generalised, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures during the maintenance phase 
(secondary endpoint), there was 61.8% responders in the 100mg group, 78.1% for 200mg and 66.7% 
for 400mg compared to 48.8% for placebo. 
Study C013 yielded comparable results for cenobamate 200 mg vs. placebo, based upon original 
statistical analysis plan. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main limitations regarding the main C017 study results (and the supportive study C013) is the 
methodology for assessment of responders. It is based upon a seizure diary, and missing data in the 
diary is counted as the mean value within the studied period.  Also, drop-out patient data missingness 
would also be similarly treated. To reduce the uncertainty and confirm the result robustness, 
supplementary analyses with different estimand and sensitivity analysis with different imputation 
strategies have been conducted. The analyses provided have confirmed the magnitude of results and 
increased robustness. 
Sub analyses show that patients on treatment with lamotrigine and benzodiazepines) have less 
improvement. For Lamotrigine, this is believed to be due to a PK interaction with cenobamate 
perpetrating over lamotrigine and is described in the SmPC. For benzodiazepine, this is probably due to 
baseline imbalances in the trials.  
Although focal onset seizures are the most common seizure in elderly patients, scarce data is available 
regarding patients older than 65 years of age. 
Although the open-label extension studies have durations of up to 5 years, in view of the high placebo 
effect, the magnitude of cenobamate effect on the long term cannot be ascertained. No randomised 
withdrawal study has been performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/160820/2021  
Page 117/122 
 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following unfavourable effects were identified: 
- Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): 
- Considered as an adverse event of special interest, DRESS was described in 3 subjects of the 
clinical trials (1 patient with epilepsy and 2 healthy volunteers). One patient died with 
eosinophilic myocarditis that was associated with DRESS and considered possibly related to 
cenobamate. DRESS occurred in subjects in studies starting at higher doses (>= 50mg) and 
with rapid (weekly or less) titration scheduled. Study C021 was conducted with a slower 
titration scheme (as proposed in the SmPC) and no new cases of DRESS have been described 
in more than 1340 patients exposed (including 1134 patients for at least 6 months).  
- The risk for higher than expected starting dose and DRESS development exists. 
- Somnolence, Dizziness, Vertigo, Balance disorder, Ataxia, Gait disturbance and abnormal 
coordination, Headache: 
- These ADRs are more frequently described for all doses, titration schemes and ASMs 
combinations, with dose-relationship documented for some of them. They were mostly mild to 
moderate and seldom associated with study drug or study withdrawal.  
- Ataxia and dizziness were the most frequent AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. 
- Dysarthria, Nystagmus, Aphasia, Memory impairment, Confusional state, Irritability: these ADRs 
were described by some patients and may be a diagnostic challenge due to the patient’ background 
condition or co-treatments. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The following uncertainties regarding the unfavourable effects were identified: 
- Potential for higher rate of AEs depending on the combinations with other ASMs or other drugs: 
- Not enough evidence has been generated on the possible different drug combinations to be 
sure on what are the safer and more AEs associated combination treatments. 
- Interaction with Oral Contraceptives: 
- No formal studies have been conducted to assess Contraceptive Use impact of cenobamate at 
doses higher than 100mg doses which are expected to be taken. 
- QT shortening:  
- Although QT shortening had no clinically significant impact at proposed treatment doses there 
was a significant decrease of QTcF of unknown clinical relevance at higher doses. The cardiac 
risk in cases of overdose is possible. No information on exposure of patients with established 
cardiovascular disease is discussed.  
- Information on exposure in renal or hepatic impaired patients on the clinical studies is lacking. 
- There is a lack of information on exposure of patients older than 65years old.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoints were met in both Phase II clinical studies. Statistically significant difference in 
responder  rate  for  each  of  the  cenobamate  treatment  groups  compared  to  placebo  during  the

maintenance phase was demonstrated in Study C017. The percent change in seizure frequency per 28 
days was statistically significant higher in cenobamate 200 mg group (p<0.0001) compared to placebo 
group in Study C013.  
The magnitude of effect on the reduction of seizure frequency is clinically significant, particularly in 
relation to the studied population which tends to become treatment resistant. An improvement of 20 to 
40% over placebo is deemed significant. 
Besides DRESS which is a concern and must be actively monitored, most adverse events are CNS 
related. The safety profile with the frequency of somnolence, fatigue and dizziness is of concern, 
especially in the highest cenobamate group. Dizziness, leading to discontinuation, should also be 
managed and minimised. 
Drug-drug interactions, particularly with cenobamate as perpetrator is of concern, both for other ASMs 
and contraceptives. QT shortening has not raised as a concern within therapeutic range, but it may 
cause significant AEs in the higher doses. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of cenobamate in an adjunctive treatment of focal onset seizure in adult who have not 
been adequately controlled despite treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic medicinal products has been 
appropriately demonstrated. The effects on seizures frequency are clinically relevant and the overall 
benefit outweighs the unfavourable effects. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ontozry is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ontozry is not similar to Epidyolex or Fintepla within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Ontozry is favourable in the following indication: 
Ontozry is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of focal-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in adult patients with epilepsy who have not been 
adequately controlled despite a history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic 
products. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Assessment report

Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that cenobamate is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

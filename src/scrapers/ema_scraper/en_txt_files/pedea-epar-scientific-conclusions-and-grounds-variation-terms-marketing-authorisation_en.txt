Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ibuprofen (indicated in ductus 
arteriosus), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Considering the morbidity and mortality associated with gastric perforation, the suspicion of causality 
attributed to Pedea by the reporters in 4/5 cases, the existence of a biologically plausible mechanism, and 
the rarity of the condition amongst all gastrointestinal perforations in the neonatal period, the MAH is 
requested to add the adverse reaction “gastric perforation” in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 
“unknown” in order to alert healthcare professionals to the possibility of this specific adverse drug 
reaction. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibuprofen (indicated in ductus arteriosus) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ibuprofen (indicated in ductus 
arteriosus) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

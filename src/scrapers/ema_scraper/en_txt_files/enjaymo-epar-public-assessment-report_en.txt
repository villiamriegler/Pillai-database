2.  Scientific discussion 
1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Enjaymo is proposed for the treatment of haemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease 
(CAD).  
Epidemiology  
Primary CAD is a rare disease. In retrospective reviews from Nordic countries, the incidence has been 
estimated at approximately 1 to 1.8 per million and the prevalence at approximately 13 to 16 per 
million with higher prevalence in colder climates. The prevalence is slightly higher in females than in 
males and the median age of diagnosis in the late 60s with a broad range (30s to 90s). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CAD is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies (typically immunoglobin M [IgM]) called cold 
agglutinins that bind to the I antigen uniformly present on the surface of all RBCs at an optimum 
temperature of 3-4°C, but can also react at higher temperatures, depending on the thermal amplitude. 
This leads to agglutination of RBCs and/or to complement activation through the classical pathway (CP) 
with subsequent haemolysis. Not all individuals with circulating cold agglutinins have clinical disease, 
and some patients only present with symptoms if exposed to cold temperatures or in relation to 
infectious disease, trauma or surgery. The complement-coated RBCs are cleared from circulation 
predominantly through phagocytosis by liver macrophages causing extravascular haemolysis; however, 
also intravascular haemolysis could be found especially during periods of increased haemolysis, caused 
by activation of the terminal pathway of complement, leading to the formation of the membrane attack 
complex and RBC destruction. 
Primary CAD is defined as an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia mediated by cold agglutinins without 
any obvious underlying disease such as aggressive lymphoma, other overt malignancies, or specific 
infections. (Secondary) cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) pertains to the more uncommon, secondary 
cold agglutinin-mediated haemolytic anaemia occasionally complicating other specific diseases, such as 
certain infections or aggressive lymphoma. Most patients with primary CAD are however thought to 
have a low-grade clonal bone marrow disorder. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The main clinical presentation of cold agglutinin disease is twofold: cold-related symptoms such as 
acrocyanosis and Raynaud's phenomenon induced by agglutination of RBCs, in accordance with 
thermal amplitude of the cold agglutinins, and/or autoimmune-type haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) caused 
by IgM-induced CP activation. Chronic haemolysis is common in CAD, ranging from compensated 
haemolysis without anaemia to severe haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion, with symptoms of 
anaemia such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and chest pain. 
Generally accepted diagnostic criteria include the following: evidence of haemolysis (e.g., high 
reticulocyte count, high LDH, high indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin), positive direct antiglobulin 
(Coombs) test for C3d only (or, in a minority, C3d plus weak IgG) and cold agglutinin titre of ≥64 at 
4°C. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 10/135 
 
 
 
Management 
In typical primary CAD, with or without a detectable low-grade bone marrow lymphoproliferative 
disorder, treatment is indicated for symptomatic individuals. Treatment is directed at minimizing cold-
induced symptoms, maintaining an acceptable haemoglobin level, and, if required, addressing 
underlying disorders. Patients who have symptomatic anaemia or cold-induced ischemic symptoms 
interfering with daily living could receive therapy to reduce antibody production, primarily using 
rituximab alone or in combinations; none of these is however approved for CAD. Corticosteroids and/or 
splenectomy are usually not effective in primary CAD. Plasmapheresis may be used for immediate but 
transitory relief especially during periods of severe haemolysis. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions could 
also be used to correct anaemia; the need of transfusions varies substantially between individuals with 
primary CAD and could be indicated only during periods of severe haemolysis precipitated by e.g., 
infectious disease or cold exposure. 
2.  About the product 
Sutimlimab (BIVV009; TNT009) is a first-in-class, humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG), subclass 4 
(IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the classical pathway (CP) by inhibiting the classical 
CP-specific serine protease, specifically binding to complement component 1 (C1), s subcomponent 
(C1s). Complement C1s, which along with C1r and C1q is a part of the C1 complex that sits at the 
apex of the CP (see Figure 1). By binding C1s, sutimlimab prevents the enzymatic action of the C1 
complex on its substrate, complement factors C4, and thereby blocks the formation of the C3 
convertase. Upstream inhibition of the classical pathway is expected to retain the important immune 
surveillance functional activities of lectin and alternative pathways. 
Figure 1. The Three Activation Pathways of the Complement System 
Assessment report

Page 11/135 
 
 
 
 
 
Sutimlimab has been developed for the treatment of haemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin 
disease (CAD), a life-threatening chronic orphan disease. Sutimlimab inhibits haemolysis in patients 
with CAD through inhibition of the classical complement pathway. The proposed dose regimen of 
sutimlimab is 6.5 g (for patients >39 kg and <75 kg) or 7.5 g (for patients ≥75 kg), depending on the 
patient’s body weight. Sutimlimab is to be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 1-2 hours 
once per week for the first 2 doses followed by every two weeks dosing thereafter. Enjaymo is 
intended for continuous use as chronic therapy only, unless the discontinuation of Enjaymo is clinically 
indicated. Patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease may receive the infusion over 2 hours. 
3.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Sutimlimab, the active substance in Enjaymo, is an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(MAb) produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Enjaymo is presented as solution for infusion in a single-use vial with a strength of 50 mg/mL. One vial 
contains 1100 mg of sutimlimab in 22 mL. 
Sutimlimab is formulated with polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium 
phosphate monobasic and water for injections.  
Active Substance 
General Information 
Sutimlimab, also referred to as BIVV009, is a humanised IgG4 MAb specific for C1s esterase (EC 
3.4.21.42). The antibody is expressed by recombinant CHO cells and produced in vitro using standard 
mammalian cell culture methods followed by chromatographic purification.  
BIVV009 is composed of two heterodimers. Each of the heterodimers is composed of a heavy and a 
light polypeptide chain. Each heavy chain (HC) is composed of 445 amino acids and each light chain 
(LC) contains 216 amino acids.  
BIVV009 contains a total of 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds, 4 within each of the two HCs and 2 within 
each of the two LCs. BIVV009 contains a serine-to-proline mutation (S241P), based on the Kabat 
numbering system, which stabilises the core-hinge region of the molecule. In addition, BIVV009 
contains a leucine-to-glutamic acid mutation (L248E) that abrogates Fcγ receptor binding. 
The predicted molecular weight (MW) of non-glycosylated, native BIVV009 is approximately 144,813 
Da based on its amino acid sequence of 1322 residues.  
The glycosylation site is located on the HC at N295. 
The information in this section is considered sufficient. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturer(s) 
Sutimlimab active substance is manufactured by Biogen, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. The name, 
address, and responsibilities of manufacturers involved in the manufacture, storage, and testing of the 
intermediates and the active substance is available in the dossier. The submitted information is 
considered sufficient. All sites operate in compliance with EU GMP.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of sutimlimab active substance encompasses cell culture, harvest and 
primary capture, purification by three chromatography steps, low-pH viral inactivation, virus filtration, 
concentration, formulation and 0.2 um filtration to final fill and refrigerated storage. The manufacturing 
process and process controls are summarised in flow charts and tables. The purpose of each step is 
clearly stated, and a brief description is provided. Process parameters and in-process controls (IPC) are 
listed, including criticality assignment. Operating sequences, resin and filter materials, buffers, number 
of cycles, reuses (where applicable), and collection of fractions are provided for the chromatography 
steps and the filtration steps. The unprocessed bulk is tested for adventitious agents (viruses, 
bioburden, and mycoplasma). The level of detail is considered sufficient. 
Each working cell bank (WCB) vial give rise to one active substance batch. The scale of the production 
bioreactor chromatography, virus filtration, and ultra-/diafiltration (UF/DF)  and the final active 
substance steps are given.  
In-process pool hold times and hold conditions are sufficiently described for each step. Resin and 
membrane reuse is, supported by small-scale data and at-scale validation activities. The approach to 
microbial control of the process is considered adequate.  
Active substance transportation is sufficiently described. 
Thus, reprocessing is not performed for the sutimlimab active substance manufacturing process. 
In summary, it can be concluded that the description of the  manufacturing process and process 
controls is acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
Detailed descriptions of raw materials and consumables and the active substance storage container are 
presented. Specifications with acceptance criteria are provided for non-compendial raw materials 
including process solutions. No animal-derived material is used during manufacture of the active 
substance. However, animal-derived material was used during early development of the host cell line 
as mentioned below. The information regarding raw materials is sufficient. 
Source, history and generation of the cell substrate 
The history and development of the antibody and the CHO-M cell line lineage is sufficiently described 
as are the construction and rationale of gene constructs and expression vectors. The predicted amino 
acid sequences of both heavy and light chains are presented. The development of the CHO-M host cell 
line into the antibody producing research cell bank (RCB) is described and the route to monoclonality 
shown, in line with ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D guidelines. 
Cell banks 
The cell bank system and the preparation of the cell banks are sufficiently described for the master cell 
bank (MCB), WCB and extended end-of-production cell bank (EEOPCB), including storage, handling, 
identification and number of vials produced.  
The cell banks, including the EEOPCB, were tested according to ICH Q5A (R1). The extended cell banks 
were tested for identity, sterility, mycoplasma and adventitious agents. Bovine and porcine cell lines 
were included for in vitro testing of the MCB. A Certificate of Analysis and Certificate of Suitability are 
provided and acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in 
the establishment of cell substrate The testing of cell banks is in line with ICH Q5A and any risk of TSE 
is negligible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 13/135 
 
 
 
Genetic stability was tested on the MCB, WCB and EEOPCB cells. The confirmation of genetic stability is 
in line with ICH Q5B and acceptable. 
The MCB and WCB are stored under GMP conditions at two separate locations as a risk mitigation. Cell 
bank storage stability data is shown, MCB and WCB stability upon storage will be addressed at least 
every 5 and 3 years, respectively. 
A protocol for new WCB is provided and found acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Definitions for critical quality attributes (CQA), proven acceptable ranges (PAR), normal operating 
ranges (NOR), critical process parameters (CPP), key process parameters (KPP), IPCs, action limits and 
acceptance criteria are provided in 3.2.S.2.4 and aligned with relevant guidelines. This is endorsed. 
Process parameter criticality is based on the impact to CQAs and process consistency and the IPCs are 
linked to consistent performance of relevant attributes. Process parameters are controlled within PARs. 
IPCs are tested against action limits or acceptance criteria.  
Management of deviations to process parameters ranges and IPC limits is acceptably described. 
The analytical procedures used for in-process testing are described in sufficient detail. They were also 
demonstrated to be suitable for their intended use. 
In summary, process parameters and IPCs critical to the active substance manufacturing process are 
acceptably presented. 
Process validation and evaluation 
An extensive set of studies for process validation is presented, along with descriptions of methods and 
tools and completed for the active substance manufacturing process.  
The process validation of the active substance manufacturing steps at commercial scale at Biogen is 
adequately described and reported. The manufacturing process was executed according to the 
description in 3.2.S.2.2.  
The approach to demonstrate clearance of process-related and product-related impurities has been 
sufficiently demonstrated during process validation and is endorsed. A control for host cell proteins 
(HCP) is included in the active substance release specification. 
Analytical methods used during process validation studies, were validated as appropriate for intended 
use The analytical method validations are provided. The level of information is considered sufficient, no 
concerns are raised. 
Sufficient information is provided regarding impact of extractables and leachables from single use 
contact materials. 
The hold times study approach for biochemical and microbial stability is considered acceptable (scale, 
containers/vessels, sampling, test panel, supportive small-scale studies). Biochemical and microbial 
hold times and hold conditions are considered validated.  
Small-scale data support the proposed reuse of chromatography resins and UF/DF membranes. 
Concurrent validation of resin lifetime limits is performed during commercial manufacturing according 
to provided protocols. The overall strategy and proposed testing are approvable. The ultrafiltration 
membrane will be subjected to real-time testing – as long as the criteria are fulfilled, the membrane 
may be used. This is acceptable. 
Reprocessing is not validated.

The outlined continued (ongoing) process verification program (trending and analysis to ensure that 
the process remains in its validated state) is endorsed. 
In summary, it is agreed that the process validation results support the conclusion that the 
manufacturing processes for sutimlimab active substance can be considered validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing history and manufacturing process changes 
Two different versions of the active substance manufacturing process have been used during clinical 
development. Changes between the clinical processes and the commercial process are clearly outlined. 
The description of the changes leading to the commercial active substance process is available in the 
validation section and the comparability section. The aspects considered and the panel of tests 
included in the comparability exercise are considered sufficient and in compliance with ICH Q5E. 
CQAs 
CQAs are defined in accordance with ICH Q8. This is endorsed. Identification of CQAs encompass a 
multidisciplinary risk assessment of the potential impact on biological activity or efficacy, 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity and safety of the product, and the uncertainty of 
the knowledge regarding the impact. The approach as such is supported and considered sufficiently 
described. The scoring system is explained and a summary table describing the outcome of the risk 
assessment is provided. The scoring of the uncertainty is partly based on prior knowledge from 
“related molecules/similar class of molecules”. The use of prior knowledge is considered appropriately 
justified. The proposed classification of CQAs and non-CQAs is acceptable.  
Control strategy 
An extensive process development program is submitted, including justifications for all stages of the 
proposed active substance manufacturing process which consists of a traditional set of PARs (proven 
acceptable range), and in some cases NORs (a minimal level of variation around the target setpoint). 
PAR is defined in accordance with ICH Q8. Overall, the approach for control strategy development is 
considered scientifically sound.  
Process parameter criticality was determined by preliminary risk assessment (unit operation impact to 
CQAs), process characterisation studies which included evaluation of practical significance, and a final 
updated risk assessment (seemingly traditional failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) taking 
severity, occurrence and detectability into account). Process parameters identified as not impacting 
CQAs or process performance were identified as non-KPPs. This methodology is supported. 
Quality by Design (QbD) elements such as risk assessments and design of experiments (DoE) were 
included during process development.  
The applied strategy for small-scale model (SSM) qualification is supported and is considered qualified 
and representative  of the commercial scales.  
Process characterization development studies were performed to identify PARs for process 
parameters.. Process parameter impact to quality and performance, respectively, determined the 
severity ranking for the final risk assessment and criticality assignment of process parameters. The 
final outcome of the FMEA analysis, including justified changes made due to PPQ, is found acceptable. 
The proposed process parameter criticality assignment is approvable. 
In summary, the process development program and the resulting proposed final control strategy is 
considered appropriate and supportive of the proposed manufacturing process. 
Comparability 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 15/135 
 
 
 
Three different comparability studies are presented for the clinical processes and the commercial 
process to demonstrate comparability across the process versions.  
The comparability studies encompass release tests, characterisation testing, stability studies and 
forced degradation (temperature, light).  
The aspects considered and the panel of tests included in the comparability exercise are considered 
sufficient and in compliance with ICH Q5E. Results are presented in tables displaying individual results 
for post-change batches, historical ranges for pre-change batches, comparability criteria, and clinical 
active substance specification. Individual batches are not plotted but chromatograms, 
electropherograms and spectras are provided, and conclusions are clearly stated.  
Comparability criteria for several attributes are based on tolerance intervals. The resulting 
comparability criteria are wider than the historical range but tighter than the clinical active substance 
specifications in use at the time.  
There were no new peaks or variants detected in any of the comparability studies.  
Results from stability comparability studies are assessed in S.7.  
In summary, it is concluded that the proposed commercial manufacturing process is representative of 
the active substance and finished product that has been used in clinical studies included in this 
application. 
Characterisation 
Sutimlimab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal anti-C1s esterase antibody expressed in CHO cells. 
Sutimlimab contains two specific mutations: serine-to-proline (S241P) to stabilise the core-hinge 
region, and leucine-to-glutamic acid mutation (L248E) to abrogate the Fcγ receptor binding. 
A comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of the sutimlimab molecule is 
presented. In general, the results show that sutimlimab has the covalent structure, post-translational 
modifications, and other characteristics of a typical humanised IgG4 antibody derived from CHO cells. 
Studies of primary, secondary and higher order structure, various physicochemical properties, 
carbohydrate structure, heterogeneity pattern and biological functions were included. 
An extensive panel of state-of-the-art and orthogonal tests were applied. Characterisation methods 
and preparations of variants for characterisation studies are sufficiently described. All peaks are 
defined and relevant chromatograms, electropherograms and spectras with sufficient resolution are 
provided.  
Sutimlimab contains N-linked glycosylation at position Asn295 of each HC. The dominant forms are 
core fucosylated biantennary glycans. The proposed mechanisms of action include binding to the C1s 
esterase, thereby inhibiting further escalation of the classical complement pathway. Binding studies 
confirm that the Leu-to-Glu mutation (L248E) obviates, or significantly decrease, binding to Fcγ 
receptors. In summary, except for a recommendation to the approval, the submitted information 
regarding characterisation of the active substance is acceptable and demonstrates a sufficient product 
understanding. The monosaccharide profile is currently missing. The Applicant is recommended to 
update section 3.2.S.3.1 with the missing monosaccharide profile within 6 months from approval. This 
is listed as Recommendation 1. 
Active substance product-related and process-related impurities, respectively, are described together 
with the analytical methods for control. All peaks are defined and relevant chromatograms, 
electropherograms and spectras are provided. Amounts of the process-related impurities are measured 
and calculated (assuming a worst-case scenario) to be well below safety limits and clearance can be 
considered sufficiently demonstrated.  
Assessment report

Sufficient information is provided regarding impurities. 
Specification 
Specifications 
The commercial release and stability specifications for BIVV009 active substance include control of 
identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests and are adequately justified.  
Active substance release and stability (end-of-shelf life) specifications are presented.  
The proposed list of attributes is considered suitable.  
The specifications were developed in accordance with ICH Guideline Q6B, for most parts. The approach 
takes future variability into account by including assay and process variability, while guidelines (ICH 
Q6B) expect justifications based on variability during clinical trials and process validation. However, as 
the active substance specification in the end is adapted to clinically justified criteria in the finished 
product end-of-shelf life and release specifications, the proposed active substance specification is 
considered approvable. 
In conclusion, the proposed active substance specification is considered approvable. 
Analytical procedures 
Descriptions were provided for all analytical procedures. Most of the methods described in this part are 
used for testing of both active substance and finished product.  
The non-compendial analytical procedures are generally described with a sufficient level of detail. 
Representative chromatograms, electropherograms, and dose-response curves are provided.  
Compendial procedures have been appropriately verified for their intended use. 
The non-compendial procedures applicable to control of both active substance and finished product 
have been appropriately validated. The validations were performed in accordance with the 
requirements in ICH Q2(R1). Successful execution of the method verification and method transfer 
protocols is demonstrated for most parts. 
Reference standards 
A two-tiered system of primary and working reference standard is applied. The selection, preparation, 
qualification, and re-qualification of reference standards have been described in sufficient detail, 
including specifications and characterisation testing. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release results, and batch usage overview, for three manufacturing versions of the active 
substance lots are provided. Further batch genealogy is presented in 3.2.S.2.6. 
Each batch was tested to the specification in place at the time of manufacture. All limits were met.  
Container closure

and CoAs and acceptable specifications.  
Stability 
A shelf life for sutimlimab active substance of 21 months at the recommended long-term storage 
condition of 5 ± 3 °C is proposed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 17/135 
 
 
 
The subjects covered by the description of the stability studies (recommended, accelerated and 
stressed conditions, and forced degradation) and the stability data are appropriate, in compliance with 
ICH Q1A(R2) and Q5C, and the chosen analytical methods appear adequately stability indicating.  
The submitted data is considered supportive of the proposed shelf life and long-term storage conditions 
(21 months at 5 ± 3 °C). 
Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The BIVV009 finished product is a sterile solution for intravenous (IV) infusion in a single-dose vial. 
Packs of 1 or 6 vials are proposed.  
The qualitative and quantitative composition of the BIVV009 has been provided . All excipients in the 
composition comply with the Ph. Eur. or USP grade (USP grade tested to closely related chemicals 
available as Ph. Eur.). No novel excipients and no human or animal derived materials are used. 
Each single-use vial contains a nominal volume of 22 mL of 50 mg/mL BIVV009 (1100 mg 
BIVV009/vial). An overfill volume of 1.0 mL is included to allow for withdrawal of the labelled amount 
of 22 mL bringing the target fill volume to 23.0 mL. No overages are applied.  
The vials and stoppers are compliant with appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs for primary containers and 
closures as described in section P.7. 
Formulation development 
All BIVV009 finished products manufactured during development are sterile solutions intended for 
intravenous (IV) administration. The study designs, results and chosen buffer components are found 
acceptable. A commercial formulation of 50 mg/mL BIVV009 in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM 
sodium chloride, 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 80, pH 6.1 was selected. 
In-use time and dilution/compatibility stability of BIVV009 finished product was studied. Finished 
product was diluted with normal saline in IV bags and infused through an IV set with in-line filter. It 
was demonstrated that the IV infusion bag could be stored for up to 8 hours at ambient temperature 
(20–25°C) and with room light conditions if not used immediately. From a microbiological point, 
appropriate text from NfG on maximum shelf life for sterile products for human use after first opening 
or following reconstitution (CPMP/QWP/159/96 corr.) is included in the SmPC. 
Manufacturing process development 
Active substance batch, finished product dosage form, manufacturer, location, finished product lot and 
allocation of lots are listed. 
Process development studies have been performed to optimise the processing conditions and confirm 
equipment suitability, including at-scale studies supporting the manufacture of finished product 
BIVV009 50 mg/mL vial on the filling line. The product CQAs are determined at the level of the active 
substance. Process characterisation studies on the manufacturing process were performed. 
Compatibility of product with contacting materials was tested. Hold times and storage conditions were 
confirmed. Extractable volume was confirmed as well as effectiveness of crimp pressure for the 
container closure system. 
Nomenclature and definitions with rationales for process controls and control strategy is presented as 
well as a list of process controls. The controls and tests are assessed as adequate and justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 18/135 
 
 
 
Container closure 
Extractable and leachable (E&L) assessments of the primary packaging components and the key 
product-contact materials associated with the filling lines were performed. The levels of any potential 
leachable or extractable compound were considerably lower than the Analytical Evaluation Threshold 
and do not pose a toxicological safety concern for the finished product. No elemental impurity above 
the ICH Q3D limits for parenteral compounds was detected in the course of the leachable study. The 
container closure system is considered suitable for use. An acceptable approach is in place to ensure 
microbial safety. 
Compatibility 
An in-use stability/compatibility study was performed. The results of the refrigerated hold study 
demonstrated that finished product diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride at concentrations between 13 to 
50 mg/mL (undiluted) can be stored at 2-8ºC for up to 72 hours prior to infusion.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
All sites involved in manufacture control and storage of the finished product operate in accordance with 
EU GMP. 
The manufacturing process is of standard type with pooling, mixing, bioburden reduction, sterile 
filtration, filling and capping, however the active substance is not frozen. Batch formula both in volume 
and weight is provided with minimum and maximum batch sizes. 
All product contacting equipment and materials, single use or as dedicated equipment, are listed. 
Equipment used for sterilisation is identified with conditions for sterilisation and specifications/limits. 
Vials are depyrogenated, the stoppers are autoclaved and used equipment is identified. Sterilisations 
are performed.  
Maximum hold and processing times with temperature requirements are defined as are shipping 
conditions for subsequent finished product vial labelling and secondary packaging. No reprocessing has 
been suggested for the finished product manufacture. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The nomenclature and definitions for process controls and control strategy with categories and 
attributes are explained and defined. The definitions for control strategy are found acceptable. 
Process operations with parameters and ranges are presented with criticality classifications. CPPs are 
listed together with acceptance criteria and control methods for critical IPCs, critical in-process tests as 
well as the key-controlled parameters and critical-controlled parameters. The overall control strategy, 
with process parameters and IPCs are found adequate leading to consistent finished product quality. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The Applicant describes the process validation with pooling and mixing of finished product followed by 
bioburden reduction and in-line sterile filtration. Homogeneity of filling, subvisible particle verification, 
visual inspection, yields and container closure verification with capping validation was performed. 
Validation also included hold times and the aseptic process by media fill, sterilising filters with bacterial 
filter retention tests, integrity testing and compatibility, bacterial challenge studies and 
extractable/leachable as well as shipping studies. 
Consecutive lots were included in the process qualification and the finished product manufacturing 
process is considered validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 19/135 
 
 
 
Overall, the finished product manufacturing process is considered validated. 
Product specification 
Specifications 
The commercial release and stability specifications for BIVV009 finished product include control of 
identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. 
The proposed list of attributes is considered suitable. Polysorbate 80 is included in both the release and 
stability specification which is endorsed. A justification for routine batch release and stability testing is 
presented. Specifications for the active substance release, active substance end of shelf life, and 
finished product release are adjusted to assure that the clinically justified finished product limits can be 
met during the entire shelf life. 
Analytical methods 
Short descriptions of the analytical procedures and validation/qualification reports are provided. 
The methods common for the active substance and finished product are described in the active 
substance section. Specific tests for the finished product are appearance-visible particles, sub-visible 
particulates, extractable volume, polysorbate 80, sterility, endotoxin and container closure integrity. 
The methods specific to the finished product are validated with exception for the compendial methods 
that are verified.  
Reference standard 
The reference standards used for testing of the BIVV009 finished product are the same as those used 
for testing of the active substance. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis release data have been provided for all batches manufactured (preclinical, clinical and 
PPQ). 
All test results  including lots released to the clinic met the release specification in place at time of 
testing.  
Characterisation of impurities 
Product-related impurities are the same as those present or potentially present in BIVV009 active 
substance except for sub-visible particles.  
The level of specific elemental impurities was assessed following ICH Q3D.The results were for all 
elements tested below the control threshold (30% of the PDE), thus not posing any risk. The risk 
assessment carried out for BIVV009 indicates that the finished product complies with ICH Q3D 
requirements. A risk assessment on the potential presence of nitrosamines was performed on the 
BIVV009 finished product manufacturing process. The assessment includes potential sources of 
nitrosamines and their potential chemically related substances entering the final commercial finished 
product. The Applicant concluded that due to the design of the manufacturing process as well as the 
quality systems applied, there is no risk of release or potential release of nitrosamines into the finished 
product during production. This is endorsed. 
Stability of the product 
A claim is made for 2 years shelf life for the finished product when stored at 2°C to 8°C, as stated in 
the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 20/135 
 
 
 
The stability program with tests and test interval is in line with ICH Q5C and found acceptable. 
The requested shelf life is based on primary and supportive stability studies from lots manufactured 
throughout development. 
Photostability was studied with the conclusion that prolonged light exposure should be avoided, to 
protect from light and store in the original carton as stated in the SmPC. Temperature cycling and time 
out of refrigeration with post-cycling long-term stability storage was performed. Studies determined 
that this did affect the ability of BIVV009 finished product to conform to the final proposed commercial 
stability specifications. This is acceptable. 
Testing for leachables is  ongoing on long term storage. The in-use stability and compatibility portion 
of the in-use study will be repeated on an end of shelf life finished product lot stored at 5 ± 3°C, which 
is acceptable. A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment for long-term storage 
condition of 5±3 °C has been provided. Overall, the shelf life of 2 years at 2°C to 8°C protected from 
light is acceptable. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 16 hours at 18°C to 25°C or for 72 
hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If 
not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user and would not normally be for longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8 °C or 8 hours at room 
temperature, unless vial opening and pooling into the infusion bag has taken place in controlled and 
validated aseptic conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agents safety testing is stated to be according to ICH Q5A. Testing on cell banks and 
EEOPCB is sufficiently described and in line with ICH Q5A. 
Unprocessed bulk harvest is tested for mycoplasma and adventitious viruses.  
There are no animal-derived raw materials used in the manufacture of BIVV009 active substance. 
During early development of the CHO-M host cell line, materials of animal origin were used. A 
Certificate of Analysis and Certificate of Suitability are provided. The materials were trypsin of porcine 
origin, cod liver oil, ovine cholesterol and FBS heat inactivated. Some ancillary materials (e.g., bags, 
tubes, and filters) used in the process were manufactured using bovine tallow derivatives as lubricants 
and/or release agents. All bovine tallow derivatives were TSE compliant in line with EMA/410/01. 
Virus clearance studies are in line with expectations and have been performed using qualified scale-
down models The suitability of the scaled-down models has been sufficiently demonstrated. An 
appropriate panel of model viruses is used. Four viruses were chosen for the BIVV009 virus clearance 
validation study: Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (X-MuLV), Minute Mouse Virus (MMV), Porcine 
Pseudorabies Virus (PRV) and Reovirus Type 3 (Reo3). 
Chromatography parameters such as resin type, column bed height, diameter, loading, linear flow rate, 
elution end of collection and resin lifetime were compared side-by-side. Differences were essentially in 
column sizes, linear flow rates were kept within range. 
Any cytotoxic or viral infectivity interference of process buffers on the cell lines used for the virus assay 
was evaluated prior virus validation studies. Also, potential effect on a unit operation from the virus 
formulation matrix on performance when virus is spiked into the feed-stream was tested. 
The summary of clearance validation results only add up the lowest obtained values which is endorsed 
being a conservative approach. The overall clearance values and viral safety of the process is 
acceptable. The retrovirus safety margin for retrovirus like particles found in the bulk harvests by TEM 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

is sufficient and acceptable. In summary, the characterisation and control of the cell substrates, the 
use of non-animal derived materials in the process, in-process testing and virus clearance capability of 
the manufacturing process provides sufficient assurance of safety regarding adventitious agents in the 
BIVV009 process. 
Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The dossier is of good quality.  
Characterisation of sutimlimab was performed using an extensive panel of appropriate methods. 
A science- and risk-based approach with QbD elements was used for process development and process 
characterisation, supporting the proposed manufacturing process control strategy and demonstrating a 
solid process understanding. The active substance and finished product manufacturing processes and 
process controls are appropriately described and the processes are appropriately validated. 
Four versions of the active substance manufacturing process are presented. Changes are clearly 
described. Comparability between process versions is demonstrated. It is concluded that active 
substance manufactured with the commercial process version is representative of the active substance 
used in clinical trials. 
The claimed stability for the active substance of 21 months at 2°C to 8°C, and for finished product of 2 
years at 2°C to 8°C is considered acceptable based on the provided stability data. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Enjaymo is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Enjaymo is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends several points for investigation.

2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The pharmacology, drug disposition, and nonclinical safety profile of sutimlimab were evaluated in 
support of the use of sutimlimab for conditions in which the classical complement pathway plays an 
important role in the pathophysiology such as CAD, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), bullous 
pemphigoid (BP) and other indications in which CP activation is induced by pathogenic patient 
autoantibodies.    
The nonclinical toxicology program was claimed to be consistent with the Guidance for Industry:  
S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (2012). The nonclinical 
toxicology program was claimed to be conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as 
appropriate. 
Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology studies were performed to assess sutimlimab and/or TNT003 binding affinity to 
human (and other species) C1s and to determine the specificity and potency of sutimlimab inhibition of 
CP activity. Additionally, in vitro studies with samples from CAD, ITP and BP patients were performed 
to assess the ability of sutimlimab to inhibit complement fragment deposition on human RBCs, 
platelets and skin.  
The affinity of mouse antibody TNT003 and 12 humanized variants to active and inactive forms of 
human C1s was determined using biolayer interferometry. All variants bound C1s with higher affinity 
than the parental mouse antibody, TNT003. The humanized lead antibody (TNT009, variant VH4Nk2) 
bound active and inactive C1s with an affinity of 2.624 x 10-10 M and 2.616 x 10-10 M respectively. 
The in vitro pharmacology of sutimlimab (TNT009) was evaluated using both sutimlimab and TNT003. 
Using normal human serum (NHS) or human CP proteins in vitro, sutimlimab was shown to have high 
affinity (10-10 M) and specificity for human C1s and to be a potent (IC50 of 10-9 M) and complete 
(100%) inhibitor of serum CP activity but not of the alternative pathway or lectin pathway (AP or LP, 
respectively) activity. Cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) was the only pharmacologically 
relevant species identified, as the binding affinity for C1s (10-10 M) and the pharmacologic activity of 
sutimlimab in this species are identical to those for humans. TNT003 IC50 values for inhibition of CP 
activity were 14.7 and 15.6 μg/mL in 80% human and monkey serum, respectively. 
As was observed in vitro, sutimlimab displayed a steep threshold concentration-response curve; in vivo 
this resulted in rapid loss of CP inhibition when the serum sutimlimab concentration declined below the 
threshold concentration.  
TNT003 was demonstrated in vitro to inhibit: CA-mediated C3 fragment opsonization of human RBCs, 
erythrophagocytosis of C3 fragment-opsonized RBCs, CA-mediated hemolysis; CAmediated production 
of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) in CAD patient samples and C1q, C3b, C4d, and C5b-9 deposition 
on platelets with ITP patient samples. In addition, TNT003 was demonstrated to inhibit complement C3 
fragment deposition, mediated by auto-antibodies from patients with BP, at the dermal-epidermal 
junction of human skin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 23/135 
 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies of autoimmunity 
In vitro autoimmunity studies demonstrated that TNT003 does not inhibit C1q deposition on early 
apoptotic cells (EACs). Furthermore, TNT003 does not inhibit the desirable immunosuppressive effects 
of efferocytosis of EACs. 
Effect of C1s inhibition on bacterial killing 
To evaluate the risk of Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections when inhibiting 
the classical pathway studies were performed with another well characterized and specific inhibitor of 
C1s, the mouse monoclonal antibody TNT005. TNT005 specifically inhibits the protease activity of C1s 
and achieves complete inhibition of the CP at concentrations like those of sutimlimab in vitro. The data 
suggest that killing of N. meningitidis or S. pneumoniae in whole blood containing specific anti-capsular 
antibodies is unimpeded by inhibition of the CP. Meningococcal and pneumococcal capsular conjugate 
vaccines which may mitigate risk of these infections in patients receiving C1s inhibitors.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted with sutimlimab. Instead, safety 
pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the 5- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
monkeys. No secondary PD effects related to AP activity were observed in the 5-week GLP repeat-dose 
toxicity study in monkeys. No sutimlimab-related central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular or 
respiratory safety pharmacology effects were noted for the parameters evaluated in the 5- and 26-
week GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with sutimlimab. Please see Clinical 
pharmacology section for more detail. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) exposure parameters of sutimlimab have been 
characterized in single- and multiple-dose cynomolgus monkey studies over the same dose range as 
the pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, 5 to 180 mg/kg. After an IV dose of sutimlimab Cmax are observed 
at the end of infusion, increasing with increasing dose. The exposure, as determined by the AUC, was 
dose-proportional at doses ≤45 mg/kg; a greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure was 
observed for doses above 45 mg/kg. The t1/2 of serum sutimlimab appears to be concentration 
dependent. At 30 mg/kg, the t1/2 was approximately 18 to 25 hours. When the dose is doubled from 30 
to 60 mg/kg, the mean t1/2 increased to 50 hours. 
No specific studies were done to assess the distribution of sutimlimab. Sutimlimab is a humanized IgG4 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to be administered intravenously. It is anticipated to be present 
within the vasculature (blood and plasma) and interstitial and extracellular fluids throughout the body, 
as evidenced by the low volume of distribution in vivo. No tissue distribution, protein binding, or 
placental transfer studies have been conducted. No formal metabolism studies were conducted with 
sutimlimab. As a large protein, sutimlimab is expected to be metabolized by non-saturable proteolytic 
catabolism processes. As these pathways of degradation are generally well understood, classical 
biotransformation studies are generally not needed (ICH S6[R1]). Small peptides and individual amino 
acids generated during the metabolism of biologics such as sutimlimab are excreted and/or re-
incorporated into new protein production via normal metabolic pathways. As these pathways of 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

excretion and re-incorporation are generally well understood, classical excretion studies are generally 
not needed and have not been performed for sutimlimab. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies 
have not been conducted with sutimlimab. As monoclonal antibodies are generally highly target 
specific and do not interact with the protein/enzymatic systems responsible for the metabolism of small 
molecule drugs, drug interactions are not anticipated to occur. 
Toxicology 
A limited toxicology program with sutimlimab has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement 
with relevant guidelines.  
The toxicity profile of has been characterized in cynomolgus monkeys via GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
toxicity studies for up to 6 months and in an enhanced pre-and postnatal development (ePPND) 
toxicology study with a 3-month postnatal evaluation. Evaluation of safety pharmacology parameters 
on CNS, respiration and cardiovascular endpoints were included in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. The 
repeat-dose toxicology studies and the ePPND study also included TK analysis and evaluation of 
immunogenic potential of sutimlimab, and the risk for autoimmunity and circulating immune 
complexes. Furthermore, a human tissue cross-reactivity study has been conducted. 
The intravenous route of administration was utilized in the repeated toxicology studies and the 
enhanced pre and postnatal study to match the intended clinical administration route. 
Relevance of selected species 
The choice of cynomolgus monkey as the toxicology species, was based upon comparable binding 
affinity to human C1 and the functional cross-reactivity to inhibit CP-mediated haemolysis of antibody-
sensitized red blood cells (RBCs) in humans. In other species tested (mice, rats, rabbits, minipigs and 
dogs) no binding to C1 and/or no inhibition of CP-mediated haemolysis in serum occurred. Based on 
binding and functional properties of sutimlimab, the selection of cynomolgus species as the only 
relevant toxicology species is supported. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with sutimlimab. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Sutimlimab has been evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkey for 5 (up to 100 
mg/kg/week) and 26 weeks (up to 180 mg/kg/week) with 8 weeks of recovery. In addition, as part of 
the studies evaluation of inhibition of classical component pathway was evaluated. Further, blood 
samples from animals in these monkeys was evaluated for autoimmunity and the levels of circulating 
immune complexes in non-GLP compliant studies (TN-1501). 
In both the 5- and 26-weeks studies no mortality, clinical signs, effects on body weight, food 
consumption, body temperature or clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis) or any histopathological findings were observed.  
In the 5-week study, inhibition of serum CP was noted at 30 mg/kg/week, however, sustained high 
inhibition during 5- weeks of treatment of sutimlimab was observed at 60 and 100 mg/kg/week. After 
a recovery period of 8 days at 100 mg/kg/week, the CP levels remained reduced in males and females 
(13% and 50% of controls, respectively) that was return to normal reference range (81.9-126.2%) 
after 15 days of recovery. In the 26-week study, the activity of the complement system for each dose 
level is at the same level at the pre-dose sampling; however, the activity of the complement system is 
significantly inhibited even at the pre-dose sampling at day 29 for the highest dose level. In recovery

animals administered 60 or 180 mg/kg/week, serum CP activity returned to baseline values by Days 
197 or 232, respectively. No inhibition of alternative complement pathway (AP) was not observed in 
the studies.  
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed in the repeat toxicology studies and the ePPND study. In the 5-
weeks study, there was no significant difference in exposure between genders. Over-proportional AUC0-
145 exposure and accumulation at 100 mg/kg/week were seen. 
In the 26-weeks toxicity study, the applicant concludes that no sex differences in sutimlimab Cmax and 
AUC0-48.5 were present. As a consequence, the results and discussion were based on combined sex 
values. This in not completely agreed. There are data points (60 mg/kg/week: dose 13 show a 
decrease in exposure in females vs. males in AUC0-48.5 and Cmax with a 2.6-fold and 2.4-fold change, 
respectively; 180 mg/kg/week: dose 26 show a decrease in exposure in females vs. males in AUC0-48.5 
with a 2.0-fold), thus sex-dependent PK is indicated. In the same study, the company concludes that 
exposure to sutimlimab increased with the increase in dose level from 60 to 180 mg/kg/dose and that 
this increase (mean Cmax and AUC0-48.5 values) was roughly dose proportional on Days 1, 29, 85, 
and 176. This claimed dose-proportionality is not agreed as the data rather point at a more than dose 
proportional relationship. Accumulation was observed following multiple doses. 
In dams in the e-PPND study an overproportioned AUC and Cmax exposure was seen at day 48 and 146 
pc and an approximately 2-fold accumulation at the 180 kg/mg/week dose. No exposure was observed 
in the F1 infants. 
Safety pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated in the 5- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicology studies 
in monkeys dosed up to 180 mg/kg/week sutimlimab administered IV. 
The endpoints included clinical CNS and respiratory daily examinations, physical weekly examinations, 
neurobehavioral examinations, and heart rate or ECG evaluations. 
No treatment-related CNS clinical signs or body temperature effects, changes in heart rate or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters or respiratory clinical signs or changes in respiratory rate was 
observed in any of the animals in the repeat-dose toxicology studies. 
Exposure margins 
The proposed clinical dose of sutimlimab in humans is 6.5 grams (> 39kg and <(<75kg) and 7.5 
grams (≥75kg) administrated weekly for the first two doses followed by every two weeks dosing 
thereafter. In CAD populations this results in an exposure to sutimlimab of mean AUC of 74290 
µg*h/mL (using the population PK model) and mean Cmax of 3370 µg/mL at the 6.5 grams dose. 
The proposed NOAELs in the general toxicity studies and the ePPND study were set to the highest dose 
(100 mg/kg/week in the 5-weeks study and 180 mg/kg/week in the 26-week and ePPND studies). In 
these studies, the AUC and Cmax exposure was approximately 3 to 7.7-fold and 0.9 to 4.4-fold, 
respectively, at the proposed NOAELs. It can be concluded that at the current NOAELs the margins 
ranged from no to modest margins to the proposed clinical exposure.  
Genotoxicity 
Sutimlimab is a recombinant protein made up entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains 
no inorganic linkers, synthetic organic linkers or other non-protein portions.  Therefore, sutimlimab 
would not react directly with DNA or other chromosomal material and no genotoxicity studies have 
been conducted. This is in line with the ICH S6 (R1).

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which was justified by that the high molecular weight of 
monoclonal antibodies, such as sutimlimab, cause a low risk for a genetic damage to patients. 
The applicant has performed a weight-of-evidence assessment of carcinogenic potential of sutimlimab. 
The non-clinical part of this assessment included a review of published literature regarding the 
inhibition of C1s of the classical complement pathway and its relationship to tumour development, as 
well as analysis of pertinent data obtained from non-clinical toxicology studies with sutimlimab.  
In the repeated toxicology studies, no signs of treatment related neoplastic proliferative lesions were 
found. In the 5 weeks study hyperplastic changes that involved the thyroid tissue and fibrotic changes 
at the infusion site were observed. In the 26 weeks study testicle-, epididymis-, seminal vesicle- and 
prostate weights (% of total weight) with increased exposure to test article was observed (see 
discussion). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and embryonal development 
The applicant has not conducted a fertility and early embryonic study as the male and female 
reproduction organs were stated to be evaluated in the repeated toxicology studies. Such an approach 
is in line with ICH S5.  
Enhanced pre and postnatal study 
An enhanced pre- and postnatal development study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. No 
sutimlimab-related effects on maternal parameters at doses up to 180 mg/kg/week given from day 20 
p.c. to day 146 p.c. (parturition). Pregnancy loss occurred in all groups. During the first trimester 
(Days 21 through 50 p.c.) abortions occurred for one maternal control animal, three maternal animals 
administered 60 mg/kg/week, and one maternal animal administered 180 mg/kg/week and during the 
third trimester (Days 101 through 144 p.c.) one abortion occurred for a maternal animal administered 
180 mg/kg/week. In addition, stillbirths were noted for two maternal animals administered 60 
mg/kg/week. 
In F1 generation there was no sutimlimab related effects on the parameters evaluated which included 
clinical observations, neonatal muscle tone (PND28 grip strength), hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation and morphological development parameters arm length, crown-rump length, crown-heal 
length, distance between eyes, head circumference, leg length, tail comment, tail length, male and 
female anogenictal distance, thorax circumference), external abnormalities, visceral abnormalities, 
skeletal abnormalities, organ weights, macroscopic observations, and microscopic findings. 
Inhibition of serum CP was observed at 60 and 100 mg/kg/week, but not so high inhibition seen in 
females treated with the same doses in the 26-week study. After 28 days of recovery the levels 
returned pre-dose and control levels. There were no inhibition of serum CP observed in infants. 
No change markers of autoimmune risk (anti-dsDNA IgG, anti-ENA IgG) in maternal and infant 
animals. No change of levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC-C1q) was recorded maternal 
animals. However, analysis of CIC-C1q in infants is inconclusive based on too low number of samples 
with measurable CIC-C1q. 
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the general toxicity studies. In these studies, sutimlimab was 
formulated in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% polysorbate 80, pH 6.1 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 27/135 
 
 
 
administrated by 30-minute IV infusion at doses of up to 180 mg/kg/week for a duration of up to 26-
weeks (26 doses). No local irritation was observed in neither studies. 
Immunogenicity 
Evaluation of ADA was recorded in blood sample of animals in the 5- and 26-weeks repeated toxicity 
studies and in maternal and infant animals in the ePPND study.  
In the 5-weeks study, ADA was observed in 2 males and 1 female at 30 mg/kg/week and in 1 female 
at 60 mg/kg/week but not at 100 mg/kg/week. A decrease of serum concentrations of sutimlimab was 
recorded in these animals. In the 26-weeks study, all animals had ADA titers ≤10 prior to dosing. All 
values at all time points remained ≤10 for animals administered the vehicle control article (0 
mg/kg/dose), with the exception of a titer of 50 in one male (Animal I10642) on the last day of 
recovery (Day 232). TNT009 was not detected in control animals at any time point. Two animals 
administered 60 mg/kg/dose (Animal I10644, male and Animal I10658, female) and one female 
administered 180 mg/kg/dose (Animal I10665), first observed on Day 57, displayed ADA titers >50. In 
these three animals, ADA titers were typically elevated prior to weekly dosing and subsequently 
reduced at 5 minutes after dosing, consistent with the binding of serum ADA to the IV-administered 
TNT009. ADA returned to titers of ≤10 in all recovery animals. 
In the ePPND study, presence of ADA was seen in maternal and infant animals in the vehicle control 
group. The titer values for most animals was ≤10 but in few animals the titer values was 50. In 
maternal and infant animals in sutimlimab-dosed groups also in most animals the ADA titer values was 
≤50. Higher titer values were observed in few maternal animals, along with their respective infants, 
which ranged from 250 to 31300 in maternal animals and from 10 to 625 in infants at Day 146 pc. 
Nearly 20-fold lower AUC0-48.5 exposure was noted in one maternal animal which was excluded from 
the TK analysis on p.c. day 146. Overall, sutimlimab was minimally immunogenic. 
Immunotoxicity 
In non-GLP studies evaluation of autoimmunity in terms of anti-dsDNA IgG, anti-ENA IgG, and of levels 
of circulating immune complexes was recorded in blood sample of animals in the 5- and 26-weeks 
repeated toxicity studies and in maternal and infant animals in the ePPND study. Additionally, in a non-
GLP study the immunogenic potential of sutimlimab was profiled for potential neutralizing or cross-
reacting immune responses in patients using a T cell proliferation assay with human blood.  
In the 5-weeks study, no change of markers of autoimmune risk (anti-dsDNA IgG, anti-ENA IgG) was 
recorded in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 60 and 100 mg/kg/week with sutimlimab. In the 26-
week study, serum anti-ENA reactivity was observed in a similar incidence comparing controls to 
animals in exposure groups; 9 of 10 subjects in controls and 8 of 10 or 9 of 10 animals receiving 60 or 
180 mg/kg TNT009, respectively, showed reactivity over the course of the study. Thus, there were no 
TNT009-related effects on serum anti-ENA IgG levels. No change of autoimmune parameters (anti-
dsDNA IgG, anti-ENA IgG) in maternal and infant animals were recorded. 
No change in levels of serum CIC-C1q was recorded in the 5-weeks study were animals dosed up to 
100 mg/kg/week with sutimlimab. In the 26-week study, serum CIC-C1q reactivity was observed in 2 
of 10 or 1 of 10 animals administered 60 or 180 mg/kg/dose TNT009, respectively, over the course of 
the study. The incidence and relative concentrations of CIC-C1q reactivity was similar among animals 
administered the vehicle control article or TNT009, with no evidence of a dose-related effect. Thus, no 
TNT009-related effects were noted on serum CIC-C1q levels. No change of levels of circulating immune 
complexes (CIC-C1q) was recorded maternal animals. However, the analysis of CIC-C1q in infants is 
inconclusive based on too low number of samples with measurable CIC-C1q. 
Tissue cross-reactivity  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 28/135 
 
 
 
A TCR study was performed with sutimlimab using a full panel normal tissues from 3 human donors. 
Sutimlimab showed an expected staining pattern in human tissue line with other complement proteins. 
There was no obvious cross-reactivity staining to un-intended target(s). Cytoplasmic staining 
represents no significant toxicologic risk since there is a limited ability of a therapeutic antibody to 
access the cytoplasmic compartment in vivo. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies have been conducted. The applicant has submitted an ERA with a justification for the 
absences of studies since sutimlimab is recombinant monoclonal antibody and as such do not pose a 
risk to the environment. This is accepted since monoclonal antibodies such as sutimlimab are most 
likely catabolized to individual amino acids and/or small peptides by endogenous proteases and high 
molecular weight prevents intact urinary excretion. As such, excretion of active drug is not expected. 
For these reasons, exposure to concentrations of sutimlimab in the environment does not pose any 
concern. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Sutimlimab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to and inhibits the classical complement pathway 
specific serine protease, complement component 1, s subcomponent (C1s).  
Sutimlimab and/or TNT003 were demonstrated in vitro to inhibit the following: 
•    CA-mediated complement C3 fragment opsonization of human RBCs, subsequent 
erythrophagocytosis of fragment-opsonized RBCs, CA-mediated RBC hemolysis, and CA-mediated 
production of anaphylatoxins generated by the cleavage of complement C3a, C4a, and C5a 
•    Deposition of C1q, C3b, C4d, and C5b-9 on platelets in ITP patient samples 
•    Deposition of C3d at the dermal epidermal junction of normal human skin mediated by 
autoantibodies from patients with BP 
•    HLA antibody-mediated C3d deposition on HLA-coated microbeads or HLA-mismatched aortic 
endothelial cells and splenic lymphocytes. 
Collectively, these results suggest that sutimlimab has the potential to inhibit both extravascular and 
intravascular hemolysis in CAD. 
In vitro autoimmunity studies demonstrated that TNT003 does not inhibit C1q deposition on early 
apoptotic cells. Furthermore, TNT003 does not inhibit the desirable immunosuppressive effects of 
efferocytosis of EACs. These results suggest that sutimlimab has the potential to preserve C1q 
deposition and efferocytosis of EACs in patients with CP-mediated disorders, thus mitigating the risk of 
autoimmunity that is observed in individuals with genetic deficiencies of the CP. 
Complement is required for clearance of pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae. An experiment was performed in whole blood, to which N. meningitidis was added, with 
or without anti-capsular antibodies to N. meningitidis. The classical pathway (CP) is inhibited by Ab 
TNT005, and the alternative pathway (AP) by α-Bb. These results imply that a functioning complement 
system is required for effective pathogen killing, since even in the presence of anti-capsular antibodies, 
inhibition of the complete system results in reduced killing. It appears that the CP plays the most 
important role, since inhibition of the AP has no effect on killing. However, when CP is inhibited, the AP 
does appear to take over but the presence of antibodies is required for effective killing. The conclusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 29/135 
 
 
 
by the Applicant that inhibition of CP does not prevent killing of N. meningitidis by whole blood 
containing specific anti-meningococcal antibodies is endorsed.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of sutimlimab is typical of most mAbs, with dose-dependent Cmax values following the end of 
the infusion, followed by sustained exposure. In cynomolgus monkeys, sutimlimab profiles after IV 
administration exhibited a typically high Cmax followed by rapid clearance at low doses (≤30 mg/kg) 
and a more sustained terminal exposure at higher doses with slower systemic clearance. Sutimlimab 
exposure parameters, Cmax and AUC, were dose-proportional at relatively low doses (≤45 mg/kg), but 
at higher doses sutimlimab exhibited a greater than dose-proportional exposure (Cmax and AUC). The 
t1/2 of serum sutimlimab appears to be concentration dependent. At 30 mg/kg, the t1/2 was 
approximately 18 to 25 hours. When the dose is doubled from 30 to 60 mg/kg, the mean t1/2 increased 
to 50 hours. 
Target-mediated elimination is believed to have a greater impact on the PK of sutimlimab at lower 
doses (≤30 mg/kg) than on that at higher doses (>30 mg/kg), where the concentration of sutimlimab 
exceeded that of circulating C1s and saturation of systemic target-mediated CL mechanisms appeared 
to occur. This observation occurs when sutimlimab concentrations are above 100 μg/mL. The apparent 
Vz of sutimlimab generally decreased with increasing dose and was consistent with low tissue 
distribution and primary presence in the systemic circulation. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of sutimlimab has been tested in 5- and 26-weeks repeat-dose studies and an ePPND 
study in cynomolgus monkey at doses up to 180 mg/kg/week. Overall, sutimlimab was well-tolerated 
and no adverse effects or findings was observed in most of the parameters evaluated that also 
included immunogenicity, autoimmunity, and effects of levels of circulating immune complexes. 
In the repeated toxicology studies, no signs of treatment related neoplastic proliferative lesions were 
found. In the 5 weeks study hyperplastic changes that involved the thyroid tissue and fibrotic changes 
at the infusion site were observed. However, the applicant claims that these lesions are not treatment-
related since they were observed also in control animals and was related to the treatment procedure 
and not seen in the 26 weeks study. Further, in the 5- and 26 w repeated toxicology studies the 
applicant claim that no signs of impaired immune surveillance or suppression observed. However, as 
noted in the 26 weeks study testicle-, epididymis-, seminal vesicle- and prostate weights (% of total 
weight) with increased exposure to test article were observed. This may indicate neoplastic or 
hyperplastic changes in male reproduction organs. The Applicant argued that this is a sign of an overall 
indication of early sexual maturity. This is agreed but cannot be regarded as evidence that 
complementary inhibition by sutimlimab does not have the potential to increase testicular 
with/advance sexual development. However, based on the totality of data, it seems less likely that 
sutimlimab would enhance sexual development and is the cause of the increase in testicular weight; it 
seems more likely to be a cause of a heterogeneity in pubertal onset based on the age that the 
monkeys had during investigations. 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted. The applicant claims that there is no support of a causal 
mechanistic/target-related link between Cls inhibition and increased cancer risk based on 3 
publications. For example, Wang et al. 2002 found a relationship between increased presence of 
various complement factor H molecules and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The applicant did not 
consider this observation as toxicologically relevant to the question whether sutimlimab is pro-
tumorigenic since H molecules are involved in the function of the alternative pathway of the 
complement system and not the classical pathway that to be targeted by sutimlimab. Sakai et al 1994 
evaluated the tumorigenicity of BALB/c fibroblast A31 cells transfected with hamster complement C1s 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 30/135 
 
 
 
cDNA. Non-transfected BALB fibroblast A31 cells do not produce C1s, while normal C1s production by 
transfected cells was observed. When the transfected cells were administered to BALB/c nu/nu mice, 
the C1s cDNA transfectants formed tumours whereas BALB/c A31 and A31 mice transfected with only 
the vector did not. Tumours derived from the C1s cDNA transfectant showed invasive growth. 
Furthermore, the Applicant states that no publications showed that suppression of the classical 
complement system has the potential to increase the risk of tumour development in participants with 
complement disease. 
In conclusion, the weight-of-evidence assessment of carcinogenic potential of sutimlimab that included 
a literature review of published literature regarding the inhibition of C1s of the classical complement 
pathway and its relationship to tumour development has been provided and is acceptable. The 
applicant’s claim that the weight-of-evidence assessment of carcinogenic potential was done in line 
with the ICH S6 (R1) and that it showed a low cancerogenic risk of sutimlimab is accepted.   
A fertility and early embryonic study were not performed. A detailed qualitative microscopic evaluation 
of the reproduction organs of males and females in the repeat-dose toxicity studies has been 
conducted. Due to sexual immaturity of male animals, examination of the spermatogenic cycle was not 
conducted. Therefore, effects on male fertility remain unknown for sutimlimab. This has been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Although male reproduction organs have not been fully evaluated it seems likely that there is a low risk 
for sutimlimab related effects on reproductive function since 1) short term studies did not suggest 
(immediate) toxicity; 2) there is no evidence of a relationship between inhibition of complement and 
male and female sex hormones in the studies; 3) there is no clear evidence of sutimlimab-related 
enhancement of sexual maturity but rather the changes reflex heterogeneity in pubertal onset based 
on the age of the subjects in the study; and 4) a thorough literature review does not suggest that 
inhibition of complement would adversely affect reproductive capacity. In the ePPND study in 
cynomolgus monkeys, pregnancy loss occurred in all groups and stillbirths were noted for two maternal 
animals administered 60 mg/kg/week. The incidences of abortions and stillbirths in test article-treated 
groups were within the normal range based on historical control data and were considered not 
attributable to the test article.  
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of sutimlimab was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in the general toxicology program. 
This program is considered sufficient. Single- and multiple dose pharmacokinetics has been evaluated 
in the cynomolgus monkey. 
A limited toxicology program with sutimlimab has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement 
with relevant guidelines. Overall, the toxicology program has shown that there is no major toxicological 
risk after sutimlimab administration. The section 5.3 of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
reflects the preclinical safety data.

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology database for sutimlimab (also called BIVV009; TNT009) is based on two 
phase-3 studies with sparse PK-sampling and 3 phase-1 studies with rich PK-sampling. 
Methods 
Quantification of sutimlimab in serum  
A direct ELISA was developed to measure the free and partially bound sutimlimab (ie, sutimlimab with 
1 or both binding sites available to interact with the target, C1s). The first version of this ELISA 
method (TN-1608/1609) detected sutimlimab in serum and was performed for study BIVV009-01 Parts 
A-C. The assay was further optimized with a switch to analysing sutimlimab in plasma to increase 
stability. This assay (TN-1702) was used for studies TNT009-02, BIVV009-05, BIVV009-01 (Part E), 
BIVV009-03, and BIVV009-04. Due to interference of endogenous C1s in the plasma matrix calibration 
standards were prepared in buffer. Accuracy and precision of the assay during the conduct of method 
validation was determined by evaluating the performance of the assay controls prepared in both assay 
buffer (Buffer QCs) and normal human plasma (Matrix QCs). The validated range is between 5-133 
ng/ml. 
Detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
An electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay was developed to detect anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs) directed against sutimlimab. A 3-tiered approach was employed. The method was 
optimized in three steps to improve drug tolerance.  
The third method (ABV0020) included both prior Melon Gel extraction and acid dissociation which led 
to an acceptable drug tolerance. This method was used for the two phase-3 studies as well as BIV009-
01 part E. Screening and confirmatory cut-points were determined using 54 individual drug-naïve 
complement preserved human serum sample lots. 
Given the overall low incidence of treatment-emergent anti-sutimlimab antibodies in the clinical study 
(4 subjects of 44 in the phase-3 studies) no assay for determining the neutralising potential of ADAs 
were developed. The effect of ADAs on sutimlimab PK and PD was assessed by comparing plasma 
concentration time profiles or PD-profiles of sutimlimab for each patient with treatment-emergent ADA 
to that of ADA negatives. Further, no subjects with confirmed treatment-emergent positive ADAs 
(treatment-boosted or treatment-induced) had treatment-emergent adverse events concerning 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions associated with sutimlimab. 
Pharmacodynamic assays 
Commercially available assays were validated for CP and AP activity measurement. Complement C4 
and CH50 measurements were done by using commercially available IVD assays. For C1sC1INH, an 
exploratory research assay was used. C1q and free C1s measurements were completed using 
exploratory research assays. Validation reports have been provided for all methods (also for 
commercially available kits). 
Non-compartment data analysis (NCA) 
Standard non-compartment analysis was performed where rich sampling was applied.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The pharmacokinetic analysis using a population PK modelling approach was conducted in three steps 
as more data became available. An initial population PK analysis of sutimlimab was performed using 
data from two Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and patients with CP-mediated diseases (study 
BIVV009-01 Parts A/B/C and study BIVV009-02), including CAD, to establish the base model (with 
limited covariate assessment) and to select the doses for BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04 (study TNTH 
CSC 103, briefly described below). Additional studies that were subsequently completed (BIVV009-01 
Part E, studies BIVV009-05 and BIVV009-03 Part A) were included in the population PK analysis in 
study POH0755 (report containing the final population PK model, described below), which was a 
continuation of the previous model development and covariate model development. As additional data 
became available from studies BIVV009-03 Part B and BIVV009 04 Part A population PK analysis was 
conducted using the maximum a priori (MAP) Bayesian approach (study POH0797), based on the 
previously established model in study POH0755 which was considered final after initial assessment of 
its ability to predict the phase 3 data. These analyses were based on prespecified plans. 
POH0755 
The main objectives of the analysis were to describe the population PK of sutimlimab and to explore 
demographic and laboratory values that may affect the PK of sutimlimab in patients with CAD. The 
secondary objective of the analysis was to assess the PK differences between Japanese and non-
Japanese subjects. Dense PK data from 3 Phase 1 studies and sparse PK data from the Phase 3 study, 
totalling 154 subjects (including 34 CAD patients), were pooled for this analysis. Sutimlimab was 
administered as a 1-hour IV infusion as a single dose (0.3 to 100 mg/kg) or as repeated doses (30 to 
75 mg/kg or 6.5 g [patients <75 kg]/7.5 g [patients ≥75 kg]), either once every week or 2 doses 1 
week apart followed by Q2W doses.  
The final population PK model for BIVV009 following intravenous administration is a 2-compartment 
disposition model with parallel linear and non-linear CL terms. Body weight was identified as a 
covariate on Vc and CL. Ethnicity (Japanese) was included as a covariate on Vc and Vmax. After 
including the body weight and Japanese subject covariates, the following covariates did not have an 
additional impact on the PK of sutimlimab: sex, race, age, albumin, hepatic function (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin), renal function (creatinine 
clearance [CRCL], eGFR), and immunogenicity (presence/absence of ADAs).

Absorption  
Absorption data are not available since all studies administered sutimlimab as an IV infusion. No food 
effect study was conducted. 
Bioequivalence 
No human bioequivalence studies were performed to demonstrate comparability between the 
formulations/processes used during the clinical development program of sutimlimab, see quality part of 
AR for assessment of comparability. 
Distribution 
As typical for monoclonal antibodies, it is distributed primarily in the circulatory system as illustrated 
by the small volume of distribution, of 5.8 L (sum of central and peripheral volumes of distribution) 
based on population PK analysis. No protein-binding assays have been performed. 
Elimination 
The excretion and metabolic pathways of sutimlimab has not been investigated. As an IgG4 antibody, 
the biotransformation of sutimlimab is expected to be similar to endogenous IgG (degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and subject to similar elimination pathways. For a 
147 kDa protein renal excretion is not anticipated. 
Sutimlimab CL is governed by 2 parallel elimination pathways: a nonlinear, target mediated pathway 
predominating at low concentrations and a nonspecific, linear pathway predominating at higher 
concentrations. The half-life of sutimlimab is dependent on the plasma concentration. The elimination 
half-life of sutimlimab at steady-state based on the total clearance (linear and non-linear clearance) is 
16 days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) was apparent at single low doses, less than 30 mg/kg (~ 2 
g), resulting in a greater than dose-proportional increase in sutimlimab exposure (AUC0-168 h) up to 
30 mg/kg. Between doses of 60 and 100 mg/kg of sutimlimab TMDD was saturated with resulting dose 
proportional increases in exposure. 
Steady state was achieved by week 7 after starting sutimlimab treatment, with accumulation ratio of 
1.5-1.8.

Variations in renal and hepatic function or drug-metabolizing enzymes are not expected to affect the 
elimination of sutimlimab. No dedicated formal intrinsic factor PK studies has been conducted. 
Demographic factors and the effect of organ dysfunction was investigated in the population PK 
analysis. Body weight and ethnicity (Japanese versus non-Japanese) influenced the pharmacokinetics 
of sutimlimab. Lower exposure was observed in subjects with higher body weight and was considered 
clinically relevant. The effect of body weight on pharmacokinetics has been integrated in the

recommended dose regimen tiered by body weight. Although a higher exposure (44 % higher Cmax 
and >20% higher AUC) was observed in Japanese subjects compared to the non-Japanese subjects, 
the differences were not considered clinically significant. 
Sutimlimab was not studied in children and is not intended for use in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed with sutimlimab. In clinical samples from 
the Cardinal study the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were shown to be decreased by almost half by 
sutimlimab. This demonstrates that sutimlimab acts as an immunomodulator and affects cytokines 
known to affect CYP expression in CAD patients, e.g. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Sutimlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) of directed against human complement factor 
C1s, a serine protease, that together with sub-component q (C1q) and another serine protease, sub-
component r (C1r), forms the C1 complex, the first component of the classical pathway of the 
complement system. It specifically binds to C1s of humans and non-human primates. It has no affinity 
for the related proteases of the lectin pathway, mannose-associated serine protease (MASP)-1 and 
MASP-2. Sutimlimab has shown disease-relevant inhibitory activity against classic complement 
pathway (CP) in a variety of human in vitro models of human disease (including cold CAD, bullous 
pemphigoid, and warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology development program of sutimlimab comprises of 3 clinical studies providing 
pharmacodynamic data on CP activity, dose selection and immunogenicity: a first-in-human SAD/MAD 
study in healthy subjects (BIVV009-01 parts A and B), and in patients with CP mediated disorders 
(part C), a phase 1 dose confirmation study in healthy subjects (BIVV009-02), and a SAD/MAD and a 
multiple dose study in healthy Japanese subjects (BIVV009 05). Additionally, PD results were collected 
in both phase 3 studies (BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04) as detailed in the efficacy part of this report.  
Classical complement pathway (CP) activity 
Levels of CP activity, CH50, C1s (target of sutimlimab), C4 (first soluble cleavable substrate of C1s) 
measured, as well as levels of C1sC1INH to confirm the binding of sutimlimab. Further, C1q was 
measured in all studies to confirm that the non-enzymatic role of C1q is left intact by sutimlimab. 
Study BIVV009-01, the first-in-human, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study tested single dose of sutimlimab infusion over 1 hour escalating from 0.3 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg 
(Part A, 36 on sutimlimab and 12 on placebo), and multiple doses of 30 or 60 mg/kg (Part B) or 
placebo once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks in healthy volunteer. After a single dose of 30 mg/kg or 
higher, the inhibition of serum CP activity and the decrease of free C1s and C1sC1INH concentration 
reached a maximum effect. This inhibition was reversible as levels returned to baseline after 7 days, 
with the duration of inhibition increasing in a dose-dependent manner. Return to baseline was more 
prolonged with increasing dose. With multiple dosing with 30 and 60 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks 
similar findings were noted as seen in the SAD study with nearly complete inhibition of mean CP 
activity, C1s, and C1sC1INH concentration profiles. After discontinuation, a partial return to baseline 
was noted after 7 days with 30 mg/kg, while a nearly complete knockdown was observed over the 
entire study duration for the 60 mg/kg group. Total C4 levels were not affected and C1q changes from

baseline in 30 and 60 mg/kg groups were comparable to those seen in the placebo subjects, in whom 
little to no effect on CCP activity was seen.  
Study BIVV009-02, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study (n = 24, randomized 
3:1 for sutimlimab: placebo), evaluated multiple doses of sutimlimab at 75 mg/kg in healthy subjects 
on Days 1, 8, 22, and 36. The findings of the study confirmed the findings in the earlier MAD study 
BIVV009-01 (Part B). An inhibition of >90% of CP, CH50, C1s, and C1sC1INH activity was shown 
throughout the treatment period, and was maintained up to 2 weeks after the final dose on Day 36. A 
small and no clinically relevant effect has been observed on the C1q and C4 levels.  
Study BIVV009-05 was a Phase 1 PK/PD study in 12 Japanese healthy subjects. Part A examined 3 
different single doses (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg) of sutimlimab. Part B examined 2 different multiple 
doses of sutimlimab (6.5 g for body weight (BW) <75 kg and 7.5 g for BW ≥75 kg) on Days 1, 8, and 
22. Also here, the CCP activity was immediately and effectively inhibited up to >90% at all dose levels 
in both Parts A and B. Dose-related differences in the duration of CP activity were observed, with 
increased doses resulting in longer durations of CP inhibition. C1q and C4 levels were only slightly 
affected, as also seen in the previous studies. 
SAD/MAD evaluation in patients with complement-mediated disorders 
Part C of the first-in-human study BIVV009-01 was a non-randomized multiple-dose study in 24 
patients with complement-mediated disorders including CAD, WAIHA, BP, and active AMR in patients 
who had received a kidney transplant. Patients received a single dose of 10 mg/kg (day 0), followed by 
4 weekly doses of 60 mg/kg (day 1, 8, 15, 22). Although there was a difference in baseline levels of CP 
activity across patient population, the mean CP activity and C1s concentrations displayed nearly 
complete inhibition over the entire profile across all patient populations and was maintained 3 weeks 
after the last weekly 60 mg/kg dose. The effects on the C1q levels were small and not clinically 
relevant. Important to note were the C4 levels in CAD patients. They were below the normal range 
(<0.18 g/L) at baseline. The C4 levels restored immediately after receiving the first weekly dose of 60 
mg/kg, but then returned to the pre-treatment level 4 weeks after the last 60 mg/kg dose. 
Sub-study E was a long-term extension study where four of the CAD-patients from sub-study C was 
followed. Some PD-data are presented as an interim analysis and presented in the efficacy part of this 
report. 
Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)  
An updated analysis (POH0798) was conducted with the objectives to characterize and quantify the 
exposure-response relationship of sutimlimab and assess the impact of covariates on it by developing a 
PK-PD model for Hgb as the primary efficacy parameter, and to characterize the relationships between 
exposure and response, including graphical evaluation of PD markers bilirubin and C4. No discussion of 
analysis of exposure-safety was presented (see discussion).  
The analysis was performed through:  
- graphical exploration of biomarkers (Hgb, bilirubin, and C4), including an exploratory characterization 
of the exposure-response relationship between the maximum observed change in biomarker from 
baseline and maximum Cmin;  
- development of a dynamic population PK-PD model for Hgb; and  
- simulations to illustrate the PK-PD relationship of Hgb and to investigate the impact of PK covariates 
on the PK-PD relationship for Hgb.

CAD subjects from study BIVV009-01 part C were included in part E, and subjects from BIVV009-03 
part A were included in BIVV009-03 part B, resulting in a total of 72 subjects included in the analysis. 
In total, 25% of the patients were males and 69.5% presented impaired renal function (based on 
CLCR), the proportion of patients who received placebo was around 28% (20 subjects from study 
BIVV009-04 part A). The subjects received either 5.5, 6.5 or 7.5 g of sutimlimab.  
Hgb model 
A dynamic model was developed by integrating a turnover model for Hgb (to capture the delay in PD 
effect in relation to plasma concentration) with an Emax model (to capture the drug effect) relating the 
Hgb
elevating effect of sutimlimab to its plasma exposure at time t. The PK component consisted of the 
final population PK model for sutimlimab. The individual PK parameters predicted from the PK model 
‐
were used to inform the PD response. Selection of an indirect response model was supported by 
hysteresis plots for time-matched observed Hgb versus observed sutimlimab concentrations supporting 
the selection of an indirect response model. The current model does not contain a placebo effect, which 
is in line with the lack of time-dependent changes observed during the exploratory analysis.  
Covariate analysis was performed at the level of the base model (combined structural and statistical 
model). PD parameters with identified interindividual variability (IIV) were further investigated. ADA 
and disease status were not taken into account, while blood transfusion was additionally included in 
the list of covariates to be tested. Among the known correlation of CLCR with body weight and age, 
there is also a correlation of baseline Hgb levels with CLCR and bilirubin. The parameters were 
estimated with an RSE < 50%. The magnitude of ETA shrinkage on the IIVs was ≤ 30% for all PD 
parameters with IIV terms. The adequacy of the model to describe the data in placebo patients 
supports the absence of a placebo model.  
The model estimated the turnover time of 188 hours with a derived median k out of 0.0053 h−1, which 
corresponds to a half-life of 5.4 days. This half-life is lower than the lifetime of Hgb (
 120 days), but 
reflects its higher degradation rate in CAD patients. The drug effect was estimated to have an Emax of 
∼
25% and the EC50 as 155 μg/mL, which is similar to the parameters obtained with the prior 
descriptive models. The additive residual unknown variability was 0.92 g/dL and reflects circadian 
variation of Hgb levels over the course of the study, which was not specifically accounted for in the 
model and probably at least partially explains the oscillations observed in some patients. After stepwise 
covariate modeling, only CLCR and blood transfusion, which explained 12.2% and 16.5% of the IIV in 
Ebase and Emax, respectively, were kept in the model. Patients receiving at least one blood transfusion 
during the study showed a lowering of Emax of 40%. Solely in patients undergoing blood transfusion 
inter-individual variability was under-predicted by the model. This is probably because occurrence of 
transfusion was incorporated as a binominal covariate which did not consider neither the number of 
transfusions nor the time during treatment when transfusion occurred.

Exploratory exposure-response modelling for Hgb, bilirubin and C4 
The characterization of the exposure-response relationship between the maximum observed 
change in biomarker from baseline and maximum Cmin irrespective of time was performed using an 
Emax model with hill coefficient fixed to 1. For each biomarker, two models were run: one with and one 
without priors for ECmin50. The prior for ECmin50 was defined to be the 90% CI for Hgb EC50 
estimated in the population analysis.  
Exploratory exposure-response relationship characterization was limited without priors due to low 
number of observations at lower concentrations. Therefore, Hgb EC50 confidence interval from 
population exposure-response analysis was used as prior to estimate parameters for exploratory 
exposure-response relationship of change in Hgb, bilirubin, and C4 from baseline. Because maximum 
change in biomarkers was used for this analysis, estimated E0 (baseline change in biomarker) was 
higher than zero for Hgb and C4 and lower than zero for bilirubin. Estimated Emax captured maximum 
observed effect on biomarker.  
Graphical exploration of the data 
The median (2.5 - 97.5%) data for biomarker levels (with correction for baseline) over time in studies 
903 and 904 are presented in Figure 5. After baseline correction, effect on Hgb, C4 and bilirubin levels

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Enjaymo is indicated for CAD, an orphan disease. The clinical pharmacology database for sutimlimab is 
thus rather limited but comprises all PK and PD data collected from 118 healthy subjects (96 on 
sutimlimab), including Japanese subjects and 72 patients with primary CAD. The distribution,

metabolism, and excretion characteristics of sutimlimab are mainly based on popPK model-estimated 
parameters. No dose adjustments for special populations are proposed in the SmPC and the PK-
information is mainly descriptive. 
Sutimlimab (also called BIVV009; TNT009), is a first-in-class, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
which is expressed by recombinant in CHO cells. No human bioequivalence studies were performed to 
demonstrate comparability between the formulations/processes used during the clinical development 
program of sutimlimab. Comparability has been shown in vitro, see discussion in quality section. 
A direct ELISA was developed to measure the free and partially bound sutimlimab (ie, sutimlimab with 
1 or both binding sites available to interact with the target, C1s) initially in serum but the method was 
further developed to detect sutimlimab in plasma (by a different CRO). The initial bioanalytical method 
(TN-1608/1609) used for study BIVV009-01 Parts A-C, that is the SAD and MAD in healthy volunteers 
as well as the MAD in patients with different complement-mediated disorder, was considered not fully 
validated. None of the provided validation-data indicated that the method was not appropriate, 
however, several aspects of the validation process described in the EMA guideline on bioanalytical 
method validation had not been evaluated resulting in an Other Concern atOC day 120. of the 
procedure. In the response to this question, the Applicant compared the serum and plasma 
concentrations using non-compartmental analysis and popPK analysis. There are limitations in the 
analysis but assessing the totality of data it can be agreed that the bioanalytical method is fit for the 
purpose of characterising the exposure in patients with CAD given doses ≥60 mg/kg. As the population 
PK results are supportive to the clinical data, the BIVV009-01 study Part A, B and C data can be 
included in the popPK model. 
The second bioanalytical method (TN1702) detected sutimlimab in plasma, and in the validation 
process complement preserved plasma was used as matrix, however due to interference of 
endogenous C1s in this human matrix, calibration standards and some QC-samples were prepared in 
buffer. The calibration curve, prepared in buffer, gives information on total concentration of sutimlimab 
as all sutimlimab is unbound in buffer due to the absence of interference of endogenous C1s or other 
potentially interfering factors present in plasma. There are also QC-samples prepared in buffer which 
have been included in all analytical runs. However, some QCs (matrix-QCs) and study samples are in 
another matrix (plasma) and give information on partially bound and free sutimlimab. It is thus 
expected that matrix-QCs may not give the same result as their nominal concentration (i.e. what was 
spiked in the sample) as target is present in plasma. During the validation process, an “actual nominal 
concentration” is determined for the matrix-QCs, i.e. the concentration of partially bound or free 
sutimlimab. This is expected to differ more strongly at low concentrations, due to the binding to target. 
Then CV% is calculated as usual from the determined “actual nominal concentration”. In the analysis 
of study samples, the actual nominal concentrations of matrix QCs are determined in each run, where 
n=6. 
Also for TN17-02 there are deviations from the validation process described in the EMA guideline. 
Accuracy and precision were only successfully evaluated in 4 runs instead of 6. Selectivity and 
specificity were not evaluated using matrix-based LLOQ and ULOQ (although these levels were 
evaluated with buffer QCs) but with M-HQC (spiked to 100 ng/ml after MRD) and M-LQC1 (spiked to 20 
ng/ml after MRD). This could be an issue defining LLOQ which is only evaluated with buffer-samples. In 
the clinical studies few samples were below the limit of quantification (BQL), in the popPK model these 
samples are set as missing which is considered appropriate (setting these to e.g. half LLOQ would have 
been more problematic in this case). An acceptable justification for not performing a parallelism 
investigation has been provided by the Applicant. Overall, it is considered that the Applicant has made 
attempts to address the issues with developing a bioanalytical method for sutimlimab and the method 
is sufficiently validated and appropriate for its purpose.

ADAs were detected by a 3-tier electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay. Which has been 
optimized and revalidated 3 times (by different CROs) during the clinical program due to issues with 
drug tolerance and target interference. Only the last assay (ABV0020) used in clinical studies BIV009-
01 (part E), BIV009-03 and 04 has shown an acceptable drug tolerance. Overall, this assay appears 
adequately validated, the assay is acceptably selective and sensitive, capable of detecting low levels 
antibodies at 5.5 ng/ml. As the assay used for the phase-3 trials is appropriately validated information 
regarding immunogenicity in the target population is considered acceptable. Given the low incidence of 
ADAs in the phase-3 trials and that no impact of ADAs on PK/PD has been detected, issues with the 
early assays are not further pursued. The low incidence of ADAs and the different analyses of the effect 
of ADAs on sutimlimab’s PK, PD and safety also justifies that no Nab-assay has been developed.  
The volume of distribution at steady state in central and peripheral compartments was approximately 
5.8 L in patients with CAD (SmPC section 5.2). 
Sutimlimab CL showed a steep initial decrease at doses less than 30 mg/kg (~total dose of 2000 mg or 
2 g), before becoming relatively stable between 60 and 100 mg/kg, resulting in a greater than dose-
proportional increase in sutimlimab exposure (AUC0-168 h) up to 30 mg/kg (single dose) and ~60 
mg/kg (multiple dose). In the SmPC (section 5.2) it is claimed that sutimlimab concentrations above 
100 µg/mL resulted in maximal CP inhibition. Non-clinical data indicate that complete CP inhibition 
occurs at sutimlimab levels above 20 µg/mL. The limit 100 µg/mL is chosen as the concentration where 
target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is not predominant. As no dose adjustments are proposed 
based on drug monitoring (e.g. non-responders are not proposed to have drug levels determined and if 
shown low an increase in dose) the information is not of great importance.  
Sutimlimab CL is governed by 2 parallel elimination pathways and the half-life of sutimlimab is 
dependent on the plasma concentration. The elimination half-life of sutimlimab at steady-state based 
on the total clearance (linear and non-linear clearance) is 16 days. In the range of observed 
sutimlimab concentrations achieved over the dosing interval at the therapeutic dose in Cardinal and 
Cadenza studies, non-linear clearance represents 36 % of total clearance while linear clearance 
represents 64 % of total clearance. The protein binding, excretion and metabolic pathways of 
sutimlimab has not been investigated. This is acceptable for an IgG antibody. 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of sutimlimab in special 
populations, which is considered acceptable for a monoclonal antibody. Special populations were 
evaluated as covariates in the popPK analysis, see discussion below.  
No drug interaction studies have been performed. At Day 120 a discussion of how CAD as disease 
affects cytokine levels and if this will be altered by sutimlimab treatment leading to a potential for 
DDIs was requested. The Applicant has provided an article discussing in vitro data generated using a 
mouse version of sutimlimab. However, when searching PubMed another publication (Weitz IC et al. 
Blood, vol 136, 2020) was retrieved in which patient samples from the Cardinal study had been 
evaluated for IL-6 and IL-10 levels, showing a relevant decrease in cytokine levels by sutimlimab. A 
DDI study investigating the clinical relevance of this interaction mechanism would have been of 
interest. However, the SmPC section 4.5 has been updated to include a warning indicating potential for 
CYP/transporter mediated drug interaction (SmPC section 4.5). 
Population PK 
The pharmacokinetic analysis using a population PK modelling approach was conducted in three steps 
as more data became available. An initial population PK analysis of sutimlimab was performed using 
data from two Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and patients with CP-mediated diseases (study 
BIVV009-01 Parts A/B/C and study BIVV009-02), including CAD, to establish the base model (with 
limited covariate assessment) and to select the doses for BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04 (study TNTH

CSC 103). Additional studies that were subsequently completed (BIVV009-01 Part E, studies BIVV009-
05 and BIVV009-03 Part A) were included in the population PK analysis in study POH0755, which was a 
continuation of the previous model development and covariate model development, and a final 
population PK model was developed based on these data. As additional data became available from 
studies BIVV009-03 Part B and BIVV009 04 Part-A population PK analysis was conducted using the 
maximum a priori (MAP) Bayesian approach (study POH0797). The methods for evaluation and 
qualification of models are acceptable. In the second round of assessment additional patient data from 
study 904 were included in the dataset, also evaluated using the maximum a priori (MAP) Bayesian 
approach (report POH0951). 
The final population PK model for BIVV009 (study POH0755) following intravenous administration is a 
2-compartment disposition model with parallel linear and non-linear CL terms. BSV terms are included 
on CL, Vc, Vp, and Vmax. Separate residual error models were employed for BIVV009-03 study and 
the other 3 studies (TNT009-01, TNT009-02, and BIVV009-05). Due to the small number of BLQ 
samples (7.6% of all post-dose PK observations), and the quality of the base model fit, the M3 method 
was not explored. Body weight was identified as a covariate on Vc and CL. Ethnicity (Japanese) was 
included as a covariate on Vc and Vmax. After including the body weight and Japanese subject 
covariates, the following covariates did not have an additional impact on the PK of sutimlimab: sex, 
race, age, albumin, hepatic function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST], bilirubin), renal function (creatinine clearance [CRCL], eGFR), and immunogenicity 
(presence/absence of ADAs).  
The main objective was to describe the PK in patients with CAD, however a pcVPC showing how well 
the model describes the observed concentration in patients with CAD has not been presented. Overall, 
the model appears to capture most of observed concentrations over time. The shrinkage on CL is very 
high, probably due to the estimation of a non-linear component of the elimination model resulting in a 
higher-than-expected uncertainty in the linear elimination parameter. The goodness-of-fit plots do not 
indicate any major model misspecifications.  
When data from studies BIVV009-03 Part B and BIVV009 04 Part A became available, population PK 
analysis was conducted using the maximum a priori (MAP) Bayesian approach (study POH0797). 
However, the model used for this comparison included the covariate age on Vc (model 1538180), while 
the final model in report 0755 does not as this covariate was considered to not have high clinical 
impact and was removed. As the differences in model and model parameters are relatively small, the 
results are accepted. Goodness-of-fit plots stratified on study indicate that the model does not capture 
the Cmax for study 904. However, overall, the model appears to capture the data. Separate residual 
error models were used for study BIVV009-03 due to the large difference in observed concentration 
between steady-state dosing (BIVV009-03) and single- or multiple-dose studies. With the additional 
data from the Phase 3 study 904, the applicant evaluated the model using MAP. The pcVPCs indicate 
that the model can adequately describe the Phase 3 data from study BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04. 
However, the model overpredicts exposure in Japanese subjects, therefore, the model output and 
simulation should not be used to draw conclusions on exposure in this population. Therefore, a PK 
exposure metric derived directly from the observed data (i.e. non-model-based approach) is used to 
describe the increased exposures in Japanese subjects in the SmPC. It appears that transfusion has a 
relatively modest effect on predicted PK parameters. In addition, predicted Cmin exposures are 
generally above 100 µg/mL. A simulation of the re-initiation of the dosing regimen as described in the 
SmPC was provided. Predicted concentration-time profiles in case a dose is missed is largely 
overlapping with the situation where doses are administered according to protocol. Also, no large 
increases in Cmax concentrations are observed after re-initiation of the dosing schedule. This is 
considered acceptable.

Pharmacodynamics 
The 3 clinical phase 1 studies provided PD data on CP activity, dose selection and immunogenicity. 
Additionally, PD results were collected in both phase 3 studies (CADENZA and CARDINAL trials). 
Classical complement pathway (CP) activity 
CP activity, CH50, C1s (target of sutimlimab), C4 (first soluble cleavable substrate of C1s) levels, as 
well as levels of C1sC1INH were measured to confirm the binding of sutimlimab. Further, to confirm 
that the non-enzymatic role of C1q is left intact by sutimlimab, C1q was measured in all studies. 
Single doses (study BIVV009-01) of sutimlimab escalating from 0.3 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg showed that 
after 30 mg/kg or higher, inhibition of serum CP activity and the decrease of free C1s and C1sC1INH 
concentrations reached maximum effect. The duration of inhibition increased in a dose-dependent 
manner. This inhibition was reversible as levels returned to baseline after 7 days. Return to baseline 
was more prolonged as the dose level increased. After multiple doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg once weekly 
for 4 weeks similar findings were noted with nearly complete inhibition of mean CP activity, C1s, and 
C1sC1INH concentration profiles. After discontinuation, a partial return to baseline was noted after 7 
days with 30 mg/kg, while a nearly complete knockdown was observed over the entire study duration 
for the 60 mg/kg dose. The effect was of nearly the same magnitude for both doses. Total C4 levels 
were not affected and also C1q changes from baseline in 30 and 60 mg/kg groups were comparable to 
those seen in the placebo subjects, in whom little to no effect on CP activity was seen. Multiple dosing 
of sutimlimab at 75 mg/kg in healthy subjects on Days 1, 8, 22, and 36 (Study BIVV009-02) confirmed 
the findings of study BIVV009-01 (Part B), showing an inhibition of >90% of CP, CH50, C1s, and 
C1sC1INH activity which was maintained up to 2 weeks after the final dose. In line with the 
mechanism of action of sutimlimab, a small and no clinically relevant effect has been observed on the 
C1q and C4 levels. Similar effects were noted with 3 different single doses (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg) 
and 2 different multiple doses of sutimlimab (6.5 g for body weight (BW) <75 kg and 7.5 g for BW ≥75 
kg) on Days 1, 8, and 22 in Japanese healthy subjects (Study BIVV009-05). 
SAD/MAD evaluation in patients with complement-mediated disorders 
In patients with complement-mediated disorders including CAD, WAIHA, BP, and active AMR in patients 
who had received a kidney transplant (Part C of the first-in-human study BIVV009-01), a single dose 
of 10 mg/kg (day 0), followed by 4 weekly doses of 60 mg/kg, the mean CP activity and C1s 
concentrations displayed nearly complete inhibition over the entire profile across all patient 
populations, and was maintained 3 weeks after the last weekly 60 mg/kg dose. The effects on the C1q 
levels were small and not clinically relevant. Important to note that C4 levels in CAD patients were 
below the normal range (<0.18 g/L) at baseline but restored immediately after receiving the first 
weekly dose of 60 mg/kg, but then returned to the pre-treatment level 4 weeks after the last 60 
mg/kg dose. 
Of note, a thorough QT/QTc study was considered not needed, given the nature of the drug molecule, 
as this concerns a monoclonal antibody. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Two exposure-response analyses were conducted as more data became available. An initial analysis 
(POH0756) was performed using data from Studies BIVV009-01 part C (also known as TNT009-01 part 
C) and BIVV009-03 Part A with the objectives to describe the exposure-efficacy response of BIVV009 
with regards to Hgb and bilirubin level, and to explore the demographic and laboratory values that may 
affect the safety profile of BIVV009 therapy and model, if necessary. It was concluded that information 
on AEs were sparse and therefore no exposure-safety analysis was conducted. As additional data from 
studies BIVV009-01 part E, BIVV009-03 part B, and BIVV009-04 Part A became available an updated

analysis (POH0798) was conducted with the objectives to characterize and quantify the exposure-
response relationship of sutimlimab and assess the impact of covariates on it by developing a PK-PD 
model for Hgb as the primary efficacy parameter, and to characterize the relationships between 
exposure and response, including graphical evaluation of PD markers bilirubin and C4. As the same 
data were included in the updated analysis as in the initial one, only results from the latter were 
presented in depth.   
A dynamic population PK-PD model for Hgb was developed by linking the complete time profile of 
sutimlimab concentrations to the time-profiles of Hgb. The RSE was high for EC50 and on the impact of 
the covariates blood transfusion on Emax and baseline CRCL on Ebase (baseline effect). It is also high on 
the estimates inter-individual variabilities, however, the introduction of covariates on Ebase and Emax 
reduced the IIV of these parameters by 12.2% and 16.5%, respectively. The magnitude of ETA 
shrinkage on the IIVs was ≤ 30% for all PD parameters with IIV terms. In general, observations are 
randomly distributed around the identity line in the goodness-of-fit plots, however, it is noted that the 
low haemoglobin measures are not captured on a population level by the model (GOF only displayed 
for subjects receiving sutimlimab). This is also visible in the VPC where the lower prediction interval 
does not capture all observations over time. The model appears to adequately predict the median 
change in haemoglobin with and without treatment (i.e. change in haemoglobin over time with placebo 
treatment).   
The applicant conducted an exploratory exposure-response modelling for the relationship between 
maximum observed change from baseline in Hbg, bilirubin and C4 and maximum Cmin using an Emax 
model with hill coefficient fixed to 1. The uncertainty in EC50/IC50 is high for all biomarker models. 
The exploratory modelling exercise is of little value as the biomarker measure is detached from actual 
Cmin-value at time point of measurement and a conclusion of efficacy cannot be made based on these 
models. The figures of the observed biomarker measurements with correction for baseline versus time, 
stratified on study and doses do not indicate a major difference in efficacy between the doses on a 
population level. For study 903, the higher dose appears to result in slightly higher change from 
baseline initially for haemoglobin. However, in the 904 study it is noticed that the median for the 7.5 g 
dose, and the 2.5th percentile, is lower at later time points. The trend is not clearly observed for the 
median bilirubin, or C4, however the lower percentiles appear to go lower for the 7.5 g group 
indicating a lower change from baseline for some subjects who received the higher dose. Exposure-
safety analysis was conducted using all available data for Cardinal and Cadenza studies, with the 
adverse events plotted against predicted sutimlimab exposure quartiles for AUC and Cmax. Each quartile 
includes 16-17 subjects. A trend is observed towards higher GI disorders with an increased Cmax, and 
general disorders and administration site conditions for AUC and Cmax. However, in general, there does 
not appear to a clear trend between the other adverse events and high exposure. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical results of the abovementioned clinical pharmacology programme is sufficient for the 
proposed dose range and regimen of 6,500 mg for patients weighing 39-<75 kg and 7,500 mg for 
patients weighing ≥75 kg. This dosing regimen demonstrated an appropriate effect on CP activity, and 
on anaemia and haemolysis markers (i.e. Hb and bilirubin). Further, both doses seemed generally well-
tolerated with low immunogenicity.

Dose-response studies  
No dedicated dose response studies were conducted in patients. 
The starting dose, 0.3 mg/kg, for first-in-human study BIVV009-01 Part A was chosen to result in 
sutimlimab exposure that would be 1/300 of the exposure at the no adverse effect level in the 28-day

toxicology study in nonhuman primates. Successively higher sutimlimab doses up to 100 mg/kg 
(BIVV009-01 Part A) or 60 mg/kg once weekly (BIVV009-01 Part B) were then tested in healthy 
subjects to exceed the concentrations that produced complete CP inhibition in vitro and to maintain 
above this level for increasing duration. Based on the extremely steep PK/PD relationship of sutimlimab 
observed at concentrations 15.5 μg/mL (concentration associated with 90% reduction of CP activity, 
concentration for 90% of effect [IC90]; report TNTH-CSC-103), and the rapid clearance due to TMDD 
observed at concentrations <100 μg/mL, 60 mg/kg once weekly was chosen for subsequent 
assessment in patients with CP-mediated disorders (study BIVV009-01 Part C) to maintain CP 
inhibition throughout the dosing interval. A tiered flat-dosing approach based on body weight cut-offs 
was proposed for Phase 3 with a dose of 6.5 g for subjects <75 kg and a dose of 7.5 g for subjects 
≥75 kg. The weight cut-off of 75 kg was chosen based on the expected weight distribution in CAD 
patients. This body-weight tiered induction/maintenance dosing regimen was predicted to maintain 
target trough concentrations >100 μg/mL throughout the dosing period in approximately 94% of CAD 
subjects. 
Main studies 
BIVV009-04 (CADENZA) Part A 
A Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
sutimlimab/BIVV009 in patients with primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) without a recent history of

A 6-week Screening/Observation period was followed by randomization 1:1 to sutimlimab or placebo 
through Week 25 for Part A. Following completion of dosing in the 6-month treatment period, patients 
could continue to receive sutimlimab during Part B (long-term study). Part A is completed. An interim 
analysis of Part B has been provided at the start of the procedure.

Objectives 
The primary objective of Part A was to determine whether sutimlimab administration results in a 
≥1.5 g/dL increase in haemoglobin level and avoidance of transfusion in patients with primary CAD 
without a recent history of blood transfusion. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Rate of responders defined as patients who had a ≥1.5 g/dL increase in Hgb levels 
at the treatment assessment endpoint (TAT; defined as the mean value of Weeks 23, 25, and 26), did 
not receive a blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 and did not receive treatment for CAD 
beyond what is permitted per protocol. 
Key secondary endpoints: Change from baseline in Hgb at the TAT; Change from baseline in QOL, as 
assessed by the change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale 
scores at the TAT. 
Additional secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in markers of haemolysis. 
Sample size 
Approximately 40 patients with primary CAD who did not have a recent history of transfusion were 
randomized. It was expected that few patients would meet the composite primary endpoint without 
treatment intervention. The proposed sample size was chosen to provide sufficient power to detect a 
50% improvement in meeting primary endpoint criteria with sutimlimab treatment compared to 
placebo with a significance level of 0.05. A total of 40 patients (20 patients per group) would provide a 
statistical power of greater than 85% to detect a treatment difference of 50% for placebo response 
rates between the range of 15% to 40%. This calculation assumed a 2-sided 5%-level test comparing 
the response rates between the sutimlimab and placebo groups. A 50% improvement over placebo was 
considered clinically relevant. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
On Day 0, patients were randomized with a ratio of 1:1 to sutimlimab or Placebo by a permuted block 
randomization with a fixed block size of 4. The randomization was performed by Pharm-Olam’s 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Sponsor personnel (except for those who provide drug 
supply) were blinded to the treatment assignment until the interim analysis (Part A DBL). There was no 
stratification at randomisation. 
The study was double-blind. Sutimlimab or placebo doses for infusion were prepared by the pharmacist 
or qualified site staff in a blinded manner. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Full Analysis Set: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Intent-to-treat [ITT] population were synonymous 
and consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose (including partial dose) of IMP. 
Analyses of efficacy were performed on the FAS. 
Modified Full Analysis Set: Following the guidelines from FDA and EMA to assess any potential 
impact of COVID-19 on efficacy evaluation, a Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS) was included. The 
mFAS population was a subset of the FAS and included patients from the FAS who did not miss any 
visits or discontinue early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 52/135 
 
 
 
Per-protocol Set: The Per-protocol (PP) Set was a as a subset of FAS and included patients in the 
FAS who did not have any important protocol deviations that impacted their efficacy assessments. 
Selected efficacy endpoints were analysed for the PP Population. 
Safety Analysis Set: Patients who received at least 1 dose (including partial dose) of study drug were 
included in the Safety Analysis Set. Note that Safety Analysis Set is the same as FAS in this study. 
PK Analysis Set: Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had evaluable PK 
concentrations were included in PK Analysis Set. 
PD Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least one 
evaluable PD sample during Part A were included in the PD Analysis Set. 
Analyses of Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis was to compare the proportion of patients meeting primary endpoint 
criteria ("responder rate") in the sutimlimab treatment arm with the placebo treatment arm using the 
COVID-adjusted Composite estimand as defined in Table 4. If no patients missed both the Week 23 
and 25 study visits due to COVID-19, the primary efficacy analysis was to be performed using the 
Composite estimand. To reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference, the pooled 2-sided p-
value based on a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test had to be <0.05. The test was 
stratified by baseline haemoglobin (< median baseline haemoglobin versus ≥ median baseline 
haemoglobin) and geographic region (Japan/Australia, United States, Europe). In addition, the 
proportion of subjects who met each of the 3 response criteria as well as the number of transfusions by 
study period (before Week 5 and between Week 5 and Week 26) and by treatment arm were 
summarized. 
Table 4. COVID-adjusted Composite Estimand 
Supplementary analyses 
Four sensitivity, or rather supplementary, analyses of the primary endpoint were conducted and are 
listed below. The CMH test was used to estimate the p-values and 95% CIs for the sensitivity analyses. 
• Sensitivity Analysis 1: Analysis included no adjustment for COVID-related intercurrent events. 
• Sensitivity Analysis 2: mFAS analysis population included patients who did not miss visits or did not 
discontinue treatment early due to COVID. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 53/135 
 
 
 
 
• Sensitivity Analysis 3: Analysis included any patient who completed treatment through at least Week 
23 and had at least 1 evaluable haemoglobin value from Week 23, 25, and 26. 
• Sensitivity Analysis 4: PP population analysis excluded patients who had an important protocol 
deviation which could have potentially impacted the efficacy assessment. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint were performed by age (<65 and ≥65 years), gender 
(female/male), baseline weight (<75 kg and ≥75 kg), baseline haemoglobin level (<median, ≥median 
g/dL), previous rituximab monotherapy and/or cytotoxic therapy (yes/no), previous eculizumab 
therapy, and prior thromboembolic events within the last year. For these analyses, if the sample size in 
a category was small, the cut-off may have been modified to adjust distribution. For these subgroups, 
the CMH odds ratio and 95% CI was summarized. Where possible, the CMH estimates were stratified 
by baseline haemoglobin and geographic region. The consistency of the odds ratio among these 
subgroups was evaluated using forest plots. 
Analyses of Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints were ranked ordered by clinical importance and a sequential closed testing 
procedure was performed to protect the type I error. When tested, a sequential closed procedure with 
alpha of 0.05 for each test was performed using the hypothetical estimand in this order: (1) mean 
change from baseline in haemoglobin at the treatment assessment timepoint in the sutimlimab versus 
placebo arms and (2) mean change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score at treatment assessment 
timepoint in the sutimlimab versus placebo arms.  
The change from baseline in Hgb at the treatment assessment timepoint was analysed for the FAS. The 
primary analysis will be performed according to the Hypothetical Estimand based on the MMRM model, 
while a sensitivity analysis will be done via De-facto Estimand. Similarly, COVID-specific sensitivity 
analyses will be performed according to the Modified Hypothetical Estimand and Modified De-facto 
Estimand in order to ascertain the results for subjects unaffected by the COVID pandemic.  
Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) was used for the analysis of such endpoints at study 
visits (including the treatment assessment time points). The MMRM model will include the baseline 
value of the endpoint, visit, treatment, and treatment and visit interaction. A heterogeneous Toeplitz 
(TOEPH) covariance matrix within a subject will be used. For the endpoint at the treatment assessment 
timepoint (average of Week 23, 25, and 26), the estimate was calculated as the mean of MMRM 
estimates at Week 23, 25, and 26 visits. 
For either estimand, the mean change from baseline in Hgb at treatment assessment timepoint for 
both treatment arms, the estimated difference in change from baseline at TAT between BIVV009 and 
placebo, along with its 95% CI, was estimated by the MMRM model. The significance test for the 
treatment difference in Hgb at the treatment assessment timepoint was based on appropriate 
treatment contrast. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 54/135 
 
 
 
 
Additional sensitivity analysis based on multiple imputation was carried out for the Hypothetical 
Estimand to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumption of MAR. Specifically, multiple imputation 
was performed using a pattern-mixture model and the above MMRM model will be run on the imputed 
data. Non-monotone missing data will first be transformed to a monotone missing data structure. The 
control-based imputation method assumes subjects in the BIVV009 treatment arm who discontinued 
from the study or are missing Hgb values at the TAT will exhibit similar Hgb values to those subjects in 
the placebo arm (and subjects in the placebo arm will continue to exhibit those Hgb values). Thus, 
multiple imputation is performed using only information from the placebo arm. 
The analyses for haemoglobin described above will also be performed for the FACIT-Fatigue score.

countries with the highest enrolment were Germany (10 patients), Japan (5 patients), and the United 
States (5 patients). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 5 global amendments and 6 country-specific amendments submitted to regulatory 
authorities, none of which are considered to affect the overall study integrity. 
Major protocol deviations 
Overall, 30/42 subjects reported major protocol deviations, most frequently related to receiving 
prohibited medication (27.3% sutimlimab and 20.0% placebo), IMP administration (13.6% and 
30.0%), and study conduct (9.1% and 25.0%). Prohibited medications included rituximab 
monotherapy or rituximab combination therapies (eg, bendamustine, fludarabine, ibrutinib, or 
cytotoxic drugs). Most prohibited medication deviations were due to initiation of or dose modification of 
folate or iron (stable dosing of such medications was allowed, CHMP’s comment). Missed visits due to 
COVID-19 were not considered major protocol deviations. IMP administration deviations included 
missed crossover dose; missed loading dose; wrong filter used; dosing not done; missed Day 7 dose; 
missed dose; and 2 placebo group patients who each received a single dose of sutimlimab.

NOTE: Percentages are based on the number of subjects in each treatment arm and total of the Full Analysis Set. 
Race and ethnicity were not reported for 31 patients due to local laws. 
At baseline mean haemoglobin (SD) was 9.15 (1.05) g/dL and 9.33 (1.04) g/dL in the sutimlimab and 
placebo groups, respectively; mean total bilirubin (SD) was 41.175 (27.266) µmol/L and 35.778 
(11.822) µmol/L, respectively; mean LDH (SD) was 421.500 (194.702) U/L and 380.800 (243.111) 
U/L, respectively; haptoglobin (SD) was 0.200 (0.000) g/L and 0.207 (0.031) g/L (values <0.2 g/L 
were imputed as 0.2 g/L); and absolute reticulocytes were 159.022 × 109/L (69.636) and 145.022 × 
109/L (46.046), respectively. Mean (SD) FACIT-Fatigue score at baseline was 31.673 (12.802) and 
32.988 (10.946) in the sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively. 
No patient in either group received a transfusion within the last 6 months prior to screening. In the 
period between 6 to 12 months prior to screening, 19 (86.4%) and 20 (100%) patients in the 
sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively, received no transfusions. For the 3 patients in the 
sutimlimab group who had received prior transfusions, a mean of 1.5 units (range 1 to 2) were 
transfused. 
Medical history 
In total, 5/42 (2 in the sutimlimab group and 3 in the placebo group) had any hospitalisation related to 
CAD within the last 2 years. A haematological malignancy within the last 5 years was reported in 8/42 
patients (4 in each treatment group), all relating to lymphoproliferative disorder/lymphoma. None of 
the study subjects had any thromboembolic event within the last year; 4/42 (2 in each treatment 
group) had any previous thromboembolic event. 
More patients in the sutimlimab group had a history of low-grade/indolent lymphoid malignancy (8/22 
[36.4%] sutimlimab versus 2/20 [10.0%] placebo), with bone marrow involvement in 5 patients in the 
sutimlimab group and 2 patients in the placebo group. A history of other hematologic process was 
more prevalent in the placebo group (1 [4.5%] sutimlimab and 5 [25.0%] placebo). Of 39 patients 
who consented to testing for Gilbert’s syndrome, none were positive and 1 test result was declared 
unknown. 
Baseline CAD characteristics 
All patients reported CAD-related anaemia symptom(s) and/or specific complications of CAD within 3 
months prior to screening.

Fatigue was reported by 38/42 at day -42 and 32/42 at baseline. Weakness was reported by 23/42 at 
day -42 and 24/42 at baseline. Shortness of breath was reported by 24/42 at day -42 and 23/42 at 
baseline. Palpitations/fast heartbeat was reported by 17/42 at day -42 and 10/42 at baseline. Light-
headedness/presyncope was reported by 11/42 at day -42 and 5/42 at baseline. Chest pain was 
reported by 5/42 at day -42 and 4/42 at baseline. Acrocyanosis was reported by 21/42 at day -42 and 
13/42 at baseline. Raynaud’s syndrome was reported by 13/42 at day -42 and 8/42 at baseline. 
Haemoglobinuria was reported by 13/42 at day -42 and 10/42 at baseline. Disabling circulatory 
symptoms was reported by 5/42 at day -42 and 3/42 at baseline. Major adverse vascular event 
including thrombosis was reported by 2/42 at day -42 and 1/42 at baseline. 
Prior and/or concomitant medication 
A total of 31 (73.8%) patients had received prior CAD therapy within the last 5 years, including single 
agent therapy with rituximab (21, 50.0%), corticosteroids (20, 47.6%), combination regimen that may 
have included rituximab (6, 14.3%), or other chemotherapy (6, 14.3%). Prior CAD therapy was similar 
in the sutimlimab and placebo groups.  
All of the patients received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study. The most frequently 
used concomitant medications were anti-anaemic preparations (81.8% sutimlimab and 80.0% 
placebo), vaccines (68.2% and 30.0%), analgesics (36.4% and 35.0%), drugs for acid (reflux) related 
disorders (36.4% and 35.0%), antibacterials for systemic use (27.3% and 40.0%), antithrombotic 
agents (22.7% and 30.0%), and mineral supplements (0% and 50.0%). One patient in the sutimlimab 
group received a prohibited CAD medication (rituximab). This patient discontinued study treatment 
prematurely due to an AE and started rituximab treatment during the 9-week post-treatment follow up 
period. 
In the previous 5 years or during the study, all patients received at least one meningococcal 
(conjugate) vaccine and at least one Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine. Nineteen (86.4%) and 18 
(90.0%) patients in the sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively, received at least one 
haemophilus influenzae vaccination in the previous 5 years or during the study; this is consistent with 
global variations in vaccination guidelines for patients with complement deficiency. 
Measurement of treatment compliance 
Twenty-two (100%) and 19 (95.0%) of patients in the sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively, 
were ≥80% compliant and 21 (95.5%) and 17 (85.0%), respectively were 100% compliant. Ten 
(45.5%) patients in the sutimlimab group and 8 (40.0%) patients in the placebo group received at 
least 1 dose out of window. In the sutimlimab group, 1 (4.5%) patient missed 1 dose at Week 7 due to 
COVID-19. In the placebo group, 1 (5.0%) patient missed 2 doses at Weeks 3 and 5) and 1 (5.0%) 
patient missed doses at Weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 due to COVID-19. No patient received 
a partial dose.

Among the 19 patients receiving sutimlimab that completed Part A, 3 did not meet the primary 
endpoint criteria. These 3 did not achieve the required ≥1.5 g/dL increase in haemoglobin from 
baseline to TAT and 1 of them received a transfusion. However, 2 of these 3 patients had an increase 
in haemoglobin of at ≥1.5 g/dL over baseline on at least one occasion that was not associated with a 
transfusion and also showed either a consistently or sporadically normalized bilirubin with the level 
above ULN at TAT. The third patient also demonstrated improvement in haemolysis but only achieved a 
maximum increase in haemoglobin of 1.1 g/dL on one occasion during Part A. 
An additional 3 patients were excluded from the primary endpoint analysis because they discontinued 
early due to TEAEs, including one patient who also received a prohibited CAD medication. Two of the 
patients who discontinued at Week 5 and Week 7, respectively, had achieved a ≥1.5 g/dL increase in 
haemoglobin and normalized bilirubin from Day 0 to the last dose of sutimlimab received. The third 
patient had a 1.2 g/dL increase in haemoglobin and a >50% reduction bilirubin from Day 0 to the last 
dose of sutimlimab at Week 5 and received a prohibited CAD medication after discontinuation from 
study treatment. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential closed procedure with alpha of 0.05 for 
each test with the hypothetical estimand. The first analysis compared the mean change in haemoglobin 
from baseline to TAT for sutimlimab versus placebo. Because this was significant, the comparison was 
further performed with mean change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue score at the treatment 
assessment timepoint. 
Mean change from baseline in haemoglobin at TAT 
The LS mean changes from baseline in haemoglobin to TAT were 2.66 g/dL (95% CI: 2.09 to 3.22) and 
0.09 g/dL (95% CI: -0.50 to 0.68) for sutimlimab and placebo, respectively, estimated from a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) model using the FAS. The LS mean difference in haemoglobin 
between sutimlimab and placebo from baseline to the TAT was 2.56 g/dL (p<0.001; 95% CI: 1.75 to 
3.38). Based on the results, there was a statistically significant difference in treatment effect on 
haemoglobin increase in favour of sutimlimab as compared to placebo.

The LS mean change in FACIT-Fatigue score at the TAT showed an increase of 10.83 points (95% CI: 
7.45 to 14.22) in the sutimlimab group and 1.91 points (95% CI: -1.65 to 5.46) in the placebo group, 
estimated from an MMRM model using the Full Analysis Set. The LS mean difference in FACIT-Fatigue 
score between sutimlimab and placebo from baseline to TAT was 8.93 points (p<0.001; 95% CI: 4.0 to 
13.85).

Additional secondary endpoints 
Mean change in bilirubin 
Normal range: 5.1 to 20.5 μmol/L. Among 17 patients in the sutimlimab group with baseline and TAT 
bilirubin values, the mean was 34.253 μmol/L (1.67-fold ULN) at baseline and 12.124 μmol/L (0.59-
fold ULN) at the TAT, a decrease of 22.129 (SD 10.468) μmol/L. Among 18 patients in the placebo 
group with baseline and TAT bilirubin values, the mean was 35.778 μmol/L (1.75-fold ULN) at baseline 
and 33.949 μmol/L (1.65-fold ULN) at the TAT, a decrease of 1.829 (SD 13.894) μmol/L. 
The mean bilirubin value in the sutimlimab group fell within the normal range, (ie, below ULN of 20.5 
μmol/L) at the first post-baseline assessment (Week 1) and continued to decrease until Week 7 after 
which it remained relatively stable through the TAT. 
Mean change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
Normal range: 120 to 246 U/L. Among 19 patients in the sutimlimab group with LDH data at both 
baseline and TAT, the baseline mean was 420.368 U/L (1.7 x ULN) and the mean at TAT was 269.535 
U/L (1.1 x ULN), a decrease of 150.833 U/L (SD 160.824). Among 20 patients in the placebo group 
with LDH data at both baseline and TAT, the baseline mean was 380.800 U/L (1.5 x ULN) and the 
mean at TAT was 388.400 (1.6 x ULN), an increase of 7.600 U/L (SD 212.690). At baseline 12 
(54.5%) and 13 (65.0%) patients in the sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively, had LDH values 
≤1.5 x ULN, and at the TAT, 18 (94.7%) and 14 (70.0%) patients, respectively, had LDH values ≤1.5 
x ULN. 
The mean decreases in LDH were observed in the sutimlimab group beginning at Week 9 that 
continued through Week 15 and were maintained until Week 26. In the placebo group, small 
fluctuations in LDH values were observed, with no overall reduction observed. Reductions in LDH 
observed in the sutimlimab group suggest a reduction in complement-mediated intravascular 
haemolysis. 
Incidence of solicited symptomatic anaemia at end of treatment 
In the sutimlimab group, the incidence of anaemia symptoms decreased from baseline to Week 26 for 
all individual components: fatigue (from 77.3% to 31.6%); weakness (from 63.6% to 5.3%), 
shortness of breath (from 50% to 5.3%); palpitations (from 27.3% to 0%); lightheadedness (from

13.6% to 5.3%); and chest pain (13.6% to 0%). In the placebo group, the incidence of anaemia 
symptoms decreased from baseline to Week 26 for weakness (from 50.0% to 31.6%) and shortness of 
breath (from 60.0% to 36.8%) and remained relatively stable for the remaining components including 
fatigue (from 75.0% to 68.4%); lightheadedness (from 10.0% to 15.8%); palpitations (from 20.0% to 
15.8%); and chest pain (from 5.0% to 5.3%). 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Classical pathway activity 
Mean ± SD CP (group) activity at baseline was 18.847% ±16.651 (6.5 g sutimlimab), 34.300% 
±26.073% (7.5 g sutimlimab), and 32.761% ±27.361% (placebo), which was low due to the nature of 
the disease. After the first dose of sutimlimab, the mean ± SD CP activity decreased to 0.794% 
±0.837% (6.5 g) and 0.820% ±0.847% (7.5 g) in the sutimlimab group, whereas the level remained 
comparable to baseline in the placebo group (33.126% ±26.787%). 
Figure 8. BIVV009-04 Part A: Mean CP (+SD) activity (predose) by visit - Observed - PD 
Analysis Set 
CH50  
The CH50 normal range in serum is between 31.6 and 57.6 U/mL. Mean ± SD CH50 levels were 
12.529 ±13.721 U/mL (6.5 g), 22.200 ±20.303 U/mL (7.5 g), and 20.750 ±19.936 U/mL (placebo) at 
baseline. The low CH50 values at baseline indicate low level of total complement activity, which is 
consistent with consumption of CP components due to ongoing overactivation of the CP by the auto-
antibodies causing the disease. After the first dose of sutimlimab and throughout the treatment period, 
the mean value of CH50 for the 6.5 g and 7.5 g sutimlimab dose groups was below limit of 
quantification, whereas the mean ± SD values and in placebo group ranged from 15.889 ±17.435 to 
23.889 ±20.355 U/mL. 
Total C4  
The SI reference range for serum C4 is 0.18 to 0.45 g/L. Blockade of C1s by sutimlimab increased 
circulating levels of C4 several-fold in patients, providing an in vivo readout of sutimlimab activity. The 
mean ± SD pre-treatment value, 0.051 ±0.044 g/L (6.5 g sutimlimab) and 0.082 ±0.065 g/L (7.5 g 
sutimlimab), was quickly restored to normal range. Mean ± SD predose C4 levels 1 week after the first 
dose were 0.227 ±0.061 g/L (6.5 g) and 0.262 ±0.069 g/L (7.5 g). These values remained within 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

normal range throughout 26 weeks of treatment. The mean ± SD C4 levels were unchanged, 
remaining low in the placebo group from baseline (0.071 ±0.070 g/L) throughout the treatment period 
(0.058 ±0.055 to 0.081 ±0.080 g/L). 
C1q  
C1q levels generally remained unchanged through the treatment period. The mean ± SD values at 
baseline were 78499.779 ±20816.769 ng/mL (6.5 g sutimlimab), 81971.412 ±11046.165 ng/mL (7.5 
g sutimlimab), and 76653.634 ±26819.620 ng/mL (placebo), and at Week 26 predose values were 
72226.034 ±19300.232 ng/mL (6.5 g sutimlimab), 71780.029 ±13571.965 ng/mL (7.5 g sutimlimab), 
and 68961.527 ±27837.948 ng/mL (placebo). Sutimlimab did not alter levels of C1q, indicating that 
the C1q-mediated pro-phagocytic “housekeeping” functions of the complement system, including 
removal of apoptotic cells, were not impacted. 
C1s  
Total C1s levels were measured in this study by a LC-MS/MS assay, in contrast to the free C1s 
quantitation from previous Phase 1 studies. The pre-treatment mean ± SD values were 39.144 
±10.845 μg/mL (6.5 g), 40.180 ±2.278 μg/mL (7.5 g), and 37.957 ±11.800 μg/mL (placebo). At 
Week 26, mean ± SD values in the sutimlimab groups increased to 53.467 ±14.395 μg/mL (6.5 g) and 
55.300 ±4.844 μg/mL (7.5 g) μg/mL, whereas the mean level in the placebo group was decreased 
relative to baseline (31.788 ±10.577 μg/mL). The C1s data support that sutimlimab slowed the 
clearance of the drug target. The accumulation of drug target due to mAb presence has been observed 
with a number of therapeutic antibodies including C5 inhibitors. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
To evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results, 3 sensitivity analyses were performed with 
different analysis populations. Consistent with the primary analysis, all 3 of the sensitivity analyses 
were statistically significant with odds ratios of 13.69 (p=0.001), 24.82 (p<0.001), and 14.93 
(p<0.001), respectively. 
Table 12. BIVV009-04 Summary of primary endpoint sensitivity analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The robustness of sutimlimab’s treatment effect has been evaluated in subgroup analysis. All the odds 
ratios in the subgroups with the exception of baseline weight ≥75kg are greater than 1, suggesting a 
consistent treatment effect in favour of sutimlimab over placebo. In particular, among patients who 
were previously treated with rituximab, 10 out of 12 patients in the sutimlimab arm met the primary 
composite response criteria and 1 out of 13 patients in the placebo arm met this criterion. The odds 
ratio for sutimlimab compared with placebo is 60.00 (95% CI: 4.72 to 763.01). There were no

responders among patients in the placebo group within the baseline weight ≥75 kg subgroup; thus, it 
was not possible to estimate the odds ratio for this subgroup. However, among patients with a body 
weight of 75 kg or more, there were 3/5 (60%; 95% CI 14.7%, 94.7%) responders; among those with 
a body weight < 75 kg, there were 13/17 (76.5%; 95% CI 50.1%, 93.2%) responders.

subgroups Composite estimand 
Post hoc sensitivity analyses 
Three post hoc sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint and the following 
secondary endpoints, mean changes in haemoglobin and FACIT-Fatigue from baseline to TAT without 
the 2 patients in the placebo group who inadvertently received a single dose of sutimlimab. The results 
of the analyses were consistent with the primary and main secondary endpoint analyses including 
these 2 patients. 
BIVV009-04 Part B 
Open-label, multicenter extension study enrolling patients who completed Part A of study BIVV009-04. 
The primary objective of Part B is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of sutimlimab in 
patients with primary CAD. The secondary objective is to investigate the durability of response during 
long-term treatment. Treatment/follow-up duration: 1 year following last patient out under Part A with 
9 weeks follow-up visit after last study drug administration. 
Beyond the permitted concomitant medications, study drug, and transfusions (same criteria as for Part 
A), patients were not supposed to receive other therapies for the treatment of CAD while enrolled. 
Samples for safety and efficacy measures were collected every 2 weeks; PK and PD samples as well as 
antidrug antibodies were collected approximately every 3 months. 
Efficacy endpoints included the following parameters of disease activity:  • Haemoglobin • Bilirubin 
(total) • QOL assessments (FACIT-fatigue, EQ-5D-5L, SF-12, PGIS, and PGIC) • LDH • Transfusion 
requirements • Haptoglobin • Total healthcare resource utilization at EOT • Satisfaction with home 
infusion after first home infusion and after fourth home infusion will be assessed in patients with home 
infusion. 
Results

Interim results based on a cut-off date of 29 September 2020 have been provided. A total of 37 
patients enrolled from Part A (17 from the sutimlimab group and 20 from the placebo group). As of the 
cut-off date, 33 (89.2%) patients were ongoing in Part B, including 15 and 18 from the ex-sutimlimab 
and ex-placebo groups, respectively. Two (11.8%) from the ex sutimlimab and 2 (10.0%) from the ex-
placebo group discontinued Part B early, three due to lack of efficacy and one due to withdrawal of 
consent. In median, patients received 45.1 weeks of sutimlimab treatment during part B and 14 
(37.8%) patients received at least 52 weeks of sutimlimab treatment during Part B. For combined 
Parts A and B, median duration of sutimlimab treatment was 67.98 weeks (range 28.3 to 123.1) for 
the ex-sutimlimab group and 41.67 weeks (range 3.0 to 86.0) for the ex-placebo group as of the cut-
off date. 
Change in haemoglobin levels 
Mean increases in haemoglobin observed for patients who switched from placebo in Part A to open-
label sutimlimab in Part B were similar to those observed for sutimlimab-treated patients upon 
initiation of Part A. Beginning at Week 29 (third week in Part B) the mean level of haemoglobin in the 
ex-placebo group reached the level observed in ex sutimlimab group, and was maintained at 
comparable level for both groups in Part B through the cut-off date.

04 Parts A and B) 
Change in bilirubin levels 
Mean decreases in bilirubin observed for patients who switched from placebo in Part A to open-label 
sutimlimab were similar to those observed for sutimlimab-treated patients upon initiation of Part A. At 
Week 27, after first dose of open-label sutimlimab, mean decrease in bilirubin in the ex-placebo group 
was almost as high as in the ex sutimlimab group. The mean decreases in bilirubin were overall 
maintained in Part B through the cut-off date.

Change in LDH 
At Week 26 (end of Part A), the mean change in LDH was -141 U/L in the sutimlimab arm and 26 U/L 
in the placebo arm. In the ex-sutimlimab arm, who continued with sutimlimab during part B, 
considerable fluctuations in LDH are noted. The mean and median LDH at week 26 was 285 U/L and

221 U/L respectively based on those 17 subjects who continued into part B. During part B (including 
data based on N>/=2), mean LDH varied from 218 U/L (week 89) to 488 U/L (week 37). In the ex-
placebo group who switched to sutimlimab during part B, there was no or little effect on LDH, again 
however with some fluctuations. Mean and median LDH at week 26 was 418 and 317 U/L respectively 
(N = 18). During part B (including data based on N>/=2), mean LDH varied from 296 U/L (week 45) 
to 584 U/L (week 93). 
Change in haptoglobin 
The mean baseline value of haptoglobin for the combined group was 0.20 g/L. Of note, haptoglobin 
levels <0.2 g/L were imputed as 0.2 g/L. At Week 26 (end of Part A) the mean increase was 0.32 g/L 
in the sutimlimab arm and 0.05 g/L in the placebo arm. For the remainder of Part B, prior to data cut-
off, the summary of changes from baseline in haptoglobin by visit showed an increase of variable 
extent at different time points. 
Transfusions 
In Part B prior 7 patients received a minimum of 1 transfusion (range of 1.0 to 27.0 transfusions per 
patient), including 2 patients, who were free of transfusions during Part A and received a transfusion 
during Part B. 
BIVV009-03 (CARDINAL) Part A 
“Cardinal”: A Phase 3 open-label, single-arm multicentre study to assess the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of sutimlimab in patients with primary cold agglutinin disease who have a recent history of 
blood transfusion (Part A). Part B was ongoing at the time of submission and will evaluate the long-
term safety, tolerability and durability of response of sutimlimab in patients with CAD. For Part A, 
diagnosis and eligibility was confirmed during a 6-week screening/observation period, followed by a 
26-week treatment period.

Females who were pregnant, lactating, or, if having reproductive potential, considered potentially 
unreliable with respect to contraceptive practice. 
Treatments 
Patients received fixed doses of sutimlimab via approximately 60 minutes IV infusion of either 6.5 g (if 
<75 kg) or 7.5 g (if ≥75 kg) on Day 0, Day 7, and every 14 days thereafter through Week 25. Patients 
with underlying cardiopulmonary disease could receive a 2-hour infusion. Patients who missed a dose 
(ie, outside the dosing window or >17 days since the last dose) were to receive an additional loading 
dose. 
Other treatments 
Treatment with rituximab monotherapy within 3 months of enrolment or rituximab combination 
therapies (e.g., with bendamustine, fludarabine, ibrutinib, or cytotoxic drugs) were prohibited within 6 
months of enrolment as well as during the study. 
During Part A, patients were not to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications/products 
until completion of the follow-up assessments, unless prescribed by the Investigator or another 
physician for the treatment of an AE. Concurrent administration of erythropoietin and/or a daily dose of 
corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤10 mg/day of prednisone) was acceptable, provided the patient had 
been on a stable dose during the previous 3 months. Concurrent use of vitamin B12, folate, and iron 
supplementation was acceptable, provided the patient had been on a stable dose during the previous 4 
weeks. 
Patients who met the transfusion criteria during the 6-month treatment period were to receive a RBC 
transfusion. 
Transfusion criteria 
• The haemoglobin level was <9 g/dL, and the patient was symptomatic. 
• The haemoglobin level was <7 g/dL, and the patient was asymptomatic. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Part A was to determine whether sutimlimab administration resulted in a ≥2 
g/dL increase in haemoglobin levels or increases haemoglobin to ≥12 g/dL and obviated the need for 
blood transfusion during treatment in patients with CAD who had a recent history of blood transfusion. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate. A patient was considered a responder if he or 
she did not receive a blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT) and did not receive 
treatment for CAD beyond what was permitted per protocol. Additionally, the patient’s haemoglobin 
level must have met either of the following criteria: 
•  Haemoglobin level was ≥12 g/dL at the treatment assessment endpoint (defined as the mean 
value from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) or 
•  Haemoglobin level increased by ≥2 g/dL from baseline (defined as the last haemoglobin value 
before administration of the first dose of study drug) at the treatment assessment endpoint. 
For analysis of primary efficacy endpoint, see Statistical methods below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 72/135 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for Part A were: 
•  Mean change from baseline in bilirubin (excluding patients with Gilbert’s syndrome) at the 
treatment assessment endpoint (defined as the mean value of Weeks 23, 25, and 26). 
•  Mean change from baseline in QOL, as assessed by the change in Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale scores at the treatment assessment endpoint. 
•  Mean change from baseline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the treatment assessment 
endpoint. 
•  Number of transfusions and number of units after the first 5 weeks of study drug 
administration. 
•  Mean change from baseline in haemoglobin at the treatment assessment endpoint. 
Sample size 
Approximately 20 patients with CAD who had a recent history of transfusion were to be enrolled. If the 
true responder rate was estimated to be 66% and a minimum of 30% was required for success, then 
with 20 patients, there was 90% probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI was at least 30%. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
N/A (open-label study) 
Statistical methods 
For the purposes of regulatory submission, an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data will be 
performed for Part A after all patients have completed Part A. Parts A and B will have separate 
database locks to enable submission of the BLA/MAA following completion of Part A.  
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose 
(including partial dose) of study drug. Analyses of efficacy were performed on the FAS. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population was defined as a subset of FAS who did not have any important 
protocol deviations impacting their efficacy assessments. Selected efficacy endpoints were analyzed for 
the PP population. 
Patients who received at least 1 dose (including partial dose) of study drug were included in the 
Safety Analysis Set. Note that the Safety Analysis Set was the same as the FAS in this study. 
Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable sample for baseline 
and PK concentrations were included in PK Analysis Set. 
All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable sample for baseline 
and PD analyses during Part A were included in the PD analysis set. 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Each patient in the FAS population was classified as meeting the criteria of the primary endpoint 
(responder) or not meeting the criteria of the primary endpoint (non-responder) and the 95% CI for 
the proportion of responders was calculated using Clopper-Pearson exact method. 
Primary endpoint criteria: A patient was considered a responder in Part A if he or she did not receive a 
blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT) and did not receive treatment for CAD beyond

what is permitted per protocol. Additionally, the patient’s haemoglobin level must have met either of 
the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The haemoglobin level increased by ≥2 g/dL from baseline (defined as the last haemoglobin 
value before administration of the first dose of study drug) at the treatment assessment 
endpoint. 
The haemoglobin level was ≥12 g/dL at the treatment assessment endpoint (defined as the 
mean value from Weeks 23, 25, and 26). 
Any patient withdrawing from the study prior to the Week 23 visit was considered a nonresponder. To 
assess the hematology component of response, the mean of the nonmissing haemoglobin assessments 
at the Week 23, Week 25, and Week 26 analysis visits (treatment assessment endpoint) was used. 
Patients missing all 3 analysis visits were counted as nonresponder. With the determination that a 
response rate ≤30% was not clinically relevant, the success criteria for the primary endpoint was that 
the 95% lower bound CI for response rate excludes 30% using the exact Clopper-Pearson method. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on the Composite Estimand, for which any 
missing response was considered a non-responder. Sensitivity analyses were carried out based on the 
Completer Estimand and the Per-protocol Estimand, respectively. Subgroup analyses for the primary 
endpoint were performed by age (<65 and ≥65 years), gender, baseline weight (<75 and ≥75 kg), 
number of transfusions within 12 months prior to study entry (≤2, 3-4, >4), baseline haemoglobin 
level (<8.5 and ≥8.5 g/dL), and previous rituximab therapy and/or cytotoxic therapy (yes/no). For 
these analyses, if there were <5 patients in a category, the cutoff may have been modified to adjust 
distribution. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline in haemoglobin, bilirubin, LDH, and FACIT-
Fatigue) were analyzed using the Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) at the treatment 
assessment endpoint. Analyses were performed based on the Hypothetical Estimand where any post-
baseline value after transfusion and prohibited medication (from Week 5 to Week 26) is considered 
missing and the De-facto Estimand where all available data is used, respectively. Additional sensitivity 
analyses were carried out using multiple imputations.

Baseline disease characteristics 
Of the 24 subjects in the FAS, 16 (66.7%) had any hospitalization related to CAD within the last 2 
years. None had a prior haematological malignancy and 8/24 subjects had a prior thromboembolic 
event, primarily venous (5 events of pulmonary embolism, 2 of deep vein thrombosis). 
At baseline, median haemoglobin was 8.65 g/dL (range 4.9 to 11.1; normal range determined by local 
laboratory at site), bilirubin was 45.85 μmol/L (range 16.1 to 112.4; normal range 5.1 to 20.5), LDH 
was 325 U/L (range 160 to 1040; normal range 120 to 246), haptoglobin was 0.2 g/L (range 0.2 to 
1.6; normal range 0.4 to 2.4 [note that values <0.2 g/L were imputed as 0.2 g/L]); and absolute 
reticulocytes were 115.7 × 109/L (range 27.7 to 301.0; normal range determined by local laboratory). 
A total of 15 (62.5%) patients had received prior CAD therapy within the last 5 years, including 
corticosteroids (10/24), single agent therapy with rituximab (12/24) or ibrutinib (1/24), combinations 
regimens (6/24, most frequently bendamustine/rituximab), or other chemotherapy (5/24). One patient 
had been treated with plasmapheresis. 
Fatigue was reported by 22/22 who had data available at day -42 and 18/24 at baseline. Weakness 
was reported by 18/22 at day -42 and 15/24 at baseline. Shortness of breath was reported by 17/22 
at day -42 and 13/24 at baseline. Palpitations/fast heartbeat was reported by 11/22 at day -42 
and 7/24 at baseline. Light-headedness/presyncope was reported by 3/22 at day -42 and 0/24 at 
baseline.  Chest pain was reported by 3/22 at day -42 and 0/24 at baseline. Acrocyanosis was 
reported by 5/22 at day -42 and 3/24 at baseline. Raynaud’s syndrome was reported by 3/22 at day 
-42 and 1/24 at baseline. Haemoglobinuria was reported by 8/22 at day -42 and 5/24 at baseline. 
Disabling circulatory symptoms was reported by 0/22 at day -42 and 2/24 at baseline. Major 
adverse vascular event including thrombosis was reported by 3/22 at day -42 and 0/24 at baseline.

Concomitant medication 
The most frequently used concomitant medications were antianemic preparations (15 patients, 
62.5%), drugs for acid related disorders (15, 62.5%), antithrombotic agents (14, 58.3%), analgesics 
(12, 50.0%), antibacterials for systemic use (9, 37.5%), vaccines (7, 29.2%), vitamins (7, 29.2%),

agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (6, 25.0%), beta blocking agents (6, 25.0%), 
corticosteroids for systemic use (6, 25.0%), and diuretics (6, 25.0%). All patients had received at least 
one meningococcal (conjugate) vaccine, and at least one streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine in the 
previous 5 years or during the study. Twenty of 24 patients received at least one haemophilus 
influenzae vaccination in the previous 5 years or during the study; this is consistent with global 
variations in vaccination guidelines for patients with complement deficiency. 
Numbers analysed 
The FAS corresponds to the ITT and the SAS with all 24 subjects. The FAS was used for the analyses 
below unless otherwise stated. The Per Protocol set includes 22/24 subjects. Two subjects discontinued 
early: one due to adverse event and one due to death. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: The study met the primary endpoint. Of the 24 patients in the FAS, 13 
patients met the composite primary endpoint criteria and the lower bound of the response rate was 
>30% (54.2%, 95% CI: 32.8% to 74.4%).

Eleven patients did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint: 
•  Six patients had some evidence of a response. Of these, 4 patients had an increase in Hb level 
≥1 g/dL; 1 patient had an increase in Hb level ≥2 g/dL with Hb level ≥12 g/dL at the 
treatment assessment endpoint (TAE) with no transfusion beyond Week 15. The sixth patient 
had a change in Hb level from 11.0 g/dL to 11.83 g/dL at the TAE in the absence of 
transfusions. 4 of the 6 patients experienced normalization of their bilirubin levels that 
correlated with improvements in Hb levels. The reasons for not meeting the criteria for the 
primary endpoint in these 6 patients included transient decreases in haemolytic anaemia 
during Weeks 5 to 26 due to missed doses, intercurrent infection/inflammation, and variability 
in Hb levels with lower levels at the end of Part A. 
• 
• 
Two patients discontinued early: 1 patient discontinued after 2 doses due to an unrelated fatal 
malignancy and gastrointestinal bleeding; the other patient discontinued after 6 doses due to a 
pre-treatment AE, had improvement in Hb and bilirubin at Week 3, but the next dose was 
delayed beyond 17 days, Hb decreased, and the patient received 2 transfusions. 
Three patients did not have a response. This was determined based on decreases in Hb, 
bilirubin levels that did not normalize, and/or little or minimal improvement on the FACIT-
Fatigue. 
Of the 11 patients who did not meet the pre-defined criteria of the primary endpoint, all except the 2 
patients who discontinued treatment Part A elected to continue sutimlimab treatment in Part B. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
In the model for hypothetical estimand which was used to assess change from baseline at the TAE, if a 
subject had a transfusion or received protocol prohibited medication after Week 5, their values (for the 
study endpoint) after the transfusion or receipt of protocol prohibited medication were considered 
missing, but all other available data were used in the MMRM model.

Mean change from baseline in FACIT-F score 
Among 17 patients with evaluable baseline and treatment assessment endpoint (TAE) FACIT-fatigue 
values, the mean score was 31.24 at baseline and 44.26 at the TAE, a mean increase of 13.03 points. 
Mean change from baseline in lactate dehydrogenase 
The normal range for LDH was 120-246 U/L. Among 17 patients with evaluable baseline and TAE LDH 
values, the mean LDH was 424.06 U/L (1.7-fold ULN) at baseline and 301.91 U/L (1.2-fold ULN) at the 
TAE. 
Transfusions received before and after initiating sutimlimab treatment 
The 24 subjects had at least one, in mean 3.2, RBC transfusions (median 2.0, range 1 to 19) during 
the prior 6 months. During the 6-week screening period, patients had a mean of 1.7 transfusions 
(median 1.0, range 0 to 8). Fifteen of the 24 patients had at least 1 transfusion. 
During the first 5 weeks of sutimlimab treatment, patients had a mean of 0.3 transfusions (median 0, 
range 0 to 2). Five of 24 patients had at least 1 transfusion and 4 of the 5 patients had a transfusion 
after the first 5 weeks. Between Weeks 5 and 26, patients had a mean of 0.9 transfusions (median 0, 
range 0 to 13). Six of 23 patients had at least 1 transfusion. 
Mean change from baseline in haemoglobin levels 
Among 17 patients with evaluable baseline and treatment assessment endpoint (TAE) haemoglobin 
values, mean haemoglobin was 8.45 g/dL at baseline and 11.63 g/dL at the TAE. The LS mean change 
at the TAE was an increase of 2.60 g/dL (95% CI: 0.74 to 4.46). Mean increases in haemoglobin were 
observed beginning at Week 1, with a maximum increase observed at Week 7. 
Haemoglobin levels after missed doses 
Ten patients had dosing intervals exceeding 17 days and 6 of the patients had evidence of rebound 
anaemia. Four of the 6 patients had 1 occurrence of a >17-day interval between doses, including three 
patients who required a transfusion and one patient who had a decrease in haemoglobin level, but no 
transfusion. The other 2 patients each had 2 occurrences of >17-day intervals; one patient had

points), physical functioning (6.39 points), role physical (7.14 points), and vitality (12.91 points) were 
observed at Week 26; other subscale scores were similar to baseline during the treatment period. 
Changes in haptoglobin and reticulocyte levels

Haptoglobin: The normal range for haptoglobin was 0.4-2.4 g/L. Values <0.2 g/L were imputed as 0.2 
g/L.  Twenty-two patients had non-detectable haptoglobin levels (<0.2 g/L) at baseline. At Week 26, 4 
of 22 patients had detectable levels at Week 26, while 15 patients still had non-detectable levels and 
data were missing for 3 patients. Sixteen patients had at least one detectable value through Week 26. 
Reticulocytes: Among 17 patients with evaluable baseline and Week 26 absolute reticulocyte values, 
mean reticulocyte counts decreased by 54.92 × 109/L between baseline and Week 26. After an initial 
decrease in reticulocyte count was observed from Weeks 1 to 5, renormalization of absolute 
reticulocyte counts were observed through Week 15 to levels lower than baseline that were generally 
maintained through the Week 26 and appropriate for the corresponding mean haemoglobin.

Pharmacodynamic results 
Classical pathway activity 
The CP activities in CAD patients were low during screening and baseline, which is consistent with the 
nature of the disease, and supported by the suppressed levels of C4 observed in these patients prior to 
treatment. At baseline, the mean ± SD CP activity overall was 19.97 ± 16.69%. After the first dose of 
sutimlimab, the mean CP activity decreased to 0.50% ± 0.876%, which was consistent with what was 
observed in Phase 1 studies. The near complete inhibition of CP was sustained throughout the 
treatment period.

CH50 
Only 11 patients had quantifiable CH50 levels at baseline (pre-treatment), of which 1 patient had 
quantifiable levels after the first dose of sutimlimab. The low unquantifiable CH50 levels of the 
remaining patients at baseline was consistent with consumption of CP components due to ongoing 
increased activation of the CP by the disease. In the context of the increased C4 seen after sutimlimab 
treatment, the data indicate that sutimlimab effectively inhibited CP activity. 
Total C4 
Baseline levels of C4, the first substrate cleaved following activation of C1s, were low in patients with 
CAD, owing to cold agglutinin–mediated classical pathway consumption. Blockade of C1s by sutimlimab 
increased circulating levels of C4 several-fold in patients, providing an in vivo readout of sutimlimab 
activity. The data showed that the mean pre-treatment value, 0.04 g/L, was quickly restored to normal 
range, 0.22 g/L after the first dose of sutimlimab (SI reference range 0.18- 0.45 g/L). The C4 levels 
remained in the normal range throughout the treatment period.

C1q 
C1q levels generally remained unchanged through the treatment period with the mean ± SE at 
baseline 84956 ± 35723 ng/mL and 77886 ± 28302 ng/mL predose at Week 25. Sutimlimab did not 
alter levels of C1q, indicating that the role of C1q in the pro-phagocytic “housekeeping” functions of 
the complement system, including removal of apoptotic cells, were not impacted.  
C1s 
Total C1s levels were measured in this study, in contrast to the free C1s quantitation from previous 
Phase 1 studies. The pre-treatment mean ± SD, 44.23 ± 12.94 μg/mL, increased slightly to 55.15 ± 
20.96 μg/mL at Week 25. The accumulation of target due to mAb on-board has been observed with 
therapeutic antibodies including C5 inhibitors. The C1s data support that sutimlimab slowed the 
clearance of the target. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
The robustness of the results was tested in 3 sensitivity analyses, which all supported the results of the 
primary endpoint. Consistent with the primary analysis, the lower bound of the 95% CI for the 
response rate was >30% in these analyses. 
•  Sensitivity analysis 1: In this analysis, where normalization of haemoglobin was considered a 
value of ≥LLN instead of ≥12 g/dL, the response rate was 58.3%, (95% CI: 36.6% to 77.9%). 
•  Sensitivity analysis 2: In this analysis, patients in the FAS were included if they completed 
treatment at least through Week 23 and had at least 1 evaluable haemoglobin value from 
Week 23, 25, and 26. The response rate was 59.1%, (95% CI: 36.4% to 79.3%).

•  Sensitivity analysis 3: In this analysis, including patients in the PP, ie, those who did not have 
important protocol deviations impacting efficacy assessments, the response rate was 59.1% 
(95% CI: 36.4% to 79.3%).

BIVV009-03 Part B 
Long-term extension, open-label study to assess the safety and durability of response of sutimlimab in 
patients with CAD who had a recent history of blood transfusions and had completed Part A of the 
study. IV sutimlimab doses of 6.5 g (if <75 kg) or 7.5 g (if ≥75 kg) were administered every 14 days 
during Part B. Treatment/follow-up duration: 2 years following last patient out under Part A with 9 
weeks follow-up visit after last study drug administration. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of sutimlimab in CAD. The 
secondary objective of Part B was to investigate the durability of response during long-term treatment 
with sutimlimab in CAD. Exploratory objectives pertained to home infusions (not implemented) and 
evaluation of immunogenicity of sutimlimab. Beyond the permitted concomitant medications, study 
drug, and transfusions (same criteria as for Part A), patients were not supposed to receive other 
therapies for the treatment of CAD while enrolled. 
For patients who had completed Part A, haematology panel and clinical chemistry panel (including 
markers of haemolysis); recording of concomitant medications/procedures including transfusions was 
performed every 2 weeks. In addition, the following procedures of interest for efficacy were performed 
every 3 months: QoL assessments: FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D-5L, SF-12, PGIC/PGIS (every 6 months); PK 
and PD sampling. No PK or PD results have been provided with the interim report.

Results 
Interim results based on a cut-off date of 29 September 2020 have been provided. 
Of the 22 patients who completed Part A of the study, all enrolled into Part B. As of the interim cut-off, 
21 patients were ongoing, and 1 patient discontinued treatment due to AEs of dyspepsia, cyanosis 
(reported by the Investigator as acrocyanosis), dysphagia, and erosive gastritis. The study population 
had a median age of 71.5 years, and most patients (81.8%) were ≥65 years. Most patients (68.2%) 
were from Europe, and most (68.2%) were female. In Part B, patients received a median of 77.6 
weeks (range 27.9 to 107.9 weeks) of sutimlimab and a median of 38.0 administered doses of 
sutimlimab. 
Thirteen (59.1%) patients had at least 1 major protocol deviation, mostly prohibited medications (8 
[36.4%] patients); and investigational product, study conduct, visit procedures and subject safety (3 
[13.6%] patients each). Major deviations within the prohibited medications subcategory concerned use 
of protocol-forbidden medication or increase in dose of a medication that was allowed to be given at 
stable dose. 
Change in haemoglobin levels 
Mean haemoglobin levels were maintained at ≥11 g/dL throughout Part B. However, six patients 
received transfusion during Part B.

Change in FACIT-F 
Higher FACIT-Fatigue subscale scores denote better QoL. Score ranges from 0-52. At baseline, mean 
and median FACIT-F scores were 32.43 and 38.00 for the 21 patients participating in part B with these 
data available; min-max were 14.0-47.0. At week 39, mean and median FACIT-F scores were 40.79 
and 45.00 (based on 19 subjects); min-max were 5.0-52.0. At week 87, mean and median FACIT-F 
scores were 41.28 and 43.50 (based on 18 subjects); min-max were 6.0-52.0. Similar levels of FACIT-
F scores are reported at week 99 and week 111 but with a decreasing number of subjects (12 and 8 
respectively). 
Change in LDH 
The normal range for LDH was 120-246 U/L. The mean change from baseline was -111.6 UL (range -
863.0, 449.0) at Week 27 (n=22), -49.3 UL (range -495.0; 254.0) at Week 39 (n=15), and -4.50 UL 
(range -301.0; 118.0) at Week 99 (n=14).

Results and Analysis 
Analysis description  Primary Analysis 
Analysis population and 
time point description 
The analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted on the COVID-adjusted 
Composite estimand. The COVID-adjusted Composite estimand consists of a subset of 
FAS (all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose [including partial dose] of 
study drug) who did not miss any visits or discontinue early due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The odds ratio of the proportion of responders between groups along with a 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio was calculated using the Cochran-Mantel 
Haenszel test. 
As the primary analysis reached statistical significance, the key secondary 
endpoints, i.e. change from baseline in hemoglobin and FACIT-Fatigue Score at TAT, were 
tested in above order using the hypothetical estimand and a sequential closed procedure 
with alpha of 0.05 for each test.

Notes 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint involved the composite estimand, 
for which any missing response for a component of the primary efficacy endpoint 
rendered the patient a non-responder.   
If a patient had a COVID-related infusion gap (defined as 2 consecutive missed 
infusions due to COVID-19), transfusions received and protocol-prohibited CAD 
medications taken during the infusion gap and within the 5 weeks following the infusion 
gap were not to be included in the responder derivation. Since none of the patients with 
COVID-19-related infusion gaps received a transfusion or prohibited medication, the 
patients included in the COVID-19-adjusted composite estimand were the same as the 
patients in the composite estimand as defined in the SAP. 
The change from baseline in bilirubin at the TAT was analyzed for FAS excluding 
subjects with Gilbert’s syndrome either confirmed or not ruled out.

Study BIVV009-01 Part C addressed safety and tolerability of sutimlimab; secondary objectives 
included pharmacodynamics of sutimlimab with respect to CP function and disease-related biomarkers; 
see section 2 above. Study BIVV009-01 Part E is a long-term follow-up from the phase 1 study. 
Methods 
Study BIVV009-01 Part E 
Study BIVV009-01 Part E enrolled patients with a history of CAD who had previously been treated with 
sutimlimab in a sutimlimab clinical trial or NPP with evidence of treatment response. Sutimlimab 5.5 g 
to 7.5 g doses were administered IV at week 0, week 1, and every 2 weeks thereafter. Under Version 
13.0 of the protocol, patients received 5.5 g sutimlimab at each infusion; under Version 15.0 of the 
protocol (17 April 2018), patients in Part E who weighed <75 kg were to receive fixed sutimlimab 
doses of 6.5 g; patients who weighed ≥75 kg were to receive infusions of fixed sutimlimab doses of 
7.5 g. For patients with evidence of biochemical breakthrough haemolysis (rapid fall in haemoglobin ≥2 
g/dL and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/bilirubin and/or decrease in haptoglobin since last

scheduled visit), re-loading with an additional dose of sutimlimab is permitted. Duration of treatment: 
Indefinite (ongoing, long-term treatment continuation study). Duration of observation: Up to 30 days 
after the last dose of study medication. 
The primary objective of Part E was to evaluate the safety. No efficacy endpoint was designated. 
Exploratory PD endpoints included disease-related biomarkers: cold agglutinin titre; haptoglobin and 
routine clinical lab parameters of haemolysis (haemoglobin, haematocrit, reticulocyte count, LDH, 
bilirubin), and specific LDH isoforms. 
Results 
Change in haemoglobin levels 
At baseline, haemoglobin values were below LLN for all 4 patients, with a median baseline value of 
8.25 g/dL (range, 7.7 to 9.6 g/dL). At Day 7, median increase in haemoglobin over baseline was 1.30 
g/dL (range, 0.1 to 1.9 g/dL). By Week 3 of treatment, an increase from baseline in haemoglobin could 
be observed for all 4 patients, with a median increase of 2.20 g/dL (range, 1.3 to 3.8 g/dL). By Week 
7, the median increase in haemoglobin over baseline was 2.65 g/dL (range, 2.4 to 4.5 g/dL), and 
haemoglobin values for 3 patients were in the normal range (>12 g/dL). With the exception of declines 
in haemoglobin observed in the fourth patient prior to being discontinued from the study due to an AE, 
patients’ improvements in haemoglobin stabilized after 5 weeks of treatment. Accordingly, mean 
improvements over baseline haemoglobin by at least 2 g/dL were observed through the study. 
Change in bilirubin levels 
During the first 2 weeks of treatment, bilirubin concentrations dropped rapidly in all 4 patients, with 3 
of the patients attaining normal bilirubin values by Day 7. These 3 patients maintained normal bilirubin 
levels from Day 7 up to the cut-off date, whereas the levels of the fourth patient appeared to become 
more variable prior to discontinuing from the study. 
Change in LDH 
In BIVV009-01 Part E, over the first 3 weeks of treatment, LDH levels dropped rapidly in all 4 patients. 
By Week 3, mean decreases in LDH of -215.7 ±53.59 U/L (range, -251 to 154) were observed. In 3 
patients, LDH levels appeared to stabilize below baseline levels, with values for individual patients 
frequently falling below the upper limit of normal, 250 U/L. Levels of LDH in the fourth patient 
appeared to become more variable but remained below baseline until the patient discontinued from the 
study. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy assessment of sutimlimab in primary CAD relies on two phase 3 studies, addressing slightly 
different populations (transfusion-free in the controlled BIVV009-04 study vs recently transfused in the 
open-label single-arm BIVV009-03 study). Both studies utilised the posology intended for marketing. 
CAD is rare, which is reflected by the small study sizes (22 and 24 sutimlimab-treated patients, 
respectively). Both studies have completed the main periods (Part A) of six months; long-term 
extension studies (Part B) are now completed.  
The randomised placebo-controlled design of BIVV009-04 Part A is considered to provide more robust 
data. Although the number of patients studied in a controlled setting is limited, the study design is 
overall found adequate, with 22 sutimlimab treated subjects and 20 subjects receiving placebo, 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 94/135 
 
 
 
followed for a 6-month main study period. Study BIVV009-03 is considered to further support efficacy 
albeit less conclusively due to the open-label single-arm study design. 
In general, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable. The study population selected is 
reflective of the target population indicated for treatment of haemolytic anaemia with (primary) CAD. 
Key eligibility criteria for study BIVV009-04 were a baseline haemoglobin (Hb) level ≤10 g/dL, active 
haemolysis with a bilirubin level above the normal reference range, exclusion of patients with a history 
of blood transfusion within 6 months of screening, or history of more than one blood transfusion within 
12 months of screening. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for study BIVV009-03 are generally in line 
with those of the study BIVV009-04, though with the exception that a transfusion history of ≥1 blood 
transfusions within 6 months of enrolment was allowed and was acceptable. Both phase 3 studies 
included adults only, which is reasonable given that CAD occurs almost exclusively in higher age 
groups. A strength of both studies is that secondary CAS was to be excluded by a specific exclusion 
criterion as well as through bone marrow biopsies. The threshold for transfusion dependence set for 
study BIVV009-03 is considered rather low with at least 1 documented blood transfusion within 6 
months of enrolment, implying that the burden of disease could differ between subjects; some patients 
may warrant transfusion only in relation to transient deterioration due to e.g., infectious disease, but 
may otherwise not require treatment, whereas others warrant regular RBC transfusions. Nevertheless, 
both studies aimed at including patients with symptomatic disease and moderate to severe haemolytic 
anaemia (Hb <10 g/dL). 
There is currently no approved specific therapy in primary CAD although therapy to reduce antibody 
production in patients with symptomatic disease is widespread, primarily through rituximab-containing 
regimens. Other standard of care includes RBC transfusions and plasmapheresis. In both the phase 3 
sutimlimab studies, specific therapy to reduce antibody production was prohibited; thus, there are no 
efficacy data on sutimlimab in combination or in comparison with therapy to reduce antibody 
production in CAD like retuximab, including plasmapheresis which was not allowed. 
Both studies started with a 6-week observation/screening period, during which RBC transfusions were 
allowed; RBC transfusions were also indicated during the main periods of the studies if patients had a 
Hb <9 g/dl and were symptomatic, or Hb <7 g/dl regardless of symptoms. They decision on a need for 
transfusion was taken at the investigator’s discretion without applying any standardised criteria.  
Endpoints 
For both phase 3 studies, the primary endpoint was the responder rate, with slightly different 
definitions of a responder: 
In study BIVV009-04, a responder was to meet all of the following 3 components: Hb increase ≥1.5 
g/dL from baseline, no RBC transfusion week 5-26 and no prohibited CAD treatment week 5-26. The 
Hb increase was defined from baseline (last value before first dose of sutimlimab) to the mean value 
from Weeks 23, 25, and 26. The secondary endpoints pertained to laboratory parameters related to 
haemolysis and anaemia, effect on CAD-related complications and QoL assessments. 
For study BIVV009-03, a responder was to be free from blood transfusion and non-permitted CAD 
treatment from Week 5 through Week 26 and not having received treatment for CAD beyond what was 
permitted per protocol, with either Hb ≥12 g/dL at the treatment assessment endpoint (mean value 
from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) or increased by ≥2 g/dL from baseline. Secondary endpoints included 
markers of haemolysis, QoL assessments and number of transfusions. 
The primary endpoints in both studies are considered appropriate and are overall in line with the 
Protocol Assistance given. To assess the effect of sutimlimab, it is reasonable to have Hb levels in 
absence of RBC transfusions and/or specific CAD treatment which could otherwise have increased the 
Hb value. An increase in Hb of 1.5-2 g/dl or reaching Hb ≥12 g/dL could be clinically relevant per se, 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 95/135 
 
 
 
as RBC transfusions could be given based on Hb level only but is further strengthened by the 
secondary endpoints related to an effect on markers of haemolysis and more symptom-oriented 
secondary endpoints, especially from the controlled study BIVV009-04. It is unlikely that a patient with 
primary CAD would spontaneously improve at least 1.5 g/dl in Hb levels, if no blood transfusions or 
other specific CAD treatment were given, unless enrolled during a period of deterioration or haemolytic 
crisis. Some improvement is noted during the screening period in both studies. Since worsening of 
symptoms could be triggered by minor exogenous factors, recruiting patients with stable disease may 
be unfeasible; however, this highlights that some patients improve spontaneously and thus that the 
treatment needs may vary over time. The Applicant was asked to discuss to what extent the variable 
course of symptomatic disease may impact the efficacy assessments, and whether treatment with 
sutimlimab is intended to be continuous or could be intermittent, during periods of deterioration only.  
The Applicant commented on the choice for continuous rather than episodic treatment and argued that 
episodic treatment would not be in line with the posology as studied in the phase 3 CADENZA and 
CARDINAL trials and the primary mechanism of haemolysis. This is now reflected in Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. Notwithstanding, it remains uncertain if episodic treatment would be the most beneficial 
treatment strategy in patients with controlled haemolysis (i.e. without anaemia). Some patients will 
need continuous treatment whereas other might be anaemic only periodically, this is nevertheless 
captured by the indication wording (stating haemolytic anaemia) in combination with the 
recommendations to apply continuous treatment.    
The difference in study populations between the 2 phase 3 trials led to a difference in primary 
endpoints. A response in the CARDINAL trial was defined as a higher increase in Hb (≥(>2g/dL from 
baseline or ≥12 g/dL at TAT) as compared to the CADENZA trial, in which a response was defined as 
an increase of > 1.5 g/dL in Hb from baseline. However, a post-hoc analysis using the primary 
endpoint of an increase of >1.5 g/dL as response definition showed no differences in outcomes 
between studies.  
Statistics 
The sample size for study BIVV009-04 was estimated to be approximately 40 patients (20 in each 
treatment arm), which is limited but acceptable as this concerns an orphan disease. This was based on 
a treatment difference of 50% for placebo response rates between the range of 15% to 40% and a 
statistical power of greater than 85%. 
The primary efficacy analysis for study BIVV009-04 was to compare the proportion of patients meeting 
primary endpoint criteria ("responder rate") in the sutimlimab treatment arm with the placebo 
treatment arm using the COVID-adjusted Composite estimand as defined in Table 7. If no patients 
missed both the Week 23 and 25 study visits due to COVID-19, the primary efficacy analysis was to be 
performed using the Composite estimand. To reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference, the 
pooled 2-sided p-value based on a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test had to be <0.05. 
The test was to be stratified by baseline haemoglobin (< median baseline haemoglobin versus ≥ 
median baseline haemoglobin) and geographic region (Japan/Australia, United States, Europe). In the 
case of completely unbalanced strata (all records within any strata fall within a single treatment arm), 
the CMH test was to be stratified only by baseline haemoglobin. In addition, the proportion of subjects 
who met each of the 3 response criteria as well as the number of transfusions by study period (before 
Week 5 and between Week 5 and Week 26) and by treatment arm were summarized. The FAS set 
consisting of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose (including partial dose) of IMP was 
used for the primary analysis. The definition of FAS analysis sets does not include all randomised 
subjects that is the basis for the intention to treat since it requires at least one dose of randomised 
treatment. There are no patients that were randomised but did not receive treatment, hence no 
additional analyses will be needed due to the definition excluding subjects not treated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 96/135 
 
 
 
The primary estimand is defined to account for missing visits and treatments due to the COVID 
pandemic. Patients having a COVID-related infusion gap (defined as >=2 consecutive missed infusions 
due to COVID), transfusions received, and protocol-prohibited CAD medications taken during the 
infusion gap and within the 5 weeks following the infusion gap were not to be included in the primary 
endpoint (“responder”) derivation. In addition, data for missing haemoglobin assessments were 
imputed prior to determining whether the haemoglobin level would be determined as failure or not. It 
is stated that none of these decision rules were fulfilled, leading to the primary COVID-adjusted 
estimand and the original estimand resulting in the same analysis.  
For the primary endpoint, responder, handling of missing data is incorporated by the defined 
intercurrent events and the handling of those. Patients who discontinued the study early were 
considered non-responders. Patients with no Hb data at weeks 23, 25 and 26 for reasons other than 
Covid were also considered non-responders. The supplementary analyses planned includes the 
originally planned analysis and analyses using mFAS and PP. 
For the secondary endpoints, change from baseline, the primary estimand is a hypothetical estimand 
where data after intercurrent events (ICE) are treated as missing and implicitly imputed using the 
MMRM model under the assumption of missing at random. Sensitivity analyses are planned using a 
pattern-mixture model with a control-based imputation strategy. Supplementary analyses for the 
secondary endpoints were planned, applying a treatment policy approach where all available data is 
used, and missing data is imputed by the MMRM model.  
It is considered that the planned primary, sensitivity and supplementary analyses cover the exploration 
of impact of COVID, other ICE and missing data and allow for interpretation of the robustness of the 
results. 
The study report mentioned one blinded interim analysis performed before Part A had completed. 
According to the SAP, an interim safety and efficacy analysis was to be performed for Part A after all 
patients had completed Part A and the data had been cleaned (Part A analysis). The applicant clarified 
that a blinded interim analysis was carried out to support a biologics license application (BLA) for the 
FDA based on a data cut off of 29 September 2020. This corresponds to the date for last patient out in 
part A and, hence, the results of the analysis have not influenced the conduct of Part A. Parts A and B 
were to have separate database locks to enable MAA submission following completion of Part A. 
Additional analyses of Part B data will be defined in a separate Part B SAP. Changes to the analysis 
plan with regard to COVID-related events was only documented in the SAP v.2. From the now provided 
SAP v1.0 it was clarified that the amendments pertained to any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
the efficacy evaluation and the introduction of a modified FAS. The SAP v1.0 was issued on the same 
date as amendment 7; 07-Jul-2020. This is late during the conduct of Part A which completed in 
September 2020. However, as there were no patients affected by COVID-related infusion gaps this is 
not considered an issue for interpretation of the study results. Database lock and unblinding of part A 
was clarified to had both occurred on 11 Nov 2020. Sponsor personnel (except for those who provide 
drug supply) were blinded to the treatment assignment until the interim analysis (Part A DBL). Of note, 
last participant completed Part A on 29 September 2020, hence, prior to the unblinding.  The Applicant 
adequately provided the estimand definition and attributes for the primary analysis as requested and 
further explained the differences between the COVID-adjusted composite estimand and the composite 
estimand.  
The sample size for study BIVV009-03 of approximately 20 patients was based on a successful 
estimated responder rate of 66% with a minimum of 30%. For the trial to be successful the 95% lower 
bound CI for the response rate should exclude 30%. 
Regarding the statistical methods of the study, for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, a 
composite estimand was used while patients with missing values were considered as non-responders.

This leads to a conservative effect estimate and is considered acceptable as it is supplemented with 
sensitivity analyses that explore the impact of missing data. The analysis of the secondary endpoints is 
considered acceptable. However, the study is uncontrolled. Therefore, seasonal factors could have 
impacted the data, especially with the more subjective endpoints, such as the QoL questionnaire, since 
the patients experience more symptoms of the disease by cold temperatures. Further, this may have 
affected the assessment of disease burden and patient wellbeing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoints 
In the controlled study BIVV009-04, there were 16/22 or 72.7% (95% CI 49.8-89.3) and 3/20 or 15% 
(95% CI 3.2-37.9) responders in the sutimlimab and placebo group, respectively, who met all 3 of the 
components in the composite primary efficacy endpoint (Hb increase at least 1.5 g/dl from baseline; no 
blood transfusions during week 5-26 and no non-permitted CAD treatment during week 5-26). The 
difference was statistically significant (odds ratio of 15.94 [95% CI: 2.88 to 88.04; p<0.001]). There 
was no difference in proportion of subjects free from transfusions or CAD-specific therapy between the 
treatment groups; this could be expected given that patients recruited were free from transfusions 
during the previous six months at baseline and that CAD-specific therapy was prohibited. 
In study BIVV009-03, the primary efficacy endpoint was met in 13/24 (54%) of subjects who fulfilled 
the ‘responder’ criteria with no blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26, no other treatment 
for CAD and Hb level ≥12 g/dL at TAT or increased by ≥2 g/dL from baseline. No subject received a 
different CAD specific therapy during Part A (for two subjects, however, was this unknown).  
Taken together, the primary endpoints in both phase 3 studies are considered to support that 
sutimlimab provides an increase in Hb of clear clinical relevance in a symptomatic CAD population with 
moderate to severe anaemia at baseline. With regard to need for transfusions, the decision was left at 
the investigator’s discretion according to clinical practice and thus transfusion was not conducted 
strictly according to the criteria set at baseline. The overall results for this parameter were 
nevertheless well in line with the change in Hb levels and the overall efficacy results is not deemed 
sensitive to variation in factors triggering the transfusion decision for included subjects.    
Secondary endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint results are supported by the secondary efficacy endpoints from both 
studies, with an increase in Hb levels, a decrease in markers of haemolysis and an increase in QoL 
measures such as the FACIT-Fatigue score. In study BIVV009-04, the LS mean change from baseline 
in haemoglobin at treatment assessment timepoint was 2.66 g/dL (95% CI: 2.09 to 3.22) and 0.09 
g/dL (95% CI: -0.50 to 0.68) for sutimlimab and placebo, respectively. The LS mean difference was 
2.56 g/dL (p<0.001; 95% CI: 1.75 to 3.38). Over a quarter (27%) of the patients had a mean Hb 
increase >3 g/dL. There appears to be a rapid increase in mean Hb in the sutimlimab groups with 
sustained levels throughout the 26 weeks of the study. Despite the increase, the mean values appear 
to fluctuate around the lower limit of normal range in Hb. Thus, it appears that despite having a clear 
effect of treatment, a large proportion of patients do not have their Hb levels fully restored. 
For markers of haemolysis, there was a clear and rapid decrease in bilirubin and a decrease, albeit of a 
smaller magnitude than bilirubin, for LDH in study BIVV009-04; there was no decrease for any of these 
markers in the placebo group. In study BIVV009-03, mean bilirubin levels decreased substantially at 
the week 1 measurement and remained low throughout the 26 weeks; however, for LDH, despite a 
decrease, mean values remained above the upper limit of normal throughout Part A. Despite the mean 
increase in Hb and the mean decrease in bilirubin in the study population, a minority of patients (9/24) 
reached at least 12 g/dl; this is likely due to ongoing haemolysis given that the majority of subjects 
continued to have non-detectable levels of haptoglobin at week 26.  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 98/135 
 
 
 
The LS mean change in FACIT-Fatigue score in study BIVV009-04 showed an increase of 10.83 points 
(95% CI: 7.45 to 14.22) in the sutimlimab group and 1.91 points (95% CI: -1.65 to 5.46) in the 
placebo group. Similar, in study BIVV009-03, there was a mean increase of 13.03 points in the FACIT-
Fatigue score (based on data from 17 subjects) during the main study part. It is agreed with the 
Applicant that the increases in the sutimlimab groups could be considered clinically relevant. 
In study BIVV009-03, 17/24 or 71% received no transfusions during week 5-26. Although all subjects 
included were mandated to have received at least one RBC transfusion during the 6 months before 
study entry, a large proportion of subjects had a low need of transfusions before study entry but were 
given relatively many RBC transfusions during the 6-week screening period before starting sutimlimab 
treatment. Nevertheless, the large proportion of transfusion-free subjects during the main period is 
considered to support efficacy of sutimlimab and is in line with the increase in Hb levels. 
Protocol deviations 
In study BIVV009-04, major protocol deviations were reported in 16/20 or 80% of subjects in the 
placebo group and 14/22 or 64% in the sutimlimab group. Use of prohibited medication was the most 
frequently reported major deviation and was reported in 6/22 subjects in the sutimlimab group and 
4/20 in the placebo group, followed by deviations relating to dosing or administering investigational 
product and study conduct. One patient in each group had a deviation relating to the primary efficacy 
endpoint and in both cases, this concerned missing ≥2 consecutive or 3 intermittent doses. For study 
BIVV009-04 Part B, there were 8/37 or 21.6% who received prohibited medication. There were no 
major protocol deviations relating to prohibited medication in study BIVV009-03 Part A, however, in 
the extension part of study BIVV009-03 (Part B), there were 8/22 or 36% of patients who had use of 
prohibited medication reported as a major protocol deviation. Since the type of prohibited medication 
(which includes CAD specific products as well as dose changes of more general anaemic treatments 
such as folate and iron) could impact the efficacy assessment, the MAH was asked to clarify the use of 
prohibited medication in both study BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04. The applicant has provided 
summaries of concomitant prohibited medication and sensitivity analyses as requested. The estimated 
treatment effects are considered robust. 
PD endpoints 
For both phase 3 studies, the pharmacodynamic assessments including mean CP, total C4, C1q and 
C1s support that the classical complement pathway was inhibited with restoration of complement 
components but without an impact on the C1q levels. The utility of CH50 levels is less clear; these 
levels are expected to be low due to consumption with ongoing complement activity at baseline, and 
then be low with inhibited classical pathway activity during sutimlimab treatment. There are no 
consistent findings in the PD measurements that support any differences between those who received 
6.5 g and 7.5 g sutimlimab respectively.  
Non-responders 
In study BIVV009-04, 6/22 patients in the sutimlimab group were non-responders, three of whom 
discontinued early due to TEAEs. For the remaining three subjects, some improvements in 
haemoglobin levels and/or bilirubin are described; one however had RBC transfusion and the two 
others did not reach the haemoglobin level threshold. For study BIVV009-03, 11/24 subjects were non-
responders. Some improvement in Hb and/or bilirubin was reported in six; two discontinued early and 
three patients had decreases in Hb/no normalisation of bilirubin/no change in FACIT-Fatigue.  
Long-term efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

In line with the previous CHMP Protocol Assistance, maintenance of any initial effect over at least 12 
months should be demonstrated. Interim analysis of extension parts (‘Part B’) of both phase 3 studies 
have been provided. 
The BIVV009-04 Part B was an open-label extension study for patients who continued on study drug 
for 1 year after last patient completed Part A to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability and to 
investigate the durability of response during long-term treatment with sutimlimab in patients with 
primary CAD. Patients who qualified for the study immediately rolled over from part A into part B by 
receiving a cross-over loading dose, in a blinded manner, at the Week 26 visit. Regarding study 
disposition and baseline data, a total of 37 patients enrolled from Part A, 17 from the sutimlimab group 
and 20 from the placebo group in Part B. 39 patients completed Part A, therefore, 2 patients did not 
enter Part B. Of the 37 enrolled patients, 4 discontinued earlier in part B due to lack of efficacy (n=3) 
and withdraw consent (n=1). As of the cut-off date, median exposure of sutimlimab was 45 weeks in 
Part B and 68 weeks in Part A and B. Thus, the presented Part B data as of the cut-off date includes 
data from 15 patients from the sutimlimab group and 18 from the ex-placebo group in part A (switched 
to open-label sutimlimab at week 26). There was a clear and rapid increase in Hb levels and decrease 
in bilirubin levels among previous placebo-subjects from part A who switched to sutimlimab in part B. 
This effect appears to be maintained during part B, however, late during phase B, mean levels are 
more fluctuating for Hb and levels appear to increase for bilirubin. This is based on very few subjects 
and thus entails a greater uncertainty. The Applicant presented an updated analysis of Hb and 
haemolysis parameters from Part B and presented the number of patients who have been followed for 
at least 52 weeks of sutimlimab treatment. It was confirmed that the effect on haemoglobin and 
bilirubin was retained throughout the study.    
Similar to Hb and bilirubin, a clear and rapid change in FACIT-Fatigue score is noted for those in the 
previous placebo group during part A who were switched to open-label sutimlimab for part B, from a 
mean below 35 at week 26 to a mean above 40 at week 39. There are too few subjects included 
beyond week 87 for any meaningful conclusions but until week 87, the higher mean FACIT Fatigue 
score was maintained. 
For LDH, the decrease during part A in the sutimlimab group appears not to have been fully maintained 
during part B, and interestingly, there appeared to be no clear reduction in LDH during part B among 
those who switched from placebo to sutimlimab. The Applicant was asked to present updated part B 
data on LDH and haptoglobin, including separate graphs plotting mean LDH levels and mean 
haptoglobin values respectively during part B.  
For BIVV009-03 Part B, data from 21 subjects have been presented with the interim report, with a 
median treatment time of 77.6 weeks. Mean Hb and bilirubin levels appear to be maintained during 
part B. FACIT-Fatigue mean, and median, scores remained stable and increased as compared to 
baseline. It is however noted that a large number of patients (8/22) received a prohibited medication 
during part B, and that 6/22 required RBC transfusions. Further, for LDH, there was a clear decrease 
from baseline at week 27 at -111.6 U/L (range -863.0, 449.0; N = 22) but at week 99, the mean 
values were similar as to baseline at -4.50 U/L (range -301.0; 118.0; N = 14). The Applicant was 
asked to present updated data on parameters relevant for efficacy from BIVV009-03 Part B including a 
clear presentation of how many subjects have been treated with sutimlimab for at least 52 weeks. 
The data are provided as requested. In study BIVV009-03 > 90% of participants followed after 52 
weeks.  In BIVV009-04, 35 (90%) participants were followed >52 weeks. 
Further, the LDH findings, that are in line with study BIVV009-04, were addressed, including whether 
this could indicate a return of haemolysis due to loss of efficacy. The applicant presented the final 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

study reports for both studies BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04. The pattern of responses seen is generally 
retained over time and the patients treated with placebo in BIVV009-04 part A caught up with the 
patient is the active arm. The data presented in the final reports are overall consistent with data 
presented with the interim reports. 
Generalisability 
Both phase 3 studies included patients with primary CAD who had moderate to severe haemolytic 
anaemia based on Hb < 10 g/dL and increased haemolytic markers. Thus, all efficacy data pertains to 
such patients. It is thus deemed appropriate to restrict the indication to patients with haemolytic 
anaemia (not all patients with haemolysis). As could be expected given the requirement to have a 
recent RBC transfusion, the population in study BIVV009-03 appears to have a more severe primary 
CAD as compared to study BIVV009-04; the majority of subjects (16/24) in study BIVV009-03 had 
been hospitalised due to CAD within the last 2 years. Based on Hb levels at baseline, however, both 
studies appear to have included a rather wide range of CAD severity. Only a relatively small proportion 
of patients had previously been treated with a specific antibody reducing regimen; however, it is 
recognised that these regimens are not approved for CAD. 
Given the low number of subjects, subgroup analyses are expected to be of limited value. No clear 
difference in effect across age, weight, previous number of transfusions, baseline Hb level or previous 
specific antibody reducing regimens are noted. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The data from the two pivotal phase 3 studies, especially from controlled trial BIVV009-04, in adults 
with primary CAD and moderate to severe haemolytic anaemia are considered to support a clear and 
clinically relevant increase in Hb and a decrease in haemolytic markers. Controlled data further support 
an improvement in symptoms and quality of life.

146.9 years, with a median number of sutimlimab administrations of 56.0 (Range: 2 - 89) and median 
total dose of sutimlimab of 380.25 g (Range: 13.9 – 667.5 g).  
NHV  
The median duration of exposure to sutimlimab among the 96 NHVs exposed to sutimlimab in was 
2.14 (Range: 2.1 – 7.1) weeks with all subjects exposed to sutimlimab for ≥1 week. The total subject-
years of exposure to sutimlimab was 6.8 years, with a median number of sutimlimab administrations of 
1.0 (Range: 1 - 4) and median total dose of sutimlimab of 5.8 g (Range: 0.02 – 32.5 g).  
Other CMD patients 
The median duration of exposure to sutimlimab for the 4 patients with WAIHA in study BIVV009-01 
Part C was 2.29 (Range: 2.3 – 5.3) weeks, BP was 5.29 (Range: 5.1 – 5.4) weeks AMR was 5.29 
(Range: 5.3 – 5.3) weeks and 43.36 (Range: 3.1 – 130.3) weeks for ITP patients.  
The total subject years of exposure for WAIHA patients was 0.2 years, BP 1.0 year, AMR 1.0 year and 
12.8 years for ITP.  
The median number of sutimlimab administrations for WAIHA patients were 2.0 (Range: 2 – 5), BP 5.0 
(Range: 5 – 5), AMR 5.0 (Range: 5 – 5) and ITP 17.5 (Range: 2 – 64).  
The median total dose of sutimlimab for WAIHA patients was 5.65 g (Range: 5.1 – 24.2 g), BP 18.76 g 
(Range: 15.5 – 24.5 g), AMR 20.46 g (Range: 12.9 – 24.3 g) and ITP 119.75 g (Range: 11.0 – 462.5 
g). 
Demographics 
Overall, for CAD patients the mean age at baseline was 68.4 (Range: 46-88), NHV 35.1 (range 19-59) 
and other CMD patients:  WAIHA: 61.0 (Range: 53- 75), BP 73.8 (Range: 47 - 88), AMR 54.5 (Range: 
36 – 77) and ITP 44.4 (Range: 27 - 65) years.  
In CAD patients at baseline, the majority were female 56 of 76 [73.7%], in NHV the majority were 
male (70.8%), in other CMD patients: in WAIHA and BP equally male or female (50%), in BP the 
majority were male (60.0%) and in ITP the majority were female (75.0%).  
For details on demographics, see efficacy part. 
Within the six studies included in the integrated analyses, 208 patients (76 with CAD, 36 patients with 
other CMDs, and 96 NHVs) were exposed to sutimlimab.  Of the 76 patients with CAD, 20 were 
exposed to placebo in BIVV009-04 Part A and then sutimlimab in BIVV009-04 Part B. An additional 22 
NHVs were exposed to placebo 
The demographic profile of subjects across all 6 clinical trials is generally considered representative for 
CAD patients, although ethnicity has not been collected, it was however noted that studies were mostly 
performed in Europe and North America. The average age throughout the studies is deemed 
representative of CAD-patients since a median age of diagnosis in the late 60s to early 70s is common.  
It is also noted that a majority of patients were female (74% vs 26%) across all studies which could at 
least partly reflect the higher prevalence in females reported.

Adverse events 
Total safety population  
Table 25. Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (CAD) 
In CAD patients, a majority of 64 out of 66 experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 1072 TEAEs and 
36 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE assessed as related to sutimlimab.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were infections and infestations 74%, gastrointestinal 
disorders 68%, general disorders and administration site conditions 64%, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders 53%, vascular disorders 52% and skin, subcutaneous tissue disorders 
50%, blood a lymphatic system disorders 49% and nervous system disorders 47%. The most 
frequently reported TEAEs by PT were anaemia 29%, fatigue 28%, arthralgia 26%, hypertension 24%, 
diarrhoea 23%, headache 22% nasopharyngitis and cyanosis 20%, and nausea 18%.  
In NHVs, NHVs experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 47 TEAEs and 11 experienced at least 1 TEAE 
assessed as related to sutimlimab 
In other CMD patients, a majority of patients experienced 1 TEAE across all subgroups. However, only 
two patients in the BP group and one patient in the ITP group experienced TEAEs that were assessed 
as related to sutimlimab. The applicant has satisfactorily clarified how the data presentation was 
performed.

Placebo-controlled data 
Overall, all except 1 patient in the sutimlimab group had at least 1 TEAE (sutimlimab 95.5% and 
placebo 100%), but a greater number of TEAEs were reported in the sutimlimab group than in the 
placebo group (146 versus 90 events). The incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the sutimlimab 
group than in the placebo group TEAEs (8 [36.4%] versus 4 [20.0%]), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (22.7% versus 
15.0%), TESAEs (3 [13.6%] versus 1 [5.0%]), and TEAEs within 24 hours of start of infusion (11 
[50.0%] versus 7 [35.0%]). Three (13.6%) patients in the sutimlimab group and no patient in the 
placebo group discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. There were no deaths. The incidences were 
generally similar in the sutimlimab and placebo groups for Grade ≥3 infections (2 [9.1%] and 1 
[5.0%]), TESAEs of infection (1 [4.5%] and 1 [5.0%]), related TESAEs (1 [4.5%] and 0%) and 
thromboembolic events (1 [4.5%] and 0%).  
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported most frequently (>20% of patients in either group) in the 
SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions, infections and infestations, injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, and vascular disorders.  
Treatment-emergent AEs (by PT) reported more frequently in patients in the sutimlimab group than in 
the placebo group (≥2 patient difference in incidence) were hypertension (5 [22.7%] sutimlimab and 
0% placebo), headache (5 [22.7%] and 2 [10.0%]), Raynaud’s phenomenon (4 [18.2%] and 0%), 
rhinitis (4 [18.2%] and 0%), cyanosis (all PTs corresponded to investigator term acrocyanosis) (3 
[13.6%] and 0%), constipation (2 [9.1%] and 0%), insomnia 2 [9.1%] and 0%), rash (2 [9.1%] and 
0%) and vaccination complication (2 [9.1%] and 0%).  
Treatment-emergent AEs (by PT) reported less frequently in the sutimlimab group than in the placebo 
group (≥2 patient difference in incidence) were anaemia (2 [9.1%] sutimlimab and 4 [20.0%] 
placebo), diarrhoea (2 [9.1%] and 4 [20.0%]), upper respiratory tract infection (1 [4.5%] and 3 
[15.0%]), haemolysis (0% and 2 [10.0%]), sciatica (0% and 2 [10.0%]), and vomiting (0% and 2 
[10.0%]).  
Adverse drug reaction table: 
The applicant provided an updated ADR table from the integrated safety data from the 2 completed 
Phase 3 clinical studies, BIVV009-03 Part A and Part B and BIVV009-04 Part A and Part B. A modified 
Bradford Hill causality framework was applied, supported by using the WHO UMC Causality assessment 
and Threshold Criteria on TEAEs for the cut off criteria to identify the ADRs. 
Overall, in BIVV009-04 Part A, there were a greater number of TEAE reported in the sutimlimab group 
than in the placebo group (146 vs 90 events). The incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the 
sutimlimab group than in the placebo group 36% vs 20%, Grade≥3 TEAE 23% vs 15%, TESAEs 14% 
vs 5% and TEAEs within 24 hours of start of infusion 50% vs 35%.   
The most frequently TEAEs reported by SOC compared to placebo were gastrointestinal disorders 50% 
vs 35%, vascular disorders 41% vs 0%, general disorders and administration site conditions 41% vs 
35%, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 32% vs 20% and nervous system disorders 32% vs 
25%. Of these the imbalance in vascular disorders is the most striking finding with zero cases in the 
placebo group and almost half of the patients in the test group affected. The events were 
hypertension, Raynaud’s phenomenon and cyanosis.

Adverse events of special interest 
Thromboembolic events 
In CAD patients, thromboembolic events, 5 (7.6%) patients experienced a total of 5 TEAEs of a 
thromboembolic event which included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (n=1), device-related 
thrombosis (n=1), peripheral artery thrombosis (n=1), transient ischemic attack (n=1), and deep vein 
thrombosis (n=1). In BIVV009-03 Part B, one patient had reported a serious thromboembolic event of 
peripheral artery thrombosis and one patient had a nonserious thromboembolic event of device-related 
thrombosis. Both events were assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to sutimlimab. In BIVV009-
04, three patients experienced treatment-emergent thromboembolic events (cerebral venous 
thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis and transient ischemic attack). The event of cerebral venous 
thrombosis was assessed as related to treatment. 
In other CMD patients, no thromboembolic events were observed.  
 Treatment-emergent adverse events with onset within 24 hours of infusion 
In CAD patients, 35 of 66 (53.0%) patients with CAD experienced a total of 61 TEAEs within 24 hours 
of infusion. The most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred within 24 hours of the start of infusion 
of sutimlimab by PT were infusion-related reaction 6%, and hypertension and nausea 5%.  
The most common TEAEs by SOC that occurred within 24 hours were general disorders and 
administration site conditions, gastrointestinal disorders and injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, vascular disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and nervous system 
disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and infections and infestations.  
A total of 23 patients with CAD were exposed to at least 1 undiluted infusion of sutimlimab in study 
BIVV009-04 Part B and 43.5 3% experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 24  TEAEs within 24 hours 
of infusion. None of these patients discontinued from the study.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events by time of onset 
CAD patients 
Overall, among the 66 patients with CAD, the number of patients with at least 1 TEAE within a given 
time interval (<6 months, 6 to <12 months, 12 to <18 months, 18 to <24 months, 24 to <30 months, 
30 to <36 months, 36 to <42 months, and ≥42 months) ranged from 1 to 55 patients with a varying 
incidence based on the number of patients followed within a given interval.  
The events of anaemia appeared to be evenly distributed over time through all time intervals, though a 
slightly higher number of patients experienced anaemia in the 35 - <45-week interval. The majority of 
the events of anaemia were reported to be due to underlying cold agglutinin disease. The frequency of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE within the SOC of infections and infestation was generally similar across 
all time intervals. There were no serious TEAEs of hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis or a TESAE 
suggestive of a potential hypersensitivity reaction.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are a well-recognized risk of monoclonal antibody therapies. 
Sutimlimab dose times were recorded for each day dosing, however, the specific time of TEAE onset 
was not recorded for every TEAE. Therefore, the precise temporal relationship between dose 
administration and TEAE onset could not be determined in all cases. Treatment-emergent AEs with 
onset time within 24 hours of infusion were flagged. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 107/135 
 
 
 
Overall, 27 CAD patients experienced a total of 31 TEAEs identified as events that may be suggestive 
of potential hypersensitivity reaction. Of the 31 TEAEs, 17 events were assessed as related to 
sutimlimab by the Investigator. Ten of the patients experienced TEAEs within 24 hours of infusion.  
One of the hypersensitivity reactions led to sutimlimab discontinuation (infusion related reaction). 
Overall, there were no serious TEAEs of hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis or a TESAE suggestive 
of a potential hypersensitivity reaction reported in either treatment group.  
In NHVs, two patients experienced TEAEs that were nonserious where one was deemed possibly 
related to sutimlimab. No TEAEs suggestive of a serious hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis were 
reported among the NHVs who were exposed to sutimlimab. 
In other CMD patients, nonserious TEAEs suggestive of potential hypersensitivity reactions associated 
with sutimlimab administration were reported but no serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactic 
reactions were identified.  
Treatment-emergent infections 
The risks associated with long-term pharmacological inhibition of the proximal portion of the classical 
complement system are presently unknown. Subjects with inherited deficiencies of classical 
complement pathway components have an increased risk of infections with a variety of encapsulated 
bacterial organisms. Two marketed terminal complement pathway inhibitors, eculizumab and 
ravulizumab-cwvz, are labelled with a warning for an increased risk of meningococcal infections, which 
is thought to be due to C5 inhibition preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex which 
is essential to host defence against this encapsulated bacterium.  
CAD patients 
Treatment-emergent AEs of infections were defined as all TEAEs listed within the SOC of infections and 
infestations. Of the 66 patients in the CAD Safety Analysis Set, 49 (74.2%) experienced at least 1 
TEAE of infection.  
Treatment-emergent AEs of infection reported by >2 of the 66 patients included:  
• 
• 
nasopharyngitis (13 [19.7%] patients)  
upper respiratory tract infection (10 [15.2%] patients)  
•  Urinary tract infection (8 [10.6%] patients) 
•  Cystitis, gastroenteritis, rhinitis (7 [10.6%] patients) 
• 
Escherichia urinary tract infection (4 [6.1%] patients) 
•  Oral herpes, respiratory tract infection, tooth infection, urinary tract infection bacterial (3 
[4.5%] patients) 
Diverticulitis, eye infection, Herpes zoster, influenza, otitis externa, pneumonia, sinusitis, skin candida, 
viral infection (2 [3.0%] patients) Treatment-emergent AEs of infection ≥Grade 3 were reported for 13 
of the 66 (19.7%) patients including:  
•  Urinary tract infection (4 [6.1%] patients) 
•  Appendicitis, asymptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, erysipelas, Escherichia sepsis, 
febrile infection, Herpes zoster, pneumococcal sepsis, Klebsiella pneumonia, respiratory tract 
infection, Staphylococcal skin infection, Streptococcal sepsis, urinary tract infection bacterial, 
urosepsis, and viral infection (1 [1.5%] patients each) 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 108/135 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent SAEs of infections were reported for 10 of the 66 (15.2%) patients including: 
Appendicitis, asymptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, erysipelas, Escherichia sepsis, febrile 
infection, Herpes zoster, pneumococcal sepsis, Klebsiella pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, 
Streptococcal sepsis, urinary tract infection, urinary tract infection bacterial, urosepsis, viral infection, 
Staphylococcal wound infection (1 [1.5%] patients each) 
No reports of meningococcal infection, meningitis, or infections were identified from the medical review 
of the AE listings and available information from the global safety database. The majority of patients 
with serious infections had underlying risk factors for infection.  
One patient died due to an event of pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient was 
hospitalized with worsening general condition and acrocyanosis and Klebsiella pneumonia. Fourteen 
days after the last dose of sutimlimab, the patient died due to Klebsiella pneumonia. 
The applicant has provided literature indicating that the risk of meningococcal infection with a selective 
C1s inhibitor such as sutimlimab is expected to be lower compared to terminal inhibitors (mainly C5b-
C8 components). Nevertheless, a causal link between the serious infections recorded in the present 
studies and sutimlimab cannot be excluded. Consequently, the Applicant has agreed to include 
`serious infections ´ as an important identified risk which is endorsed.  
Other CMD patients 
Treatment-emergent AEs of infections were defined as all TEAEs listed within the SOC of infections and 
infestations. No patients with WAIHA experienced a TEAE of infection. Four of the 10 (40.0%) patients 
with BP experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection including nasopharyngitis (3 [30.0%] patients), and 
rhinitis and urinary tract infection (1 [10.0%] patient each). One of the 10 (10.0%) patient with AMR 
experienced a TEAE of infection (rhinitis).  
•  Seven of the 12 (58.3%) patients with ITP experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection including 
viral upper respiratory tract infection (3 [25.0%] patients), viral gastroenteritis and sinusitis (2 
[16.7%] patients each), and bacterial bronchitis, diverticulitis, Herpes simplex, infected dermal 
cyst, nasopharyngitis, suspected Covid-19, tooth infection, and upper respiratory tract infection 
(1 [8.3%] patient each).  
In NHVs, the type and frequency of infections were consistent with that seen in a healthy study 
population. 
In the context of serious infections possible co-treatment with other substances weakening the 
immune system must be considered. In both BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04, specific therapies to reduce 
antibody production, such as rituximab and rituximab combination therapies, were prohibited but such 
treatment could else be considered for these patients. The applicant has sufficiently clarified the 
information regarding the patients that received prohibited medications during the studies and the 
SmPC currently includes a statement in 5.1 that rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic 
agents and this is deemed appropriate. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
CAD patients 
Overall, 25 of 66 (37.9%) patients experienced a total of 68 TESAEs. The SOCs with TESAEs included:  
infections and infestations (10 of 66 [15.2%] patients)  
vascular disorders (5 of 66 [7.6%] patients each) 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022

Blood and lymphatic system disorders; hepatobiliary disorders; and neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (4 of 66 [6.1%] patients each) 
Cardiac disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; and nervous system disorders (3 of 66 [4.5%] 
patients each)  
General disorders and administration site conditions (2 of 66 [3.0%] patients) 
Congenital, familial and genetic disorders; eye disorders; investigations; renal and urinary 
disorders (1 of 66 [1.5%] patients each) 
All TESAEs by PT were reported for 1 of 66 (1.5%) patients except for urosepsis which was reported by 
2 of 66 (3.0%) patients.  
Thirty-one of the 66 CAD patients experienced at least 1 TEAE ≥Grade 3 in severity and 13 
experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection ≥Grade 3 in severity. Of the 66 patients, 25 experienced a 
total of 68 TESAEs, 4 patients experienced at least 1 TESAE assessed by the investigator as related to 
sutimlimab, and 10 patients experienced at least 1 TESAE of infection.  
BIVV009-03 
Fifteen of the 24 (62.5%) patients experienced at least 1 TESAE for a total of 53 TESAEs. The SOCs 
with the most TESAEs were infection and infestations (8 of 24 [33.3%] patients); blood and lymphatic 
system disorders; cardiac disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; hepatobiliary disorders; vascular 
disorders; and neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (3 of 24 
[12.5%] patients each); general disorders and administration site conditions and nervous system 
disorders (2 of 24 [8.3%] patients each). All TESAEs were reported for 1 of 24 (4.2%) patients each 
except for cyanosis (acrocyanosis) which was reported by 2 of 24 (8.3%) patients. One of the TESAEs 
(an event of viral infection) were assessed by the investigator as related to sutimlimab treatment (in 
Part B).  
BIVV009-04 Parts A and B 
Four of the 22 (18.2%) patients in the sutimlimab group experienced at least 1 TESAE for a total of 5 
TESAEs. One elderly patient in the sutimlimab group had a TESAE of Grade 3 PT cerebral venous 
thrombosis on Day 86. Study drug was temporarily interrupted due to the event. The event resolved 
on Day 88 after treatment with antithrombotic agents and sutimlimab was resumed on Day 99. This 
TESAE was assessed by the Investigator as related to sutimlimab. Additionally, a patient  experienced 
a TESAE of Raynaud’s phenomenon associated with extremity necrosis that required amputation of all 
digits on both hands and bilateral below knee amputation. The TESAE was assessed by the Investigator 
as not related to the study treatment. Six of the 20 (5.4%) patients in the placebo group reported a 
total of 10 TESAEs. Two patients had received placebo during Part A of the study. One patient 
experienced a TESAE of hip fracture as a consequence of accidental fall and a TESAE of hypertension. 
The event of hypertension was assessed as related to the sutimlimab by the Investigator.  
NHV  
No NHVs experienced a TESAE. 
Other CMD patients 
No patient with WAIHA or AMR exposed to sutimlimab experienced a TESAE. 
Of the 12 patients with ITP exposed to sutimlimab, 4 (33.3%) experienced 5 TESAEs including events 
of thrombocytopenia, diverticulitis, migraine, dural arteriovenous fistula, petechiae.

Deaths 
Three fatal events were observed in study BIVV009-03 and one fatal event in study BIVV009-04.  In 
BIVV009-03 Part A, a patient experienced a gastrointestinal haemorrhage and was later diagnosed 
with hepatic cancer and withdrawn from the study and later died. This event was deemed not related 
to sutimlimab. In BIVV009-03 Part B, one patient had a TESAE of Klebsiella pneumonia on day 949 and 
died on day 960. Further, one patient in BIVV009-03 Part B with a complex medical history 
experienced a TESAE reported as “terminal aggravation of cold type haemolytic anaemia” and the 
patient later died. Neither of the fatal events in Part B were deemed as related to sutimlimab.   
In addition, another fatal event was observed in a BP patient that died due to cardiac failure and was 
deemed unlikely related to sutimlimab. 
Malignancy 
A single case of malignancy, deemed not related to treatment, was observed (see death above). 
Nevertheless, on request, the applicant has provided evidence indicating limited clinical and pre-clinical 
data to support a causal relationship between sutimlimab and malignancy 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
CAD patients 
PCSA chemistry laboratory values reported for ≥20% of patients included blood urea nitrogen ≥10.7 
mmol/L (16of 66 [24.2%] patients), direct bilirubin >1.5 x ULN (30 of 66 [45.5%] patients), and total 
bilirubin >1.5 x ULN (34 of 76 [44.7%] patients). High PCSA direct bilirubin values were either 
transient, isolated, or occurred in study participants with other high direct bilirubin values prior to 
study drug administration. Abnormalities in total bilirubin are nevertheless not unanticipated as a 
result of the extravascular and sometimes intravascular haemolytic process seen with CAD and the 
patients needed to have total bilirubin > ULN at screening in order to qualify for the study. 
In BIVV009-03, two patients with high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values during 
screening had persistent high PCSA BUN and creatinine values postbaseline which were intermittently 
above the highest screening value of unclear aetiology. One patient had a nonserious Grade 2 TEAE of 
chronic kidney disease (reported as chronic renal insufficiency - creatinine increased) that was 
assessed by the Investigator as not related to sutimlimab. Otherwise, the majority of high PCSA BUN 
values were transient and isolated or intermittent with interval improvements.  
NHV  
There were no apparent clinically relevant trends in clinical chemistry parameters in the clinical studies 
in NHVs. Sporadic out-of-range parameters were observed in individual patients at isolated timepoints.  
The majority of PCSA chemistry values were isolated findings. One NHV had high total bilirubin values 
of unknown aetiology during screening, baseline, and every postbaseline assessment that increased on 
Days 1, 8, and 15. 
One patient in the TNT009-02 study exposed to sutimlimab 75 mg/kg experienced a nonserious Grade 
1 TEAE of increased alanine aminotransferase that was assessed as possibly related to study 
treatment. This patient’s abnormal ALT values did not meet the PCSA criteria for ALT.   
Other CMD patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 111/135 
 
 
 
Overall, the PCSA chemistry values in patients with other CMDs were isolated or transient or consistent 
with the underlying disease indication (i.e., elevated bilirubin in patients with WAIHA with haemolysis 
or elevated creatinine in patients with renal allografts). 
Haematology 
CAD patients 
Overall, potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSA) haematology laboratory values reported 
for ≥20% of patients included haematocrit ≤30% (52 of 73 [71.2%] patients), haemoglobin ≤10 g/dL 
(52 of 76 [68.4%] patients]), and lymphocytes <0.8 x 109/L (35 of 75 [46.7%] patients) and 
neutrophils <1.5 ×109/L (16 of 75 [21.3%] patients). Patients needed to have haemoglobin ≤10 g/dL 
at screening to qualify for the study and it is anticipated that the level would vary with disease 
fluctuations and although there was an increase in haemoglobin in most patients as a treatment effect 
there was variability in response and certain non-responders recorded (see efficacy part). 
Low values for leukocytes counts were observed in BIVV009-03 (6/24 [25.0%]) and BIVV009-04 in the 
sutimlimab group (3/22 [113.6%]) with 2/20 [10.0%] observed case in the placebo group (1/20). For 
neutrophil counts, low values were observed in BIVV009-03 (7/24 [25.0%]) and BIVV009-04 (43/22 
[29.2%]), compared to in the placebo-group (5/19 [26.3%]). Notably the decreases appeared 
transient as they were observed in the first part of the study only.   
Other CMD patients and NHV  
In NHVs, there were no clinically relevant trends observed. In patients with WAIHA, BP, and AMR there 
were no clinically meaningful patterns or trends observed in mean haematology laboratory values, 
change from baseline and shifts as discussed in the BIVV009-01 Part C CSR. Of note, there was a 
minor increase in the peripheral eosinophil count noted in patients with BP, though the difference was 
not clinically significant.  
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  
Due to the mechanism of action of sutimlimab and the increased incidence of SLE in patients with 
congenital deficiencies of components of the classical complement pathway, standard clinical 
biomarkers related to SLE (e.g., double-stranded DNA) and other autoimmune disorders were 
incorporated into the study design of all studies in the sutimlimab clinical development program. The 
clinical biomarkers used for SLE, while also including some related to other autoimmune disorders, are 
broadly referenced as “SLE panel” parameters. Individual studies assessed different SLE panel 
parameters based on the parameters included in the given study central or local laboratory SLE panel 
test. The clinical utility and predictive value of positive SLE panel autoantibodies in the absence of 
clinical signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease is unknown as the positive predictive value may 
vary in different populations and by laboratory parameter. 
In CAD patients, 27 of 76 had all negative results or had all missing results prior to sutimlimab 
exposure and 49 of 76 had at least 1 positive SLE panel parameter result prior to sutimlimab exposure. 
Eight out of 76 patients were positive for any post-baseline assessment of SLE parameter and seven 
were positive for at least 1 SLE panel parameter at the last postbaseline evaluation.  
In BIV009-04 Part A, prior to receiving the study drug, 13 patients in the sutimlimab group and 16 
patients in the placebo group had ≥1 positive value for an SLE parameter and 9 patients in sutimlimab 
group and 4 patients in placebo group were negative or had missing values for all SLE panel 
parameters. In the patients who were negative or had all missing SLE panel assessments prior to 
receiving study drug, 3 of 9 (33.3%) patients in the sutimlimab group and 1 of 4 (25.0%) patients in 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 112/135 
 
 
 
the placebo group switched from negative or missing at baseline to positive for ≥1 SLE parameter at 
any post baseline assessment. Furthermore, two of the 4 patients exposed to placebo in Part A and 
then sutimlimab in Part B were negative in all SLE panel parameters prior to exposure had at least 1 
positive SLE panel parameter result at any time postbaseline and 1 was positive at the last 
postbaseline evaluation. 
In other CMD patients, overall, there were some intermittent changes from negative to positive or from 
positive to negative in patients with other CMDs exposed to sutimlimab without any clinical correlate. 
Although there were some observed positive SLE panel parameters, the values seem to be variable 
over time and without any obvious pattern. In addition, none of the patients who shifted from being 
negative at baseline to being positive post baseline for the SLE parameter panel, developed SLE.  
Immunogenicity 
CAD patients 
One patient with primary CAD had an ADA positive test result after sutimlimab dosing at the end-of-
treatment assessment. This patient had multiple nonserious TEAEs reported which were assessed by 
the Investigator as unlikely related to study drug and resolved prior to the ADA positive test result. 
The patient received a total of 5 doses of sutimlimab and completed the study. The TEAEs in this 
patient were not suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions. 
Two patients enrolled in the BIVV009-03 and 6 patients enrolled in the BIVV009-04 developed 
treatment-emergent ADAs. The potential presence of treatment-emergent ADAs does not appear to 
have an impact on the total exposure or PD response of sutimlimab.  
NHV  
Antidrug antibody data are available in the CSRs for the studies conducted in NHVs. Overall, although 
several NHVs had a positive ADA test result after exposure to sutimlimab, sutimlimab exposure did not 
appear to have a clinical impact on the safety profile of sutimlimab administration in NHVs. 
Other CMD patients 
Three patients with AMR had an ADA positive test result after sutimlimab dosing at the end of 
treatment assessment. One of these patients also had a positive ADA test at baseline but the titer 
increased at the end of treatment assessment. Overall, the presence of a positive ADA test did not 
appear to impact the safety profile of sutimlimab administration in WAIHA, BP, or AMR patients. 
Overall, in CAD patients, from the clinical safety summary, the applicant stated that one patient with 
primary CAD in BIVV009-01 had an ADA positive result. This patient had multiple nonserious TEAEs 
reported which were assessed by the Investigator as unlikely related to study drug and resolved prior 
to the ADA positive test result. One patient in BIVV009-03 and three patients in BIVV009-04 developed 
treatment-emergent ADAs.  
In other CMD patients, three patients with AMR had ADA positive test results.  
Vital signs 
CAD patients 
The majority of PCSA vital sign values were consistent with other pre-treatment assessments or 
underlying medical history (ie, history of hypertension or hypotension).  
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 113/135 
 
 
 
o  Among the 76 patients with CAD, PCSA high/increased or low/decreased systolic blood 
pressure changes were reported for 22 of 76 (28.9%) and 25 of 76 (32.9%) patients, 
respectively.  
o  Potentially clinically significant high/increased or low/decreased diastolic blood pressure 
changes were reported for 12 of 76 (15.8%) and 28 of 76 (36.8%) patients, respectively. 
o  Potentially clinically significant high/increased heart rates were reported for 22 of 76 (28.9%) 
patients and PCSA low/decreased heart rates were reported for 28 of 76 (36.8%) patients. 
Two patients with CAD without a history of hypertension (1 in BIVV009-03 and 1 in BIVV009-04 Part 
A) experienced a TEAE of increased blood pressure. The increased blood pressure was assessed by the 
Investigator as related to the study drug in 1 of the 2 patients.  
A total of 16 of 76 (21%) patients with CAD reported TEAEs of hypertension:  
o  1 (1.3%) patient reported a TEAE of essential hypertension:  
o  5 patients had pre-existing medical history of hypertension 
o  6 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE of hypertension that was assessed by the Investigator 
as related to sutimlimab 
o  6 had reported at least 1 PCSA values for high blood pressure (either systolic or diastolic). 
As of the data cut-off date, no apparent trend was observed in temperature, heart rate, or respiratory 
rate over the duration of treatment. 
NHVs 
There were no apparent clinically meaningful pattern or trend in vital signs observed. 
Other CMD patients 
The majority of PCSA vital sign findings in patients with other CMDs were transient and consistent with 
other predosing values or consistent with underlying medical history. Overall, there were no clinically 
relevant trends observed in vital sign data. 
In CAD patients, potentially clinically significant increased blood pressure changes were reported in 10 
subjects and decreased in 22 patients. Potentially clinically significant high/increased heart rates were 
reported for 17/71 patients and PCSA low/decreased heart rates were reported for 27/71 patients. Two 
patients without previous history of hypertension experienced TEAE of increased blood pressure and 
one case was deemed related to study drug. A total of 13/76 patients reported TEAE of hypertension.  
Safety in special populations 
Age  
Overall, 51 of 76 (67.1%) patients were ≥65 years of age and 25 of 76 (32.9%) were <65 years of 
age. Overall, among the CAD Safety Analysis Set, the mean age at baseline was 68.4 (Range: 46 – 88) 
years, with the majority (51 of 76 [67.1%]) patients ≥65 years old. A total of 22 of 23 (95.7%) 
patients <65 years old experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 370 TEAEs. A total of 42 of 43 
(97.7%) patients ≥65 years old experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 702 TEAEs.  
Gender  
Overall, 18 of 66 (27.3%) patients were male and 48 of 66 (72.7%) patients were female. Each of the 
18 male patients experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 313 TEAEs. A total of 46 of 48 (95.8%) 
Assessment report

female patients experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 759 TEAEs. Male patients had a higher 
frequency of TEAEs than female patients within e.g., the SOC of of blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (61.1% versus 43.8%), cardiac disorders (27.8% versus 16.7%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(83.3% versus 62.5%).,. Overall, although there were some differences in the distribution of TEAEs by 
gender, many of these differences were consistent with patterns that might be attributed to the 
patient’s gender (ie, increased risk of urinary tract infections in female patients or cardiac disease in 
male patients).  
Race  
Due to varying global regulations, race information was not collected for 49 of the 66patients in the 
CAD Analysis Set. Of 17 patients with race information collected, 7 were white and 10 were Asian. Six 
(85.7%) white patients experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 92 TEAEs. All Asian patients 
experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 141 TEAEs. 
Overall, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion due to small numbers of patients in each 
age/gender/race group. On the other hand, no alarming safety related findings were found in either of 
these subgroups. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
There is limited data available for the safety of sutimlimab in pregnant and/or lactating women.  
Immunological events 
Please see above. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
For biologic therapies, drug-drug interaction studies are usually not applicable based on mechanisms of 
degradation and elimination and hence were not conducted by the applicant. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
CAD patients 
One of the 24 (4.2%) patients in BIVV009-03 Part A was withdrawn from the study due to a pre-
treatment SAE with onset during the screening period on Day -8 prior to the first dose of study drug. 
This patient also developed TESAE of arthralgia, which was assessed by the Investigator as unrelated 
to sutimlimab. This event did not result in discontinuation of study treatment.  
Another patient in BIVV009-03 Part B was withdrawn from the study due to TESAEs of cyanosis 
(acrocyanosis) and Klebsiella pneumonia on day 949. The patient received the last dose of study drug 
on day 946. Patient died from Klebsiella pneumonia on day 960. Both events were assessed as not 
related to sutimlimab by the Investigator.  
Overall, 9 of the 66 (13.6%) patients in the CAD Safety Analysis Set discontinued treatment with 
sutimlimab or withdrew from the study due to at least 1 TEAE/TESAE.  
NHV 
Overall, 1 of the 96 (1.0%) NHVs discontinued treatment and was discontinued from the study due to 
a TEAE. The patient discontinued from the study due to a vasovagal response prior to planned study 
treatment administration.  
Other CMD patients 
Assessment report

No patients with AMR or ITP exposed to sutimlimab discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. One patient 
with WAIHA permanently discontinued study treatment due to a Grade 2 nonserious TEAE of 
haemolysis with an onset on Day 9.  
Overall, the pattern of AEs leading to discontinuations is not unexpected. 
Post marketing experience 
This product has not yet been marketed in the European Union or in any other countries.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of sutimlimab has been assessed in 6 clinical studies, including four Phase 1 studies 
and two Phase 3 studies. The studies were conducted to support the indication  for the treatment of 
haemolytic anaemia in adult patients with CAD and all studies are completed. Of note, the Applicant 
has presented an integrated safety overview with CAD patients only obtained from the BIVV009-03 
and BIVV009-04 studies and hence only encompassing 66 patients.  
In general, presentation of safety data in the application is considered acceptable. The main limitations 
relating to the safety data is the small number of patients treated with sutimlimab and only one of the 
studies conducted in CAD-patients was placebo controlled. However, the difficulty to collect more 
comprehensive data is acknowledged given the rareness of the disease.  
This assessment focuses on the pools for integrated analysis concerning the CAD, NHV (normal healthy 
volunteers) and other CMD (complement mediated disorders) patients.  
Patient exposure 
Overall, within the six studies included in the integrated analyses, 208 subjects have participated (76 
with CAD, 36 patients with other CMDs, and 96 NHVs). Of the 76 patients with CAD, 20 were exposed 
to placebo in BIVV009-04 Part A and then sutimlimab in BIVV009-04 Part B. An additional 22 NHVs 
were exposed to placebo.  
The demographic profile of subjects across all 6 clinical trials is generally considered representative for 
CAD patients, although ethnicity has not been collected; it is however noted that the studies were 
mostly performed in Europe and North America.  
The average age throughout the studies is deemed representative of CAD-patients since a median age 
of diagnosis late 60s to early 70s is common. It is also noted that a majority of patients were female 
(74% vs 26%) across all studies and for all patients.  
Sutimlimab is intended for long-term treatment of CAD. However, only 43 patients were exposed to 
sutimlimab over 55 weeks and 18 patients over 145 weeks in the CAD-population. Both the single-
armed BIVV009-03 and open-label study part of BIVV009-04 contributes with long-time data (up to 52 
weeks). Supportive safety data are available from other phase 1 studies in other CMD patients or in 
healthy volunteers. Although small and single armed they add to the total safety data base. The 
applicant has provided the final CSRs for the completed BIVV009-01E (duration of study was 2.5 
years), BIVV009-03 Part B (duration of study was 2 years) and BIVV009-04 Part B studies (duration of 
study was 1 year) along with an RMP update and Cadence registry protocol. The Applicant has also 
presented an integrated safety analysis with CAD patients obtained from studies BIVV009-03 and 
BIVV009-04 that includes 66 patients out of the total 76 CAD patients. 
Adverse events - total safety population 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 116/135 
 
 
 
A majority of CAD patients (64 of 66) experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 1072 TEAEs and 36 
patients experienced at least 1 TEAE assessed as related to sutimlimab. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs by SOC were infections and infestations 74%, gastrointestinal disorders 68%, general disorders 
and administration site conditions 64%, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 53%, vascular 
disorders 52% and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 50%. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
by PT were anaemia 29%, fatigue 28%, arthralgia 26%, hypertension 24%, diarrhoea 23%, headache 
22%, nasopharyngitis and cyanosis 20% and nausea 18%.  
Thirty-one of the 66 CAD patients experienced at least 1 TEAE ≥Grade 3 in severity and 13 
experienced at least 1 TEAE of infection ≥Grade 3 in severity. Of the 66 patients, 25 experienced a 
total of 68 TESAEs, 4 patients experienced at least 1 TESAE assessed by the investigator as related to 
sutimlimab, and 10 patients experienced at least 1 TESAE of infection. In study BIVV009-03 Part A, 
one patient died from hepatic cancer which was assessed as not related to sutimlimab.  
Adverse events - placebo-controlled data 
Overall, in BIVV009-04 Part A, there were a greater number of TEAE reported in the sutimlimab group 
than in the placebo group (146 vs 90 events). The incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the 
sutimlimab group (n=22) than in the placebo group (n=20) 36% vs 20%, Grade≥3 TEAE 23% vs 15%, 
TESAEs 14% vs 5% and TEAEs within 24 hours of start of infusion 50% vs 35%. 
The most frequently TEAEs reported by SOC compared to placebo were gastrointestinal disorders 50% 
vs 35%, vascular disorders 41% vs 0%, general disorders and administration site conditions 41% vs 
35%, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 32% vs 20% and nervous system disorders 32% vs 
25%. Of these the imbalance in vascular disorders is the most striking finding with zero cases in the 
placebo group and almost half of the patients in the test group affected. The events were 
hypertension, Raynaud’s phenomenon and cyanosis. Consequently, hypertension, Raynaud’s 
phenomenon and cyanosis are included in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The most frequent adverse events by PT were headache, hypertension, Raynaud´s phenomenon, 
Rhinitis and cyanosis and this is also in line with what is presented in the SmPC (in 4.8) and is 
endorsed.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the total CAD treated population in BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04 (n=66), 68 TESAE were reported 
in 25 subjects. In BIVV009-03, one of the TESAEs (cerebral venous thrombosis) was assessed by the 
investigator as related to sutimlimab treatment. In BIVV009-04, two events (viral infection and 
hypertension) were assessed as related to the sutimlimab treatment.  
There are small numbers in each group and the TESAEs reported were generally of various nature and 
individual PTs were often reported in single patients with the exception of infections. Treatment-
emergent SAEs of infections were reported for 10 of the 76 (13.2%) patients, 5 of these being sepsis. 
Infections are expected to occur as a result of inhibition of the complement system.   
One fatal event was observed in study BIVV009-03 Part A, where a patient experienced a 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and was later diagnosed with hepatic cancer and withdrawn from the 
study. This event was deemed not related to sutimlimab. Another fatal event was observed in a BP 
patient that died due to cardiac failure and was deemed unlikely related to sutimlimab. The applicant 
has provided evidence that indicated that there is limited clinical and pre-clinical data to support a 
causal relationship between sutimlimab and malignancy and hence it is agreed that malignancy should 
currently not be added as a safety concern. In BIVV009-03 Part B, two patients died; one patient had a 
TESAE of Klebsiella pneumonia on day 946 and died on day 960 and another patient in BIVV009-03 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 117/135 
 
 
 
Part B with a complex medical history experienced a TESAE reported as “terminal aggravation of cold 
type haemolytic anaemia”. Neither of the fatal events in Part B were deemed as related to sutimlimab. 
Clinical chemistry 
There were increases in both direct and total bilirubin in BIVV009-03 (42% and 33%) and in both 
sutimlimab (41% and 50%) and placebo (55% and 15%) groups in BIVV009-04. It is agreed that 
abnormalities in total bilirubin are anticipated as a result of the extravascular and sometimes 
intravascular haemolytic process seen with CAD. High PCSA direct bilirubin values were either 
transient, isolated, or occurred in study participants with other high direct bilirubin values prior to 
study drug administration. One patient exposed to sutimlimab experienced a nonserious Grade 1 TEAE 
of increased ALT that was assessed as possibly related to study treatment. The abnormal ALT values 
did not meet the PCSA criteria for ALT.   
Overall, the PCSA chemistry values in patients with other CMDs were isolated or transient or consistent 
with the underlying disease indication (i.e., elevated bilirubin in patients with warm antibody hemolytic 
anemia [WAIHA] with haemolysis or elevated creatinine in patients with renal allografts). 
Haematology 
For some CAD patients, haemoglobin and haematocrit values beyond normal were observed across all 
studies and in both treatment groups in study BIVV009-04. Patients needed to have haemoglobin ≤10 
g/dL at screening to qualify for the study and it is anticipated that the level would vary with disease 
fluctuations. Although there was an increase in haemoglobin in most patients as a treatment effect 
there was variability in response and certain non-responders recorded (see efficacy part).  
Further, low values for leukocytes were observed in BIVV009-03 (25%) and BIVV009-04 in the 
sutimlimab group (14%) with no observed cases in the placebo group (10%). For neutrophil counts, 
low values were observed in BIVV009-03 (29%) and BIVV009-04 (14%), compared to in the placebo-
group (26%). In BIVV009-04, the Applicant reports that low neutrophil values were observed from 
week 1 to 21, after which the values increased to a range similar to the screening values. The 
applicant has provided clarifications on the fluctuations on laboratory values over time and it is agreed 
that there was no obvious trend in patients that experienced low leukocyte and/or low neutrophils.   
SLE 
Due to the mechanism of action of sutimlimab and the increased incidence of SLE in patients with 
congenital deficiencies of components of the classical complement pathway, standard clinical 
biomarkers related to SLE (eg, double-stranded DNA) and other autoimmune disorders were 
incorporated into the study design of all studies in the sutimlimab clinical development program. 
In CAD patients, 28 of 76 had all negative results or had all missing results prior to sutimlimab 
exposure and 48 of 76 had at least 1 positive SLE panel parameter result prior to sutimlimab exposure. 
Eight out of 76 patients were positive for any post-baseline assessment of SLE parameter and seven 
were positive for at least 1 SLE panel parameter at the last postbaseline evaluation.  
In BIV009-04 Part A, prior to receiving the study drug, 13 patients in the sutimlimab group and 16 
patients in the placebo group had ≥1 positive value for an SLE parameter and 9 patients in sutimlimab 
group and 4 patients in placebo group were negative or had missing values for all SLE panel 
parameters. In the patients who were negative or had all missing SLE panel assessments prior to 
receiving study drug, 3 of 9 (33%) patients in the sutimlimab group and 1 of 4 (25%) patients in the 
placebo group switched from negative or missing at baseline to positive for ≥1 SLE parameter at any 
post baseline assessment. Furthermore, two of the 4 patients exposed to placebo in Part A and then 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 118/135 
 
 
 
 
sutimlimab in Part B were negative in all SLE panel parameters prior to exposure had at least 1 
positive SLE panel parameter result at any time postbaseline and 1 was positive at the last 
postbaseline evaluation.  
Although there were some observed positive SLE panel parameter, the values seem to be variable over 
time and without any obvious pattern. In addition, none of the patients that shifted from negative at 
baseline to positive post baseline for the SLE parameter panel, developed SLE.  
Development of SLE is concluded as an `important potential risk´ in the RMP by the applicant, which is 
endorsed. A warning is also included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity  
In CAD patients, from the clinical safety summary, the Applicant stated that one patient with primary 
CAD in BIVV009-01 had an ADA positive result. This patient had multiple nonserious TEAEs reported 
which were assessed by the Investigator as unlikely related to study drug and resolved prior to the 
ADA positive test result. Two patients in BIVV009-03 and 6 patients in BIVV009-04 developed 
treatment-emergent ADAs.  
In other CMD patients, three patients with AMR had ADA positive test results. It is unclear if the cases 
were related to study drug or not. Overall, it appears that the presence of positive ADA tests did not 
affect the safety profile of sutimlimab, however the conclusions to be drawn are substantially limited 
by the low number of exposed subjects. The applicant has clarified and updated on the number of 
subjects that developed treatment emergent ADAs accordingly.  
Vital signs 
In CAD patients, potentially clinically significant increased blood pressure changes were reported in 12 
subjects and blood pressure decreased in 25 patients. Potentially clinically significant high/increased 
heart rates were reported for 22/76 patients and PCSA low/decreased heart rates were reported for 
28/76 patients. Two patients without previous history of hypertension experienced TEAE of increased 
blood pressure and one case was deemed related to study drug. A total of 16/76 patients reported 
TEAE of hypertension. 
Overall, it is agreed that there were no clinically significant trends in ECG finds in CAD patients, NHV 
nor other CMD patients exposed to sutimlimab. Any potential abnormality found during the physical 
examination was reported as an AE and hence the physical examination data were not formally 
analysed. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In CAD patients, a total of 22 of 23 (95.7%) patients <65 years old experienced at least 1 TEAE for a 
total of 370TEAEs. A total of 42 of 43 (92.2%) patients ≥65 years old experienced at least 1 TEAE for a 
total of 702 TEAE. Data are almost exclusively derived from elderly patients.  
Gender  
In CAD patients, 18 of 66 (27.3%) patients were male and 48 of 66 (72.7%) patients were female. 
Literature suggests a slightly higher prevalence of CAD in females. No clinically meaningful differences 
in the type of AEs were observed between gender subgroups for the integrated dataset of patients with 
CAD.  
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 119/135 
 
 
 
  
It is agreed that there is limited data available for the safety of sutimlimab in pregnant and/or lactating 
women. Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and to pass into human milk, 
however, there is no available data evidence in the literature suggesting that C1s inhibitors would have 
a potential of adversely impacting fertility and ability to get pregnant. The applicant has stated that 
onset of disease is normally after menopause in women (after the age of 55). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of sutimlimab during pregnancy. Sutimlimab should be given 
during pregnancy only if clearly indicated (SmPC section 4.6) 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In CAD patients, 6 of 76 patients discontinued treatment due to at least 1 TEAE/TESAE. The TEAEs for 
two patients regarding dysphagia/cyanosis and the infusion-related reaction were deemed as related to 
sutimlimab. These TEAEs are already listed as adverse reactions in the SmPC section 4.8 and this is 
considered sufficient.  
Another patient in BIVV009-03 Part B was withdrawn from the study due to TESAEs of cyanosis 
(acrocyanosis) and Klebsiella pneumonia on day 949. The patient received the last dose of study drug 
on day 946. Patient died from Klebsiella pneumonia on day 960. Both events were assessed as not 
related to sutimlimab by the Investigator. Overall, the pattern of AEs leading to discontinuations is not 
unexpected. 
Overall, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion due to small numbers of patients in each 
age/gender/race group. On the other hand, no alarming safety related findings were found in either of 
these subgroups. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Thromboembolic events  
In CAD patients, thromboembolic events, 5 (7.6%) patients experienced a total of 5 TEAEs of a 
thromboembolic event which included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (n=1), device-related 
thrombosis (n=1), peripheral artery thrombosis (n=1), transient ischemic attack (n=1), and deep vein 
thrombosis (n=1). In BIVV009-03 Part B, one patient had reported a serious thromboembolic event of 
peripheral artery thrombosis and one patient had a nonserious thromboembolic event of device-related 
thrombosis. Both events were assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to sutimlimab. In BIVV009-
04, three patients experienced treatment-emergent thromboembolic events (cerebral venous 
thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis and transient ischemic attack). The event of cerebral venous 
thrombosis was assessed as related to treatment. 
In general, CAD patients experience an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Due to low numbers 
in the available dataset, it is difficult to draw any conclusion on the thromboembolic events observed. 
However, one of the patients in BIVV009-04 experienced a serious thromboembolic event of cerebral 
venous thrombosis that was deemed related to sutimlimab.  
In BIVV009-04 there were 4 cases of thromboembolic events reported in sutimlimab group and none in 
the placebo group.  
In BIVV009-03, 1 patient experienced 1 thromboembolic event in part B. No patients experienced a 
treatment-emergent thromboembolic event during Part A. The applicant has sufficiently described the 
patients suffering from thromboembolic events and routine pharmacovigilance activities are deemed 
sufficient including findings in studies and hence, these events should be presented in PSURs.  
In other CMD patients, no thromboembolic events were observed. Despite the fact that patients with 
ITP have an increased risk of these events. However, the conclusions that can be drawn are limited by 
the low number of subjects with other CMD exposed to sutimlimab.   
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 120/135 
 
 
 
The Applicant has agreed to follow thromboembolic events in routine pharmacovigilance activities 
including findings in studies and presented in PSURs and this is deemed acceptable. 
TEAEs with onset within 24 hours of infusion 
In CAD patients, 35 of 66 (53.0%) patients with CAD experienced a total of 61 TEAEs within 24 hours 
of infusion. The most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred within 24 hours of the start of infusion 
of sutimlimab by PT were infusion-related reaction 6%, and hypertension and nausea 3%.  
The most common TEAEs by SOC that occurred within 24 hours were general disorders and 
administration site conditions, gastrointestinal disorders injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, vascular disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and nervous system 
disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and infections and infestations.  
A total of 23 patients with CAD were exposed to at least 1 undiluted infusion of sutimlimab in study 
BIVV009-04 Part B and 43.5 % experienced at least 1 TEAE for a total of 24 TEAEs within 24 hours of 
infusion. None of these patients discontinued from the study. The applicant has satisfactorily clarified 
what undiluted infusions means (i.e., the drug was not diluted in saline, resulting in a reduced volume 
of infusion solution).   
TEAEs of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis  
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are a well-recognised risk of monoclonal antibody therapies. In 
CAD patients, TEAEs that were suggestive of potential hypersensitivity reactions associated with 
sutimlimab included infusion-related reactions (5%) and pruritus and flushing (1%). One event 
suggestive of serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis associated with sutimlimab was 
identified in the small available dataset. A warning regarding hypersensitivity has been added by the 
applicant in section 4.4 in the SmPC and is deemed appropriate. Hypersensitivity is also listed as an 
‘important potential risk’ in the safety specification of the RMP which is endorsed. 
Treatment emergent infections 
Based on the functions of the classical complement pathway and evidence from subjects with 
congenital classical complement deficiencies, or treated with complement inhibitors, potential risks 
with sutimlimab administration include the development of infections, including those with 
encapsulated bacteria.  
In CAD patients, 74% experienced at least one TEAE of infections across all studies. TEAEs reported by 
more than 2 patients included: nasopharyngitis 20%, upper respiratory tract infection 15%, urinary 
tract infection 11%, cystitis, gastroenteritis, rhinitis (11%), Escherichia urinary tract infection 6%, oral 
herpes, respiratory tract infection, tooth infection, urinary tract infection bacterial 5%, diverticulitis, 
eye infection, Herpes zoster, influenza, otitis externa, pneumonia, sinusitis, skin candida, viral infection 
3%. Treatment-emergent SAEs of infections were reported for 13 of the 66 (19.7%) patients. Serious 
infections with encapsulated bacteria were reported, including 1 TESAE of pneumococcal sepsis caused 
by an encapsulated protocol-defined vaccine-targeted organism.  
The applicant has provided literature evidence that the risk of meningococcal infection with a selective 
C1s inhibitor such as sutimlimab is expected to be lower compared to terminal inhibitors (mainly C5b-
C8 components). A causal link between the serious infections recorded in the present studies and 
sutimlimab cannot be excluded. The Applicant has agreed to include serious infections as an ‘important 
identified risk’ which is endorsed.   
It is noted that 5 of the 10 TEASAE observed regarding infections were sepsis (Escherichia Sepsis, 
Pneumococcal Sepsis, Pulmonary Sepsis, Streptococcal Sepsis and Urosepsis). The Applicant has 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 121/135 
 
 
 
amended section 4.4 of the SmPC which now includes a statement regarding sepsis. Meningococcal 
infections is listed as `important potential risk´ which is endorsed.  
In both BIVV009-03 and BIVV009-04, specific therapies to reduce antibody production, such as 
rituximab and rituximab combination therapies, were prohibited. Thus, there is no safety data available 
to support such treatment concomitantly with sutimlimab and potentially treated individuals will be at 
risk for a weakened defence against infections. The Applicant has sufficiently clarified the information 
regarding the patients that received prohibited medications during the studies and the SmPC currently 
includes a statement in 5.1 referring to rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents; this is 
currently deemed appropriate.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials <and post-marketing> 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of sutimlimab in the target indication is considered acceptably characterised by the 
submitted safety data from the 6 studies, in particularly by the data from studies BIVV009-03 and 
BIVV009-04. However, some concerns need to be followed post-marketing such as serious infections, 
SLE and infections. In conclusion, overall, the safety profile of sutimlimab appears similar in the 
different sub-populations CAD, NHV and other CMD patients.

Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Enjaymo (sutimlimab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and 
authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
4.  Benefit risk assessment 
1.  Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
Enjaymo (sutimlimab) is proposed for treatment of haemolytic anaemia in adult patients with cold 
agglutinin disease (CAD). 
Primary CAD is a rare disease caused by autoantibodies (“cold agglutinins”) that bind to RBCs at 
temperatures below normal core body temperature, leading to agglutination of the RBCs causing cold-
related symptoms of ischaemia and/or complement activation through the classical pathway (CP) with 
subsequent haemolysis. Chronic extravascular haemolysis is the hallmark of CAD and could be 
associated with symptoms of anaemia such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, chest pain, as well as 
thromboembolic events.  
The aim of sutimlimab is to inhibit the CP activation through inhibition of C1s and thereby avoid 
haemolysis and subsequent anaemia. As opposed to secondary cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS), 
primary CAD is not related to underlying malignancy or infectious disease although an indolent 
lymphoproliferative disorder could be found. The mean age at presentation is mid to late 60s. 
The recommended dosage is 6,500 mg for patients weighing 39-<75 kg and 7,500 mg for patients 
weighing ≥75 kg, intravenously (IV) weekly for the first two weeks, with administration every two 
weeks thereafter. 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current standard of care in primary CAD includes supportive measures such as RBC transfusions and 
avoidance of cold exposure. In patients with more severe disease, antibody-reducing therapy is often 
recommended; however, no such therapy is currently approved for primary CAD. 
Approximately 90% of patients have anaemia with median Hb at 9.5 g/dL, a similar proportion have 
elevated markers of haemolysis and approximately 50% of patients have cold-induced symptoms such 
as acrocyanosis. Less than 50% warrant transfusion. Thus, some patients are asymptomatic and some 
experience symptoms only in relation to e.g., cold exposure or in relation to infectious disease, surgery 
or trauma. Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients have chronic or frequent episodes of 
considerable haemolytic anaemia for which there is currently no approved treatment.

Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety in the intended target population relies on two phase III 
studies. Study BIVV009-04 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study with a 
duration of 26 weeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in 42 patients (n=22 on 
sutimlimab and n=20 on placebo) with primary CAD without a recent history of blood transfusion 
(within 6 months). Key eligibility criteria were a baseline Hb ≤10 g/dL, active haemolysis with a 
bilirubin level above the normal reference range, presence of at least one CAD-related sign or 
symptom, exclusion of patients with a history of blood transfusion within 6 months of screening, or 
history of more than one blood transfusion within 12 months of screening. Secondary Cold agglutinin 
Syndrome (CAS) was excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint, defined as 
the responder rate, where patients meeting all 3 of the following criteria: 1) Hb level increased ≥1.5 
g/dL from baseline at treatment assessment endpoint AND 2) The patient did not receive a blood 
transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26, AND 3) The patient did not receive treatment for CAD 
beyond what was permitted per protocol from Week 5 through Week 26. Important secondary 
endpoints included change of Hb levels, haemolysis markers (total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH)) and quality of life (QoL) evaluations. 
By design, this study is considered to provide the more robust data.  
Study BIVV009-03 is a phase 3, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre study with a duration of 26 
weeks to assess the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in 24 patients with primary CAD who had a 
recent history of blood transfusion. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally in line with those 
of the CADENZA trial, though with the exception that patients with a transfusion history of ≥1 blood 
transfusions within 6 months of enrolment were included. The primary composite endpoint and the 
secondary endpoints were also generally similar to those selected in BIVV009-04, but the primary 
composite endpoint needed a higher increase in Hb (i.e. ≥12 g/dL at TAT or an increase of >2 g/dL 
from baseline to end of treatment) as compared to the increase of Hb (>1.5 g/dL) in BIVV009-04. 
For both study BIVV009-04 and BIVV009-03, extension parts interim and final results have been 
provided.  
2.  Favourable effects 
BIVV009-04 (CADENZA) 
The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as patients who had a ≥1.5 g/dL increase in 
Hgb levels at the treatment assessment endpoint (TAT; defined as the mean value of Weeks 23, 25, 
and 26), did not receive a blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 and did not receive 
treatment for CAD beyond what is permitted per protocol. There were 16/22 or 72.7% (95% CI 49.8-
89.3) and 3/20 or 15% (95% CI 3.2-37.9) responders in the sutimlimab and placebo group, 
respectively. 
The difference was statistically significant (odds ratio of 15.94 (95% CI: 2.88 to 88.04; p<0.001)). 
The outcome of the sensitivity analyses was consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint. Sutimlimab 
treatment effects were similar across the investigated small subgroups of age, gender, baseline Hb and 
previous use of rituximab. 
Key secondary endpoints were: 
- 
LS mean change from baseline in Hb at the TAT, which was 2.66 g/dL (95% CI: 2.09 to 3.22) 
and 0.09 g/dL (95% CI: -0.50 to 0.68) for sutimlimab and placebo, respectively with an LS 
mean difference of 2.56 g/dL (p<0.001; 95% CI: 1.75 to 3.38). 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 128/135 
 
 
 
- 
LS mean change from baseline in QoL, as assessed by the change in FACIT-Fatigue scale 
scores at the TAT, with an increase of 10.83 points (95% CI: 7.45 to 14.22) in the sutimlimab 
group and 1.91 points (95% CI: -1.65 to 5.46) in the placebo group with a statistically 
significant LS mean difference of +8.93 points (p<0.001; 95% CI: 4.0 to 13.9). 
Additional secondary endpoints of importance include change in markers of haemolysis at the TAT. For 
bilirubin, there was a mean decrease of 22.129 (SD 10.468) μmol/L in the sutimlimab group and 1.829 
(SD 13.894) μmol/L in the placebo group. For LDH, there was a mean decrease of 150.833 U/L (SD 
160.824) in the sutimlimab group and a mean increase of 7.600 U/L (SD 212.690) in the placebo 
group. 
BIVV009-03 (CARDINAL) 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders defined as patients who did not receive a blood 
transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26, did not receive treatment for CAD beyond what is 
permitted per protocol and had a ≥2 g/dL increase from baseline in Hb levels or increases Hb to ≥12 
g/dL at the treatment assessment endpoint (TAT; defined as the mean value of Weeks 23, 25, and 
26). These criteria were fulfilled in 13/24 (54%) of subjects. 
Secondary endpoints were: 
-  Change from baseline in bilirubin at the TAT, which in mean decreased by 38 μmol/L. 
-  Change from baseline in QoL, assessed by change in FACIT-Fatigue scale scores at the TAT, 
which in mean increased by 10.85 
-  Change from baseline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the TAT, which in mean decreased by 
126.95 U/L. 
-  Number of transfusions after the first 5 weeks of study drug administration, which were in 
mean 0.9. 
-  Change from baseline in Hb at the TAT, which was 2.6 g/dL. 
Effects of sutimlimab treatment on the secondary endpoints in study BIVV009-03 were generally 
similar to those observed in study BIVV009-04. 
Sustainability of efficacy 
At the end of the extension periods, the patients, who switched in study BIVV009-04 from placebo in 
Part A to open-label sutimlimab in Part B, showed the same response on Hb, bilirubin and FACIT-
Fatigue score as seen in the sutimlimab-treated patients upon initiation of Part A. The effect on Hb, 
haemolytic parameters and FACIT-Fatigue score appear mostly retained. The long-term data in 
BIVV009-03 demonstrated generally similar data as observed in the long-term BIVV009-04 trial. 
3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the rareness of the condition the number of subjects included in clinical trials is limited but 
more than 90 % of subjects remained in the studies for more than 52 weeks. The effect diminished 
shortly following treatment discontinuation making episodic treatment less appropriate. 
The use of CAD specific treatment such as antibody-reducing therapy, is unclear for both phase 3 
studies and there is thus no data available supporting concomitant treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/863061/2022  
Page 129/135 
 
 
 
 
4.  Unfavourable effects 
A majority of CAD patients (64 of 66) experienced at least one adverse event among which at least 36 
had TEAEs deemed related to sutimlimab. The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were infections 
and infestations 74%, gastrointestinal disorders 68%, general disorders and administration site 
conditions 64%, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 53%, vascular disorders 52% and 
skin, subcutaneous tissue disorders 50%, blood and lymphatic system disorders 49% and nervous 
system disorders 47%. Placebo controlled data (study BIVV009-04) showed an imbalance for certain 
SOCs with more adverse events recorded for gastrointestinal disorders (50 vs 35 %), vascular 
disorders (41 vs 0%), subcutaneous tissue disorders (32 vs 20%) and nervous system disorders (32 vs 
25%). Most cases of vascular disorders were hypertension, Raynaud’s phenomenon and cyanosis. Of 
the serious events most cases represented single events, but treatment-emergent serious infections 
were reported for 10 of the 76 (13.2%) patients, 5 or these being cases of sepsis. In this context it 
should be mentioned that certain patients experienced low values for leukocytes in the studies. Five  
patients experienced thromboembolic events of which one was deemed related to treatment. Of the 
four  fatal cases none was deemed related to treatment.  
5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitations relating to the safety data is the small number of patients treated with sutimlimab 
and only one of the studies conducted in CAD-patients was placebo controlled. Only 43 patients were 
exposed to sutimlimab >55 weeks and 18 patients >145 weeks in the CAD-population. There are some 
safety concerns regarding serious infections (including sepsis), development of SLE and 
hypersensitivity reactions for Enjaymo. However, these are all listed in the safety specifications in the 
RMP and hence are being followed up on. In addition, thromboembolic events will be monitored during 
routine pharmacovigilance activities including findings in studies and will be presented in PSURs. 
Furthermore, additional pharmacovigilance activities have been required which include a long-term 
post-approval safety and effectiveness drug cohort study (CAD real word evidence registry – Cadence) 
and a survey of healthcare professionals in Europe (see RMP).

7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Sutimlimab is claimed to be the first-in-class, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits 
specifically the classical CP and is expected to result in inhibition of haemolysis in patients with primary 
CAD, while other complement pathways remained functionally intact. In line with its mechanism of 
action, the initially proposed indication of sutimlimab is, therefore, the treatment of haemolytic 
anaemia in adult primary CAD patients.  
The current application is mainly based on the results of two phase 3 studies, controlled study 
BIVV009-04/CADENZA and uncontrolled single-arm study BIVV009-03/CARDINAL in patients with 
primary CAD. The CAD patients included in both studies had anaemia, haemolysis and one or more 
CAD-related sign and/or symptom which could be an anaemia-related symptom or another CAD-
related symptom. Study BIVV009-04 aimed at a population free from RBC transfusions as opposed to 
study BIVV009-03; together, they are considered to be representative of a primary CAD population 
with haemolytic anaemia. The studies were in general well-conducted, and the choice to select placebo 
as comparator for the controlled study is considered acceptable, as currently no approved treatments 
for CAD are available. 
The primary endpoints in both phase 3 studies are considered to support that sutimlimab provides an 
increase in Hb of clear clinical relevance in a symptomatic CAD population with moderate to severe 
anaemia at baseline. These results are supported by the secondary efficacy endpoints from both 
studies, with an increase in Hb levels, a clear and rapid decrease in markers of haemolysis and an 
increase in QoL measures. Despite the limited number of study participants, the clinical data are 
considered comprehensive enough to support that efficacy is considered adequately shown, in the 
target population i.e., patients with haemolytic anaemia. 
The adverse events of concern are infections as serious infections (including exacerbations of infections 
with incapsulated bacteria is known to be linked to complement system inhibition) and vascular 
disorders where a clear unbalance was shown in placebo-controlled data. Overall, based on the 
currently available data, the safety pattern appears acceptable and sutimlimab appears to be generally 
well tolerated over time in line with the earlier assessed interim data. The proposed target population 
is broader than the studied populations with respect to severity of haemolysis and in that only 
symptomatic, primary CAD patients were included. This is acceptable.

Balance of benefits and risks 
In terms of benefit, sutimlimab provides a relevant beneficial treatment effect on auto-immune 
haemolytic anaemia as measured by an increase in Hb level in the absence of blood transfusions or 
other medicinal treatment, as compared to placebo. This was accompanied by improvement in 
haemolysis markers and QoL. The use of sutimlimab appeared to be well tolerated with an acceptable 
safety profile and without major safety signals.  
Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The Applicant is applying for a full marketing authorisation. The provided efficacy data (derived from 
one placebo-controlled study, one single arm trial) is considered as comprehensive. The safety data is 
considered as rather limited, but acceptable considering the rareness of the disease. A full marketing 
authorisation is acceptable.  
8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Enjaymo is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
5.  Recommendations

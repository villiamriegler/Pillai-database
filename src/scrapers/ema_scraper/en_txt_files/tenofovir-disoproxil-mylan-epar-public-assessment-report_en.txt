1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant MYLAN S.A.S. submitted on 29 July 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, through the centralised procedure under 
Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004– ‘Generic of a Centrally authorised product’. 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
refers to a reference product for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the basis 
of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication. 
HIV-1 infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. 
In adults, the demonstration of the benefit of Tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one 
study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in 
which Tenofovir disoproxil was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral 
pre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of patients 
having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years. 
The choice of Tenofovir disoproxil to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
Hepatitis B infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults 
with: 
•  compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis (see section 5.1). 
•  evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
•  decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in 
adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age with: 
•  compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, persistently 
elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis (see sections 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The generic medicinal products serve public health need and the applicant developed one version of generic 
medicinal product against reference medicinal product Viread (MAH Gilead Sciences International Limited). 
Viread was authorised in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier is as film-coated tablet containing 245 mg 
of Tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir disoproxil maleate Mylan is identical in terms of qualitative and quantitative 
composition of the active substances (Tenofovir disoproxil) and is therefore expected to perform identically in 
vivo within the clinical setting. 
The application for Tenofovir disoproxil maleate Mylan 245 mg film-coated tablets was submitted by Mylan SAS, 
France via the centralised procedure as Generic of a Centrally Authorised Medicinal Product of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 and according Article 10(1) generic application of Directive 2001/83/EC. The chosen reference 
medicinal product authorised in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier is Viread (MAH Gilead Sciences 
International Limited, UK) film-coated tablet containing 245 mg of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Marketing 
authorisation number: EU/1/01/200/001-002. Date of authorisation 05-02-2002.  
The Applicant seek Centralised marketing authorisation (MA) approval for Tenofovir disoproxil maleate Mylan for 
the treatment of HIV-infected adults of 18 years of age and older and for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in 
adults 
Quality data showed that both medicinal products are based on same active moieties and are composed by 
different salts in case of tenofovir (maleate in case of applied product vs fumarate in case of reference product). 
Based on the data provided, there is no need to generate additional data. A number of quality issues related to 
the active substance have been clarified and the drug product manufacturer’s active substances specifications 
are considered acceptable. 
Non-clinical data presented (i) original studies (repeat dose toxicity study, genotoxicity screen and a single 
species general toxicity study in support of the Tenofovir disoproxil dimer, mixed dimer, and mono POC dimer 
impurities) as well as (ii) overviews on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology overview were provided. 
These data justified the no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. 
A clinical dataset consisted of two parts – clinical overview (bibliographic data on clinical pharmacology, efficacy 
and safety of tenofovir) and the comparative bioequivalence study in fed condition. These data could justify why 
Assessment report

there is no need to generate additional clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety data. The 
positive benefit risk assessment can be concluded. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as maleate) as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, colloidal 
anhydrous silica and magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin and Indigo Carmine 
Aluminium Lake (E132). 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) child resistant 
closures with wads containing aluminium induction sealing liner and silica gel desiccant as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil (as maleate) is bis({[propan-2-yloxy)carbonyl]oxy}methyl) 
({[2R)-1-(6-amino-9Hpurin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]oxy}methyl)phosphonate(2Z)-but-2-enedioate, corresponding 
to the molecular formula C19H30N5O10P∙C4H4O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 635.51 g/mol and the 
following structure (Figure 1): 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016 
Page 10/38 
 
  
  
 
Figure 1.  Structure of tenofovir disoproxil maleate 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRD. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, freely soluble in DMF 
and soluble in aqueous solutions (pH 1.2-8.0) and methanol. Its pKa is 3.5 and its partition coefficient is 0.67.   
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre at C-11 (the C-2 
position of the propyl side-chain). Two isomers are possible due to this asymmetric carbon. The R-isomer is 
commercially produced. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical rotation. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate exhibits polymorphism and different forms are reported in the literature (form I and 
form II). The PXRD method distinguishes the polymorphic forms and PXRD data confirmed that Form I is 
consistently produced and that it is stable upon storage. Three tenofovir disoproxil maleate batches were 
undergone compaction followed by milling. The milled tenofovir disoproxil maleate batches were analysed by 
PXRD. The XRD pattern comparison demonstrated that compaction followed by milling operations does not 
affect polymorphism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance was provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate is synthesized in three main steps (Stages I, II and III) using commercially 
available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Two manufacturing sites carry out 
stages I and II. Stage III only takes place at the second site. The synthesis was described in sufficient detail. 
The synthetic process encompasses the stereoselective formation of the desired tenofovir disoproxil maleate 
R-enantiomer from a commercially available optically active starting material.  The process has been shown able 
to consistently produce tenofovir disoproxil maleate that meets the required quality standards. 
The critical process parameters have been presented and adequate in-process controls are applied during the 
synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the relevant EU guidance. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packed  in  double  polyethylene  bags  which  are  in  turn  packed  in  triple  laminated 
aluminium packs, heat sealed, and placed in HDPE containers which comply with the Ph. Eur. and relevant EC 
regulations 2015/174. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), solubility (visual), identification (IR, 
HPLC), clarity of solution (visual), water content (KF), sulfated ash (in house), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), S-isomer 
content (chiral HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), chloromethyl isopropyl 
carbonate (GC), 9-propenyl adenine (LC-MS), impurities (sum of diethyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate and tosyl 
Assessment report

Page 11/38 
 
  
  
phosphonate) (LC-MS), formaldehyde content (UPLC), total genotoxic impurities (LC-MS, UPLC) and particle 
size (laser diffraction particle). 
Skip testing for 9-propenyl adenine, limit of impurities (sum of diethyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate and tosyl 
phosponate), formaldehyde and total genotoxic impurities in the active substance specification has been 
adequately justified as they are consistently below 30% of the TTC as per ICH M7 option 1.  
Omission of tests for polymorphism and microbiological quality in the active substance specification has been 
justified. Regarding polymorphism, it was demonstrated the same polymorphic form was consistently produced 
in the process and was stable upon storage. The absence of microbiological control was also considered 
acceptable as tenofovir disoproxil maleate is recrystallised from isopropyl alcohol which does not allow microbial 
growth, which was confirmed by testing representative production scale batches for microbiological quality. 
All the proposed specification limits are considered justified and in line with the relevant ICH guidelines. The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated 
in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three consecutive production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Stability studies under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) were conducted.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, HPLC), water content (KF), S-isomer 
content (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
A significant increase in impurities was observed under accelerated conditions and the batches did not meet the 
specifications. Therefore, additional stability studies were conducted under intermediate conditions. Under 
these conditions, a slight increase in the level of the monoester impurity was observed but no other degradation 
was noted. All other measured parameters remained well within their specification limits. 
Results from forced degradation studies were also provided. Tenofovir disoproxil maleate was exposed to 
aqueous acid, aqueous base, oxidant, heat and UV. Solid samples were exposed to white fluorescent light 
(according to ICH Q1B), UV at 365 nm and heat at 60 ºC. 
Significant degradation of tenofovir disoproxil maleate was observed in solution under alkaline, acid and 
oxidative conditions and when exposed to heat or UV light. No significant degradation was observed in solid 
state when samples were exposed to heat or white fluorescent light but slight degradation was observed on 
exposure to UV light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months in the proposed container and the 
storage precaution “store below 25 ºC.”

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Mylan finished product is a round, bioconvex light blue film coated tablet. The aim of 
development was to produce an immediate release solid dosage form bioequivalent with the reference product, 
Viread. The excipients chosen are the same as those in the reference product except that pregelatinised starch 
and croscarmellose sodium are substituted with low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose as disintegrant and 
colloidal anhydrous silica as a glidant. 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Mylan uses a different salt of the active substance (maleate rather than fumarate). The 
active substance exhibits pH-independent solubility across the physiological pH range and is a BCS class III 
compound. It is non-hygroscopic with poor flow properties but susceptible to hydrolysis and thus, a dry 
granulation method was selected. Compatibility with excipients was investigated with binary mixtures and some 
degradation was seen on storage. However, similar degradation was seen with the control active substance 
study and the long term stability studies show the chosen formulation to afford adequate stability. Levels of 
excipients and manufacturing parameters were selected based on the dissolution performance of the resultant 
tablets, as well as flow properties of powders and manufacturability aspects. 
Dissolution profiles of the biobatch, manufactured on pilot scale, and a second production scale batch of 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Mylan were compared with Viread over the physiological pH range. All tablets dissolved 
(>85%) within 15 minutes in all cases and profiles can thus be considered as similar. 
Since the finished product is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and aqueous solubility is not linked to pH, 
an acidic pH medium was selected for dissolution testing. Other parameters were optimised to ensure sink 
conditions whilst maintaining discriminatory power. Batches manufactured with too little disintegrant or tablets 
which had been over-compressed or over-lubricated dissolved much slower than tablets manufactured using the 
commercial process and formula, thus demonstrating the discriminatory nature of the method. 
In section 4.2 of the SmPC, it is stated that in exceptional circumstances for patients with difficulty swallowing, 
the finished product can be administered following disintegration of the tablet in 100 ml of water, orange juice, 
or grape juice. Data was provided showing comparative disintegration times of Tenofovir Disoproxil and Viread 
in water and demonstrating that disintegration occurs for both products within 6 minutes. Since tenofovir 
disoproxil maleate (BCS III) is highly soluble in water, it was considered that a clinical study to investigate 
relative bioequivalence was not necessary as membrane permeability rather than dissolution is likely to be the 
rate limiting step for absorption. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with PP child resistant closure with a wad containing aluminium 
induction sealing liner and silica gel desiccant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  mixing  of  intra-granular  materials  followed  by 
compaction;  milling  and  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients;  compression  to  form  tablets;  film  coating; 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on the lowest proposed 
production scale (200,000 tablets). Validation will be carried out as per the presented protocol on the proposed 
625,000  and  1,400,000  tablet  scales  before  commercialisation.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls are used to control critical steps in the process (uniformity of powder blend, core tablet 
properties,  coating  of  tablets,  and  integrity  of  primary  packaging).  They  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  including 
appearance, identity (HPLC and TLC), colour identification (colour test and UV), dissolution (UV), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided from four batches produced on the smallest of the proposed commercial 
scales confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from four batches of finished product manufactured on the smallest of the proposed commercial 
scales batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up 
to  12  months  under  intermediate  conditions  (30  ºC  /  65%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches of Tenofovir 
Disoproxil  Mylan  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay, impurities, water content and microbiological quality. 
The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  There  were  no  significant  trends  in  dissolution  and 
microbiological  quality  under  any  conditions.  Water  content  remained  fairly  steady  under  accelerated  and 
intermediate conditions but dropped under long term conditions. Impurities increased and assay decreased over 
time under all conditions with more degradation at higher temperatures and humidities. Assay results were out 
of specification in 3 out of 4 batches under accelerated conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. No significant trends were observed and the finished product is not considered to be 
photosensitive.

An in-use stability study is also in progress. Bottles were opened every day for 2 minutes over a 30 day period. 
Completed studies used batches stored for 0 and 5 months before instigating the protocol. The study will be 
repeated on bottles stored for 23 and 35 months as per the Note for Guidance on In-use stability testing of 
human medicinal products (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months below 25 oC stored in the original package 
to protect from light and moisture as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. The magnesium stearate is 
of vegetal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant should repeat the in-use stability study on a batch towards the end of its shelf-life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical data consisted of literature overview and own studies. The non-clinical safety profile of Tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate has been studied in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys (Viread SBOA 
2001). Less non-clinical safety data is available for the maleate salt form. However, following oral 
administration, Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is rapidly absorbed and converted to Tenofovir. While the 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016 
Page 15/38 
 
  
  
pharmacological profile of Tenofovir disoproxil will be equivalent subsequent to administration of either salt, a 
brief scientific review and safety assessment was conducted to compare the potential toxicity profiles of the two 
salt forms. 
In addition, the Applicant evaluated and compared the toxicity profiles Tenofovir disoproxil maleate and 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in a 90-day oral repeated dose toxicity study in rats. Results from this study 
demonstrate the toxicity profile to be comparable for Tenofovir disoproxil maleate and fumarate, thus the 
maleate salt is considered to be equivalent and therefore not expected to alter the patient response. These data 
taken together, as summarized below, demonstrates that maleate exposure (55 mg/tablet; 0.9 mg/kg/day for 
a 60 kg individual) at the maximum recommended dose of 245 mg/day (Viread SPC 2015) in Applicant’s 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Maleate film coated tablets is safe for use and is not expected to alter the toxicological 
profile. 
Data for bibliographical overview has been obtained from literature searches of the internet as well as the US 
National Library of Medicine database (MEDLINE/TOXLINE) back to 1965. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (CAS# 
202138-50-9), Tenofovir disoproxil maleate, Tenofovir (CAS# 147127-20-6), and common synonyms for these 
were used in the conduction of these searches. These searches were completed June 1, 2015. 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan manufactured by MYLAN S.A.S. is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all Tenofovir disoproxil containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non clinical data for this application consisted of data from literature. There are some differences in the active 
substance entity in Reference product Viread. Viread contains Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, while Tenofovir 
disoproxil maleate is contained in the generic product. Based on literature data, the applicant stated that 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate will be rapidly absorbed and converted to Tenofovir as is established for Tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate. The applicant provided a GLP compliant 90-day oral repeated dose toxicity study in rats 
where toxicity profile Tenofovir disoproxil maleate and Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was evaluated. On the 
basis of the results, it can be said, that both the maleate and fumarate salt formulations of Tenofovir disoproxil 
were well tolerated at doses up to and including 300 mg/kg/day findings limited to slight salivation at 300 
mg/kg/day. Furthermore, the amount of maleate at the NOAEL delivered daily for 90 days is approximately 
53-fold the estimated maximum exposure (on a body surface area basis) to the maximum anticipated maleate 
exposure in Applicant’s Tenofovir disoproxil maleate film coated tablets. The CHMP considered this as 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016

Concerning ERA the Applicant state that Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg film-coated tablet correspond to the 
Reference product Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets as such impact to the environment is expected to be 
similar and not increased. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan and justifications that 
the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and 
efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the 
relevant guideline and therefore additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study TE-14-024 Title:  An open label, balanced, randomised, two treatment, two sequence, two period, 
cross-over, single dose comparative bioequivalence study of tenofovir disoproxil film-coated tablets 245 mg 
(test) of Mylan and Viread (tenofovir disoproxil) in healthy adults under fed conditions  
Methods 
Study design  
This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two treatment, two sequence, two period crossover, 
fed oral bioequivalence study to assess the single dose bioequivalence of Tenofovir disoproxil (as maleate 
[TDM]) film coated Tablets 245 mg with that of Viread® (Tenofovir disoproxil [as fumarate]) film coated tablets 
245 mg in 36 healthy adult male human subjects, under fed conditions. Also it was anticipated to monitor clinical 
status, adverse events and laboratory investigations and assess relative safety and tolerance of TDM film coated 
Tablets 245 mg under fed conditions 
Study consisted of two periods (Period I and Period II) separated by at least 10 days washout period. In the 
study, washout period lasted 12 days. After the washout period, in Period II, the subjects have been 
administered by the other drug that they have not been administered in the Period I. Subjects were housed in 
the clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to investigational product administration until after the 72 hours 
post dose in both the study periods. Blood samples were collected before dosing and up to 72 hours after each 
dosing period. 
The Applicant explained that the elimination half-life range was ~12 to 18 hours for tenofovir in literature. The 
last sampling time was evaluated as 5 times of t½ which was found as ~60 to 90 hours for tenofovir. The period 
of 72 hours sampling in this study was judged to be sufficient by the Applicant to characterise the 
concentration-time curve. 
The Applicant noted that the wash-out period was evaluated as 10 times of t½ which was found as ~120 to 180 
hours (5-7.5 days) for tenofovir. Therefore, the two treatment periods were separated by a wash-out period of 
at least 10 days between two periods to minimize the carry-over effect. 
The treatments (one tablet containing and 245 mg Tenofovir disoproxil (as Maleate) for test product and 245 mg 
Tenofovir disoproxil (as Fumarate) for reference product) were given to each subject by oral route with 240 mL 
of water, in the morning to overnight fasted subjects for at least 10 hours prior to start of high fat high calorie 
non-vegetarian breakfast approximately 800-1000 kilo calories till at least 4 hours post dose. Subjects were 
instructed to complete breakfast within 30 minutes. 
A total of 23 (6 ml) blood samples for PK analysis were collected during each period. Blood samples were drawn 
pre-dose (no earlier than 2 hours prior to dosing) and at 0.167,0.333,0.500,0.667,0.833, 1.000, 1.250, 1.500, 
1.750,2.000,2.500,3.000, 4.000, 5.000, 6.000, 8.000, 10.000, 12.000, 24.000, 36.000, 48.000 and 72.000 
hours post dose in K2 EDTA tubes. Blood samples were cooled in an ice bath or other chilling device .until 
centrifugation. Blood samples were centrifugated under refrigeration at 3S00rpm at 4°C for 10 min within 30 
minutes after the last blood sample collection of respective time point. Plasma was extracted, divided in 
duplicates (primary (l.5 mL) and secondary (rest of the volume) aliquots) and stored in in a freezer within 60 
minutes of blood sample collection at -70°C ± 20°C at the clinical facility until shipment to analytical facility 
(Mylan Laboratories Limited, India). The samples have been stored at -70°C ± 15°C at the analytical facility 
(Mylan Laboratories Limited, India) until analysed.

Blinding  
This was an open-labelled clinical study. But, bioanalytical analyst was blinded towards the treatments (Test or 
Reference) administered to subjects. 
Safety was evaluated through assessment of physical examination, vital signs and laboratory evaluation, 
physical examination and monitoring for adverse events throughout the course of the study. 
There was no change or deviation in the conduct of the study. None of the randomised subjects dropped out the 
study. The following protocol deviation was reported: PROC GLM procedure was used instead of PROC MIXED 
and Pharmacokinetic parameters were computed in SAS instead of WinNonlin. According the Applicant, this may 
not affect the outcome of the study. 
In conclusion, this was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two treatment, two sequence, two 
period crossover fed oral bioequivalence study. The basis of the bioequivalence study under fed conditions is 
justified and the study design is acceptable. The total caloric content of meal is acceptable (approximately 
800-1000 kcal), the description of composition of meal with regard to protein, carbohydrate and fat content is 
lacking. Randomization was conducted properly. This was an open-labelled clinical study. Bioanalytical analyst 
was blinded towards the treatments (Test or Reference) administered to subjects. The wash-out period was long 
enough. The sampling period was long enough, no pre-dose levels were detected. The AUC ratio was higher than 
80% in all subjects. The sampling scheme was adequate to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Tmax 
was not observed in any subject in the first sample time point. The scope of study does not interfere with 
statistical considerations and recommendations for bioequivalence trial. The design of study was based on the 
fact that the crossover increases the statistical test power. The design of study is considered as adequate for 
given conditions. Protocol deviations were minor and did not affect the overall outcome of the study.

Pharmacokinetic variables 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for Tenofovir were calculated using non-compartmental techniques. 
The maximum concentration (Cmax,) and the time at which it occurred relative to the administered dose (Tmax) 
was determined from the observed plasma concentration-time profile over the sampling time interval. The 
elimination rate constant (Kel) was determined by linear regression of the terminal linear phase of the log 
plasma concentration-time profile. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCt) was the sum of the 
Assessment report

linear trapezoidal estimation of the areas from the time of dosing to the time of the last quantifiable 
concentration. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as t1/2 = 0.693/Kel.  
Primary parameters (AUC0-t, Cmax), and secondary parameters (AUC0-∞, Tmax, AUCratio, Kel and t1/2) were 
calculated using WinNonlin® professional software (Version: 5.3 or higher; Pharsight Corporation, USA). 
Standards for bioequivalence: The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean (Geometric mean) AUC0-t and 
Cmax of the test to reference formulation for Ln-transformed data should be within 80% to 125% for Tenofovir 
to establish bioequivalence. 
Thus, the PK variables are adequate. Standard methods were used. 
Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise stated, analyses were performed on pharmacokinetic data of subjects using SAS® statistical 
software, and all hypothesis tests were conducted with alpha of 0.05 and beta 0.90. Data were summarized 
using adequate descriptive statistics. Majority of analyses used the parametric tests. 
Descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variance, median, maximum and minimum for all 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated. Consistent with Schuirmann’s two one-sided tests procedure for 
bioequivalence, ANOVA was performed on log-transformed data. Analysis of variance: log-transformed data of 
AUC0-∞, AUC0-t and Cmax was to be evaluated statistically using the PROC MIXED from SAS® for difference 
due to treatment, period and sequence as a fixed effects and subject within sequence as a random effect. The 
period, treatment and sequence effects were to be tested at 5% level of significance using the mean square 
error as the error. Non-parametric analysis of Tmax was also performed on untransformed data of Tenofovir 
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
The primary parameters were AUC0-t, Cmax, and secondary parameters were AUC0-∞, Tmax, AUC ratio, Kel 
and t½, calculated using WinNonlin® software. 
The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean (Geometric mean) AUC0-t and Cmax of the test to reference 
formulation for log-transformed data should be within 80% to 125% for Tenofovir to establish bioequivalence. 
The log-transformations were specified in the protocol and conducted properly as analyses. 
Determination of sample size 
Based on the literature and in-house studies data the highest intra-subject CV was found to be around 23%. 
Hence, considering the variability of 23% a minimum of 32 subjects are required to detect a clinically significant 
difference of 20% between the formulations at 5% level of significance with a power of 90% for a two way 
crossover design. In total, 36 subjects were planned and randomized for the study with additional 8 subjects 
screened only. There were no dropouts in this study. The recruitment of study sample was conducted based on 
pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The required sample size was calculated.

periods; (2) analytical error, as the plasma samples of each subject of both the periods are analysed all together 
and in a sequence in which the blood samples were collected; (3) period effect, as in each period both the 
products were dosed (Test and Reference). The Applicant stated that “It can simply be ignored because the 
decision of equivalence is based on the 90% confidence interval is within the equivalence boundaries.”  
The Applicant concluded that for the log transformed data, the 90% confidence intervals about the ratio of the 
Test geometric mean to Reference geometric mean are within the 80% to 125% limits for AUC0-t and Cmax. 
Based on these results, Tenofovir disoproxil Maleate film coated Tablets 245 mg of Mylan Laboratories Limited, 
India and Viread (Tenofovir disoproxil) film coated Tablets 245 mg of Gilead Sciences Intl Ltd, Cambridge CB21 
6GT, Verenigd Koninkrijk, Royaume-Uni, Vereinigtes Konigreich, are bioequivalent under fed conditions.  
Thus, the AUC ratio is above 80% for all subjects and treatments. No subject had detectable pre-dose plasma 
levels and no subject reached Cmax at the first sampling time point. The test to reference ratio of geometric 
means and the corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax and AUC0-t were all within the acceptance 
range of 80.00 to 125.00%. The bioequivalence has been shown appropriately under fed conditions. 
Safety data 
Neither death nor serious adverse event occurred during the study. Total 3 adverse events occurred in study, 
out of them 2 adverse events were moderate and 1 adverse events was mild in nature: 
For Test Product: Subject 24 had musculoskeletal pain in Period I. 500 mg paracetamol tablet was given to this 
subject. For Reference Product: Subject 26 had myalgia in Period I. Subject 28 had pain in extremity in Period 
I. 
The Applicant explained that the adverse events that occurred in the study are possibly related to the study 
product. These adverse events considered as the most common adverse events mentioned in the literatures.  All 
physical examinations and all laboratory parameters were considered as normal by the investigator. Blood 
pressures, heart rate and ECG results were judged as normal (except Subject 01, 02, 03, 05, 16, 19, 25, 28, 30 
and 36 for pre-study, Subject 02, 03, 06, 07, 08, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25, 28, 32, 33 and 36 for 
post-study for only ECG) by the investigator. The Applicant summarised that overall tolerability of the products 
found to be good. It is agreed that the medicines were generally safe and well tolerated by the subjects in the 
study. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is considered bioequivalent with Viread.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided and is adequate. To 
support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study. Statement of GCP compliance 
and compliance with applicable principles of GLP is provided.  
Upon review of the study results a number of issues were raised (uncertainties in data management, including 
peri-database lock procedures, misreported “normal values”, questionable “null” values at the end of sampling 
periods, statistical analyses pre-specifications, account for possible dropouts, back-transformation, uncertain 
precision in data calculation and missing information on the database lock). All these issues were clarified and 
the CHMP considered the responses acceptable. In addition, an EU GCP inspection has been conducted and 
concluded that the clinical trial data was acceptable and could be used for the evaluation. 
The study was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, crossover, 
single dose, comparative oral bioequivalence study of Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets 
(manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Limited, Pithampur, India) and Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets of 
Gilead Sciences International Limited, United Kingdom in healthy adult male volunteers, under fed conditions.  
Study consisted of two periods (Period I and Period II). After 12 days of washout period, in Period II, the 
subjects have been administered by the other drug that they have not been administered in the Period I. After 
10 hours of overnight fasting, patients were given high-fat high-calorie non vegetarian breakfast ~ 800-1000 
kcal till 4 hours post dose. Subjects were housed in the clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to 
investigational product administration until after the 72 hours post dose in both the study periods. Blood 
samples were collected before dosing and up to 72 hours after each dosing period. A validated LC/MS/MS 
method by solid phase extraction was used to detect tenofovir concentrations in plasma in human Ks EDTA 
plasma matrix. The pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test to reference ratio 
of geometric mean and corresponding 90% CI for the Cmax and AUC0-t were reported as falling within 
acceptable range of 80.00 to 125%. The bioequivalence is presented under the fed condition. Both the test and 
the reference medicine were generally safe and well tolerated by the subjects included in the study. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan and justifications that the 
different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy 
of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

2.6.  PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016

subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
In line with the reference product, the SmPCs/PILs state in section 4.2 that for administration, the tablets may 
be disintegrated and mixed with at least 100 ml of water, orange juice, or grape juice prior to administration in 
patients with difficulties swallowing tablets whole. The applicant has provided data as requested by the CHMP in 
support of the alternative method of administration. Although the BE was demonstrated with tablets taken 
whole, the data provided support the applicability of specific administration recommendation in the reference 
product (Viread) SmPC to Tenofovir Disoproxil Mylan. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of tenofovir disoproxil film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Viread is indicated for treatment of HIV infection and treatment of chronic hepatitis B. No nonclinical studies 
have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the 
active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not 
contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the 
active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open-label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two 
treatment, two sequence, two period crossover, bioequivalence study under fed conditions in healthy subjects.  
The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line 
with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as 
wash-out period was adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods 
applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of tenofovir disoproxil met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with the Viread. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and 
Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016 
Page 34/38 
 
  
  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
HIV-1 infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. 
In adults, the demonstration of the benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one 
study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in 
which tenofovir disoproxil was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral 
pre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of patients 
having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years. 
The choice of tenofovir disoproxil to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
Hepatitis B infection 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults 
with: 
• 
compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis (see section 5.1). 
• 
• 
evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in 
adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age with: 
• 
compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, 
persistently elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis (see 
sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016 
Page 35/38 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to prescribe/use 
Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan in adults and/or paediatric patients are provided with a physician educational pack 
containing the Summary of Product Characteristics and an appropriate educational brochure, as detailed below: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
HIV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HBV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HIV paediatric educational brochure 
HBV paediatric educational brochure 
The HIV and HBV renal educational brochures should contain the following key messages: 
• 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil-containing products such as Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
• 
That Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should only be used in patients with impaired renal function if the 
potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks 
Assessment report  
EMA/798405/2016 
Page 36/38 
 
  
  
 
• 
The importance of dose interval adjustment of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan in adult patients with 
creatinine clearance of 30-49 ml/min 
• 
That Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). If no alternative treatment is available, prolonged dose intervals may be 
used 
• 
That use of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic 
medicinal products. If Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function 
should be closely monitored according to the recommended schedule 
• 
That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan therapy 
• 
• 
The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan therapy 
Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of additional 
risk factors for renal impairment 
• 
That if serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance decreases during therapy to < 50 ml/min 
then renal function should be re-evaluated within one week. If creatinine clearance is confirmed as < 50 ml/min 
or serum phosphate decreases to < 1.0 mg/dl then consideration should be given to interrupting Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan therapy. Interrupting treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should also be considered in

Instructions on the use of the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
The HIV and HBV paediatric educational brochures should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
That a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of paediatric patients 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil-containing products such as Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
• 
• 
That Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended for use in paediatric patients with renal impairment 
That use of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic 
medicinal products. If Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function 
should be closely monitored according to the recommended schedule 
• 
That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan therapy 
• 
• 
The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan therapy 
Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of additional 
risk factors for renal impairment 
• 
That if serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving 
tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week. If renal abnormalities are detected 
or suspected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to consider interruption of Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan treatment. Interrupting treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should also be considered in 
case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.

That Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may cause a reduction in BMD and the effects of Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan associated changes in BMD on long term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown in 
paediatric patients 
• 
That if bone abnormalities are detected or suspected then consultation with an endocrinologist and/or 
nephrologist should be obtained

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lopinavir/ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children above the age of 
2 years. 
The choice of lopinavir/ritonavir to treat protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lopinavir/ritonavir should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV 
infection. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed.

Adults and adolescents 
The standard recommended dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets is 400/100 mg (two 200/50 mg) tablets 
twice daily taken with or without food. In adult patients, in cases where once daily dosing is considered 
necessary for the management of the patient, lopinavir/ritonavir tablets may be administered as 
800/200 mg (four 200/50 mg tablets) once daily with or without food. The use of a once daily dosing should 
be limited to those adult patients having only very few protease inhibitor (PI) associated mutations (i.e. less 
than 3 PI mutations in line with clinical trial results, see section 5.1 for the full description of the population) 
and should take into account the risk of a lesser sustainability of the virologic suppression (see section 5.1) 
and higher risk of diarrhoea (see section 4.8) compared to the recommended standard twice daily dosing.  
Paediatric population (2 years of age and above) 
The adult dose of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) may be used in children 40 kg or 
greater or with a Body Surface Area (BSA)* greater than 1.4 m2. For children weighing less than 40 kg or 
with a BSA between 0.5 and 1.4 m2 and able to swallow tablets, please refer to the dosing guideline tables 
below. Based on the current data available, lopinavir/ritonavir should not be administered once daily in 
paediatric patients (see section 5.1).  
Before prescribing lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg tablets, infants and young children should be assessed for 
the ability to swallow intact tablets. For infants and young children unable to swallow tablets, more suitable 
formulations containing lopinavir/ritonavir should be checked for their availability. 
The following table contains dosing guidelines for lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg tablets based on body 
weight and BSA.

If more convenient for patients, the lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg tablets may also be considered alone or in 
combination with the lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg tablet to achieve the recommended dose.  
* Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation: 
BSA (m2) = √ (Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 3600) 
Children less than 2 years of age 
The safety and efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

Hepatic impairment  
In HIV-infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, an increase of approximately 30% in 
lopinavir exposure has been observed but is not expected to be of clinical relevance (see section 5.2). No 
data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Lopinavir/ritonavir must not be given to these 
patients (see section 4.3).  
Renal impairment  
Since the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are not 
expected in patients with renal impairment. Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein bound, it is 
unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  
Pregnancy and postpartum  
• 
• 
No dose adjustment is required for lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum.  
Once daily administration of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended for pregnant women due to the 
lack of pharmacokinetic and clinical data.  
Method of administration 
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets are administered orally and must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or 
crushed. Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe hepatic insufficiency. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan tablets contain lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 
isoform CYP3A. Lopinavir/ritonavir should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with coexisting conditions 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir has not been established in patients with significant underlying 
liver disorders. Lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (see 
section 4.3). Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at 
an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral 
therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.  
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver 
function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to 
standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or 
discontinuation of treatment should be considered.  
Elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 mono-infected 
and in individuals treated for post-exposure prophylaxis as early as 7 days after the initiation of 
lopinavir/ritonavir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. In some cases the hepatic dysfunction was 
serious.  
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and 
close monitoring should be performed during treatment.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment  
Since the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are not 
expected in patients with renal impairment. Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein bound, it is 
unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Haemophilia 
There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and haemarthrosis in 
patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor 
VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or 
reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship had been evoked, although the 
mechanism of action had not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the 
possibility of increased bleeding.  
Pancreatitis  
Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir, including those who 
developed hypertriglyceridaemia. In most of these cases patients have had a prior history of pancreatitis 
and/or concurrent therapy with other medicinal products associated with pancreatitis. Marked triglyceride 
elevation is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis. Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at risk 
of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis. 
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities 
in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis should 
occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy 
should be suspended if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome  
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens 
may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have 
been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jiroveci 
pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.  
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur 
in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment.  
Osteonecrosis  
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly 
in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy 
(CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement.  
PR interval prolongation  
Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some 
healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying 
structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving 
lopinavir/ritonavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution in such patients (see section 5.1).  
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such 
changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for 
a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. 
For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid 
disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Interactions with medicinal products  
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan tablets contain lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the 
P450 isoform CYP3A. Lopinavir/ritonavir is likely to increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. These increases of plasma concentrations of co-administered 
medicinal products could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see sections 4.3 and 
4.5).  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could 
potentially increase the risk of bedaquiline related adverse reactions. Therefore, combination of bedaquiline 
with lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided. However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of 
bedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir must be done with caution. More frequent electrocardiogram monitoring 
and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the bedaquiline SmPC). 
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (as lopinavir/ritonavir) may increase 
exposure to delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation. Therefore, if co-
administration of delamanid with lopinavir/ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the delamanid 
SmPC). 
Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir. Concomitant administration with colchicine is contraindicated in patients 
with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  
The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
tadalafil, indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is not recommended 
(see section 4.5);  
riociguat is not recommended (see section 4.5); 
vorapaxar is not recommended (see section 4.5); 
fusidic acid in osteo-articular infections is not recommended (see section 4.5);  
salmeterol is not recommended (see section 4.5);  
rivaroxaban is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with atorvastatin is not recommended. If the use of atorvastatin is 
considered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with careful 
safety monitoring. Caution must also be exercised and reduced doses should be considered if 
lopinavir/ritonavir is used concurrently with rosuvastatin. If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 
is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5).  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PDE5 inhibitors 
Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with these 
medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated 
adverse events such as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use of avanafil or vardenafil and lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with 
lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  
Particular caution must be used when prescribing lopinavir/ritonavir and medicinal products known to induce 
QT interval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin. Indeed, 
lopinavir/ritonavir could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may 
result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. Cardiac events have been reported with 
lopinavir/ritonavir in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of lopinavir/ritonavir cannot 
be currently ruled out (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).  
Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with rifampicin is not recommended. Rifampicin in combination 
with lopinavir/ritonavir causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn significantly 
decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect. Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved when a 
higher dose of lopinavir/ritonavir is used but this is associated with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal 
toxicity. Therefore, this co-administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary (see 
section 4.5).  
Concomitant use of lopinavir/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by 
CYP3A4, such as budesonide and triamcinolone, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of 
treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal 
suppression (see section 4.5).  
Other  
Lopinavir/ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. People taking lopinavir/ritonavir may still 
develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease and AIDS. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan tablets contain lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the 
P450 isoform CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and medicinal products primarily 
metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which 
could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions. Lopinavir/ritonavir does not inhibit CYP2D6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3). 
Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the 
biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (including 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) and by glucuronidation. This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and 
potential decrease of efficacy of co-administered medicinal products.  
Medicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and 
potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3.  
All interaction studies, when otherwise not stated, were performed using lopinavir/ritonavir capsules, which 
gives an approximately 20% lower exposure of lopinavir than the 200/50 mg tablets.

contraindicated (see section 4.3) as 
the risk of arrhythmias or other 
serious adverse reactions may be 
increased.
Caution is warranted and therapeutic 
drug monitoring of digoxin 
concentrations, if available, is 
recommended in case of co-
administration of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan and digoxin. Particular caution 
should be used when prescribing 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan in patients 
taking digoxin as the acute inhibitory 
effect of ritonavir on Pgp is expected 
to significantly increase digoxin 
levels. Initiation of digoxin in patients 
already taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan is likely to result in lower than 
expected increases of digoxin 
concentrations.  
Caution is warranted and therapeutic 
drug concentration monitoring is 
recommended when available. 
For patients with renal impairment 
(CrCL < 30 ml/min) dose reduction of

Co-administration of encorafenib with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan may 
increase encorafenib exposure which 
may increase the risk of toxicity, 
including the risk of serious adverse 
events such as QT interval 
prolongation.  Co administration of 
encorafenib and Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan should be avoided.  If the 
benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risk and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
must be used, patients should be 
carefully monitored for safety. 
Co-administration of fostamatinib 
with Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan may 
increase fostamatinib metabolite R406 
exposure resulting in dose-related 
adverse events such as hepatotoxicity, 
neutropenia, hypertension, or 
diarrhoea. Refer to the fostamatinib 
SmPC for dose reduction 
recommendations if such events 
occur. 
Co-administration of ibrutinib and 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan may 
increase ibrutinib exposure which 
may increase the risk of toxicity 
including risk of tumor lysis 
syndrome. Co administration of 
ibrutinib and Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan should be avoided.  If the 
benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risk and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
must be used, reduce the ibrutinib 
dose to 140 mg and monitor patient 
closely for toxicity. 
Concomitant use of neratinib with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is 
contraindicated due to serious and/or 
life threatening potential reactions 
including hepatotoxicity (see section 
4.3). 
15 
 
 
 
Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
Serum concentrations may be 
increased due to CYP3A inhibition by 
lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in 
increased risk of tumor lysis 
syndrome at the dose initiation and 
during the ramp-up phase (see section 
4.3 and refer to the venetoclax 
SmPC). 
For patients who have completed the 
ramp-up phase and are on a steady 
daily dose of venetoclax, reduce the 
venetoclax dose by at least 75% when 
used with strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(refer to the venetoclax SmPC for 
dosing instructions).  Patients should 
be closely monitored for signs related 
to venetoclax toxicities. 
It is recommended that INR 
(international normalised ratio) be 
monitored.  
Co-administration of rivaroxaban and 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan may 
increase rivaroxaban exposure which 
may increase the risk of bleeding.  
The use of rivaroxaban is not 
recommended in patients receiving 
concomitant treatment with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan (see 
section 4.4).  
Clinical monitoring and/or dose 
reduction of the direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOAC) should be 
considered when a DOAC transported 
by P-gp but not metabolised by

Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
Patients should be monitored closely 
for a decreased VPA effect when 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and 
valproic acid or valproate are given 
concomitantly. 
In patients starting or stopping 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan while 
currently taking maintenance dose of 
lamotrigine:  
lamotrigine dose may need to be 
increased if Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan is added, or decreased if 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is 
discontinued; therefore plasma 
lamotrigine monitoring should be 
conducted, particularly before and 
during 2 weeks after starting or 
stopping Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan, 
in order to see if lamotrigine dose 
adjustment is needed.  
In patients currently taking 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and 
starting lamotrigine: no dose 
adjustments to the recommended dose 
escalation of lamotrigine should be 
necessary.  
It is unknown whether the 
combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan causes a similar increase in 
trazodone exposure. The combination 
should be used with caution and a 
lower dose of trazodone should be 
considered.  
High doses of ketoconazole and 
itraconazole (> 200 mg/day) are not 
recommended.  
Co-administration of voriconazole and 
low dose ritonavir (100 mg BID) as 
contained in Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan tablets should be avoided 
unless an assessment of the 
benefit/risk to patient justifies the use 
of voriconazole.

Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
Concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
colchicine in patients with renal 
and/or hepatic impairment is 
contraindicated due to a potential 
increase of colchicine-related serious 
and/or life-threatening reactions such 
as neuromuscular toxicity (including 
rhabdomyolysis) (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). A reduction in colchicine 
dosage or an interruption of colchicine 
treatment is recommended in patients 
with normal renal or hepatic function 
if treatment with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan is required. Refer to colchicine 
prescribing information. 
Concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and 
astemizole and terfenadine is 
contraindicated as it may increase the 
risk of serious arrhythmias from these 
agents (see section 4.3).

Concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
fusidic acid is contra-indicated in 
dermatological indications due to the 
increased risk of adverse events 
related to fusidic acid, notably 
rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3). 
When used for osteo-articular 
infections, where the co-
administration is unavoidable, close 
clinical monitoring for muscular 
adverse events is strongly 
recommended (see section 4.4).  
Due to the risk of bedaquiline related 
adverse events, the combination of 
bedaquiline and Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan should be avoided. If the 
benefit outweighs the risk, 
co-administration of bedaquiline with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan must be 
done with caution. More frequent 
electrocardiogram monitoring and 
monitoring of transaminases is 
recommended (see section 4.4 and 
refer to the bedaquiline SmPC). 
Due to the risk of QTc prolongation 
associated with DM-6705, if co-
administration of delamanid with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is 
considered necessary, very frequent 
ECG monitoring throughout the full 
delamanid treatment period is 
recommended (see section 4.4 and 
refer to the delamanid SmPC).

Rifampicin 
Lopinavir:  
Large decreases in lopinavir 
concentrations may be observed due 
to CYP3A induction by rifampicin. 
Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
When given with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan the recommended dose of 
rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week 
on set days (for example Monday-
Wednesday-Friday). Increased 
monitoring for rifabutin-associated 
adverse reactions including 
neutropenia and uveitis is warranted 
due to an expected increase in 
exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage 
reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice 
weekly on set days is recommended 
for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 
3 times per week is not tolerated. It 
should be kept in mind that the twice 
weekly dosage of 150 mg may not 
provide an optimal exposure to 
rifabutin thus leading to a risk of 
rifamycin resistance and a treatment 
failure. No dose adjustment is needed 
for Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan.  
Co-administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
rifampicin is not recommended as the 
decrease in lopinavir concentrations 
may in turn significantly decrease the 
lopinavir therapeutic effect. A dose 
adjustment of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan 400 mg/400 mg (i.e. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
400/100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg) twice 
daily has allowed compensating for 
the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of 
rifampicin. However, such a dose 
adjustment might be associated with 
ALT/AST elevations and with 
increase in gastrointestinal disorders. 
Therefore, this co-administration 
should be avoided unless judged 
strictly necessary. If this co-
administration is judged unavoidable, 
increased dose of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily 
may be administered with rifampicin 
under close safety and therapeutic 
drug monitoring. The 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan dose 
should be titrated upward only after 
rifampicin has been initiated (see 
section 4.4).

Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
The concomitant administration with 
lurasidone is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and 
pimozide is contraindicated as it may 
increase the risk of serious 
haematologic abnormalities or other 
serious adverse effects from this agent 
(see section 4.3) 
Concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and 
quetiapine is contraindicated as it may 
increase quetiapine-related toxicity. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan must not 
be co-administered with oral 
midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas 
caution should be used with co-
administration of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan and parenteral midazolam. If 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is co-
administered with parenteral 
midazolam, it should be done in an 
intensive care unit (ICU) or similar 
setting which ensures close clinical 
monitoring and appropriate medical 
management in case of respiratory 
depression and/or prolonged sedation. 
Dosage adjustment for midazolam 
should be considered especially if 
more than a single dose of midazolam 
is administered.  
The combination may result in 
increased risk of cardiovascular 
adverse events associated with 
salmeterol, including QT 
prolongation, palpitations and sinus 
tachycardia. 
Therefore, concomitant administration 
of Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
salmeterol is not recommended (see 
section 4.4).  
Clinical monitoring of therapeutic and 
adverse effects is recommended when 
these medicines are concomitantly 
administered with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan.

Clinical monitoring of antiviral 
efficacy is recommended when these 
medicines are concomitantly

Mylan. 
Greater effects may be expected when 
fluticasone propionate is inhaled. 
Systemic corticosteroid effects 
including Cushing's syndrome and 
adrenal suppression have been 
reported in patients receiving ritonavir 
and inhaled or intranasally 
administered fluticasone propionate; 
this could also occur with other 
corticosteroids metabolised via the 
P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide and 
triamcinolone. Consequently, 
concomitant administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and these 
glucocorticoids is not recommended 
unless the potential benefit of 
treatment outweighs the risk of 
systemic corticosteroid effects (see 
section 4.4). A dose reduction of the 
glucocorticoid should be considered 
with close monitoring of local and 
systemic effects or a switch to a 
glucocorticoid, which is not a 
substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. 
beclomethasone). Moreover, in case 
of withdrawal of glucocorticoids 
progressive dose reduction may have 
to be performed over a longer period.

Mechanism of interaction  
Lopinavir:  
Concentrations may be reduced due

Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
Herbal preparations containing St 
John’s wort must not be combined 
with lopinavir and ritonavir. If a 
patient is already taking St John’s 
wort, stop St John’s wort and if 
possible check viral levels. Lopinavir 
and ritonavir levels may increase on 
stopping St John’s wort. The dose of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan may need 
adjusting. The inducing effect may 
persist for at least 2 weeks after 
cessation of treatment with St John’s 
wort (see section 4.3). Therefore, 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan can be 
started safely 2 weeks after cessation 
of St John's wort.

Lipid-modifying agents 
Lomitapide 
Atorvastatin 
CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the 
exposure of lomitapide, with strong 
inhibitors increasing exposure 
approximately 27-fold. Due to 
CYP3A inhibition by 
lopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations of 
lomitapide are expected to increase. 
Atorvastatin:  
AUC: ↑ 5.9-fold  
Cmax: ↑ 4.7-fold  
Due to CYP3A inhibition by 
lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Since increased concentrations of 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may 
cause myopathy, including 
rhabdomyolysis, the combination of 
these agents with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
Mylan is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  
Concomitant use of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
lomitapide is contraindicated (see 
prescribing information for 
lomitapide) (see section 4.3). 
The combination of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
atorvastatin is not recommended. If 
the use of atorvastatin is considered 
strictly necessary, the lowest possible 
dose of atorvastatin should be 
administered with careful safety 
monitoring (see section 4.4).

containing products and 
levothyroxine. 
Clinical recommendation 
concerning co-administration with 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
Caution should be exercised and 
reduced doses should be considered 
when Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is 
co-administered with rosuvastatin (see 
section 4.4).  
If treatment with an HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitor is indicated, 
fluvastatin or pravastatin is 
recommended. 
No dose adjustment necessary. 
Monitoring plasma concentrations of 
methadone is recommended.
In case of co-administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
contraceptives containing ethinyl 
oestradiol (whatever the contraceptive 
formulation e.g. oral or patch), 
additional methods of contraception 
must be used. 
If the co-administration of 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with 
bupropion is judged unavoidable, this 
should be done under close clinical 
monitoring for bupropion efficacy, 
without exceeding the recommended 
dosage, despite the observed 
induction. 
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
should be monitored in patients 
treated with levothyroxine at least the 
first month after starting and/or 
ending lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.

Mylan with bosentan.  
When Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is 
administered concomitantly with 
bosentan, the efficacy of the HIV 
therapy should be monitored and 
patients should be closely observed 
for bosentan toxicity, especially 
during the first week of co-
administration.  
The co-administration of riociguat 
with Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is not 
recommended (see section 4.4 and 
refer to riociguat SmPC). 
Other medicinal products 
Based on known metabolic profiles, clinically significant interactions are not expected between 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan and dapsone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin or fluconazole. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant 
women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, the animal data 
as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in order to characterise the 
safety for the foetus.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir has been evaluated in over 3000 women during pregnancy, including over 1000 during 
the first trimester.  
In post-marketing surveillance through the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, established since January 
1989, an increased risk of birth defects exposures with lopinavir/ritonavir has not been reported among over 
1000 women exposed during the first trimester. The prevalence of birth defects after any trimester exposure 
to lopinavir is comparable to the prevalence observed in the general population. No pattern of birth defects 
suggestive of a common etiology was seen. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Based on the data mentioned, the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. Lopinavir can be 
used during pregnancy if clinically needed. 
Breast-feeding  
Studies in rats revealed that lopinavir is excreted in the milk. It is not known whether this medicinal product 
is excreted in human milk. As a general rule, it is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-
feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.  
Fertility  
Animal studies have shown no effects on fertility. No human data on the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on 
fertility are available.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients should be 
informed that nausea has been reported during treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of lopinavir/ritonavir has been investigated in over 2600 patients in Phase II-IV clinical trials, of 
which over 700 have received a dose of 800/200 mg (6 capsules or 4 tablets) once daily. Along with 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, lopinavir/ritonavir was used in 
combination with efavirenz or nevirapine.  
The most common adverse reactions related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy during clinical trials were 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia. The risk of diarrhoea may be 
greater with once daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting may occur at the 
beginning of the treatment while hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later. Treatment 
emergent adverse events led to premature study discontinuation for 7% of subjects from Phase II-IV studies.  
It is important to note that cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir, 
including those who developed hypertriglyceridaemia. Furthermore, rare increases in PR interval have been 
reported during lopinavir/ritonavir therapy (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult and paediatric patients:  
The following events have been identified as adverse reactions. The frequency category includes all reported 
events of moderate to severe intensity, regardless of the individual causality assessment. The adverse 
reactions are displayed by system organ class. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Cushing’s syndrome has been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally 
administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the 
P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide (see section 4.4 and 4.5). 
Increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported 
with protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.  
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral 
therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment 
(see section 4.4).  
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, 
advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency 
of this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric populations 
In children 2 years of age and older, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults (see Table 
in section b). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
To date, there is limited human experience of acute overdose with lopinavir/ritonavir.  
The adverse clinical signs observed in dogs included salivation, emesis and diarrhoea/abnormal stool. The 
signs of toxicity observed in mice, rats or dogs included decreased activity, ataxia, emaciation, dehydration 
and tremors.  
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lopinavir/ritonavir. Treatment of overdose with 
lopinavir/ritonavir is to consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and 
observation of the clinical status of the patient. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance is to 
be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in 
removal of unabsorbed active substance. Since lopinavir/ritonavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is 
unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the active substance. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations, ATC code: J05AR10 
Mechanism of action 
Lopinavir provides the antiviral activity of lopinavir/ritonavir. Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 and 
HIV-2 proteases. Inhibition of HIV protease prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein resulting in the 
production of immature, non-infectious virus. 
Effects on the electrocardiogram 
QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) 
controlled crossover study in 39 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3. The 
maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF from placebo were 3.6 (6.3) and 
13.1(15.8) for 400/100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800/200 mg twice daily LPV/r, respectively. The 
induced QRS interval prolongation from 6 ms to 9.5 ms with high dose lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg 
twice daily) contributes to QT prolongation. The two regimens resulted in exposures on Day 3 which were 
approximately 1.5 and 3-fold higher than those observed with recommended once daily or twice daily LPV/r 
31 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doses at steady state. No subject experienced an increase in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms from baseline or a QTcF 
interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 ms.  
Modest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in the same 
study on Day 3. The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.6 ms to 24.4 ms in the 
12 hour interval post dose. Maximum PR interval was 286 ms and no second or third degree heart block was 
observed (see section 4.4).  
Antiviral activity in vitro 
The in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against laboratory and clinical HIV strains was evaluated in acutely 
infected lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, respectively. In the absence of human 
serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against five different HIV-1 laboratory strains was 19 nM. In the absence 
and presence of 50% human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against HIV-1IIIB in MT4 cells was 17 nM and 
102 nM, respectively. In the absence of human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir was 6.5 nM against several 
HIV-1 clinical isolates.  
Resistance  
In vitro selection of resistance 
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in vitro. HIV-1 has been passaged 
in vitro with lopinavir alone and with lopinavir plus ritonavir at concentration ratios representing the range of 
plasma concentration ratios observed during lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. Genotypic and phenotypic analysis 
of viruses selected in these passages suggest that the presence of ritonavir, at these concentration ratios, does 
not measurably influence the selection of lopinavir-resistant viruses. Overall, the in vitro characterisation of 
phenotypic cross-resistance between lopinavir and other protease inhibitors suggest that decreased 
susceptibility to lopinavir correlated closely with decreased susceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did 
not correlate closely with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir.  
Analysis of resistance in ARV-naïve patients  
In clinical studies with a limited number of isolates analysed, the selection of resistance to lopinavir has not 
been observed in naïve patients without significant protease inhibitor resistance at baseline. See further the 
detailed description of the clinical studies.  
Analysis of resistance in PI-experienced patients 
The selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was 
characterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in 
2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral 
rebound subsequent to initial response to lopinavir/ritonavir and who demonstrated incremental in vitro 
resistance between baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in 
phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir). Incremental resistance was most common in subjects whose baseline 
isolates had several protease inhibitor-associated mutations, but < 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir 
at baseline. Mutations V82A, I54V and M46I emerged most frequently. Mutations L33F, I50V and V32I 
combined with I47V/A were also observed. The 19 isolates demonstrated a 4.3-fold increase in IC50 
compared to baseline isolates (from 6.2- to 43-fold, compared to wild-type virus).  
Genotypic correlates of reduced phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir in viruses selected by other protease 
inhibitors. The in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against 112 clinical isolates taken from patients failing 
therapy with one or more protease inhibitors was assessed. Within this panel, the following mutations in HIV 
protease were associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir: L10F/I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, 
M46I/L, F53L, I54L/T/V, L63P, A71I/L/T/V, V82A/F/T, I84V and L90M. The median EC50 of lopinavir 
against isolates with 0 − 3, 4 − 5, 6 − 7 and 8 − 10 mutations at the above amino acid positions was 0.8, 2.7, 
13.5 and 44.0-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type HIV, respectively. The 16 viruses that displayed > 
20-fold change in susceptibility all contained mutations at positions 10, 54, 63 plus 82 and/or 84. In addition, 
they contained a median of 3 mutations at amino acid positions 20, 24, 46, 53, 71 and 90. In addition to the 
mutations described above, mutations V32I and I47A have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lopinavir susceptibility from protease inhibitor experienced patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, 
and mutations I47A and L76V have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir susceptibility 
from patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.  
Conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to change with 
additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems for analysing 
resistance test results.  
Antiviral activity of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients failing protease inhibitor therapy 
The clinical relevance of reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir has been examined by assessing the 
virologic response to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, with respect to baseline viral genotype and phenotype, in 56 
patients previous failing therapy with multiple protease inhibitors. The EC50 of lopinavir against the 56 
baseline viral isolates ranged from 0.6 to 96-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type HIV. After 48 weeks 
of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma HIV 
RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml was observed in 93% (25/27), 73% (11/15), and 25% (2/8) of patients with < 10-fold, 
10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively. In addition, 
virologic response was observed in 91% (21/23), 71% (15/21) and 33% (2/6) patients with 0 − 5, 6 − 7, and 8 
− 10 mutations of the above mutations in HIV protease associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to 
lopinavir. Since these patients had not previously been exposed to either lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz, part 
of the response may be attributed to the antiviral activity of efavirenz, particularly in patients harbouring 
highly lopinavir resistant virus. The study did not contain a control arm of patients not receiving 
lopinavir/ritonavir.  
Cross-resistance 
Activity of other protease inhibitors against isolates that developed incremental resistance to lopinavir after 
lopinavir/ritonavir therapy in protease inhibitor experienced patients: The presence of cross resistance to 
other protease inhibitors was analysed in 18 rebound isolates that had demonstrated evolution of resistance to 
lopinavir during 3 Phase II and one Phase III studies of lopinavir/ritonavir in protease inhibitor-experienced 
patients. The median fold IC50 of lopinavir for these 18 isolates at baseline and rebound was 6.9- and 63-fold, 
respectively, compared to wild type virus. In general, rebound isolates either retained (if cross-resistant at 
baseline) or developed significant cross-resistance to indinavir, saquinavir and atazanavir. Modest decreases 
in amprenavir activity were noted with a median increase of IC50 from 3.7- to 8-fold in the baseline and 
rebound isolates, respectively. Isolates retained susceptibility to tipranavir with a median increase of IC50 in 
baseline and rebound isolates of 1.9- and 1.8–fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus. Please refer to 
the Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics for additional information on the use of tipranavir, 
including genotypic predictors of response, in treatment of lopinavir-resistant HIV-1 infection.  
Clinical results  
The effects of lopinavir/ritonavir (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers 
(plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts) have been investigated in controlled studies of 
lopinavir/ritonavir of 48 to 360 weeks duration.  
Adult Use  
Patients without prior antiretroviral therapy  
Study M98-863 was a randomised, double-blind trial of 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients 
investigating lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) 
plus stavudine and lamivudine. Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 259 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 
949 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.9 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to 
6.8 log10 copies/ml).

One-hundred thirteen nelfinavir-treated patients and 74 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients had an HIV RNA 
above 400 copies/ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96. Of these, isolates from 
96 nelfinavir-treated patients and 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients could be amplified for resistance 
testing. Resistance to nelfinavir, defined as the presence of the D30N or L90M mutation in protease, was 
observed in 41/96 (43%) patients. Resistance to lopinavir, defined as the presence of any primary or active 
site mutations in protease (see above), was observed in 0/51 (0%) patients. Lack of resistance to lopinavir 
was confirmed by phenotypic analysis.  
Study M05-730 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial comparing treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 
800/200 mg once daily plus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine versus lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice 
daily plus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine in 664 antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients. Given the 
pharmacokinetic interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and tenofovir (see section 4.5), the results of this 
study might not be strictly extrapolable when other backbone regimens are used with lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg once daily (n = 333) 
or lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 331). Further stratification within each group was 1:1 
(tablet versus. soft capsule). Patients were administered either the tablet or the soft capsule formulation for 
8 weeks, after which all patients were administered the tablet formulation once daily or twice daily for the 
remainder of the study. Patients were administered emtricitabine 200 mg once daily and tenofovir DF 
300 mg once daily (equivalent to 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil). Protocol defined non-inferiority of once daily 
dosing compared with twice daily dosing was demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in proportion of subjects responding (once daily minus twice daily) excluded -12% 
at Week 48. Mean age of patients enrolled was 39 years (range: 19 to 71); 75% were Caucasian, and 78% 
were male. Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 216 cells/mm3 (range: 20 to 775 cells/mm3) and mean 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log10 copies/ml (range: 1.7 to 7.0 log10 copies/ml).

demonstrated lopinavir resistance, and in the BID group, 1 patient who had significant protease inhibitor

Sustained virological response to lopinavir/ritonavir (in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors) has been also observed in a small Phase II study (M97-720) through 360 weeks of 
treatment. One hundred patients were originally treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in the study (including 
51 patients receiving 400/100 mg twice daily and 49 patients at either 200/100 mg twice daily or 400/200 mg 
twice daily). All patients converted to open-label lopinavir/ritonavir at the 400/100 mg twice daily dose 
between week 48 and week 72. Thirty-nine patients (39%) discontinued the study, including 16 (16%) 
discontinuations due to adverse events, one of which was associated with a death. Sixty-one patients 
completed the study (35 patients received the recommended 400/100 mg twice daily dose throughout the 
study).

Through 360 weeks of treatment, genotypic analysis of viral isolates was successfully conducted in 19 of 
28 patients with confirmed HIV RNA above 400 copies/ml revealed no primary or active site mutations in 
protease (amino acids at positions 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 82, 84 and 90) or protease inhibitor phenotypic 
resistance. 
Patients with prior antiretroviral therapy  
M06-802 was a randomised open-label study comparing the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of 
oncedaily and twice daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets in 599 subjects with detectable viral loads 
while receiving their current antiviral therapy. Patients had not been on prior lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. 
They were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg once daily (n = 300) or 
lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 299). Patients were administered at least two 
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors selected by the investigator. The enrolled population 
was moderately PI-experienced with more than half of patients having never received prior PI and around 
80% of patients presenting a viral strain with less than 3 PI mutations. Mean age of patients enrolled was 
41 years (range: 21 to 73); 51% were Caucasian and 66% were male. Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 
254 cells/mm3 (range: 4 to 952 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10 copies/ml 
(range: 1.7 to 6.6 log10 copies/ml). Around 85% of patients had a viral load of < 100,000 copies/ml.

Through Week 48, genotypic resistance testing results were available from 75 patients in the QD group and 
75 patients in the BID group who had incomplete virologic response. In the QD group, 6/75 (8%) patients 
demonstrated new primary protease inhibitor mutations (codons 30, 32, 48, 50, 82, 84, 90), as did 12/77 
(16%) patients in the BID group. 
Paediatric Use 
M98-940 was an open-label study of a liquid formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir in 100 antiretroviral naïve 
(44%) and experienced (56%) paediatric patients. All patients were non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor naïve. Patients were randomised to either 230 mg lopinavir/57.5 mg ritonavir per m2 or 300 mg 
lopinavir/75 mg ritonavir per m2. Naïve patients also received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after 3 weeks of therapy in 
each patient. Subsequently, all patients were continued on the 300/75 mg per m2 dose. Patients had a mean 
age of 5 years (range 6 months to 12 years) with 14 patients less than 2 years old and 6 patients one year or 
less. Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 838 cells/mm3 and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 
4.7 log10 copies/ml.

KONCERT/PENTA 18 is a prospective multicentre, randomised, open-label study that evaluated the 
pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy and safety of twice-daily versus once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir 
100 mg/25 mg tablets dosed by weight as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in virologically 
suppressed HIV-1 infected children (n=173). Children were eligible when they were aged <18 years, ≥15 kg 
in weight, receiving cART that included lopinavir/ritonavir, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/ml 
for at least 24 weeks and able to swallow tablets. At week 48, the efficacy and safety with twice-daily dosing 
(n=87) in the paediatric population given lopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg tablets was consistent with the 
efficacy and safety findings in previous adult and paediatric studies using lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily. The 
percentage of patients with confirmed viral rebound ≥50 copies/ml during 48 weeks of follow-up was higher 
in the paediatric patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets once daily (12%) than in patients receiving the 
twice-daily dosing (8%, p = 0.19), mainly due to lower adherence in the once-daily group. The efficacy data 
favouring the twice-daily regimen are reinforced by a differential in pharmacokinetic parameters 
significantly favouring the twice-daily regimen (see section 5.2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of lopinavir co-administered with ritonavir have been evaluated in healthy 
adult volunteers and in HIV-infected patients; no substantial differences were observed between the two 
groups. Lopinavir is essentially completely metabolised by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of 
lopinavir, thereby increasing the plasma levels of lopinavir. Across studies, administration of 
lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily yields mean steady-state lopinavir plasma concentrations 15 to 
20-fold higher than those of ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. The plasma levels of ritonavir are less than 
7% of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily. The in vitro antiviral EC50 of lopinavir is 
approximately 10-fold lower than that of ritonavir. Therefore, the antiviral activity of lopinavir/ritonavir is 
due to lopinavir.  
36 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
Multiple dosing with 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily for 2 weeks and without meal restriction 
produced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 12.3 ± 5.4 μg/ml, occurring 
approximately 4 hours after administration. The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the morning 
dose was 8.1 ± 5.7 μg/ml. Lopinavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 113.2 ± 60.5 μg•h/ml. 
The absolute bioavailability of lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir in humans has not been established.  
Effects of food on oral absorption  
Administration of a single 400/100 mg dose of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets under fed conditions (high fat, 872 
kcal, 56% from fat) compared to fasted state was associated with no significant changes in Cmax and AUCinf. 
Therefore, lopinavir/ritonavir tablets may be taken with or without food. Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have also 
shown less pharmacokinetic variability under all meal conditions compared to lopinavir/ritonavir soft 
capsules.  
Distribution  
At steady state, lopinavir is approximately 98 − 99% bound to serum proteins. Lopinavir binds to both alpha-
1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin however, it has a higher affinity for AAG. At steady state, lopinavir 
protein binding remains constant over the range of observed concentrations after 400/100 mg 
lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily, and is similar between healthy volunteers and HIV-positive patients.  
Biotransformation 
In vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicate that lopinavir primarily undergoes oxidative 
metabolism. Lopinavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, almost 
exclusively by isozyme CYP3A. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor which inhibits the metabolism of 
lopinavir and therefore, increases plasma levels of lopinavir. A 14C-lopinavir study in humans showed that 
89% of the plasma radioactivity after a single 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir dose was due to parent active 
substance. At least 13 lopinavir oxidative metabolites have been identified in man. The 4-oxo and 4-
hydroxymetabolite epimeric pair are the major metabolites with antiviral activity, but comprise only minute 
amounts of total plasma radioactivity. Ritonavir has been shown to induce metabolic enzymes, resulting in 
the induction of its own metabolism, and likely the induction of lopinavir metabolism. Pre-dose lopinavir 
concentrations decline with time during multiple dosing, stabilising after approximately 10 days to 2 weeks.  
Elimination 
After a 400/100 mg 14C-lopinavir/ritonavir dose, approximately 10.4 ± 2.3% and 82.6 ± 2.5% of an 
administered dose of 14C-lopinavir can be accounted for in urine and faeces, respectively. Unchanged 
lopinavir accounted for approximately 2.2% and 19.8% of the administered dose in urine and faeces, 
respectively. After multiple dosing, less than 3% of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
The effective (peak to trough) half-life of lopinavir over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 5 – 6 hours, and 
the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of lopinavir is 6 to 7 l /h.  
Once-daily dosing: the pharmacokinetics of once daily lopinavir/ritonavir have been evaluated in HIV-
infected subjects naïve to antiretroviral treatment. Lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg was administered in 
combination with emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg as part of a once-daily regimen. Multiple 
dosing of 800/200 mg lopinavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks without meal restriction (n=16) produced a 
mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 14.8 ± 3.5 μg/ml, occurring approximately 6 hours 
after administration. The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the morning dose was 5.5 ± 
5.4 μg/ml. Lopinavir AUC over a 24 hour dosing interval averaged 206.5 ± 89.7 μg h/ml.  
As compared to the BID regimen, the once-daily dosing is associated with a reduction in the Cmin/Ctrough 
values of approximately 50%.

Special populations  
Paediatrics  
There are limited pharmacokinetic data in children below 2 years of age. The pharmacokinetics of 
lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily and 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily have been studied 
in a total of 53 paediatric patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years. The lopinavir mean steady-state 
AUC, Cmax, and Cmin were 72.6 ± 31.1 μg•h/ml, 8.2 ± 2.9 μg/ml and 3.4 ± 2.1 μg/ml, respectively after 
lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily without nevirapine (n=12), and were 85.8 ± 
36.9 μg•h/ml, 10.0 ± 3.3 μg/ml and 3.6 ± 3.5 μg/ml, respectively after 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily with 
nevirapine (n=12). The 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300/75 mg/m2 twice 
daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult 
patients receiving the 400/100 mg twice daily regimen without nevirapine.  
Gender, race and age  
Lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in older people. No age or gender related 
pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race 
have not been identified.  
Pregnancy and postpartum  
In an open-label pharmacokinetic study, 12 HIV-infected pregnant women who were less than 20 weeks of 
gestation and on combination antiretroviral therapy initially received lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg (two 
200/50 mg tablets) twice daily up to a gestational age of 30 weeks. At 30 weeks age of gestation, the dose 
was increased to 500/125 mg (two 200/50 mg tablets plus one 100/25 mg tablet) twice daily until subjects 
were 2 weeks postpartum. Plasma concentrations of lopinavir were measured over four 12-hour periods 
during second trimester (20-24 weeks gestation), third trimester before dose increase (30 weeks gestation), 
third trimester after dose increase (32 weeks gestation), and at 8 weeks post-partum. The dose increase did 
not result in a significant increase in the plasma lopinavir concentration.  
In another open-label pharmacokinetic study, 19 HIV-infected pregnant women received lopinavir/ritonavir 
400/100 mg twice daily as part of combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy from before 
conception. A series of blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over the course of 12 hours in 
trimester 2 and trimester 3, at birth, and 4–6 weeks postpartum (in women who continued treatment post-
delivery) for pharmacokinetic analysis of total and unbound levels of plasma lopinavir concentrations.  
The pharmacokinetic data from HIV-1 infected pregnant women receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets 
400/100 mg twice daily are presented in Table 6 (see section 4.2).

Hepatic insufficiency 
The steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir in HIV-infected patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment were compared with those of HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic function in a 
multiple dose study with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. A limited increase in total lopinavir 
concentrations of approximately 30% has been observed which is not expected to be of clinical relevance 
(see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs identified major target organs as the liver, kidney, thyroid, 
spleen and circulating red blood cells. Hepatic changes indicated cellular swelling with focal degeneration. 
While exposure eliciting these changes were comparable to or below human clinical exposure, dosages in 
animals were over 6-fold the recommended clinical dose. Mild renal tubular degeneration was confined to 
mice exposed with at least twice the recommended human exposure; the kidney was unaffected in rats and 
dogs. Reduced serum thyroxin led to an increased release of TSH with resultant follicular cell hypertrophy in 
the thyroid glands of rats. These changes were reversible with withdrawal of the active substance and were 
absent in mice and dogs. Coombs-negative anisocytosis and poikilocytosis were observed in rats, but not in 
mice or dogs. Enlarged spleens with histiocytosis were seen in rats but not other species. Serum cholesterol 
was elevated in rodents but not dogs, while triglycerides were elevated only in mice. 
During in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (HERG) were inhibited by 30% at the 
highest concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir tested, corresponding to a lopinavir exposure 7-fold total and 
15-fold free peak plasma levels achieved in humans at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose. In 
contrast, similar concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no repolarisation delay in the canine 
cardiac Purkinje fibres. Lower concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir did not produce significant potassium 
(HERG) current blockade. Tissue distribution studies conducted in the rat did not suggest significant cardiac 
retention of the active substance; 72-hour AUC in heart was approximately 50% of measured plasma AUC. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that cardiac lopinavir levels would not be significantly higher than 
plasma levels.  
In dogs, prominent U waves on the electrocardiogram have been observed associated with prolonged PR 
interval and bradycardia. These effects have been assumed to be caused by electrolyte disturbance.  
The clinical relevance of these preclinical data is unknown, however, the potential cardiac effects of this 
product in humans cannot be ruled out (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
In rats, embryofoetotoxicity (pregnancy loss, decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal body weights, 
increased frequency of skeletal variations) and postnatal developmental toxicity (decreased survival of pups) 
was observed at maternally toxic dosages. The systemic exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir at the maternal and 
developmental toxic dosages was lower than the intended therapeutic exposure in humans.  
Long-term carcinogenicity studies of lopinavir/ritonavir in mice revealed a nongenotoxic, mitogenic 
induction of liver tumours, generally considered to have little relevance to human risk.  
Carcinogenicity studies in rats revealed no tumourigenic findings. Lopinavir/ritonavir was not found to be 
mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse 
mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration 
assays in human lymphocytes

1.  What Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is and what it is used for 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Your doctor has prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir to help to control your Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
(HIV) infection. Lopinavir/ritonavir does this by slowing down the spread of the infection in your 
body. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS  
Lopinavir/ritonavir is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected 
with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.  
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan contains the active substances lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir 
is an antiretroviral medicine. It belongs to a group of medicines called protease inhibitors.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir is prescribed for use in combination with other antiviral medicines. Your doctor 
will discuss with you and determine which medicines are best for you.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan. 
Important information  
−  
People taking lopinavir/ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
disease and AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while 
taking lopinavir/ritonavir.  
Tell your doctor if you or your child have/had  
−   Haemophilia type A and B as lopinavir/ritonavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  
−  
−  
Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  
A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or 
C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.  
Tell your doctor if you or your child experience  
−  
−  
−  
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in the legs 
and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels.  
Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels in the 
blood.  
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) 
have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and these symptoms 
may suggest this condition.  
In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and 
symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
−  
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.  
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement 
as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral 
therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression (reduction in the activity 
of the immune system), higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors 
for developing this disease.  
−   Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines. On rare 
−  
occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  
Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. 
These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).

Read the list of medicines above ‘Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with any of the following 
medicines’ for information on medicines that you must not take with lopinavir/ritonavir.  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription. 
Erectile dysfunction medicines (avanafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil)  
−  
−  
Do not take lopinavir/ritonavir if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil.  
You must not take lopinavir/ritonavir with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
section above).  
If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and lopinavir/ritonavir together, you may be at risk of side effects 
such as low blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours. 
If an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid permanent 
damage to your penis. Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. 
−  
Contraceptives  
−  
If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, 
you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as lopinavir/ritonavir 
may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives.   
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
− 
−  
−  
Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.  
If you are breast-feeding or thinking about breast-feeding,  you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.   
Breast-feeding is not recommended  in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.  
Driving and using machines 
Lopinavir/ritonavir has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or 
operate machines. Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) 
that impact your ability to do so safely. Instead, contact your doctor. 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
It is important that Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or 
crushed. Patients who have difficulty in swallowing the tablets, should should check for the availabity of 
more suitable formulations.  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure how you should take your medicine. 
How much Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan should be taken and when? 
Use in adults 
 −  
The usual adult dose is 400 mg/100 mg twice a day i.e. every 12 hours, in combination with other anti-
HIV medicines. Adult patients who have not previously taken other antiviral medicines can also take 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lopinavir/ritonavir tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose. Your doctor will advise on the 
number of tablets to be taken. Adult patients who have previously taken other antiviral medicines can 
take lopinavir/ritonavir tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose if their doctor decides it is 
appropriate.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir must not be taken once daily with efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital and phenytoin.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food. 
−  
−  
Use in children 
 −  
−  
For children, your doctor will decide the right dose (number of tablets) based on the child’s height and 
weight.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir is also supplied as 100 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets.  
If you or your child take more Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan than you should 
 −  
−  
If you realise you have taken more lopinavir/ritonavir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor 
right away.  
If you cannot contact your doctor, go to the hospital.  
If you or your child forget to take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
If you are taking lopinavir/ritonavir twice a day  
− 
− 
If you notice you miss a dose within 6 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed dose 
as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as prescribed 
by your doctor.  
If you notice you miss a dose by more than 6 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take 
the missed dose. Take the next dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose.  
If you are taking lopinavir/ritonavir once a day  
− 
−  
If you notice you miss a dose within 12 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed 
dose as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as 
prescribed by your doctor.  
If you notice you miss a dose by more than 12 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take 
the missed dose. Take the next dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose.  
If you or your child stop taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
−  
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Do not stop or change the daily dose of lopinavir/ritonavir without first consulting with your doctor.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir should always be taken every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter 
how much better you feel.  
Taking lopinavir/ritonavir as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the 
development of resistance to the product.  
If a side effect is preventing you from taking lopinavir/ritonavir as directed tell your doctor right away.  
Always keep enough lopinavir/ritonavir on hand so you don’t run out. When you travel or need to stay 
in the hospital make sure you will have enough lopinavir/ritonavir to last until you can get a new 
supply.  
Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, lopinavir/ritonavir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. It may be 
difficult to tell which side effects have been caused by lopinavir/ritonavir and which may occur due to other 
medicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the HIV infection. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This is 
partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines 
themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
The following side effects have been reported by patients who took this medicine. You should tell your 
doctor promptly about these or any other symptoms. If the condition persists or worsens, seek medical 
attention.

1.  What Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan is and what it is used for 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Your doctor has prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir to help to control your Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan. 
Important information  
−  
People taking lopinavir/ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
disease and AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while 
taking lopinavir/ritonavir.  
Tell your doctor if you or your child have/had  
−   Haemophilia type A and B as lopinavir/ritonavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  
−  
−  
Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  
A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or 
C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.  
Tell your doctor if you or your child experience 
−  
−  
−  
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in the legs 
and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels.  
Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels in the 
blood.  
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) 
have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and these symptoms 
may suggest this condition.  
In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and 
symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
−  
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.  
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement 
as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral 
therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression (reduction in the activity 
of the immune system), higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors 
for developing this disease.  
−   Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines. On rare 
−  
occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  
Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. 
These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).

Erectile dysfunction medicines (avanafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil)  
−  
−  
Do not take lopinavir/ritonavir if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil.  
You must not take lopinavir/ritonavir with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
section above).  
If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and lopinavir/ritonavir together, you may be at risk of side effects 
such as low blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours. 
If an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid permanent 
damage to your penis. Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. 
−  
Contraceptives  
−  
If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, 
you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as lopinavir/ritonavir 
may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
− 
−  
−  
Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.  
If you are breast-feeding or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.  
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.  
Driving and using machines 
Lopinavir/ritonavir has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or 
operate machines. Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) 
that impact your ability to do so safely. Instead, contact your doctor.

appropriate.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir must not be taken once daily with efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital and phenytoin.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food.

weight.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food.  
Lopinavir/ritonavir is also supplied as 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets. Other forms of this medicine may 
be more suitable for children; ask your doctor or pharmacist.

 −  
−  
If you realise you have taken more lopinavir/ritonavir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor 
right away.  
If you cannot contact your doctor, go to the hospital.  
If you or your child forget to take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
If you are taking lopinavir/ritonavir twice a day  
− 
−

as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as prescribed 
by your doctor.  
If you notice you miss a dose by more than 6 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take 
the missed dose. Take the next dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose.  
If you are taking lopinavir/ritonavir once a day  
− 
−  
If you notice you miss a dose within 12 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed 
dose as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as

forgotten dose.  
If you or your child stop taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
−  
− 
− 
−

Lopinavir/ritonavir should always be taken every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter 
how much better you feel.  
Taking lopinavir/ritonavir as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the 
development of resistance to the product.  
If a side effect is preventing you from taking lopinavir/ritonavir as directed tell your doctor right away.  
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
− 
Always keep enough lopinavir/ritonavir on hand so you don’t run out. When you travel or need to stay 
in the hospital make sure you will have enough lopinavir/ritonavir to last until you can get a new 
supply.  
Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, lopinavir/ritonavir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. It may be 
difficult to tell which side effects have been caused by lopinavir/ritonavir and which may occur due to other 
medicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the HIV infection. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This is 
partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines 
themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
The following side effects have been reported by patients who took this medicine. You should tell your 
doctor promptly about these or any other symptoms. If the condition persists or worsens, seek medical 
attention.

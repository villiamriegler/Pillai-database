Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Prezista 
darunavir 
On 25 July 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Prezista (darunavir). The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-
Cilag International N.V. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they 
notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the 
opinion. 
The CHMP adopted an extension of the indication for use of darunavir/ritonavir once daily regimen in 
paediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms who are antiretroviral 
treatment naïve or with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir RAMs 
and who have plasma HIV 1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Prezista will be as follows2: 
100 mg/ml oral suspension  
Prezista, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult and 
paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight (see section 4.2). 
In deciding to initiate treatment with Prezista co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of 
mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and 
treatment history should guide the use of Prezista. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

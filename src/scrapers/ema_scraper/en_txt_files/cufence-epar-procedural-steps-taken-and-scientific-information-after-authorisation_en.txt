are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

mg trientine capsule and to assess the effect of dissolution 
rate and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 
trientine. The data showed that trientinie is absorbed with 
tmax occurring between 0.5 and 6 hours post-dose and the 
variation between subjects is of up to 60%. The intake of 
food within 30 minutes prior to trientine administration 
delayed the time to peak concentrations by 2 hours and 
reduces the extent of absorption of trientine by 
approximately 45%. 
The data further indicated that the plasma exposure to the

MAT metabolite is approximately 3 times that of unchanged 
trientine, while exposure to the DAT metabolite is slightly 
lower compared to trientine. The metabolites of trientine 
have Cu-chelating properties, however the stability of these 
Cu-complexes is low due to the introduction of the acetyl 
groups. The contribution of chelating activity by the MAT 
and DAT metabolites appeared to be limited. After 
absorption trientine and its metabolites are rapidly excreted 
in the urine, either bound to copper or unbound. The 
unabsorbed fraction of orally administered trientine is 
bound to intestinal copper and eliminated through faecal 
excretion. 
The elimination half-life of trientine is approximately 4 
hours (mean t1/2 of 3.8 ± 1.3 hours measured at steady 
state in WD patients and 4.4 ± 4.7 hours measured after a 
single dose in healthy volunteers). The elimination half-
lives of the two metabolites were 14.1 ± 3.7 hours for MAT 
and 8.5 ± 3.0 hours for DAT after a single dose 
administration of trientine in healthy subjects. The data 
from healthy subjects indicate that age, gender and body 
weight do not seem to influence the pharmacokinetics of 
trientine. Based on quality data the information on storage 
of the medicinal product was updated in the product 
information to reflect that no special storage condition is 
needed when unopened. After opening the bottle should be 
stored in a refrigerator (2ºC 8ºC).

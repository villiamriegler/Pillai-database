2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Xultophy is a combination of insulin degludec (basal insulin) and liraglutide (a GLP-1 agonist). It is currently 
approved for the treatment of adults with T2DM to improve glycaemic control in combination with oral 
glucose-lowering medicinal products, when these alone or combined with basal insulin do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
This variation application was submitted to extend the indication for Xultophy to include transfer of patients 
from Glucagon-Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) treatment to Xultophy. The application is based 
on trial NN9068-3851, which investigated the efficiency and safety of Xultophy versus unchanged GLP-1 RA 
therapy in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RA therapy in combination 
with metformin +/- pioglitazone +/- sulphonylurea (SU). The product Information and the Risk Management 
Plan has been updated with editorial changes and based on the results from trial NN9068-3851.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Xultophy (IDegLira) consists of two drug substances, insulin degludec and liraglutide, which are 
characterised as peptides. CHMP therefore considered it exempted from the requirement to perform an 
environmental risk assessment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Xultophy (IDegLira) is a combination of the long-acting basal insulin insulin degludec (IDeg, active 
substance of Tresiba) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide (active substance of 
Victoza). IDegLira thus combines the active substances of two approved products that within their 
respective drug classes have shown desirable characteristics in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM):  
• 
• 
IDeg has a duration of action beyond 42 hours at clinically relevant doses, resulting in a flat and stable 
pharmacodynamic action profile and low day-to-day variability in glucose lowering effect. 
Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion in a glucose dependent manner 
when plasma glucose levels are above normal and shows an effect on reducing body weight through 
mechanisms involving decreased hunger and lowered energy intake. 
The complementary modes of action of these two compounds have been demonstrated to provide clinically 
relevant improvements in glycaemic control at a low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain in patients with 
T2DM when compared to insulin. In addition, IDegLira provides a treatment benefit to patients in terms of 
convenience by enabling the administration of both IDeg and liraglutide in one single injection. 
IDegLira is initiated and titrated according to glycaemic control (fasting plasma glucose levels) as is current 
practice for basal insulin therapy. The combination product is provided in a pre-filled pen containing an 
IDeg/liraglutide ratio of 100 units/3.6 mg per mL. The pre-filled pen allows for dose adjustment in dose 
steps, with one dose step containing 1 unit of IDeg and 0.036 mg of liraglutide. 
The dose range of the pre-filled pen is from 1 to 50 dose steps, with 50 dose steps corresponding to 50 units 
of IDeg and 1.8 mg of liraglutide. 
Rationale for variation application 
IDegLira is currently approved under the trade name Xultophy for the treatment of adults with T2DM to 
improve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone 
or combined with basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Given the progressive nature of T2DM, current anti-diabetic therapies, including treatment with GLP-1 
receptor agonist (RA) (e.g., liraglutide and exenatide), often do not provide sustained glycaemic control, 
and insulin treatment is eventually indicated for many patients with T2DM. Accordingly, the addition of 
insulin therapy in T2DM patients inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RA treatment is consistent with current 
treatment guidelines. 
This variation application was submitted to extend the indication for IDegLira to include transfer of patients 
from GLP-1 RA treatment to IDegLira. The application is based on Trial NN9068-3851 (in the following 
referred to as Trial 3851), which investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira versus unchanged GLP-1 RA 
therapy in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RA therapy in combination

with metformin ± pioglitazone ± sulphonylurea (SU). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
• 
overview of clinical studies  
The application is based on the single pivotal trial NN9068-3851 (in the following referred to as Trial 3851). 
2.3.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies were submitted, which CHMP considered acceptable for this extension 
of indication application. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study (trial NN9068-3851) 
Methods 
Trial design 
Trial 3851 was a 26-week, multi-centre, multinational, open-label, 2-arm parallel, randomised, 
treat-to-target trial in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on a maximum tolerated 
dose or maximum dose according to local label of GLP-1 RA (Victoza [liraglutide] or Byetta [exenatide]) and 
metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU. Inadequately controlled T2DM was defined as an HbA1c level of 7.0–9.0%, 
both inclusive. The trial design is shown in Figure 1.  
Figure 1 Trial design – Trial 3851 
GLP-1: glucagon-like peptide-1; OD: once daily; SU: sulphonylurea 
Study participants 
The subject population was chosen to represent patients with T2DM inadequately controlled (HbA1c ≥7%) 
on current therapy of GLP-1 RA and who are expected to benefit from intensified treatment. Paediatric or 
adolescent subjects (<18 years of age) were not enrolled in the trial, whereas subjects above 65 years were

included. Subjects with significant concomitant illnesses were excluded from the trial. Significant 
concomitant illnesses included: personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 2, acute cardiovascular disease, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring 
treatment, clinically significant active (during the past 12 months) disease of the gastrointestinal, 
pulmonary, endocrinological (except for T2DM), neurological, genitourinary or haematological system and 
history of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis. The key inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
shown in Table 1.   
Table 1 Key inclusion and exclusion criteria – Trial 3851 
Withdrawal criteria 
Subjects could choose to withdraw from the trial at any time or could be withdrawn at the discretion of the 
investigator due to safety concerns or if judged non-compliant with trial procedures. The key withdrawal 
criteria were set to ensure subject safety and to ensure that subjects were not exposed to ineffective therapy 
for an unacceptable period of time (Table 2). 
Table 2  Key withdrawal criteria – Trial 3851 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to IDegLira or to continue their pre-trial GLP-1 RA therapy, both in combination 
with pre-trial doses of metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU.  
Xultophy 
Assessment report

Page 8/38 
 
  
 
 
The starting dose of IDegLira was 16 dose steps (16 units IDeg/0.6 mg liraglutide) followed by a 
treat-to-target approach with adjustment of doses to achieve the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target of 
4.0−5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL). The IDegLira dose was titrated twice weekly based on the mean of the 
three preceding fasting (pre-breakfast) self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values obtained prior to dose 
adjustment. The maximum dose of IDegLira was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide). 
For subjects in the GLP-1 RA arm, the pre-trial GLP-1 RA dose was to be continued. 
Both arms continued with pre-trial doses of metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU unless there was a safety 
concern (see Table 1). 
Choice of comparator 
The reason for continuing unchanged pre-trial GLP-1 RA therapy in the arm not receiving IDegLira was to 
enable an evaluation of the distinct efficacy and safety associated with transfer of therapy from GLP-1 RA 
treatment to IDegLira in subjects in need of intensification. 
Trial objectives 
The primary objective of Trial 3851 was to confirm superiority of IDegLira versus unchanged GLP-1 RA 
therapy in controlling glycaemia in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on GLP-1 RA 
therapy in combination with metformin ± pioglitazone ± sulphonylurea (SU). 
The secondary objective was to compare general efficacy and safety of IDegLira versus unchanged GLP-1 RA 
therapy. This was done by assessment of various endpoints related to efficacy and safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks of treatment 
Secondary endpoints 
The following secondary endpoints were investigated: 
•  Responders for HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment 
o  proportions of subjects achieving the target of HbA1c <7.0%  
o  proportions of subjects achieving the target of HbA1c ≤6.5% 
•  Withdrawal due to ineffective therapy, defined as subjects withdrawing due to withdrawal criterion 
number 3 (fasting SMPG values taken on three consecutive days or any of the FPG samples exceeding 
the limits defined in Table 2). 
•  Change from baseline after 26 weeks in fasting plasma glucose 
•  Change from baseline after 26 weeks in SMPG – 9 point profile 
o  Mean of the 9-point profile, defined as the area under the profile (calculated using the 
trapezoidal method) divided by the measurement time. 
o  Postprandial plasma glucose increments (from before meal to 90 min after for breakfast, lunch 
and dinner). The mean increment over all meals was derived as the mean of all available meal 
increments. 
•  Change from baseline after 26 weeks in body weight

Sample size 
The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority in the primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from 
baseline after 26 weeks of treatment) for IDegLira versus continued GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy. 
The sample size was calculated using a two-sided t-test of 5%. Furthermore, the mean difference in the 
primary endpoint between IDegLira and continued GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy was assumed to be 0.4% 
with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.2%. From these assumptions the sample size was set to a total of 429 
subjects, which is 286 in the IDegLira treatment group and 143 in the unchanged GLP-1 receptor agonist 
group, in order to obtain a power of 90% of meeting the primary objective. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive IDegLira or to continue their unchanged GLP-1 
RA pre-trial medication. The randomisation was stratified according to prior type of GLP-1 RA, i.e., Victoza 
(liraglutide) or Byetta (exenatide). Both arms continued pre-trial doses of metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU. 
An open-label design was chosen. It was not deemed feasible to include a placebo, as this would require a 
double dummy approach with two daily injections and would also restrict the GLP-1 RA studied in the trial to 
either liraglutide or exenatide (requiring a transfer of one of the pre-treatment GLP-1 RAs to the GLP-1 RA 
chosen to be administered masked in the control arm). 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were defined in accordance with ICH E9:5 
• 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) – included all randomised subjects. In exceptional cases, subjects could be 
eliminated from the FAS. In such cases the elimination was justified and documented. The statistical 
evaluation of the FAS followed the intention-to-treat principle, and subjects contributed to the 
evaluation ‘as randomised’. 
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set – included all subjects in the FAS who fulfilled the following criteria: 
o  had not violated any inclusion criteria 
o  had not fulfilled any exclusion criteria 
o  had a non-missing HbA1c measurement at screening and/or randomisation 
o  had at least 12 actual treatment weeks of exposure 
o  had at least one non-missing HbA1c measurement after 12 actual weeks of exposure 
Xultophy 
Assessment report  
EMA/403340/2015 
Page 10/38 
 
  
Subjects in the PP analysis set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”. 
•  Safety analysis set (SAS) – included all subjects receiving at least one dose of the trial product. 
Subjects in the safety analysis set contributed to the evaluation ‘as treated’. 
•  Completer analysis set (CAS) – included all randomised subjects who completed the trial. 
Subjects in the CAS contributed to the evaluation ‘as randomised’. 
Descriptive statistics of all efficacy endpoints were based on the FAS. The robustness of the results for the 
primary endpoint was explored by sensitivity analyses including analysis on PP analysis set and CAS. 
Missing data 
Missing values (including intermittent missing values) were imputed using the last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) method. The sensitivity of the results of the primary analysis to this method was addressed 
by also applying mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) for handling missing data. 
Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification were put to lower limit of quantification/2. 
Statistical analyses 
Change from baseline of continuous endpoints (for example HbA1c, FPG, 9-point SMPG, body weight and 
PRO endpoints) were analysed using an analysis of covariance model with treatment, pre-trial GLP-1 RA 
(Victoza or Byetta) and region as fixed factors and the relevant baseline value as covariate. 
Log-transformation was applied for a number of pre-specified endpoints. The analysis results were 
back-transformed and presented on the original scale. 
The two responder endpoints (HbA1c <7.0% and ≤6.5%) were analysed using a logistic regression model 
with treatment, pre-trial GLP-1 RA (Victoza or Byetta) and region as fixed factors and baseline HbA1c value 
as covariate. 
Number of treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic episodes was analysed using a negative binomial regression 
model with a log-link function and the logarithm of the time period in which a hypoglycaemic episode was 
considered treatment-emergent as offset. The model included treatment, pre-trial GLP-1 (Victoza and 
Byetta) and region as fixed factors.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition is shown in Table 3. A total of 704 subjects were screened, of which 266 subjects failed 
screening. The majority of screening failures (74.1%) was due to failure to meet inclusion criteria no. 4 
(HbA1c 7.0–9.0% both inclusive).  
A total of 10.3% of the subjects withdrew during the trial, but with a lower proportion of withdrawn subjects 
in the IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 RA group. The proportion of subjects that completed the study 
was 94.5% in the IDegLira group and 80.1% in the GLP-1 RA group. The pattern of withdrawal was different 
between the two treatment groups; the primary reason for withdrawal in the IDegLira group was 
non-compliance with protocol (9 of 16 subjects), whereas in the GLP-1 RA group the primary reason was 
ineffective therapy (11 of 29 subjects). Three withdrawals were due to adverse events (1 subject in the 
IDegLira group and 2 subjects in the GLP-1 RA group).

Recruitment 
The trial was conducted at 81 sites in 5 countries as follows: Australia: 5 sites; France: 7 sites; Hungary: 4 
sites; Slovakia 6 sites; United States: 59 sites. 
The study was initiated on 29 August 2012 and completed on 11 March 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 7 substantial amendments to the protocol, none of these are considered to have implications for 
the interpretation of the study data. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 518 important PDs were reported for this trial. There was reported 1 PD at trial level, 1 PD at 
country level, 109 PDs at site level and 407 PDs at subject level. The majority of the PDs were related to the 
informed consent form (date field missing on all central ICFs in the US) and to assessments during the trial. 
None of the PDs had a major impact on the conduct of the trial, the safety of the subjects or the results of 
the analyses. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and diabetes characteristics 
The two treatment groups were comparable with respect to baseline characteristics (Table 4). The mean age 
was 58.3 years, and the gender distribution was even.

Table 4  Demographic characteristics at baseline – Trial 3851 
Baseline characteristics related to disease status were comparable for the two treatment groups (Table 5). 
Diabetic complications included nephropathy (7.5%), neuropathy (24.4%), macro-angiopathy (7.3%) and 
retinopathy (9.8%), with the proportion of subjects with nephropathy and macro-angiopathy being slightly 
higher in the IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 RA group (nephropathy: 9.2% versus 4.1%; 
macro-angiopathy: 8.9% versus 4.1%). Overall, the occurrence of diabetes-related complications was as 
expected for the patient population.

Table 5 Key baseline characteristics – Trial 3851 
Consistent with the subject inclusion criteria, all subjects were on metformin therapy at screening, with 
21.2% of subjects receiving SU concomitantly, 2.5% of subjects receiving pioglitazone concomitantly and 
2.1% of subjects receiving both SU and pioglitazone concomitantly. The distribution was similar for the two 
treatment groups. No clinically relevant differences in oral anti-diabetic treatment at screening were seen 
between the two treatment groups (Table 6). 
Table 6 Daily oral anti-diabetic treatment doses (mg) at screening – Trial 3851 
The subjects were stratified with respect to prior type of GLP-1 receptor agonist (79.5% liraglutide and 
20.5% exenatide in each treatment group). Mean daily dose of liraglutide at screening was 1.7 mg in both 
treatment groups. Mean daily dose of exenatide at screening was close to 18.5 ìg in both treatment groups. 
The required minimum dose of liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) and exenatide (10 ìg/day) was met for all subjects; 
Xultophy 
Assessment report

Page 14/38 
 
  
 
 
however, 2 subjects had their dose of liraglutide and exenatide incorrectly reported in the database as 6 
mg/day and 5 ìg/day, respectively. 
In general, the pattern of concomitant illnesses was representative for a population with T2DM. The most 
frequent disorders included ‘hypertension’ (79.5%) and ‘hyperlipidaemia’ (38.8%). There was a tendency 
towards a larger proportion of subjects in the IDegLira group reporting concomitant illnesses at screening 
compared to subjects in the GLP-1 RA group.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks of treatment (primary endpoint) 
Mean HbA1c levels throughout the duration of the trial are depicted by treatment group in Figure 2. Mean 
HbA1c at baseline was 7.8% in the IDegLira group and 7.7% in the GLP-1 RA group. After 26 weeks of 
treatment, HbA1c had on average decreased by 1.3%-points to 6.4% in the IDegLira group and by 
0.3%-points to 7.4% in the GLP-1 RA group. The reduction in HbA1c occurred primarily during the initial 3 
months of treatment in both treatment groups.

FAS; LOCF imputed data 
Error bars: +- standard error (mean) 
FAS: Full analysis set, LOCF: Last observation carried forward 
The reduction in HbA1c was statistically significantly greater with IDegLira compared to GLP-1 RA (estimated 
treatment difference: -0.94 [-1.11; -0.78]95% CI; p<0.001), confirming superiority of IDegLira over 
unchanged GLP-1 RA therapy. The robustness of the primary analysis was confirmed by 3 sensitivity 
analyses, all of which showed high similarity to the primary analysis. 
Secondary endpoints 
Responders for HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment 
The proportion of subjects reaching the pre-defined HbA1c targets at the end of the 26-week treatment 
period was consistently greater with IDegLira than with GLP-1 RA. The ADA target of HbA1c <7.0% was 
reached by 75.3% of subjects receiving IDegLira versus 35.6% of subjects receiving GLP-1 RA. Similarly, 
the proportion of subjects reaching the IDF target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was 63.0% with IDegLira versus 22.6% 
with GLP-1 RA (Table 7).

Table 7 HbA1c target responders after 26 weeks of treatment – Trial 3851 – full 
analysis set  
Logistic regression analysis showed that the estimated odds of achieving these HbA1c targets after 26 weeks 
of treatment were statistically significantly greater for subjects in the IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 
RA group. Estimated treatment difference of target responders to HbA1c <7.0% was 6.84 [4.28; 10.94]95% 
CI; p<0.001 and estimated treatment difference of target responders to HbA1c ≤6.5% was 7.53 [4.58; 
12.38]95% CI; p<0.001. 
Withdrawal due to ineffective therapy 
A total of 13 subjects were withdrawn due to ineffective therapy; 2 subjects in the IDegLira group and 11 
subjects in the GLP-1 RA group. The odds ratio for withdrawal was statistically significantly lower for subjects 
treated with IDegLira compared to subjects treated with GLP-1 RA; odds ratio for IDegLira vs. GLP-1 RA was 
0.08 [0.02; 0.38]95% CI; p=0.001. 
Change from baseline after 26 weeks in fasting plasma glucose 
Mean FPG levels throughout the duration of the trial are depicted by treatment group in Figure 3. Baseline 
FPG was 9.0 mmol/L (161.7 mg/dL) in the IDegLira group and 9.4 mmol/L (169.1 mg/dL) in the GLP-1 RA 
group. After 26 weeks of treatment, FPG had decreased by 3.0 mmol/L (53.6 mg/dL) to 6.0 mmol/L (108.5 
mg/dL) in the IDegLira group and by 0.6 mmol/L (10.7 mg/dL) to 8.8 mmol/L (158.4 mg/dL) in the GLP-1 
RA group. The greatest change in FPG occurred during the initial month of treatment in both treatment 
groups, and FPG had stabilised after approximately 8 weeks of treatment in both treatment groups (Figure 
3).

Change from baseline after 26 weeks in SMPG – 9 point profile 
Mean 9-point plasma glucose profile 
The 9-point SMPG profiles at baseline and after 26 weeks treatment are plotted in Figure 4. At baseline, the 
9-point SMPG profiles appeared similar between treatments groups. After 26 weeks of treatment, plasma 
glucose concentrations had decreased for both treatments, however, the profile for the IDegLira group 
showed lower glucose concentrations compared to the GLP-1 RA group at all 9 time points.

Prandial plasma glucose increments 
The mean prandial increment across all meals was 2.1 mmol/L (37.0 mg/dL) in the IDegLira group and 1.9 
mmol/L (34.3 mg/dL) in the GLP-1 RA group after 26 weeks of treatment. Consistent with the fact that both 
treatment groups received GLP-1 RA, there were no statistically significant differences in change from 
baseline in prandial increment between IDegLira and GLP-1 RA. 
Change from baseline after 26 weeks in body weight and waist circumference 
Mean body weight throughout the duration of the trial is depicted by treatment group in Figure 3–4. Mean 
body weight at baseline was 95.6 kg in the IDegLira group and 95.5 kg in the GLP-1 RA group. After 26 
weeks of treatment, mean body weight had increased by 2.0 kg with IDegLira and decreased by 0.8 kg with 
GLP-1 RA. 
Figure 5 Body weight by treatment week – Trial 3851 – full analysis set

The estimated treatment difference between IDegLira and GLP-1 RA of 2.89 kg [2.17; 3.62]95% CI was 
statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Waist circumference after 26 weeks of treatment was statistically higher in the IDegLira group compared to 
the GLP-1 RA group (estimated treatment difference: 2.14 cm [1.04; 3.25]95% CI, p<0.001). 
Change from baseline after 26 weeks in blood pressure 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline were similar for the two treatment groups, and there 
was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups after 26 weeks of treatment.  
Diabetes-related assessments 
Fasting insulin and fasting C-peptide after 26 weeks of treatment were statistically significantly lower in the 
IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 RA group, whereas no statistically significant difference was 
observed for fasting glucagon.  
Fasting lipid profile 
Total cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and apolipoprotein B after 26 weeks of 
treatment were statistically significantly lower in the IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 RA group. No

statistically significant differences were observed for HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein 
A-1. 
Change from baseline after 26 weeks in patient-reported outcomes based on TRIM-D and DTSQs 
Treatment related impact measure for diabetes 
A higher score on the 1–5 point TRIM-D scale indicates a better health state (less negative impact). In both 
treatment groups, all sub-domain scores and total score increased throughout the trial, but the increase was 
more pronounced with IDegLira than with unchanged GLP-1 RA therapy. 
After 26 weeks of treatment, the total score was statistically significantly higher for subjects in the IDegLira 
group compared to subjects in the GLP-1 RA group; estimated treatment difference was 5.0 units [2.9; 
7.2]95% CI, p<0.001. Similarly, all sub-domains were statistically significantly higher for subjects in the 
IDegLira group compared to subjects in the GLP-1 RA group. 
Diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire 
After 26 weeks of treatment, the treatment satisfaction scale total was statistically significantly higher for 
subjects in the IDegLira group compared to subjects in the GLP-1 RA group; estimated treatment difference 
was 2.0 units [1.1; 2.8]95% CI, p<0.001. ‘Hypoglycaemia’ was scored statistically significantly higher by 
subjects in the IDegLira group compared to subjects in the GLP-1 RA group indicating that these events are 
perceived as occurring more frequently, whereas ‘hyperglycaemia’ was scored statistically significantly 
lower. 
Comparison of results in sub-populations 
The efficacy of IDegLira in sub-populations was assessed through statistical analysis by testing the 
null-hypothesis of equal treatment effect on HbA1c reduction after 26 weeks of treatment across the 
different sub-groups (age, diabetes duration, baseline HbA1c and oral anti-diabetic treatment) when 
comparing IDegLira vs. unchanged GLP-1 RA therapy. No statistically significant differences between 
estimated treatment effects across the sub-populations were observed. 
Analysis of dose results 
The starting dose of IDegLira was 16 dose steps (corresponding to 16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg 
liraglutide) followed by individual dose adjustments. This amount of liraglutide is similar to the 
recommended starting dose of 0.6 mg/day with Victoza. Transferring subjects from GLP-1 RA therapy to 
IDegLira was not associated with any deterioration in glycaemic control when using a starting dose of 16 
dose steps and the pre-defined titration algorithm. This is illustrated in the plot of mean fasting plasma 
glucose levels in Figure 3.  
Furthermore, an endpoint specifically assessed withdrawal due to ineffective therapy, defined as withdrawal 
due to withdrawal criteria no. 3 (continuous high SMPG values). Withdrawals due to ineffective therapy are 
summarised by treatment week in Table 8. Only 2 subjects in the IDegLira group were withdrawn due to 
ineffective therapy (with both of the withdrawals occurring during the last 4 weeks of the 26-week treatment 
period). In comparison, 11 subjects in the GLP-1 RA group were withdrawn due to ineffective therapy.

Table 8 Withdrawal due to ineffective therapy – summary – Trial 3851 – full analysis 
set 
The maximum dose of IDegLira was 50 dose steps. This corresponds to 50 units IDeg and 1.8 mg liraglutide, 
thereby not exceeding the maximum approved daily dose of liraglutide (Victoza).The actual daily IDegLira 
dose by week is presented in Figure 6, showing that after 10–12 weeks of treatment, the increase in mean 
daily IDegLira dose levelled off around approximately 43 dose steps. Approximately 50% of subjects 
reached a daily IDegLira dose of 50 dose steps (Figure 6). The maximum dose was exceeded in 8 subjects, 
no corresponding AEs were reported. 
The mean HbA1c level was 6.5% in subjects who reached the maximum dose level of IDegLira. HbA1c after 
26 weeks of treatment was, however, slightly lower for subjects receiving a daily IDegLira dose <50 dose 
steps versus those reaching 50 dose steps (6.3% vs. 6.5%), but the difference was relatively small and the 
statistical analyses confirmed highly significant changes in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment for both 
dosing groups compared to unchanged GLP-1 RA therapy. Corresponding results for HbA1c responders 
showed the same pattern, confirming that a substantial proportion of subjects who received the maximum 
dose level of IDegLira were within targets for overall glycaemic control.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Trial 3851 was a 26-week, multi-centre, multinational, open-label, 2-arm parallel, randomised, 
treat-to-target trial in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on a maximum tolerated 
dose or maximum dose according to local label of GLP-1 RA (Victoza [liraglutide] or Byetta [exenatide]) and 
metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU. The overall design of the study, including the objectives and endpoints, is 
considered adequate. 
The reasons for choosing an open-label design is understood and accepted although it should be kept in mind 
that the fact that this could introduce bias both with regards to the efficacy and safety assessment. Patients 
randomised to their usual treatment, known by the patient to be insufficient, may be less prone to intensify 
their background treatment whereas patients on the new treatment may be more motivated for lifestyle 
changes. The awareness for adverse events could also be affected by the open-label design. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and reflect the proposed target population, although 
patients with a BMI>40 was not included. Patients with renal impairment (defined as serum-creatinine ≥133 
µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for males and ≥125 µmol/L (1.4 mg/dL), or hepatic impairment (defined as alanine 
aminotransferase (ALAT) ≥ 2.5 times upper normal range) were also excluded. Exclusion of patients with 
significant concomitant illnesses was made either due to known safety concerns related to the 
investigational product or in order to minimise drop-out due to (unrelated) worsening of the concomitant 
disease. This is acceptable. 
The choice of comparator is adequate considering the primary objective of the study which is to investigate 
the transfer from any GLP-1 RA to IDegLira. Liraglutide has been shown to exert a somewhat greater effect 
than exenatide (Buse et al, Lancet 2009), however, as patients were stratified with respect to pre-trial GLP-1 
RA therapy this would not affect the overall interpretation of the data. No long-acting GLP-1 RAs were 
available at the time of the initiation of the study. 
Withdrawal criteria, with regards to metabolic control, were specified which is of importance as patients in 
the control arm were to maintain their treatment in spite of inadequate metabolic control (HbA1c 
7.0-9.0 %). Withdrawal rates were low, but higher in the GLP-1 treated group. Few patients in each group 
withdrew due to adverse events.  
The study appears adequately conducted. One Slovakian site was inspected by the Slovakian authorities 
with no significant findings. The protocol deviations related to the informed consent forms were adequately 
handled. 
The subject population included in the study was representative of subjects with T2DM who were not 
adequately controlled on GLP-1 RA therapy and thus qualifying for intensified therapy. The treatment groups 
were balanced with regards to demographic characteristics. Although mean diabetes duration did not differ 
between groups, it appears that the patients in the IDegLira groups had a somewhat more severe disease 
with more diabetes complications and concomitant illnesses reported at baseline than in the GLP-1 group. 
The patients were stratified with respect to type of GLP-1 RA and the majority of patients were treated with 
liraglutide (79.5 %). The patients were adequately dosed with mean daily doses close to the maximal 
recommended dose for both liraglutide and exenatide and all patients were treated with at least liraglutide 
1.2 mg/day or exenatide 10 μg/day at inclusion. 
The study met its primary objective. The change in HbA1c was significantly greater in the IDegLira treated 
group compared to the group treated with GLP-1 RA (estimated treatment difference: -0.94 % [-1.11; 
-0.78]95% CI; p<0.001). It is noted that the HbA1c decreased on average by 0.3 % in the GLP-1 treated 
group in spite of the unchanged pharmacological treatment which is reassuring considering the open-label 
design of the study. It is also noted that the decrease in HbA1c was observed in the IDegLira treated group 
already after 4 weeks, thus it appears that the lower GLP-1 dose administered directly after the switch was 
Xultophy 
Assessment report

Page 21/38 
 
  
sufficiently compensated by the insulin component. Sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the 
results. 
The secondary endpoints support the outcome of the primary endpoint. Significantly more patients reached 
both the 7.0% (75 % vs 36%) and the 6.5% (63% vs 23%) HbA1c target in the IDegLira treated group 
compared to the GLP-1 treated group. Withdrawals due to ineffective therapy was reported in 2 patients in 
the IDeg Lira group and in 11 patients in the GLP-1 treated group. This difference was statistically 
significant. All withdrawals occurred after week 11 in the study. 
The FPG data support the primary endpoint. Switching from GLP-1 therapy to IDegLira did not change the 
overall pattern of the 9-point SMPG profile, thus prandial plasma glucose increments were not affected but 
the entire profile showed lower values after 26 weeks of treatment with IDegLira. 
As expected, the reduction of HbA1c through the addition of insulin therapy resulted in a mean body weight 
increase by 2.0 kg, with a concomitant increase in waist circumference.  
There were no differences observed with regards to blood pressure after 26 weeks of treatment. Fasting 
insulin and C-peptide decreased in the IDegLira treated group as could be expected when introducing insulin 
therapy. The changes in fasting lipid profile are in line with what is expected when metabolic glucose control 
is improved. 
Statistically significant improvements in PROs were observed both with the TRIM-D and DTSQ in favour of 
IDegLira treatment, although the data did reflect the higher occurrence of hypoglycaemia in this group. 
Considering the open-label design of the study, these data should be interpreted with caution. 
Subgroup analyses did not reveal any significant differences for the subgroups analysed. This is in line with 
previous data assessed with the original MAA. 
The proposed posology when transferring from a GLP-1 RA is a starting dose of 16 Xultophy dose steps 
(16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide). The data provided on FPG and HbA1c show that transfer 
from GLP-1 RA to IDegLira could be made at the recommended starting dose of 16 dose steps without any 
temporary loss in metabolic control. Thus the data support the proposed posology when switching from a 
short-acting GLP-1 RA. However, no data are available on subjects inadequately controlled on long-acting 
GLP-1 RAs, as no such medicinal products were available at the time of the initiation of the study. To address 
this issue, the applicant had provided during the procedure a conservative biomodelling analysis of a 
transfer from long-acting GLP-1 RA to IDegLira showing that patients are not expected to be subjected to a 
higher combined exposure and plasma concentration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist compared to the 
exposure prior to the transfer. In the SmPC section 4.2 wording has been added to consider the prolonged 
action of once weekly GLP-1 agonists when transferring patients from those products, which CHMP found to 
be adequate. 
Although the mean IDegLira dose at the end of study was 43 dose steps, about 50 % of patients reached the 
maximal dose. On the other hand, the doses at the end of the study ranged between 8 and 50 dose steps, 
indicating that some patients had a significant response to the combination, taking into account that all 
patients included were treated with at least liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or exenatide 10 μg/day.  
In  patients receiving 50 dose steps of Xultophy at end study, around 27% did not reach the HbA1c target of 
<7%, and 42% did not reach the HbA1c target of ≤6.5%. This issue is not however unique to the proposed 
new indication, the most comparable study is trial 3912 in the MAA, where subjects uncontrolled on oral 
agents and basal insulin were switched to Xultophy - the mean daily IDegLira dose at 26 weeks was 45 dose 
steps, with 65% reaching 50 dose steps. Clearly, in practice patients needing more than 50 dose steps per 
day can be switched to liraglutide and insulin degludec separately, and the liraglutide and/or insulin dose 
titrated further, but the number of subjects reaching the maximum number of dose steps demonstrates that 
it is not a suitable option for all patients. In patients uncontrolled on oral agents plus a GLP-1 agonist, before 
Xultophy 
Assessment report

switching to Xultophy the prescriber should consider if the patient is likely to require more insulin in the 
short-term than Xultophy can provide. Principally, this would be in overweight patients with insulin 
resistance, and in patients with marked hyperglycaemia.  
Xultophy provides a fixed dose ratio of liraglutide and insulin degludec, thus the doses of the separate 
components cannot be titrated separately. However, the submitted study shows a better proportion of 
patients reaching target in the IDegLira group, with only 1 case of severe hypoglycaemia in this arm. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the data show that patients failing on GLP-1 RA treatment may achieve benefits by transfer to 
IDegLira. Although the open-label design of the study as well as the choice of comparator may have 
introduced some bias, the data were considered robust by CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Methods 
The safety evaluation of this variation is based on data from study Trial NN9068-3851. For this evaluation 
the safety analysis set was used except for supporting statistical analyses (pertinent for pulse and 
hypoglycemia), which are based on the full analysis set. The two analysis sets are defined below: 
Safety analysis set (SAS): includes subjects receiving at least one dose of the investigational medicinal 
product or comparators. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation ‘as treated’ (N=436).  
Full analysis set (FAS): all randomized subjects in the trial. The statistical evaluation of the FAS followed 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects contributed to the evaluation “as randomised” (N=438). 
Adverse events 
All AEs described and discussed in this report are treatment-emergent, unless otherwise specified. A 
treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of 
exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day on randomised treatment.  
Hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded on specific hypoglycaemic episode forms including additional 
information in order to be able to classify the episodes according to prespecified criteria (See further Section 
0). In addition, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia during the trial were recorded as ‘medical events of 
special interest’ (MESI). Episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reviewed by a blinded, external reviewer 
(endocrinologist). 
Safety areas of interest were predefined based on the safety areas of interest known from the 
monocomponents. Events within these safety areas of interest were prespecified in the protocol as ‘medical 
events of special interest’ (MESI) as a tool to collect additional information to support the writing of 
comprehensive narratives for these events and a thorough evaluation of these safety areas. The evaluation 
included external adjudication of a subset of these events as specified in the table below (Table 9). 
Furthermore, the following additional categories were considered safety areas of interest based on class 
effects for one or both of the monocomponents or due to special interest for all investigational products: 
•  Gastrointestinal adverse events 
•  Injection site reactions

•  Hyperglycaemia 
•  Rare adverse events 
Table 9 AEs classified as medical events of special interest 
Exposure to the drug 
A total of 436 subjects were exposed to trial products (SAS); 291 subjects to IDegLira and 145 subjects to 
GLP-1 RA (liraglutide or exenatide), both added to metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU. The cumulative exposure 
in the IDegLira group and the GLP-1 RA group was 140.9 and 65.9 exposure years, respectively, consistent 
with the 2:1 randomisation ratio in the trial (Table 10). The majority of randomised subjects in both 
treatment groups (94.8% in the IDegLira group and 80.7% in the GLP- 1 RA group) were exposed for 25–28 
weeks. The lower proportion of subjects with an exposure of 25−28 weeks in the GLP-1 RA group compared 
to the IDegLira group was caused by a higher withdrawal rate throughout the trial period in the GLP-1 RA 
group.

Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
In Trial 3851, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs was 65.6% for IDegLira and 63.4% for GLP-1 RA. The 
rate per 100 PYE of AEs was 410.1 for IDegLira and 364.3 for GLP-1 RA (Table 11).

The most frequently reported AEs (> 5%) were ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘upper respiratory tract infection’, ‘lipase 
increased’, ‘headache’ and ‘diarrhoea’ (Table 12). The rate of ‘lipase increased’ was higher in the IDegLira 
group compared to the GLP-1 RA group (22.0 vs. 12.1 events per 100 PYE, respectively) and the rate of 
‘nasopharyngitis’ was lower in the IDegLira group compared to the GLP-1 RA group. For the remaining 
frequently reported events, no noticeable differences were observed between the two treatment groups 
(Table 12). 
Table 12 Adverse events by system organ class and preferred term most frequent 
(>=5%) - treatment emergent - summery - Trial 3851 – SAS 
Adverse events related to trial product 
The majority of AEs were considered unlikely related to trial product by the investigator. The overall rate of 
AEs per 100 PYE considered possibly or probably related to trial product by the investigator was higher with 
IDegLira (44.7 and 8.5, respectively) than with GLP-1 RA (13.7 and 4.6, respectively) (Table 11). 
At preferred term level, the most common AEs considered possibly or probably related to trial product were 
‘lipase increased’, ‘diarrhoea’, ‘nausea’ and ‘headache’. Of these, ‘lipase increased’, ‘diarrhoea’ and 
‘headache’ occurred more frequently in the IDegLira group than in the GLP-1 RA group. ‘Nausea” occurred 
more frequently in the GLP-1 RA group.  
Adverse events by severity 
The majority of the AEs in Trial 3851 were assessed as mild or moderate. Severe AEs were reported in 9 
(3.1%) and 3 (2.1%) of the subjects in the IDegLira and GLP-1 RA groups, respectively. In total 17 severe 
reactions were reported within these subjects. 
In the IDegLira group, the most common severe AE was ‘headache’ (4 events reported in 1 subject). The 
remaining severe AEs were single occurrences distributed across different SOCs. All severe AEs (n=17) 
except one (foot-fracture) had resolved or was resolving at end of study (Table 11).

Outcome of adverse events 
There was no overall difference between the treatment groups with respect to outcome of AEs. At end of 
trial, approximately 86% of all AEs (703 of 818 AEs) had the outcome of ‘recovered’ (81.2%), ‘recovering’ 
(4.5%) or ‘recovered with sequelae’ (0.2%) (Table 11). 
Serious adverse event and deaths  
Serious adverse events 
In total, there were 15 SAEs in Trial 3851; 12 in the IDegLira group (reported in 9 subjects) and 3 (reported 
in 3 subjects) in the GLP-1 RA group, corresponding to a rate of 8.5 and 4.6 events per 100 PYE. No 
clustering in type of SAEs was evident, and no SAEs were deemed possibly or probably related to trial 
product by the investigator. The overall number of the events was low, and therefore data should be 
interpreted with caution. Details of the individual SAEs are listed in Table 13 below. 
The outcome of the 15 SAEs was reported as recovered for 12 SAEs, recovered with sequelae for one patient, 
not recovered for one and unknown for one patient (Table 13).

Deaths 
There were no deaths reported in Trial 3851. 
Adverse events of special interest 
MAH considered that no clinically significant differences were observed between the IDegLira group and the 
GLP-1 RA group for the AEs of special interest including MESIs. MESIs are defined in Table 9 above.

Cardiovascular events 
Cardiovascular events (including arrhythmias) were reported at a higher rate in the IDegLira group 
compared to the GLP-1 group (26 events in 14 subjects in the IDegLira group and 3 events in 3 subjects in 
the GLP-1 group corresponding to event rates of 18.4 and 4.6 events per 100 PYE for the IDegLira and the 
GLP-1 group, respectively). In the IDegLira group 2 subjects reported 9 and 4 CV events, respectively. This 
can partly explain the difference observed between treatment groups. 
Two events (‘lacunar infarction’ and ‘transient ischaemic attack; both in the IDegLira group) were confirmed 
as cardiovascular events by the external adjudication committee (EAC) and both events were identified as 
MACE. 
Cardiac arrhythmia 
Cardiac arrhythmia was to be reported as MESI in this trial.  With the separate SMQ search made, 9 events 
potentially related to cardiac arrhythmia in 8 subjects were identified (2.1% in the IDegLira and 1.3% in the 
GLP 1 RA group); 7 events in the IDegLira group and 2 in the GLP-1 group. Except for ‘atrial fibrillation’, 
which was reported in 2 subjects (both in the IDegLira group), all events were single occurrences.  All events 
were non-serious except for one event of ‘atrial fibrillation’ reported as SAE. Of the 9 potential cardiac 
arrhythmia events, 8 were considered unlikely related to trial product; the remaining 1 event (‘sinus 
tachycardia’) reported in the IDegLira group was considered possibly related to trial product. 5 of the events 
had resolved at the end of trial and 4 events had not resolved, all in the IDegLira group. No subjects with AEs 
potentially related to cardiac arrhythmia had an abnormal, clinically significant ECG during the trial. 
Pancreatitis and thyroid events 
No events of pancreatitis were reported and no thyroid-related AEs were sent for adjudication. Based on 
continuous calcitonin monitoring no safety issues were observed. 
Neoplasms 
3 events were confirmed as neoplasms by the EAC; 2 events in the IDegLira group and 1 event in the GLP-1 
group. The rate of confirmed neoplasms was 1.4 and 1.5 events per 100 PYE in the IDegLira and GLP-1 
groups, respectively. Of the 3 confirmed neoplasms, 1 (‘lip squamous cell carcinoma’) was classified as 
malignant (IDegLira group). 
Allergic reactions 
The rate of allergic reactions was higher in the GLP-1 group compared to the IDegLira group (10.6 and 6.4 
and events per 100 PYE, respectively) (Table 14). All events were non-serious and considered unlikely 
related to the trial product except ‘drug hypersensitivity’ in the IDegLira group. This event was considered 
probably related to trial product and the subject was withdrawn from the trial.

Table 14 Allergic reaction (immunogenicity) by SOC and PT Treatment emergent - 
summery - SAS 
The rate of AEs related to injection site reactions in the IDegLira group and the GLP-1 group was 7.1 and 1.5 
events per 100 PYE, respectively. All injection site reactions were non-serious, mild in severity and had 
resolved by the end of the trial. The majority of the events were considered possible or probably related to 
trial product. 
Gastrointestinal events 
The proportion of subjects with GI AEs was similar between the two treatment groups (15.5% in the 
IDegLira group and 15.2% in the GLP-1 RA group). The corresponding rates were 44.7 (IDegLira) and 57.7 
events per 100 PYE, respectively in the IDegLira group and the GLP-1 group. All events were non-serious, 
and the majority of the events were mild.  The most frequent GI events are summarised in Table 15. The rate 
of diarrhoea was similar between treatment groups whereas the rates of “constipation” and “dyspepsia” 
were higher in the IDegLira group and “nausea” and “vomiting” were higher in the GLP-1RA group.

Hypoglycaemic episodes 
Methods  
Episodes of hypoglycaemia were self-reported based on the subjects’ self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) 
recordings, reflecting common clinical practice. 
In addition, subjects had to measure plasma glucose upon suspicion of hypoglycaemia. All plasma glucose 
values ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), as well as values > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) were recorded by the subjects 
in the diary, and the information was transferred to a separate form in the eCRF at the following site visit. 
Definitions  
Confirmed hypoglycemic episodes: a severe hypoglycaemic episodes (patient not able to self-treats; see 
below) or episodes of hypoglycaemia with plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), regardless of 
symptoms. 
Nocturnal hypoglyceamia: a hypoglycaemic episode with time of onset between 00:01 and 05:59 (both 
included). 
Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic episode: an episode with onset on or after the first day of exposure to 
randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day on randomised treatment. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes categorised according to the ADA criteria: definitions applying a plasma glucose 
cut-off level of 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 
Severe hypoglycaemic episode: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions. 
Results  
Confirmed hypoglycaemia 
The proportion of subjects who experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes in the IDegLira was 32% and 
in the GLP-1 group 2.8%. The corresponding rates were 281.7 and 12.1 episodes per 100 PYE, respectively. 
The estimated treatment ratio of IDegLira vs. GLP-1 was 25.36 [10.63; 60.51]95%CI, p<0.001, 
demonstrating a statistically significantly higher rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes with IDegLira 
compared to GLP-1 (see Table 16 and Figure 7 below). 
One episode of severe hypoglycaemia (non-serious) occurred during the trial. This occurred in a subject in 
the IDegLira group.

Hypoglycaemic episodes and SU use 
Hypoglycaemic episodes were displayed according to SU treated subjects vs. non-SU treated subjects in the 
IDegLira and GLP-1 RA groups. The rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was higher in SU-treated 
subjects compared to non-SU treated subjects in both treatment groups. In the IDegLira group, the rate per

100 PYE of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was 634.4 in the SU treated subjects (n=68) compared to 
174.8 in the non-SU treated subjects (n=223). In the GLP-1 group, the event rate per 100 PYE was 51.2 in 
SU treated subjects (n=34) and 0.0 in non-SU treated subjects (n=111) (Table 17).

emergent 
Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia 
The proportion of subjects experiencing nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were higher for 
IDegLira (32 subject; 11%) than for GLP-1 RA (one subject; 0.7%). The estimated treatment ratio of 
IDegLira vs. GLP-1 RA was 32.82 [4.13; 261.04]95%CI; p < 0.001. None of the nocturnal hypoglycaemic 
episodes were classified as serious or severe. 
Hypoglycaemic episodes (ADA classification) 
For hypoglycaemic episodes as classified according to the ADA criteria (see definition above), the relative 
differences between treatment groups were similar to those observed for confirmed (69% and 16%, 
respectively) and nocturnal confirmed (37% and 3.4%, respectively) hypoglycaemia. 
Discontinuation due to AES  
Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
A total of 3 subjects were withdrawn from Trial 3851 due to AEs: 1 subject (0.3%) in the IDegLira group with 
‘drug hypersensitivity’ (a severe and non-serious event considered probably related to trial product) and 2 
subjects in the GLP-1 RA group with ‘abdominal discomfort’ (a mild and non-serious event considered 
possibly related to trial product) and ‘foot fracture’ (a severe and serious event considered unlikely related 
to trial product), respectively. In addition, 1 subject in the IDegLira group was withdrawn due to other 
reasons. It was reported by the investigator that the subject skipped doses and then discontinued study drug 
due to hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction in investigational product 
In addition, three subjects had 3 AEs (‘diarrhoea’, ‘vomiting’ and ‘skin induration’) leading to dose reduction 
in the IDegLira group, whereas none was reported in the GLP-1 RA group. All three events were non-serious, 
and subjects recovered from the events.  
Adverse events leading to temporary withdrawal of trial product 
Xultophy 
Assessment report  
EMA/403340/2015 
Page 32/38 
 
  
 
 
Six subjects had 9 AEs leading to temporary withdrawal of trial product in the IDegLira group (“nausea”, 
“lacunar infarction”, “migraine”, “cholecystitis acute”, “cholelithiasis”, “wound infection”, “pituitary tumour”, 
“COPD” and “skin ulcer”), and 1 subject had 1 AE leading to temporary withdrawal of trial product in the 
GLP-1 group (vomiting). Four of the AEs were classified as serious. All AEs except one (nausea) were judged 
as unlikely related to study drug. 
Clinically laboratory evaluation 
Amylase 
An increase in amylase activity was observed for IDegLira (mean change at Week 26 was 6.2 units/L), and 
a decrease was seen in the GLP-1 RA group (mean change at Week 26 was -1.0 units/L). Correspondingly, 
the proportion of subjects of the IDegLira group with amylase values above the reference range increased 
during the trial with the highest proportion at Week 12. 
In the IDegLira group, the proportion of subjects that had a shift in amylase value within the reference range 
at screening to a value above reference range at end of trial was higher (7.6%) than the proportion of 
subjects (4.1%) that had a shift in the opposite direction (normalisation). In the GLP-1 RA group, the 
proportion of subjects that had abnormal amylase values did not appear to change significantly during the 
trial.  
Lipase 
A decrease in mean lipase activity during the trial was observed both in the IDegLira group (mean change at 
Week 26 was -1.0 units/L) and in the GLP-1 RA group (mean change at Week 26 was -1.8 units/L). The 
proportion of subjects that had abnormal lipase values did not appear to change significantly during the trial. 
Lipase values >3xUNR, irrespective of symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract, were to be reported as a 
MESIs. A total of 15 subjects (13 in the IDegLira group and 2 in the GLP-1 RA group) had post-baseline lipase 
values >3xUNR and reported as MESIs. For the majority of these subjects, the increase was a single 
occurrence.  
Of note, no subjects were withdrawn from the trial due to the withdrawal criterion related to suspicion of 
acute pancreatitis, and no subjects were withdrawn from the trial due to adverse events of increased lipase. 
Calcitonin 
Calcitonin was monitored as a biomarker of C-cell activity. A blood sample for calcitonin was drawn at 
screening, at randomization, and at Weeks 12 and 26. No clinically relevant differences were observed 
between the treatment groups in mean calcitonin levels during the trial.  
Any confirmed episode of a calcitonin value ≥ 20 ng/L was to be reported as a MESI. In four subjects (1 in 
IDegLira and three in GLP-1 RA groups respectively) non-serious events of blood calcitonin increased was 
reported.  
Other laboratory parameters (haematology, urinalysis and other biochemistry parameters) 
The MAH concludes that no clinically relevant changes in haematology or urinalysis were observed from 
baseline to end of treatment in any of the two treatment groups  
The proportion of subjects with abnormal biochemistry values did not either appears to change significantly 
during the trial or to differ between the treatment groups, except for sodium. However, the increased 
proportion of patients with a shift from normal to high levels of sodium in the IDegLira (from 7.6% to 14.1%) 
compared to no such change in the GLP-1RA (from 4.1%to 4.8%) was not considered as clinically significant. 
Vital signs evaluation 
Xultophy 
Assessment report  
EMA/403340/2015 
Page 33/38 
 
  
Pulse 
Pulse was measured at screening, at Weeks 12 and 26. At baseline there was no significant difference in 
pulse observed between the two groups. At Week 26 no increase in the pulse had occurred from baseline in 
any of the treatment groups (in IDegLira group the pulse was the same [77.2 beats/min] and in the GLP-1 
group a reduction by 1.7 beats/min had occurred [75.5 beats/min]). 
Other vital signs 
According to the MAH “physical examination”, ECG measurements and fundoscopy results did not 
demonstrated any clinically relevant changes between treatment groups.  
There was no pregnancy reported during the study period. 
Blood pressure is described in a previous section.  
Safety in special populations 
No clinically relevant differences or consistent patterns were observed for the overall distribution of adverse 
events or serious adverse events across age groups. However, it should be noted that subjects ≥75 years 
constituted a small sub-population of all trial subjects (n=9), and the results for this age subset should 
therefore be interpreted with caution. 
In addition, patients with impaired renal or impaired liver function were excluded in Trial 3851. Therefore no 
safety data within these subgroups could be presented. 
Post-marketing experience 
No post-marketing data for IDegLira are available. Periodic safety update reports will be provided according 
to ICH and EMA requirements. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In terms of safety, trial 3851 confirmed that IDegLira was generally well tolerated, with an adverse event 
profile reflecting previous experience from IDegLira clinical trials and the marketed mono-component 
products, IDeg and liraglutide. No clustering or unexpected patterns in the reported AEs and SAEs were 
observed, and IDegLira was not associated with any unexpected adverse reactions. The main safety finding 
is an expected difference in incidence and rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes in the patients with a 
switch to IDegLira compared to those with a continued use of GLP-1RA. However, the presented frequencies 
and rates are in accordance with previous studies.   
Besides “lipase increased” (higher among IDegLira subjects), there was no difference in frequency of the 
most common AEs of clinical interest between the two treatment groups. However, there was a larger 
difference in AEs pattern between the two groups when considering AEs judged as possibly or probably 
related to trial product. Of these, ‘lipase increased’, ‘diarrhoea’ and ‘headache’ occurred more frequently in 
the IDegLira group than in the GLP-1 RA group.  ‘Nausea” occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 RA group.  
No consistent differences in the reporting of gastrointestinal side effects were observed between the 
IDegLira and GLP-1 groups in this trial. The frequency of GI events was lower compare to previous studies. 
This is expected since all patients in the present study already have been treated with GLP-1 RA before the 
study start. 
In total, 4.8% in the IDegLira group and 3.9% in the GLP-1 RA group reported CV events including cardiac 
arrhythmic events. The difference observed between the two groups could possibly be explained by two 
Xultophy 
Assessment report  
EMA/403340/2015 
Page 34/38 
 
  
patients who experienced several reactions in the IDegLira group. The incidence of both CV events in general 
and cardiac arrhythmia specificity were low and in accordance with results in previous studies. 
Allergic reactions were more frequent in the group that continued to be treated with a GLP1 agonist (4.8%) 
than in those randomized to IDegLira (2.7%). The frequency in both groups was also higher than previously 
reported in other studies (0.9% for IDegLira and 1.8% for liraglutide group in pooled data from study 3697 
and 3912) . The discrepancy in the reporting rate for potential allergic/hypersensitivity reactions was linked 
to an expansion of the search criteria in trial 3851 compared to previous trials. Also, during the procedure, 
brief case reports for all the 15 events have been provided and all but one case were considered as unlikely 
related, thus alleviating any new safety concern. 
An increase of frequency and rate of hypoglycaemic episodes is expected when initiating insulin with the aim 
to achieve a better metabolic control and lower HbA1c. In accordance with the efficacy results, with lower 
HbA1c in the IDegLira group, the present study demonstrated a higher proportion of subject in the IDegLira 
group that experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared to the subjects in the GLP-1 RA group 
(32% versus 2.8%). The corresponding rates of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were also higher. Severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes were rare and occurred only once in one patient (IDegLira group). No serious or 
sever nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in any or the two treatment groups. 
Concomitant treatment of SU is known to increase the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. In the IDegLira group 
the incidence and rate of hypoglycaemic episodes were, as expected, higher in the SU treated group. The 
frequency and rate of hypoglycaemic episodes of both non-SU and SU treated subject respectively on 
IDegLira are in accordance with findings in previous studies   
In the present study there was a decrease in mean lipase activity during the trial observed both in the 
IDegLira group and in the GLP-1 RA group. Mean amylase was increased in the IDegLira group and 
decreased in the GLP-1 RA group. In previous studies both mean lipase and amylase have been increased in 
subjects that are treatment naïve to GLP-1 RA when initiating IDegLira. Since the increase of these 
biochemistry parameters are suggested to be driven by the use of GLP-1 RA it is logical that there has been 
an adaptation to this substance before study start, with further decrease during the study. The increase of 
lipase in 10% of the patients in the IDegLira group might reflect that the GLP-1 RA dose initially was lowered 
and later in the study increased.  
Other safety findings in this study were in accordance with findings in previous studies and relevant issues 
and reactions sufficiently covered in the SmPC and RMP.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In summary, the safety profile of IDegLira as add-on to GLP-1 RA treated, insulin naïve patients on OAD is 
in line with findings from previous studies.   
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan dated 24 November 2014 (Edition 2.0, version 1.0) is 
acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
No updates to the summary of safety concerns have been proposed by the MAH.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to 
include information on the transfer from GLP-1 RA to Xultophy. In addition, editorial changes have been 
made in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.1. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC: 
Section 4.1 
“Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control 
in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with a GLP-1 
receptor agonist or combined with basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1 for available data on the different combinations).” 
Section 4.2   
“Transfer from GLP-1 receptor agonist  
Therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists should be discontinued prior to initiation of Xultophy. When 
transferring from a GLP-1 receptor agonist, the recommended starting dose of Xultophy is 16 dose steps (16 
units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) (see section 5.1). The recommended starting dose should not 
be exceeded. If transferring from a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. once weekly dosing), the 
prolonged action should be considered. Treatment with Xultophy should be initiated at the moment the next 
dose of the long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist would have been taken. Close glucose monitoring is 
recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks.” 
Changes in the other Sections of the SmPC see Annex 1. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Xultophy (IDegLira) is a combination of insulin degludec (basal insulin) and liraglutide (GLP-1 agonist). It is 
currently approved for the treatment of adults with T2DM to improve glycaemic control in combination with 
oral glucose-lowering medicinal products, when these alone or combined with basal insulin do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. The combination device means that only 1 daily injection is required rather than 
2, and dose titration is simpler. 
The aim of the current procedure is to extend the indication for Xultophy to include the transfer of patients 
inadequately controlled on GLP-1 receptor agonists to Xultophy. The use of GLP-1 agonists in patients not 
controlled on metformin (+/- other oral agents) in T2DM is not a new concept: it is reflected in SmPCs for 
multiple other products, and is accepted in the current practice guidance.  Likewise, the addition of insulin in 
patients uncontrolled on GLP-1 agonists and ODAs is generally established.  The proposed indication is 
agreed to be rational from a pharmacological point of view and fits into the current paradigm for the 
treatment of T2DM. 
The application is supported by a single pivotal trial. Trial 3851 was a 26-week, multi-centre, multinational, 
open-label, 2-arm parallel, randomised, treat-to-target trial in insulin-naïve subjects with T2DM 
inadequately controlled on a maximum tolerated dose or maximum dose according to local label of GLP-1 RA 
(Victoza [liraglutide] or Byetta [exenatide]) and metformin ± pioglitazone ± SU. The primary objective of 
Trial 3851 was to confirm superiority of IDegLira versus unchanged GLP-1 RA therapy. The study was well 
designed, conducted and analysed.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The subject population included in the study was representative of subjects with T2DM who were not 
adequately controlled on GLP-1 RA therapy and thus qualifying for intensified therapy. The study met its 
primary objective. The change in HbA1c was significantly greater in the IDegLira treated group compared to 
the group treated with GLP-1 RA with an estimated treatment difference of -0.94 %([-1.11; -0.78]95 % CI; 
p<0.001). The HbA1c decreased on average with 0.3 % in the GLP-1 treated group in spite of the unchanged 
pharmacological treatment which is reassuring considering the open-label design of the study. It is noted 
that the decrease in HbA1c was observed in the IDegLira treated group already after 4 weeks, thus there was 
no indication of an initial loss of glycaemic control during the switch.   
The secondary endpoints support the outcome of the primary endpoint. Significantly more patients reached 
both the 7.0 % (75% vs 36%) and the 6.5 % (63% vs 23%) HbA1c target in the IDegLira treated group than 
in the GLP-1 treated group. Withdrawals due to ineffective therapy was reported in 2 patients in the IDeg 
Lira group and in 11 patients in the GLP-1 treated group. This difference was statistically significant. As 
expected, body weight increased with the addition of insulin therapy with a concomitant increase in waist 
circumference. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
CHMP acknowledged the reasons for choosing an open-label design, although it should be kept in mind that 
this could introduce bias both with regards to the efficacy and safety assessment, as patients aware of being 
randomised to a new treatment might behave and might be motivated differently as otherwise e.g. with 
regard to life style choices. 
The device does not provide adequate dosing for all patients. In the submitted pivotal trial around 50% of 
the subjects in the IDegLira group received the maximum dose 50 dose steps (50 units of insulin 
degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide). Whilst most patients at the top dose were effectively controlled, in patients 
receiving 50 dose steps of Xultophy at end study, around 27% did not reach the HbA1c target of <7%, and 
42% did not reach the HbA1c target of ≤6.5%. This demonstrates that (as with the existing indications) 
Xultophy is not a suitable option for all patients, and as always in T2DM, management must be 
individualised. 
The data support the proposed posology when switching from a short-acting GLP-1 RA. However, no data 
were available on subjects inadequately controlled on long-acting GLP-1 RAs, as no such medicinal products 
were available at the time of the initiation of the study. The MAH has provided modelled data supporting the 
switch from long-acting GLP-1 RAs based on the knowledge of the PK of these products. In the SmPC section 
4.2 wording has been added to consider the prolonged action of long-acting GLP-1 agonists when 
transferring patients from those products. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In terms of safety, trial 3851 confirmed that IDegLira was generally well tolerated, with an adverse event 
profile reflecting previous experience from IDegLira clinical trials and the marketed mono-component 
products, IDeg and liraglutide. No clustering or unexpected patterns in the reported AEs and SAEs were 
observed, and IDegLira was not associated with any unexpected adverse reactions. 
The main safety finding is an expected difference in incidence and rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
in the patients with a switch to IDegLira compared to those with a continued use of GLP-1RA. The proportion 
that experienced hypoglycaemic episode was 32% in the IDegLira group compared to 2.8% in those on 
continued use of GLP-1 RA. In both groups a higher rate of hypoglycaemia was observed in subjects on 
Xultophy

concomitant sulphonylurea (SU) treatment. The presented frequencies and rates are in line with the 
observations in previous studies. 
No consistent differences in the reporting of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were observed between the 
IDegLira and GLP-1 groups in this trial (approximately 15% in both groups). In general the frequencies of GI 
events were lower compared to observations in previous studies. This is expected since all patients in the 
present study already have been on GLP-1 RA before the study start. 
The incidence of allergic reactions was 2.7% and 4.8%in the IDegLira and GLP-1 RA group respectively. The 
frequency in both groups was higher than previously reported in other studies due to a change in search 
criteria between studies, thereby capturing more events in study 3851. The majority of events were 
unrelated to study treatment and no new safety concerns did arise from these data. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No new safety concerns did arise from the data presented. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
In conclusion, the data show that patients failing on GLP-1 RA treatment may achieve benefits by transfer to 
IDegLira. Although the open-label design of the study as well as the choice of comparator may have 
introduced some bias, the data were considered robust by CHMP. 
The safety profile of IDegLira as add-on to GLP-1 RA treated, insulin naïve patients on OAD is in line with 
findings from previous studies . All relevant safety issues are sufficiently covered in the SmPC and RMP. 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive in the proposed new indication. The newly submitted 
data do not adversely affect the benefit-risk balance of Xultophy, which remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
II 
a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one 
Extension of indication to include the transfer of patients from Glucagon-Like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor 
agonist (RA) treatment to Xultophy. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to include the assigned ATC-code in section 5.1 of the SmPC and to make minor editorial changes in the 
SmPC. The application included a revised RMP (edition 2.0, version 1.0). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

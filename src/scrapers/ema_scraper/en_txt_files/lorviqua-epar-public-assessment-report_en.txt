2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Although most patients with ALK-positive NSCLC derive substantial clinical benefit from crizotinib, 
some patients with ALK-positive NSCLC will not respond to treatment (intrinsic resistance), and other 
patients who initially experience clinical benefit will later develop resistance (acquired resistance). 
Next-generation ALK-TKIs such as ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib have been developed to address 
crizotinib treatment failure. However, ALK-positive NSCLC remains an incurable disease, as patients 
ultimately develop resistance to second-generation ALK-TKIs, including but not limited to emergence of 
brain metastases. Therefore, there is a need for additional ALK-TKIs, in patients whose disease has 
progressed on a second-generation ALK-TKI, which can overcome resistance mutations and with 
central nervous system (CNS) penetration. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lorviqua (lorlatinib) is intended as monotherapy for  the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive 
advanced  NSCLC  previously  treated  with  one  or  more  ALK  TKIs,  except  for  patients  treated  with 
crizotinib as the only ALK-TKI. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world (1.8 million new cases in 2012), 12.9% 
of all new cancers worldwide1. In Europe, the age standardised predicted mortality rate for lung cancer 
was 35.98 per 100,000 men and 14.24 per 100,000 women as of 2015. 
About  85%–90%  of  lung  cancers  are  constituted  by  NSCLCs,  and  ALK-positive  NSCLC  represents 
approximately  4%–5%  of  all  NSCLC  patients  in  both  Caucasian  and  Asian  populations,  which 
represents potentially 40,000 new cases worldwide each year. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features/Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ALK  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  encoded  on  chromosome  2  and  is  primarily  involved  in  developmental 
processes  and  expressed  at  low  levels  in  adults2.  The  first  genetic  rearrangement  of  ALK  seen  in 
NSCLC  involved  a  fusion  between  the  echinoderm  microtubule-associated  protein-like  4  (EML4)  gene 
and  the  ALK  tyrosine  kinase  domain.  EML4-ALK  has  the  capacity  to  transform  fibroblasts  grown  in 
culture  and  as  subcutaneous  xenografts  to  induce  tumour  formation3.  A  number  of  additional  ALK 
fusion  partners  have  been  described  in  NSCLC  that  are  believed  to  result  in  aberrant  signalling  and 
oncogenic  transformation4,5.  ALK  rearrangements  are  more  common  among  patients  with

and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS)6. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage 
Approximately, one third of the patients with Stage IIIA disease are considered operable. However, the 
majority  of  patients  with  Stage IIIA/B  have  inoperable  (unresectable)  disease,  and  are  amenable  to 
receiving  curative  intention  chemoradiation  treatment.  The  biological  characteristics  of  locally 
advanced,  Stage III  disease  are  poorly  defined;  the  clinical  characteristics  associated  with  prognosis 
are nodal station involvement, size of primary tumour, baseline pulmonary function, gender, presence 
or absence of significant weight loss, and performance status (PS). 
Pathological diagnosis based on tumour samples includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and cytogenetic analysis by fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation (FISH) test to detect ALK rearrangements. Molecular testing should be carried out to 
determine genetic alterations, such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements which determine 
choice of targeted treatment. 
2.1.5.  Management 
While the standard treatment algorithm for unselected NSCLC patients has historically involved front-
line  treatment  with  chemotherapy,  recent  clinical  studies  have  demonstrated  that  patients  with  ALK-
positive  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  respond  well  to  treatment  with  the  ALK  inhibitor 
crizotinib. 
The  approval  of  crizotinib  was  based  on  results  from  2  single-arm  studies7.  Crizotinib  is  a  first-
generation ALK-TKI is indicated for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (hereafter referred 
to  as  ALK-positive  NSCLC).  Crizotinib  significantly  prolonged  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  in 
previously untreated patients with ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC when compared with 
standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. 
Resistance due to the emergence of various ALK kinase domain mutations and the activation of bypass 
resistance  mechanisms,  continues  to  present  a  treatment  challenge  with  the  use  of  ALK-TKIs.  ALK 
resistant mutations following treatment with a second-generation ALK-TKI have also been observed in 
the  clinic.  Among  them,  ALKG1202R  and  ALKI1171T  missense  mutations  are  common  resistance 
mutations after ceritinib and alectinib treatment, respectively8. 
Among patients whose  disease  has progressed  on  second-generation  TKIs used either  in  the  first-  or 
second-line  setting,  chemotherapy  would  be  the  fall  back  standard  of  care.  Outcomes  with 
chemotherapy  have  been  modest.  In  a  randomised  Phase  3  trial  of  ceritinib  vs  chemotherapy 
(docetaxel or pemetrexed) in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had been previously treated with 
chemotherapy and crizotinib, chemotherapy had an objective response rate (ORR) of 6.9% and median 
PFS  of  1.6  months,  as  determined  by  blinded  independent  central  review  (ICR).  Chemotherapy  also 
has a limited intracranial (IC) ORR even in a treatment-naïve setting. In a randomised Phase 3 study 
of  first-line  ceritinib  versus  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  advanced  ALK-rearranged  NSCLC,  the

Unmet medical need 
Because there are no agents approved that confer substantial benefit for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC 
previously  treated  with  2  or  more  ALK-TKIs,  there  is  a  substantial  unmet  medical  need  in  this 
treatment setting. Of  note, this is a clinical situation that is similar to that  in patients whose  disease 
progressed  after treatment  with  a  second-generation  ALK-TKI  when  used  as  the  only  ALK-TKI.  Thus, 
additional drugs are needed to overcome resistance mechanisms, to impact patient outcomes through 
improved response rates and PFS, and to have significant antitumor activity against CNS metastases. 
Chemotherapy  would  provide  another  treatment  option  in  patients  whose  disease  progressed  after 
treatment with a second-generation ALK-TKI (either as the only ALK-TKI or when used after crizotinib). 
Because there are no published clinical data available on the antitumor activity of chemotherapy in this 
particular  setting,  the  best  approximation  for  the  efficacy  of  chemotherapy  would  be  patients 
previously treated with a platinum  doublet and  crizotinib. Data in this setting  have  been reported for 
the chemotherapy control arms of the alectinib Phase 3 ALUR trial and the ceritinib Phase 3 ASCEND-5 
trial.  In  the  ALUR  trial,  the  ORR  for  single-agent  chemotherapy  was  11.4%,  and  there  were  no  IC 
responses and median PFS was 1.4 months (95% CI not reported). In the ASCEND-5 trial, the ORR for 
single-agent  chemotherapy  was  6.9%  with  an  IC  ORR  of  5.0%  and  a  median  PFS  of  1.6  months 
(95%CI: 1.4, 2.8). 
About the product 
Lorlatinib is a selective, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of ALK and c-ros oncogene 
1 (ROS1) tyrosine kinases. 
In non-clinical studies, lorlatinib inhibited catalytic activities of non-mutated ALK and clinically relevant 
ALK mutant kinases in recombinant enzyme and cell-based assays. Lorlatinib demonstrated marked 
anti-tumour activity in mice bearing tumour xenografts that express echinoderm 
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) fusions with ALK variant 1 (v1), including ALK mutations 
L1196M, G1269A, G1202R, and I1171T. Two (2) of these ALK mutants, G1202R and I1171T, are 
known to confer resistance to alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib. Lorlatinib was also capable 
of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. Lorlatinib demonstrated activity in mice bearing orthotopic 
EML4-ALK or EML4-ALKL1196M brain tumour implants. The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Lorviqua as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with one or 
more ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), except for patients treated with crizotinib as the only ALK 
TKI.” 
The recommended indication for approval is:  
Lorlatinib as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed 
after: 
 
 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg lorlatinib taken orally once daily. 
Duration of treatment 
Assessment report

Treatment with lorlatinib is recommended as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from 
therapy without unacceptable toxicity. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If a dose of lorlatinib is missed, then it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers unless it is 
less than 4 hours before the next dose, in which case the patient should not take the missed dose. 
Patients should not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. 
Dose modifications 
Dosing interruption or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. 
Lorlatinib dose reduction levels are summarised below: 
 
First dose reduction: 75 mg taken orally once daily 
  Second dose reduction: 50 mg taken orally once daily 
Lorlatinib should be permanently discontinued if the patient is unable to tolerate the 50 mg dose taken 
orally once daily. 
Dose modification recommendations for toxicities and for patients who develop atrioventricular (AV)

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 14/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The applicant claims that in pivotal Study B7461001 (also called study 1001), lorlatinib demonstrated 
clinically meaningful benefit in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who previously received a range of 
treatments with prior ALK-TKIs and/or chemotherapy regimens, with tumour responses that were 
rapid, deep, and durable. 
Importantly, lorlatinib also had activity against brain metastases and exhibited antitumor activity 
across a variety of ALK kinase domain resistance mutations, including the difficult-to-treat 
G1202R/G1202del mutations. Lorlatinib also evoked responses in tumours resistant to prior ALK-TKIs 
that did not contain detectable ALK resistance mutations. 
Lorlatinib was generally tolerable, as AEs were primarily mild to moderate in severity and manageable 
by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as the rate of 
permanent treatment discontinuations associated with AEs was low without any treatment-related 
deaths. The safety profiles between the overall safety population and subgroups of baseline 
demographics (age, race, gender) were similar. 
 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The applicant claims that the confirmatory data will be provided with data from Study B7461006, an 
ongoing Phase 3, randomised, open-label trial of the safety and efficacy of lorlatinib and crizotinib for 
first-line treatment of subjects with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Study B7461006 is a global study 
with total of 280 subjects planned for enrolment. The First Patient First Dose was in May 2017, study 
enrolment is on schedule and planned to be completed by 4Q2018 with  clinical study report expected 
by 31 December 2021. 
 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed 
The applicant claims that the clinical benefit of lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC 
previously treated with one or more ALK-TKIs was shown by the results of Study 1001 as evidenced by 
rapid, deep, and durable responses, also across subgroups of baseline demographics (age, race, 
gender) and ECOG PS. 
Because there are no agents approved that confer substantial benefit for patients who have been 
previously treated with 2 or more ALK-TKIs, there is a substantial unmet need in this setting. Of note, 
this is a clinical situation that is similar to that in patients whose disease progressed after treatment 
with a second-generation ALK-TKI when used as the only ALK-TKI. 
In contrast to the poor outcome with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy, the ORR for 
lorlatinib after a second-generation ALK-TKI is compelling. 
Lorlatinib exhibited antitumor activity across a variety of ALK kinase domain resistance mutations, 
including the difficult-to-treat G1202R/G1202del mutations, and also evoked responses in tumours 
resistant to prior ALK-TKIs that did not harbour ALK resistance mutations. 
In addition to the systemic response, lorlatinib also exhibited rapid, deep, and durable intracranial 
responses consistent with its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lorlatinib has the potential 
to fulfil an important unmet medical need in this heavily pre-treated patient population. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
The applicant claims that despite the introduction of effective ALK-TKIs over the past several years, 
ALK-positive NSCLC is a serious, life-threatening disease that remains incurable. 
There is a high unmet medical need in patients for whom treatment with second-generation ALK-TKIs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 15/148 
 
 
 
 
such as alectinib or ceritinib has failed, because available treatment options are not effective and no 
therapies exist that would be specifically indicated in that setting. 
Consequently, new drugs are needed to overcome ALK-TKI resistance mechanisms and to enhance 
patient outcomes. 
Overall, the safety, efficacy, and PK data make lorlatinib a useful therapeutic option that should be 
made available to the public immediately. Based on the current timeline projections, waiting for 
randomised data from Phase 3 Study B7461006 may translate into a 1- to 3-year delay in the 
availability of lorlatinib in the EU for patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who have progressed 
after second generation ALK inhibitor.

100 mg lorlatinib as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate, sodium starch glycollate, and 
magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, macrogol, triacetin, titanium dioxide (E171), iron 
oxide black (E172), iron oxide red (E172). 
The product is available in OPA/Al/PVC blisters with aluminium foil backing as described in Section 6.5 
of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lorlatinib is (10R)-7-amino-12-fluoro-2,10,16-trimethyl-15-oxo-10,15,16,17-
tetrahydro-2H-4,8-methenopyrazolo[4,3-h][2,5,11]benzoxadiazacyclotetradecine-3-carbonitrile 
corresponding to the molecular formula C21H19FN6O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 406.41 
daltons and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 16/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, 
mass spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction, ultraviolet/visible 
(UV/Vis) spectrum, and specific optical rotation. The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by X-Ray diffraction. 
Lorlatinib is a non-hygroscopic white to off white powder. The aqueous solubility of lorlatinib is high at 
low pH (0.1 N HCl) and decreases with increasing pH. It has very low solubility above pH 4.5. It is 
classified as a BCS class 4 substance with low solubility and low permeability. Due to the low solubility 
of lorlatinib, the substance is milled and a requirement for particle size is included in the active 
substance specification. 
 The active substance exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre, giving 2 
possible stereoisomers. For lorlatinib, the absolute configuration at the 10-position is the R-optical 
isomer. 
Lorlatinib shows polymorphism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.   
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. An 
impurity risk assessment for mutagenicity according to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
M7 guideline has been performed for all actual and potential impurities. No mutagenicity impurities 
were detected. An overall risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D 
guideline is presented. 
Elements of quality by design (QbD) (enhanced approach) have been applied during the development 
of  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  substance,  in  order  to  gain  manufacturing  process 
knowledge and to define operating ranges.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC, 
PXRD), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC), particle size (laser light diffraction), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019

Stability 
Stability data of active substance stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, solid 
form, particle size, and microbial quality. With the exception of the chiral purity method, the analytical 
methods used in the primary stability program are the same as the release methods. 
There were no trends observed during the stability studies at any of the storage conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. As demonstrated 
by the photostability in packaging, the current packaging configuration, double antistatic low density 
polyethylene (LDPE) bags in high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum, adequately protects the active 
substance; therefore an additional light restriction is not required. 
Samples of the active substance were subjected to forced degradation conditions. Overall, lorlatinib is 
stable under various stressed conditions. No significant degradation was observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months with no 
recommendations on the storage temperature in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is formulated as immediate-release film coated tablets in 2 strengths (25 mg and 
100 mg). The 25 mg tablet is presented as a round, light pink film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” 
in one side and “25” and “LLN” on the other side. The 100 mg tablet is presented as an oval, dark pink 
film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “LLN 100” on the other side.  
The formulation and process development of lorlatinib immediate-release film-coated tablets focused 
on the quality attributes defined in a Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP).  
Lorlatinib is categorised as a BCS Class IV active substance (low solubility and low permeability) 
according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. Lorlatinib solubility is pH dependent, with 
solubility being highest under low pH gastric conditions in the fasted state. As such the impact of active 
substance particle size was an important consideration during finished product development.  
The selection of excipients for the commercial tablet formulations was based on the evaluation of the 
compatibility of the active substance with platform formulations using an accelerated stability program. 
Accelerated stability studies comparing coated tablets and uncoated tablet found no impact on stability 
from film-coating. Supporting development data and registration stability studies showed that the 
excipients selected are suitable to enable the finished product to achieve acceptable stability. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except Opadry II which complies with internal standards. However, the CHMP recommends 
submitting an appropriate variation application to establish or adopt a colour reference as part of the 
Opadry appearance acceptance criteria or alternatively develop an identity test that can distinguish 
between the two Opadry material types (Tan and Lavender). There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in Section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Assessment report

The finished product has been formulated as an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral 
administration. Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between 25 mg lorlatinib 
used in Phase 2 clinical tablet and the proposed commercial 25 mg and 100 mg lorlatinib tablets. There 
were considered bioequivalent. 
In vitro dissolution testing was performed to demonstrate the in vitro dissolution performance of the 
proposed commercial lorlatinib tablet strengths and the Phase 2 clinical tablet. The data are shown that 
there was no difference between the dissolution profiles of the formulations tested. 
A risk based approach was taken during the development of the commercial manufacturing process to 
guide the design of experiments and to ensure that final finished products of acceptable quality and 
stability are consistently produced. A risk assessment was conducted, which identified potential 
relationships between manufacturing process parameters finished product quality attributes.  
The  primary  packaging  is  OPA/Al/PVC  foil  blisters  with  aluminium  foil  backing.  The  material  complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice  of the container closure system  has been  validated  by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Lorlatinib 25 mg and 100 mg immediate release film-coated tablets are manufactured using a 
conventional dry granulation process which consists of 8 main steps: de-agglomeration, blending, 
intragranular lubricant blending, dry granulation (roller compaction and milling), extra-granular 
lubricant blending, tableting, film-coating and packaging. 
The manufacturing process for lorlatinib immediate release 25 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets uses 
conventional manufacturing techniques and equipment. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (LC,  UV/DAD),  assay  (LC),  degradation  products  (LC),  dissolution 
(LC), content uniformity (LC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from  3 commercial scale batches per strength of finished product stored  in commercial 
packaging system for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH and 30°C/75 % RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and 
microbial purity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 19/148 
 
 
 
 
The  long-term  and  accelerated  stability  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  finished  has  acceptable 
stability at the proposed storage condition in the proposed commercial packaging configurations. 
In addition, one batch per strength packed in HDPE bottles and aluminum foil lidding was exposed to 
light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  appearance,  assay,  water  content  and  dissolution.  The 
degradation product increased under light exposure. No increase was observed in the control samples. 
Formation of this degradant is controlled by the protective packaging configurations used. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  24  months  when  stored  in  OPA/Al/PVC 
blisters with aluminium foil backing without special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (Section 
6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and Veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To submit an appropriate variation application to establish or adopt a colour reference as part of the 
Opadry appearance acceptance criteria or alternatively develop an identity test that can distinguish 
between the 2 Opadry material types (Tan and Lavender).

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lorlatinib is a selective, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive small molecule inhibitor of the ALK 
and ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that also potently inhibits ALK kinase domain mutations 
responsible for resistance to ALK inhibitors. Oncogenic fusions of ALK and ROS1 define 2 distinct 
subsets of human lung adenocarcinoma patients and play essential roles in regulation of tumour cell 
survival, growth and metastasis (Soda et al, 2007; Bergethon et al, 2012). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Lorlatinib has been studied in a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies to determine activity by assessing 
inhibition of ALK or ROS1 tyrosine kinase activity, kinase selectivity, antitumor efficacy, PK/PD 
relationships, and mechanism of action. Lorlatinib was evaluated in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo safety 
pharmacology studies to identify potential effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and CNSs. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Inhibition of wild-type ALK, wild-type ROS1, and ALK mutant kinase activity in a biochemical 
enzyme assay (Study PF-06463922_12Mar13_174542) 
Recombinant  proteins  of  human  ALK  and  ROS1  kinase  domains,  including  various  clinically  relevant 
ALK  kinase  domain  mutants,  were  used  to  determine  lorlatinib  potency  against  RTK  targets  in 
biochemical enzyme assays.

in 
Biochemical 
and

Assays 
(Study PF-06463922_12Mar13_174542) 
To investigate kinase selectivity of lorlatinib relative to its target kinases, ALK and ROS1, lorlatinib was 
evaluated in biochemical kinase screening assays against a panel of 206 recombinant kinases.  
Eleven  (11)  kinases  were  identified  for  which  lorlatinib  exhibited  activity  and  showed  selectivity 
margins of less than 100x compared to the target ALKL1196M. 
The selectivity of lorlatinib was  further evaluated  in  a panel of cell-based assays for  selected kinases 
that were identified as potential relevant hits in biochemical assays.

(doses  that  showed  significant  antitumor  efficacy)  coupled  with  an  upregulation  of  pre-apoptosis 
protein BIM. In addition, a dose-dependent inhibition of Ki67 was also observed in the 3 and 10 mg/kg 
treatment groups. Marked dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylated ALK, ERK, AKT, and STAT3 was 
observed  at  dose  levels  of  1,  3,  and  10 mg/kg/day  at  1-hour  and  3-hour  time  points  post  dose 
following  4-days  of  lorlatinib  treatment  (PO,  BID).  Similar  effects  with  these  markers  were  also 
observed following 1 hour of lorlatinib treatment in cells, with the exception that AKT (S473) inhibition 
was  less  significant  than  in  tumour  tissues.  Furthermore,  a  significant  and  dose  dependent  down-
regulation  of  cell  cycle  protein  cyclin  D1  and  transcription  regulator  Myc  was  observed  in  the  3  and 
10 mg/kg/day  groups  in  the  H3122-EML4-ALKv1L1196M  model  corresponding  to  inhibition  of  cell 
proliferation  (Ki67  and  cell  viability),  induction  of  apoptosis  (caspase  3),  and  significant  antitumor 
efficacy. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In the assessment of secondary pharmacology, lorlatinib was profiled in vitro against a broad panel of 
receptors, enzymes, transporters, and ion channels in a wide ligand screening panel at concentrations 
up  to  10 M.  Less  than  50%  inhibition  of  binding  or  enzymatic  activity  was  observed  against  most 
profiled targets with the exception of the  following  enzymes: acetylcholinesterase  (73.0% inhibition), 
AurA/Aur2  kinase  (87.0%  inhibition),  EGFR  (73.6%  inhibition),  and  Lck  (53.4%  inhibition),  with  the 
enzymatic 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for these activities determined to be >7000x the 
enzymatic IC50 value for the target ALKL1196M (0.7 nM, 0.3 ng/mL). 
The kinase selectivity profile of lorlatinib was also evaluated in a broad biochemical kinase panel of 206 
recombinant  kinases.  Eleven  (11)  kinases  were  identified  for  which  lorlatinib  exhibited  activity  and 
showed selectivity margins of less than 100x compared to the target ALKL1196M. 
There was no binding or enzymatic activity at 10 M for the metabolite PF-06895751.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Lorlatinib was evaluated in in vitro, ex vivo, and/or in vivo safety pharmacology studies to identify 
potential effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and CNS.  
-  Cardiovascular Effects 
In vitro, lorlatinib inhibited hERG (IC50=82,489 ng/ml) and calcium currents (IC50 = 17,871 ng/ml), 
ICs50 that correspond to 350x and 76x the human clinical exposure at 100 mg once daily (Cmax = 236 
ng/ml), respectively. Inhibition of the sodium current was not observed at doses ≤100 µM. 
Antagonist effect on calcium channel was not observed in the isolated rat aorta model where lorlatinib 
did not produce vasoconstriction in aortic rings at ≤30 µM.  
Ex vivo, lorlatinib induced an increase in PR interval in a concentration-dependent manner from 1 µM 
(406 ng/ml) to 30 µM (12,193 ng/ml). There were no effects on any other parameters evaluated such 
as dP/dt (contractility), left ventricular pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, QRS and QT intervals. 
The in vivo study has been conducted in conscious animals. Oral administration of lorlatinib induced an 
increase in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, an initial decrease and later increase in heart 
rate in rat at 10 and 30 mg/kg. No exposure measures were conducted in this study. In a previous 
single-dose rat toxicokinetic study, the administration of lorlatinib at 10 and 30 mg/kg resulted in 
unbound AUC24 values of 4700 and 16,200 ng∙h/ml, respectively, and unbound Cmax values of 524 and 
1640 ng/ml, respectively. In dog, oral administration of lorlatinib at 15 mg/kg/day induced an increase 
in heart rate and decrease systolic blood pressure, PR and QRS interval prolongation and increase 
fractional shortening with unbound mean Cmax and AUC24 values of 519 ng/ml and 6690 ng∙h/ml, 
respectively. No cardiovascular changes were observed at doses of 2 mg/kg/day with associated 
unbound mean Cmax and AUC24 values of 68 ng/ml and 890 ng∙h/ml, respectively. 
PF-06895751, a major human circulating metabolite of lorlatinib, did not inhibit hERG potassium ion 
channels with an IC50 >300 M (55,260 ng/ml). 
-  Neurofunctional Effects 
Lorlatinib was shown to be a brain penetrable compound, with measurable concentrations in the brain 
and CSF in the rat, dog, and human. 
Lorlatinib caused a significant reduction in amplitude of long term potentiation in hippocampal brain 
slices, a measure that is widely considered to be one of the cellular mechanisms that underlie learning 
and memory formation. This effect was observed at 1 M (406 ng/mL), a concentration above the cell-
based TrkB IC50 of 93 ng/mL whereas the effect was not observed at 0.1 M (41 ng/ml). 
In a contextual renewal model, lower memory recall scores were observed at ≥3 mg/kg/day following 
a single dose of lorlatinib. The unbound brain concentrations of lorlatinib (137 and 511 ng/g4) at 10 
and 30 mg/kg doses, respectively, exceeded both the wild-type cell-based ALK IC50 of 0.6 ng/ml 
(primary pharmacology) and was similar to the cell-based TrkB IC50 of 93 ng/ml (secondary 
pharmacology). At 3 mg/kg, variability in the pharmacologic sensitivity was identified between studies, 
with the unbound brain concentrations of lorlatinib (24.6 to 31.4 ng/g) below the cell based TrkB IC50. 
No effects were observed on cue-induced renewal responding or total number of nose pokes, other 
measurements of cognitive function, or indirect measures of activity.  
In addition, after 14 days of lorlatinib administration to rats, on Day 3 and 13, functional effects were 
observed such as, abnormal behaviour (i.e. teeth chattering), involuntary movements (i.e. retropulsion 
and trembling), reduced handling reactivity, decreased arousal, abnormal gait, and reduced reflex 
responses (i.e. uncoordinated air righting-reflex, and reduced extensor thrust response). There were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 28/148 
 
 
 
 
no lorlatinib-related FOB findings at 20 mg/kg/day. No functional observational effects were identified 
in the pivotal toxicity studies following 4 and 13 weeks of dosing. There were no microscopic findings 
observed in the CNS in any of the studies conducted in rats or dogs, although non-adverse lower brain 
weights were observed in rats after 13 weeks of lorlatinib administration. The no-observed-adverse-
effect-level (NOAEL) in rats, 15 mg/kg/day with an associated unbound AUC24 exposure of 13,600 
(males) and 39700 ng•h/ml (females) following 13 weeks of lorlatinib administration, provide a margin 
of 7.1x the unbound human steady-state AUC exposure (1920 ng∙h/ml) at the recommended dose of 
100 mg QD. 
-  Respiratory Effects 
Lorlatinib was administered to male rats (6/group) at single doses of 0 (vehicle), 10, 30, or 
100 mg/kg. Statistically significantly lower mean tidal volumes were observed at doses ≥30 mg/kg. 
There were no significant changes in respiratory rate or minute volume at ≤100 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with lorlatinib have been submitted (see non-clinical 
discussion). 
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) properties of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) were evaluated in vivo in rats and dogs and to a lesser 
extent in rabbits using oral and/or intravenous (IV) routes of administration. In vitro studies were also 
conducted to assess plasma protein binding of lorlatinib, partitioning of lorlatinib into red blood cells, 
hepatic uptake properties by transporters, drug metabolism of lorlatinib, and to assess the effects of 
lorlatinib on selected cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) enzymes, and selected efflux and uptake transporter activities. 
An LC-MS/MS method has been developed for quantification of lorlatinib in rat, rabbit and dog plasma. 
This method appears to be sufficiently validated for the TK studies. Furthermore, a non-validated LC-
MS/MS method has been used to measure lorlatinib concentrations in brain and CSF for both rats and 
dogs. An LC MS/MS method was also developed and validated for quantification of the metabolite, PF-
06895751 in both rat and dog plasma to be used in the 13-week toxicity studies. The applied analytical 
methods are considered appropriate and validated for their purpose. 
Absorption 
In rats and dogs, following intravenous (IV) administration, lorlatinib exhibited low plasma clearance 
(CL) of 15.5 ml/min/kg in rats and 9 ml/min/kg in dogs, and a volume of distribution (Vss) of 2.66 
L/kg in rats and 2.8 L/kg in dogs, which exceeded total body water, suggesting extensive distribution 
to tissues. Oral bioavailability was high (>100% in rats and 96.6% in dogs).  
The toxicokinetics of lorlatinib were evaluated as part of oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs, EFD studies in rats and rabbits, and in support of phototoxicity evaluation.  
The systemic exposure to lorlatinib increased with increasing dose over the dose range evaluated in 
the toxicology studies.  
PF-06895751 (or M8) was a major pharmacologically inactive metabolite in human plasma that was 
also observed in rat and dog plasma following oral administration of 13-week repeat doses of lorlatinib. 
However, the unbound plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of PF-06895751 in rat 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 29/148 
 
 
 
 
and dog plasma following oral administration of repeat doses of lorlatinib was <4% of that observed in 
humans after oral administration of multiple doses of lorlatinib (100 mg once daily [QD]). 
Lorlatinib was not a substrate for P-gp or BCRP, and these efflux mechanisms are expected to have 
minimal effect on the absorption of lorlatinib.  
Distribution 
[14C]Lorlatinib-derived radioactivity was well distributed to most tissues and organs in male pigmented 
Long Evans rats, and was consistent with a Vss for lorlatinib that exceeded total body water. The 
uptake and retention of [14C]lorlatinib-derived radioactivity was particularly prominent in the 
pigmented uveal tract. Tissues with the highest Cmax values for radioequivalents were observed for the 
uveal tract, liver, intervertebral discs, adrenal gland, and Harderian gland. Radioactivity concentrations 
were observed for up to 24 hours post-dose in non-circumventricular CNS tissues protected by the 
blood-brain barrier. In the vast majority of tissues, the elimination of [14C]lorlatinib-derived 
radioactivity was complete by 96 hours post-dose. However, the QWBA shows a high AUClast and a 
slow t½ (more than 10 days) in some tissues like the eyes, the kidneys and the thyroid after a single 
oral dose of 10 mg/kg. However, a rapid decline in lorlatinib concentration was seen during the first 48 
hours pose dose, followed by a slow terminal t½ in these tissues. 
Lorlatinib can cross the BBB and distribute to the CNS tissues in rats and dogs. In addition, quantifiable 
lorlatinib concentrations were also observed in brain and CSF samples obtained at necropsy in the 4-
week toxicity study in rats and dogs. 
In HEK293 cells transfected with OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, lorlatinib was not a substrate for either of 
these hepatic uptake transporters. 
Lorlatinib and its major pharmacologically inactive metabolite (M8, PF-06895751) in humans showed 
moderate binding to proteins in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma. 
In vitro, lorlatinib showed similar partitioning between the blood cells and plasma compartments for 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human. 
Placental transfer of lorlatinib was not studied. 
Metabolism 
In vivo 
After oral administration, the major primary metabolic pathways of [14C]lorlatinib in rats and humans 
involved oxidation and glucuronidation, while oxidation was mainly involved in dogs. Although the 
glucuronidation pathway for lorlatinib was observed in both rats and humans, the positions of the 
glucuronide conjugates on the lorlatinib molecule differed between rats (M1b) and humans (M1a).  
Similarity in the oxidative metabolic pathways and the presence of the major human circulating 
metabolite (M8) supports the selection of rats and dogs as the non-clinical species for toxicology 
evaluations. 
Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) and pyrazole N-desmethyl lorlatinib (M2a, PF-06648706) were the major 
circulating entities in rat and dog plasma.  
In human plasma, lorlatinib was the most abundant drug-related component, representing 44.4% of 
plasma AUC of the circulating radioactivity. The major circulating metabolite for lorlatinib in humans 
was a cleaved product of lorlatinib (PF-06895751, M8), which likely was formed via multiple 
biotransformation steps and accounted for 21% of circulating radioactivity. This metabolite constituted 
a disproportionate circulating metabolite as the unbound plasma AUC in humans (854 ng•h/ml) 
following oral administration of multiple 100 mg QD doses of lorlatinib (CSR; Study B7461001) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 30/148 
 
 
 
 
exceeded those observed in rats (32.1 ng•h/ml [male], 9.32 ng•h/ml [female]) and dogs (20.1 
ng•h/ml) at the highest doses tested in the 13-week toxicity studies.  
In vitro 
The in vitro metabolism of lorlatinib in liver microsomes and hepatocytes was generally low across the 
evaluated species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and human).  
CYP-mediated metabolism contributed approximately 67% to the clearance for lorlatinib based on 
parent drug disappearance, with ~33% of the clearance derived from non-CYP mediated process.  
Lorlatinib was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3. Formation of PF-06895751 likely involved, at least in part, 
CYP3A4/5 as administration of itraconazole with lorlatinib to humans reduced the plasma AUC for this 
metabolite compared to lorlatinib alone.  
In in vitro studies, CYP3A4 was consistently identified to contribute to the formation of M6. Formation 
of M2a was mediated mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with minor contributions from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, 
and CYP1A2.  
Glucuronidation of lorlatinib constituted a major clearance pathway in humans, with the glucuronide 
conjugate (M1a, PF-06924938) comprising a mean of ~13.5% of dose in excreta (10.9% in urine, 
2.6% in faeces). Results from in vitro evaluations using HLM and recombinant human (rh)UGT 
enzymes indicated that UGT1A4 was the primary enzyme mediating the glucuronidation of lorlatinib to 
form M1a, with minor contribution from UGT1A3. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of [14C]lorlatinib, the primary route of elimination of radioactivity was via 
the faeces in rats and dogs, whereas in humans, elimination involved both the urinary (47% dose 
recovered) and faecal routes (40.9% dose recovered). Excretion in milk was not tested. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Lorlatinib and cytochromes 
In vitro, lorlatinib demonstrated little or no reversible or time dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzyme activities (half maximal inhibitory 
concentration [IC50] >100 µM) except for CYP2C9 where IC50 for reversible inhibition was 44 µM and 
for CYP3A4/5 where IC50 were 23, 10 and 22 µM for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, midazolam 1’-
hydroxylation, and nifedipine oxidation, respectively.  
Although in vitro, lorlatinib showed reversible inhibition and TDI towards CYP3A4/5, in human 
hepatocytes, lorlatinib has also been shown to induce CYP3A4 and to activate human pregnane X 
receptor (hPXR).  
PF-06895751, the major circulating metabolite of lorlatinib in humans, showed little or no reversible 
inhibition and no TDI for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at concentrations 
up to 100 µM. PF-06895751 showed weak TDI for CYP3A4/5. 
In human hepatocytes, lorlatinib caused a dose-dependent induction of CYP3A4 at concentrations ≥0.1 
µM, and the same for dose-dependent induction of CYP3A4/5 activity (midazolam 1’ hydroxylation) at 
concentration up to 3 or 10 µM and it also caused activation of the hPXR in a dose-dependent manner 
over the concentration range of 0.01 to 100 µM, with the EC50 and the Emax of 2.76 and 13-fold, 
respectively, comparable to those observed with rifampin (2.76 µM and 13-fold, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 31/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment of human hepatocytes with lorlatinib caused ≥2-fold dose-dependent induction of CYP2B6 
mRNA and enzymatic activity (bupropion hydroxylation) at concentrations of ≥0.5 µM. In addition, 
lorlatinib (0.01-50 µM) also caused dose-dependent hCAR1 activation up to 6.46-fold, while the 
positive controls phenobarbital (3.1 to 750 µM) and CITCO (0.005 to 20 µM) showed dose-dependent 
activation of up to 3.05 and 22.46-fold.  
In vitro, lorlatinib showed an increase (≥2-fold) in CYP1A2 mRNA in 1 of 3 lots of human hepatocytes 
at concentrations ≥50 µM, but no induction of the enzymatic activity in all 3 lots. The lowest 
concentration associated with no induction of CYP1A2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 µM) 
exceeded the 50x unbound Cmax (Cmax,u) value (~24 µM). 
In vitro, PF 06895751 showed a low potential to cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
Lorlatinib and UGTs (UDP-glucoronyl transferase) 
In vitro studies indicated a low likelihood of inhibitory DDI by lorlatinib with UGT1A4, UGT1A6, 
UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 but the IC50 value obtained for inhibition of UGT1A1 (46 µM) indicates 
there may be a potential for lorlatinib to inhibit UGT1A1. PF-06895751 demonstrated little or no 
reversible inhibition of UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 (IC50 >100 µM) in 
HLM with or without the addition of 2% BSA. 
Lorlatinib and protein transporters 
Lorlatinib showed a low potential to cause DDI by inhibiting BCRP (systemically), OAT1, OCT2 and 
MATE2K, but has the potential to inhibit P-gp (systemically and GI tract), BCRP (GI tract), OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT3, and MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Since lorlatinib is an activator 
of hPXR in vitro, which regulates the expression of P-gp (Urquhart et al., 2007), the net effect of 
lorlatinib on P-gp activity in vivo is not known. 
In vitro, PF-06895751 did not inhibit the activities of Pgp and BCRP mediated efflux of respective 
substrates at concentrations up to 268 µM, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1 at concentrations up to 50 or 
100 µM and OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K at concentrations up to 50 or 100 µM. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The oral route of administration was selected for these studies since it is the intended route of clinical 
exposure.  Rats  and  dogs  were  dosed  twice  daily  (BID),  approximately  6  or  7  hours  apart  to  ensure 
appropriate  exposure  in  a  24-hour  period  and  was  also  supportive  of  the  continuous  daily  dosing 
planned in the clinic. Due to a gender difference in exposure observed in rats, doses in the 4- and 13-
week  rat  toxicity  studies  were  twice  as  high  in  male  as  in  female  animals,  in  an  attempt  to  achieve 
comparable systemic exposures.  
Most of the pivotal toxicity studies were conducted using the free base of lorlatinib (PF-06463922, 
anhydrous form); however, the genotoxicity studies and some of the pivotal and non-pivotal and 
investigational studies used the acetic acid solvate form of lorlatinib (PF-06463922-14), and the 14- 
day non-pivotal toxicity study in dogs and electro-retinography study in rats used the hydrochloride 
salt form of lorlatinib (PF-06463922-01). The free base form of lorlatinib represents the form that will 
be commercially available for clinical use.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Lorlatinib was administered to rats and dogs in toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration with BID 
dosing. Moribundity preceded by clinical signs of intolerance was observed in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies at ≥30 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥25 mg/kg/day in dogs where systemic exposure exceeded 
exposure at clinically relevant doses. 
The main target organs:  
- Inflammation was observed in the skin and cervix of rats and the lung, trachea, skin, lymph nodes 
and/or the oral cavity including mandibular bone of dogs in repeat-dose studies of ≥4 weeks in 
duration and was associated with moribundity in dogs during the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study. 
Inflammation in multiple tissues was associated higher WBC counts, fibrinogen, and/or globulin and 
lower albumin in rats and dogs. The inflammatory response in tissues and associated changes in 
clinical pathology parameters were partially to completely reversible following a 4-week non-dosing 
period in both rats and dogs. 
-Pancreas: acinar atrophy with decreased zymogen granules and occasional single cell necrosis, and/or 
islet angiectasis. The incidence and severity of the pancreatic findings were dose-related and often 
correlated with elevations of amylase and lipase.  
-Hepatobiliary system: Bile duct hyperplasia associated with elevations in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, 
ALP, GLDH, and/or GGT) was observed in rats and dogs. Increases in sinusoidal Kupffer cell 
pigmentation and mild haemorrhage in the mucosa of the gallbladder was also observed after 13 
weeks of dosing in dogs. Findings in the liver included higher liver weights in rats with microscopic 
observations of hepatocellular hypertrophy and/or increased sinusoidal cellularity; higher liver weights 
with no microscopic correlates was observed in dogs. The bile duct hyperplasia was considered adverse 
when associated with increased bilirubin or presence of icterus in rats and when at moderate severity 
in dogs.  
-Male reproductive organs: seminiferous tubule degeneration with associated secondary effects and/or 
glandular atrophy of the prostate were observed in rats and dogs in repeat-dose toxicity studies ≥2 
weeks in duration. Partial or complete reversibility of the effects was demonstrated. 
-Cardiovascular system: changes in blood pressure and heart rate and associated secondary effects on 
cardiac parameters of lorlatinib were identified in telemetered rats and dogs in single- and/or repeat-
dose studies. Higher heart weights with no microscopic correlates were observed in rats after 4 weeks 
of dosing; higher heart weights associated with minimally increased cellularity of Anichkov cells was 
identified after 13 weeks of dosing. These changes likely reflect a compensatory response to 
hemodynamic changes and not a direct effect on cardiac tissue. Lorlatinib administration to dogs 
Assessment report

Page 33/148 
 
 
 
 
resulted in ECG changes with increases in PR intervals considered to be a direct effect of lorlatinib; 
other changes were considered secondary to increased heart rate.  
-Gastrointestinal tract: Clinical signs of gastrointestinal effects (emesis and/or abnormal faeces), 
stomach (erosions and/or ulceration), and intestinal macroscopic/microscopic findings (non-adverse 
single cell necrosis, villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, epithelial degeneration, and/or subacute 
inflammation) were observed in rats and/or dogs. Partial or complete reversibility of the effects was 
demonstrated. 
-Peripheral nerves: Axonal degeneration was observed in rats at ≥4 weeks of dosing. Dysregulation of 
BDNF-TrkB signalling through TrkB inhibition might be a potential mechanism of the observed axon 
degeneration. Complete reversibility of axon degeneration in rats. 
-CNS: No functional observational effects were identified in the pivotal toxicity studies following 4 and 
13 weeks of dosing. Functional observational battery effects after 14 days of lorlatinib administration 
to rats included abnormal behaviour (i.e. teeth chattering), involuntary movements (i.e. retropulsion 
and trembling), reduced handling reactivity, decreased arousal, abnormal gait, and reduced reflex 
responses (i.e. uncoordinated air righting-reflex, and reduced extensor thrust response) at 60 
mg/kg/day. No functional observational effects were identified in the pivotal toxicity studies following 4 
and 13 weeks of dosing at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day, despite achieving comparable systemic 
exposures as the 60 mg/kg/day in the 14-day study. There were no microscopic findings observed in 
the CNS in any of the studies conducted in rats or dogs, although non-adverse lower brain weights 
were observed in rats after 13 weeks of lorlatinib administration. The potential for an effect on 
cognitive function was suggested from an ex vivo hippocampal brain slice assay and an exploratory in 
vivo contextual renewal model in rats.  
-Kidney: Renal changes including glomerulopathy, arterial degeneration/necrosis, increased incidence 
and/or severity of tubular basophilia and pigmentation, and hyaline casts were observed in rats 
following 13 weeks of dosing, and correlated with urinalysis changes. Alterations in renal biomarkers 
without microscopic correlates were observed in rats at 4 weeks. The renal changes in rats were 
partially or completely reversible. 
-Haematolymphopoietic system: Alterations in the cellularity of the spleen, lymph nodes, and/or 
thymus with associated haematological changes were identified in rats and dogs following ≥2 and ≥4 
weeks of lorlatinib administration, respectively. The haematolymphopoietic findings were not 
considered adverse due to limited severity and/or adaptive nature of the changes. Partial or complete 
reversibility was demonstrated. 
-Body weight changes: Lorlatinib administration caused dose-related non-adverse higher body weight 
and body weight gain that correlated with higher food consumption in rats after ≤13 weeks of lorlatinib 
administration. Similar lorlatinib-related effects did not occur in dogs. 
-Hyperlipidaemia (cholesterol and triglycerides) was observed in rats and dogs following ≥2 weeks 
lorlatinib administration. The finding of increased food consumption, body weight gain, and cholesterol 
after lorlatinib administration were likely due to off-target inhibition of TrkB.  
Other non-adverse findings observed inconsistently in rats and/or dogs after ≥4 weeks of lorlatinib 
administration included minimal to moderate mammary gland atrophy (male rats), minimal secretory 
depletion in the salivary (rats), and changes in adrenal gland weight (decreased in rats and increased 
in dogs), minimal electrolyte imbalances (rats and dogs), uterine atrophy (rats), and minimal 
decreases in brain weight (rats). 
The NOAELs were identified as 8/4 (M/F) mg/kg/day in rats and 7 mg/kg/day in dogs, with associated 
unbound AUC24 exposures of 6240/7820 ng•h/ml and 2980 ng•h/ml, respectively, following 13 weeks

of lorlatinib administration. The NOAELs in rats and dogs provide margins of 3.3x (male)/4.1x (female) 
and 1.6x, respectively, the unbound human steady-state AUC exposure of 1920 ng•h/mL at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg QD. However, it seems that the NOAELs following 13 weeks of BID 
dosing in rats and dogs were not well established given the toxicities observed at those doses. 
The exposure of the main metabolite of lorlatinib (PF-06895751, M8) were obtained from 13-week 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. However, the unbound plasma area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of PF-06895751 in rat and dog plasma following oral administration of 
repeat doses of lorlatinib was <4% of that observed in humans after oral administration of multiple 
doses of lorlatinib (100 mg once daily [QD]). 
Genotoxicity 
Lorlatinib was tested in a conventional genotoxicity battery. It was identified as an aneugen, but not a 
mutagen or clastogen following genetic toxicity assessments. Significant increases in micronucleus 
formation were detected in vitro in TK6 cells following 4 hours of lorlatinib treatment at concentrations 
≥293 µg/mL with or without metabolic activation. Lorlatinib induced significant increases in 
micronucleus formation at 100 mg/kg/day but not at ≤30 mg/kg/day following 2 days of 
administration in rats. Centromere analysis in the in vitro micronucleus assay determined that positive 
micronucleus results (in vitro and in vivo) were due to an aneugenic mechanism. As it is widely 
accepted that aneugens induce their effects by a threshold mechanism, a NOEL was established for 
micronucleus formation in vivo at 30 mg/kg/day in male and female rats, with associated unbound 
AUC24 values of 17,700 (males) and 45,500 ng•h/ml (females) providing margins of 9.2x (males) and 
24x (females) the unbound human steady-state AUC exposure of 1920 ng•h/ml, at the clinical dose of 
100 mg QD. 
PF-06895751, the major human metabolite of lorlatinib was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse 
mutation assay when tested up to 5000 µg/plate and did not cause micronucleus formation in an in 
vitro micronucleus assay.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with lorlatinib were submitted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No fertility studies were performed. Effects on male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, and/or 
prostate) were observed in rats and dogs in repeat-dose toxicity studies after ≥2 weeks of lorlatinib 
administration. Seminiferous tubular degeneration and/or atrophy in the testes, and epididymal 
changes (inflammation and/or vacuolation) were observed in the rat and dog. In the prostate, minimal 
to mild glandular atrophy was observed at 25 mg/kg/day in dogs. These changes correlated with lower 
testes, epididymis and prostate weights in dogs. Partial or complete reversibility of the effects on male 
reproductive system was demonstrated following a 4-week non-dosing recovery period after 4 or 13 
weeks of lorlatinib administration to rats and dogs. 
Preliminary GLP embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Because 
embryo-foetal toxicity and developmental abnormalities were observed in the preliminary studies, 
pivotal studies were not conducted. 
Lorlatinib-related maternal toxicity and developmental toxicities including lower embryo-foetal viability, 
lower embryo-foetal viability, lower mean foetal body weights, and/or foetal malformations (including

rotated limbs, supernumerary digits, gastroschisis, malformed kidneys, domed head, high arched 
palate, and dilation of ventricles of the brain) were observed in rats and rabbits. There were no animal 
to human exposure margins for lorlatinib at the developmental lowest-observed-adverse-effect level 
(LOAEL) in the rat (1 mg/kg/day) and the developmental NOAEL in the rabbit (1 mg/kg/day). No pre- 
and postnatal studies were performed.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  data  have  been  obtained  from  repeat-dose  toxicity  of  Lorlatinib  in  rats  and  dogs. 
Likewise, the exposure of the main metabolite of lorlatinib (PF-06895751, M8) has been obtained from 
13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs.

Local Tolerance  
Administration of lorlatinib was not associated with vascular or perivascular irritation at the doses 
tested and was not considered to cause local irritation. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
A dedicated immunotoxicity study has not been performed. Potential immunotoxic effects of lorlatinib 
were addressed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
Mechanistic studies 
Metabolic and Lipid Profile Studies 
Lorlatinib administration was associated with increases in body weight and body weight gain with 
correlated increases in food consumption in rats and elevations in cholesterol and/or triglycerides in 
rats and dogs at ≥2 weeks in duration.  
Mechanistic studies 7 days to 4 weeks in duration were conducted in rats to further evaluate the time 
course of effects on fractionated lipid profiles and the potential mechanism associated with the body 
weight and food consumption changes.  
CNS Toxicity 
The potential for CNS effects and impairment of cognitive function was suggested from the ex vivo 
hippocampal brain slice model, the rat contextual renewal model, and FOB assessments in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. Clinical signs of CNS effects were observed and animals with higher exposure to 
lorlatinib were more likely to exhibit a higher incidence of CNS effects. 
Phototoxicity 
The NOEL for phototoxicity in rats provided a margin of 17x, the unbound human steady-state AUC 
exposure of 1920 ng•h/ml at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily (QD). 
Metabolites  
No separate non-clinical evaluation of metabolites has been conducted.  
In vitro bacterial reverse mutation and micronucleus assays were conducted with the major human 
circulating metabolite (PF-06895751) of lorlatinib (see Genotoxicity). 
Impurities 
Four impurities (PF-06752166, PF-06876367, PF-06744689 and PF-06856050) are specified above 
0.15%, the level of qualification in the drug substance. These impurities were tested in a 4-week 
repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. The adverse effects in this impurity qualification study were 
consistent with those observed in the other repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
According to the guideline ICH Q3A, genotoxicity studies have to be conducted. An in vitro bacterial 
reverse mutation assay that demonstrates that PF-06744689 impurities is not mutagenic, clastogenic 
or aneugenic with a lower NOAEL than lorlatinib has been submitted. PF-06752166, PF-06876367 and 
PF-06856050 have been assessed in 2 validated and complimentary in silico systems with additional 
expert analysis in accordance with ICH M7 guidance and are predicted to be not mutagenic (Class 4).

PF-06856050 and PF-06752166 share structural features and SARAH hypothesis with the parent and 
were thus qualified by Ames negative test of the parent. PF-06752166 is qualified by Ames negative 
tests of PF-06668559, PF-06841215, and parent which share the same structural features and Sarah 
hypotheses as this impurity. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the Phase 1 screening environmental risk assessment, the PECsurfacewater for lorlatinib was calculated 
as 0.005 µg/L, using a refined Fpen for the target patient population.  
Lorlatinib PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, lorlatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics evaluation of lorlatinib demonstrated that lorlatinib is a potent 
inhibitor  of  wild-type  ALK,  wild-type  ROS1,  and  several  ALK  mutant  kinase  activity.  Comparing  to 
crizotinib,  lorlatinib  had  significantly  enhanced  potency  against  ALK  mutations.  Primary  in  vivo 
pharmacodynamics  of  lorlatinib  were  evaluated  in  human  xenograft  tumour  models  in  athymic  mice. 
Subcutaneous  xenograft  models  tested  for  ALK  and  ROS  fusions  including  secondary  ALK  mutations. 
An  orthotopic  brain  metastasis  model  was  also  used.  The  in  vivo  pharmacodynamics  studies  with 
lorlatinib  showed  significant  and  dose  dependent  antitumor  activity  against  a  broad  range  of 
mutations.  The  safety  pharmacology  studies  conducted  revealed  a  cardiovascular  safety  signal  in  in 
vitro, ex vivo and in in vivo studies. Furthermore, lorlatinib appears to affect memory recall in the rat 
at clinically relevant exposure levels. 
Single  dose  pharmacokinetics  and  bioavailability  of  lorlatinib  were  evaluated  in  rats  and  beagle  dogs 
after  administration  of  a  single  oral  dose.  Lorlatinib  appears  to  be  readily  absorbed  with  a  very  high 
bioavailability  in  both  rats  and  dogs.  Repeated  dose  pharmacokinetics  of  lorlatinib  were  evaluated  in 
rats,  dogs  and  rabbits.  Repeated  dose  studies  in  male  and  female  rats  showed  dose  proportionality. 
However, a sex-related difference  in exposure  was seen.  Neither dogs  nor  rabbits showed  these sex-
related differences.  
Lorlatinib  appears  to  be  distributed  in  all  tissues,  which  is  consistent  with  the  Vss  being  higher  than 
total body water and thereby reflecting distribution to tissue including distribution to CNS.

The rat and dog were selected as the rodent and non-rodent species, respectively, for general toxicity 
studies  because  they  demonstrated  the  ability  to  assess  potential  toxicities  from  both  primary  and 
secondary pharmacological targets, exposure profiles were sufficient, and there was representation of 
major metabolism pathways observed in humans.  
The single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were not GLP compliant. This is accepted, as there are 
GLP compliant repeated dose toxicity studies that cover this part of the toxicity evaluation. 
The  main  toxicities  observed  were  inflammation  across  multiple  tissues  (skin  and  cervix  of  rats  and 
lung, trachea, skin, lymph nodes and/or the oral cavity including mandibular bone of dogs; associated 
with increases in white blood cells, fibrinogen, and/or globulin and decreases in albumin) and changes 
in  the  pancreas  (with  increases  in  amylase  and  lipase),  hepatobiliary  system  (with  increases  in  liver 
enzymes),  male  reproductive  system,  cardiovascular  system,  kidneys  and  gastrointestinal  tract, 
peripheral  nerves  and  the  CNS  (potential  for  cognitive  functional  impairment)  (at  dose  equivalent  to 
human clinical exposure at the recommended posology. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and 
QRS  complex  and  PR  interval  were  also  observed  in  animals  after  acute  dosing  (approximately 
2.6 times the human clinical exposure at 100 mg after a single dose based on Cmax). All target organ 
findings  with  the  exception  of  hepatic  bile  duct  hyperplasia  were  partially  to  fully  reversible  (see 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Lorlatinib  is  not  mutagenic  but  is  aneugenic  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  with  a  no  observed  effect  level  for 
aneugenicity  approximately  16.5  times  human  clinical  exposure  at  100  mg  based  on  AUC.  No 
carcinogenicity studies were conducted with lorlatinib which is acceptable in line with ICH S9 guideline.  
Seminiferous tubular degeneration and/or atrophy in the testes, and epididymal changes (inflammation 
and/or  vacuolation)  were  observed  in  the  rat  and  dog.  In  the  prostate,  minimal  to  mild  glandular 
atrophy  was  observed  in  dogs  at  dose  equivalent  to  human  clinical  exposure  at  the  recommended 
posology). The effects on male reproductive organs were partially to fully reversible. 
In embryo foetal toxicity studies, conducted in rats and rabbits, respectively, increased embryolethality 
and  lower  foetal  body  weights  and  malformations  were  observed.  Foetal  morphologic  abnormalities 
included  rotated  limbs,  supernumerary  digits,  gastroschisis,  malformed  kidneys,  domed  head,  high 
arched  palate,  and  dilation  of  ventricles  of  the  brain.  The  exposure  at  the  lowest  doses  with  embryo 
foetal effects in animals was equivalent to the human clinical exposure at 100 mg, based on AUC (see 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Lorlatinib is not expected to result in phototoxicity in the eyes or skin upon UV radiation exposure after 
repeat dosing. 
The Environmental Risk Assessment of the  medicinal  product lorlatinib, was realised  according to  the 
“Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr1,  2006)  and  considering  the  Questions  and  Answers  document  on  it 
(EMEA 2011). 
In the Phase 1 screening environmental risk assessment, the PECsurfacewater for lorlatinib was calculated 
as 0.005 µg/L, using a refined Fpen for the target patient population. The refined PECsurfacewater is lower 
than the 0.01 µg/L action limit for continuing to a Phase 2 Tier A assessment. 
The octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) was estimated using  a validated and recognised method 
“Shake Flask Method” according to the OECD 107. The log Pow values for lorlatinib are 2.23, 2.47 and 
2.45  at  pHs  5,  7  and  9,  respectively,  which  are  below  the  trigger  value  of  4.5  for  conducting  a  PBT 
assessment.

increasing dose 
levels in patients 
with ALK-positive 
or ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC 
in order to

Japan LICa:  
To evaluate the 
safety and PK of 
lorlatinib in 
Japanese patients 
treated at a 
previously tested 
dose in Phase 1 
(Japan Sites only).   
Japan LIC was considered separate from Phase 1 and Phase 2 in terms of efficacy and safety evaluations; however PK 
a. 
data for the LIC patients and Phase 2 patients were summarized together. 
b.  Study B7461001 enrolled 55 patients in Phase 1, however only 54 patients received the treatment. Therefore, all other 
numbers reported in this table are based on total 54 patients. 
c.  Study B7461001 enrolled 276 patients in Phase 2, however only 275 patients received the treatment. Therefore, all other 
numbers reported in this table are based on total 275 patients. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The majority of clinical studies conducted with lorlatinib enrolled healthy volunteers. Study B7461001 
(Phase 1/2) was conducted in patients. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods using LC-MS/MS for the quantitative determination of lorlatinib in plasma, urine 
and CSF, for cortisol and 6β-hydroxycortisol in urine and for rifampin, desacetyl rifampin, midazolam, 
cholesterol and 4β-hydroxycholesterol in plasma were developed and validated at contract 
laboratories. LC-MS/MS methods for quantification of PF-06895751 (major human metabolite of 
lorlatinib) in plasma was developed and validated at Pfizer PDM (Groton, USA). Validations were 
conducted in compliance with current guidelines on bioanalytical method validation.

PK parameters for lorlatinib and its metabolite PF-06895751 (M8) were derived from concentration vs 
time  data,  and  estimated  by  non-compartmental  methods.  Plasma  concentrations  vs  time  data  were 
modelled  using  a  nonlinear  mixed  effects  population  analysis  approach  in  NONlinear  Mixed  Effects 
Modeling (NONMEM).  
Evaluation and qualification of models 
The Pop PK population included data from 425 subjects (healthy volunteers and patients). Out of this 
data pool, 27 data points were excluded with a stated reason. 
Table 10: Covariates considered in the population PK analysis 
Covariate  data  from  triglycerides  and  CYP  phenotype  had  >10%  missing.  Covariate  data  collected  in 
the 7 studies with healthy subjects for triglycerides had 29.4% missing data and phenotype CYP2C19, 
CYP2C9  and  CYP3A5  data  had  35%  missing  data.  The  category  for  ultra-rapid  metabolisers  was 
represented for CYP2C19 (n=7). All other categories were represented by at least 5 subjects.

Figure 3: Prediction- and variability-corrected visual predictive check of final model 
The final model was a 2-compartment model, with mixed first order and, zero-order absorption and a 
time-dependent  induction  of  clearance.  The  VPCs  for  the  final  model  were  acceptable.  The  shrinkage 
on final parameters was high (>30%) for almost all PK parameters, which could have profound impact 
on the sequential PK/PD analyses. Sensitivity analysis of PPI-use  on ka showed  impact  of PPI-use  on 
exposure expressed as Cmax, but not AUC. This is in line with the results from study 1008 indicating a 
30% reduction on Cmax after PPI-use with no impact on AUC.

Table 11: Final model final parameter estimates 
The  sensitivity  analysis  of  various  covariate  effects  on  CL  showed  impact  from  body  weight  (BWT), 
TDOSE and WNCL,  but within the extended  boundary range  of 70-142.9%. This boundary range  was 
chosen as the area of no effect, based on results of the DDI study with itraconazole which resulted in a 
lorlatinib exposure increase of 42%.  
The sensitivity analysis of BWT influence  on CL  showed  a clear effect  where clearance  increased with 
body  weight.  Body  weights  in  the  studied  Pop  PK  population  ranged  from  31.8  to  155.5  kg  and 
exceeded the 10th and 90th percentiles interval.

Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis with lorlatinib clearance 
The  final  popPK  model  was  used  in  sequential  PK/PD  analyses,  to  evaluate  E-R  relationships  for 
efficacy and safety endpoints.  
Statistical methods 
Results were presented using descriptive statistics. Data were analysed after log-transformation using 
linear mixed effect statistical methods and the ratio of adjusted mean differences (test/reference) and 
associated 90% CIs were calculated for evaluation of effect. 
Absorption  
Lorlatinib is categorised as a BCS Class IV drug substance with pH-dependent solubility (10 mg/ml at 
pH <2 and 0.1 mg/ml at pH 7.7). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019

Median time to peak concentration, Tmax, was 1.2 hours following a single 100 mg dose and 2.0 hours 
following multiple daily doses of 100 mg lorlatinib in cancer patients. (Study 1001, Phase 2 and Japan 
LIC). 
Co-administration of agents that can affect gastric pH may potentially alter drug absorption, hence 100 
mg  lorlatinib  with  concomitant  treatment  of  rabeprazole  was  investigated  in  healthy  subjects  (study 
1008).  PK  results  are  presented  in  Table  12  showed  a  30%  decrease  in  Cmax  with  no  impact  on 
lorlatinib AUC. 
The potential for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP to transport lorlatinib was investigated  in vitro in 
transfected MDCKII cells with positive controls and the results indicated lorlatinib was not a substrate. 
Bioavailability 
Bioavailability of lorlatinib was studied in healthy volunteers in study 1005, 1007 and 1008.  
Comparison  of  IV  versus  oral  tablets  in  study  1007,  showed  the  mean  absolute  bioavailability  for 
lorlatinib  is  80.8%  (Table  12).  There  was  no  difference  in  the  exposure  of  the  major  metabolite  PF-
06895751 after oral administration of lorlatinib compared to IV. 
Table 12: Statistical summary of treatment comparison for lorlatinib pharmacokinetic 
parameters; Study 1007 
At 100 mg once daily, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV]) peak plasma concentration 
was  577  (42)  ng/ml  and  the  AUC24  was  5,650  (39)  ng·h/ml  in  patients  with  cancer.  The  geometric 
mean (% CV) oral clearance was 17.7 (39) L/h (Study 1001, Phase 2 and Japan LIC). 
Table 13: Pharmacokinetic parameters of lorlatinib at steady state in patients with ALK-
positive or ROS-1 positive NSCLC (study 1001) following administration of lorlatinib multiple 
oral doses (100 mg QD) 
Different  oral  formulations  of  lorlatinib  were  used  throughout  the  development  programme:  Form  1 
maleate salt formulation, Form 3 acetic acid solvate formulation and Form 7 anhydrous free base that 
was selected as commercial form of the drug substance.

Formulations  used  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  the  main  efficacy  study  in  patients  were  compared  in 
studies 1005 and 1016. Results indicated no clinically relevant exposure differences. For study 1005, it 
is of note, the geometric mean ratio of free base formulation compared to acetic acid solvate for Cmax 
was 85.13% with a 90%CI: 78.22-92.65, slightly below BE acceptance criteria of 80-125%.

Bioequivalence was shown between the free base clinical reference formulation and different strengths 
of the commercial image tablet in study 1016 (Figure 5).

Influence of food 
The influence of food was investigated in 6 patients in study 1001 and in 24 healthy subjects in study 
1008  (results  presented  in  Table  15).  Results  indicated  Tmax  was  slightly  prolonged  in  the  fed  state 
compared to the fasted in both study groups.

Table 15: Summary of plasma PF-06463922 PK parameter values following single oral doses 
Distribution 
The  apparent  volume  of  distribution of  lorlatinib  (Vz/F)  was  large  and  indicated  extensive  distribution 
into  tissues  (Table  15).  The  volume  of  distribution  of  the  major  metabolite  PF-06895751  was  not 
given. 
In  vitro  binding to  human  plasma  proteins  was  66%  (fu  of  0.340).  For  human  serum  albumin  (HSA) 
and for α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), fu was 0.474, and 0.620 respectively. Concentration dependency 
was not studied. The concentration investigated was >Cmax after multiple doses of lorlatinib 100 mg QD 
and within the dose proportional exposure range after QD 10 mg - 200 mg lorlatinib. Protein binding of 
PF-06895751  was  moderate  with  a  fu  of  0.207  in  human  plasma.  With  a  Cb/Cp  of  0.99,  lorlatinib 
distributes equally to whole blood and plasma. The blood-plasma ratio of the major metabolite was not 
determined. 
The ability of lorlatinib to cross the  BBB  was evaluated  in Study  1001.  CSF  concentrations and  time-
matched plasma concentrations of lorlatinib  were  available for 4 patients from  Phase  1 and 1 patient 
from Phase 2 and Japan LIC. Mean CSF/free plasma ratios were 0.7481 and 0.6791, respectively, for 
Phase  1  (n=4)  and  Phase  2  and  Japan  LIC  (n=1)  patients.  Therefore,  lorlatinib  can  cross  the  BBB 
following oral administration. CSF samples from treated patients were not analysed for PF-06895751. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
In cancer patients the plasma half-life of lorlatinib after a single 100 mg dose was 23.6 hours  (Study 
1001,  Phase  2  and  Japan  LIC).  The  plasma  half-life  of  lorlatinib  ranged  from  20.9  to  25.5  hr  across 
studies  and  was  close  to  tau  (QD  dosing).  Despite  the  long  half-life,  no  accumulation  of  lorlatinib 
occurred after multiple doses of the planned intended daily dose of 100 mg.   
In the human mass balance study (Study 1004) following oral administration of a 100 mg radiolabelled 
dose  of  lorlatinib,  the  urinary  excretion  of  unchanged  lorlatinib  was  found  to  be  a  minor  route  of 
elimination  with  less  than  1%  of  the  administered  parent  drug.  In  plasma  and  faeces,  lorlatinib 
accounted for 44.4% and 9.1% of total radioactivity respectively.

In the mass balance study, a mean 47.7% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 40.9% of the 
radioactivity  was  recovered  in  faeces,  with  an  overall  recovery  of  radioactivity  in  excreta  of  88.6%. 
Radioactivity  corresponding  to  64%  of  the  dose  was  identified  (estimated  including  metabolites 
observed  in  single  subjects).  In  plasma,  a  benzoic  acid  metabolite  of  lorlatinib  resulting  from  the 
oxidative  cleavage  of  the  amide  and  aromatic  ether  bonds  of  lorlatinib  was  observed  as  a  major 
metabolite  (PF-06895751),  accounting  for  21%  of  the  circulating  radioactivity.  A  follow-up  study 
(B7461017) with a different site of radiolabelling has been completed. 
The  major  human  metabolite  PF-06895751  was  not  detected  in  the  rat  or  dog  ADME  study.  PF-
06895751 was detected in plasma after repeat-dose administration of lorlatinib in the 13-week rat and 
dog  toxicity  studies,  at  levels  30-40  fold  below  the  mean  steady-state  exposure  in  humans  achieved 
after 100 mg QD lorlatinib. The observed exposure of PF-06895751 in humans is not covered by non-
clinical safety studies.

Figure 6: Proposed biotransformation pathways of lorlatinib in human excreta 
Inter-conversion 
Results from Study 1001 (n=6) indicated that no considerable chiral inversion of lorlatinib occurred in 
plasma. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The  metabolite  PF-06895751  was  considered  pharmacological  inactive  after  CEREP  screening.  There 
was inhibition of binding to GABAA1 of 30.9% at 10 µM, which is considered to be a weak to moderate 
effect.  The  tested  concentration  was  above  the  maximum  observed  plasma  concentration  of  PF-
06895751 in a patient (761 ng/mL at Cycle 10).

Figure 8: Linear and semi-log plots of median plasma concentration-time profiles of PF-06895751 
following administration of multiple oral 100 mg doses of lorlatinib in patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (study 1001) 
The  exposure  profile  of  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD  displayed  in  Figure  7  indicates  that  steady-state  was 
reached  at  Cycle  1,  Day  15  in  contrast  to  the  plasma  profile  for  PF-06895751  which  indicates  that 
steady-state was not reached (Figure 8)  at Cycle 1, Day 15. After a single 100 mg dose of lorlatinib, 
Tmax for PF-06895751 was ≥24 hours and the elimination seemed effective from 40 hours post-dose. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
The Pop PK model indicated that polymorphisms of the phenotypes  for CYP3A5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 
evaluated  as  poor,  intermediate,  extensive  or  ultra  metabolisers  (data  from  the  7  healthy  subject 
studies)  did  not  have  significant  impact  on  lorlatinib  exposure.  Ultra-rapid  metabolisers  were 
represented for CYP2C19. No data were collected from ultra-rapid metabolisers of CYP2C9. None of the 
investigated phenotypes represented major routes of elimination.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Figure 9: Log-Log plots of individual and geometric mean Cmax and AUCtau values of lorlatinib as a 
function of dose following administration of multiple QD doses of lorlatinib (Cycle 1 Day 15) (study 
1001) 
Data indicate a dose proportional increase in lorlatinib exposure expressed as Cmax and AUCtau over the 
investigated dose range of 10-200 mg QD, after single and multiple doses. Lorlatinib AUCtau seemed to 
increase less than dose-proportionally after 15 doses. 
The accumulation ratio for lorlatinib at steady-state was <1 even though the half-life was close to tau 
and indicated auto-induction of metabolising enzymes. This is in line with the increased metabolic ratio 
(AUCtau) of PF-06895751 to lorlatinib of 1.8 observed on Cycle 1, Day 15 after 100 mg QD.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The  inter-individual  variability  (CV%)  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  100  mg  QD  lorlatinib  in  healthy 
subjects across studies 1004, 1005, 1007, 1008, 1011, 1012 and 1016 ranged from 18-38% and 18-
37%,  for  Cmax  and  AUCinf  respectively.  Intra-individual  variability  between  first  and  last  dose 
evaluated in Study 1001, Phase 2 in patients, (N=19/22) was based on geometric mean after 100 mg 
QD and the %CV ranged from 36-39% and 40-42% for AUCtau and Cmax, respectively. Inter- and intra-
individual  variability  of  lorlatinib  PK  appear  to  be  moderate.  The  variability  was  slightly  higher  in 
patients after multiple doses compared to healthy subjects.

PK was evaluated in patients after single and multiple doses of lorlatinib after dose escalation and after 
long-term  administration  of  100  mg  QD  (4x25  mg).  The  PK  profile  of  lorlatinib  after  single  dose  was 
comparable  in  both  healthy  subject  and  patients.  Steady-state  was  reached  after  15  days  of  dosing, 
which was longer than expected from t½, but in line with the lack of accumulation and increased CL/F 
after  multiple  doses.  This  effect  caused  by  auto-induction  was  also  indicated  by  ratios  of  4β-
hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol and 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol that reached a maximum within 8 days.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Clearance  was  notably reduced in one patient with severe renal impairment. Renal function assessed 
as baseline creatinine clearance (WNCL), was found to be a statistically significant covariate affecting 
lorlatinib clearance in Pop PK analysis.

Hepatic impairment 
Impact  of  hepatic  impairment  on  lorlatinib  exposure  has  not  been  formally  studied.  Results  from  the 
patient  study  (Study  1001)  and  the  human  mass-balance  study  (Study  1004)  indicate  that  lorlatinib 
elimination primarily occurred via hepatobiliary elimination.

Gender 
In  the  Pop  PK  analysis,  gender  did  not  affect  lorlatinib  PK,  in  contrast  to  pre-clinical  findings  where 
gender  had  marked  effect  on  exposure.  Both  genders  were  represented  in  the  clinical  PK  studies. 
Women  represented  57%  of  the  studied  patient  Pop  PK  population.  The  studies  in  healthy  subjects 
were predominantly performed in males.  
Race 
Race was evaluated as Asian vs non-Asian in selected patients from Study 1001. No clinically relevant 
differences  were  observed.  Race  was  also  tested  as  a  covariate  in  Pop  PK  analysis  and  did  not  have 
significant effect on PK parameters. Half of the subjects in the clinical studies were white.

Weight 
Sensitivity analysis of body weight influence  on clearance  showed that clearance  increased with body 
weight. The sensitivity analysis simulating the concentrations following 100 mg QD administration with 
body weights at the 10th and 90th percentile extremes (corresponding to 50 and 91.3 kg) indicated no 
clinically relevant effect on exposure. Body weights in the studied Pop PK population ranged from 31.8 
to 155.5 kg.

Elderly 
In the studied Pop PK population (age 19 to 85), age did not seem to affect lorlatinib PK. Elderly  ≥65 
years  were  all  cancer  patients  from  Study  1001,  and  represented  approximately  14%  of  the  studied 
Pop PK population.

Lorlatinib PK was not studied in children. Lorlatinib is currently proposed indicated in adults only. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
The potential for lorlatinib to cause DDI was investigated in vitro. The results indicated lorlatinib could 
induce  CYP3A4,  CYP2B6,  activate  hPXR  and  hCAR1  and  inhibit  CYP3A4/5,  CYP2C9,  UGT1A1,  P-gp, 
BCRP (GI tract), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT3 and MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
The DDI effects identified in the in-vitro studies with possible clinical impact were further investigated 
in-vivo or in relevant cell lines (transporter studies). DDI caused by the major metabolite PF-06895751 
was tested in-vitro over a large range of concentrations. Interactions were found to be unlikely at the 
clinically relevant concentrations achieved after 100 mg QD Lorlatinib in patients.  
Interaction study with CYP3A4/5 inhibitor (Study 1012) 
The  effect  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  lorlatinib  (50 mg,  75 mg,  and  100 mg)  with  and  without  200 mg 
once  daily itraconazole was evaluated in a 2-way crossover  study in  16 healthy volunteers. Lorlatinib 
AUCinf increased by 42% and Cmax by 24%.

parameters with and without itraconazole

Interaction study with CYP3A4/5 inducer (Study 1011) 
Co-administration of 600 mg QD  rifampin decreased  lorlatinib exposure expressed as AUCinf  and Cmax 
by  85%  and  76%,  respectively  and  led  to  elevated  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels in all subjects, hence concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers with 
lorlatinib  are  contraindicated.  The  Applicant  advices  concomitant  use  of  moderate  CYP3A4/5  inducers 
with  lorlatinib  should  be  avoided.  The  metabolic  ratio  of  PF-06895751  increased  from  1.2  to  5.5  for 
AUCinf and from 0.21 to 1.1 for Cmax, following co-administration of lorlatinib and rifampin.

Interaction study with CYP3A4/5 substrate (Study 1001, Phase 1) 
The  effect  on  midazolam  exposure  after  co-administration  with  lorlatinib,  was  estimated  to  be 
decreases of AUCinf of 61% and 62% after 25 and 150 mg QD lorlatinib dosing and decreases in Cmax of 
40%  and  50%  after  25  mg  and  150  mg  QD  lorlatinib  dosing,  respectively,  compared  to  midazolam 
dosed alone. Co-administration with CYP3A4/5 substrates should be avoided. The study demonstrated 
that  lorlatinib  induced  a  reduction  in  oral  midazolam  exposure  (AUC)  which  classifies  lorlatinib  as  a 
moderate CYP3A inducer. 
Time-dependent CYP3A4/5 inhibition towards midazolam was demonstrated in vitro.

Interaction study with a PPI (Study 1008)  
Please refer to Table 15 in section “Absorption, Influence of food” for PK results. 
The effect of PPI use was evaluated in healthy subjects in Study 1008 and showed a 30% decrease in 
Cmax with no effect on AUC. 20 mg QD rabeprazole was used for evaluation of gastric effect. The effect 
of PPI use on lorlatinib exposure was statistically significant in Pop PK analyses. Bootstrap analysis of 
1000 simulated individuals showed some effect of PPI-use compared to without PPI-use. 
Ongoing 
In-vitro  studies  have  indicated  lorlatinib  has  potential  for  inhibition  of  CYP2C9,  UGT1A1,  P-gp  and 
induction  of  CYP2B6.  In-vivo  studies  with  specific  probe  substrates  are  ongoing  to  investigate  this 
further: a DDI study with the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide; a DDI study with the CYP2B6 substrate 
bupropion; a DDI study with a UGT substrate acetaminophen and a DDI study with the P-gp substrate 
fexofenadine.  Lorlatinib  may  have  the  potential  for  DDI  by  inhibiting  hepatic  transporters  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3,  OCT1,  and  renal  transporters  OAT3  and  MATE1  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations.  No  in 
vivo studies are planned to investigate this further.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The PK for lorlatinib was comparable between patients and healthy subjects with no apparent gender 
differences.  The  exposure  increased  linearly  with  dose,  however  multiple  dosing  resulted  in  an 
accumulation ratio close to 1 due to a time-dependent auto-induction of metabolising enzymes. Pop PK 
analysis indicated clearance increased with increasing weight. Simulation of weight extremes impact on 
plasma exposure did not describe the range of weight extremes observed in the study population.  
The  majority  of  mean  Ctrough  (pre-dose)  values  for  lorlatinib  ranged  from  70-125  ng/ml  (%CV  high), 
throughout EXP-1 to EXP-6 in the PK concentration population up to Cycle 20, Day 1.  
Peripheral neuropathy was observed in patients who received lorlatinib 100 mg QD.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Figure 11: Predicted steady-state plasma lorlatinib concentration-time profile following oral 
administration of lorlatinib 100 mg QD 
Dose rationale 
In  study  1001,  a  patient  treated  at  200  mg  QD  met  the  criteria  for  dose  limiting  toxicity  and  the 
majority  of  patients  had  treatment  emergent  adverse  effects  at  the  150  and  200  mg  QD  cohorts. 
Simulations  showed  that  100  mg  QD  dose  was  the  lowest  dose  that  would  exceed  the  effective 
concentration (Ceff) of 150 ng/ml to inhibit ALK G1202, for at least 8 hours, at steady-state. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The effect of lorlatinib on cardiac conduction was analysed in a non-clinical and in a clinical setting. A 
prolongation  of  PR  interval  was  observed  in  the  guinea  pig  heart  model  and  in  dog  at  a  dose  of 
15 mg/kg/day. These data were confirmed in the analysis conducted by iCardiac on data from clinical 
Study 1012 (Holter monitoring) in which a prolongation of PR interval was observed in lorlatinib alone 
(12.7 msec at 1 hour post-dose) and in lorlatinib+itraconazole (16.6 msec at 1.5 hour post-dose). No 
subjects  showed  a  PR  interval  >200  msec.  A  shortening  in  QTcF  interval  was  observed  1  hour  post 
lorlatinib dose and this effect was slightly more evident with itraconazole administration.

Figure 12: Change from baseline versus lorlatinib concentration 
PKPD analysis showed no relationship of lorlatinib concentration on heart rate or QTc prolongation but 
confirmed the shortening of QTcS or QTcF due to lorlatinib concentration. 
Increase in lorlatinib concentration was associated with PR prolongation and the baseline PR value was 
a predictor of PR prolongation. Simulations indicate the probability for PR intervals >200 msec is low.  
Study  1001,  Phase  2  further  evaluated  the  effects  of  lorlatinib  on  the  PR  interval  conducted  via 
continuous  Holter  telemetry  in  a  sub-group  of  patients.  Of  292  patients  in  the  100-mg  QD  pooled 
group, 29 patients with baseline PR <200 ms had PR prolongation 200-<220 ms while 11 patients with 
baseline  PR  <200  ms  had  prolonged  PR  >220  ms  after  treatment.  Seven  (7)  patients  with  PR  200-
<220 ms at baseline had prolonged PR >220 ms after treatment and 1 patient with baseline PR >220 
ms  had  PR  prolongation  ≥260  ms.  There  was  treatment-related  AV  block  (Grade  1)  reported  in  2 
patients  and  1  temporary  treatment  discontinuation.  The  sub-study  confirmed  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD 
treatment could cause PR-prolongation.

PD interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Predicted  effect  of  increasing  plasma  concentrations  of  lorlatinib  on  the  development  of  the  most 
frequently  occurring  AEs  have  been  investigated  appropriately  (see  below).  From  a  PD  perspective, 
clinical  management  in  the  event  of  lorlatinib-induced  AEs  belonging  to  the  SOCs  of  metabolic 
disorders,  CNS  disorders,  cardiac  disorders  and  other  AEs  has  been  appropriately  described  in  the 
SmPC.  It  is  noteworthy  that  all-causality  AEs  of  hypercholesterolemia  and  hypertriglyceridemia  were 
reported at a frequency of 82.4% and 60.7%. The  current SmPC  proposal contains a warning with a 
recommendation  to  monitor  plasma  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  In  the  event  that  concomitant 
medication  which  independently  increases  plasma  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  is  administered, 
synergistic  increases  may  be  expected.  However,  these  are  expected  to  be  captured  given  that  the 
current warnings and recommendations are followed. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
Analysis  of  ALK  kinase  domain  mutation  was  performed  in  plasma  and  in  tumour  tissue  in  cancer 
patients  from  Phase  2  of  Study  1001  to  investigate  the  impact  of  genetic  differences  with  regard  to 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibition  (data  not  shown).  Results  did  not  indicate  any  impact  of  the  ALK  kinase 
domain  mutation  or  of  the  G1202R  mutation  on  number  of  responders  or  duration  of  response 
compared to patients without detectable mutations in plasma and tumour tissue. Analysis for the ROS1 
kinase domain mutation had not been performed at the time of data cut off.   
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
No  exposure-response  relationship  of  efficacy  could  be  demonstrated  by  PK/PD  modelling,  using  the 
efficacy endpoints: objective response rate (ORR) and intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR) in 
patient data from  Study 1001. The effective concentration  Ceff  was determined to  be  150  ng/ml. The 
majority  of  patients  included  were  probably  exposed  well-above  this  cutoff.  90%  of  the  study 
population received 100 mg QD.  
In  Phase  1,  maximum  hypercholesterolemia  adverse  event  Grade  ≥2  (CHLGR)  was  found  to  be 
predictive of response. The Applicant suggested sensitivity to lorlatinib was a driver for response more 
than  exposure.  Asian  race  was  somehow  predictive  of  response  correlated  with  higher  baseline 
amylases (BAMY). Odds for achieving ORR or IC-ORR was found to be correlated with higher BAMY in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 64/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different  patient groups. Odds  of  achieving  ORR  was  lower  for  patients  with  1  and  2+  prior  systemic 
therapies.  Odds  of  achieving  IC-ORR  were  lower  for  patients  with  prior  CNS  radiation  and  higher 
baseline alkaline phosphatase (BAP).  
Relationship between plasma concentration and safety endpoints 
Baseline cholesterol, time on treatment and lorlatinib exposure were statistically significant predictors 
of  hypercholesterolemia  Grade  ≥3.  With  each  unit  increase  in  log(Cmax  event),  patients  were  5.256 
times  more  likely  to  experience  Hypercholesterolemia  Grade  ≥3.  Baseline  bodyweight  and  time  on 
treatment were significant predictors of Weight  Gain  Grade  ≥2. Asian  ethnicity, baseline triglycerides 
and time of treatment were significant predictors of Hypertriglyceridemia Grade ≥3. Age, concomitant 
use  or  narcotics  and  steroids,  time  on  treatment  and  lorlatinib  exposure  were  statistically  significant 
predictors of TEAEs Grade ≥3. 
The frequency of the CNS endpoints in the investigated population were too low to allow for a robust 
analysis, however it seemed lorlatinib exposure was not predictive of CNS effects when the majority of 
the studied population received 100 mg QD. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the bioanalytical method validations and PK analysis are considered thorough and acceptable 
according  to  guidelines.  The  Pop  PK  population  included  data  from  425  subjects  (healthy  volunteers 
and patients). Although the model underestimates the exposure around Cmax after a single dose, model 
performance at steady state in cancer patients is in general considered acceptable. 
Peak  lorlatinib  concentrations  in  plasma  are  rapidly  reached  with  the  median  Tmax  of  1.2 hours 
following a single 100 mg dose and 2.0 hours following multiple dosing of 100 mg once daily.  
After  oral  administration  of  lorlatinib  tablets,  the  mean  absolute  bioavailability  is  80.8%  (90%  CI: 
75.7, 86.2) compared to intravenous administration. 
Administration of lorlatinib with a high fat, high calorie meal resulted in 5% higher exposure compared 
to fasted conditions. Lorlatinib may be administered with or without food.  
At 100 mg once daily, the geometric mean (%CV) peak plasma concentration was 577 (42) ng/ml and 
the AUC24 was 5,650 (39) ng·h/ml in patients with cancer. The geometric mean (% CV) oral clearance 
was 17.7 (39) L/h. 
In vitro binding of lorlatinib to human plasma proteins is 66% with moderate binding to albumin or to 
α1-acid glycoprotein.  
In  humans,  lorlatinib  undergoes  oxidation  and  glucuronidation  as  the  primary  metabolic  pathways. 
In vitro  data  indicate  that  lorlatinib  is  metabolised  primarily  by  CYP3A4  and  UGT1A4,  with  minor 
contribution from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5 and UGT1A3.  
In  plasma,  a  benzoic  acid  metabolite  of  lorlatinib  resulting  from  the  oxidative  cleavage  of  the  amide 
and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib was observed as a major metabolite, accounting for 21% of the 
circulating radioactivity. This oxidative cleavage metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. 
The  plasma  half-life  of  lorlatinib  after  a  single  100 mg  dose  was  23.6 hours.  Following  oral 
administration  of  a  100 mg  radiolabelled  dose  of  lorlatinib,  a  mean  47.7%  of  the  radioactivity  was 
recovered  in  urine  and  40.9%  of  the  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  faeces,  with  overall  mean  total 
recovery of 88.6%.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 65/148 
 
 
 
 
Unchanged lorlatinib was the major component of human plasma and faeces, accounting for 44% and 
9.1% of total radioactivity, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged lorlatinib was detected in urine.  
At single dose, lorlatinib systemic exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) increased in a dose-related manner over 
the 10 to 200 mg dose range. Few data are available over the 10 to 200 mg dose range; however, no 
deviation from linearity was observed for AUCinf and Cmax after single dose. 
At  steady-state,  the  systemic  exposure  (AUC24)  increased  less  than  proportionally  over  the  10  to 
200 mg dose range. 
Also,  at  steady-state  lorlatinib  plasma  exposures  are  lower  than  those  expected  from  single  dose 
pharmacokinetics, indicative of a net time-dependent auto-induction effect.  
As  lorlatinib  is  metabolised  in  the  liver,  hepatic  impairment  is  likely  to  increase  lorlatinib  plasma 
concentrations. Clinical studies that were conducted excluded patients with AST or ALT > 2.5 × ULN, or 
if  due  to  underlying  malignancy,  > 5.0 × ULN  or  with  total  bilirubin  > 1.5 × ULN.  Population 
pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that lorlatinib exposure was not clinically meaningfully altered in 
patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (n = 50).  No  dose  adjustments  are  recommended  for  patients 
with mild hepatic impairment. No information is available for patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Less  than  1%  of  the  administered  dose  is  detected  as  unchanged  lorlatinib  in  urine.  Population 
pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that lorlatinib exposure was not clinically meaningfully altered in 
patients  with  mild  (n = 103)  or  moderate  (n = 41)  renal  impairment  (CLcr > 30  ml/min).  No  starting 
dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Information 
for lorlatinib use in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min) is limited (n = 1). 
The  applicant  will  submit  the  results  of  studies  investigating  the  use  of  lorlatinib  in  patients  with 
hepatic (Study B7461009) and renal (Study B7461010) impairments (see RMP). 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with advanced NSCLC and healthy volunteers indicate 
that  there  are  no  clinically  relevant  effects  of  age,  gender,  race,  body  weight,  and  phenotypes  for 
CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. 
The  in-vitro  interaction  studies  indicated  that  lorlatinib  could  induce  CYP3A4,  CYP2B6  mediated  by 
hPXR  and  hCAR1.  Until  final  results  of  DDI  studies  with  CYP2C9,  CYP2B6,  UGT1A1,  and  P-gp  are 
available,  substrates  of  CYP2C9,  CYP2B6,  UGT1A1,  and  P-gp  should  be  avoided.  This  information  is 
mentioned  in  the  SmPC  Section 4.5  with  an  amended  list  of  medicinal  products  with  a  narrow 
therapeutic index.  
The in-vitro results also indicated that lorlatinib could inhibit CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, P-gp, BCRP 
(GI tract), OATP1B1, OATP1B3,  OCT1, OAT3, and MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In-vivo 
studies  with  specific  probe  substrates  for  CYP2C9,  CYP2B6,  UGT1A1  and  P-gp  are  ongoing  to 
investigate  this  further.  No  in  vivo  DDI  studies  with  inhibition  of  OATP1B1-3,  OCT1  or  OAT3  are 
planned.  Potential  interactions  with  substrates  of  OATP1B1-3,  OCT1  or  OAT3  are  not  expected  to  be 
clinically relevant.  
Itraconazole,  a  strong  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4/5,  administered  at  oral  doses  of  200 mg  once  daily  for 
5 days,  increased  the  mean  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  42%  and  Cmax  24% of  a  single 100 mg oral 
dose of lorlatinib in healthy volunteers. Concomitant administration of lorlatinib with strong CYP3A4/5 
inhibitors  (e.g.  boceprevir,  cobicistat,  itraconazole,  ketoconazole,  posaconazole,  troleandomycin, 
voriconazole, ritonavir, paritaprevir in combination with ritonavir and ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir, and 
ritonavir  in  combination  with  either  elvitegravir,  indinavir,  lopinavir  or  tipranavir)  may  increase 
lorlatinib plasma concentrations. Grapefruit products may also increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations 
and  should  be  avoided.  An  alternative  concomitant  medicinal  product  with  less  potential  to  inhibit 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 66/148 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4/5 should be considered. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be concomitantly administered, a 
dose reduction of lorlatinib is recommended (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC).  
Rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, administered at oral doses of 600 mg once daily for 12 days, 
reduced the mean lorlatinib AUC by 85% and Cmax by 76% of a single 100 mg oral dose of lorlatinib in 
healthy  volunteers;  increases  in  AST  and  ALT  were  also  observed.  Concomitant  administration  of 
lorlatinib  with  strong  CYP3A4/5  inducers  (e.g.  rifampicin,  carbamazepine,  enzalutamide,  mitotane, 
phenytoin  and  St.  John’s  wort)  may  decrease  lorlatinib  plasma  concentrations.  The  use  of  a  strong 
CYP3A4/5 inducer with lorlatinib is contraindicated. Concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers 
should  be  avoided,  if  possible,  as  they  may  also  reduce  lorlatinib  plasma  concentrations  (see 
Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
In vitro studies indicated that lorlatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of CYP3A4/5 
and  it  activates  the  human  pregnane-X-receptor  (PXR),  with  the  net  effect  in  vivo  being  induction. 
Concurrent  administration  of  lorlatinib  in  patients  resulted  in  decreased  oral  midazolam  AUC  when 
midazolam  was  administered  alone,  suggesting  that  lorlatinib  is  an  inducer  of  CYP3A4/5.  Lorlatinib 
150 mg  orally  once  daily  for  15 days  decreased  AUCinf  and  Cmax  of  a  single  oral  2 mg  dose  of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) by 61% by 50%, respectively; hence, lorlatinib is a moderate 
CYP3A  inducer.  Thus,  concurrent  administration  of  lorlatinib  with  CYP3A4/5  substrates  with  narrow 
therapeutic indices, including but not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
fentanyl,  hormonal  contraceptives,  pimozide,  quinidine,  sirolimus  and  tacrolimus,  should  be  avoided 
since the concentration of these medicinal products may be reduced by lorlatinib (see Sections 4.4 and 
4.5 of the SmPC). 
The ongoing DDI studies (sub-study of B7461001) with CYP2C9, P-gp, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1 substrates 
are  performed  following  15  days  of  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD  dosing,  i.e.  at  steady-state,  which  is 
considered  a  sufficiently  long  period  to  cover  the  full  induction  potential.  Results  from  the  ongoing 
interactions  studies  will  be  included  in  the  final  CSR.  The  applicant  is  recommended  to  provide  a 
summary of the PK data from the DDI sub-study in patients. 
The rationale behind the daily dosing interval of 100 mg QD lorlatinib is adequately described.  
In the clinical Study 1012 a prolongation of the PR interval was observed via Holter monitoring. PKPD 
simulations  indicated  the  probability  for  PR  intervals  >200  msec  is  low.  Study  B7461001,  Phase  2 
evaluated  the  effects  of  lorlatinib  on  the  PR  interval  conducted  via  continuous  Holter  telemetry  in  a 
sub-group  of  patients.  The  sub-study  confirmed  lorlatinib  100  mg  QD  treatment  could  cause  PR-
prolongation.  The  prolongation  of  PR  interval  occurred  in  a  concentration  dependent  manner.  There 
was  treatment-related  AV  block  (Grade  1)  reported  in  2  patients  and  1  temporary  treatment 
discontinuation. Adequate guidance is provided in Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC.  
ALK kinase domain mutation analysis was performed in plasma and in tumour tissue in cancer patients 
from  Phase  2  of  Study  1001  to  investigate  the  impact  of  genetic  differences  with  regard  to  tyrosine 
kinase inhibition. Results indicated no impact of ALK kinase domain mutation or G1202R mutation on 
number  of  responders  or  duration  of  response  compared  to  patients  without  detectable  mutations  in 
plasma and tumour tissue.  
The  exposure-response  relationship  was  analysed  for  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints.  No  exposure-
response relationship was identified between any lorlatinib exposure metric (Cmax,P1, Ctrough,P1, Cavg,P1, as 
such or as its logarithmic value) and ORR or IC-ORR. Lorlatinib exposure was a statistically significant 
predictor of hypercholesterolemia Grade ≥3 and of TEAEs Grade ≥3. Age, concomitant use or narcotics 
and  steroids,  time  on  treatment  and  lorlatinib  exposure  were  statistically  significant  predictors  of 
TEAEs  Grade  ≥3.  Adequate  guidance  for  adverse  reactions  is  provided  in  SmPC  Section  4.2  and  4.4. 
The rate of CNS endpoints in the investigated population were too low to allow for a robust analysis. 
Assessment report

No  statistically  significant  exposure-safety  relationship  was  found  for  any  of  the  CNS-related  safety 
endpoints. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, bioanalytical methods and the PK analysis were acceptable. The PK of lorlatinib is adequately 
described and the in vitro and in vivo interaction studies in healthy subjects and patients are 
considered acceptable. 
The applicant will submit the following measures post authorisation to address remaining uncertainties 
in relation to pharmacology: 
- In order to further investigate the effect of lorlatinib on patients with renal and hepatic impairment, 
the applicant should submit the results of studies B7461010 and B7461009 (see RMP) 
- In order to further characterise the full induction potential of lorlatinib on CYP2C9, P-gp, CYP2B6 and 
UGT1A1 substrates, the applicant is recommended to provide a summary of the PK data from the DDI 
sub-study in patients 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical study that provides the basis for the efficacy evaluations of lorlatinib consists of 2 portions, 
Phase 1  and  Phase  2.  Data  from  this  study  were  initially  based  on  the  data  cutoff  date  of  15  March 
2017, at which time the study was ongoing, but enrollment in both Phases was complete.  During the 
procedure, updated efficacy results were provided with data cutoff date of 02 February 2018, allowing 
for a median follow-up of 9.9 months of the pooled cohorts EXP-4 and 5. Efficacy results are presented 
for 41 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC from the Phase 1 portion of Study 1001 and for 197 
patients  with  advanced  ALK-positive  NSCLC  from  the  Phase  2  portion  of  Study  1001,  as  well  as  2 
Japanese patients in the Japan LIC.

In  the  dose-escalation  Phase  1  portion  of  the  1001  study,  the  optimal  dosing  of  lorlatinib  was 
established. The MTD was not reached as only 1 patient met the dose-limiting criteria. This patient was 
treated with lorlatinib at 200 mg QD and did not receive 16 of the planned 21 doses of lorlatinib during 
Cycle  1  due  to  toxicities  attributed  to  study  drug,  which  met  the  protocol  definition  of  a  DLT.  This 
patient  experienced  Grade 1  and  Grade  2  CNS  effects  during  Cycle  1,  including  Grade  2  aphasia  and 
cognitive disorder, and Grade 1 visual impairment and abnormal dreams, so lorlatinib was temporarily 
discontinued  for  the  remainder  of  the  cycle.  Additionally,  in  the  150  mg  QD and 200 mg  QD  cohorts, 
the majority of patients experienced AEs resulting in temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction. 
At  150  mg  QD,  these  included  temporary  discontinuations  for  Hallucination  (in  2  patients  Grade  2), 
Confusional  state  (1  patient  Grade  2),  Mental  status  changes  (1  patient  Grade  3),  and  Seizure  (1 
patient  Grade  2).  At  200  mg  QD,  in  addition  to  the  patient  with  the  DLT,  temporary  discontinuation 
included  1  additional  patient  who  experienced  Formication  and  Irritability  (Grade  1  and  Grade  2, 
respectively). As a result, it was agreed upon by the Sponsor and the Phase 1 Investigators to evaluate 
doses  lower  than  200  mg  QD  and  consider  an  alternative  dosing  regimen.  BID  dosing  was 
subsequently evaluated to assess whether reducing the Cmax would lessen the CNS effects. Patients did 
not  tolerate  75  mg  or  100 mg  BID  dosing.  Thus,  while  the  MTD  was  not  formally  reached,  lorlatinib 
was considered tolerable at the 100 mg QD dose level, which was declared the recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC.

AEs that in the investigator’ judgment did not constitute a safety risk for the patient. 
11. Serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative at Screening (before the 
patient was allowed to receive the investigational product [IP]). A patient was of childbearing potential 
if, in the opinion of the investigator, she was biologically capable of having children and was sexually 
active.

Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study was to evaluate overall (intra- and extra-
cranial) and intracranial anti-tumour activity of single-agent lorlatinib at RP2D in patients with 
advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
 
 
 
To confirm the safety and tolerability of single-agent lorlatinib at the RP2D. 
To confirm single- and multiple-dose PK profiles of single-agent lorlatinib at the RP2D. 
To assess secondary measures of clinical efficacy. 
To detect early signs of changes in mood, cognitive function, or suicidal ideation and behaviour 
(SIB). 
 
To evaluate PRO of global QoL, functioning and the impact of lorlatinib on disease/treatment-
related symptoms of lung cancer at the RP2D. 
 
 
To further evaluate the effects of single-agent lorlatinib at the RP2D on the QTc interval. 
To further evaluate tumour and blood-based molecular markers of response and resistance to 
single-agent lorlatinib at the RP2D. 
 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-agent crizotinib following lorlatinib in treatment-
naïve patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. 
 
To evaluate response to prior systemic therapies. 
Exploratory Objective 
The exploratory objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study was to explore the brain penetration of 
single-agent lorlatinib at the RP2D. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
  ORR was defined as the percent of patients with Best Overall Response (BOR) of confirmed 
Complete Response (CR) or confirmed Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. 
Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging at least 4 weeks after the initial 
documentation of response. 
 
Intracranial ORR (IC ORR) was defined as the percent of patients with CNS metastases at study 
entry with Best Overall Intracranial Response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR (considering only 
the lesions having brain as the disease site).  
Secondary endpoints: 
 
TTR (IC TTR) was defined as the time from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to first documentation of 
objective (intracranial) tumour response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed.   
  DOR (IC DOR) was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective (intracranial) 
tumour response, CR or PR, to the first documentation of disease progression or death associated 
with any cause, whichever occurs first.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 74/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from C1D1 to first documentation of 
objective disease progression or to death on study due to any cause, whichever came first. If 
tumour progression data include more than 1 date, the first date will be used.  
  Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from C1D1 to the date of death due to any cause.  
 
Probabilities of survival at 1 year and 18 months were defined as the probabilities of survival at 1 
year and 18 months, respectively, after the date of first dose. 
Other analyses conducted in Phase 2 included Disagreement in Response assessment, PROs based on 
EORTC QLQ C30 (Version 3.0) and its lung cancer module, QLQ LC13, and Biomarker analyses. 
Sample size 
The  Phase  2  study  was  initially  designed  to  recruit  240  patients  with  40  patients  in  each  of  the  6 
cohorts.  There  was  no  sample  size  definition  based  on  either  expected  desirable  outcomes  or  a  pre-
specified precision of the estimates for the hypothesised ORR, as demonstrated by the large width of 
the 95% CI listed in the table below, showing possible estimated ORR and 95% CIs for different level 
of responses in populations of 30, 40 patients, 70 and 80 patients. 
Therefore, data only allow for descriptive statistics of results to be made. 
Randomisation 
The study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was not blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all enrolled patients with documented ALK gene 
rearrangement who were treated with at least 1 dose of lorlatinib. The ITT Analysis Set is the primary 
efficacy analysis set and is the focus of the efficacy presentations in this SCE.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 75/148 
 
 
 
 
 
With the goal of increasing the precision of efficacy endpoints estimation, an additional analysis set 
(100mg QD pooled group), that was not pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), comprised 
all 215 previously treated patients with purported ALK-positive NSCLC who received the RP2D of 
lorlatinib 100 mg QD as a starting dose in the study (Phase 2, n=198). 
The safety analysis set included all enrolled patients treated with at least 1 dose of lorlatinib 
(including the Day -7 lorlatinib dose). 
PRO-evaluable analysis set is defined as all patients in the safety analysis set who completed a 
baseline and at least 1 post-baseline PRO assessment. The PRO-evaluable analysis set is the primary 
population for the analysis of change from baseline for PRO assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-
LC13). 
The following biomarker analysis sets were defined:  
a) CNA Peripheral Blood Analysis Set: defined as all patients of the ITT analysis set who had at least 1 
molecular biomarker (analyte mutation) assayed,  
b) Paired CNA Peripheral Blood Set: defined as all patients in the ITT analysis set who had valid paired 
results from at least 1 molecular biomarker (analyte mutation) assayed at Screening and post-
treatment (i.e., EOT for Phase 2),  
c) Tumour Tissue Analysis Set: defined as all patients in the ITT analysis set who had at least 1 
molecular tumour biomarker assayed from either the screening archival or screening de novo tumour 
biopsy sample (or both), 
d) Paired Tumour De Novo Analysis Set: defined as all patients in the ITT analysis set who had both 1) 
either archival tumour tissue or de novo biopsy at Screening, and 2) an EOT de novo biopsy with at 
least 1 molecular tumour biomarker assayed.

Overall Survival  
In  Phase  2,  the  updated  median  duration  of  follow-up  for  OS  was  approximately  20  months  for  the 
cohorts EXP-3B:EXP-5.  
In cohort EXP-3B, the median OS was 21.1 months (95% CI: 12.3, NR) and 60.7% patients were still 
censored  for  OS.  Most  patients  14  (50.0%)  were  alive  and  in  follow  up  at  the  data  cutoff  date.  The 
survival probability for EXP-3B at 12 months was 69.8% (95% CI: 48.5, 83.6) and at 18 months was 
61.6% (95% CI: 40.2, 77.2). 
In  pooled  cohort  EXP-4:EXP-5,  the  median  OS  for  the  111  ALK-positive  NSCLC  patients  was  19.2 
months (95% CI: 15.4, NR). A total of 55 (49.5%) patients were censored for OS. Most patients were 
censored 47 (42.3%) because they were alive at the data cutoff date. The survival probability for EXP-
4:EXP-5 at 12 months was 67.3% (95% CI: 57.6, 75.4) and at 18 months was 54.2% (95% CI: 44.0, 
63.2).

Time to Tumour Progression 
The  median  TTP  based  on  independent  assessment  was  11  months  (95%CI:  8.2,  13.7)  overall,  9.0 
months for cohort EXP-3 (95%CI: 5.5, NR), 8.4 months for cohort EXP-4 (95%CI: 5.6, 13.7), and 7.1 
months (95%CI: 4.1, 12.5) for cohort EXP-5.  
Comparison between TTP on lorlatinib and the TTP on last treatment prior to lorlatinib 
For  patients  who  had  received  ALK-inhibitor  treatment  prior  to  lorlatinib,  the  median  TTP  was  12.9 
months (95%CI: 11.2, 18.1) for cohort EXP-3, 12.1 months (95%CI: 7.9, 16.4) for cohort EXP-4, and 
3.7  months  (95%CI:  2.1,  6.6)  for  cohort  EXP-5.  The  corresponding  hazard  ratios  (lorlatinib  versus 
prior therapy) were 0.572 (95%CI: 0.324, 1.010) for EXP-3, 0.757 (95%CI: 0.489, 1.173) for EXP-4, 
and 0.628 (95%CI: 0.382, 1.034) for EXP-5. 
For  patients  who  had  received  systemic  therapy other  than  ALK-TKI  treatment  prior  to lorlatinib,  the 
median TTP was 8.5 months (95%CI: 5.0, 12.6) for EXP-3, 5.0 months (95%CI: 3.1, 10.8) for cohort 
EXP-4,  and  5.6  months  (95%CI:  4.7,  11.2)  for  cohort  EXP-5.  The  corresponding  hazard  ratios 
(lorlatinib versus prior therapy) were 0.314 (95%CI:  0.086, 1.148) for EXP-3,  0.745 (95%CI: 0.357, 
1.552) for EXP-4, and 0.886 (95%CI: 0.398, 1.972) for EXP-5. 
Data were not provided specifically for cohort EXP-3B. 
During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  information  on  TTP  on  last  treatment 
prior  to  lorlatinib  as  grouped  by  first  and  second-generation  ALK  inhibitors  in  cohorts  EXP-3:EXP-5, 
with data provided by both individual cohorts (including EXP-3B) and pooled analysis (data not shown). 
No significant differences were observed in terms of TTP between lorlatinib and prior ALK-TKI. 
Intracranial Time to Tumour Progression 
The median IC-TTP based on independent assessment was not reached (95% CI: 6.9, NR) for cohort 
EXP-3, 15.7 months (95%CI: 11.0, 15.7) for cohort EXP-4, and NR (95% CI: 8.3, NR) for cohort EXP-

Biomarker assessments 
Plasma  biospecimens  were  available  from  at  least  93%  of  the  patients  in  each  of  the  ALK-positive 
expansion cohorts (EXP-2:EXP-5), for a total of 190 (96.4%).  
Plasma CNA samples were analysed for ALK gene rearrangements and kinase domain mutations by 
NGS. Patients in EXP-3B were not analysed separately. The ALK gene rearrangement and ALK kinase 
domain mutation data and sample disposition are summarised in Table 55. 
Of  note,  lorlatinib  exhibited  antitumor  activity  across  a  variety  of  ALK  kinase  domain  resistance 
mutations, including the well characterised L1196M and G1269A crizotinib resistance mutations as well 
as the difficult-to-treat G1202R/G1202del mutations, but also in rarer, newly identified mutations such 
as P1329S.

Supportive study 
Phase 1 part of study B7461001 
Patients  included  in  the  Phase  1  part  had  advanced  ALK/ROS1-positive  NSCLC  and  were  either 
treatment-naïve or experienced disease progression after prior ALK-TKI and any prior chemotherapy.  
Thirty-two (32; 59.3%) female patients and 22 (40.7%) male patients were enrolled in Phase 1, and 
the  mean  age  was  51.9  years  old.  Most  patients  enrolled  were  White  (68.5%).  Only  17  patients 
received  the  relevant  dose  (100  mg  QD).  Fifty-two  (52;96.3%)  Phase  1  patients  received  prior 
systemic  therapy in  any  treatment  setting  and  2  patients  (3.7%)  were  treatment  naïve  (i.e.  no  prior 
chemotherapy in the metastatic disease setting and no prior ALK or ROS1 inhibitor therapy). Of those 
patients  who  received  prior  systemic  therapy,  48/52  patients  received  at  least  1  prior  ALK  or  ROS1 
TKI. Thirty-five (35;64.8%) patients had prior surgery and 35 (64.8%) had radiation therapy.

The ORR was 39%  (95%CI:  24.2-55.5) in  the 41 patients  with  ALK-positive NSCLC,  and  furthermore 
22%  of  these  patients  had  stable  disease.  In  the  CNS,  the  ORR  by  IRC  was  also  clinically  relevant 
41.2% (95%CI: 24.6-53.3) in this setting.

Time to tumour response 
Among  the  16  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  with  a  confirmed  objective  tumour  response  by 
independent assessment, the median TTR was 1.4 months (range: 1.2 to 15.2). Among the 6 patients 
with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  with  a  confirmed  objective  tumour  response  by  independent  assessment, 
the median TTR was 1.4 months (range: 1.2 to 2.8). The median TTR by investigator assessment was 
similar to independent assessment for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and the same for patients with 
ROS1-positive NSCLC. 
For  patients  with  baseline  CNS  metastases  and  a  confirmed  objective  response  by  independent 
assessment, the median IC-TTR was 1.4 months (range: 1.2 to 20.1) among the 14 patients with ALK-
positive NSCLC and 1.4 months (range: 1.1 to 2.8) among the 4 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. 
The analysis included both measurable and non-measurable disease. 
DOR 
The  median  follow-up  time  for  DOR  by  IRC  was  27.8  months  (95%CI:  20.4,  31.8)  for  patients  with 
ALK-positive NSCLC. 
The duration of response  in the  CNS  for  Phase  1 patients with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  was 14.1  months 
(95%CI:  4.17,  NR)  with  50%  of  patients  censored.  The  median  intracranial  DOR  could  not  be

as well.

A total of 26 patients (49.1%) died during Phase 1. The survival probability, for the total population, at 
12 and 18 months was 62.7% (95%CI: 47.9, 74.4) and 56.6% (95%CI: 41.9, 69.0). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed therapeutic dose was identified in Phase 1, based on a combination of toxicity 
parameters, mechanism-based PK/PD modelling and also taking into account the pre-clinical anti-
tumour activity of lorlatinib against the ALK mutation G1202, which is known to confer resistance to 
both crizotinib and the second generation ALK-inhibitors alectinib and ceritinib. The approach used for 
RP2D selection is endorsed. However, other relevant ALK-resistance mutations have been identified for 
ceritinib (L1152R and F1174C/V) or alectinib (I1171N/T/S) [Muller et al. Onco Targets Ther. 2017; 10: 
4535–4541] against which lorlatinib has not been tested in vitro using a PK/PD modelling-based 
approach. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  efficacy  assessment  is  based  on  the  ongoing  Phase  1/2  Study  1001.  In  the  Phase  2  part,  228 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC were included in various cohorts according to prior treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 104/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The amendments and protocol violations in the study are deemed unlikely to have had relevant impact 
on the integrity of study. 
The design of the dose escalation study is considered acceptable and standard for a Phase 1 oncology 
study. The recommended dose of lorlatinib is 100  mg QD  orally, and the rationale behind the clinical 
dose setting and dosing interval has been adequately described and justified. The aims of the Phase 2 
part were both efficacy (ORR) and safety, including Patient-related Outcomes (PROs). 
Patient  demographics  were  representative  of  an  ALK-positive  NSCLC  patient  population.  Most  of  the 
patients  enrolled  in  the  Phase  2  part  were  white  (48%)  or  Asian  (37.5%)  and  the  age  and  gender 
distribution was as could be expected, i.e. a mean age of 53.6 years and 57.1% were female patients. 
Only 45/334 (13.5%) of patients recruited, were aged >65 years, reflecting that the targeted patient 
population  is  generally  younger  due  to  the  demographics  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC  and  the  study 
population are considered to be reflective of the patient population regarding age. 
Data was not collected regarding smoking history and response. Other studies with ALK-inhibitors have 
shown some relationship between baseline smoking status and ORR, and although the efficacy was not 
absent, it seemed to be diminished in patients who were current smokers. The Applicant did not collect 
data  on  smoking  in  the  pivotal  study,  but  are  doing  so  in  the  ongoing  Phase  3  study  and  this  is 
acceptable.  The  ECOG  performance  status  at  baseline  was  0-1  in  96.2%  of  the  cases  in  the  Phase  1 
part and 96.4% of the cases in the Phase 2 part. This is considered to be expected in the early clinical 
trial setting, however, more patients with PS 2 are expected in the target population. 
The pre-treatment varied a lot between the cohorts and this is now reflected in the final wording of the 
indication.  For  example,  newly  presented  data  from  the  EXP-4  and  EXP-5  cohorts  show  that  the 
majority of patients had received prior crizotinib. For the applied indication, results from the EXP-3B to 
EXP-5  cohort  are  considered  relevant  and  comprises  139  patients.  It  is  noted  that  the  cohort  EXP-
4:EXP-5  enrolled  a  high  number  of  patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline  (75%),  which  is  both 
considered representative of the possible target population and endorsed because efficacy in the CNS 
can be demonstrated. Overall, the study population is representative of a heavily pre-treated group of 
NSCLC patients, who became unresponsive to currently available ALK-inhibitors and, therefore, reflects 
an unmet medical need that can be recognised in clinical practice.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  Phase  2  part  was  ORR  by  IRC  (RECIST  1.1),  while  this  endpoint  was 
exploratory  for the  Phase  1  part. However, it is noted that  the  ORR  was 39% (95%CI: 24.2-55.5)  in 
the 41 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in the Phase 1 study, and furthermore 22% of these patients 
had stable disease. In the CNS, a similar ORR was observed, which is considered clinically relevant in 
this setting. The ORR by IRC in the Phase 2 part was 42.9% (95%CI: 24.5-62.8) in EXP-3B and 39.6% 
(95%CI: 30.5-49.4) in EXP-4:EXP-5. In addition, approximately a third of the patients in both cohorts 
had stable disease. These results are not outstanding but within an expectable range, considering that 
the  ORRs  for  other  ALK  inhibitors  are  around  50%  in  the  second-line  setting  and  that  the  ORR 
generally drops down through the lines of therapy. The magnitude of this effect is difficult to interpret 
in the absence of a comparator; however, the ability to induce complete remission, although in a very 
small fraction of subjects, is noted. 
Regarding concordance  rates,  the response  disagreement between ICR and Investigator assessments 
is  around  20%  for  some  EXP-groups.  Differences  are  observed  in  most  of  the  response  categories, 
which compromise the robustness of data and seem larger in the assessment of CNS metastases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 105/148 
 
 
 
 
In the CNS, the ORR by IRC was also showing clinically relevant efficacy, even in the later lines of ALK-
inhibition  therapy.  It  is  noted  that  only  few  patients  progressed  in  the  CNS  on  lorlatinib  and  a 
stabilisation of CNS disease is also considered highly clinically relevant in this patient population. In the 
Phase  1  part,  the  overall  discordance  rate  for  objective  overall  response  was  20.8%  and  23.8%  for 
intracranial  responses.  In  the  Phase  2  part,  the  overall  discordance  rate  was  16.4%  and  29.6%  for 
intracranial responses. These discordance rates are surprisingly high, especially for the assessment of 
intracranial response in the Phase 2 part of the study, and the applicant suggests that differences may 
be  related  to  different  approaches  between  local  radiologists  and  ICR  to  the  imaging  assessment; 
rather than providing a reassuring explanation. 
Another  source  of  uncertainty  in  evaluating  IC  ORR  results  is  prior  radiotherapy,  since  the  lapsed 
period required between the end of radiotherapy and study entry was only 2 weeks for stereotactic or 
small field brain irradiation and 4 weeks for whole brain radiation. However, data submitted comparing 
IC-ORR  in  the  efficacy  population  (pooled  EXP-3B,  EXP-4,  EXP-5)  for  all  patients,  and  excluding 
patients with an interval from the end of radiation and the start of lorlatinib treatment <8 weeks and 
<12 weeks, respectively excluded this bias (data not shown). 
Plots  of  the  cumulative incidence  function of  CNS  progression,  non-CNS  progression,  and  death  have 
been  provided.  In  all  analyses,  patients  receiving  RT  for  brain  metastases  up  to  8  weeks  before 
lorlatinib  were  excluded.  In  the  pooled  EXP-3B:EXP-5  population,  incidence  of  non-CNS  progression 
was  more  frequently  observed  than  CNS  progression  when  considering  all  patient  groups  (overall 
efficacy  population,  patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline,  patients  without  brain  metastases  at 
baseline).  On  the  contrary,  in  the  EXP-3B  cohort,  CNS  progression  had  a  higher  incidence  than  non-
CNS  progression.  The  interpretation  of  these  data  in  the  context  of  a  single  arm  trial  is  intrinsically 
limited, and need confirmation in a larger cohort, as planned. 
The initial data cutoff was 15 March 2017 and results from an updated data cutoff (02 February 2018) 
have been provided during the procedure with a median duration of follow-up for OS of approximately 
20 months in the relevant cohorts. Median PFS with matured data was similar to the prior data cutoff 
and  still  considered  clinically  meaningful.  A  confirmatory  randomised  Phase  3  study  is  ongoing, 
comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lorlatinib  to  crizotinib  in  the  first-line  setting  and  from  updated 
timelines, it is evident that the CSR is at the earliest expected by Q4 2021. The applicant is planning to 
randomise  280  patients  in  total  and  so  far  approximately  240  of  the  planned  patients  have  been 
randomised,  hence,  full  enrollment  will  be  expected  and  final  CSR  should  be  available  by  the  end  of 
2021. 
The proposed confirmatory study is considered acceptable to complete a comprehensive evidence base 
in respect of safety and confirm the overall efficacy of lorlatinib. In addition, the applicant will conduct 
a single-arm efficacy study assessing lorlatinib in the second-line setting after disease progression on 
alectinib  or  ceritinib,  as  the  CHMP  considers  that  there  are  no  standard  of  care  in  this  setting.  This 
single-arm efficacy study will confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib in the proposed second-line setting post 
second generation ALK inhibitors and this study is added to the already proposed confirmatory study of 
efficacy of lorlatinib in the first-line setting as a special obligation.  
Overall,  it  is  considered  that  mechanisms  of  on-target  resistance  to  second-generation  ALK-i  as 
conferred  by  ALK-mutations  subsequent  to  treatment  are  expected  to  develop  regardless  of  lines  of 
therapy, making the EXP-4:EXP-5 cohorts supportive of the EXP-3B data. The applicant has showed a 
similar therapeutic activity of lorlatinib in 2L post 2nd generation ALKi and 3L post crizotinib in the first 
line and a 2nd generation ALKi as 2L in terms of ORR and DOR, as well as a comparable response rate 
across  the  different  cohorts,  when  data  were  analysed  by  ALK-mutational  status,  demonstrating 
benefit of lorlatinib and it’s potential to satisfy the requirement for fulfilment of the unmet clinical need 
in both settings. Considering that the main limitation of the data supporting the 2L currently resides in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 106/148 
 
 
 
 
the limited sample size of EXP-3B (n=28 vs the 111 patients in EXP-4:EXP-5) the proposed PAES with 
consequent  enlargement  of  the  population  of  EXP-3B  is  regarded  as  confirmatory  of  the  preliminary 
efficacy data in this population.  
Among the secondary endpoints was time to response (TTP), which was approximately 1.4 months and 
similar  in  both  the  Phase  1  and  2  parts  of  the  study.  The  responses  were  equally  rapid  in  the  CNS, 
demonstrating  clinically  relevant  efficacy  in  this  patient  population  with  a  high  frequency  of  brain 
metastases. Median DOR in Phase 1 was 14.1 months, and 12.5 months and 7.0 months in the EXP-4 
and  EXP-5  cohorts  respectively.  In  the  CNS,  DOR  results  from  the  EXP  4:EXP-5  cohort  show 
encouraging results with a median DOR of 12.4 months. Median PFS in the  Phase 1 was 5.3 months, 
but the CIs are wide. PFS data from Phase 2 have matured, and show clinically relevant results for the 
EXP-4:EXP-5  cohorts  (6.9  months  (95%CI:  5.4,  9.5).  In  addition,  OS  data  from  Phase  2  have  also 
matured and a median OS of ~20 months in the relevant cohorts are also considered clinically relevant 
and no obvious selection bias of the results were observed. 
The PRO results from the Phase 1 part were generally in line with the Phase 2 results. It is noted that 
many  common  cancer  symptoms  were  significantly  reduced  on  treatment  but  also  that  peripheral 
neuropathy  at  the  following  time  points:  Cycles  3  to  14,  16,  and  33  was  worsened  clinically 
significantly.  PRO  results  from  the  Phase  2  part  showed  similar  improvements  in  the  general  cancer 
symptoms  fatigue,  pain,  insomnia,  and  appetite  loss.  Approximately  a  third  of  the  patients  had 
worsening  of  peripheral  neuropathy.  Overall,  PRO  results  is  considered  to  reflect  clinical  benefit  of 
lorlatinib and no obvious detrimental effect on QoL was observed. 
A  trend  for  lower  activity  in  non-Asian  patients  was  reported,  however  available  data,  including  PK 
data, are too limited to draw any definitive conclusion (see Section 5.1 of the SmPC). The applicant will 
further  investigate  this  observation  in  the  B7461006  Clinical  Study  Report  (see  Annex  II),  in  which 
ethnic origin (Asian vs non-Asian) constitutes a randomisation factor.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Although a positive benefit-risk profile can be concluded, the data have limitations inherent to the non-
comparative nature of the pivotal studies supporting the recommendation for a conditional MA. The 
applicant will submit the results of a Phase 3 study investigating lorlatinib versus crizotinib in the first 
line setting (CROWN study) which will further confirm the overall efficacy and safety of lorlatinib in 
ALK-positive NSCLC. Only 28 patients were included in the cohort EXP-3B including patients who have 
progressed after a second generation ALK inhibitors used as a first line treatment. As a consequence 
further data are needed to confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib in that setting and the applicant agreed to 
conduct a prospective observational single arm study to confirm the observed results from EXP-3B.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The data from the pivotal 1001 study show clinically relevant efficacy of lorlatinib in a variation of 
cohorts according to prior treatments and this has been reflected in the final wording of the indication. 
The preliminary but clinically relevant efficacy of lorlatinib in the proposed second-line setting can be 
confirmed by a post-authorisation efficacy study.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the overall efficacy of lorlatinib in the treatment of patients with ALK-
positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study CROWN (1006) 
comparing lorlatinib versus crizotinib for the first-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. The 
clinical study report will be submitted by 31 December 2021. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 107/148 
 
 
 
 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib in patients who progressed after alectinib or 
ceritinib as the first ALK-TKI therapy, the MAH should conduct a prospective single arm study 
investigating patients in that same setting. The clinical study report will be submitted by 30 June 2024. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
One  clinical  ongoing  Phase  1/2  study  with  lorlatinib  100  mg  orally  once  daily  (QD)  including  adult 
patients  with  ALK-positive  or  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  was  conducted  and  forms  the  basis  of  the  safety 
evaluation. This clinical study consists of 2 portions, Phase 1 and Phase 2: 
• 
The Phase 1 portion of the study was designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
for single-agent lorlatinib and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). All treated patients 
(N=54) were included in the safety analysis set. The median duration of lorlatinib treatment in Phase 1 
was 10.2 months. 
• 
The  Phase  2  portion  of  the  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  anticancer  activity  of  single-
agent  lorlatinib  at  the  identified  RP2D  from  Phase  1  in  multiple  subpopulations  of  patients  based  on 
ALK/ROS1  status  and  number  of  prior  therapies.  All  treated  patients  (N=275)  were  included  in  the 
safety analysis set. The updated median duration of treatment in Phase 2 was 16.33 months.

cutoff date: 02 February 2018 
Overall  in  the  100-mg  QD  pooled  group  (n=295),  76.3%  of  patients  were treated  with  lipid-lowering 
therapy  only;  however, 
in  19.0%  and  38.4%  of  subjects  with  hypercholesterolemia  or 
hypertriglyceridemia respectively, the AE did not resolve.  
The  median  time  to  increased  levels  of  cholesterol  values  of  500  mg/dL  or  higher  and  blood 
triglycerides values of 1,000 mg/dl or higher was 201 days (range 42 – 518 days) and 127 days (range

Peripheral neuropathy 
Table 80: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Peripheral Neuropathy Adverse Events by 
MedDRA Preferred Term and Maximum CTCAE Grade by Decreasing Order of Frequency (All 
Cycles, all causality) (100-mg QD Pooled Group) - All-causality and Treatment-related - 
Safety Population - Data cutoff date: 02 February 2018 
Events  of  neuropathy  were  frequent  both  in  Phase  1  and  2,  however,  high-grade  events  were  rare. 
Median time to PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY was 85  days (range, 1-723) and the  median duration was 
258  days  (range  1-1041)  in  the  100mg  group.  Updated  data  showed  a  small  increase  of  treatment-
related AEs. 
Central nervous system (CNS) effects 
Events  of  cognitive  effects  were  frequent  in  all  grades  in  the  Phase  1  part  and  most  events  were 
considered  treatment-related.  Even  though  high-grade  events  were  rare,  a  quarter  of  the  patients 
were affected and many PTs were used.  
An analysis of CNS effects was submitted identifying 4 defined patient populations: 
- Group A 
Patients who reported any Grade (1-4) of Cognitive Effects AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 115/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Subgroup A1  Patients who reported maximum Grade 1 or 2 of Cognitive Effects AEs. 
- Subgroup A2  Patients who reported maximum Grade 3 or 4 of Cognitive Effects AEs. 
- Group B 
Patients who reported no Cognitive Effects AEs (control group). 
Patients for whom cognitive effect adverse events were reported were not systematically evaluated for 
radiological alterations, as the focus of the radiological evaluation  was on  changes in  tumour  growth. 
There were no spontaneous reports of radiological alterations in patients with cognitive effect adverse 
events. 
BL*- Baseline is defined as the last PRO assessment prior to first dose, which could be day -7 or C1D1 window. The visit label and 
visit windows are applied for the analysis of the PRO endpoints. In the case of multiple records for a patient within a particular visit 
window, then use the assessment which is closest to the target day. Group A is defined as patients who reported any Grade(1-4) of 
Cognitive Effects AEs. Group B is defined as patients who reported no Cognitive Effects AEs. N1 and N2 are numbers of subjects at 
risk for Group A and B respectively. It is defined as the number of subjects who completed the scale at baseline and at the 
respective cycle. A questionnaire is considered complete if at least one question is answered regardless of whether DONE/NOT DONE 
is checked in the CRF page. Mean Change (+/-) SE was truncated to be in [-100,100]. Figures drawn on a scale of [-100,100] to 
show trends. In the unlikely event that both (or all) the records are equidistant from the target day the patient's last assessment 
within that visit window was used.

% = (n/N)*100. n is the number of distinct patients who met the scale change criterion. N is the number of subjects in PRO 
population with mean scale scores. A Questionnaire is considered complete if at least one question is answered regardless of 
whether DONE/NOT DONE is checked in the CRF page. In the case of multiple records for a patient within a particular visit window, 
use the assessment which is closest to the target day. In the unlikely event that both (or all) the records are equidistant from the 
target day, use the patient’s last assessment within that visit window. [1]In the functioning scales improvement is defined as an 
increase of at least 10 points. [2]Not improved nor worsened will be considered ’stable’. [3]Worsening is defined as a decrease of at 
least 10 points. Group A is defined as patients who reported any Grade(1-4) of Cognitive Effects AEs. Group A1 is defined as 
patients who reported maximum Grade 1 or 2 of Cognitive Effects AEs. Group A2 is defined as patients who reported maximum 
Grade 3 or 4 of Cognitive Effects AEs. Group B is defined as patients who reported no Cognitive Effects AEs.

The  median  time  to  onset  was  42  days  (range,  1-727).  No  patients  permanently  discontinued 
treatment  associated  with  this  event.  One  patient  required  a  dose  reduction  and  subsequently  a 
temporary treatment discontinuation for a second event of Dysarthria. 
Cumulative lorlatinib exposure seems to increase the risk of COGNITIVE EFFECTS AEs, as revealed by 
the increasing AEs proportions over time.

Phase 1 
A total of 12/54 (22.2%) patients had all-causality Weight increased with a median time to first onset 
of 104 days (Range: 8-559). The median duration was 371 days, most events were  Grade 1 (9.3%), 
Grade  2  (5.6%)  or  Grade  3  (7.4%)  in  severity  and  none  required  temporary  discontinuation  or  dose 
reduction. No patients permanently discontinued treatment. Ten (10; 18.5%) patients had treatment-
related  AEs,  none  were  Grade  4,  3  were  Grade  3  and  the  remainder  was  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity. 
There  were  19  (35.2%)  patients  with  a  weight  increase  of  10  -  20%,  and  9  (16.7%)  patients  with

Median  time  to  first  onset  was  71  days  (range:  1-731).  The  median  duration  was  100  days  and  1 
patient  had  a  Grade  3  event.  No  SAEs  or  permanent  discontinuations  were  observed.  No  clinically 
relevant differences were observed with updated data.  
Liver tests increased 
100-mg QD Pooled Group  
A total of 43/295 (14.6%) patients had AST increased (Grade 3: 2[0.7%] patients, Grade 4: 2 [0.7%] 
patients),  40  (13.6%)  patients  had  ALT  increased  (Grade  3:  3[1.0%]  patients,  Grade  4:  2  [0.7%] 
patient),  5  (1.7%)  patients  had  Blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased  (Grade  3:2  patients  [0.7%], 
Grade 4: none), 2 (0.7%) patients had Hepatic function abnormal. The majority of these events were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity. None of these AEs resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. Of note, 
1 patient had a Grade 1 AE (treatment-related) of Hepatocellular injury. Some of the patients (<2% in 
each  AE  category)  required  dose  reductions  or  temporary  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  of  liver  tests 
increased. The 2 patients who had liver test increased related SAEs are described above, the additional 
patients  in  this  pooled  group  did  not  result  in  further  SAEs.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were 
observed with updated data. 
Liver toxicity resulting in liver tests was considered within an acceptable range and the events do not 
seem dose-dependent.

QTc prolongation 
Table 87: Shift Summary of Maximum Absolute QTcF or QTcB (100-mg QD Pooled Group) - 
Safety Population – Data cutoff date: 02 February 2018 
Five  (5) patients  (1.8%)  had  a  change  in  QTcF  from  baseline  > 60 msec.  It  has  been  observed  that 
lorlatinib  induced  QTc  prolongation  with  a  common  frequency  (5.4%  of  drug-related  events  in  the 
pooled  100  mg  QD  dataset;  1  patient  (0.4%)  with  a  shift  from  normal  baseline  QT  interval  to  QTcF 
>500 msec post-baseline (Grade 3 AE) whose causality cannot be ruled out).  
Interstitial lung disease or Pneumonitis 
100-mg QD Pooled Group  
Interstitial  lung  disease/pneumonitis  was  reported  in  4  patients.  The  AE  of  Interstitial  lung  disease 
(Grade  3)  was  reported  in  1  (0.3%)  patient  and  the  AE  of  Pneumonitis  was  reported  in 
3 (1.0%) patients  (1  each  at  Grade  2,  3  and  4).  Lorlatinib  was  discontinued  permanently  due  to  the 
Grade 4  AE  of  Pneumonitis  (treatment-related)  for  1  patient.  The  1  patient  with  Grade  3  AE  of 
Interstitial  lung  disease  (treatment-related)  required  temporary  discontinuation  of  lorlatinib.  No 
patients required temporary discontinuations or dose reductions due to AE of Pneumonitis. Except the 
Grade 4 AE of Pneumonitis and Grade 3 AE of Interstitial lung disease, no other AEs of Interstitial lung 
disease or Pneumonitis were reported as treatment-related. SAEs were Grade 3 and 4 Pneumonitis and 
Grade 3 Interstitial lung disease. Updated data contains no new cases of ILD or pneumonitis. 
Pneumonitis  is  a  class  effect  of  ALK-inhibitors  but  is  not  a  frequent  event  with  lorlatinib.  No  patients 
died due to this event, which was manageable with dose reductions or discontinuations.  
Atrioventricular block 
In  healthy  volunteer  studies,  no  AEs  associated  with  AV  block  were  reported,  however  PR  interval 
prolongation was observed. 
100-mg QD Pooled Group 
In  295 patients  who  received  lorlatinib  at  the  recommended  dose  of  100 mg  once  daily  and  had  an 
ECG  measurement  in  Study  1001,  the  maximum  mean  change  from  baseline  for  PR  interval  was 
16.4 ms  (2-sided  90%  upper  CI  19.4 ms).  Of  these,  7 patients  had  a  baseline  PR  > 200 ms.  Among 
Assessment report

the 284 patients with PR interval < 200 ms, 14% had PR interval prolongation ≥200 ms after starting 
lorlatinib. 
Table 88: Shift Summary of Maximum Absolute PR Results (100-mg QD Pooled Group) - 
Safety Population - Data cutoff date: 02 February 2018 
AV  block  first  degree  was  reported  in  2  patients  (both  at  Grade 1;  treatment-related),  and  AV  block 
complete was reported by 1 (0.3%) patient (Grade 3, not treatment-related). The median duration for 
AV block first degree was 141 days. The AV block complete occurred in 2 days. There was 1 temporary 
treatment  discontinuation  associated  with  the  Grade  3  event.  No  other  patients  required  a  dose 
reduction or temporary discontinuations, or  permanent treatment discontinuations in association  with 
atrioventricular block. No new case of AV block was observed with updated data. 
Higher  frequencies  of  “PR  prolonged  AE”  has  been  observed  with  increasing  duration  of  baseline  PR 
interval.  
Pancreatitis 
100-mg QD Pooled Group  
One  (1/295)  (0.3%)  patient  had  an  AE  of  Pancreatitis.  This  patient  had  a  treatment-related  SAE 
(Grade  3)  from  Cycle  3  Day  20,  due  to  which  the  study  treatment  was  temporarily  discontinued.  On 
Cycle  3  Day  21,  the  AE  was  considered  resolved  but  another  non-serious  AE  of  pancreatic  enzymes 
increased (Grade 1) was reported and while study treatment resumed, it was given at a reduced dose. 
Lipase  increased  was  reported  in  10.8%  of  patients  and  Amylase  increased  was  reported  in  8.5%  of 
patients. There were no additional cases of pancreatitis with updated data.

A  total  of  7  (13%)  of  54  patients  died  on  study  treatment  or  within  28  days  of  their  last  dose  of 
lorlatinib, and 20 (37.0%) patients died after 28 days of their last dose of lorlatinib; none of the deaths 
were treatment-related. Six (6) of 7 deaths, on study treatment or within 28 days, were due to disease 
progression  and  1  death  due  to  Hypoxia  (supplemental  oxygen  dependency).  Among  the  27  deaths, 
the majority (24) died due to the disease progression, 1 patient died due to “other” causes specified as 
hypertension, supplemental oxygen dependency, morbid obesity and diabetes, and 2 patients died due 
to an unknown cause.   
Phase 2 
Out  of  275  patients,  26  (9.5%)  died  on  study  treatment  or  within  28  days  of  their  last  dose  of 
lorlatinib, and 38 (13.8%) patients died after 28 days of their last dose of lorlatinib; none of the deaths 
were  treatment-related.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  death  was  disease  progression  (59  patients 
(21.5%).  Four  (4)  patients  died  due  to  “other”  causes,  and  specific  reasons  included  pneumonia  (2 
patients)  probable  lung  infection  (1  patient),  and  suspected  thrombus  embolism  (1  patient);  none  of 
which were considered treatment-related. One patient died due to an unknown cause.

There were more AEs of all causality in patients older than 65 years e.g. anaemia, oedema, dyspnoea, 
fatigue, arthralgia, and back pain. On the other hand, some incidences of AEs are lower in the elderly 
population however the number of patients aged 65 years was rather limited.

associated with dose reductions (100 mg QD pooled group) safety population - Data cutoff 
date: 2 February 2018 
Approximately half of the patients in the 100-mg group experienced temporary dose discontinuations, 
most frequently due to oedema, hypertriglyceridemia and neuropathy. Almost a quarter of the patients 
were dose reduced due to treatment-related AEs.  
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprises 332 patients, and of these, 295 patients received the proposed dose for 
marketing  (100mg  QD).  The  median  duration  of  treatment  was  10.2  months  in  Phase  1  and 
approximately 16 months in the Phase 2 patients. All patients experienced at least one AE, and most of 
these 
were 
treatment-related. 
The 
most 
common 
TEAEs 
were 
hyper-
cholesteremia/hypertriglyceridemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy,  fatigue,  cognitive  and  mood 
effects,  dyspnoea,  and  increased  weight.  The  most  common  Grade  3-4  events  were  also 
hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia.  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  include  hyperlipidaemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy,  CNS 
effects, weight gain, vision disorders, etc.  
The  risk  of  increases  in  serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  is  relatively  high  with  lorlatinib  and  more 
than 80% of the patients in Phase 2/100-mg group were treated medically. Median time of occurrence 
of  severe  increase  in  serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  is  201 days  (range:  42  to  518 days)  and 
127 days  (range:  15  to  358 days),  respectively.  Serum  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  should  be 
monitored  before  initiation  of  lorlatinib;  2, 4  and  8 weeks  after  initiating  lorlatinib;  and  regularly 
thereafter.  Lipid-lowering  medicinal  products  should  be  initiated  or  their  dose  increased,  if  indicated 
(see Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
CNS effects have been observed in patients receiving lorlatinib, including changes in cognitive function, 
mood or speech (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).  The risk of an event is less frequent in the 
Phase 2 part and these events may therefore be dose- and exposure related. Despite the relatively low 
rate  of  Grade  3  events,  the  impact  of  the  reported  cognitive  disorders  (neurological  and  psychiatric) 
may  be  important  for  the  patient’s  quality  of  life.  Such  events  included  confusion,  delirium,  mental 
impairment, amnesia, dementia, disturbance in attention, etc., which are considered clinically relevant 
also at a Grade 2 of severity. Their impact on patient’s quality of life was discussed by the Applicant, 
however  as  CNS  effects  and  their  origin  are  very  complex  and  challenging  both  to  diagnose  and 
evaluate the degree of impact on patient functioning may be equally difficult to assess. CNS effects are 
an identified risk in the RMP and will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. Dose modification or 
Assessment report

discontinuation may be required for those patients who develop CNS effects (see Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Lorlatinib  was  studied  in  a  population  of  patients  that  excluded  those  with  second-degree  or 
third-degree  AV  block  (unless  paced)  or  any  AV  block  with  PR  interval  > 220 msec.  PR  interval 
prolongation and AV block have been reported in patients receiving lorlatinib. ECG should be monitored 
prior to initiating lorlatinib and monthly thereafter, particularly in patients with predisposing conditions 
to the occurrence of clinically significant cardiac events. Dose  modification may be required for  those 
patients  who  develop  PR  prolongation  or  AV  block  (see  Sections 4.2,  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC).  AV 
block is identified as an important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been reported in patients receiving lorlatinib who 
had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. Based on the available clinical trial data, it is 
not possible to determine a causal relationship between effects on changes in cardiac contractility and 
lorlatinib. In patients with cardiac risk factors  and  those  with  conditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac 
monitoring,  including  LVEF  assessment  at  baseline  and  during  treatment,  should  be  considered.  In 
patients who develop relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring, including 
LVEF assessment should be considered. 
Elevations  of  lipase  and/or  amylase  have  occurred  in  patients  receiving  lorlatinib.  Median  time  of 
occurrence  of  increase  in  serum  lipase  and  amylase  is  70 days  (range:  7  to  696 days)  and  41 days 
(range:  7  to  489 days),  respectively.  Risk  of  pancreatitis  should  be  considered  in  patients  receiving 
lorlatinib  due  to  concomitant  hypertriglyceridemia  and/or  a  potential  intrinsic  mechanism.  Patients 
should  be  monitored  for  lipase  and  amylase  elevations  prior  to  the  start  of  lorlatinib  treatment  and 
regularly thereafter as clinically indicated (see Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
Severe or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with ILD/pneumonitis have occurred 
with  lorlatinib.  Any  patient  who  presents  with  worsening  of  respiratory  symptoms  indicative  of 
ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. dyspnoea, cough and fever) should be promptly evaluated for ILD/pneumonitis. 
Lorlatinib should be withheld and/or permanently discontinued based on severity (see Sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In Phase 1, 27 patients have died, and no deaths were considered treatment-related. In Phase 2, 30 
patients died and although none of the deaths were considered treatment-related, after a clarification, 
2  deaths  were  re-categorised  as  death  from  disease  progression  and  one  death  remains  due  to 
unknown causes. 
Most  of  the  SAEs  are  cases  of  disease  progression,  or  due  to  other  known  risks  associated  with 
disseminated  cancer-disease  such  as  pulmonary  embolism  and  super  vena  cava  syndrome  that  are 
present in an expected number for this patient population.  
There was generally more toxicity in non-Asian patients and clinically significant differences regarding 
hypertriglyceridemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy,  cognitive  and  mood  effects,  increased  weight, 
fatigue, and anaemia. This result correlates with other findings in clinical trials; however, although all 
causality  treatment-emergent  AEs  showed  a  similar  incidence  among  Asian  and  non-Asian  patients 
(99.1% versus 100%), the Grade 3-4 or Grade 5 adverse events were found respectively in 57.4% and 
12.0% in the Asian group versus 48.4% and 14.9% in the non-Asian group. The greatest differences in 
incidence among the 2 race groups was found for: fatigue (Asian 7.4% versus non-Asian 36.6%), and 
anaemia  (Asian  6.5%  versus  non-Asian  21.7%).  Only  minor  differences  in  all  causality  AEs  were 
observed for Phase 1 and Phase 2 receiving RP2D after stratification by race and cumulating all cycles 
with regards to incidence or to severity.

Less than 10% of the patients discontinued lorlatinib permanently, but it is noted that only a third of 
the discontinuations were assessed to be due to treatment-related AEs and these AEs were mostly 
related to cognitive effects, even at the 100 mg dose. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
There are inherent limitations to the interpretation of the safety profile based on a single arm non-
comparative trial. The safety data from the ongoing controlled Phase 3 CROWN study (1006) will be 
important to further characterise the safety profile of lorlatinib post authorisation (see Annex II). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  lorlatinib  is  in  line  with  what  could  be  expected  from  an  ALK-inhibitor.  Most 
toxicities were clinically manageable with dose modifications, and only few uncertainties regarding the 
safety  profile  remain  (see  SmPC  and  RMP).  The  ongoing  confirmatory  Phase  3  trial  is  expected  to 
provide  comprehensive  evidence  in  respect  to  safety,  in  particular,  regarding  the  CNS  effects.  The 
discontinuation  rate  was  below  10%  and  is  considered  relatively  low  and  acceptable  in  the  palliative 
setting. Overall, the safety profile of lorlatinib is manageable and in line with other ALK-inhibitors. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the safety of lorlatinib in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study CROWN (1006) 
comparing lorlatinib versus crizotinib for the first-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. The 
clinical study report will be submitted by 31 December 2021.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) considered that the risk 
management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The  requirements  for  submission  of  periodic  safety  update  reports  for  this  medicinal  product  are  set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the Periodic

Safety Update Report (PSUR) cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.09.2018. The 
new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  compared  the  structure  of  lorlatinib  with  active  substances  contained  in  authorised 
medicinal  products  in  the  European  Union  and  declared  that  it  is  not  a  salt,  ester,  ether,  isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers lorlatinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Lorviqua  (lorlatinib)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as: 
 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)] 
Therefore  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is as follows:   
“Lorlatinib  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  anaplastic  lymphoma 
kinase  (ALK)  positive  advanced  non  small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  whose  disease  has  progressed 
after: 
• 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 138/148 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI”.  
The aim of therapy is to prolong survival and improve overall response rate (ORR), especially for in the 
CNS, as brain metastases are a major clinical problem in this patient population. The primary endpoint 
of the pivotal trial is ORR by investigator and can be considered an early surrogate for clinical benefit. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
ALK-inhibitors are currently the main treatment options for ALK-positive NSCLC. The first ALK inhibitor 
to  be  approved  was  crizotinib  in  2012,  but  since  then  alectinib  and  ceritinib  have  been  approved  as 
first- and second-line therapies.  
There is an unmet medical need for further targeted therapy in patients who have already received the 
approved ALK-inhibitors (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) as few treatment options are available once 
patients become resistant to approved therapies. Currently, there are no standard of care for patients 
in  the  second-line  after  alectinib  or  ceritinib  nor  in  the  third-  or  later  line  setting  as  treatment  with 
chemotherapy has a very modest efficacy  in both settings in addition to poor penetrance to the CNS. 
There  is  a  particular  need  for  therapies  active  in  the  CNS,  as  brain  metastases  is  a  major  clinical 
problem in this patient population, reflected by an incidence of brain metastases of 75% of patients in 
cohort  EXP-4  and  5  of  the  pivotal  study.  Therefore  there  is  a  high  unmet  medical  need  for  further 
treatment  options  in  patients  with  CNS  metastases.  The  data  is  currently  limited  on  the  use  of 
checkpoint  inhibitors  in  the  second-  and  third  line  setting  (small  sample  sizes)  in  patients  with  ALK-
positive  NSCLC  and  represented  in  small  subgroups  of  larger  randomised  trials.  In  addition,  the 
efficacy  results  with  immunotherapy  are  not  of  high  clinical  relevance  in  this  setting.  In  conclusion, 
there is currently no effective standard of care for patients neither in the proposed second-line setting 
after alectinib or ceritinib nor in the third-or later line setting. 
The unmet medical need also includes prevention of CNS metastases as this is a potential risk for all 
patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, who have received available targeted therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data  from  a  pivotal  Phase  1-2  study  are  provided.  Both  parts  of  the  study  were  open-label,  non-
randomised, single-arm study with no comparator. In the Phase 1 part, 41 patients were included, and 
in the  Phase  2 part, 197 patients with  ALK-positive NSCLC were  included  across 5 cohorts. However, 
the relevant study population for the  sought indication were  cohort  3B-5,  which consisted of patients 
with:  
  Diagnosis of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC; 
 
Previously treated with a prior second-generation ALK-TKI with or without chemotherapy (EXP-
3B); 
 
Previously treated with 2 or more ALK-TKIs (pooled cohorts EXP-4 and EXP-5) 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary  endpoint:  Confirmed  ORR  by  IRC  was  42.9%  (95%CI:  54.5,  62.8)  in  cohort  EXP-3B  and 
among patients treated with 2 or 3 prior ALK-TKIs (pooled cohort EXP-4:EXP-5), the ORR was 38.7% 
(95%CI:  29.6,  48.5).  Per  cohort,  the  ORRs  were  41.5%  (CI  29.4,  54.4)  in  EXP-4  and  37.0%  (23.2, 
52.5) in EXP-5. A partial response was obtained in 39.3% in cohort EXP-3B and 37.8% in cohort EXP-
4-5, while complete responses were observed in 3.6% and 1.8% of the patients, respectively.

Key secondary endpoints: Intracranial ORR by  IRC, and results are  also presented by cohort. Among 
the 9 patients with baseline brain metastases in EXP-3B, the IC ORR was 66.7% (95%CI: 29.9, 92.5) 
and  among  the  48  patients  with  baseline  brain  metastases  in  EXP-4:EXP-5,  the  IC  ORR  was  52.1% 
(95%CI: 37.2, 66.7). The CR/PR rates were  22.2/44.4% and 20.8/31.3%, respectively. Two patients 
(22.2%) and 8.3% of the patients from these subgroups, respectively, had progressive disease and no 
and 35.4%, respectively, had stable disease.  
Median duration of response was 5.6 months (4.17-NR) in cohort EXP-3B and 9.9 months (5.65-24.44) 
in  the  pooled  cohorts  EXP-4  and  5,  while  time  to  tumour  response  were  approximately  1.4  months 
across the cohorts. Median PFS by ICR was 5.5 months (95%CI: 2.9, 8.2) for EXP-3B and 6.9 months 
(95%CI:  5.4,  9.5)  for  EXP-4:EXP-5.  The  median  OS  for  the  28  patients  with  ALK-positive  NSCLC  in 
EXP-3B  was  19.5  months  (95%CI:  18.3,  21.0)  while  it  was  20.5  months  (95%CI:  19.6,  23.3  for 
EXP-4:EXP-5.   
There were no detrimental effects on quality of life in the pivotal study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although  the  results  from  the  presented  study  are  considered  mature,  they  are  not  considered 
comprehensive as based on uncontrolled data with limited sample size. Thus confirmatory studies are 
needed. 
The ongoing confirmatory  Phase 3 study compares lorlatinib to crizotinib in the first-line treatment of 
ALK-positive  NSCLC  and  results  will  be  available  by  Q4  2021.  This  proposed  confirmatory  study  is 
considered  acceptable  for  confirming  the  overall  efficacy  and  safety  of  lorlatinib.  In  view  of  the 
preliminary  evidence  for  the  benefit  of  lorlatinib  in  the  proposed  second-line  setting  in  patients 
progressing  on/resistant  to  currently  approved  second-generation  ALK-inhibitors,  an  observational 
efficacy study adequately powered to confirm the observed results in the limited sample size from EXP-
3B will be conducted as a specific obligation to the CMA. The PAES will confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib 
in  the  second-line  setting  after  disease  progression  on  alectinib  or  ceritinib.  The  primary  endpoint  is 
ORR, the estimated sample size is 70 patients, and the results will be available in Q2 2024. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All of the patients experienced at least one  AE,  and  most  of  these  were treatment-related. The most 
common  TEAEs  were  hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy, 
fatigue,  cognitive  and  mood  effects,  dyspnoea,  and  increased  weight.  The  most  common  Grade  3-4 
events were also hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia.  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  include  hyperlipidaemia,  oedema,  peripheral  neuropathy,  CNS 
effects, weight gain, and vision disorders.  
Less than 10% of the patients discontinued lorlatinib permanently, but it is noted that only a third of 
the  discontinuations  were  assessed  to  be  treatment-related  and  these  AEs  were  mostly  related  to 
cognitive effects, even at the 100 mg dose.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  are  inherent  limitations  to  the  interpretation  of  the  safety  profile  based  on  a  single  arm  non-
comparative trial. The safety data from the ongoing controlled Phase 3 study 1006 will be important to 
further characterise the safety of lorlatinib post authorisation (see Annex II).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 140/148 
 
 
 
 
The  CNS  effects  include  e.g.  mood  effects,  speech  effects,  and  cognitive  effects  and  looking  at  each 
effect  individually  may  cause  an  underestimation  of  the  overall  risk  of  CNS  effects  with  lorlatinib. 
Despite  the  relatively  low  rate  of  Grade  3  events,  the  reported  cognitive  disorders  (neurological  and 
psychiatric) may impact the patient’s quality of life. CNS effects and their origin are very complex and 
challenging  both  to  diagnose  and  evaluate,  and  the  impact  on  patient  functioning  may  be  equally 
difficult to estimate. Therefore, safety results from the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 study comparing 
lorlatinib  to  crizotinib  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC  (see  Annex  II)  are  especially 
important  regarding  the  assessment  of  CNS  effects  in  the  first-line  setting  as  fewer  patients  would 
have metastases to the CNS at that point in time.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There  is  a  recognised  unmet  medical  need  in  ALK-positive  NSCLC  patients  who  progressed  after 
currently available ALK-targeted agents (crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib).  
Treatment  with  lorlatinib  results  in  clinically  relevant  response  rates  and  duration  of  response  in  the 
proposed  second-  and  third  or  later  line  indication.  The  efficacy  in  brain  metastases  is  clinically 
meaningful  and  lorlatinib  is  considered  an  effective  treatment  option  for  patients  with  brain 
metastases. 
A major therapeutic advantage of lorlatinib over treatment alternatives (platinum-based chemotherapy 
and immunotherapies, etc.) can therefore be agreed upon for the proposed indication. 
Although  the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  cohort  EXP-3B  supporting  the  2nd  line  indication  is 
limited, the totality of the data in the post 2nd generation ALK-inhibitors setting can support a positive 
B/R in that indication. The pivotal study is a single arm study with no comparator. However, as ALK is 
a  driver  mutation  in  ALK-positive  NSCLC  and  lorlatinib  is  a  targeted  treatment  against  a  well-known 
target,  a  randomisation  to  chemotherapy,  immunotherapy  or  placebo  is  not  considered  ethical  in  a 
situation,  when  the  disease  progresses  after  use  of  the  available  ALK-inhibitors,  due  to  the  poor 
efficacy  of  these  treatment  options.  Furthermore,  all  of  the  developed  ALK-inhibitors  have  been 
superior  in  efficacy  compared  to  chemotherapy  and  immunotherapy  so  far,  both  regarding  ORR  and 
duration  of  response  and  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  in  patients  who  progressed  after  second 
generation ALKi in the 2nd or 3rd line setting. However, given the limited sample size the applicant will 
conduct and submit an efficacy study post authorisation to further confirm the positive B/R in the 2nd 
line post 2nd generation ALK-inhibitor setting (see Section 3.7.3). The applicant’s proposal for the study 
design  is  considered  acceptable  and  results  from  approximately  70  patients  treated  in  the  proposed 
second-line setting will be available in Q2 2024. 
Efficacy  data  presented  according  to  the  initial  lines  of  ALK-targeted  therapy  from  the  EXP-4  and  5 
cohorts show that almost all of the patients had crizotinib as first-line therapy and that lorlatinib as 3rd 
line treatment only induced responses in patients, who have had previous treatment with crizotinib and 
this is reflected in the wording of the indication. Time to tumour response of 1.4 months is in line with 
other  ALK-inhibitors  and  is  also  considered  clinically  meaningful.  It  is  also  noted  that  the  median  OS 
was  20.5  months  in  the  EXP4-5  cohort,  which  is  considered  highly  clinically  relevant  in  the  third-or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 142/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
later  line  setting.  There  was  no  obvious  selection  bias  of  subsequent  therapies,  the  results  are 
therefore considered clinically relevant and meaningful. 
Reported adverse reactions appear manageable and for the most part reversible and unlikely to affect 
the  tolerability  of  lorlatinib  in  the  proposed  dose.  Lorlatinib  causes  multiple  CNS  effects  which  may 
have a negative impact on the patient’s quality of life. However, it should be noted that only 7.1%  of 
patients discontinued lorlatinib at the proposed dose regimen. 
Finally,  as  part  of  the  requirements  for  granting  CMA,  the  applicant  will  provide  results  from  an 
ongoing  confirmatory  Phase  3  trial  in  Q4  2021  at  the  earliest.  Such  data  will  confirm  the  overall 
efficacy and further characterise the safety profile of lorlatinib in the authorised indication. In addition, 
the  applicant  will  conduct  a  PAES  in  the  2nd  line  post  2nd  generation  ALK  inhibitors  to  confirm  the 
efficacy of lorlatinib in that setting. The results will be submitted by Q2 2024 (see Annex II).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R is positive in the claimed indication. It is agreed that lorlatinib represents a major therapeutic 
advantage  in  patients  who  have  been  previously  treated  with  the  2nd  generation  ALK-inhibitors 
alectinib  or  ceritinib  and/or  crizotinib  who  currently  have  very  limited  treatment  options  with  limited 
efficacy  and  no  standard  of  care.  The  ORR  and  DOR  are  considered  clinically  relevant  in  this  setting 
and  outweigh  the  risks  related  to  the  use  of  lorlatinib.  Lorlatinib  is  a  valuable  treatment  option  with 
clinically meaningful efficacy in the CNS and results show similar response rates both systemically and 
in the CNS. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As  comprehensive  data  on  the  product  are  not  available,  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The  product  falls  within  the  scope  of  Article  14-a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  concerning 
conditional  marketing  authorisations,  as  it  aims  at  the  treatment  of  advanced  ALK-positive  NSCLC 
which is a life-threatening disease.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
 
 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. Treatment with lorlatinib has demonstrated a 
positive  benefit-risk  balance  for  the  treatment  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC  in  the  proposed 
indication. 
It is likely that the applicant will be  able to provide comprehensive data.  The  data package is 
not  considered  comprehensive  and  the  applicant  will  submit  a  Phase  3  confirmatory  study  in 
the  1st  line  setting  to  further  characterise  the  overall  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  lorlatinib. 
Although  the  Phase 3  study  will  be  conducted  in  the  1L  setting  it  will  provide  additional 
evidence to support the overall efficacy of lorlatinib in ALK-positive NSCLC and will allow putting 
safety data into context.  In addition, in  view of  the  limited sample size of cohort EXP-3B, the 
applicant will conduct and submit the  results from  an efficacy  study  to confirm efficacy in the 
proposed 2L ALK-positive NSCLC post 2nd generation ALKi setting. These are specific obligations 
to the CMA. The SOB is considered feasible as there is a high unmet medical need and to date 
no  standard  of  care  is  available  in  the  proposed  second-line  setting  i.e.  after  alectinib  and 
ceritinib and results are awaited by Q2 2024. The confirmatory Phase 3 trial is also considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182840/2019  
Page 143/148 
 
 
 
 
feasible as it is almost fully recruited and results are awaited in Q4 2021. 
 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as to date there is no standard of care in the proposed 
second-  or  later  line  setting.  Patients  who  have  progressed  after  a  second  generation  ALKi  in 
the  2L  or  3L  setting  patients  have  a  poor  long-term  prognosis.  Lorlatinib  represents  a  major 
therapeutic advantage over potential alternative treatment options for the proposed indication 
i.e. chemotherapy and immunotherapy. No targeted therapies (ALK-TKIs) have been approved 
for the applied indication. 
 
The  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the  risks  inherent  in  the 
fact  that  additional  data  are  still  required,  as  the  available  data  show  that  lorlatinib  is  an 
effective  CNS-penetrative  therapy  option  in  patients  who  progressed  after  treatment  with  a 
second  generation  ALK-inhibitors  such  as  alectinib  and  ceritinib,  a  clinical  setting  where 
currently no treatments are authorised.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  lorlatinib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  ALK  positive  advanced  NSCLC 
whose disease has progressed after: alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK TKI therapy; or crizotinib and 
at least one other ALK-TKI is positive. 
A divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Lorviqua is favourable in the following indication:

kinase  (ALK)-positive  advanced  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  whose  disease  has  progressed 
after: 
 
 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 February 2019 
Lorviqua EMEA/H/C/004646/0000 
The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion 
recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation of Lorviqua indicated as monotherapy for 
the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed after: 
• 
• 
alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; or 
crizotinib and at least one other ALK TKI. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Divergent position 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation of Lorviqua 25 & 100 mg film-coated tablets 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment with at least one second-generation ALK tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI).  
In line with the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation, the applicant must ensure that 
a major therapeutic advantage has been shown for the product applied for. In the view of the 
divergent CHMP members, these requirements have not been fulfilled for the following reasons:  
  Major therapeutic advantage has not been shown for the entire claimed indication, as efficacy 
in the second-line setting (i.e. after a previous treatment with a second-generation ALK 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is currently not sufficiently established. The number of patients in the 
second line (n=28) does not allow for a proper evaluation of the efficacy data. 
 
The major therapeutic advantage shown in terms of efficacy in third or further lines cannot be 
extrapolated to the second-line setting, as the Applicant has not provided (non)-clinical data in 
support for such extrapolation approach. 
Thus, the efficacy of Lorviqua 25 & 100 mg film-coated tablets in the claimed indication has not been 
sufficiently demonstrated rendering the B/R relationship of this product undetermined.

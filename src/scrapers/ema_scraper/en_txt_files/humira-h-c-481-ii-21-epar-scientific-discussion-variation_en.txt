Introduction 
Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  containing  human 
peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  and  neutralizes  the  biological 
function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
When  this  application  was  submitted,  Humira  (adalimumab)  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  moderately  to  severely  active  RA  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to  other  disease 
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Rheumatoid  arthritis  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  autoimmune  disease  characterised  by  progressive 
inflammatory synovitis manifested by polyarticular joint swelling and tenderness. The synovitis results in 
erosion of articular cartilage and marginal bone with subsequent joint destruction until enough damage 
occurs to interfere with function of the joint.  
Studies  have demonstrated the potential benefit of early treatment with anti-TNF inhibitors alone or in 
combination with methotrexate (MTX) for recently diagnosed RA subjects. 
The  MAH  submitted  one  pivotal  study,  Study  DE013  (PREMIER),  to  demonstrate  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of adalimumab  +  MTX combination therapy in the treatment of  moderately to severely active 
RA in adult subjects who were recently diagnosed (< 3 years) and who had not been previously treated 
with MTX.   
Based on this study, the MAH proposed an extension of the indication for Humira to include treatment of 
recently diagnosed patients with moderately to severely active RA who have not been previously treated 
with MTX.  
The  MAH  proposed  to  amend  the  text  of  the  SPC,  sections  4.1,  4.8  and  5.1  with  the  results  from  the 
DE013 study, and to update the PL accordingly.

Clinical aspects 
To  support  the  new  indication  “treatment  of  early  RA”,  the  MAH  submitted  a  single  pivotal  phase 
3 study, DE013 (PREMIER).  
2.1 Clinical efficacy 
Study DE013 
The  PREMIER  study  was  a  prospective  multi-centre  randomised,  double-blind,  active  comparator-
controlled,  parallel-groups  study  comparing  adalimumab  given  every  second  week  with  methotrexate 
(MTX)  given  weekly  and  the  combination  of  adalimumab  and  MTX  administered  over  2  years  in 
patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. 
Methods 
Study Population 
Adults ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of active RA as defined by the 1987-revised ACR (American College 
of  Rheumatology)  criteria  (≥ 8  swollen  joints  out  of  66  joints  assessed  and  ≥ 10  tender  joints  out  of 
68 joints assessed) with disease duration < 3 years. Subjects were not to have received previous treatment 
with MTX, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, azathioprine, or more than two other DMARDs.  
The study population of Study DE013 had an average duration of RA since diagnosis of 0.8 years. The 
study  population  was  MTX-naïve  and  most  (67.5%)  had  not  previously  received  any  DMARD  for  the 
treatment of their RA. Eighty-three percent (83%) of the subjects were rheumatoid factor (RF) positive.

The mean tender joint count was 31.6 and the mean swollen joint count was 21.6. The overall activity 
score, as measured by the DAS28, was 6.3, indicating high disease activity.  
The mean age was 52 years and 74.5% of subjects were female.  
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: 
adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) sc (adalimumab + placebo weekly); 
adalimumab 40 mg eow together with weekly MTX; or  
- 
- 
-  weekly MTX (MTX + placebo eow). 
Adalimumab + Placebo Escalation/De-escalation:  
The dosing interval of the blinded parenteral study medication was to be decreased from eow to weekly 
in subjects who failed to respond, or who lost their response, on or after 16 weeks of treatment. Failure to 
respond was defined as not reaching an ACR20 response compared to baseline on two consecutive visits 
at  least  two  weeks  apart.  The  individual  dose  of  the  blinded  oral  study  medication  was  to  have  been 
optimised (i.e the highest tolerated dose was to be administered for at least 6 weeks) 
MTX + Placebo Escalation/De-escalation:  
Oral  MTX  was  started  at  7.5  mg/week  and  was  to  have  remained  at  this  dose  for  four  weeks.  In  the 
presence of any remaining swollen joints, the dose was increased to 15 mg from Week 5 forward for an 
additional 4 weeks and to a total of 20 mg from Week 9 forward (completed by Week 26). 
In cases of more typical MTX toxicities, the dose of MTX was reduced to ≥7.5 mg/week. If MTX was 
required  to  be  reduced  below  7.5  mg/week,  subjects  should  be  withdrawn  from  the  study.  MTX 
reduction  was  predefined  in  relation  to  ALT  increases.  Study  medication  was  also  to  be  withdrawn  if 
AST or ALT remained elevated (≥2 X ULNl) despite MTX dose reduction. This was also applicable if 
AST or ALT remained elevated 1.5-2 X ULN for more than 12 weeks. 
Outcomes/Endpoints 
The primary objective was to examine the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in combination with MTX 
vs. MTX monotherapy in the treatment of early RA. If this primary objective was met, a second primary 
analysis  was  to  be  performed  to  investigate  whether  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy  was 
superior to MTX monotherapy in the inhibition of radiographic progression as measured by change from 
Baseline in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) at Week 52. 
Additional objectives included an assessment of the role of the study treatments in the therapy of subjects 
with early RA using other secondary efficacy parameters.  
Efficacy Variables 
Primary Efficacy Variables 
The two primary efficacy endpoints were: 
1.  Proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  an  ACR50  response  at  Week  52  between  adalimumab  +  MTX 
combination therapy and MTX monotherapy; and 
2. Change from Baseline in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) between adalimumab + MTX combination 
therapy and MTX monotherapy at Week 52. 
If primary endpoint number 1 was  met, the second primary endpoint  was to be analysed to investigate 
whether adalimumab + MTX combination therapy is superior to MTX monotherapy in the inhibition of 
radiographic progression.

ACR50 Responder Criteria 
Subjects were considered to have an ACR50 'responder' status if the following three criteria were met: 
≥50% improvement from Baseline in TJC and in SJC and in three of the following five parameters: 
a. Patient's Assessment of Pain (VAS). 
b. Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS). 
c. Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS). 
d. Subject's self-assessment of physical function (Disability Index of the HAQ). 
e. Acute phase reactant value (CRP). 
The secondary Efficacy Variables included assessment of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70; HAQ; SF-36, 
DAS28, TSS, ACR-N at various time points throughout the study.  
Regarding the modified Total Sharp Score at week 52, the CHMP requested additional justification on 
why analysis of inter- and intra-reader reliability was not conducted, and on the chosen cut-off value for 
the modified Total Sharp score and its clinical relevance. 
The  MAH  provided  additional  information  explaining  the  inter-reader  agreement.  Additionally, 
justification  was  provided  on  the  fact  that  no  specific  cut-off  value  for  minimal  clinically  important 
change  in  TSS  was  predefined.  Evolution  of  mean  change  in  TSS  from  baseline  provided  acceptable 
support of superiority of adalimumab vs. MTX. As for ACR, all data support that adalimumab should, 
preferentially, be used with MTX.  
The  MAH  was  further  asked  to  explain  the  reasons  why  TSS  was  missing  for  66  patients  in  the 
adalimumab+MTX  group,  and  85  in  the  MTX  arm.  The  MAH  informed  that  the  primary  reason  for 
different percentages of missing x-rays was the different discontinuation rates for the two groups. At the 
end  of  104  weeks  there  were  65  subjects  who  prematurely  terminated  in  the  adalimumab  +  MTX 
combination  therapy  group  and  88  from  the  MTX  monotherapy  group.  Comparable  percentages 
terminated from  each group due to adverse events (AEs) (11.9% and 7.4% in the adalimumab + MTX 
and  MTX  groups,  respectively)  as  well  as  other  reasons  for  early  termination.  However,  the  one 
exception was termination due to lack of efficacy, which was less common in the adalimumab + MTX 
combination therapy group (4.9%) than the MTX monotherapy group (17.9%). While this difference was 
pronounced at Week 52 when the primary analysis was performed, the overall early discontinuation rates 
and missing x-rays were comparable between the groups at Week 52. Hence the MAH considered that 
the evaluation of the co-primary endpoint was still valid. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  level  of  missing  data  was  higher  than  optimal.  However,  it  appeared 
reasonable that the much more frequent loss of X-rays from the MTX arm due to discontinuation for lack 
of efficacy argues against bias in favour of adalimumab. It was considered unlikely that any sensitivity 
analysis would change conclusions reached previously. 
Results 
Patients disposition 
A  total  of  799  subjects  received  at  least  one  injection  of  study  medicinal  product  and  were  analysed. 
Overall, a total of 539 subjects completed 2 years: 169 (65.8%) who received MTX monotherapy, 167 
(60.9%)  who  received  adalimumab  monotherapy,  and  203  (75.7%)  who  received  adalimumab  +  MTX 
combination therapy.  
Overall,  a  total  of  260  subjects  prematurely  terminated  the  study:  88  (34.2%)  who  received  MTX 
monotherapy,  107  (39.1%)  who  received  adalimumab  monotherapy,  and  65  (24.3%)  who  received 
adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy.  Subject  disposition  at  Week  52  was  comparable  to  that 
observed at Week 104.

Overall  the  disease  activity  seems  to  reflect  a  population  of  moderate  to  severe  active  disease. 
Disposition of patients including terminated patients reflect the intended use of the combination therapy 
up to 2 year.  
Efficacy results 
Adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy  was  compared  to  MTX  monotherapy  and  adalimumab 
monotherapy using two co-primary endpoints: the proportion of subjects who achieved ACR50 response 
at  52  weeks  and  the  change  from  Baseline  in  modified  Total  Sharp  Score  (TSS)  after  52  weeks.  The 
chosen  primary  endpoints  and  respective  timepoints  are  consistent  with  regulatory  guidance.  Study 
DE013  was  in  compliance  with  GCP  and  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki,  and  utilised  current  standard 
research approaches regarding design, conduct, and analysis.  
The results of primary and secondary endpoints are presented in the Tables below.

therapeutic  effect  compared  to  52  (19.0%)  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  monotherapy  group  and  46 
(17.9%) subjects in the MTX monotherapy group. 
The  CHMP  requested  supplementary  information.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  submit  the  results  for  the 
clinical  endpoints  ACR20  response  at  6  months  and  AUC  ACR-N  from  0-6  months.  The  MAH 
submitted  the  requested  data  and  results  from  AUC  ACR  N  at  6  months  were  shown  statistically 
significantly  in  favour  of  the  combination  group  compared  with  monotherapy.  ACR20  was  not 
significantly different at 6 months but ACR 50 was accepted as a more stringent level of efficacy.  
The  CHMP  requested  supplementary  information  on  how  many  patients  required  dose  escalation  and 
how  this  affected  efficacy  (or  safety)  and  a  further  justification  on  the  dosing  regimen  proposed.  The 
MAH informed that the proportion of patients who dose escalated and had a response at Weeks 52 and 
104  was  similar  for  all  three  treatment  groups.  In  addition,  the  number  (%)  of  subjects  achieving  a 
response  after  dose  escalation  at  these  timepoints  was  small  for  ACR20,  ACR50,  and  DAS28  <  2.6. 
Thus, patients for whom the dose was escalated had only a small contribution to the outcome of efficacy 
endpoints at Weeks 52 and 104. The MAH provided data that show that 40 mg eow is the appropriate 
dose for this patient population, and that dose escalation may be beneficial for a very small proportion of 
patients only. Thus, there is no reason  to recommend a  dose escalation  of adalimumab, as  only a very 
small  proportion  of  patients  would  benefit  from  this.  Consequently,  the  recommended  dose  of 
adalimumab is 40 mg e.o.w.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  at  week  52  and  104  is  in  favour  of  the  combination  of  adalimumab  and  MTX  v.s.  both  the 
monotherapy  options  as  measured  by  the  primary  endpoints  ACR50  and  x-ray  score.  The  CHMP  also 
noted  that  secondary  efficacy  variables  indicate  similar  efficacy  with  the  two  monotherapies  and  the 
combination is statistically significantly superior to both, as measured with ACR20/50/70, ACR-N and as 
major clinical response.  
However,  the  CHMP  noted  that  adalimumab  monotherapy  seems  to  have  greater  efficacy  than  MTX 
monotherapy  on  X-ray  outcomes  but  not  on  signs  and  symptoms.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  further 
explain this.  After the submission  of supplementary information from the MAH, it was  concluded that 
adalimumab  in  combination  with  MTX  is  more  effective  than  adalimumab  monotherapy,  and  that  this 
option  is  the  one  to  be  recommended  primarily  in  the  SPC.  However,  for  patients  who  do  not  tolerate 
MTX, adalimumab monotherapy might be an alternative, which is also reflected in the SPC.  
A comparison of all efficacy endpoints following one and two years of treatment for the combination of 
adalimumab  +  MTX  therapy  demonstrates  the  persistence  of  response  throughout  the  study,  e.g  as 
evident by the ACR 70 response which was maintained for six continuous months. Following 104 weeks 
of  treatment,  48.5%  (130/268)  of  subjects  who  received  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy 
achieved  a  major  clinical  response,  thereby  demonstrating  the  persistence  of  response  over  two  years.  
The  results  of  efficacy  analyses  do  not  indicate  any  loss  of  efficacy  over  time  for  the  adalimumab 
treatment groups.

2.2 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  extent  of  exposure  is  presented  in  the  Table  4  below.  With  regard  specifically  to  adalimumab 
exposure,  all  subjects  randomized  to  either  the  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy  group  or  the 
adalimumab  monotherapy  group  received  adalimumab  for  at  least  four  weeks.  Longer  durations  of 
exposure  to  adalimumab  were  seen  in  those  subjects  treated  with  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination 
therapy (e.g., 221 of 268 subjects [82.5%] received adalimumab for greater than 52 weeks) than in those 
subjects treated with adalimumab monotherapy (e.g., 195 of 274 subjects [71.2%] received adalimumab 
for greater than 52 weeks).

All  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis 
(MTX monotherapy = 257, adalimumab monotherapy = 274, adalimumab + MTX combination therapy = 
268). 
The overall incidences of treatment-emergent Adverse events reported across the three treatment groups 
were  comparable:  MTX  monotherapy  (95.3%),  adalimumab  monotherapy  (95.6%)  and  adalimumab  + 
MTX combination therapy (97.8%). 
There were 11.3% (29 of 257) of subjects in the MTX monotherapy group, 13.9% (38 of 274) of subjects 
in  the  adalimumab  monotherapy  group,  and  12.7%  (34  of  268)  of  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  +  MTX 
therapy treatment group who discontinued study medicinal product due to an AE. 
The overall percentage of infectious Adverse events was higher in the adalimumab + MTX combination 
group (77.2%) than in the MTX (68.1%) or adalimumab (67.5%) monotherapy groups. This difference 
was statistically  significant (p = 0.020)  and the pair  wise comparisons between each  monotherapy arm 
and  the  combination  therapy  arm  were  also  statistically  significant.  The  overall  percentage  of  serious 
infectious Adverse events was 4.9% in the adalimumab + MTX, 2.7% in the MTX group, and 1.1% in

The  most  frequent  (>5%  of  subjects  in  any  treatment  group)  treatment-emergent  infectious  Adverse 
events  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  pharyngitis,  sinusitis,  herpes  simplex, 
urinary tract infection, bronchitis, and influenza. 
Serious adverse events, malignancies and deaths  
a) Serious adverse events 
The  most  common  serious  infectious  Adverse  events  reported  by  subjects  among  the  three  treatment 
groups were pneumonia, septic arthritis, and cellulitis.  
There was one case of tuberculosis reported in the adalimumab + MTX combination therapy arm. 
There were no demyelinating events reported.  
One case of a lupus-like reaction was reported in Study DE013 by a subject who received adalimumab 
monotherapy.  
Two subjects had serious adverse events coded as heart failure, one in each of the monotherapy arms.  
b) Malignancies

No  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  malignancies, 
overall  (p  =  0.807)  or  excluding  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  (p  =  0.727),  across  treatment  groups 
Treatment-emergent  malignancies,  including  skin  cancers,  were  reported  by  15  subjects  (5  of  257 
subjects  [2.0%]  in  the  MTX  monotherapy  group,  4  of  274  subjects  [1.5%]  in  the  adalimumab 
monotherapy  group,  and  6  of  268  subjects  [2.2%]  in  the  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy 
group).  Treatment-emergent  malignancies  excluding  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  were  reported  by  10 
subjects  (4  of  257  subjects  [1.6%]  in  the  MTX  monotherapy  group,  4  of  274  subjects  [1.5%]  in  the 
adalimumab monotherapy group, and 2 of 268 subjects [0.8%] in the adalimumab + MTX combination 
therapy group). One lymphoma was observed (in the MTX monotherapy arm). 
c) Deaths 
A total of six deaths (0.7% of 799 subjects) were reported over the two-year double-blind period of the 
study.  Four  of  these  deaths  occurred  in  the  adalimumab  arm  and  one  each  occurred  in  the  MTX  and 
combination arms.

Laboratory findings 
Statistically significant  differences  between the  mean  changes in  the  adalimumab + MTX combination 
therapy  group  and  the  MTX  monotherapy  group  were  observed  for  5  of  the  19  clinical  chemistry 
parameters (alkaline phosphatase, AST, bilirubin, CK, and cholesterol). 
Of these five parameters, three were liver function tests. Relative to the MTX monotherapy group, the 
adalimumab + MTX combination therapy group showed a greater mean decrease in alkaline phosphatase 
(-21.8  IU/l  vs.  –11.8  IU/  l).  The  adalimumab  +  MTX  combination  therapy  group  had  greater  mean 
increases in AST (2.5 IU/ l vs. 1.5 IU/ l) and total bilirubin (2.2 µmol/ l vs. 1.4 µmol/ l).  
The other two chemistries that were significantly different between the adalimumab + MTX combination 
therapy group and the MTX monotherapy group were cholesterol (0.5 mmol/ l vs. 0.2 mmol/ l) and CK 
(10.9 IU/ l vs. 4.9 IU/ l). 
Discussion of clinical safety 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  adverse  event  profile  was  similar  to  the  one  previously  seen  in  the 
currently approved indication. However, a tendency towards more infections in the combination therapy 
group was found, which was not considered surprising. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  antibody  data  were  lacking  and  should  be  submitted.  In  particular  long-term 
effects with monotherapy should be discussed and described in relation to antibody findings. In a request 
for supplementary information the MAH provided data from the initial submission for RA that show that 
the  presence  of  antibodies  to  adalimumab  is  higher  in  monotherapy,  12%,  versus  1%  in  combination 
therapy.  Antibody  status  among  non-responders  and  those  with  relapse  was  evaluated.  Both  antibody 
positive and negative patients were found in these groups, with a majority of the negative, and thus no 
clear  correlation  to  non-response  was  found.  Since  data  from  responders  on  monotherapy  was  not 
presented,  the  antibody  profile  in  this  population  is  unknown.  Interruption  of  dose  was  not  possible  to 
evaluate as the number of patients was too low.  
Furthermore, the CHMP noted the tendency towards increased levels in the Liver Function Tests, in the 
adalimumab+MTX  combination  group.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  submit  further  documentation  to 
demonstrate any possibly treatment-related changes throughout the duration of the trial and comment as 
to the possible mechanism of these changes. Additionally, the MAH was asked to discuss the need for 
monitoring  of  liver  enzymes  during  treatment  with  adalimumab.  The  MAH  submitted  supplementary 
information and detailed that the data presented on liver function tests and hepatic events do not indicate 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any  new  alarming  findings.  Monitoring  of  hepatic  enzymes  is  mandatory  during  treatment  with  MTX. 
However,  specific  monitoring  of  hepatic  events  due  to  treatment  with  adalimumab  is  not  considered 
necessary. The CHMP agreed with the justification.  
3. 
Overall Discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
The overall risk/benefit of treatment in patients with RA with a disease duration up to 3 years without 
previous  methotrexate  therapy,  is  in  favour  of  methotrexate  and  adalimumab  given  in  combination. 
Adalimumab in monotherapy is similar to MTX in monotherapy. Existing clinical data demonstrate that 
combination of antiTNF therapy and MTX is superior to MTX or antiTNF monotherapy for both clinical 
and radiological outcomes. This is supported by the data submitted for adalimumab.  
Taking  into  account  ACR,  clinical  remission  and  TSS  data,  it  appears  reasonable  to  conclude  that 
adalimumab monotherapy could be an alternative to MTX. However, adalimumab should preferentially 
be  used  with  MTX.  Therefore,  the  indication  should  recommend  the  combination  of  MTX  and 
adalimumab. However, as for the already approved RA indication, a possibility to treat patients who are 
intolerant  to  MTX  should  be  possible.  The  proposed  indication  is:  “Humira  in  combination  with 
methotrexate,  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  severe,  active  and  progressive  rheumatoid  arthritis  in 
adults  not  previously  treated  with  methotrexate.  Humira  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of 
intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.” 
A full description of the PREMIER data, including all three-treatment arms, is of value for the prescriber, 
to  allow  for  a  benefit/risk  assessment  for  the  treatment  of  the  individual  patient.  Thus,  the  CHMP 
requested  that  the  results  from  combination  therapy  as  well  as  the  two-monotherapy  groups  should  be 
described in section 5.1 of the SPC.  
No unknown safety signals have been found in the submitted study; although elevated hepatic enzymes 
were more common in the MTX + adalimumab monotherapy compared with both monotherapy arms. 
The CHMP recommended that follow-up programmes be continued.  
CONCLUSION 
The CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the proposed wordings to be 
introduced into the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP adopted on 23 June 2005 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

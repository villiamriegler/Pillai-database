BESPONSA (INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN) RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
RMP Version number: 2.2
Data lock point for this RMP:15 February 2023
Date of final sign off: 13 December 2023
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
Following the receipt of a comment regarding the RMP in the context of the Besponsa-II-26 
procedure from the EMA, on 13 December 2023, the MAH is complying with the request to 
remove the interventional PAES B19310341.  This PAES was included in the RMP versions
2.0 and 2.1 as efficacy study that is Specific Obligation in the context of a conditional 
marketing authorisation.  
The RMP version 2.0 included the newly emerged paediatric data from the study ITCC-059
(WI203581) “A phase I/II study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin as a single agent and in 
combination with chemotherapy for pediatric CD22-positive relapsed/refractory Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Study ITCC-059”.

safety, and pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL from 
mainland China. This efficacy study is under a Specific Obligation in the context of a conditional marketing 
authorisation in China; the FSFV occurred on 24 February 2023.  As per EMA request, this PAES will be 
included in a letter of Recommendation.

Brief description of the product:
Hyperlink to the Product 
Information:
Indication(s) in the EEA
Chemical class: inotuzumab ozogamicin is an ADC composed 
of a CD22 -directed monoclonal antibody that is covalently 
linked to N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide.  
Inotuzumab is a humanised IgG4 antibody which specifically 
recognises human CD22.  The small molecule, N-acetyl-
gamma-calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic product.  
N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin is covalently attached to the 
antibody via an acid-cleavable linker.
Summary of mode of action: nonclinical data suggest that the 
anticancer activity of inotuzumab ozogamicin is due to the 
binding of the ADC to CD22-expressing tumour cells, followed 
by internalisation of the ADC-CD22 complex, and the 
intracellular release of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin 
dimethylhydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. 
Activation of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide 
induces double-stranded DNA breaks, subsequently inducing 
cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.
Important information about its composition: inotuzumab 
ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody that is manufactured using 
a recombinant CHO cell line that contains the DNA encoding 
the sequence for inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Excipients include sucrose, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, and 
tromethamine.
Please refer to Module 1.3.1 of this submission.
Current:
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-
cell precursor ALL.  Adult patients with Ph+ relapsed or 
refractory B-cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment 
with at least 1 TKI.
Page 14
Dosage in the EEA
Current:
Inotuzumab ozogamicin should be administered in 3-to 4-week
cycles.  
For patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of 
treatment is 2 cycles. A third cycle may be considered for those 
patients who do not achieve a CR or complete remission with 
CRi and MRD negativity after 2 cycles. For patients not 
proceeding to HSCT, additional cycles of treatment, up to a 
maximum of 6 cycles, may be administered. Patients who do not 
achieve a CR/CRi within 3 cycles should discontinue treatment.
For the first cycle, the recommended total dose of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin for all patients is 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle, given as 3 
divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 
mg/m2). Cycle 1 is 3 weeks in duration, but may be extended to 
4 weeks if the patient achieves a CR or CRi, and/or to allow 
recovery from toxicity.
For subsequent cycles, the recommended total dose of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin is 1.5 mg/m2 per cycle given as 3 
divided doses on Days 1 (0.5 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 
mg/m2) for patients who achieve a CR/CRi or 1.8 mg/m2 per 
cycle given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 
mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who do not achieve a 
CR/CRi. Subsequent cycles are 4 weeks in duration.
Dose modification of inotuzumab ozogamicin may be required 
based on individual safety and tolerability. Management of some 
adverse drug reactions may require dosing interruptions and/or 
dose reductions, or permanent discontinuation of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin. If the dose is reduced due to inotuzumab 
ozogamicin related toxicity, the dose should not be re-escalated.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin doses within a treatment cycle (i.e., 
Days 8 and/or 15) do not need to be interrupted due to 
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, but dosing interruptions 
within a cycle are recommended for non-haematological 
toxicities. 
No adjustment to the starting dose is required based on age.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with 
hepatic impairment defined by total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and 
AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN. There is limited safety information 
available in patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN and 
AST/ALT > 2.5 x ULN prior to dosing. Interrupt dosing until 
recovery of total bilirubin to ≤ 1.5 x ULN and AST/ALT to ≤
2.5 x ULN prior to each dose unless due to Gilbert’s syndrome 
or haemolysis. Permanently discontinue treatment if total 
bilirubin does not recover to ≤ 1.5 x ULN or AST/ALT does not 
recover to ≤ 2.5 x ULN.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 
mL/min, 30-59 mL/min, or 15-29 mL/min, respectively). The 
safety and efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin have not been 
studied in patients with end stage renal disease.
Page 15
The safety and efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in children 
(aged 0 to <18 years) have not been established. No data are 
available.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is for intravenous use. The infusion 
must be administered over 1 hour.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin should not be administered as an 
intravenous push or bolus. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin must be reconstituted and diluted 
before administration.
Pharmaceutical form(s) and strengths Current:
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for 
concentrate).
White to off white, lyophilised cake or powder.
Each vial contains 1 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin. After 
reconstitution, 1 mL of solution contains 0.25 mg inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.
The required volume of the reconstituted solution needed to 
obtain the appropriate dose according to patient body surface 
area is added to an infusion container with sodium chloride 9

Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population (s)
Indication:
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is proposed to be indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor ALL. Adult patients with 
Ph+ relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 
TKI.
Literature search strategy
The PubMed database was searched for primary literature and review articles reporting 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality estimates of relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL in the 
general population through July 2015 and updated in January 2023.  When applicable, 
bibliographies cited by each identified paper were reviewed to identify additional relevant 
literature.  Searches were confined to articles involving humans.  Estimates primarily from 
the EU and US populations were included. The original search also included articles focused 
on important comorbidities of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL.
Epidemiologic estimates and important comorbidities are summarised for the target 
indication, relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, when available. However, because literature 
regarding the epidemiology of the target indication of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL is very limited, estimates of ALL epidemiology were also provided. 
Therefore, the type of ALL (e.g., B-cell) will be specified when known.
Incidence: 
No population studies were identified that reported the incidence rate of relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL. However, the following estimates for ALL, irrespective of subtype, 
were available.
Europe
A previous study examined leukaemia subtype data available from 290 cancer registries 
across 68 countries worldwide using the IARC Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume 
X database.1 The study estimated 20,684 incident ALL cases in Europe between 2003 and 
2007 (Miranda-Filho, 2018). Age-standardised incidence rates across Europe ranged from 
0.6 per 100,000 in both males and females in Serbia to 2.4 per 100,000 in females in Cyprus 
(Table 1). For 15 of the 29 countries included from Europe, the rate was 1.5 per 100,000 or 
greater for both males and females. This study also found geographical disparities in non-
European countries, specifically Central and South America, with the highest incidences in 
Ecuador (males: 2.8 per 100,000; females: 3.3 per 100,000), Costa Rica (males: 2.4 per 
100,000; females: 2.3 per 100,000), and Colombia (males: 2.3 per 100,000; females: 2.1 per 
100,000).
Another study using the IARC Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume X database 
reported incidence rates for childhood and adult ALL in selected countries.2 The study found 
Page 17
that age-standardised incidence rates for ALL in the UK, Denmark, Spain, Germany, and 
Italy during 2003–2007 were >3.0 per 100,000 among children aged 0-19 years but <1.0 per 
100,000 among adults aged 20+ years, representing more than a threefold difference.

In 2016-2018, there were 791 new cases of ALL in the UK: 464 (59%) in males and 327 
(41%) in females, giving a male: female ratio of approximately 1.4: 1.3  The 2016-2018 
European age-standardised incidence rate was 1.1 per 100,000 (males 1.3 per 100,000 and 
females 0.9 per 100,000). 
In 2021, for Sweden, the age standardised incidence of ALL per 100,000 (according to the 
population of the year 2000) was 1.6 in men and 1.2 in women.4
The B-cell subtype accounts for approximately 75% of ALL cases in adults and 
approximately 88% in children.5,6
US
Estimates of ALL incidence in the US come from the US SEER Program of the NCI.7 The 
overall age-adjusted incidence rate in 2015-2019 was 1.8 per 100,000 individuals, with males 
having a slightly higher overall rate than females (2.1 per 100,000 vs. 1.6 per 100,000) 
(Table 2). The median age of diagnosis for ALL is 17 years, with 53.9% of patients 
diagnosed before the age of 20 years.

Overall, in the US, 6,540 new cases of ALL (3,660 males, 2,880 females) were expected in 
2023 along with 1,390 expected deaths (700 males, 690 females).9
Page 19
From 2001 to 2007, the annual incidence rate for B-cell ALL was reported as 1.2 per 100,000 
individuals.10  A higher incidence rate was reported in males compared with females, 1.3 
versus 1.1 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.
Prevalence:
No population studies were identified that reported the prevalence rate of relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL.  Prevalence rates per subpopulation within the ALL category itself 
will vary substantially depending on the age at diagnosis, subtype of ALL, treatment and 
other prognostic factors. 
Europe
In 2022, Orphanet, a consortium of European countries that provides, among other services, a 
public database of drugs with an orphan designation, along with prevalence numbers cited 
from various data sources (www.orpha.net),11 cited ALL as having a prevalence rate (patients 
currently diagnosed and hence under treatment) of 11.0 per 100,000 persons.  With the total 
population of the EU and UK at approximately 514.5 million,12 a rough estimate of the 
number of ALL cases in the EU and UK would be 56,595 individuals as of 01 January 2022.  
The age and gender specific prevalence rates for Europe were not available. 
US
An estimated 107,620 individuals were living with acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the US in 
2019.7 Based on estimates derived from SEER, 21.0% of total ALL cases were children aged 
<15 years and approximately half (53.1%) of total cases were adults aged 20-49 years, with 
similar patterns by gender.13  The breakdown by age and gender is presented in Table 3 (ages 
<15 years was the youngest category available):

Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Age
As described above, the incidence of ALL is highest in childhood with rates peaking among 
children aged 1-4 years. Incidence rates remain low in younger adults before gradually 
increasing after age 50.
In the US, the incidence of ALL is 0.7 per 100,000 for adults in their mid to late-20s to early-
40s.14  The incidence rate then begins to increase very gradually, with the peak adult rate of 
2.0 per 100,000 for persons 80-84 years.
Sex
As described in the Incidence section above, Table 1 and Table 2 show that incidence rates 
for ALL were generally higher in males than females in both Europe and the US.
Race/Ethnic Origin
In the US, the majority of cases occurred among non-Hispanic Whites (44.1%) and Hispanics 
(39.9%), with incidence rates of 1.6 per 100,000 and 2.6 per 100,000, respectively.8 In 2001-
2007, the incidence rate of B-cell ALL in the US was greater among Hispanics (1.8 per 
100,000) than in Whites or Blacks (1.1 per 100,000 or 0.6 per 100,000), respectively.10
Risk Factors for the Disease
In most cases the aetiology of ALL is not known, however, several risk factors for ALL have 
been established.15
Page 21
Radiation Exposure
There is strong evidence that ionizing radiation exposure increases the risk of ALL.  Studies 
show that survivors of the World War II atomic bomb blasts have substantially greater risk of 
acute leukaemia.9,16  The magnitude of the risk varies according to the dose and duration of 
the exposure as well as to the developmental period in which the exposure occurred 
(preconception, in utero, postnatal).16  With respect to diagnostic x-rays and risk of ALL, the 
results are inconsistent across studies.16  Paternal exposure in the preconception period16 and 
foetal exposure during the critical developmental period9, 16 may increase risk to some 
degree, but this is not certain. 
Chemical Exposure
Exposure to pesticides and hydrocarbons, particularly benzene, is linked to risk of ALL.  For 
benzene, ALL risk appears to be imparted primarily through prenatal exposures (i.e., the 
preconception and in utero periods).16  Numerous studies indicate that both direct and 
indirect exposure to pesticides are associated with childhood ALL.17
Race/Ethnicity
As described above, the majority of ALL cases occurred among non-Hispanics Whites and 
Hispanics, with incidence 62.5% greater among Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites; see
above the section Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease.
Gender
The incidence of ALL is slightly greater among males than females; see above the section 
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease.
The main existing treatment options:
Currently available treatment options for the treatment of Ph- ALL and Ph+ ALL are 
summarized below. 
Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Ph- B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
The majority subtype of B-cell ALL among adults is Ph-.  
Acceptable re-induction regimens include therapies based on a backbone of vincristine, 
corticosteroids, anthracyclines, ± asparaginase; Hyper-CVAD; cytarabine-based regimens 
such as HIDAC and fludarabine plus cytarabine plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(FLAG) +/- idarubicin; methotrexate-based regimens; allogeneic HSCT; and other 
chemotherapy regimens.18,19
Agents with EU approval(s) by any route (Mutual Recognition, Centralised, Decentralised, or 
National) relevant to the treatment of relapsed or refractory Ph- B-cell ALL include 
Page 22
xaluprine, clofarabine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, 
daunorubicin, asparaginase, and doxorubicin.  More recently, blinatumomab, a bispecific 
CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager, was approved.  In addition to the medications listed 
above, medications indicated for the palliative management of leukaemias and lymphomas in 
adults include corticosteroids. 
Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Ph+ Positive B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
In the EU, 3 TKIs have been approved for the treatment of Ph+ B-cell ALL: imatinib, 
dasatinib, and ponatinib.  Imatinib was approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
Ph+ ALL; dasatinib was approved for adult patients with Ph+ ALL with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy; and ponatinib was approved for adult patients with ALL for 
whom no other TKI therapy is indicated.
Role of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
For patients with relapsed or refractory ALL eligible for HSCT, the ultimate goal of therapy 
is to achieve a CR prior to proceeding to a potentially curative allogeneic HSCT.
For patients with ALL refractory to primary chemotherapy or with early relapse, or in those 
who have a poor prognosis, allogeneic HSCT is considered the only potentially curative 
option.  According to the LALA-94 study, which examined the outcome of patients with 
ALL 15 to 55 years of age in first relapse, OS at 5 years was only 8% for all relapsed 
patients; however, for patients who had available donors and were able to achieve a second 
CR and survive until they received an allogeneic HSCT (61/421), 5-year OS was 33%.20  
Likewise, outcomes from 609 patients with ALL, aged 15 to 60 years of age in first relapse 
enrolled in the MRC/ ECOG 2993 study showed a 23% 5-year OS for patients receiving a 
HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT (n=42) and a 16% 5-year OS for patients receiving 
matched unrelated donor allogeneic HSCT (n=65), compared with 15% for autologous HSCT 
and 4% for chemotherapy.21
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Morbidity
If left untreated, ALL is usually fatal within a few weeks, depending on the level of bone 
marrow failure, related cytopenias, and effects of circulating blast cells and their metabolites 
on vital organs.22  At diagnosis, severe anaemia (haemoglobin <8 g/dl) is present in 28%, 
severe granulocytopenia (neutrophils <0.5×109 l−1) in 22%, severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelets <25×109 l−1) in 30%, hyperleukocytosis (total white blood cells >50×109/L) in 28%, 
and detectable circulating blast cells in 92% of cases.22  Resulting complications include 
febrile neutropenia, infections, sepsis, bleeding disorder and CNS complications.  Spread of 
leukaemic cells to the CNS is likely in untreated or ineffectively treated patients.  Headache 
and cranial nerve or other nerve palsies are related to meningeal or extradural nerve 
involvement, which occurs in 5–10% of cases at presentation.  The presence of 
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly by physical examination is found in 
Page 23
approximately 50% of patients.  Death occurs soon in untreated cases as a result of 
infections, hemorrhages, or a combination of both.22
Front-line therapy for adults with ALL results in rates of CR ranging between 78% and 93% 
in recent clinical trials.23  Around 10–20% (depending on age) of patients die during 
induction treatment, and a further 10% are truly refractory to remission-induction therapy.  In 
addition to these early failures, more than half of the patients who achieve a CR are expected 
to relapse.  There is an overall chance of cure in approximately 20–40% of adult patients 
after initially being diagnosed with ALL.22
In relapsed or refractory ALL, additional complications may occur as a result of prior 
treatment.  These complications include chemotherapy-induced organ toxicity (e.g., renal, 
hepatic, cardiac, pancreas, CNS) along with haematologic toxicities and consequences of 
serious infections.  If prior ALL therapy included an allogeneic HSCT, the patient may have 
toxicities relating to GVHD and its continuous immunosuppressive therapy.  In adults, 
secondary malignancies may also develop following ALL treatment.6,22
Mortality
Following a first relapse in adult ALL patients, only 30-45% of patients experience a second 
CR after salvage chemotherapy with a median survival of 5-9 months.24  The outcome is 
especially poor for patients with primary refractory disease, short duration of ﬁrst remission 
(<12 months), or relapse after HSCT.  In such patients, CR occurs in 20–30% of patients, 
with median OS of 3–6 months.24  The prognosis for patients who have disease that has 
failed multiple lines of therapy is even worse.  In 609 adults with recurring ALL, all of whom 
were previously treated on the MRC UKALL12/ECOG2993 study, the OS at 5 years after 
relapse was 7% (95% CI=4%-9%).  Prognosis is worse for standard risk patients with 
persistent detectable MRD during consolidation as this has been associated with a higher risk 
of relapse.25  In comparison, the OS at 5 years of newly diagnosed patients was 38% (95% 
CI=36%-41%).21
Important co-morbidities:
Liver and Renal Dysfunction
In a retrospective study of 151 consecutive adult patients with ALL in Germany (median age 
of 31 years), who received allogeneic HSCT between 1995 and 2007, all patients had 
received initial treatment according to the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL 
protocols.  At baseline, 33 (22%) of patients had liver dysfunction (29 mild, 4 moderate or 
severe) and none of the patients had renal dysfunction.26
Diabetes
In a retrospective study of 151 consecutive adult patients with ALL in Germany (median age 
of 31 years), who received HSCT between 1995 and 2007, 4 (3%) patients had diabetes at the 
start of treatment.26  Saillard investigated the application of a comorbidity index to predict 
treatment outcomes in older adults newly diagnosed with ALL in France between 1995 and 
Page 24
2012.  A total of 89 consecutive patients, age 60 years and older, were analysed.  Of these 89 
patients, 9 (10%) had diabetes.27
Toxicities Related to Prior ALL Chemotherapy
Relapsed or refractory ALL patients experience significant toxicity from their prior 
chemotherapy.6  Asparaginase is poorly tolerated in adults and may cause 
thrombotic/bleeding issues, pancreatitis, and/or liver toxicity acutely, or upon administration 
of second line therapy.28  Prior ALL therapy often includes methotrexate and 
6 mercaptopurine; both drugs commonly cause liver toxicity.29  Anthracyclines are 
commonly associated with cardiac toxicity.30  In general, ALL chemotherapies are extremely 
myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive both in the initial induction treatment and in 
conditioning regimens pre-HSCT.  Conditioning regimens for allogenic HSCT cause nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, anorexia, end-organ toxicities such as heart, lung, kidney and 
liver, and are frequently associated with serious bacterial, viral and/or fungal infections.6
Antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral therapy used in the treatment or as prophylaxis for 
infections that result from immunosuppression, are often themselves associated with 
toxicities either acutely (e.g., amphotericin B associated with renal toxicity), or upon 
administration of second line treatment with resulting interaction (e.g., 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole use increasing systemic exposure to methotrexate due to 
decrease renal clearance).6  Additional late onset toxicities related to prior ALL 
chemotherapy include loss of active immunization, infertility, secondary cancers, and 
diabetes, avascular necrosis, and/or osteoporosis secondary to steroid treatment.22
Other Co-morbidities
Adult ALL patients are expected to experience common age-related co-morbid conditions.  
At diagnosis, the adult age distribution of ALL in the US SEER database was 20-34 years 
(24.2%), 35-44 years (13.5%), 45-54 years (14.9%), 55-64 years (18.3%), 65-74 years 
(16.5%), 75-84 years (9.0%), and 85+ (3.6%).8 Common age-related conditions such as 
cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension), obesity, hepatic steatosis, tobacco, ethanol and/or 
illicit drug exposure, or hepatitis that are prevalent in the general adult population are present 
in many adult patients prior to treatment.  Saillard et al.27 reported cardiovascular disease in 
58 (65%) of 89 patients newly diagnosed with ALL.  Prior other malignancy had occurred in 
19 patients (21%) often requiring surgery, chemotherapy, and/or irradiation therapy.  Terwey 
et al.26 reported cardiovascular diseases in 6 (4%) of 151 ALL patients awaiting HSCT.  
Pulmonary disease was present in 47 (31%) cases (28% moderate, 3% severe).  Psychiatric 
disturbances were reported in 11 patients (7%).26

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
The nonclinical safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  Rats and monkeys are considered to be relevant biological 
species only for potential target-independent toxicities associated with conjugated and 
unconjugated calicheamicin because the anti CD22-antibody (G544 antibody) component of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin does not bind to the target antigen CD22 in any nonclinical species.  
Consistent with the intended clinical route of administration, the majority of the toxicity 
studies were conducted using the IV route.  Repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 26 weeks of 
duration (1 dose/week) were conducted and were considered relevant to the recommended 
clinical dosing regimen, (i.e., the first cycle being a 21- to 28-day cycle with 3 divided doses 
on Days 1, 8 and 15, followed by 28-day cycles consisting of 3 doses divided on Day 1, 8 
and 15 followed by 7 treatment free days and a maximum of 6 cycles).  In addition, safety 
pharmacology, genetic toxicity, fertility and early embryonic development, and embryo-
foetal development studies were conducted.
Based on the nonclinical safety studies conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin, the primary 
toxicities occurred in the liver, haematolymphopoietic tissues, and reproductive organs.  
Embryo-foetal effects were also identified from rat fertility and rat and rabbit embryo-foetal 
development studies.  Other inotuzumab ozogamicin-related effects identified following 
repeat dosing included kidney findings in rats and monkeys, and peripheral and CNS effects 
in rats only.  Inotuzumab ozogamicin was also identified as a clastogen and potential 
carcinogen.  The observed findings were attributed to target-independent toxicity associated 
with conjugated and/or unconjugated calicheamicin.  No new important target organ 
toxicities were observed in single and repeat-dose rat and dog studies with N-acetyl--
calicheamicin DMH.  There was no toxicity observed in rats or monkeys administered repeat 
doses of G544 antibody alone, as would be expected because the G544 antibody does not 
bind CD22 in nonclinical species including rats and monkeys.  
Table 5 describes the nonclinical key safety findings and relevance to human usage.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin has the potential 
to cause elevations in liver-related 
laboratory tests and hepatotoxicity.
Grade ≥3 and/or serious hepatotoxicity, 
including all VOD/SOS is an important 
identified risk (for further information see 
Module SVII.3.1).
Findings (From Nonclinical Studies)
Liver
Dose related increases in AST and/or ALT were observed in rats 
and monkeys following single or repeated dosing.  Increases in 
total bilirubin were observed in monkeys after a single dose but 
not after repeat dosing.  Microscopic changes associated with 
4 weeks repeated administration in rats included sinusoidal 
dilatation with hepatocyte atrophy, hepatocyte hypertrophy and 
karyomegaly, and angiectasis.  In monkeys, sinusoidal dilatation, 
hepatocyte atrophy, and hepatocellular hypertrophy were 
observed after 26 weeks of repeated dosing.  Increases in AST 
and/or ALT and histopathological changes including sinusoidal 
dilatation with damage/loss of SECs and accompanied by 
sequestration of platelets along with multifocal hepatocyte 
hypertrophy were consistent with microvascular liver injury and 
were considered to represent early stages of VOD/SOS and NRH, 
morphologically similar to those reported in clinical trials.

Findings (From Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Usage
Inotuzumab ozogamicin has the potential 
to cause myelosuppression/cytopenia in 
humans.  Myelosuppression/cytopenia is 
an important identified risk (for further 
information see Module SVII.3.1).
Inotuzumab ozogamicin has the potential 
to impair human male and female 
fertility, to adversely affect human 
embryo-foetal development, and to 
potentially affect the nursing infant.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
(post exposure during pregnancy and 
while breast feeding) is an important 
potential risk (for further information, see 
Module SVII.3.1).
Additional findings after repeat dosing in rats and monkeys 
included an altered hepatocyte focus in one monkey and 
preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in rats.  Liver effects 
occurred in studies 4 weeks in duration in rats and in studies 26 
weeks in duration in monkeys at subtherapeutic exposures and 
multiples thereof.  Partial to complete recovery of findings in rats 
was observed following a 4-week non-dosing period but slight to 
mild hepatocellular hypertrophy, increased single cell necrosis, 
and slight karyomegaly were still present.  Preneoplastic and 
neoplastic lesions observed after 26 weeks of dosing in rats 
would not be expected to resolve.  There were no liver-related 
findings in monkeys at the end of a 4-week non-dosing period in 
the 4-week toxicity study.
Haematolymphopoietic
Decreased platelets, RBC mass, and lymphocytes were observed 
in rats and/or monkeys after a single dose and/or in repeat-dose 
studies ≥ 4 weeks in duration.  Acute decreases in platelets in 
monkeys were likely due to sequestration in the liver in 
association with microvascular liver injury.  Haematological 
changes were in part associated with hypocellularity in the bone 
marrow and lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes 
and/or gut-associated lymphoid tissue).  Major haematological 
effects occurred at subtherapeutic exposures and multiples 
thereof, and were partially or fully reversible.
Reproductive and developmental toxicity (post exposure 
during pregnancy and while breast feeding)
Male Reproductive
Dose-related testicular degeneration associated with hypospermia 
and prostatic and seminal vesical atrophy was observed in rats 
given single or repeated-doses in studies 4 weeks at 
subtherapeutic exposures and multiples thereof.  After 4 weeks of 
dosing in the monkey Sertoli cell vacuolation was observed.  
There were no male reproductive effects noted in monkeys after 
26 weeks of dosing; however the male reproductive organs were 
immature in most animals in the repeat-dose toxicity studies and 
a complete assessment could not be conducted.  Recovery from 
testicular degeneration and associated effects were not observed 
in rats after 4 weeks of repeat-dosing and a subsequent 4-week 
non-dosing period.
Female Reproductive
Atrophy of the ovaries, uterus, vagina, and mammary gland 
occurred in rats and/or monkeys in single and/or repeated dose 
studies of 4 weeks in duration.  After a 4-week non-dosing period 
partial to full recovery was observed.  After 26-weeks of dosing, 
the only change in monkeys was slight ovarian atrophy and there 
were no adverse female reproductive organ effects in rats or 
monkeys after 26 weeks of dosing at 2.2x and 3.1x respectively, 
the maximum human clinical exposure.

Relevance to Human Usage
Embryo-foetal toxicity
In fertility studies in female rats and embryo-foetal development 
studies in rats and rabbits, foetal effects, except for foetal weight 
decreases in rats, were only observed at maternally toxic doses.  
Increases in resorptions and concomitant decreases in viable 
embryos in a rat female fertility study were observed.  In 
embryo-foetal development studies in rats, foetal body weights 
were lower and were associated with reduced foetal skeletal 
ossification and increased foetal incidence of short/thick humerus 
and misshapen scapula and/or ulna at subtherapeutic exposure 
and multiples thereof.  The delayed skeletal ossification and other 
foetal morphological effects were considered reversible and a 
consequence of maternal toxicity and foetal growth retardation.  
In rabbits, lower foetal body weights and foetal mortality were 
observed in the presence of significant maternal toxicity in the 
nonpivotal embryo-foetal development study; there were no 
adverse foetal effects in the pivotal rabbit developmental study.  
There were no adverse embryo-foetal effects observed in rats or 
rabbits at 0.1x and 3.2x, respectively, the maximum human 
clinical exposure.  
Nervous System
Peripheral and CNS axonal degeneration was observed following 
4 weeks of repeat dosing in rats at 5.8x the maximum human 
clinical exposure, but not after 26 weeks of dosing at 2.2x the 
maximum human clinical exposure.  After a 4-week non-dosing 
period, the severity of sciatic nerve axonal degeneration was 
increased and axonal degeneration of the cervical spinal cord and 
trigeminal nerve in the brain was still present.  Additionally, 
following the non-dosing period, slight axonal degeneration of 
the lumbar spinal cord was observed.  There were no nervous 
system effects observed in the monkey after single- or repeat-
dose administration up to 26 weeks at 3.1x the maximum human 
clinical exposure.
Renal
After 26 weeks of repeat dosing in rats, chronic progressive 
nephropathy occurred at subtherapeutic clinical exposures and 
margins thereof.  It is unclear whether the nephropathy represents 
an exacerbation of a spontaneous rat-specific lesion with no 
relevance to humans or is a direct effect of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin administration.  One male monkey was euthanized 
during the 26-week study; a protein-losing glomerulonephritis 
was identified as the cause of morbidity at 3.1x the maximum 
human clinical exposure.  The glomerulonephritis was associated 
with protein in the urine, tubular protein casts in the kidney, and 
multisystemic subacute vascular inflammation.  The time course 
and histopathological characteristics of the glomerulonephritis 
and vasculitis are consistent with possible immune complex 
deposition associated with anti-drug antibodies.  
Mutagenicity, Clastogenicity, and Carcinogenicity
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was identified as a clastogen, but not a 
mutagen: N-acetyl--calicheamicin DMH, the released cytotoxin, 
was identified as a mutagen and clastogen.  It is known that -

calicheamicin (the naturally occurring form of calicheamicin) is a 
highly potent DNA-cleaving agent that causes sequence-specific 
double strand cuts.  Consistent with its mechanism of action, 
-calicheamicin is also a potent inducer of chromosome damage 
as measured by the in vitro micronucleus assay and the in vitro 
chromosome aberration assay.
After 26 weeks of administration, hepatocellular adenomas, 
basophilic and/or eosinophilic altered cell foci, and oval cell 
hyperplasia were observed in rats at subtherapeutic exposures 
and multiples thereof.  Oval cell hyperplasia was also observed in 
rats after a single dose or after 4 weeks of repeated-dose 
administration.  A focus of hepatocellular alteration was 
observed in one female monkey after 26 weeks of dosing at 3.1x 
the maximum human clinical exposure.  Foci of altered 
hepatocytes are uncommon spontaneous findings in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  Although foci of altered hepatocytes are considered 
preneoplastic changes in laboratory rodents, the aetiology and 
relationship to the development of neoplasia in nonhuman 
primates are unknown.  Preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions 
observed after 26 weeks of dosing in rats would not be expected 
to resolve.  The dose where no effects were observed in monkeys 
and the LOAEL in rats provided subtherapeutic exposure and 
margins thereof.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity
The conduct of juvenile animal toxicity studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin, (where such 
studies can only be used to evaluate target-independent toxicity associated with the released 
cytotoxin N-acetyl--calicheamicin DMH), would not be anticipated to provide additional 
information relevant to the safety or benefit risk profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
paediatric populations beyond the data that has been presented in this risk management plan.  
Therefore, juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Other Nonclinical Data
No additional nonclinical studies are considered necessary to support the use of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in the intended target population.

Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
This RMP focuses on the safety findings from 2 studies in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL: pivotal randomised Phase 3 Study B1931022 (hereinafter referred to 
as Study 10223) and supportive Phase 1/2 Study B1931010 (hereinafter referred to as Study 
1010).  This RMP also summarises safety findings from 9 studies in patients with relapsed or 
refractory NHL treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin as a single agent, in combination with 
rituximab, or in combination with rituximab plus chemotherapy.  
Overall, a total of 1207 adult patients were treated in Pfizer-sponsored studies (Phases 1 
to 3), including 880 (72.9%) patients who received at least 1 dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
323 (26.8%) patients who received a comparator drug or drug regimen, and 4 (0.3%) patients 
who received only rituximab in studies of patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.  Of the 
880 patients who received at least 1 dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin in Pfizer-sponsored 
studies, 236 patients were from ALL studies with single-agent inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
173 patients were from NHL studies with single-agent inotuzumab ozogamicin, 368 patients 
were from NHL studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with rituximab, and 
103 patients were from the NHL study with inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with 
rituximab plus multiagent chemotherapy. 
ALL studies with single-agent inotuzumab ozogamicin (Studies 1022 and 1010)
Study 1022 is a randomised (1:1) open label Phase 3 study in which patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL due to receive either Salvage 1 or 2 therapy4 were randomised to 
receive treatment with either inotuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy or a defined 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hereinafter referred to as the “control arm” or ‘control 
therapy’).  
In Study 1022, 326 patients were randomised; 307 patients were treated: 164 patients 
received inotuzumab ozogamicin and 143 patients received 1 of 3 standard chemotherapy 
regimens in the control arm.  Patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm received study 
medication on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-28 day cycle for up to 6 cycles.  Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was administered with a starting recommended total dose of 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle 
administered as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) 
and subsequent cycles as a recommended total dose of 1.5 mg/m2 per cycle, administered as 
3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.5 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who 
achieved a CR or CRi, or 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle administered as 3 divided doses on Days 1 
(0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who did not achieve a CR or 
CRi.  Patients in the control arm were treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-
3 Across the inotuzumab ozogamicin clinical development programme each clinical study number consists 
of the clinical project number (e.g., ‘B193’) followed by a unique study number (e.g., ‘1003’); hence 
‘B1931003’.  For simplicity, throughout the RMP, each protocol is referred to by just the study number (e.g., 
‘Study 1003’).  However, the full protocol number appears in some tables.

after initial treatment. Salvage 2 is defined as morphological relapse after Salvage 1 therapy or resistant disease 
(no CR or CRi) after Salvage 1.

colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG), MXN + Ara-C, or HIDAC.  FLAG dosing 
consisted of 5 to 6 days of cytarabine (2 g/m2/day) and 5 days of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) 
with G-CSF for a 28 day cycle for up to 4 cycles.  Dosing with MXN + Ara-C consisted of 
mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2/day) for 3 days and cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day IV by continuous 
infusion over 7 days) per cycle for up to 4 cycles, with mitoxantrone dose modification based 
on patient age, comorbidities, and prior anthracycline use.  HIDAC dosing consisted of 
cytarabine at 3 g/m2 IV over 1-3 hours every 12 hours for up to 12 doses per cycle for up to 2 
cycles with dose modifications for age and organ dysfunction.  Of the 143 patients who 
received 1 of 3 standard chemotherapy regimens in the control arm: 93 patients received 
FLAG, 33 patients received MXN + Ara-C, and 17 patients HIDAC. 
In Study 1010, a Phase 1/2 study, 72 patients received inotuzumab ozogamicin at dose levels 
of 1.2–1.8 mg/m2/cycle.  There were 3 parts to this study: Phase 1 dose escalation, Phase 1 
dose expansion, and Phase 2:



In the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion, 24 patients received inotuzumab ozogamicin at 
dose levels of 1.2 mg/m2/cycle (N=3), 1.6 mg/m2/cycle (N=12), and 1.8 mg/m2/cycle 
(N=9).  No dose reductions due to achieving CR or CRi after cycle 1 were allowed. 
In the Phase 1 dose expansion, additional experience was gained at the 1.8 mg/m2 per 28-
day for cycle; however, in contrast to the dose escalation patients, in the dose expansion 
part of the study a dose reduction to 1.6 mg/m2/cycle occurred if CR or CRi was achieved 
(N=13).
In the Phase 2 portion, patients were treated with a similar regiment to the Phase 1 dose 
expansion portion: 1.8 mg/m2 per 28-day for cycle 1, followed by a dose reduction to 
1.6 mg/m2/cycle if CR or CRi was achieved (N=35).
NHL studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin alone or in combination with rituximab with or 
without chemotherapy (Studies B1931001, B1931002, B1931003, B1931004, B1931005, 
B1931006, B1931007, B1931008, and B1931016)
A total of 644 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL received inotuzumab ozogamicin as 
detailed above.  
Other Considerations
 Eight (8) clinical studies in the inotuzumab ozogamicin clinical development programme 
have a Pfizer study number and a corresponding Wyeth study number (Wyeth is now a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.).  For simplicity, throughout the RMP, each study 
is referred to using the Pfizer protocol number.  Please see Annex 7 for a listing of these 
studies.
 Throughout this RMP, studies in which inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered as a 
single-agent are referred to as “single-agent studies” and studies where inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was administered as a component of rituximab and multiagent chemotherapy 
are referred to as “combination studies.”

Paediatric relapsed/refractory CD22-positive ALL study with inotuzumab ozogamicin as a 
single agent and in combination with chemotherapy (Study ITCC-059)
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was also being utilised in Study ITCC-059 (WI203581) “A phase 
I/II study of inotuzumab ozogamicin as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy 
for paediatric CD22-positive relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia”. This is a 
non-Pfizer Sponsored ongoing Phase 1-2, multicenter, international, single-arm, multi-
cohort, open-label study in paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL, part of an 
approved EU PIP (EMEA-001429-PIP01-13-M06). The objectives of this study were to 
identify the recommended dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin administered IV either as 
monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B) for paediatric 
patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL, and to estimate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
the selected RP2D of monotherapy inotuzumab ozogamicin dose, and to evaluate PK and PD 
in this patient population.
Paediatric participants (≥1 and <18 years) with relapsed (2nd or greater relapse or first relapse 
after transplant)/refractory CD22-positive BCP-ALL were enrolled in this study. A total of 
85 participants were assigned to treatment and 83 participants were treated. The total dose of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin per cycle mentioned hereafter refers to Cycle 1 mainly.
 Stratum 1A: 25 participants were treated; 12 received inotuzumab ozogamicin
1.4 mg/m2/cycle (DL1) and 13 received inotuzumab ozogamicin 1.8 mg/m2/cycle 
(DL2). 
 Phase 2 Cohort: 28 participants received inotuzumab ozogamicin 1.8 mg/m2/cycle.
 Stratum 1B: 30 participants were treated:
o inotuzumab ozogamicin was given at an initial starting dose of 1.1 mg/m2/cycle, 
combined with UKALL-R3 modified regimen 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 3, 10, 17 and 24; 
oral dexamethasone 20 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5 and 15-19, divided in 2 daily doses, 
and IT methotrexate prophylaxis on Days 1 and 8.
o Due to 2 out of 4 participants at this 1.1 mg/m2/cycle dose level experienced DLTs, 
the dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin was de-escalated to 0.8 mg/m2/cycle while 
awaiting approval of Study ITCC-059 Protocol Amendment 4 which supported 
re-escalation of inotuzumab ozogamicin to 1.1 mg/m2 during C1; 6 participants 
received inotuzumab ozogamicin combined with a reduced dose of dexamethasone 
at 10 mg/m2/day (amended mR3). Next, 3 participants received inotuzumab 
ozogamicin 1.4 mg/m2/cycle + amended mR3. Finally, 10 participants received 
inotuzumab ozogamicin 1.8 mg/m2/cycle + amended mR3. A total of 19 
participants were treated with the reduced dose of dexamethasone.
For the purposes of this RMP, “a completed” study signifies that the final analysis of the 
primary endpoint(s) has been completed and a final CSR is available; however, patients may 
still be in follow-up for overall survival and late safety events.  “Ongoing” study signifies 
Page 32
that the final analysis of all the primary endpoint(s) has not been completed and a final CSR 
is not available.
The clinical exposure data summarised below are based upon:
 Data pooled based on indication, dosage and combination therapy for the following 11 
completed Pfizer-sponsored clinical studies in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL 
and NHL (the safety cohorts for evaluation are presented below):
o Study 1022 is considered to be completed.  A CSR is available that reports the 
analysis of the primary endpoint of CR/CRi and secondary endpoints (based on the 
initial 218 patients randomised), and safety (based on 259 patients treated out of 
279 randomised by the data cutoff of 02 October 2014).  A sCSR is available 
reporting the analysis of the primary endpoint of OS, an updated analysis of 
CR/CRi, secondary endpoints, and safety based on all 326 randomised patients.  A 
data cutoff date of 08 March 2016 was used for the sCSR.   
o Study 1010 is considered to be completed and the safety database lock date of 26 
April 2016 is the data extraction date at the end of this Pfizer-sponsored clinical 
study with 15 January 2016 as the last subject last visit date.
o The 9 NHL Pfizer sponsored studies (B1931001, B1931002, B1931003, B1931004, 
B1931005, B1931006, B1931007, B1931008, and B1931016) are considered 
completed and the safety data cutoff date is the data extraction date at the end of the 
respective Pfizer-sponsored clinical study.

Safety Cohorts for Evaluation in the RMP
ALL Cohorts
Pooled ALL all dose levels cohort (N=236) comprised of the following:

164 inotuzumab ozogamicin-treated patients in Study 1022, as of the safety cutoff date 
of 08 March 2016, plus
Page 33

72 patients in Study 1010 as of the database lock date of 26 April 2016.



164 inotuzumab ozogamicin-treated patients in Study 1022, as of the safety cutoff date 
of 08 March 2016, plus
48 of the 72 patients in Study 1010 as of the database lock date of 26 April 2016.  The 
48 patients from Study 1010 included all patients who received 1.8 mg/m2/cycle 
inotuzumab ozogamicin as a single-agent during Cycle 1, with a protocol-specified 
dose reduction for subsequent cycles upon achievement of CR/CRi (all patients from 
the dose expansion portion [N=13] plus all patients from the Phase 2 portion [N=35]).
Dose escalation ALL 1.8 mg/m2 cohort (N=9) comprised of patients within the dose 
escalation phase of Study 1010 who received 1.8 mg/m2/cycle of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
without a protocol-specified subsequent dose reduction regimen for patients who achieve 
CR/CRi.  These 9 patients were not added to the pooled ALL 1.8 mg/m2 cohort (N=212) 
described above as they could not be compared to this patient population; however, safety 
data for these 9 patients are separately described in the RMP. 
In addition to the ALL cohorts noted above, data for each of the Study 1022 treatment arms 
is displayed for selected parameters as specified in Module SVII.3.

Prior use of anti-CD22 
immunotherapy is not expected 
to have any impact on the 
toxicity or efficacy of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin if 
CD22 remains expressed on the 
B cells.  Therefore, the 
Applicant has no reason to 
hypothesize an unfavourable

inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
patients with prior other anti-
CD22 immunotherapy 4

Patients must not have Grade 
2 acute GVHD or extensive 
chronic GVHD and must 
have completed

The Applicant acknowledges 
that active GVHD is likely to 
increase the risk of any 
therapy.  However, the 
Applicant has no data to 
consider this risk would be 
worse for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin than other 
therapies.  GVHD should be 
controlled before any treatment 
if possible.  If the patient has 
liver GVHD, this would qualify 
as active hepatic disease.  In 
the label, patients with serious 
ongoing hepatic disease are 
contraindicated from treatment 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin.

Discussion of Implications for 
Target Population
Common events (occurring in 
>1/100 patients) may be 
identified; however, uncommon or 
rare ADRs may have not been 
observed in clinical trials.
The implications of the relative 
lack of knowledge about the 
safety profile of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in Hispanic and Black 
patients are unknown.  However, 
based on a population PK analysis 
in patients with relapsed or 
refractory ALL, race and ethnic 
origin was not identified as a 
significant factor affecting 
inotuzumab ozogamicin clearance.
Studies using prolonged exposure 
of inotuzumab ozogamicin are not 
currently planned.  The 
implications of not having long-
term data are not expected to have 
a major impact in this patient 
population because this treatment 
is designed for induction (short 
term) therapy and not for long 
term dosing.  Based on data from 
Study 1022, most patients are 
expected to respond within 3 
cycles.  
The implication of not having 
cumulative effect data are 
expected not to have a major 
impact in this patient population 
because this treatment is designed 
for induction (short term) therapy 
and not for long-term repeat 
dosing.  
Limitation of Trial Programme
As of 26 April 2016, 
approximately 880 subjects/ 
patients received inotuzumab 
ozogamicin given either as a 
single-agent or as a component of 
combination therapy in Pfizer-
sponsored clinical studies.  As of 
30 June 2016, 307 patients from 
investigator-initiated research 
(IIR) studies and approximately 
211 patients from compassionate 
use received inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.  
Hispanic and Black patients have 
been underrepresented in clinical 
studies of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.  Therefore, it is not 
known whether the AE profile in 
those (and other) racial and/or 
ethnic groups is different from 
that seen in White and Asian 
patients.
Generally, dosing of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin has been limited to a 
maximum of 6 cycles for ALL.  
Of the 880 subjects/patients who 
have been exposed to inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in Pfizer-sponsored 
studies, 9 patients received 7-8 
months of therapy and 2 patients 
received >8 months of therapy, 
therefore, there is little experience 
with dosing beyond 8 cycles.  In 
ALL studiesa, dosing was limited 
to 6 cycles.

That are dose related
Limitation of Trial Programme
Since the period of observation for 
patients treated with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin may be confounded 
by subsequent HSCT or by 
initiation of subsequent 
chemotherapy and/or radiation 
therapy; the information regarding 
potential AEs with a long latency 
is limited.
In the Phase I ALL dose 
escalation part of Study 1010, 
doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
ranging from 1.2 mg/m2/cycle to 
1.8 mg/m2/cycle were evaluated; 
however, doses above 1.8 
mg/m2/cycle were not evaluated in 
ALL studies.  In NHL studiesb
doses above 1.8 mg/m2/cycle were 
evaluated and a MTD was 
established as 1.8 mg/m2/cycle.
Discussion of Implications for 
Target Population
Implications of not having data on 
long latency on inotuzumab 
ozogamicin therapy are expected 
to not have a major impact.
Acknowledging the different 
dosing regimens of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin used in ALL studies 
(divided/weekly dosing as 
opposed to once monthly dosing 
in NHL studies) as well as 
decreased bone marrow function 
in patients with ALL, based on the 
observed DLTs with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin treatment in NHL, 
there is a potential for increased 
risk of haematologic and hepatic 
toxicities above the recommended 
dosing for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.

There are no data on the presence of inotuzumab ozogamicin or its 
metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed children, 
or the effects on milk production in women treated with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin.  There is a potential risk of exposure to 
the breast-fed child if breast-feeding occurs during treatment with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin and for at least 2 months after the final 
dose (based on 5 times the inotuzumab ozogamicin half-life (i.e.,

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, 
the clearance of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with hepatic

with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin/AST ≤ ULN; 
n=611). In 3 patients with hepatic impairment defined by NCI 
ODWG category C (total bilirubin > 1.5 3 × ULN and AST any 
level) and 1 patient with hepatic impairment defined by NCI 
ODWG category D (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and AST any level), 
inotuzumab ozogamicin clearance did not appear to be reduced.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required when administering 
inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients with mild hepatic impairment.
No formal PK studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been 
conducted in patients with renal impairment.

No adjustment to the starting dose is required when administering 
inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients with mild, moderate, or severe

Studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin for treatment of ALL excluded 
those patients with impaired cardiac function; therefore, the safety 
and efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been established 
in patients with this relevant co-morbidity.
Not included in the clinical development programme.
Salvage Status
In the Study 1022, enrolled patients were due to receive either 
Salvage 1 or Salvage 2 therapy.  More heavily pretreated
individuals are likely to represent patients with more 
persistent/resistant disease, more persisting chemotherapy-related 
toxicities, and/or may have more toxicities with subsequent 
therapies, compared to salvage 1 or 2 patients.  The activity of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin in more resistant disease could be 
different from the efficacy profile observed in the Study 1022 
clinical trial population.  
Number of prior relapses has been a factor associated with poorer 
outcomes in relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL patients.25  Similarly, 
inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment in heavily pretreated patients 
could show different safety outcomes compared to those observed 
in the Study 1022 clinical trial population. 
Although not included in Study 1022, safety and efficacy data for 
more heavily pretreated patients is available from Study 1010.  Of 
the 72 enrolled patients in this study, 16 were Salvage 1, 29 were 
Salvage 2, and 27 were Salvage 3, 4, 5, or higher.  In an efficacy 
analysis by salvage line (1, 2 or 3+) for patients enrolled in Study 
1010, salvage status did not appear to be a significant determinant 
of remission rate (CR/CRi rates of 75%, 62% and 70% for Salvage 
1, 2 and 3+ patients, respectively).  This indicates that even 
multiple relapsed/refractory ALL patients can respond to treatment 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin.
In Study 1022, Grade >3 and higher hepatotoxicity adverse events 
were more frequently reported in Salvage 2 compared to Salvage 1 
patients (41.2% versus 23.4%, respectively).  Therefore, while 
patients who have been heavily pretreated (e.g., patients in later 
lines of therapy) may have additional toxicity due to prior 
therapies, patients in later lines (Salvage 3+) have responded to

treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and subsequently 
proceeded to HSCT.
Higher Baseline Peripheral Blast Counts 
As an antibody drug conjugate, disposition of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin following IV administration is influenced by 
interaction with CD22-positive B-lymphocytes, and in part to 
binding with neonatal FcRN.31  Interaction of protein therapeutics 
with their cognate targets is generally associated with target-
mediated disposition.  For inotuzumab ozogamicin, this process 
was characterised in the population PK analysis using both a 
linear- and a time-dependent component of clearance.  Reduced 
exposure resulting from higher clearance in some patients could 
reduce efficacy.  In addition, patients with higher blast counts 
could have a higher risk for certain toxicities, including infusion 
reactions and tumour lysis syndrome.  However, in study 1022, 
higher baseline peripheral blast count was associated with a lower 
risk of grade 3 and higher hepatotoxicity and while infusion 
reactions and tumour lysis syndrome were reported, there were no 
grade 5 events and no discontinuations due to infusion reactions or
tumour lysis syndrome.  Furthermore, based on a subgroup 
analysis of patients with a baseline peripheral blast count 
>1,000/mL, patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm also had a 
statistically significant higher CR/CRi rate than the control arm.  
As such, although there is a theoretical reduced benefit-risk in 
patients with higher baseline peripheral blast counts, this was not 
observed among patients enrolled in Study 1022. 
In Study 1022, eligibility required peripheral absolute lymphoblast 
counts <10,000/mL.  In order to reduce white blood cell counts, 
the protocol allowed cytoreduction with hydroxyurea and/or 
steroids/vincristine within 2 weeks of randomisation.  Among the 
first 218 subjects randomised in Study 1022, approximately 28% 
and 17% of inotuzumab ozogamicin and control arm subjects, 
respectively, received cytoreductive therapy within 2 weeks prior 
to randomisation.
Higher baseline peripheral blast counts have been reported to be a 
prognostic factor associated with poor outcome in ALL patients 
with relapsed or refractory ALL.32   
Hispanic (N=14) and Black (N=22) patients (see Table 9), have 
been underrepresented in clinical studies with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, therefore, it is not known whether the safety profile in 
those (and other) racial and/or ethnic groups is different from that 
seen in White and Asian patients.  However, the general safety 
profile of these underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups is 
similar to the overall safety profile for inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
although the small number of patients available for analysis makes 
it difficult to compare safety profiles of these individual racial

and/or ethnic groups to the overall safety profile for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.
In vitro, N-acetyl--calicheamicin DMH was primarily 
metabolised via non-enzymatic reduction and hydrolysis.  
Therefore, polymorphisms or genes encoding drug metabolising 
enzymes, including cytochrome P450s and uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, are not expected to 
substantially impact drug clearance.33
No known polymorphism impacting a response to inotuzumab 
ozogamicin has been reported.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was developed as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-
cell precursor ALL. Adult patients with Ph+ relapsed or refractory 
B-cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 
TKI.  Patients <18 years have not been studied; therefore, the 
safety and efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients <18 
years of age have not been established.  
However, as of 30 June 2016, approximately 525 paediatric 
patients have received inotuzumab ozogamicin in compassionate 
access/named patient access programmes and IIR studies.  Ages 
ranged from 2 to 17 years with a mean of 11.3 years and a median 
of 11.0 years (n=51).  Based on this limited data and taking into 
consideration the difficulties in comparing clinical trial data to 
data obtained from compassionate access/named patient access 
programmes and IIR studies, the safety profile of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in these paediatric patients appears similar to the 
safety profile in adult patients.  The SAEs reported for these 
paediatric patients are the same overall pattern of SAEs reported 
for adult patients, e.g., mostly febrile neutropenia, fever, and 
infection.  There were 2 events of VOD/SOS reported in children 
and each occurred after a follow-up HSCT; one event of VOD was 
fatal, however, overall the frequency of VOD/SOS in this limited 
analysis was not higher than that reported in adults.  Refer to 
Annex 7 for the frequency of VOD/SOS occurring during 
treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin in studies 1022 and 1010.
Two Clinical Research Collaboration studies include paediatric 
patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, as described in the 
approved inotuzumab ozogamicin Paediatric Investigational Plan 
(PIP).  These include:

UKALLR3 regimen) with or without inotuzumab ozogamicin 
in patients aged 1 to < 18 years who experience a first early 
relapse of B-cell ALL.  This study is planned to start after the 
Phase 1/2 study above is completed.
In Study 1022, 30/164 (18.3%) patients treated with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin were ≥65 years of age. 
Overall, the frequency of AEs, SAEs, and permanent 
discontinuations due to AEs was similar among patients <65 
versus ≥65 years of age though the number of patients ≥65 years 
of age from which to make this comparison was relatively small 
(30/164 [18.3%]).  There were no noteworthy age-related 
haematology or clinical chemistry differences for patients <65 
years versus ≥65 years of age.  Low-grade electrolyte 
abnormalities were observed but there were no significant 
differences between the age groups.  The liver-related laboratory 
test abnormalities results were numerically higher in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with the control arm yet 
there were no consistent differences in liver-related test 
abnormalities between the age groups.  Moreover, a multivariate 
analysis examining the association between baseline patient 
characteristics and post-SCT VOD/SOS showed that there was a 
statistically significant association between patients aged 55 and 
older with post-HSCT VOD/SOS, indicating that older patients 
may be at higher risk for post-HSCT VOD/SOS.
Please refer to Table 8 and Table 19 for exposure information in 
the elderly participants in the 11 completed Pfizer-sponsored 
clinical studies in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL and 
NHL reported in Module SIII and study B1931030, respectively.
Module SV. Post-Authorisation Experience
SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
Cumulatively through 15 February 2023, it is estimated that 9120 patients worldwide were 
exposed to inotuzumab ozogamicin commercially since the product was first approved.
Page 64
SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The cumulative estimate of the number of patients worldwide who were exposed to the 
commercial formulation of inotuzumab ozogamicin were calculated based on the North
America and IDM countries and EM countries methodologies presented below, respectively.
The estimated exposure data by age group and gender are not available.
North America and IDM countries
The North America and IDM countries exposure is based on audited pharmacy and 
wholesaler sale of inotuzumab ozogamicin extracted from Midas database. 
For the cumulative period, the North America and IDM countries market experience 
information is based on standard units sold from the IBD to 31 December 2022 and 
extrapolated till the end of reporting period. The sales from 01 January 2023 to 15 February 
2023 have been extrapolated by taking the average of sales of previous 4 months.
EM countries
The EM countries exposure is based on the Sales LCD & Standard Units extracted from 
Midas database at country and strength level for inotuzumab ozogamicin from the first 
quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2022 extrapolated till 15 February 2023 for the cumulative 
period by taking the average of previous 4 quarters, along with the internal sales data from 
2019 to Sep 2022 for the cumulative period.
For the EM countries exposure, the total sales LCD is divided by the total Standard unit sales 
on a country basis to obtain the country wise unit cost. The average mg is calculated based on 
the dose information available for each country separately. In order to obtain the total 
volume, the internal sales data is divided by the country wise unit cost. Further, the country 
wise total volume is multiplied with the average mg to obtain mg volume. The country wise 
total mg volume is divided by AVDOS 8.5 vials to obtain EM countries’ patient exposure for 
the cumulative period.
SV.1.2. Exposure
North America and IDM countries
Cumulatively through 15 February 2023, the sales of 62,151 standard units have been 
divided by AVDOS 8.5 vials to obtain North America and IDM countries patient exposure of 
7312 patients, out of which 1709 patients are from EU. 
Cumulative estimated exposure for North America, and IDM countries based on total SU 
sales from IBD through 15 February 2023, is summarised in Table 26.

Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes
The potential for patient-initiated misuse is unlikely; patients do not self-administer 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, the product is prescribed by oncology specialists and generally 
administered in a haematology clinic/hospital setting, and access to inotuzumab ozogamicin 
is restricted to healthcare professionals.  Additionally, inotuzumab ozogamicin does not have 
characteristics that would make it attractive for illegal use.  There is no data available on the 
potential for drug abuse or dependence with inotuzumab ozogamicin or elevation of mood 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin use.  Finally, based on results of tissue distribution studies 
using [3H] inotuzumab ozogamicin in male Sprague-Dawley rats after a single IV dose of 
1.88 mg/m2, 62.8 µCi/kg, minimal penetration of an intact blood brain barrier to CNS tissues 
is anticipated as radioequivalents in the brain were <2% of those in plasma.
Module SVII. Identified and Potential Risks
SVII.1. Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission
Not applicable as this is not an initial version of the RMP.
SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP
Not applicable.
SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
Important Identified Risk: Grade ≥3 and/or Serious Hepatotoxicity, including all 
VOD/SOS
Risk-benefit impact: Inotuzumab ozogamicin is contraindicated in patients who have 
experienced prior confirmed severe or ongoing VOD/SOS and patients with serious ongoing 
hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, active hepatitis).
Important Identified Risk: Myelosuppression / Cytopenia
Risk-benefit impact: in addition to the haematologic abnormalities resulting from relapsed or 
refractory ALL, such patients may have additional haematopoietic susceptibility to cytotoxic 
therapies if there is pre-existing bone marrow suppression (e.g., due to prior chemotherapy, 
prior HSCT, radiation, other therapies), or may experience side effects of other concomitant 
medications or procedures.
Important Potential Risk: Interstitial lung disease
Risk-benefit impact: Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of 
developing ILD/pneumonitis may include a history of pre-existing pulmonary disease, prior 
or concomitant treatment with medications with known pulmonary toxicity [antibiotics (e.g., 
nitrofurantoin, amphotericin B, minocycline); chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, methotrexate, 
cyclophosphamide); antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), and tamoxifen], and other treatments 
Page 68
or circumstances, including radiation therapy, immune suppression resulting in pneumonia 
(bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal), a predisposition to allergic pulmonary disease, 
autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), 
occupational exposure (e.g., smoke, dust, silicone, asbestos),  or other factors.
Important Potential Risk: Inflammatory Gastrointestinal Events
Risk-benefit impact: Patients receiving therapy for refractory leukemia, particularly those 
receiving anti-leukemic therapy, are susceptible to GI inflammation, including gastritis, 
colitis and/or typhlitis.  
Important Potential Risk: Pancreatitis
Risk-benefit impact: Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of 
developing pancreatitis include a variety of medications, (e.g., prior exposure to 
asparaginase, antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, anti-hypertensives, aminosalicylates, 
diuretics, proton-pump inhibitors, steroids, anaesthetics, antibiotics), alcohol abuse, 
hepatobiliary disorders (e.g., obstruction of the common bile duct, idiopathic biliary sludge, 
common bile duct tumour infiltration), post-operative trauma and instrumentation (e.g., 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography), hypercalcaemia, parenchymal tumour 
infiltration, and infection.
Important Potential Risk: Second Primary Malignancy
Risk-benefit impact: Patients with prior or ongoing malignancies and those exposed to 
aggressive chemotherapy, radiation or other significant immunosuppressive therapies may be 
at higher risk for development of additional malignancies.
Important Potential Risk: Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity (post exposure 
during pregnancy and while breast feeding)
Risk-benefit impact: Based on findings in animals and the known mechanism of action of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment can cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman.  The risks to breastfeeding are not known.
Important Potential Risk: Neurotoxicity
Risk-benefit impact: Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of 
neurotoxicity include chemotherapy, drug abuse, heavy metal exposure, pesticides, solvents, 
organic or organometal compounds, certain foods and food additives, radiation exposure, and 
cosmetics.
Important Potential Risk: Nephrotoxicity
Risk-benefit impact: Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of 
nephrotoxicity include drugs, advanced age, haemodynamic status, and underlying disease.
Page 69
Missing information: Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment
Risk-benefit impact: No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have 
been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.
Missing information: Use in patients with severe renal impairment
Risk-benefit impact: No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have 
been conducted in patients with renal impairment.
Missing information: Use in Hispanic and Black patients
Risk-benefit impact: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, race, and gender 
did not significantly affect inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition.  
SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP
Not applicable.
SVII.3. Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
The important identified and potential risks have been determined based on the safety and 
tolerability of inotuzumab ozogamicin in the clinical development programme with the 
characterisation of these risks based primarily on the data from Study 1022 conducted in 
patients with relapsed-refractory B-cell ALL and supportive data from Study 1010 in patients 
with relapsed-refractory B-cell ALL, with additional supplementation of safety data from 9 
clinical studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and 
data from the nonclinical development programme.  Please see Annex 7 for a list of the 
included inotuzumab ozogamicin clinical studies.  Additionally, available data from 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, another ADC with a similar drug design and mechanism of action, 
has been included in the overall risk assessment for inotuzumab ozogamicin.  
The reported TEAE for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL and NHL were used 
to characterise the frequency, severity and nature, and seriousness and outcomes of each 
important risk.
For all the important risks, TEAEs (hereinafter referred to in the RMP as SAEs or AEs) 
included all causality SAEs or AEs that commenced on or after the Cycle 1 Day 1 
(hereinafter Cycle=C, Day=D, i.e., C1D1) but within 42 days of last dose in ALL studies and 
within 56 days of last dose in NHL studies and prior to new anti-cancer treatment in both 
ALL and NHL studies. The post-dosing follow-up interval is 42 days for ALL studies to 
allow additional time beyond the usual 28 day dosing follow up period to capture delayed 
events. The post-dosing follow up interval for NHL is also longer than the usual 28 day 
dosing follow up period to capture delayed events; however, the follow up period in NHL 
studies was extended to 56 days, as denoted in the NHL clinical trial protocols, because NHL 
patients do not usually go to transplant, thus a longer time interval seemed appropriate.
In addition, any VOD/SOS event that began within 2 years after the randomisation date 
regardless of causal attribution to study therapy in ALL studies and any VOD event that 
Page 70
began at any time on or after C1D1 regardless of causal attribution to study therapy in NHL 
studies. Across the ALL and NHL Pfizer-sponsored studies, all VOD/SOS events were 
reported as SAEs regardless of severity. For the ALL studies, all events of VOD/SOS were 
required to be reported for up to 2 years post-randomisation. In the NHL studies, the time 
requirement beyond the study treatment period for VOD/SOS reporting was not specified.
In addition, selected laboratory abnormalities reported in ALL studies that commenced on or 
after C1D1 but within 42 days of last dose and prior to new anti-cancer treatment, were also 
used to characterise the following important identified and potential risks: Grade 3 and/or 
serious hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS, myelosuppression/ cytopenias, pancreatitis, 
and nephrotoxicity.
Of note, hereinafter, when stated, the acronym hepatotoxicity- VOD/SOS will refer to Grade 
3 and/or serious hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS; however, the risk term Grade 3 
and/or serious hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS will be used when naming the 
important identified risk (e.g., section heading, table captions).
SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks
Important identified risks for inotuzumab ozogamicin include Grade 3 and/or serious 
hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS and myelosuppression/cytopenia. 
Important potential risks for inotuzumab ozogamicin include interstitial lung disease, 
inflammatory gastrointestinal events, pancreatitis, second primary malignancy, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity (post exposure during pregnancy and while breast feeding), 
neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity.
Cumulative post-marketing data through 15 February 2023 are presented in the sections 
below (MedDRA version 25.1).

Potential 
mechanisms
Evidence source 
Characterisatio
n of the risk
In nonclinical studies, hepatotoxicity was observed for ADCs that bind or do not bind 
the target antigen, indicating that hepatotoxicity was target-independent.  Increases in 
AST and/or ALT and histopathological changes, including sinusoidal dilation with 
damage/loss of SECs (accompanied by sequestration of platelets) along with multifocal 
hepatocyte hypertrophy, were considered to be the primary important liver findings in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  These findings were consistent with microvascular liver injury 
and were considered to represent early stages of SOS and NRH, morphologically similar 
to those reported in clinical trials.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin clinical and nonclinical studies.
Clinical data
Frequency
All causality events of hepatotoxicity-VOD/SOS occurred in 18.9% (95% CI: 13.6 -
24.1) of patients in pooled ALL studies, 15.0 % (95% CI: 9.7 - 20.4) of patients in 
pooled single-agent NHL studies; 13.3% (95% CI: 9.8 - 16.8) of patients in pooled NHL 
studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with rituximab, and 9.7% (95% CI: 
Page 71
Table 28. Grade ≥3 and/or Serious Hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS
4.0 - 15.4) in the one NHL study with inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with 
rituximab plus chemotherapy6 (refer to Annex 7 for further details).
Seriousness/outcomes and severity
Clinical data on seriousness and outcomes, and an overview of severity of the relevant 
events from clinical data ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 4 are provided in Annex 7.
Cumulative data from the safety database
CT Cases
Cumulatively though 15 February 2023, out of the 1901 CT cases received by the MAH, 
there were 179 cases (9.4%) containing 195 relevant events; the events’ data are 
presented in Annex 7.
Non-CT cases
In the post-marketing experience, since first approval and through 15 February 2023, out 
of the 1956 non-CT cases received by the MAH, there were 441 cases (22.5%) 
containing 526 relevant events. Distribution of event by seriousness and clinical outcome 
is provided in Annex 7.
Background Incidence/Prevalence
The background incidence/prevalence for hepatic or hepatobiliary disorders among 
relapsed refractory B-cell precursor ALL patients is not available as there is no 
unexposed target population. After diagnosis, patients are treated and any untreated 
patients have a very short survival.
Incidence of VOD/SOS after HSCT
While there are generally accepted diagnostic criteria for identifying VOD, there is no 
accepted standard for laboratory, imaging or histologic tests for VOD/SOS.35
Additionally, there is a lack of prospective, large multi-centre clinical trials that include 
specific diagnostic criteria for confirming the diagnosis of VOD/SOS, by contrast the 
relevant clinical studies tend to be small, and risk factors for VOD/SOS are variably 
distributed across treatment arms. As a result, the reported VOD/SOS incidence rates 
vary widely, especially in the early literature, ranging from 0 to 70%.35
The vast majority of VOD/SOS cases occurred in a setting of HSCT.35 With the 
introduction of intravenous busulfan-based regimens, the growing use of reduced-
intensity conditioning in past decades, the reduced incidence of hepatitis C in HSCT 
patients, improved patient selection for HSCT, and better supportive care, the reported 
incidence of VOD/SOS appears to have declined significantly.35
However, the more recently reported VOD/SOS incidence rates (1993-2010) still vary 
widely most likely due to difference in pre-HSCT patient characteristics, conditioning 
regimens, GVHD prophylaxis, donor source36, and supportive care available.35,37 The 
reported incidence of VOD/SOS in children is 5-40%.38 In adults, reported incidence 
rates range from 0% with reduced-intensity conditioning, to 38% with 
cyclophosphamide, TBI at one center,35 and up to 54% in studies involving greater than 
100 patients.39 The reported incidence of VOD/SOS after allogeneic HSCT is 10-15%

Table 28. Grade ≥3 and/or Serious Hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS
following myeloablative conditioning, and as low as 5% or less with non-myeloablative 
or reduced conditioning regimens.
Patient Outcome and Mortality of VOD/SOS
The clinical presentation of VOD/SOS ranges from a mild reversible disease to a severe 
syndrome often associated with MOF.36 The mortality rate of VOD/SOS varies 
according to its severity, with MOF being the cause of death in two thirds of patients 
with VOD/SOS. Severe VOD/SOS, defined as situations where liver damage did not 
resolve before day 100 or the patient died, whichever occurred first, accounts for 18-27% 
of cases.40 Severe VOD/SOS is one of the most common causes of early death after 
allogeneic HSCT, with a mortality rate as high as 80-100% by day +100 post-HSCT in 
adults and slightly lower mortality in children and patients treated with defibrotide.35,36,37
In nonsevere VOD/SOS, reported in 50-80% of VOD/SOS cases, the patient typically 
improves within 17-25 days after onset.40 The VOD/SOS mortality ranged from 3% up 
to 64% in large (>100 patients) studies.41
Incidence of VOD/SOS outside the setting of HSCT
While allogeneic stem cell transplantation and stem cell transplantation are the most 
common causes of VOD/SOS in the Western Hemisphere, VOD/SOS has also been 
described in association with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., actinomycin D, 
mithramycin, dacarbazine, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine), 
therapy for AML with monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 
combination therapy and radiation used in abdominal areas (e.g., such as in children with 
Wilms tumour), and after liver transplantation.42,43
Risk factors and 
risk groups
Refer to Annex 7 for further details on Background incidence/prevalence.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is contraindicated in patients who have experienced prior 
confirmed severe or ongoing VOD/SOS and patients with serious ongoing hepatic 
disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, active hepatitis).
In the following subgroups, the reported frequency of VOD/SOS post-HSCT was ≥50%: 
patients who received a HSCT conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating agents, 
patients aged ≥65 years, and patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ULN prior to HSCT. 
Based on multivariate analysis in Study 1022, patient factors that were significantly 
associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS after a HSCT included the use of HSCT 
conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents and serum bilirubin ≥ULN prior to 
HSCT.
Based on univariate analysis in Study 1022, other patient factors that appeared to be 
associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS after a HSCT include a prior HSCT, age 
≥55 years, a history of hepatic disease and/or hepatitis before treatment, later salvage 
lines, and a greater number of treatment cycles.
Product labeling contraindicates the following patients:

alkylating agents; patients aged ≥65 years; and patients with a serum bilirubin 
≥ULN prior to HSCT;
the use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents should be 
avoided and the benefit/risk should be carefully considered before administering 
inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients in whom the future use of HSCT conditioning 
regimens containing 2 alkylating agents is likely unavoidable;
in patients in whom the serum bilirubin is ≥ULN prior to HSCT, aHSCT post 
inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment should only be undertaken after careful 
consideration of the benefit/risk and that if these patients do proceed to HSCT, 
signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be closely monitored;
other patient factors that appear to be associated with an increased risk of 
VOD/SOS after HSCT include a prior HSCT, age ≥55 years, a history of hepatic 
disease and/or hepatitis before treatment, later salvage lines, and a greater number 
of treatment cycles;
careful consideration is required before administering inotuzumab ozogamicin to 
patients who have had a prior HSCT. No patients with relapsed or refractory ALL 
who were treated with inotuzumab ozogamicinin clinical trials had undergone 
HSCT within the previous 4 months;
patients with a history of hepatic disease should be carefully evaluated (e.g., 
ultrasound scan, viral hepatitis testing) prior to treatment with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin to exclude serious ongoing hepatic disease;
patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of treatment is 2 cycles, 
with a maximum of 3 cycles, to reduce the risk of VOD/SOS;
signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be monitored closely in all patients, 
especially post HSCT;
in all patients, liver tests should be monitored, including, ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, prior to and following each dose of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin;
in patients who develop abnormal liver tests, liver tests and clinical signs and 
symptoms of hepatotoxicity should be monitored more frequently;
for patients who proceed to HSCT, liver tests should be monitored closely during 
the first month post HSCT, then less frequently thereafter, according to standard 
medical practice;
elevation of liver tests may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, or 
permanent discontinuation of inotuzumab ozogamicin;
treatment should be permanently discontinued if VOD/SOS occurs and if severe 
VOD/SOS occurs, the patients should be treated according to standard medical 
practice.
Patients who have experienced prior confirmed severe or ongoing VOD/SOS and 
patients with serious ongoing hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative 
hyperplasia, active hepatitis) should not be treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin significantly increased the risk of VOD/SOS above that of 
standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. This risk 
was most marked in patients who underwent subsequent HSCT.
Patients should be informed that in the following subgroups, the reported frequency of 
VOD/SOS post-HSCT was ≥50%:



Patients who received a HSCT conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating 
agents;
Patients aged ≥65 years; and
Patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN prior to HSCT.

Table 28. Grade ≥3 and/or Serious Hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS
The use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents should be 
avoided. The benefit/risk should be carefully considered before administering 
inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients in whom the future use of HSCT conditioning 
regimens containing 2 alkylating agents is likely unavoidable.
In patients in whom the serum bilirubin is ≥ULN prior to HSCT, HSCT post inotuzumab 
ozogamicin treatment should only be undertaken after careful consideration of the 
benefit/risk. If these patients do proceed to HSCT, signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS 
should be monitored closely.
Other patient factors that appear to be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS 
after HSCT include a prior HSCT, age ≥55 years, a history of hepatic disease and/or 
hepatitis before treatment, later salvage lines, and a greater number of treatment cycles.
Careful consideration is required before administering inotuzumab ozogamicin to 
patients who have had a prior HSCT. No patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who 
were treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin, in clinical trials had undergone HSCT within 
the previous 4 months.
Patients with a history of hepatic disease should be carefully evaluated (e.g., ultrasound 
scan, viral hepatitis testing) prior to treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin to exclude 
serious ongoing hepatic disease.
For patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of treatment is 2 cycles, 
with a maximum of 3 cycles, to reduce the risk of VOD/SOS.
Signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be monitored closely in all patients, especially
post HSCT. Signs may include elevations in total bilirubin, hepatomegaly (which may be 
painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. In all patients, liver tests should be monitored, 
including, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, prior to and following 
each dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests, 
liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity should be monitored more 
frequently. For patients who proceed to HSCT, liver tests should be monitored closely 
during the first month post HSCT, then less frequently thereafter, according to standard 
medical practice. Elevation of liver tests may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, 
or permanent discontinuation of inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Treatment should be permanently discontinued if VOD/SOS occurs. If severe VOD/SOS
occurs, the patient should be treated according to standard medical practice.
The public health impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related serious hepatotoxicity is 
predominantly determined by the frequency of hospitalizations due to life-threatening 
complications (e.g., hepatic failure, VOD/SOS). From the individual point of view, 
VOD/SOS has a significant impact. However, from a public health point of view, it 
would appear to be of low impact because of the relatively low frequency of VOD/SOS 
in the population as a whole.

Characterisatio
n of the risk
As would be expected for an agent that selectively targets cells expressing CD22, 
lymphopenia has also been frequently reported as a treatment-related AE. 
Myelosuppression is one of the toxicities frequently associated with administration of 
agents that induce double-stranded DNA breaks with consequent apoptotic cell death.44
Hence, myelosuppression associated with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment likely 
reflects a combination of both target-dependent and target-independent calicheamicin 
exposure.
In inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy in ALL, such cytotoxicity is superimposed on an 
already infiltrated bone marrow which has sustained microenviromental and cellular 
injury from prior chemotherapy and possibly total body irradiation. Infections are 
common in ALL patients and may induce or exacerbate myelosuppression.
The major haematological changes in nonclinical studies consisted of decreases in RBC 
mass and lymphocytes in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and decreases in platelets in 
monkeys.
Acute thrombocytopenia was considered due to platelet sequestration in the liver 
secondary to inotuzumab ozogamicin-mediated liver-specific endothelial injury; 
however, the mechanism for prolonged platelet effects was uncertain.
Infection
Infection may be a complication of myelosuppression/cytopenia superimposed on an 
already weak immune system due to underlying disease and previously damaged bone 
marrow with limited ability to respond to cytotoxic agents. Cytopenias increase the risk 
of bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Other risk factors for infection may include 
hospitalization and instrumentation, e.g., mucosal injury due to neutropenia or 
chemotherapy-induced mucositis, lack of skin integrity due to IVs, indwelling catheters, 
surgery, and other procedures, and prolonged use of antibiotics that may foster 
colonization by resistant organisms or fungal infections, etc.
Haemorrhage
Haemorrhage may be a complication of myelosuppression/cytopenia with resulting 
thrombocytopenia superimposed on an already damaged bone marrow with limited 
resiliency due to underlying disease or prior cytotoxic therapy. Other factors include 
platelet dysfunction due to drugs (e.g., NSAID), other mechanisms of reduction in 
platelets (e.g., hepatic sequestration), and coagulopathy in cases of infection and/or liver 
dysfunction. Intracranial haemorrhage or thrombosis is fairly common in ALL patients, 
usually during episodes of thrombocytopenia or following therapy with asparaginase.

Cumulative data from the safety database
CT Cases
Cumulatively though 15 February 2023, out of the 1901 CT cases received by the MAH, 
there were 1013 cases (53.3%) containing 1184 relevant events; the events’ data are 
presented in Annex 7.
Non-CT cases
In the post-marketing experience, since first approval and through 15 February 2023, out 
of the 1956 non-CT cases received by the MAH, there were 712 cases (36.4%) 
containing 1259 relevant events. Distribution of event by seriousness and clinical 
outcome is provided in Annex 7.
Background Incidence/Prevalence
The background incidence/prevalence of myelosuppression/cytopenia, including 
infection or haemorrhage among relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL patients, is 
not available as there is no unexposed target population.  After ALL diagnosis all 
patients are treated, and any untreated patients have a very short survival.
At diagnosis of ALL, severe anaemia (Haemoglobin <8 g/dl) is present in 28%, severe 
granulocytopenia (neutrophils <0.5 × 109/l) in 22%, severe thrombocytopenia (platelets 
<25 ×109/l) in 30%, hyperleukocytosis (total white blood cells >10 × 109/l in 59%, >50 × 
109/l in 28%), and detectable circulating blast cells in 92% of cases.22
In addition to the haematologic abnormalities resulting from relapsed or refractory ALL, 
such patients may have additional haematopoietic susceptibility to cytotoxic therapies if 
there is pre-existing bone marrow suppression (e.g., due to prior chemotherapy, prior 
HSCT, radiation, other therapies), or may experience side effects of other concomitant 
medications or procedures.
As myelosuppression/cytopenia is part of the mechanism of action of a cytotoxic agent 
such as calicheamicin, the goal is not specifically aimed toward preventing 
myelosuppression/cytopenias, but rather towards preventing or providing adequate

support for severe or life-threatening myelosuppression/cytopenia.  For example, 
measures might include use of myeloid growth factors such as G-CSF or blood product 
transfusion support with packed red blood cells or platelets, appropriate dose 
modification based on ANC and platelet count, or limiting number of cycles of therapy 
to the minimum needed to provide the appropriate efficacy.
If myelosuppression/cytopenia is Grade 1 or 2, the impact on an individual patient is 
limited.  Severe myelosuppression/cytopenia may predispose patients to serious and/or 
life-threatening infections, multi organ failure/septic shock and/or 
haemorrhage/bleeding.  Depending on the type, severity and duration of the 
myelosuppression/cytopenia, individual patients may require significant haematologic 
support (e.g., red blood cell or platelet transfusions, growth factor support, and 
aggressive medical management of infections and haemorrhage/bleeding events).

Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing ILD/pneumonitis may include a history of pre-existing 
pulmonary disease, prior or concomitant treatment with medications with known pulmonary toxicity [antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, 
amphotericin B, minocycline);  chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide); antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), 
and tamoxifen], and other treatments or circumstances, including radiation therapy, immune suppression resulting in pneumonia 
(bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal), a predisposition to allergic pulmonary disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus 
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), occupational exposure (e.g., smoke, dust, silicone, asbestos), or other factors.
It is not known if patients may be at an increased risk of developing ILD as a result of exposure to inotuzumab ozogamicin.  Thus, there 
are currently no known preventive measures.
Depending on the severity, the impact of ILD on an individual patient may include the potential for permanent loss of pulmonary 
function.  Severe ILD can be a life-threatening event or have a fatal outcome.
The public health impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related ILD is anticipated to be low.

Risk factors and

Preventability
The background incidence/prevalence for of inflammatory GI events among relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL patients is not 
available as there is no unexposed target population.  After diagnosis all patients are treated and any untreated patients have a very short 
survival.
Patients receiving therapy for refractory leukaemia, particularly those receiving anti-leukaemic therapy, are susceptible to GI 
inflammation, including gastritis, colitis and/or typhlitis.  Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing 
inflammatory GI disease may include a history of pre-existing GI abnormalities, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, advanced age, chronic 
illness, and other medications.  Of note, ischemic colitis is more likely to occur in older patients, particularly those with comorbidities 
such as ischemic cardiac disease.  
It is not known which patients may be at an increased risk of developing inflammatory GI events as a result of exposure to inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.  Thus, there are currently no known preventive measures.
12 Multiple episodes of the same event were reported with a different outcome in some cases hence the sum of the events outcome exceeds the total number 
of events.

MedDRA terms
The background incidence/prevalence of pancreatitis among relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL patients is not available as there 
is no unexposed target population.  After ALL diagnosis all patients are treated and any untreated patients have a very short survival.
Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatitis include a variety of medications, (e.g., prior 
exposure to asparaginase,  antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, anti-hypertensives, aminosalicylates, diuretics, proton-pump 
inhibitors, steroids, anaesthetics, antibiotics), alcohol abuse, hepatobiliary disorders (e.g., obstruction of the common bile duct, idiopathic 
biliary sludge, common bile duct tumour infiltration), post-operative trauma and instrumentation (e.g., endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography), hypercalcaemia, parenchymal tumour infiltration, and infection.
It is not known if patients may be at an increased risk of developing pancreatitis as a result of exposure to inotuzumab ozogamicin.  Thus, 
there are currently no known preventive measures.
If pancreatitis is Grade 1 or 2, the impact on an individual patient may be limited.  Severe pancreatitis can be a life-threatening event or 
can have a fatal outcome.
The public health impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related pancreatitis is anticipated to be low.

Evidence source 
Characterisation 
of the risk
Based on nonclinical data, inotuzumab ozogamicin is clastogenic and calicheamicin is genotoxic and clastogenic.  This is consistent with 
the known induction of DNA breaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics.  In rats, preneoplastic lesions were 
observed in the liver after 4 weeks of dosing and neoplastic lesions were observed in the liver after 26 weeks of dosing.  The relevance of 
these animal findings to humans is unknown.  However, due to their mechanism of action (DNA damage), administration of an ADC 
containing calicheamicin may be associated with a potential risk of secondary malignancies.45

Table 33. Second Primary Malignancy
Given the broad search that identified malignant and nonmalignant tumours, the search for second primary malignancy identified all 
causality AEs in 5.7% (95% CI: 2.5 – 8.8) of patients in pooled ALL studies, and in 4.0% (95% CI: 1.1–7.0) of patients in pooled single-
agent NHL studies.  However, of these events, only 1 event of a second primary malignancy was identified (in ALL Study 1010).14
Seriousness/outcomes 
As noted above, in ALL and single-agent NHL studies, there was only 1 event of a second primary malignancy.  In ALL Study 1010, the 
patient experienced the SAE Acute myeloid leukaemia which did not resolve.  Other than this singular event, there were no other reports 
of a second primary malignancy in these studies.
Severity and Nature of Risk
As noted above, in ALL and single-agent NHL studies, there was only 1 event of a second primary malignancy.  In ALL Study 1010, the 
patient experienced Grade 4 Acute myeloid leukaemia.  Other than this singular event, there were no other reports of a second primary 
malignancy in these studies.

Background Incidence/Prevalence
The background incidence/prevalence of secondary primary malignancy among relapsed refractory B-cell precursor ALL is not available 
as there is no unexposed target population.  After diagnosis all patients are treated and any untreated patients have a very short survival.
In a long term follow up study of patients treated for newly diagnosed acute leukaemia, a retrospective chart review was conducted in 34 
patients with ALL and 67 patients with AML that had survived more than 10 years.46 Median follow was 16 years (range 10 – 28 years).  
Twenty-one other malignancies were observed in 19 patients (10 ALL, 9 AML).  The overall median time to development of second 
cancer was 10 years (range 7 months – 21 years) following ALL.  The crude incidence of secondary malignancies was 21% while the 10 
and 20 year cumulative incidence of secondary cancers was 8% and 27%, respectively. 
In a second retrospective study,47 2168 adult ALL patients (median age 38 years, range: 18-93 years) diagnosed between January 1992 
and December 2006 were reviewed from the SEER 13 database.  A total of 35 (1.6%) patients developed 39 secondary primary 
malignancies, an O/E ratio of 1.43 (CI, 1.01-1.95; P=.04).  Median follow-up time was 6.41 years (range, 6 months to 14.21 years).  
Median age of the patients who developed secondary primary malignancy was 57 years (range, 18-87 years).  There was a significantly 
higher risk of lung and bronchial tumours and haematologic malignancies (6 AML and 2 NHL cases).

MedDRA terms
Patients with prior or ongoing malignancies and those exposed to aggressive chemotherapy, radiation or other significant 
immunosuppressive therapies may be at higher risk for development of additional malignancies.
Preventive measures to reduce the incidence of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related second primary malignancy have not been identified.  
Thus, there are currently no known preventive measures.  Early detection of second primary malignancies may afford greater chances for 
treatment or for remission. 
The impact of a second primary malignancy on an individual patient can be a life-threatening event or have a fatal outcome. 
The public health impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related second primary malignancy is anticipated to be low.

Potential 
mechanisms
Evidence source 
Characterisation 
of the risk
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is clastogenic and calicheamicin is genotoxic and clastogenic.  This is consistent with the known induction of 
DNA breaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics.  Genotoxicity and clastogenicity lead to cellular damage and 
cell death, particularly of rapidly dividing cells.  Hence, reproductive organ toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity observed in nonclinical 
studies following inotuzumab ozogamicin administration likely reflects target-independent DNA damage caused by the cytotoxin 
calicheamicin.

Although the search for reproductive and developmental toxicity (post exposure during pregnancy and while breast feeding) identified all

agent NHL studies,15 no events relevant to adult risks for reproductive and developmental toxicity (post exposure during pregnancy and 
while breast feeding) were identified.

Background Incidence/Prevalence
No published epidemiologic studies are available on the incidence or prevalence of reproductive toxicity among relapsed refractory B-
cell precursor ALL patients in the unexposed target population.
In a long term follow up study of patients treated for newly diagnosed acute leukemia, a retrospective chart review was conducted in 34 
patients with ALL and 67 patients with AML that had survived more than 10 years following treatment.46  The article combined the 
results for AML and ALL unless otherwise specified.  Median follow up was 16 years (range 10 – 28 years).  Twenty-six out of 31(84%) 
women under the age of 40 years resumed normal menstruation following completion of therapy.  Five patients that had not received
total body irradiation prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Following treatment for acute leukemia there were 42 pregnancies 
resulting in 36 live births from 24 women 15 female patients (6 ALL) and nine partners of male patients (ALL 3).  One child that died

soon after birth was anencephalic with several organ abnormalities; another child was born with chromosome 15 abnormality including 
autism (the reference did not specify the results (AML vs. ALL) any further).
Based on findings in animals and the known mechanism of action of inotuzumab ozogamicin, male and female fertility may be 
compromised by treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment can cause foetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman.  The risks to breastfeeding are not known.
Given the known toxicities in animals, appropriate warnings are needed regarding fertility preservation, risks to the foetus, use in 
pregnancy, need for effective contraception, restrictions on when to breastfeed, and recommendation on seeking advice of health care 
professionals if pregnancy occurs during use.
The impact of a reproductive toxicity on an adult patient can include infertility.  If a foetus is exposed to inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
utero, the impact of developmental toxicity could be significant including foetal malformations and foetal death.  There is no information 
regarding the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effect on milk production.
The public health impact of reproductive and developmental toxicities related to inotuzumab ozogamicin is anticipated to be low.

of the risk
Neurotoxicity was observed in nonclinical studies in the absence of binding to the target antigen indicating that the toxicity was target-
independent.  In rats, sensory neuropathy involving both cranial and peripheral nerves was observed and was likely a primary cytotoxic 
effect of calicheamicin on cell bodies in ganglia with subsequent axonal degeneration.  The relevance of these findings to patients is not 
known.

as there is no unexposed target population.  After diagnosis all patients are treated and any untreated patients have a very short survival.
Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity include drugs, advanced age, haemodynamic status, 
and underlying disease.
It is not known if patients may be at an increased risk of developing nephrotoxicity events as a result of exposure to inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.  Thus, there are currently no known preventive measures.
If nephrotoxicity is mild, the impact on an individual patient may be limited.  Severe nephrotoxicity can be a life-threatening event or 
have a fatal outcome.

SVII.3.2. Presentation of the Missing Information
Table 37. Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment
Evidence source:
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Population in need of further characterisation:
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
patients with hepatic impairment defined by NCI ODWG category B1 (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST 
>ULN; n=133) or B2 (total bilirubin > 1.0-1.5 × ULN and AST any level; n=17) was similar to patients 
with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin/AST ≤ ULN; n=611). In 3 patients with hepatic impairment 
defined by NCI ODWG category C (total bilirubin > 1.5-3 × ULN and AST any level) and 1 patient with 
hepatic impairment defined by NCI ODWG category D (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and AST any level), 
inotuzumab ozogamicin clearance did not appear to be reduced.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required when administering inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients with 
mild hepatic impairment.
Table 38. Use in patients with severe renal impairment
Evidence source:
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with renal 
impairment.  Inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease.
Population in need of further characterisation:
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min; n=237), moderate renal impairment (CLcr
30-59 mL/min; n=122), or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min; n=4) was similar to patients with 
normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min; n=402). Inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients 
with end-stage renal disease.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required when administering inotuzumab ozogamicin to patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  
Table 39. Use in Hispanic and Black patients
Evidence source:
Hispanic and Black patients have been underrepresented in clinical studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Population in need of further characterisation:
Hispanic (N=14) and Black (N=22) patients have been underrepresented in clinical studies with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, therefore, it is not known whether the safety profile in those (and other) racial and/or ethnic 
groups is different from that seen in White and Asian patients.  However, the general safety profile of these 
underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups is similar to the overall safety profile for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, although the small number of patients available for analysis makes it difficult to compare 
safety profiles of these individual racial and/or ethnic groups to the overall safety profile for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin.

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Besponsa. The RMP details 
important risks of Besponsa, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Besponsa's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Besponsa's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Besponsa should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Besponsa should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Besponsa's RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Besponsa is authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory 
cluster of differentiation-22 (CD22)-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL). Adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) relapsed or refractory B 
cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains inotuzumab ozogamicin as the active 
substance and it is given by infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Besponsa’s benefits can be found in Besponsa’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/besponsa.
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Besponsa, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Besponsa 's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Page 108
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Besponsa is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Besponsa are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Besponsa. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Inotuzumab ozogamicin clinical and nonclinical studies.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is contraindicated in patients who have experienced 
prior confirmed severe or ongoing VOD/SOS and patients with serious ongoing
hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, active 
hepatitis).
In the following subgroups, the reported frequency of VOD/SOS post-
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was ≥50%: patients who received a 
HSCT conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating agents, patients aged ≥65 
years, and patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ upper limit of normal (ULN) prior 
to HSCT. 
Based on multivariate analysis in Study 1022, patient factors that were 
significantly associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS after a HSCT 
included the use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents 
and serum bilirubin ≥ULN prior to HSCT.
Based on univariate analysis in Study 1022, other patient factors that appeared to 
be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS after a HSCT include a prior 
HSCT, age ≥55 years, a history of hepatic disease and/or hepatitis before 
treatment, later salvage lines, and a greater number of treatment cycles.

pulmonary toxicity [antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, amphotericin B, 
minocycline);  chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, methotrexate, 
cyclophosphamide); antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), and tamoxifen], and 
other treatments or circumstances, including radiation therapy, immune 
suppression resulting in pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal), a 
predisposition to allergic pulmonary disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g., 
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), occupational exposure 
(e.g., smoke, dust, silicone, asbestos), or other factors.

Patients receiving therapy for refractory leukaemia, particularly those receiving 
anti-leukaemic therapy, are susceptible to GI inflammation, including gastritis, 
colitis and/or typhlitis.  Factors that could potentially be associated with an 
increased risk of developing inflammatory GI disease may include a history of 
pre-existing GI abnormalities, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, advanced age, 
chronic illness, and other medications.  Of note, ischemic colitis is more likely 
to occur in older patients, particularly those with comorbidities such as ischemic 
cardiac disease.

Study B1931030
Purpose of the study: This Phase 4 study is a post-marketing requirement (PMR) that was 
requested by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and is designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 inotuzumab ozogamicin dose levels in adults with 
relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL who are eligible for HSCT and who are at higher risk for 
developing VOD post-HSCT. 
Primary objective: To evaluate the rates of VOD and hematologic remission (complete 
remission/complete remission with incomplete haematologic recovery) for 2 inotuzumab 
ozogamicin dose levels in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL who are 
eligible for HSCT and who are at higher risk for developing VOD post-HSCT.
Secondary objective: Safety and efficacy of 2 inotuzumab ozogamicin dose levels.

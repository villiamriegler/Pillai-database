on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Sildenafil ratiopharm continues to be adequately 
and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that 
the benefit risk profile of Sildenafil ratiopharm continues to 
be favourable in the treatment of adult men with erectile 
dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a 
penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual 
performance. In order for Sildenafil ratiopharm to be 
effective, sexual stimulation is required. The CHMP 
recommended the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
with unlimited validity.

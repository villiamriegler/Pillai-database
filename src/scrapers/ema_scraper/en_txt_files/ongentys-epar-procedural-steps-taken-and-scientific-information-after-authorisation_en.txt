Since the date of Marketing Authorization in the EU, no new

efficacy data originated from a phase III study was

and PL 
generated. However, a DB phase II study (ONO-2370-02) 
and an openlabel phase IV study (BIA-OPC-401) were 
concluded during this period. The phase II study 
demonstrated efficacy of OPC in the Japanese population, 
while the phase IV study provided real world data that 
reinforced the efficacy profile evidenced by the DB phase 
III studies.  
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Ongentys in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

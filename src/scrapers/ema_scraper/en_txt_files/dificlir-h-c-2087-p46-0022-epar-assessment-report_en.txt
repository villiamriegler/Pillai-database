1.  Introduction 
On 10 September 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Dificlir, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study OPT-80-206, A Phase 2A, Multicenter, Open-label, Uncontrolled Study 
to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Fidaxomicin Oral Suspension or 
Tablets in Pediatric Subjects With Clostridium difficile–associated Diarrhea, is part of a Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) that has been agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the 
development of fidaxomicin for the treatment of CDAD in the paediatric population (EMA PIP 
Number: EMEA-000636-PIP01-09-M02, EMA Decision Number: P/0063/2014).   
The results of the safety/pharmacokinetics study OPT-80-206 will be used to comply with the 
agreed measures for Study 5 of the PIP. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The existing authorized fidaxomicin 200 mg film-coated tablets are considered as a suitable 
formulation for children from 6 years onwards. 
For study OPT-80-206, a liquid formulation was developed for paediatric subjects up to 6 years or 
subjects unable to swallow the tablets. The liquid formulation in this study was a powder 
formulation to be reconstituted prior to use to obtain an oral suspension. The maximum dosing 
regimen for the oral suspension formulation was the same as for the fidaxomicin tablets, i.e. 200 
mg twice daily. The goal was to provide 200 mg of fidaxomicin in 5 ml of suspension, and have 
enough suspension in one bottle to supply 10 days of dosing (110 ml of suspension).  
A final liquid formulation (granules for oral suspension) is currently under development and will be 
used in the safety/efficacy study in paediatric subjects (2819-CL-0202; Study 6 of agreed PIP). 
Assessor’s comment 
In the present study both tablets and an experimental suspension (in the two lowest age groups) 
has been used. The relative bioavailability between tablet and suspension was not stated by the 
MAH.  
This issue will not be further pursued since formulation development is on-going and a final 
formulation will be used in the safety and efficacy study.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
OPT-80-206, A Phase 2A, Multicenter, Open-label, Uncontrolled Study to Determine the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Fidaxomicin Oral Suspension or Tablets in Pediatric Subjects 
With Clostridium difficile–associated Diarrhea 
Description 
OPT-80-206 is a multi-centre, open-label trial study to investigate the safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of a 10-day course of fidaxomicin oral suspension or tablets given every 12 
hours, in pediatric subjects with CDAD.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of fidaxomicin 
oral suspension or tablets in pediatric subjects, with CDAD, following the administration of doses 
given every 12 hours (q12h) for 10 consecutive days. 
The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical outcome. An assessment of 
clinical response of CDAD at Day 10 was conducted and sustained clinical response was evaluated 
at 28 days post-treatment. 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label uncontrolled study conducted in the United States (10 sites) and 
Canada (1 site). 
Study population /Sample size 
The following inclusion criteria were used: 
1.  Male or female subjects 6 months to < 18 years of age, inclusive. Female subjects of 
childbearing potential must have been using an adequate and reliable method of 
contraception (eg, abstinence, barrier with additional spermicide foam or jelly, intrauterine 
device, hormonal contraception). Subjects (both male and female) must have agreed to 
avoid conception during treatment and for 4 weeks following the end of study treatment. 
2.  Diagnosed with CDAD, which was defined by a positive stool C. difficile toxin A and/or toxin 
B assay result within 48 hours of enrollment and: 
a.  Subjects 6 to 23 months: >3 episodes of watery diarrhea in the 24 hours prior to 
enrollment. 
b.  Subjects 2 years to < 18 years: A change in bowel habits, with >3 unformed bowel 
movements (UBMs) in the 24 hours prior to enrollment. 
3.  Informed consent/assent was provided. 
The following exclusion criteria applied: 
1.  Need for concurrent use of oral vancomycin, metronidazole, or any other effective 
treatments for CDAD during therapy with fidaxomicin. 
2.  Pregnant or breastfeeding an infant.

3.  Fulminant colitis. 
4.  A history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease). 
5.  Need for concurrent use of the following P-glycoprotein inhibitors during therapy with 
fidaxomicin: cyclosporine, itraconazole, and ketoconazole; erythromycin, azithromycin, and 
clarithromycin; verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone, captopril, carvedilol, conivaptan, 
diltiazem, felodipine, lopinavir and ritonavir, quercetin, quinidine, and ranolazine. Topical 
ointments were not excluded, nor were administration of any P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
during the follow up period. 
The sample size was based on clinical and practical considerations, not on formal statistical power 
calculation. Thirty-eight evaluable subjects, stratified by age at enrollment (6–23 months; 2 years- 
< 6 years; 6 years–< 12 years, and 12 years–< 18 years) were enrolled. The goal was to enroll 
equal numbers of subjects in each age stratum. 
Treatments 
The dose of 32 mg/kg/day in divided doses q12h (maximum 400 mg/day) was selected in order to 
achieve local and systemic exposures that were comparable to but did not exceed those observed 
in adults. 
The weight-based dosing was selected by scaling from the vancomycin dose administered to 
children for CDAD; scaling against vancomycin was considered appropriate because neither drug is 
significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
The subject received study medication administered orally with or without food each day for 10 
days (20 doses; q12h regimen). Subjects aged 6 months to < 6 years received weight-based doses 
of fidaxomicin oral suspension 32 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 400 mg/day, divided into 2 
doses taken q12h. 
Subjects aged 6 years to < 18 years received fidaxomicin 200 mg tablets, PO q12h. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Plasma and fecal samples were obtained and analyzed for concentrations of fidaxomicin and its 
main metabolite OP-1118 using validated methods. A PK visit occurred between Days 5 and 10, 
during which 3 blood samples were collected, at 0 to 2 hours before dosing and then 1 to 2 hours 
and 3 to 5 hours after dosing. Fecal collection for PK assessments occurred on Day 10 within 24 
hours after dosing (or at the end of therapy if sooner than Day 10).  
Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable was clinical response rate day 10 or the last day of dosing. 
Positive clinical response (cure) was determined as follows: 
•  Subjects aged 6 to 23 months who no longer had watery diarrhea for 2 consecutive days 
during treatment, who remained well before the time of study medication discontinuation, 
and who did not require further CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study 
medication were considered to have a positive clinical response. 
•  Subjects 2 years to < 18 years who had improvement in the number and character of 
bowel movements as determined by 3 or fewer UBMs for 2 consecutive days during 
treatment, who remained well before the time of study medication discontinuation, and 
who did not require further CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study 
medication were considered to have a positive clinical response.

Assessment of clinical response: symptoms of CDAD were fever >38°C (100.4°F), white blood 
cell (WBC) count >13,000/mm3, abdominal discomfortt, and abdominal tenderness.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables included: 
Recurrence rate and time to recurrence 
Sustained clinical response (assessed 28 days post-treatment) 
Safety variables 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics were presented for all summarized data. 
The safety population included all subjects with any evaluable safety data who had received at 
least one dose of fidaxomicin. This population was the primary analysis set used in all safety 
summaries. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all subjects with CDAD confirmed by a 
positive toxin assay within 24 hours before enrollment who received at least one dose of study 
medication. 
The per-protocol (PP) population consisted of subjects in the mITT population who met the 
following criteria: 
•  Met all of the inclusion criteria and met none of the exclusion criteria (unless deviations to 
either of these were documented and approved by the sponsor). 
•  Were exposed to a sufficient course of therapy: subjects required at least 3 complete days 
(6 active doses of fidaxomicin) to be considered treatment failures and 8 complete days 
(16 active doses of fidaxomicin) to be considered as having a positive clinical response. 
•  Had an end-of-therapy clinical evaluation. 
•  Did not have significant protocol violations, including use of concomitant CDAD therapy or 
other drugs that could have confounded the assessment of efficacy. 
Analyses of clinical outcome (except for recurrence) were performed using the mITT and PP 
populations. 
The sample size was based on clinical and practical considerations and not formal statistical power 
calculation.

Assessor’s comment 
All patients were positive at baseline for one or both C. difficile toxins A and B. 
Medical history 
At baseline > 10 % of the subjects reported a number of health conditions. In addition to 
gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
nausea, and vomiting) and gastrointestinal-related infections and infestations (clostridial infection 
and C. difficile colitis), conditions reported by >10% of subjects overall included anemia, 
gastrostomy tube insertion, pyrexia, otitis media, thrombocytopenia, failure to thrive, dehydration, 
esophagogastric fundoplasty, cerebral palsy, hypertension, sepsis, sinusitis, and tachycardia. 
Overall, 23.7% of subjects had a history of neoplasms (benign, malignant, and unspecified).

Prior and concomitant medications 
Before the study baseliene, 36.8% of subjects had taken metronidazole and 23.7% had received 
oral vancomycin as an antidiarrheal/anti-inflammatory. Prior use of antidiarrheal and intestinal 
anti-inflammatory drugs was reported by 39.5% of subjects. Prior use of systemic antibiotics (not 
including those effective in the treatment of CDAD) was reported by 26.3% of subjects, including 
cephalosporins (13.2%), clindamycin (5.3%), and fluoroquinolones (2.6%), which have historically 
been considered to put adults at high risk for CDAD. 
Previous treatment with antineoplastic agents ranged from 8.3% to 25.0% among the age groups 
and was reported for 13.2% of subjects overall. 
There were 18.4% of subjects receiving systemic antibiotics concomitantly with study medication, 
ranging from 11.1% to 25.0% across age groups. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most frequently 
used concomitant antibiotic (13.2% of subjects). Metronidazole and vancomycin were each used 
concomitantly by 5.3% of subjects. During the follow-up period, 26.3% of subjects received 
systemic antibiotics (not including those effective in the treatment of CDAD). 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The plasma and faecal concentration levels of fidaxomicin and its metabolite, OP-1118, are shown 
in tables below. 
The mean plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin across the age groups ranged from 8.9 to 16.6 
ng/mL at 1 to 2 hours after dosing and 9.8 ng/mL to 15.6 ng/mL at 3 to 5 hours after dosing. For 
the metabolite OP-1118 mean plasma levels ranged from 27.5 to 130 ng/mL at 1 to 2 hours after 
dosing, and 28.5 to 122 ng/mL at 3 to 5 hours after dosing. One subject in the youngest age group 
showed much higher plasma OP-1118 levels than the other subjects, Fidaxomicin concentration 
was also high in this subject and was possibly due to a poor gastrointestinal integrity in this 
individual.   
Table 3. Summary of Observed Plasma Levels of Fidaxomicin (OPT-080) and Its 
Metabolite (OP-1118) 
The overall mean of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in fecal samples were 3228 and 865 μg/g, 
respectively. The MAH points out that there was a trend toward higher mean concentrations in the 
youngest age group and a point to consider in evaluating the variability in the youngest stratum is 
that these samples would typically be collected from diapers, which may dehydrate the sample and 
contribute a positive bias to the concentration measured.

Table 4. Summary of Observed Fecal Levels of Fidaxomicin (OPT-080) and Its Metabolite 
(OP-1118) at End-of-Therapy Visit 
Assessor’s comment 
The selection of post-dose time-points for plasma PK of parent and metabolite and the grouping of 
time interval 1-2 h and 3-5 h are somewhat unclear. According to the MAH the time-points were 
selected based on the expected time of maximal concentration in adults, which is typically between 
1 and 5 hours post-dosing in adults for both the parent drug and OP-1118. However the plasma 
concentration time profile has been shown in adults to be relatively flat, particularly at the 3-5 h 
time-interval, which is used to compare with adult exposure.   
Although no formal statistical analysis was performed for the paediatic plasma PK data no clear 
correlation of obtained exposure to age could be detected.  
Efficacy results 
Clinical response rate 
Table 5. Summary of Clinical Response Rates at End of Therapy 
Assessor’s comment 
Clinical response evaluated day 10 or the last day of dosing was 92 % for the mITT population.  
Recurrence rate and time to recurrence 
There were 28.6% of subjects in the mITT population (n = 35) and 30.3% of subjects in the PP 
population (n = 33) had recurrence of CDAD during the follow-up period. The proportions of 
subjects experiencing recurrence were generally similar across age groups. 
The 20th percentile for time to recurrence ranged from 7 to 27 days and was 22 days overall. 
Sustained clinical response 
Overall, 65.8% of subjects in the mITT population and 66.7% of subjects in the PP population had 
a sustained response (response at end of treatment and through day 28 post-treatment). 
Assessor’s comment 
Approximately 29-30 % of the patients had a recurrence of CDAD during the follow-up period.

The majority of TEAEs were mild (44.7% of subjects, 76/102 events) or moderate (21.1% of 
subjects, 20/102 events) in severity. Three subjects (7.9%) experienced evere TEAEs: 1 subject 
each in the 6 to 23 months, 2 years to <6 years, and the 12 years to <18 years age groups. 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 9 subjects (23.7%) experienced at least 1 SAE (overall 13 SAEs). Greater proportions of 
subjects in the younger age groups had SAEs. Ten events resolved with sequelae, 2 were resolving 
and resulted in death. SAEs reported from more than one subject were C. difficile colitis and 
vomiting. The subject who died was in the 6 to 23 months age group, suffered from infant acute 
lymphocytic leukemia and was undergoing chemotherapy. The patient developed bacteremia, 
septic shock and respiratory failure. None of the SAEs were considered related to the study drug. 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs 
Three subjects (7.9%) were discontinued from study medication or withdrawn from the study due 
to TEAEs (urticaria, flatulence, increased body temperature and tachycardia). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The bioavailability for the tablets was not determined in the initial MAA for the product. From 
animals studies the bioavailability has been estimated to be in the range 0.2-3%, which is 
consistent with a locally acting agent.  
In phase III studies of fidaxomicin in adults with CDAD, plasma levels 3 to 5 hours after a 200-mg 
dose (given twice daily) averaged 28.5 ±26.7 ng/mL on Day 10 of dosing, and OP-1118 averaged 
85.6 ± 131 ng/mL. The plasma levels seen in children are comparably low, with an average 
fidaxomicin concentration across all strata of 13.4 ±15.5 ng/mL at 3 to 5 hours post-dose and OP-
1118 of 60 ±152.2 ng/mL. Although no formal statistical analysis was performed for the paediatic 
PK data no clear correlation of obtained exposure to age could be detected.  
Feaces samples collected within 24 hours of the last dose had a mean concentration of 3228 μg/g 
(range 268 to 11,500) and 865 μg/g (range 76 to 2540) for fidaxomicin and OP-1118, respectively. 
In phase III studies of fidaxomicin in adults with CDAD (global cure) the corresponding figures was 
>1000 μg/g and >800 μg/g for fidaxomicin and OP-1118, respectively.

After a 10-day treatment period, the clinical response was 92 % and approximately one third of the 
patients had a relapse during the follow-up period. 
The safety profile seems to be similar to that seen in adult patients with CDAD. 
However, no firm conclusion can be drawn from the limited data of this open-labeled study, 
although data support further development of fidaxomicin in children in accordance with the PIP. 
The MAH is of the opinion that further data is required to confirm the safety and efficacy in the 
pediatric population. The results of this study do not alter the benefit/risk of Dificlir in adults. 
Further, the MAH believe that the data is not sufficient to support changes in the product 
information. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH’s conclusions are supported. 
Although no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding PK, efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin in 
children based on the limited data from this open-labelled study, data support the further 
development in accordance with the PIP.

On 22 October 2015 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Volibris. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Glaxo Group Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
‘Volibris is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of 
WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, including use in combination treatment to improve exercise  
capacity (see section 5.1). Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with 
connective tissue disease.’ 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
On 19 January 2011 the MAH submitted the final study report of study 028 for Rotateq in accordance 
with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric 
use. 
A clinical study report plus a short critical expert overview were provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit-risk relationship for 
RotaTeq and there is no consequential regulatory action. 
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a CSR for study 028, which was conducted in China from September 2009 to 
March 2010 to support the licensing of the vaccine in that country. 
Clinical study 
The primary purpose of Protocol 028 was to evaluate the safety of the oral 3-dose regimen of RotaTeq 
(V260) in a healthy Chinese population, especially with respect to serious adverse experiences (SAEs) 
occurred within 14 days following vaccination.  
Methods 
This randomized, double-blinded (operated under in-house blinding procedures), placebo-controlled 
study was conducted at one study center; no formal hypotheses were included in the study. In 
accordance with SFDA and Chinese Vaccine Clinical Trial Guidelines, all infant vaccines are to be 
evaluated for safety sequentially in adults first, followed by children, and finally infants. The minimum 
sample size was designated as 20 vaccine-exposed subjects for each age cohort.  Specifically, the 3 
cohorts included in this study were as follows: 
•  Cohort I - single dose of V260 or placebo (2.0mL/dose) administered to Chinese adults ages 
19-47 years; 
•  Cohort II - single dose of V260 or placebo (2.0mL/dose) administered to Chinese children ages 
2-6 years; 
•  Cohort III - 3 doses of V260 or placebo (2.0mL/dose) in Chinese infants ages 6-12 weeks at 
the time of receipt of the first dose. 
The sample size for each cohort was 48 subjects (1:1 randomization to vaccine or placebo) to ensure a 
minimum of 20 evaluable subjects exposed to V260 per cohort. 
All subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine were evaluated for all adverse experiences 
(AEs) during the 14-day safety follow-up period after each dose.  In addition, all subjects were 
followed for any vaccine-related SAEs, deaths, and Event of Clinical Interest (ECI of intussusception) 
until the end of the study.  Safety information was collected following each vaccination, using a 
Vaccination Report Card (VRC) starting with the date of vaccination.  After each dose, the subjects in 
Cohort I and the parents/legal guardians for Cohorts II and III recorded axillary temperatures and 
episodes of vomiting and diarrhea daily for 7 days on the VRC.  All other adverse experiences (AEs)

occurring during the 14 days following each vaccination were reported, as well as concomitant 
medications and any other vaccinations. 
The safety analysis was based on the number of subjects and proportion of subjects with various types 
of non-serious AEs (NSAEs) and SAEs by treatment group.  Within each cohort, the proportions of 
subjects reporting AEs were compared between the vaccine and placebo groups using risk differences, 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and corresponding p-values using the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method according to a 3-tier approach. 
• 
• 
• 
Tier I AEs were pre-specified in the protocol as events of interest: elevated temperature 
(≥37.1°C, axillary), vomiting, diarrhea, and intussusception.  CIs and p-values were computed 
for these events. 
Tier II AEs were any non-Tier I events where the count of subjects in either treatment group 
was at least 4, and CIs were computed for these events. 
Tier III AEs were any non-Tier I or II events, and only proportions of subjects reporting these 
events were summarized by treatment.  For Cohort III, the tiers were based on AEs across all 
3 doses. 
Results 
A total of 144 subjects, 48 in each cohort were enrolled in this study and received at least 1 dose of 
study vaccine.  All subjects in Cohorts I & II completed the study, with no subjects having discontinued 
or were considered lost to follow-up.  In Cohort III, 6 subjects discontinued the study due to 
withdrawal of consent, family relocation, and one SAE of diarrhoea (in the placebo group).  The mean 
age was 37 years in Cohort I, 4 years in cohort II, and 9 weeks in cohort III. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
No subjects in Cohort I and Cohort II reported any SAE throughout the entire study. 
In Cohort III, no subjects in the vaccine group experienced any SAE throughout the entire study. There 
were 3 subjects (12.5%, 3/24) in the placebo group with a total of 4 SAEs reported, with 3 of these 4 
SAEs being considered not vaccine-related by the investigator (bronchopneumonia, viral encephalitis) 
and 1 SAE of diarrhoea to be vaccine-related. 
Non-Serious Adverse Events (NSAEs) 
In Cohort I, the proportion of subjects who reported 1 or more clinical NSAEs was higher in the group 
that received V260 (25.0%, 6/24) than in the group that received placebo (8.3%, 2/24).  The most 
commonly reported NSAEs (incidence ≥5%) in Cohort I were malaise (8.3% in vaccine group, 0% in 
placebo group) and headache (8.3% in vaccine group, 4.2% in placebo group).  The proportions of 
subjects in Cohort I with NSAEs within 14 days of study vaccination that were considered to be 
vaccine-related by the investigator were comparable in both treatment groups (vaccine 4.2% vs. 
placebo 4.2%).  The NSAEs were all mild or moderate in intensity and were all resolved by the end of 
the study. 
In Cohort II, the proportion of subjects who reported 1 or more clinical NSAEs was higher in the V260 
group (25.0%, 6/24) than in the placebo group (12.5%, 3/24).  The most commonly reported NSAE 
(incidence ≥5%) in Cohort II was pyrexia (as judged and reported by the clinician), 16.7% vs. 8.3% in 
the V260 and placebo group, respectively.  The proportion of subjects with vaccine-related NSAEs was

also higher in the V260 group (20.8%, 5/24) than in the placebo group (8.3%, 2/24).  The NSAEs 
were all mild or moderate in intensity and were all resolved by the end of the study.  
In Cohort III, 73.9% (17/23) of subjects in the V260 group and 58.3% (14/24) of subjects in the 
placebo group reported at least 1 NSAE.  The most commonly reported NSAEs were diarrhoea (52.2% 
in vaccine group, 33.3% in placebo group), vomiting (39.1% in vaccine group, 50.0% in placebo 
group), and pyrexia (39.1% in vaccine group, 20.8% in placebo group).  Vaccine-related NSAEs were 
reported in 65.2% (15/23) of V260 recipients and 58.3% (14/24) of placebo recipients.  The NSAEs 
were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and were resolved or resolving by the end of the study.  The 
1 NSAE with severe intensity (pyrexia) occurred in the placebo group.

c = Count of the non-serious adverse events 
For each system organ class and each preferred term, each subject was counted only once 
One subject (AN 05243) in the V260 group of Cohort III received V260 at the first and third dose but 
† 
placebo at the second dose in error. The subject had moderate or mild diarrhea after the second and third 
doses, respectively. The data from this subject was excluded from the table. 
One subject (AN 05247) had elevated temperatures associated with an upper respiratory tract infection 
‡ 
(URI). The investigator did not report the elevated temperature as “pyrexia” since it was one of the signs and 
symptoms of the URI. 
Tier I AEs and Events of clinical Interest (Intussusception) 
During the course of this relatively small study, there was no report of intussusception (ECI) in any 
cohort, including among the 48 infant subjects enrolled. 
The incidence of Tier I AEs was low; the difference was not statistically significant between the 2 
treatment groups in Cohort I and Cohort II. 
In Cohort III, the proportion of subjects who reported an elevated temperature (documented as 
≥37.1°C axillary) was higher in the group that received V260 (43.5%, 10/23) than in the group that 
received placebo (16.7%, 4/24).  The risk difference (26.81%, 95% CI: 0.38, 50.43) between these 2 
groups was statistically significant (p-value: 0.023).  However, the cases of elevated temperature were 
mostly mild or moderate in intensity and resolved during the study.  The comparison between the 2 
treatment groups showed that the differences in the incidences of vomiting (9/23 [39.1%] vaccine vs. 
12/24 [50.0%] placebo) and diarrhoea (12/23 [52.2%] vaccine vs. 8/24 [33.3%] placebo) were not 
statistically significant between the 2 treatment groups.  The risk differences were -10.87 (95% CI: -
37.51, 17.47) and 18.84 (95% CI: -9.62, 44.56) for vomiting and diarrhoea, respectively. 
Tier II Adverse Events: 
No case of Tier II adverse events was reported in any cohort in the study. 
Tier III Adverse Events 
These AEs were cough, respiratory tract infections, viral encephalitis, pyrexia, constipation, diarrhoea, 
and glossodynia.

A system organ class or an adverse event of special interest is presented only when the incidence rate is greater than or 
equal to the percentage shown in the report title in one or more groups. 
Each subject was counted only once for each Tier I adverse event.  
*  Significant Statistical Difference (p<0.05) 
†  One subject (AN 05243) in the V260 group of Cohort III received V260 at the first and third dose but placebo at the 
second dose in error. The subject had moderate or mild diarrhea after the second and third doses, respectively. This 
subject did not report any SAE. The data from this subject was excluded from the table. 
Faecal shedding of vaccine virus 
Faecal vaccine virus shedding between Day 3 and Day 7 following any vaccination was studied in 
Cohort III (the targeted population).  Faecal shedding of vaccine rotavirus (confirmed by the VP6 PCR 
assay) was seen in 3/23 (13.0%) postdose 1, 2/21 (9.5%) postdose 2, and 3/22 (13.6%) postdose 3.  
These results are consistent with those observed in the previous Phase III V260 study, Protocol 006, in 
which faecal shedding of vaccine-strain virus was observed in approximately 9% of the subjects 
primarily after dose 1. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The safety profile of Rotateq in this small group of Chinese subjects is consistent with that shown in 
earlier large Phase III trials conducted primarily in the USA and Europe.  There was no excess 
incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea among vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients.  Only 
the rate of pyrexia was significantly higher in subjects who received V260 compared to subjects who 
received placebo.  There was no report of intussusception in any cohort. 
Therefore, it can be agreed that these data have no implications for the EU SmPC.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
According to the WHO, the prevalence of obesity in Europe is increasing and contributes towards (up to) 
80% of new diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a correlation between obesity and insulin 
resistance. Insulin requirements in people with diabetes mellitus and who are obese are higher than the 
non-obese. Standard insulin injection devices only allow administration of a maximum of 80 units per 
injection and administration of large volumes (>1 mL) may be associated with pain or discomfort. 
One way to manage people with high daily insulin requirements is the development of insulin products 
with higher strengths than the current 100 U/ml.  
Liprolog (insulin lispro, rDNA origin) is a human insulin analogue that is a rapid-acting, parenteral blood 
glucose-lowering agent. Chemically, it is Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analogue, created when the 
amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B-chain are reversed. Liprolog is synthesised in a 
non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the 
addition of the gene for insulin lispro. The general safety and efficacy of insulin lispro 100 U/mL solution 
for injection has been established since its first marketing authorisation in the EU on 30 April 1996. 
The clinical development program for Liprolog 200 U/ml solution for injection was based on the 
demonstration of bioequivalence to the 100 U/mL formulation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This line extension application is for a 200 Units/mL Insulin Lispro, which is double the strength of the 
currently available Liprolog products. The 200 U/ml will be presented only in the form of the prefilled 
KwikPen device. The proposed modified KwikPen will contain a total of 600 units of insulin lispro in a 
prefilled pen injector within a standard 3mL cartridge.  
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 5/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The finished product is a solution, administered as a subcutaneous injection. The formulation differs from 
the formulation for the 100U strength. It is a solution for injection in a buffer also containing glycerol as 
a tonicity-modifying agent and metacresol as an anti-microbial preservative.  
The KwikPen proposed for the new strength is based on the existing Lilly mechanical, prefilled pen injector 
device used for the current 100 U/mL Liprolog. The immediate container is a standard 3 ml glass cartridge 
of identical dimensions and composition as that used for the existing products. To accommodate the 200 
U/mL strength with the same cartridge and device dimensions, the pen device mechanism has been 
modified to allow variable dosing in 0.005 ml/unit increments (compared to 0.010 ml/unit increments in 
the 100 U/ml KwikPen).  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance in Liprolog is insulin lispro, a Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analogue, created 
when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B-chain are reversed. Liprolog is synthesised 
in a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the 
addition of the gene for insulin lispro.  
No changes have been introduced to the active substance in this line extension application. Lilly refers to 
the currently approved Liprolog dossier for all quality information related to the active substance, insulin 
lispro.  
It is however noted that procedure EMEA/H/C/000088/WS0353/0113/G with the scope to register a 
Design Space for the introduction of a post approval change management protocol related to the active 
substance involving a major change to the manufacturing process for insulin lispro has recently been 
approved. In the response to the CHMP D120 LOQ Lilly has provided appropriate clarification on how the 
200 U/ml strength will be incorporated into the change management protocol in question. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is a 200 U/ml solution for injection and presented as a 3ml cartridge in a sealed 
single use prefilled pen device which is a modification of the KwikPen currently used for the 100 U/mL 
range of Lilly insulin and insulin analogue products. It is manufactured and assembled at established 
insulin analogue manufacturing sites using similar manufacturing methods.  
The container closure system is based on that used for the current U-100 product and evaluation of its 
suitability was carried out and has been found acceptable. 
The chosen composition of metacresol as an antimicrobial preservative is the same as that employed for 
the U-100 Liprolog products. The applicant has conducted studies following standard methods to confirm 
that Insulin with the range of the metacresolcontent can comply with compendial microbial growth 
inhibition requirements. 
The insulin lispro drug product is contained with a sealed cartridge assembled into a specified pen device. 
Once assembled, the resulting pen-injector is a sealed unit that cannot be disassembled without 
physically destroying the pen-injector. Hence it can be assumed that the cartridge may not be readily 
removed intact limiting the possibility of it being transferred to another device. The design of U-200 
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 6/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
product has been found to be an appropriate approach from a safety point of view since the pen injector 
device is specifically designed only for use with the U-200 product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is based on, and similar to, the one employed for the current U-100 product. 
Formulation studies were carried out which investigated the robustness of the formulation under 
processing. Optimisation of the formulation and the manufacturing process was implemented between 
the clinical and commercial lots. Three 120L lots of final commercial product were then evaluated. The 
established procedures for preparation of the solution and for sterilisation were found to be suitable for 
the U-200 product.  
Satisfactory details have been provided of the manufacturing process which follows procedures already 
established for the approved U-100 product. Appropriate validation data has been provided for three 
commercial scale lots.  
The in process control procedures are considered appropriate for the process and include mixing, 
dissolution and filling as well as validation of sterile filtration. Aseptic processing and sanitization 
procedures are satisfactory. 
Product specification 
The specifications for Insulin lispro 200 U/mL are based on experience with the established Liprolog 100 
U/mL product including stability testing data. 
Satisfactory details of the release testing of the cartridges and the assembled pens have been provided. 
They are consistent with those applied to the established U-100 strength which is appropriate.  
Stability of the product 
The submission contains stability data generated from three 120L lots of 200 U/mL finished product and 
packaged in the final commercial immediate container which contains a grey coloured plunger. An 
ongoing stability study is designed to monitor stability under long term storage conditions of for 36 
months, under accelerated conditions of 30°C for 3 months and simulated in-use patient conditions.  
The stability data provided in the initial submission was insufficient to fully support the requested 
shelf-life of the product. The Applicant was requested to propose an appropriate shelf life based on real 
time data. Any bracketing should be adequately justified. This should include, if relevant, data and 
justification of any extrapolation and commitments to support the stability. 
With the responses to the List of questions, Lilly has provided updated real time data in the final container. 
Additional accelerated data has been provided. Some additional batches have been tested under normal 
storage conditions up to 36 months.  The data provided meets the predefined specification and does not 
indicate any trends which would raise concern. It was concluded that the proposed shelf life of 36 months 
can be accepted provided that a written commitment regarding ongoing studies is received. The 
requested commitment has been received. 
Adventitious agents 
All excipients used comply with the relevant PhEur requirements. No excipients of animal origin are used.

Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The company has provided satisfactory responses to the outstanding quality points and the application is 
considered approvable. The applicant has submitted a written commitment regarding ongoing stability 
studies as requested. 
2.2.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended an additional point for investigation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has developed a concentrated version (200 U/ml insulin lispro) of Liprolog (currently available as 
100 U/ml insulin lispro). 
The insulin lispro 200 U/ml clinical trial formulation was based on the commercial Liprolog 100 U/ml 
formulation (insulin lispro 100 U/ml). Changes to the formulation of the established product are: 
 
 
increasing the lispro concentration from 100 U/ml to 200 U/ml 
changing the buffering agent from dibasic sodium phosphate to trometamol (hydroxymethyl 
aminomethane) (TRIS) 
 
increasing the zinc concentration. 
One bioequivalence study (study IOPY) has been submitted in support of the current application. The 
study was done to establish bioequivalence between two formulations of insulin lispro: insulin lispro 
phosphate U-100 and insulin lispro TRIS U-200. 
The impact of zinc ion concentration changes was previously examined in Study IMAB, submitted as part 
of the original MAA for Liprolog. Study IMAB evaluated the pharmcokinetics and ‘glucodynamics’ of an 
insulin lispro formulation with a zinc concentration compared to an insulin lispro formulation without zinc: 
study IMAB concluded that the impact of zinc was not clinically relevant. The proposed commercial 
formulation increase in zinc ion concentration in the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation is within the range 
examined in Study IMAB; therefore, it is also not considered clinically relevant. 
The company has submitted the following clinical studies in support of this application.

2.3.2.1. 
Main clinical study 
One bioequivalence study (study IOPY) has been submitted in support of the current application. The 
study was done to establish bioequivalence between two formulations of insulin lispro: insulin lispro 
phosphate U-100 and insulin lispro TRIS U-200. 
Title of Study: Evaluation of the Bioequivalence of Two Formulations of Insulin Lispro in Healthy Subjects 
Study code: F3Z-EW-IOPY 
Study Design: Phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 8-hour 
euglycaemic clamp study. 
Methods 
• 
Study participants  
Eligibility of subjects for study entry was based on the results of a screening medical history, physical 
examination, clinical laboratory tests and an ECG. 
Inclusion criteria 
  Healthy subjects, aged 21 – 50yr with a body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive. 
Exclusion criteria 
  Affiliated to the MAH 
  Allergies to insulin or excipients 
  1st degree relative with diabetes mellitus 
 
a fasting venous blood glucose >6 mmol/L at screening. 
• 
Treatments 
The study is a phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 8-hour 
euglycemic clamp study to compare the pharmcokinetics and ‘glucodynamics’ of insulin lispro TRIS U-200 
versus insulin lispro phosphate U-100 after s/c administration of 20 U. The treatments were replicated 
such that each formulation was administered twice on different occasions to healthy subjects over 4 study 
periods.  
Subjects fasted for about 8 hours prior to each dose.  
Blood samples were collected over the entire clamp procedure to determine free serum immunoreactive 
insulin lispro-specific concentrations for PK evaluations.  
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 9/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
There was an interval of approximately 4 to 7 days between doses. 
• 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
 
To demonstrate the bioequivalence of pharmacokinetic variables (AUC0-tlast and Cmax) for the 
insulin lispro TRIS U-200 formulation relative to that of insulin lispro phosphate U-100 after 
subcutaneous administration of 20 units to healthy subjects. 
Secondary objectives 
 
To compare other pharmacokinetic variables for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 versus insulin lispro 
phosphate U-100 after s/c administration. 
 
To compare the ‘glucodynamic’ responses for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 versus insulin lispro 
phosphate U-100 formulation after s/c administration. 
 
To assess safety and tolerability of insulin lispro TRIS U-200 and insulin lispro phosphate U-100 in 
healthy subjects. 
• 
Sample size 
Thirty completers in a replicated treatment design will provide at least 90% power to show the 90% 
confidence interval of the ratio of means for AUC0-tlast between the 2 formulations to be within the 0.80 to 
1.25 limits.  
• 
Randomisation 
A randomisation schedule and dosing details for patients was submitted. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. An open-label study design was considered appropriate for a study with 
pharmacokinetics as the primary endpoint. 
• 
Statistical methods 
To evaluate bioequivalence between insulin lispro TRIS U-200 relative to insulin lispro phosphate U-100, 
log-transformed area under concentration parameter estimates (AUC0-tlast, AUC0-8) were analysed using 
a linear mixed-effects model where formulation (TRIS or phosphate), period and sequence were included 
as fixed factors, and subject as a random factor. 
If the 90% CI for treatment ratios (test/reference) for both AUC0-tlast and Cmax are contained within the 
range 0.80-1.25, the formulations were considered bioequivalent. A nonparametric approach was taken 
to evaluate tmax, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The difference in median tmax between formulations 
and the 95% CIs for the difference was presented. 
To address the secondary objective of comparing glucodynamic variables (Gtot and Rmax) between the 
U-200 lispro TRIS formulation (test treatment) and the U-100 lispro phosphate formulation (reference 
treatment), log-transformed Gtot and Rmax estimates were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model 
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 10/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
where formulation (TRIS or phosphate), period, and sequence were included as fixed factors, and a 
random effect for subject. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
45 healthy men and women were to be enrolled in order that a target of 30 subjects completed the study. 
Of the 41 subjects who entered the study, 38 were randomly assigned to treatment. 
38 healthy subjects, 36 male and 2 female, between the ages of 23 and 45 (with a mean [SD] age of 32.4 
[7.1] years) participated in this study and received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
36 completed the study and 5 did not complete the study. 
4 subjects discontinued due to subject decision: 3 subjects considered the cannulation difficult and / or 
painful and 1 subject could not commit to the study schedule. 
1 subject discontinued due to a protocol violation: the subject’s body mass index decreased below the 
inclusion criteria of 18.5kg/m2 during 2 dosing periods.

The following table summarises the pharmacokinetic variables: 
As shown in the following table, the ratio means for AUC(0-8), AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-∞) and Cmax values 
were between 0.933 to 0.994. Furthermore, since all of the 90% CIs for the ratios were contained within 
0.80-1.25 then the bioequivalence of insulin lispro TRIS U-200 to insulin lispro phosphate U-100 
formulation was demonstrated. 
The CHMP acknowledged that the 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC are within the 80 – 125 
limits and so are consistent with bioequivalence between the two formulations. 
Estimates of between- and within-subject variability by formulation are presented in the following table: 
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014

Supportive studies 
The company referred in this application to study IMAB, submitted as part of the original MAA for Liprolog. 
Study IMAB evaluated the pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics of an insulin lispro formulation with zinc 
compared to an insulin lispro formulation without zinc. The company has concluded that zinc content, as 
described in IMAB, did not affect the release kinetics of insulin lispro into the general circulation. 
In addition, a validation study of a method for the determination of free Lispro Insulin in human serum by 
radio-immunoassay was submitted by the MAH.  
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Study IOPY was a phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 
8-hour euglycemic clamp study carried out to establish bioequivalence between insulin lispro TRIS U-200 
and insulin lispro phosphate U-100. 38 subjects received one or more doses of study drug and 36 subjects 
completed the study. 
The CHMP was of the view that the design and conduct of study IOPY are acceptable.

Statistical analysis of Cmax and AUC for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 and insulin lispro phosphate U-100 
returned results within the 80 – 125 confidence interval limits. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study IOPY, insulin lispro TRIS U-200 may be considered 
bioequivalent with insulin lispro phosphate U-100. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
38 subjects received one or more doses of study drug in the submitted clinical trials. 
Adverse events 
None of the 38 subjects who received one or more doses of study drug reported adverse events that were 
related to study drug as judged by the investigator. The most common adverse events were catheter site 
haematoma (11 subjects) and procedural-site reaction (5 subjects). Most adverse events were of mild 
severity, 2 events were considered moderate (1 catheter site haematoma in each treatment group) and 
none was considered severe. Records of fluctuations in vital signs were not considered to be clinically 
significant. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths and serious adverse events did not occur. 
Laboratory findings 
There were not any clinically-significant alterations in laboratory or urinalysis results. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation because of an adverse event did not occur. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH recognised that medication errors (between both doses) are the main potential risk. However, 
the MAH considered that these errors are limited to a misuse of the product. The MAH identified two 
possible scenarios that could lead to medication errors: (i) extraction of the 200 U/mL solution from a 
dedicated pen and administration by a different delivery system and (ii) carrying out an unnecessary dose 
conversion when changing from 100 U/mL to 200 U/mL or vice versa. These have been adequately 
addressed by labelling of the new strength and a communication plan (Dear Healthcare Professional 
Communication and Patient Communication) has been developed as described in the Risk Management 
Plan.

2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
During the course of the study, there were not any adverse events that were considered to be related to 
study drug and there were not any clinically-significant alterations in vital signs or laboratory results. 
Within the study, both formulations of insulin lispro appeared to be well-tolerated and safe.

Category 2 are specific obligations 
Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures) 
In addition to the studies listed in this Pharmacovigilance plan, the Applicant has committed to submitting 
a protocol synopsis within one month after Commission Decision of the U200 strength, and to submit a full 
protocol within 6 months after Commission Decision, for a study examining the effectiveness of risk 
minimization. The study objectives are to assess the receipt, perception and comprehension of key 
messages relating to all potential medication errors, as well as impact on behaviour. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan, together with the 
study the Applicant has committed to regarding measuring the effectiveness of risk minimisation 
measures, are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional expert consultation 
During the evaluation procedure for Liprolog 200 U/ml concerns were raised with regards to the 
introduction of the new strength, and whether sufficient measures had been put in place to ensure the 
safe and correct use of the new high strength concentration. As such a Healthcare Professional and 
Patient Organisation consultation was launched to request feedback on how to minimise the risk of 
medication errors with this new strength for Liprolog. The comments received in this consultation 
prompted the PRAC and CHMP to request further changes to the labelling (mainly to clearly differentiate 
both strengths). The MAH adequately addressed these concerns by amending the labelling and by other 
measurements described in the risk minimisation plan. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Insulin lispro 100 U/mL is a well-understood, extensively-studied product with an established positive 
benefit-risk ratio that has been marketed in the EU since 1996. The company has developed a 200 U/mL 
formulation. The company intends the current product to be used by those people with diabetes mellitus 
who need >20U insulin at mealtime. 
The MAH has submitted study IOPY to claim bioequivalence between the 100 U/mL formulation of insulin 
lispro and the new 200 U/mL formulation. The company anticipates that because the insulin lispro 200 
U/ml formulation is bioequivalent to the currently marketed insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation then the 
therapeutic benefit-risk ratio (incorporating the known beneficial effects) of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml 
formulation may also be claimed for the 200 U/mL product. 
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 26/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
A dedicated device has been developed to administer the new formulation. The company has carried out 
human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device following scientific 
advice from the FDA and by following published guidance from the FDA. 
Testing was carried out on subjects with diabetes mellitus, physicians and nurses (each group given its 
own set of scenarios).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Study IOPY was a study of bioequivalence carried out on healthy volunteers, none of whom was clinically 
obese. Insulin lispro 200 U/mL has not (apparently) been studied in people with diabetes mellitus, obese 
or not. The human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device was carried 
out in an office environment and involved simulation of injections. There is not, at present, any clinical 
knowledge of beneficial effects in the population of people with diabetes mellitus either arising from 
exposure to insulin lispro 200 U/mL or from using the newly developed administration device. 
The company claims of potential benefit are based on the company’s own expertise, consultations with 
advisory boards, market research and published literature. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The company anticipates that because the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation is bioequivalent to the 
currently marketed insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation then the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio 
(incorporating the known unfavourable effects) of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation may also be 
claimed for the 200 U/mL product. 
The company recognises that medication errors are the main potential risk and considers that these are 
limited to a misuse of the product. The company has identified two possible scenarios: (i) extraction of the 
200 U/mL solution from a dedicated pen and administration by a different delivery system and (ii) 
carrying out an unnecessary dose conversion when changing from 100 U/mL to 200 U/mL or vice versa. 
These have been addressed by labelling and other measurements described in the risk minimisation plan. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Study IOPY was a study of bioequivalence carried out on healthy volunteers, none of whom was clinically 
obese. Insulin lispro 200 U/mL has not (apparently) been studied in people with diabetes mellitus, obese 
or not. There is not, at present, any clinical knowledge of unfavourable effects in the population of people 
with diabetes mellitus either arising from exposure to insulin lispro 200 U/mL or from using the newly 
developed administration device. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
On the basis of bioequivalence between insulin lispro 100 U/mL and insulin lispro 200 U/mL, it is 
acknowledged that it is reasonable to assume that the importance of the favourable and unfavourable 
effects of exposure to the 200 U/mL formulation of insulin lispro will reflect those already established for 
the 100 U/mL formulation.  
The dedicated 200 U/mL KwikPen device has been developed from the 100 U/mL KwikPen device (in 
clinical use for many years). 
EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 27/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Although the human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device was 
carried out in an office environment (and not in situations reflecting real life), this may be accepted 
because of knowledge of experience of the 100 U/mL KwikPen device used with insulin lispro 100 U/mL.  
The goal of human factors engineering in medical device design development is to ensure that the device 
will be safe and effective to use. The company identified the intended users of the 200 U/mL KwikPen 
device and the tasks they had to perform to use the device effectively. Hazards were identified and 
eliminated or controlled and informed the proposed risk management plan. As a consequence, a formal 
clinical study of use has not been submitted. 
Benefit-risk balance 
On the basis of bioequivalence between the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation and the insulin lispro 200 
U/ml formulation, the positive benefit-risk balance of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation may also be 
claimed for the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation. Risks associated with the new formulation and 
KwikPen device have been identified and addressed by the human factor engineering study. The benefit 
risk balance of Liprolog 200 U/ml is therefore considered to be positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Liprolog 200 U/ml in the “treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus who 
require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Liprolog 200 units/ml KwikPen is also 
indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes mellitus” is favourable and therefore recommends  the 
granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 


EMA/CHMP/416298/2014  
Page 28/30 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall provide a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter (DHPC) and patient communication prior to 
launch  targeting  all  physicians  and  nurses  who  are  expected  to  be  involved  in  the  treatment  and 
management  of  diabetic patients  and,  where  required,  all  pharmacists  who  are  expected  to  dispense 
Liprolog.  
The target audience and the modalities for distribution all of these materials are to be agreed at Member 
State level. The MAH shall agree the final text of the Dear Healthcare Professional Communication letter 
and the content of the patient communication together with a communication plan, with the National 
Competent Authority in each Member State prior to launch of the product. 
The DHPC and patient communication are aimed at increasing awareness about the fact that Liprolog is 
now available in two strengths and describing key differences in the design of the packages and the 
prefilled pen devices to minimise the risk of medication errors and mix up between the two different 
strengths of Liprolog. 
The MAH shall ensure that healthcare professionals are informed that all patients who have been 
prescribed Liprolog should be trained on the correct use of the prefilled pen before prescribing or 
dispensing Liprolog.   
The DHPC should address the following key elements: 
 
Liprolog is now available in 2 strengths 
  Key features of the design of the package and prefilled pen device 
  When prescribing, to ensure that the correct strength is mentioned on the prescription 
 
Liprolog should not be used outside of the prefilled pen device  
  Dose conversion on switching from Liprolog U-100 to U-200 should not be performed 
  Medication errors or any side effects should be reported

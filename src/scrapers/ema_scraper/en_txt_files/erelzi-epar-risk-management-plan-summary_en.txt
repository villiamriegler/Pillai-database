Summary of the risk management plan for Erelzi 
(etanercept) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Erelzi, a biosimilar 
to Enbrel. The RMP details important risks of Erelzi, how these risks can be 
minimized, and how more information will be obtained about Erelzi’s risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
Erelzi’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet 
give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Erelzi should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Erelzi should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment 
Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in 
updates of Erelzi’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Erelzi  is  authorised  for  rheumatoid  arthritis,  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis, 
spondylitis,  non-radiographic  axial 
psoriatic  arthritis,  ankylosing 
spondyloarthritis,  plaque  psoriasis,  and  pediatric  plaque  psoriasis  (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains etanercept as the active substance 
and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Erelzi’s benefits can be found in 
Erelzi’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important risks of Erelzi, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Erelzi’s  risks,  are  outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on 
correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and 
healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen 
so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the 
patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Erelzi, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is 
collected continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment 
so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Erelzi  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Erelzi  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal 
product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as 
identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Erelzi. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Clinical trials and postmarketing data 
A potential effect of etanercept on growth and development is 
not known. Giannini et al (2010) reported that etanercept 
treatment, with or without methotrexate, may rather 
contribute to restoration of normal growth in children with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
There are currently no known risk groups or risk factors in 
patients following the administration of etanercept for events 
in growth and development.

Clinical trials and postmarketing data 
There is no strong evidence that TNF-α inhibitors including 
etanercept are associated with an increased risk of acute 
ischemic cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis by Roubille 
et al (2015) reported a reduced risk of all cardiovascular 
events in rheumatoid arthritis patients with TNFα inhibitors 
(risk ratio (RR), 0.70; 95% CI 0.54-0.90) and methotrexate 
(RR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.57-0.91). 
There are no known risk factors or subject groups at risk for 
the development of ischemic cardiovascular events with 
treatment with etanercept.

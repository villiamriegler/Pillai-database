2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of dopaminergic 
and serotonergic pathways that manifests in young children and most commonly results in complete 
arrest of motor development (Wassenberg 2017). AADC deficiency is due to the presence of 
pathological variants in the DDC gene that encodes for AADC, the enzyme responsible for the 
decarboxylation of L-DOPA and 5-HTP to form the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, 
respectively (Wassenberg 2017).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Although, the global incidence of AADC deficiency is not well understood, the disease is more prevalent 
in certain Asian populations, particularly in Taiwan and Japan. This is likely due to a founder splice site 
variant IVS6+4A>T (also designated as C.714+4A>T) that phenotypically results in complete motor 
development arrest (Lee 2009, Wassenberg 2017). 
The predicted birth rates of individuals with AADC deficiency are estimated to be between 1/42,000 to 
1/90,000 in the US (Hyland 2018, Whitehead 2018, Himmelreich 2019), and approximately 1/118,000 
in the European Union (Himmelreich 2019). A 1/90,000 birth-rate translates into a current estimate of 
about 840 living patients with AADC deficiency in the US (Himmelreich 2019). Given only about 123 
unique patients have been identified world-wide (Wassenberg 2017), it is clear that most individuals 
with this genetic disorder have not been diagnosed and that the disease is more prevalent than 
generally recognized (Whitehead 2018, Himmelreich 2019). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
In the normal human brain, AADC enzyme is present predominately in the brainstem, where it is 
produced in the substantia nigra of the midbrain (brainstem). Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra project into the striatum, which includes the putamen and caudate nuclei, and dopamine is 
released from these presynaptic terminals (Himmelreich 2019). Dopamine is required within the 
putamen to enable motor development and function. 
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase is a key component of highly interlinked catalytic and metabolic 
pathways that regulate levels of dopamine, and in turn, controls essential neurotransmitters such as 
norepinephrine and epinephrine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine deficiencies affect principally 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 14/132 
 
 
 
attention, mood, and sleep. The neurotransmitters affected by AADC are key for control of the 
sympathetic nervous system, mood, cognition, and motor coordination (Himmelreich 2019). 
AADC Genetics 
The DDC gene is located on chromosome 7p12.1-7p12.3 and contains 15 exons. The AADC enzyme, 
which has 480 amino acids, is highly conserved across species and is expressed in the brain, 
sympathetic ganglia, and adrenal medulla. DDC gene spans >107 kb and multiple alternatively spliced 
variants encoding different isoforms of the protein have been identified (Himmelreich 2019). Currently, 
across the 123 confirmed patients with AADC deficiency, 82 variants have been observed, of which 79 
are known to lead to AADC deficiency (Himmelreich 2019). The current list of DDC variants includes 58 
missenses, 6 frame-shift, 9 splice sites, 1 in-frame, 3 complex, and 2 nonsense mutations. In general, 
these variants affect the production, folding, conformation, and/or catalytic activity of AADC 
(Himmelreich 2019). 
Across the patients, 58 different genotypes have been identified; 19 were homozygous for the same 
variant and 39 were heterozygous. The most commonly observed genotype (gene frequency of 26.0%) 
is homozygous for the founder mutation that is common in certain Asian populations (i.e., 
c.[714+4A>T];[714+4A>T]) (Himmelreich 2019). The founder mutation is a splice site mutation that 
results in the production of a truncated AADC protein (Lee 2009). Importantly, to date, no genotype-
phenotype correlation has been reported (Wassenberg 2017, Himmelreich 2019). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with AADC deficiency are heterogenous and have a wide range of clinical presentation, likely 
reflecting the different forms of pathogenic variants (e.g., missense variants, deletions, etc.). Of 
reported cases of AADC deficiency, all patients had symptoms within the first year of life (onset of 
symptoms at 2.7 months) (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017) However, the median age of diagnosis was 
about 3.5 years, indicating the difficulties in recognizing, and subsequently delays in diagnosis, of the 
disease (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017). 
The AADC enzyme deficiency results in a marked or complete loss of dopamine production in the brain 
from birth. Consequently, AADC-deficient patients exhibit symptoms related to loss in dopamine 
signaling, affecting voluntary movements, cognitive functions, and emotion. Patients with AADC 
deficiency have arrested motor development despite essentially preserved neurophysiology and 
neuroanatomy as determined by brain imaging. These patients fail to achieve motor milestones typical 
of healthy children, such as full-head control and ability to sit, stand, or walk. Patients also experience 
intellectual disability and show irritability, and are at risk of death in the first decade of life (Korenke 
1997, Pons 2004, Helman 2014). A systematic literature review of AADC deficiency through December 
2015 described and catalogued 117 patients worldwide (Wassenberg 2017). Adequate information was 
available to assess the overall impact of AADC deficiency on motor development for 103 patients. 
AADC deficiency that results in complete arrest of motor development, the most common phenotype 
identified by Wassenberg and colleagues, was observed in 80% of patients (82 of 103 cases) and was 
also characterized by failure to gain adequate head control or the ability to sit, stand, or walk. AADC 
deficiency with motor development is the most infrequent phenotype (identified in only 6 of 103 cases, 
or 6%), and is defined as a delay in developmental milestone acquisition but with eventual 
achievement of ambulation. Patients with this phenotype still have profound motor deficits, as they 
continue to be disabled without full motor function and have impaired intellectual function.

Comparison of Milestones of Patients with AADC Deficiency and Healthy 
Children  
The phenotype of AADC deficiency is a spectrum, with disease severity appearing independent of 
gender (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017). Overall, AADC-deficient patients have decreased contact, 
social interaction, alertness, and sleep disorders. They also have loss of appetite and impairment of 
memory and learning, body temperature regulation, cardiovascular functions, and hormone secretions. 
The most common symptoms of AADC deficiency are hypotonia, movement disorders, developmental 
delays, and autonomic disorders (Himmelreich 2019). The most frequent motor disorders include 
oculogyric crisis and/or dystonia. Common autonomic symptoms are ptosis and excessive sweating 
(Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017). 
Less common symptoms include sleep disturbance, epileptic seizures, and sleep apnoea. Symptoms 
associated with behaviour, such as irritability, dysphoria, excessive crying, and those similar to autism 
are common and can be the most taxing for patients/caregivers (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017). 
The most common non-neurologic symptoms are gastrointestinal such as diarrhoea, constipation, 
feeding difficulties, and gastroesophageal reflux (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 2017). 
Typical Signs and Symptoms Reported in Patients with AADC Deficiency 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current Standard of Care for AADC Deficiency 
The consensus paper from Wassenberg detailed a review of the literature that included the systematic 
reporting by Brun and colleagues to assess AADC-deficient patient responses to dopamine agonists, 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and pyridoxine therapies (Brun 2010). Among the 117 AADC-
Assessment report

Page 16/132 
 
 
 
 
 
deficient patients identified in Wassenberg’s guideline, 56 received dopamine agonists, with 
bromocriptine and pergolide being used most frequently. Limited improvement in head control, 
hypotonia, voluntary movements, OGC, and autonomic symptoms have been reported in some 
patients. However, the use of dopamine agonists is associated with side effects, including weight loss, 
failure to thrive, and mild to severe dyskinesia, thus limiting the use of these medications in children 
with AADC deficiency who already have difficulty gaining weight over time or have failure to thrive. 
Thirty-one of the 117 patients with AADC deficiency received an MAO inhibitor; all 31 patients also 
received dopamine agonists and/or pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Most reports of patients with AADC 
deficiency treated with MAO inhibitors reported modest improvement in a single symptom (e.g., 
hypotonia), while some reported no clinical improvement or only a temporary improvement, although 
side effects appeared to be rare. In patients with AADC deficiency with arrested motor development, 
despite these available therapies, the progression of AADC deficiency was not attenuated. 
2.2.  About the product 
Eladocagene Exuparvovec 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is a sterile, parenteral formulation gene therapy indicated for the treatment 
of patients with AADC deficiency. Eladocagene exuparvovec contains the active biological substance 
rAAV2-hAADC (a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 [rAAV2] vector containing the human 
DDC gene and coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cDNA) that encodes the human aromatic L-amino 
acid decarboxylase [hAADC]) and compendial excipients. Eladocagene exuparvovec is delivered to cells 
in the putamen of the brain, resulting in increased production of the enzyme AADC. 
Figure 1 Diagram of Eladocagene Exuparvovec Expression Cassette 
Vector Selection (AAV2) 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is an adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vector with a known safety profile and 
local persistence at area of administration, i.e., the vector does not integrate into the host genome. 
The vector will be infused directly to the central nervous system (CNS) and specifically to the putamen 
to maximize target tissue expression and hence local exposure while limiting off-target tissue effects. 
AAV is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus commonly used as a gene therapy vector for 
a variety of applications in the brain given its established safety profile, lack of pathogenicity, and 
ability to transduce quiescent (non-dividing) cells, particularly neurons (Hocquemiller 2016). 
Recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) was chosen as the vector for delivery due to its neurotropic properties, its 
demonstrated long-term gene expression in the CNS, and the extensive testing of this serotype in 
nonclinical species and humans, including patients with Parkinson’s disease, where AADC activity, 
dopamine induction, and motor function improvement and safety were demonstrated. In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

rAAV2 has shown long-term gene expression in vivo, which offers a treatment for genetic diseases 
affecting the nervous system. 
Recombinant AAVs (rAAV) were developed to package DNA cassettes within a 4.7Kb size constraint 
flanked by 145 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITR). This sequence ensures that the inserted DNA 
cassette will become an extrachromosomal episome (Gray 2010). The rAAV2 capsid used to deliver 
eladocagene exuparvovec to the putamen contains no replication or protein encoding genes of AAV, 
nor does it contain DNA sequences that allow integration into the host genome, which reduce the risks 
of recombination events and transformation. 
Intraputaminal Route of Administration 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is being infused into the putamen to treat AADC deficiency. The rationale for 
the delivery of the gene therapy into the putamen is as follows: 
• 
Local delivery of eladocagene exuparvovec reduces the chance of expression of AADC enzyme, 
and possibly mis-expression of dopamine or serotonin, in non-targeted areas of the brain and 
adverse effects. 
•  Delivery of rAAV2-AADC containing the same AAV2 capsid, transgene promoter, and ITR’s as in 
eladocagene exuparvovec resulted in AADC protein expression, enzyme activity, and dopamine 
production in mouse, rats, and non-human primates (Sanchez-Pernaute 2001, Muramatsu 
2002, Bankiewicz 2006, Forsayeth 2006, Cunningham 2008b). 
• 
Injection of the rAAV2-hAADC vector into the bilateral putamen of humans with Parkinson’s 
disease resulted in increased AADC activity and reduction of disease symptoms (Christine 
2009, Muramatsu 2010). 
The rAAV2-hAADC vectors used in these studies contained the same wild-type AAV2 capsid and human 
DDC cDNA as eladocagene exuparvovec.  Based on these intra-putaminal dosing studies with the 
AAV2-hAADC vector in Parkinson’s disease patients, which induced dopamine induction in these 
patients, the intra-putaminal route of administration was selected for AADC deficiency clinical studies 
with eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Mechanism of Action 
Two main possibilities are posited for the means by which eladocagene exuparvovec achieves 
appropriate expression of the AADC enzyme: retrograde transport of the virus to transduce substantia 
nigra neurons (Hadaczek 2016) and/or direct transduction by the virus of cells in the putamen in situ. 
Following eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy, virus particles may be internalized by dopaminergic 
presynaptic terminals, transported back to the cell body in the substantia nigra, transcribed into 
mRNA, and synthesized into AADC protein (enzyme). The AADC enzyme then converts L-DOPA to 
dopamine, which is incorporated into vesicles and stored in the presynaptic terminal for release into 
the synaptic cleft upon nerve stimulation to modulate neuronal control of motor activity. Alternatively, 
virus particles may be internalized by cells in the putamen, transcribed and translated to AADC protein 
(enzyme), which could then convert available L-DOPA to dopamine. Dopamine would then be packaged 
and released to modulate neuronal control of motor activity.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Upstaza is a gene therapy medicinal product indicated for the treatment of patients with AADC 
deficiency. Upstaza contains the rAAV2-hAADC (a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 
[rAAV2] vector containing the human DDC gene and coding deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) that encodes 
the human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase [hAADC]) and compendial excipients. Upstaza is 
presented as a solution for infusion and delivered to cells in the putamen of the brain, resulting in 
increased production of the enzyme AADC. 
The finished product is presented as a sterile, clear to slightly opaque, colourless to faint-white 
solution. The finished product formulation is comprised of compendial excipients including potassium 
chloride, sodium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and 
poloxamer 188 in water for injections, at a pH 6.9. Each vial of finished product contains an 
extractable volume of 0.5 mL with a total of 2.8×1011 vector genome copies (vg). Each vial is for single 
use only and this medicinal product should only be infused with the SmartFlow ventricular cannula. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (AS) is eladocagene exuparvovec which is a rAAV2 comprising a human dopa 
decarboxylase variant 2 cDNA transcript, which encodes hAADC isoform 1, under the control of the 
cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and SV40 poly A transcription terminator. The wild type 
AAV2 genome (with the exception of the flanking inverted terminal repeats (ITRs)) has been replaced 
with the therapeutic transgene expression cassette.  
Figure 2 Diagram of Eladocagene exuparvovec expression cassette 
The eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy contains no replication or protein encoding genes of 
adeno-associated virus (AAV). The infectivity, transgene expression and hAADC enzymatic activity 
attributes contribute collectively to the overall biological activity of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Properties potentially affecting biological activity include primary, secondary, tertiary and higher-order 
structure of the AAV2 capsid and the sequence of the hAADC expression cassette. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is based on the naturally-occurring AAV serotype 2, which is abundantly 
circulated and has not been typically associated with human disease. Manufacture of eladocagene 
exuparvovec requires the use of a dual-plasmid transfection process and the recombinant AAV2 
capsids are produced in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell expression system.

Recombinant AAVs (rAAV) were developed to package DNA cassettes within a 4.7Kb size constraint. 
This sequence ensures that the inserted DNA cassette will become an extrachromosomal episome. The 
rAAV2 capsid used to deliver eladocagene exuparvovec DNA to the putamen contains no replication or 
protein encoding genes of AAV, nor does it contain DNA sequences that allow integration into the host 
genome, which reduce the risks of recombination events and transformation. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Several deficiencies were noted regarding valid GMP certificates which resulted in a major objection at 
Day 120. The active substance manufacturing facility, MassBiologics South Coast, 1240 Innovation 
Way, Fall River, Massachusetts 02720, USA has now been inspected by the supervisory authority and a 
valid EU GMP certificate has been issued.  
The active substance release and stability testing site has also been inspected by the supervisory 
authority and an EU GMP certificate has been issued. The major objection has been resolved.  
Manufacturing process 
The commercial process is process C. The active substance is manufactured by transient transfection of 
human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells with transgene and helper plasmids. 
The upstream and downstream manufacturing process has been described in the dossier, including a 
flow diagram and narrative of how each step is performed. Each upstream manufacturing run is 
initiated with thawing of HEK 293 cell bank vials followed passaging to expand the cell culture, 
transfection with plasmids, cell harvest, and washing into cell pellets.  
The cell pellets are stored frozen prior to initiating the downstream manufacturing process. The 
downstream process consists of purifying the harvest pellets with unit operations of cell lysis and 
clarification, affinity chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, cation-exchange 
chromatography, and buffer exchange and concentration by diafiltration/ultrafiltration (DF/UF). The 
retentate is filtered and transferred to a bag, resulting in the active substance. Samples are taken to 
perform active substance release testing. The active substance is frozen until initiation of the finished 
product manufacturing process.  
Critical process parameters (CPPs), key process parameters (KPPs), critical process attributes (CPAs) 
and key process attributes (KPAs) are included in the manufacturing process description.  
Control of Materials  
All raw materials are sourced from approved suppliers with defined controls and specifications. 
Specifications have been defined and all raw materials have been qualified for their intended uses. The 
cell banks and plasmids are defined as starting materials to be used in manufacturing of eladocagene 
exuparvovec.  
Cell banks: 
The cell line used in the eladocagene exuparvovec manufacturing process is the HEK 293 cell line.  
The source, generation and history of the producer cell banks used for clinical batches and for 
manufacturing process development have been provided. The master cell bank (MCB) has been 
characterised in line with the general principles of ICH Q5D, Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 and ICH Q5A. Issues were 
identified with the proposed WCB, including low viable cell density observed across expansion steps of 
a production batch, which resulted in termination of the batch and triggered an investigation. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 20/132 
 
 
 
proposal in the Day 120 responses was to launch commercial production initially with the MCB and 
then to introduce the WCB once investigation is resolved post-authorisation. In general, the new WCB 
has been characterised in line with ICH Q5A, ICH Q5D and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 and may be suitable. 
However, some data is still awaited before this WCB can be approved for commercial manufacture. At 
this time, the proposed WCB has been removed from the dossier and will be registered post-
authorisation when all necessary data is available. Overall, the major objection is resolved as 
commercial manufacture from the MCB is sufficiently justified until such time as the WCB can be 
introduced. It has been confirmed that the WCB will be registered.   
Future cell banks for commercial production will be manufactured under GMP. A protocol for monitoring 
banked cell stability has been provided and the procedure to generate and qualify future production 
cell banks is acceptable. The cell banks are being stored under GMP.  
Plasmids: 
Two starting material plasmids are described: the transgene plasmid and the helper plasmid which 
carries the AAV2 CAP and REP genes and the AdV helper genes necessary for replication and for the 
packaging of the transgene into the capsid. The structural elements of the plasmids have been 
described and details of functional components presented. The full nucleotide sequence of both 
plasmids is presented in the dossier.  
Plasmid production is based on a bacterial cell bank system. It is noted that a single-tiered banking 
system is proposed; this has been justified in the context of anticipated cell bank usage. The 
information regarding the bacterial MCB generation and qualification is sufficient and, in general, meets 
the requirements for bacterial cells used for the manufacture of plasmids vectors for human use as 
specified in Ph. Eur. 5.14. The cell banks have been generated using standard methodology. 
In general, the characterisation/qualification of plasmid cell banks described in the dossier follow the 
principles outlined in the aforementioned general chapter of the Ph. Eur., including full sequencing of 
the plasmids in the bacterial cell banks. A protocol has been provided describing testing to be 
performed on bacterial end of production cells banks (EOPCB) which is acceptable. The cell bank 
stability monitoring program has been registered in the dossier. Adventitious agents screening of the 
MCBs is in line with Ph. Eur. 5.14 and the bacterial cell banks have also been tested for the absence of 
lytic and lysogenic bacteriophage particles. 
The plasmids for commercial use will be manufactured under GMP. The manufacturing process for the 
plasmids has been adequately described and includes a risk assessment regarding the suitability of the 
downstream process for impurity removal. The specifications for the plasmids are presented in the 
dossier and, in general, are in line with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.14.  
Raw materials: 
A list of compendial raw materials has been provided in the dossier. The specifications presented for 
non-compendial raw materials used during the manufacturing process are considered to be 
appropriate. With cross reference to the section on Adventitious agents, the applicant has provided a 
risk assessment on the potential of the manufacturing process to remove small virus particles and 
intends to perform a viral clearance study for the process.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters and in-process controls for the upstream and downstream manufacturing 
process are described in the dossier. Confirmed excursions to established process control strategy 
ranges are investigated depending on the classification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 21/132 
 
 
 
The control strategy for the upstream culture process is acceptable and includes appropriate KPPs and 
KPAs to control for cell performance and bioburden.  
The control strategy for harvest complies with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.14: CPAs are in place for 
identification, vector concentration, extraneous agents (Ph. Eur. 2.6.16) and control cell testing (Ph. 
Eur. 2.6.16 and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3).  
In general, the process parameters and process attributes defined are standard and appropriate. Data 
was requested and has been provided to support all proposed hold times for intermediates with respect 
to stability and microbiological purity.  
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process is undergoing process performance qualification (PPQ) at 
MassBiologics. A concurrent process validation strategy was proposed in the initial dossier.  
During the first PPQ run (PPQ1), a number of deviations in the upstream process and downstream 
process against the validation criteria were identified. Furthermore, the data from the process 
demonstration runs lacked completeness and clarity and was not sufficient to support the proposed 
concurrent validation strategy. This formed the basis of a major objection at Day 120. With the 
response to the major objection, a lack of impact to the validity of PPQ1 was not agreed with respect 
to several deviations.  
Taking into account the above issues, the proposed concurrent validation strategy was still not agreed 
at Day 170. In addition, it was requested that data from additional full-scale PPQ batches (AS and FP) 
be provided to support that the entire process performs in a consistent manner and meets the 
validation acceptance criteria for process parameters and attributes.  
In the response to the Day 170 major objection on process validation, the applicant maintained their 
position that a concurrent validation approach is appropriate based on the serious and highly morbid 
nature of the disease, coupled with the lack of approved therapies. Full PPQ2 data is provided in the 
response and detailed justification is presented in relation to all deviations for both PPQ1 and PPQ2. In 
addition, it is noted that the filter integrity deviation for PPQ1 did not recur in PPQ2 and the microbial 
control strategy has been tightened. In response to the request for data on filter compatibility using 
product specific material (AS intermediates, AS and FP), it is proposed to bridge the existing validation 
data (performed with formulation buffer) to process-specific vector containing matrices post-marketing 
authorisation (MA). This proposal is acceptable on the grounds that (i) the filter deviations during 
PPQ1/2 appear to relate to isolated root causes (not related to sample matrix) and (ii) the control 
strategy has been updated to require that both finished product sterile filters pass filter integrity 
testing. The study will establish that the relevant physiochemical properties of the formulation buffer 
are highly comparable to the process matrices and this data can be provided as a recommendation. 
The data presented for finished product PPQ1 and PPQ2 is supportive of a concurrent validation 
strategy for the finished product and the data should be provided as part of an Annex II condition. 
The other potentially impactful deviations from active substance PPQ1 have been discussed in detail, 
the root cause was assigned and corrective actions implemented. Although some deviations occurred 
(with respect to KPPs/KPAs), none were determined to impact product quality, overall process 
performance or the validity of the PPQ runs. All PPQ protocol acceptance criteria CPPs, CPAs were met, 
with exception of two deviations relating to operator error. All release criteria were met for PPQ1 and 
PPQ2, with the exception of residual DNA levels of the host cell derived genes of Adenovirus early 
region 1A/1B E1A/E1B during PPQ2. All protocol validation criteria (KPPs and KPAs) were met, with the 
exception of several deviations. Although the number of deviations is notable, it is accepted that 
appropriate actions have been implemented and that they do not impact on the validity of the active 
substance PPQ runs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 22/132 
 
 
 
However, the failure of active substance PPQ2 to meet the active substance release specification for 
E1A/E1B residual DNA was not considered acceptable as it undermines the validity of this batch. The 
major objection to the concurrent validation strategy for active substance was maintained at Day 189. 
Further data was requested to substantiate the claim that the higher observed level of E1A/E1B in 
PPQ2 was related to method variability and that this batch is consistent with historical batches. The 
major objection also requested the revision of the method to minimise factors contributing to method 
variability and the tightening of the proposed specification for E1A/E1B. In the response to the day 189 
major objection, data was presented using a new quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
method for control of residual E1A and E1B DNA. The method includes appropriate standard curve 
controls and assay validity criteria and has been fully validated in line with ICH Q2. The batch results 
for PPQ2 are within the range of historical results and the specifications for E1A/E1B were tightened. 
The major objection is resolved and the concurrent validation approach is accepted. The provision of 
the data on the final active substance PPQ batch (PPQ3) will be addressed as an Annex II condition. 
PPQ will be completed using the MCB as starting material.  
A risk assessment has been provided regarding the potential for leachables/extractables across all 
product contact materials used during the manufacturing process. Overall, the formulation buffer 
components are considered low risk during routine processing and this rationale is agreed. The elements 
of the filtration assembly are considered low risk given that they are standard pharmacopoeial grade 
materials used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. 
According to the outlined process validation (PV) strategy, ongoing process verification is proposed. A 
high-level summary of the process verification strategy has been included. Overall, the approach 
appears reasonable. 
Manufacturing process development  
A summary of the process changes made throughout development, and their potential risk to impact 
product quality, form part of the comparability assessment, and are discussed below in the finished 
product section (Pharmaceutical development).  
The control strategy includes three parameter and attribute tiers: critical, key and monitoring. Process 
parameters and process attributes were evaluated using a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) 
which is described in the updated dossier. All process parameter and product attribute ranges were 
defined on the basis of historical manufacturing ranges including from the technology transfer runs 
with the exception of a select number of parameters whose ranges are supported by development 
studies. The acceptance criteria for a number of process parameters have been tightened and a more 
thorough justification has been presented to support the proposed control strategy against historical 
manufacturing experience.  
In the case of the upstream process, the representativeness of runs used to define the control strategy 
has been justified. In general, the data provided supports the proposed ranges for the CPPs/KPPs for 
the upstream process. For the downstream process control strategy, multiple partial and at-scale 
manufacturing runs (representative of commercial process) were executed during process development 
to evaluate the impact of changes introduced as part of technology transfer. Data has been presented 
to support the representativeness of these small-scale studies. The majority of parameter and attribute 
ranges defined for the revised control strategy fall within the ranges observed for the commercial-scale 
historical batches.  
In accordance with ICH Q11, the development of eladocagene exuparvovec has followed a traditional 
development approach establishing process control ranges based on manufacturing process history and 
process development studies. The CQAs for the active substance have been appropriately defined. A 
comprehensive assessment of CQA control points across the process, assessed at the unit operation

level, has also been provided and supports the proposed process control strategy. Overall, the updated 
control strategy is acceptable and the major objection is resolved. However, the number of batches 
produced with the commercial process is limited. As such, while the proposed acceptance ranges for 
process parameters and attributes for routine control and PV seem adequate, they should be revised 
after a further ten active substance batches have been manufactured.  
The revised section 3.2.S.2.6 of the dossier also included additional data to support appropriate 
process development. The removal of the density gradient ultracentrifugation step from the 
manufacturing process was queried as this resulted in a significant increase in empty capsids for the 
process B and process C materials. It has been clarified that PTC Therapeutics International Limited 
acquired the product after pivotal trials had been completed with the process B material and data has 
been presented to demonstrate relatively consistent levels of full particles across clinical and process C 
commercial materials. While the removal of the gradient ultracentrifugation could be seen as a 
retrograde step in terms of process, it is claimed that the ratio of empty/full capsids for commercial 
product is comparable to levels dosed in the pivotal clinical trial. This point was not entirely agreed and 
was further discussed in the response to the major objection on comparability (from D120 list of 
questions (LoQ)). Further justification was also provided to support downstream clearance of 
impurities.  
Characterisation 
Characterisation of active substance includes analysis of primary structure, higher order structure, 
product-related variants and potency/strength. The use of only a single batch of finished product (pilot 
scale reference standard) for characterisation of primary structure, higher order structure and potency 
was considered to be too limited and was queried. The representativeness of the pilot scale reference 
standard for the commercial process has been demonstrated. Additional characterisation data has now 
been presented for several further lots representative of the commercial process and is acceptable. The 
additional characterisation used either active substance or finished product since both have the same 
formulation. The added data include characterisation of the primary structure, higher order structure, 
potency of these batches. In addition, consistency of molecular weight/ratio of VPI/VP2/VP3 across 
commercial batches has been demonstrated. Data on post-translational modifications (PTMs) was 
requested and has been provided. The detected PTMs were similar across all the lots analysed. The 
comparability data demonstrated that although there were differences in the levels of PTMs observed 
amongst the clinical, PPQ and process demonstration lots, there was no clear impact on infectivity or 
titer. The applicant will test the PTM levels of each PPQ lot manufactured after that data is available. 
This is acceptable.   
Product related impurities have been assessed using a range of methods and the information is, in 
general, sufficient. According to the results a number of truncated VP3 residues were identified. The 
relative levels of these truncated VP3 fragments has been presented for process C batches. Levels 
observed are low and relatively consistent and it has been confirmed that no clinical impact is expected 
from these impurities. Full capsid vs empty capsids were evaluated using two methodologies. The 
results are relatively consistent across batches. Given the high percentage of empty/intermediate 
capsules in the active substance, further characterisation of these species was requested, i.e. the 
potential for deleted, rearranged, hybrid DNA sequences or co-packaged extraneous DNA to be present 
was queried. The results of next generation sequencing were provided for several commercially 
representative batches and supports a low level of co-packaged DNA. The results of support that most 
of the DNA in the product contains intact vector sequence and there is a very low likelihood of 
significant rearrangement or recombination. Data was provided on plasmid, E1A/E1B, Rep and Cap 
DNA for a number of representative batches confirming relatively low levels and the absence of 
transcriptional potential of contaminating DNA.

The risk for any known oncogenic/tumorigenic sequences present in the production system has been 
discussed. The only known oncogenic sequences are E1A and E1B and these are controlled in the 
active substance specifications. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The active substance release and shelf life specification include tests for appearance, identity, potency, 
purity and safety. The release specification established covers most of the relevant characteristics of 
AAV vectors and complies with the general principles of EMA/CAT/80183/2014 and Ph. Eur. 5.14. It 
was requested to include a test for genetic characterisation of the vector DNA and the applicant’s 
proposal to verify vector DNA integrity is acceptable. In addition, it was confirmed that the test was 
performed for active substance as a characterisation test for all batches manufactured to date including 
the PPQ batches, confirming that the commercial manufacturing process consistently yields a vector 
that has the expected genomic integrity.  
Empty capsids represent a significant product related impurity. A specification for control of full and 
empty AAV particles and method validation data has been provided. The applicant is recommended to 
investigate and introduce appropriate process improvements to reduce the levels of empty capsids in 
the product.  
Given the limited amount of clinical data, it is acknowledged that it may be very challenging to 
determine clinically qualified levels of impurities. However, in general, it was considered that 
specifications should be narrowed to more closely reflect available batch analysis data and some 
rationale presented as to how specifications are considered to be clinically justified. In response, the 
specifications have been further justified and is accepted.  
A general recommendation is made that all active substance release specifications should be re-
evaluated after 10 further active substance batches are manufactured. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods for control of active substance, as described in the dossier, were lacking in 
detail and this was queried in the Day 120 list of questions. The requested information has now been 
registered in the dossier. The identity of the commercial kits has been specified in the dossier and the 
controls in place to ensure consistency between different lots of commercial kits has been described. 
The controls in place to ensure consistent cell performance during the cell culture portion of the 
relevant assays have been justified.  
More comprehensive method validation summaries have been provided in response to the Day 120 
questions and an updated method validation has been presented for some assays. In general, method 
validation is in line with ICH Q2.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data is presented for several commercial scale batches including PPQ batches. All 
batches meet the specifications.  
Reference standard 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 25/132 
 
 
 
 
 
The reference standard is a commercially representative (process C) pilot scale lot manufactured at 
process development labs. The representativeness of this material for the commercial process has 
been demonstrated.  
Comparability of the process C material for clinical material has been extensively discussed. A 
qualification protocol for future reference standards has been provided and is acceptable.  
Container closure 
The container closure system for the eladocagene exuparvovec active substance is a sterile Bioprocess 
container. Mechanical and physiochemical suitability, biocompatibility information as well as 
extractables data have been summarised in the dossier. In general, the specifications for container 
closure are acceptable and confirmation of compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.2.1 Plastic containers for 
aqueous solutions for infusion and Ph. Eur. 3.2.2 Plastic containers and closures for pharmaceutical use 
has been provided. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Long-term data at -80 ± 15°C is available for three batches representative of the commercial scale 
process demonstration batches and supports the proposed active substance shelf life. Accelerated data 
(5 ± 3°C) is available for one batch. In the response, it has been agreed to continue the accelerated 
and stressed studies for 3 months. All quality parameters meet the specification limits after 3 freeze-
thaw cycles.  
In conclusion, the claimed shelf life for the active substance when stored at the recommended storage 
condition is acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
Eladocagene exuparvovec finished product is a sterile, clear to slightly opaque, colourless to faint-white 
solution. Each vial of finished product contains an extractable volume of 0.5 mL with a total of 
2.8×1011 vector genome copies (vg). Each mL of solution contains 5.6 × 1011 vg of eladocagene 
exuparvovec. Each vial is for single use only. This medicinal product should only be infused with the 
SmartFlow ventricular cannula. 
The finished product is comprised of compendial excipients including potassium chloride, sodium 
chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and poloxamer 188 in water 
for injections.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The first batch used in a non-clinical and clinical study was manufactured and is called Process A. 
Subsequently two further lots were manufactured and were used in an additional non-clinical and two 
further clinical studies (Process B). The clinical experience with the product is limited. The 
manufacturing process was transferred to a new site, and the process was significantly changed to 
develop the current manufacturing process called Process C.  
The commercial manufacturing process includes the addition of a new excipient, poloxamer 188. 
Although poloxamer 188 is part of the formulation of several approved parenteral medicinal products, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 26/132 
 
 
 
none of these products are administered via an intraputaminal route of administration. Poloxamer 188 
is therefore classified as a novel excipient due to the new route of administration. Nonetheless, as 
poloxamer 188 is controlled according to the relevant Ph. Eur. monograph, the quality information 
provided on this excipient is acceptable. The other excipients are present in other authorised products 
using routes of administration with direct delivery to the central nervous system. 
Apart from the addition of poloxamer 188, many significant and substantial changes were introduced 
as part of the Process C manufacturing process. A comparability exercise was presented in which the 
applicant compared several finished product batches from the three manufacturing processes. The 
Process A and B batches were used in clinical studies and none of the commercial Process C batches 
have been used in clinical studies. The analytical comparability exercise included tests for potency, 
identity product-related purity, process-related impurities and safety.  
In general, the panel of tests is considered reasonably comprehensive for the purposes of 
demonstrating comparability of an AAV product. Overall, it remains uncertain whether the commercial 
batches have comparable biological activity and comparable levels of empty capsids compared to the 
clinical batches. However, as there are no more samples from Process A and B batches available, no 
further information which could aid in regulatory decision making can be obtained from these batches. 
Therefore, no further questions are raised from a quality perspective. The remaining uncertainty on 
comparability was considered acceptable in the context of the overall benefit/risk decision.  
A standard risk assessment approach was used to identify the CQAs based on impact and uncertainty 
and the final list of CQAs covers the relevant attributes of identity, potency, purity and safety. A 
summary of the control strategy was provided and includes set points, acceptable ranges and historical 
ranges for process parameters (PPs), critical process parameters (CPPs), and IPCs. The dossier states 
that the criticality of each process parameter was set based on the underlying chemistry and biology, 
the variability and impact to CQAs and regulatory requirements. It is generally expected that a 
thorough justification should be provided for each process parameter that is deemed to be non-critical. 
However, in this case the majority of process parameters are designated as critical, the approach is 
therefore acceptable. 
The CE marked SmartFlow cannula was used for the in-use compatibility study. Results were presented 
from this in-use study for vector titre, purity, and in vitro potency; the results showed that interaction 
with the cannula did not significantly impact these CQAs. A CE certificate for the SmartFlow cannula 
has been provided and the SmartFlow cannula is a referenced medical device in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The commercial manufacturing and testing facilities for eladocagene exuparvovec finished product are 
provided in the dossier. Appropriate evidence of GMP has been provided for the manufacturing and 
testing sites. 
Manufacture 
The physicochemical and biological properties of finished product are the same as those described for 
the eladocagene exuparvovec active substance. The finished product manufacturing process is 
relatively straightforward and involves active substance thaw, dilution with formulation buffer, sterile 
filtration, filling and freezing. A flow diagram of the manufacturing process has been provided which 
includes the relevant CPPs and IPCs associated with each step. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 27/132 
 
 
 
Overall, the manufacturing process is considered straightforward and, in general, has been described 
in sufficient detail.  
Process controls 
The process controls include CPPs, KPPs, CPAs, and KPAs. Further details of the definition of these 
controls can be found in the active substance section. Overall, the control strategy as described in 
P.3.4 is considered generally acceptable. 
Process validation / verification 
The applicant proposes to use a concurrent process validation strategy. Overall, given that the finished 
product manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and given the indication, a concurrent 
process validation strategy for the remaining finished product PPQ batch is acceptable. Nonetheless, 
given that a number of deviations have occurred during active substance and finished product process 
validation, the data from this finished product concurrent process validation batch is formally 
requested by an Annex II condition. 
Data on mixing studies has been provided which shows that the registered number of manual 
inversions will result in a homogeneous product. A plan for the collection of data on content uniformity 
in further PPQ batches has been provided and is acceptable. 
The proposed hold times are supported by accelerated stability studies. The fill duration is supported 
by media fill studies.  
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The proposed specifications include relevant tests for identity, potency, purity and safety. The 
commercial release and shelf life specifications for finished product. 
The proposed panel of tests are generally in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the quality, 
non-clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal products (EMA/CAT/80183/2014) and Ph. 
Eur. 5.14 Gene transfer medicinal products for human use.  
A risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities was provided and 
confirmed that no risks are associated with the manufacturing process, equipment, primary packaging, 
or excipients. No additional testing is considered necessary.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with 
the ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities. The risk of carryover of elemental impurities from 
reagents and materials used for manufacture is considered negligible and no additional control is 
required. 
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the acceptance criteria after ten batches have been 
manufactured and revise them if necessary. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The majority of release tests for the finished product are either described in the active substance 
section or are compendial.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data are provided from several batches from the different processes. All batches were well within 
the specification limits. The data from the several Process C lots show a good degree of consistency 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 28/132 
 
 
 
and support the conclusion that the finished product manufacturing process in under a sufficient level 
of control.  
Reference standard 
Eladocagene Exuparvovec reference standards are prepared from the active substance and are used 
for release and stability testing of active substance batches as well as finished product lots. The 
reference standard is described in Section S.5. 
Container Closure System 
The container closure system is a Type I borosilicate glass vial, with a siliconised chlorobutyl stopper 
with coating sealed with an aluminium/plastic cap. The vial complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and the 
stopper complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9.  
Specifications and technical drawings have been provided for the vial stopper and cap and are 
considered acceptable. Sufficient information on the selection of the container closure system is 
provided. The selected container closure system supports product stability and is suitable for its 
intended use. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A 24 month shelf life at the long term storage condition of ≤ -65°C is claimed for the finished product. 
Stability data for Process C batches have been provided for up to 24 months for four batches, and 
supportive data of up to 18 months for an additional batch.  
No significant trends were observed and the stability data are supportive of the claimed 24 month shelf 
life at the recommended storage conditions. Adequate data from accelerated, stress, and free-thaw 
studies was also provided and are acceptable. Once thawed, the medicinal product should not be 
re-frozen. The filled syringe prepared under aseptic conditions for delivery to the surgical site should 
be used immediately; if not used immediately, it can be stored at room temperature (below 25°C) and 
used within 6 hours of starting product thaw. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
The applicant has provided an overview of the facility controls and process controls which may have a 
role in the reduction or clearance of viruses, as supported by literature sources. In addition, as viral 
clearance studies are possible for AAV vector products, the applicant has presented a plan for a post-
approval viral clearance study in accordance with ICH Q5A using a panel of model viruses.  
The downstream process includes a number of steps which are expected to have viral clearance 
capacity. Moreover, the applicant intends to perform a viral clearance study and will submit results.  
2.4.3.6.  GMO 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is a genetically modified organism (GMO) constructed using recombinant 
DNA technology from wild-type (wt) AAV virus serotype 2 (wild type AAV2), which is a non-pathogenic, 
single-stranded DNA genome-containing, helper virus-dependent member of the parvovirus family. For 
further information, see the non-clinical section.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance is eladocagene exuparvovec, a recombinant non-replicating adeno-associated 
virus serotype 2 vector comprising of a dopa decarboxylase variant 2 cDNA transcript, which encodes 
human aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase isoform 1. The active substance and finished product 
manufacturing and testing sites have been inspected by an EU authority and the EU-GMP certificates 
have been issued. The major objection relating to GMP has been resolved.  
A major objection was raised on the control strategy for the active substance manufacturing process at 
Day 120 but has been resolved. Given the limited manufacturing experience, the proposed acceptance 
ranges for process parameters and attributes for routine control and PV should be re-evaluated and 
revised, as appropriate, after a further ten active substance batches have been manufactured.  
A major objection was raised regarding the suitability of the cell banks. Sufficient assurance has now 
been provided regarding the GMP status of the MCB and the failed WCB has been removed from the 
dossier. On these grounds, the major objection is resolved. A new WCB has been generated but is not 
yet fully qualified. Given that that sufficient assurance has been provided regarding the GMP status of 
the MCB, it is acceptable to use the MCB for commercial manufacture and to register the new WCB at a 
later date through a recommendation. 
A major objection was raised in relation to the process validation data at Day 120 and the proposal to 
use a concurrent validation strategy. The process validation was not considered sufficient to support a 
marketing authorisation. This major objection is now resolved subsequent to the introduction of a new 
validated E1A/E1B method and retesting of PPQ2 and historical batches to demonstrate consistent 
batch results. The proposed concurrent validation approach is acceptable. However, while it is accepted 
that process consistency has been sufficiently supported at this point, there were numerous deviations 
and issues with the AS/FP PPQ runs which resulted in a maintained major objection until Day 189. As 
some of these deviations related to process controls required to meet CQAs, it is considered that 
process validation should be completed as part of an Annex II condition. This is on the grounds that 
failure to demonstrate a consistent process capable of meeting CQAs relevant to patient safety would 
impact on the benefit risk of the product.  
The active substance has been appropriately characterised. The release specifications for the active 
substance cover most of the relevant characteristics of AAV vectors and complies with the general 
principles of EMA/CAT/80183/2014 and Ph. Eur. 5.14.  
The specification for total capsids and full/empty capsids has been tightened as much as feasible and 
aligned to manufacturing experience. Nonetheless, the applicant is recommended to investigate and 
introduce appropriate process improvements to reduce the levels of empty capsids in the product. The 
analytical methods and validation are adequately described. Given the limited batch data available, the 
active substance release specifications should be re-evaluated after ten further active substance 
batches are manufactured. The proposed shelf life for the active substance has been supported by real 
time data.  
The finished product contains a total of 2.8×1011 vector genome copies (vg) in 0.5 ml. The finished 
product is comprised of compendial excipients including potassium chloride, sodium chloride, 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, disodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, and 
poloxamer 188 in water for injections.  
A major objection was raised at Day 120 on the deficiencies in the comparability exercise, mainly due 
to the fact that data from only one Process A clinical batch and one Process B clinical batch were 
available. No further data is available for these batches due to sample depletion. It therefore remains 
uncertain whether the commercial batches have comparable biological activity and comparable levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 30/132 
 
 
 
of empty capsids compared to the clinical batches. As there are no more samples from Process A and B 
batches available, there is no further quality data which could be of use for decision making. Therefore, 
no further questions were raised from a quality perspective. The remaining uncertainty on 
comparability was considered acceptable in the context of the overall benefit/risk decision. 
Data from finished product PPQ batches have been provided and the proposal to use a concurrent 
validation approach for manufacture of an additional finished product PPQ batch is acceptable in 
principle. An Annex II condition was agreed in relation to the results of the next active substance and 
next finished product concurrent process validation batches, including hold time data for the finished 
product batch by March 2023.  
The proposed finished product specifications include relevant tests for identity, potency, purity and 
safety. Given the limited available batch data, it is also recommended to re-evaluate the acceptance 
criteria for finished product release after ten batches have been manufactured and revise them if 
necessary. 
An overview of the facility and process controls which may have a role in reduction or clearance of 
viruses and a viral risk assessment were provided.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation 
application for Upstaza is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Upstaza is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions as 
defined in the SmPC. The quality of the active substance and finished product is controlled by adequate 
test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured.  
The CAT has identified the following measure necessary to address the identified quality developments 
issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: 
In order to further assess process consistency and maintain patient’s safety, the applicant shall provide 
the results of the next active substance and next finished product concurrent process validation 
batches, including hold time data for the finished product batch. This data should be provided by March 
2023 (Annex II condition). 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above.  
The applicant agreed to the Recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT recommended some points for further investigation. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality 
development as mentioned above.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical pharmacology program for eladocagene exuparvovec consists of in vitro studies in 
human cells to characterize the expression and biological activity of eladocagene exuparvovec. Since 
reduced dopamine levels in the striatum is also the underlying pathophysiology in Parkinson’s disease, 
preclinical efficacy studies published with rAAV2-hAADC vectors in rat and non-human primate models 
of Parkinson’s disease are supportive of the eladocagene exuparvovec pharmacology program. In 
addition, a published nonclinical efficacy study in a mouse model of AADC deficiency using rAAV9-
hAADC is supportive towards proof of concept for human AADC gene therapy. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
AAV vectors are nonenveloped 25 nm particles with a foreign DNA packaging capacity of 4.6 kb. They 
have been clinically demonstrated to be safe in the CNS, and certain serotypes display strong neural 
tropism. Importantly for CNS gene therapy applications, AAV can transduce nondividing cells and has 
the ability to confer long-term stable gene expression without associated inflammation or toxicity. The 
AAV-delivered genome persists mostly as an extrachromosomal episome, but the approximately 1% of 
genomes that integrate in the target genome raises the hypothetical risk of insertional mutagenesis 
and oncogenesis. (Gray et al., 2010) 
Rationale Supporting the Selection of the Vector Serotype, Route of Administration, and 
Dose of Vector 
The use of AAV vectors has been clinically demonstrated to be safe in the CNS, and AAV2 has been 
studied extensively. AAV2 has neural tropism, and is the choice of the applicant, however AAV9 also 
has unique characteristics that would also make it an attractive choice for neuronal transduction, such 
as the ability to transduce more cells than AAV2 (Gray et al., 2010). The applicant does not discuss 
their choice relative to other AAV serotypes.  
The applicant has provided a justification for localised delivery to the putamen. In this justification they 
raise concerns regarding ectopic over expression of dopamine and serotonin. The amount of AADC 
enzyme would be considered to be the rate limiting step in the conversion of L-dopa to dopamine, 
therefore the dose is crucial to not result in overproduction of dopamine. 
The choice of localised delivery as opposed to global delivery is endorsed. Lee et al., 2014 clearly 
demonstrated that ICV administration resulted in widespread but asymmetric staining, and AAV9 AADC 
transduction following ICV injection does not mirror WT AADC staining, especially in the hippocampus 
and cortex. Staining in the substantia nigra was not observed. 
The applicant states that over expression of eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy outside of the 
putamen can result in excessive serotonin production.  Dopamine and serotonin are produced by 
distinct groups of neurons in the brain, and ectopic dopamine expression may be a concern, however 
the transduction of the serotoninergic neurons was not efficient. Biodistribution studies carried out by 
the applicant using iPut route of administration, demonstrated that in animals the highest transgene 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) concentrations were found in the key target therapeutic area, the 
putamen. The issue will not be pursued further, as using the clinical route of iPut administration, 
eladocagene exuparvovec is expressed primarily in the putamen and ectopic expression of dopamine 
and serotonin is unlikely. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 32/132 
 
 
 
Dopamine is normally synthesized and stored in the terminals of neurons that originate in the 
substantia nigra (SN) and project to the striatum (caudate and putamen). The SN is the source of a 
clinically important dopaminergic pathway to the striatum, i.e. dopamine released in the putamen 
originates in SN neurons. In PD treatment AADC is delivered directly to the putamen presumably as 
there is degradation of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. The pathophysiology of AADC 
deficiency is however different and these pathways appear to be unaffected (Lee et al., 2009). The 
applicant also states that infusions to the putamen did not have the same safety concerns as infusions 
to the substantia nigra and reference a study by Bartus et al., (2013), in fact the Bartus paper actually 
states that delivery to the SN and putamen was well tolerated with no safety complications identified 
over 2 years. Furthermore, it has been proposed that better efficacy could be achieved in AADC 
deficiency by infusing the SNpC as opposed to the putamen, as when infusion into the putamen is 
performed AAV-2-AADC transduces medium spiny neurons, and these cells do not synthesise 
appreciable amounts of L-Dopa, as opposed to the SnPC which does (San-Sebastian et al, 2014). 
Hadaczek et al., (2016) clearly demonstrated that targeted delivery of AAV1 or AAV2 to the striatum 
results in robust and global transduction of the striatum as well as many cortical regions via axonal 
transport. The applicant was asked to further justify the choice of putamen as injection site in AADC 
deficiency as opposed to the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the applicant was asked if targeting the 
putamen for delivery of eladocagene exuparvovec results in transduction of other brain structures 
beyond the striatum, and what are the implications of AADC expression in these locations.  
The applicant provided a discussion, three clinical studies have demonstrated that surgical injection of 
eladocagene exuparvovec to the putamen results in clinically meaningful improvement in motor and 
cognitive function in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) subjects and is well tolerated. In 
contrast, adeno-associated virus serotype 2 delivery to the substantia nigra (SN), a relatively small 
structure deep within the midbrain in proximity to critical neuronal and vascular structures, presents a 
practical problem for stereotactic navigation. Expression of the transgene outside of the striatum is 
expected to be limited with direct administration of AAV2 to the putamen. 
Other possible routes of administration that were explored in the planned juvenile toxicity studies, 
namely intrathecal/intra-cisternal and ICV administration Intraputaminal administration has the 
advantage of both achieving the highest transgene concentration and limiting non-specific distribution 
following administration. IT and ICV routes of administration possibly increase safety concerns, 
however, these routes of administration are more amenable to paediatric dosing. These three routes of 
administration were explored in a juvenile toxicity study (CRL 1144-023), a 4-week NHP biodistribution 
study to evaluate 3 routes of administration (RoA) including intraputaminal (iPut), 
intracerebroventricular (ICV), and intrathecal (IT)/intra-cisternal routes. Monkeys receiving vector via 
iPut administration yielded the highest levels of vector-derived gene expression (copies/10 ng RNA) in 
the putamen (1000 to 6000 copies), globus pallidus (4000 copies), and caudate (40 to 500 copies). In 
contrast, there was no expression in putamen or globus pallidus following ICV or IT administration, and 
no expression in the caudate following IT administration, with negligible expression (<45 copies) in the 
caudate following ICV administration. Unlike ICV and IT routes, following iPut dosing, there was no 
vector-derived gene expression at any level of the spinal cord and no expression in the dorsal root 
ganglia, greatly diminishing concern regarding this tissue of special toxicological interest for AAV-
related therapies. Therefore, based on the results of this study neither IT nor ICV routes appear 
feasible 
Doses used in models of Parkinson’s in NHPs were of the order of 1011 vg. FIH trials in PD utilised 9 x 
1010 and 3 x 1011 vg.  There are differences in the pathophysiology of these two diseases. A higher 
dose may be required in the complete absence of enzyme, as opposed to degeneration of neurons of 
the nigrostriatal pathway as occurs in PD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

The applicant has reasoned a child’s brain mass (1000g) is approximately 75% that of an adult 
(1350g) therefore at 60% of the PD trial dose this would equate to 1.8 x 1011 vg (the current proposed 
dose), however this is based on brain mass.  
The human brain is 13–18 times larger than the monkey brain. However, this ratio is significantly 
smaller for striatum (5.7–6.5), caudate nucleus (4.6–6.6) and putamen (4.4–6.6) (Yin et al., 2009). 
Hadaczek et al., (2010) measured the volume of AADC gene transduction from sequentially stained 
brain sections in two monkeys, 8 years after the original study, Bankiewicz et al., (2006). The volume 
of the infused (Vi) vector (6 × 30 µl, in one hemisphere) resulted in a volume of expression (Ve) of 
580 and 490 mm3 of the striatum. Although 35–40% of the striatal volume was transduced, only 5–6% 
of the neurons within this region expressed the AADC transgene, and only neurons were transduced by 
AAV2 in the brain. (Total dose 3.6 x 1011 vg, in one hemisphere). Considering the volume of the 
human striatum is ~5 times larger than the monkey striatum, this would require a larger dose to 
achieve transduction of the same volume. The proposed total dose for humans is 1.8 x 1011 vg, in a 
volume of 4 x 80μl. The applicant justified this dose on the basis that clinical studies in adult PD using 
rAAV2-hAADC reported that doses up to 3x 1011 vg of rAAV2-hAADC in a volume of 4×50 μl were well 
tolerated following bilateral, intraputaminal infusions during a single operative session. 1.8x1011 vg 
eladocagene exuparvovec for treatment of children with AADC deficiency was expected to improve 
AADC activity in the putamen based on the relative average brain mass of an adult brain (1350 g), 
compared to a child brain (1000 g), where the 1.8 x 1011 vg dose is approximately 60% of the highest 
dose tested in adult PD patients. Furthermore, the dose volume (4×80 μL) in the current study (AADC-
010) exceeded the dose volume (4×50 μL) in adult PD patients potentially enabling the transduction 
area in the current study to be larger than the transduction area of the adult PD patients. 
Primary Pharmacodynamics 
In primary pharmacodynamic studies, the applicant demonstrated expression of the AADC protein in 
HEK293 cells following transfection with eladocagene exuparvovec and determined the enzymatic 
activity of the AADC protein expressed. Expression from the vector was achieved however no loading 
control blot has been provided to demonstrate equal loading of protein, neither has the amount of 
protein per lane been stipulated. 
The applicant has transduced HEK293 cells, these cells are routinely used due to their ease of use. The 
applicant does not state duration of expression in these cells. No proof that neuronal cells can be 
transduced with rAAV2-hAADC and express the enzyme has been provided. The applicant was asked to 
justify the use of these cells. The applicant acknowledges that an in vitro demonstration of rAAV2-
hAADC transduction of neuronal cells has not been carried out, however positron emission tomography 
imaging from subjects dosed with eladocagene exuparvovec shows that dopamine is produced in the 
putamen indicating that rAAV2-hAADC transgene is expressed in neural cells in the putamen. HEK 293 
cells appear appropriate for the Potency assay due to permissibility of AAV2 transduction, and HEK293 
cells demonstrate no evident tissue-specific gene expression signature and express the markers for 
renal progenitor cells, neuronal cells and adrenal gland. 
The applicant has not carried out any in vivo pharmacology studies with eladocagene exuparvovec. 
However, multiple nonclinical studies in models of Parkinson’s disease involving CNS delivery of rAAV2-
hAADC, which are relevant to eladocagene exuparvovec, have been reported. These studies were 
generally conducted with rAAV2-hAADC containing the same capsid, promoter, and encoded protein as 
eladocagene exuparvovec and are therefore supportive information. In addition, the doses used in 
these published studies span the previous doses of rAAV2-hAADC reported in human studies and the 
clinical dose of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Subsequent to the applicant commencing clinical studies, Lee et al., generated a mouse model of AADC 
deficiency (Lee et al., 2013, 2014). They utilised an AAV9-AADC construct and transduced the brain 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 34/132 
 
 
 
using ICV, thereby not specifically targeting the putamen. They demonstrated widespread AADC 
expression in the mouse brain, with normalised DA levels, resolving motor symptoms, however ectopic 
DA expression was a concern, and transduction of serotonergic neurons was not efficient. Desired 
effect is in the striatum and/or putamen. In the brain, dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons also 
reside in the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal raphe nuclei, and other areas. AAV9 AADC transduction 
following ICV injection does not mirror WT AADC staining as visualised by immunohistochemistry. 
Sánchez-Pernaute et al., (2001) demonstrated that a single infusion of AAV2-AADC was sufficient to 
restore the decarboxylating capacity to 50% of normal striatal activity in 6-OHDA hemiparkinsonian 
rats. Thereby suggesting that it is possible to restore AADC activity to normal levels if the entire 
striatum is transduced. The applicant also described a study in rats by Shen et al., (2000) and similar 
studies in NHPs by Muramatsu et al., (2002) and Sehara et al., (2017), which utilised triple AAV 
treatment expressing (1) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) which catalyzes the synthesis of L-DOPA from 
tyrosine, (2) AADC, and (3) guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase I (GCH). In these studies it 
is difficult to appreciate the contribution of AADC as two other enzymes are co-expressed. 
In a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease, long-term clinical improvement after treatment 
with AAV2-hAADC was observed (Bankiewicz et al., 2006). 
No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted and this is acceptable due to the targeted delivery 
of the vector to the brain and its limited distribution outside the brain. 
Safety Pharmacology  
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were not conducted with eladocagene exuparvovec. An 
evaluation of CNS effects was included in the 6-month GLP toxicology study. No eladocagene 
exuparvovec related effects on CNS were observed during the FOB evaluation. No stand-alone 
respiratory or cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies were conducted. Clinical observations and 
FOB measurements did not indicate any effects on respiratory function. According to ICH S7A, it is 
sufficient to evaluate safety pharmacology endpoints as part of toxicology and pharmacology studies 
for biotechnology-derived products that achieve highly specific targeting (such as AAV vectors). 
Overall, eladocagene exuparvovec expresses the enzyme AADC, and expression of AADC appears to 
restore dopamine production. The provided non-clinical pharmacology package could be sufficient to 
support the marketing authorisation application AADC deficiency provided the other concerns can be 
adequately addressed. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of eladocagene exuparvovec was evaluated as part of a 6-month Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant toxicity and biodistribution study in rats. Supportive and relevant 
PK data with other recombinant adeno associate virus type-2-human aromatic l-amino acid 
decarboxylase (rAAV2-hAADC) vectors were also obtained from published literature. 
A series of analytical and bioanalytical methods were developed to support the eladocagene 
exuparvovec nonclinical program. Methods were appropriately validated and met applicable standards 
for performance. 
The standard ADME studies for conventional medicinal products are not typically relevant for GTMPs, 
and as such standard pharmacokinetic assessments were not conducted as part of the eladocagene 
exuparvovec gene therapy program. The distribution of eladocagene exuparvovec was evaluated as 
part of the nonclinical program in the 6-month GLP toxicity and biodistribution study in rats (Study 
8366537, AADC-003). Eladocagene exuparvovec was distributed to the CNS following bilateral infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 35/132 
 
 
 
 
to the putamen, with distribution primarily to the injection site. The AADC transgene was expressed 
throughout the entire duration of the study in rats. No evidence of shedding of the vector in blood or 
CSF fluid was observed. 
Protocol-specified reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were conducted 
as per protocol and conducted without deviation except for sample-related issues (eg, not collected, 
insufficient sample). 
Primer and probe sequences used in the qPCR and RT-qPCR were provided. The sequences for the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were designed based on their specificity for the human 
dopa decarboxylase (DDC) cDNA sequence. To ensure amplification of vector transgene and not 
genomic DNA, the forward and reverse primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries (Exons 
6 to 7 and Exons 7 to 8, respectively). Designed primers and probe were tested in 3 different 
commercial master mix preparations for the detection and quantification of the adeno-associated virus 
expressing the human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase gene plasmid. The primers and probes 
were analyzed in the presence of human and rat DNA to assess specificity. Additionally, the same 
primer and probe set was used to develop the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay 
and was tested in 2 different commercial master mixes. Rat and human liver ribonucleic acid were 
used as a specificity control. Both assays were validated in accordance with the ICH Q2 (R1). 
Expression of the DDC gene was measured by qPCR for vector DNA and RT-qPCR for mRNA expression. 
As expected, the presence of eladocagene exuparvovec DNA was confirmed in the putamen (the dose 
site) at all time points and dose groups and was at its highest level on Day 7 in high dose (7.5×109 vg) 
animals. However, different volumes of the vector were administered to each group, 0.5 (low dose) – 5 
μl (high dose).  In calculations provided, the dose-normalized (vg/μg DNA/vg dose) biodistribution at 
the dose site was equivalent between the high dose and low dose at Day 7 (4.56x104 versus 
4.57x104/μg DNA/vg), thereby suggesting that the volume of the dose did not affect the volume of 
distribution 1 week after dosing. In addition, the high dose and vehicle had the same dose volume of 5 
μL. Since there were no toxicologically significant findings at the high dose, the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was set at the high dose (7.5x109 vg). Based on these data, the dosing volume 
was determined to have no impact on the NOAEL. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec DNA was detected in control animals and not detected in some Group 3 
animals. More DNA copies were detected in lumbar and thoracic spinal cord in control group than in 
Group 2. The results suggest that differences between groups represent biological variation of vector 
distribution combined with dose. Even at the high dose (Group 4) there were 2 samples <LLOQ, 3 
samples <200 copies, and 1 sample <800 copies, while the remaining 6 (of 12 samples) varied from 
5000 to 23000 copies. The applicant states that this was due to cleaning procedures which were not 
sufficient to remove the vector from the fixed needle syringes used in the bioanalytical procedure. The 
applicant has further clarified that the issues detected and investigated with respect to insufficient 
cleaning were not a result of the syringes used for dosing, but instead those used for quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The Hamilton syringes used for dose administration were distinct 
from the fixed-needle syringes utilized during qPCR. Therefore no mis-dosing occurred. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec distributed primarily to the CNS but distribution to other tissues cannot be 
excluded based on the non-clinical data. The applicant was therefore asked to provide a discussion on 
whether the non-target expression may pose safety concerns. The rat biodistribution/toxicity study 
(AADC-003) resulted in no evidence of consistent transgene presence in the periphery either in blood 
(as a transgene transport mechanism) or in peripheral non-neural tissues. Even within the CNS in 
which distribution occurred (eg, cerebellum and spinal cord), the expression of transgene was minimal 
to mild even at the highest dose level. The strongest transgene levels were observed in the putamen, 
the target tissue. It is considered, given negative/negligible vector presence in rat blood and CSF by 
Assessment report

Day 7, combined with both low vector presence/transfection within nontarget CNS tissue at Day 7, to 
be a low probability that a therapeutic dose of eladocagene exuparvovec in human subjects would 
result in either peripheral tissue distribution of vector or of any transgene expression. 
The applicant has also submitted two new PK-studies for biodistribution in cynomolgus (#1144-015 
and #1144-023). In the first study (#1144-015), there was an assessment of the distribution of rAAV-
eGFP (+/- 0.001% poloxamer 188 [P188]) from a single bilateral intra-putamen injection in 
cynomolgus monkeys. In the second cynomolgus study (#1144-023), the CNS distribution was 
assessed for rAAV2-hAADC from a single bilateral intra-putamen (BIP), intracerebroventricular (ICV), 
or intrathecal (IT; lumbar puncture) injection in cynomolgus monkeys. Considering the limited number 
of animals in the experimental groups, and the extensive inter-individual difference in vector copy 
levels, it is difficult to draw strong generalized conclusions beyond noting that the inter-putamen route 
seems most feasible to introduce high levels of the transgene into the putamen (compared to the ICV 
and IT routes). There were no signs of vector or poloxamer 188 mediated toxicity beyond the damage 
caused by the injection procedure into the neural tissues. That being said, one cannot dismiss the 
possibility that the transgene will spread to adjacent brain regions (e.g. globus pallidus, caudate, 
amygdala) at least in some individuals. The consequences of this spread are not clear but there were 
no alarming clinical signs detected in cynomolgus in the present studies. 
The applicant argues that non-target expression of eladocagene exuparvovec DNA in the periphery 
would likely be limited by normal physiological control mechanisms and would not be considered to 
pose a safety concern. This may or may not be true (especially considering the near putamen levels of 
the transgene in some brain regions). The applicant also notes that there may be a pharmacological 
approach to handle to high AADC levels if needed. It is noted that Carbidopa is a peripherally acting 
decarboxylase inhibitor, which prevents AADC activity systemically and thus increases central efficacy. 
Thus, theoretically, excessive non-target expression of eladocagene exuparvovec DNA that presumably 
increases AADC activity to a non-physiological level, could be safely treated with carbidopa and thus 
minimize any potential safety concerns. 
The applicant also described a biodistribution study by Cunningham et al., (2008), where 
biodistribution of AAV2-hAADC was assessed over a wide range of vector dose in 12 monkeys with 
parkinsonian syndrome, 6 months after intraputamenal infusion. Biodistribution of rAAV2-hAADC in 
brain and peripheral tissues was assessed which demonstrated that total copies of vector DNA 
increased in the brain in a roughly dose-dependent manner. Biodistribution was also assessed in eight 
peripheral organs, in the serum, and in the CSF to determine whether AAV2-hAADC delivered to the 
brain can spread to non-neuronal tissues. No vector DNA was detected in fluids or tissues, other than 
trace amounts in spleen in the two highest-dose groups, 3.4 x 1011 vg/brain and 1 x 1012 vg/brain. 
The applicant is relying on publications from the Bankiewicz group as supporting information, however 
there appear to be differences in their methodology. In Cunningham et al., (2008), AAV2-hAADC was 
infused bilaterally at four sites (2/hemisphere) into postcommissural PT at the following rates: 0.1 
μl/min (10 minutes), 0.2 μl/min (10 minutes), 0.5 μl/min (10 minutes), 0.8 μl/min (10 minutes), and 
1.0 μl/min (36 minutes) The applicant in their study 8366537 describes their rate of infusion as 0.5 
µl/min. Furthermore, the applicant uses different volumes for each of their groups from 0.5 µl to 5 µl, 
Cunningham used a consistent volume at each infusion site. The applicant provided a discussion 
arguing that differences in infusion rates or volumes appears to have minimal differences on final 
distribution. Distribution of vector is largely a function of the vector ‘spread’ within the target area at 
the time of infusion of the liquid volume coupled with subsequent secondary movement of vector, both 
within and beyond the target area via additional processes (eg, diffusion, active transport). The ‘initial 
spread’ of vector is in part a function of hydrodynamics during infusion, along with biological aspects, 
such as vector adhesion and uptake into cells; a smaller volume (eg, 0.5 μL) would likely result in 
smaller initial target area ‘spread’ than a larger volume (eg, 5 μL). However, this would not affect 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 37/132 
 
 
 
secondary vector distribution, which would be a function of local vector concentration and therefore of 
vector dose.  
Overall, biodistribution of eladocagene exuparvovec is mostly confined to the CNS following bilateral 
infusion to the putamen. The applicant has provided new studies, in response to the D120 LoQ, in 
cynomolgus and a discussion on the potential safety concerns. While there is some spread to adjacent 
brain regions, there are no indications of vector/transgene or poloxamer 188 related toxicity. While the 
argument for normal physiological control of excessive levels of transgene expression in non-target 
tissues is very speculative, the long-term San Sebastian study seems to support a non-toxicity profile 
(at least for 9 months) and the carbidopa hypothesis seems a testable option.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety program conducted to characterize the toxicity and biodistribution of 
eladocagene exuparvovec comprised of two studies, a 30-day study, and a 6 month study, both in 
rats. Additional published toxicity and biodistribution studies in nonhuman primates with rAAV2-AADC 
using the same AAV2 capsid, promoter and human dopa decarboxylase (DDC) gene provided 
supportive toxicity data for the safety assessment of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Comparability of the clinical lots 2004-101 and PBR-0045- 001 to lots made using the intended 
commercial process was provided. It is clear that in the initial submission no nonclinical studies had 
been carried out using the intended commercial formulation. Furthermore, the commercial formulation 
contains 0.001% poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F68). The applicant claims that based a study carried out by 
San-Sebastian et al., (2014) that the administration of 0.001% pluronic to the brain is safe. However, 
San-Sebastian (2014) transduced the substantia nigra pars compacta and the VTA, not the putamen., 
The total volume transduced to these areas was 60 μl, the proposed dose volume in humans is 320 μl. 
At an absolute level this is ~5 times less than that proposed for injection into human. A toxicological 
assessment of Poloxamer 188 injected into the brain was requested and provided in response.  
Toxicological Assessment of Poloxamer 188 (P188) 
The applicant carried out two new nonclinical studies, one in rat, and one in NHP, in support of the use 
of P188; 
• 
Poloxamer 188: Single Dose Toxicity Study in Rats via Bilateral intra Putaminal Injection 
(Study 8446039, GLP).  
•  A non-GLP Safety and Biodistribution Study of rAAV-eGFP With and Without Poloxamer 
Following Intra-putaminal Infusion in the Non-Human Primate (Study AADC-2020-005, CRL 
1144-015) 
In addition, the applicant provided a literature-based risk/toxicity assessment. 
• 
Poloxamer 188: Single Dose Toxicity Study in Rats via Bilateral intra Putaminal Injection 
(Study 8446039, GLP) 
This study was intended to evaluate the safety of P188 in rats at 0.003% and 0.010% concentrations 
administered once via bilateral intracranial injection into the putamen. 
No P188-related mortality occurred. There were no adverse effects on clinical observations, FOB, 
ophthalmic exam, body weight or body weight gain, food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology, 
clinical chemistry), organ weights, macroscopic observations, or microscopic examination 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 38/132 
 
 
 
The NOAEL for P188 was 0.010% (w/v). Based on the concentration of P188 (0.010%) and dose 
volume of administration (5 μL/side), this NOAEL value is equivalent to a dose of 0.5 μg/side of P188 
or 1 μg total per animal. 
•  A non-GLP Safety and Biodistribution Study of rAAV-eGFP With and Without Poloxamer 
Following Intra-putaminal Infusion in the Non-Human Primate (Study AADC-2020-005, CRL 
1144-015) 
This study was intended to evaluate distribution of a recombinant AAV2-delivered reporter gene (green 
fluorescent protein gene [GFP]) in absence or presence of 0.001% P188, as well as evaluate dose 
responsiveness in presence of 0.001% P188. The recombinant adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 
(rAAV2) vector was identical to that used for eladocagene exuparvovec and this study also evaluated 
limited toxicological parameters. 
The biodistribution of the recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-enhanced GFP was evaluated 
following a single intraputaminal infusion in monkeys. Intraputaminal injection was performed at a rate 
of 5 μL/minute. The following parameters and endpoints were evaluated in this study: mortality, 
detailed clinical signs, body weights, clinical pathology parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry), 
bioanalysis (anti-drug antibody [ADA], cerebral spinal fluid [CSF] biodistribution), gross necropsy 
findings, histopathologic examination, and tissue biodistribution. 
There was no effect due to the presence of 0.001% P188 in the dosing formulation (compared to 
Control also with P188 or to the active comparator without P188) on procedure-related (infusion 
needle) brain parenchymal microscopic findings, or anti-AAV2 antibody levels, or rAAV2-GFP dose-
responsive vector biodistribution. Additionally, there were no effects in this study (with or without 
P188) on mortality, detailed clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology 
parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry), gross necropsy findings, histopathologic examination. 
The biodistribution results from the tissues analysed revealed a general biodistribution pattern 
although variability was observed. Despite such variation, overall, the highest concentrations of GFP 
viral vector at Day 8 were consistently detected in the putamen (dorsal/ventral) and globus pallidus. 
Vector levels in these regions were dose responsive and durable (lasting to Day 30).  
Poloxamer 188 Risk Analysis 
The inclusion of P188 in pharmaceutical formulations is not novel. As of 2020, P188 has been approved 
by FDA as an inactive ingredient in 21 marketed products. Due to its amphiphilic chemical properties, 
P188 has beneficial manufacturing properties (surfactant, dispersing agent, prevention of vector 
aggregation) necessary for production of a quality drug product, and potential beneficial 
pharmaceutical properties (reduction of trauma-induced inflammation/damage of neuronal tissue) 
(Patel 2009).  
Pharmacokinetic and metabolism data from both animals and humans provide valuable insight into 
these general topics from which reasonable extrapolations can be made regarding likely events and 
safety in the brain parenchyma. It is reasonable to conclude the following regarding P188 in the 
putamen: 
1.  It is primarily distributed in extracellular fluid and does not bind to membrane extracellular 
surfaces, likely including neuronal tissue (Grindel 2002). 
2.  It is freely diffusible in the extracellular compartment and rapidly equilibrates between CSF and 
other body fluids (lymph, interstitial fluid, blood) (Willcox 1978). 
3.  It is expected to redistribute from brain to blood circulation as mostly free/unbound P188 
(Willcox 1978). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 39/132 
 
 
 
4.  It is likely not metabolised in the brain since whole body clearance (half-life in humans of 7 to 
8 hours) is primarily via renal mechanisms without metabolism (Grindel 2002). 
5.  Tissue distribution of P188 in animals suggests an approximate ratio of 10:1 for plasma to- 
brain P188 levels (Willcox 1978). 
6.  based on animal data for tissue and brain partitioning, the estimated human brain Cmax could 
be as high as 73 μg/mL (or 73 μg/g brain weight based on partitioning to the brain at 8% of 
the plasma value). 
The absolute amount of intraputaminally administered P188 in the rat GLP toxicity study at the NOAEL 
of 0.010% P188 is equal to 1 μg P188 total. 
In the proposed clinical formulation of 0.001% P188, dosed in a volume of 320 μl, the total amount of 
P188 administered is 3.2 μg. In comparison to the rat dose of 1 μg P188 per 2 g brain = 500 ng/g, this 
provides a margin of 156 for a child’s brain (1000g) and 210 for an adult brain (1350 g). 
Single dose toxicity 
Two single-dose studies were conducted to assess toxicity at 30-days and 6 months. The 30-day 
toxicology study evaluated the potential toxicity of eladocagene exuparvovec in rats following a single 
direct injection into the putamen at dose levels of 0, 3×109, and 7.5×109 vg or into the substantia 
nigra at a dose level of 1.5×109 vg. The study was conducted in support of clinical development, and 
infusions to both putamen and substantia nigra were explored as potential routes of administration. 
Both routes were shown to be well tolerated. 
In the 6-month study a single eladocagene exuparvovec administration via bilateral IPI at doses up to 
7.5×109 vg was generally well tolerated with no obvious signs of toxicity. Based on the study results, 
the highest dose administered (7.5×109 vg) in the study provides a safety margin of 21 over the 
human dose used in clinical studies, as calculated by the applicant. The dose is chosen based on vector 
genomes (vg) per gram of brain weight, since eladocagene exuparvovec is injected directly into brain 
tissue [average brain weights: 2 g (rats) and 1,000 g (child)]. Based on brain weight the ratio of 
human:rat is 500:1, however based on structure volume an adult putamen = 3.5 cm3 (Yin et al., 
2009) and rat striatum = 0.045cm3 (Andersson et al., 2002), an approximate ratio is 77:1. Other 
studies referenced in the dossier calculate dose based on volume of the structure targeted (San-
Sebastian, 2012 and 2014). Due to large differences in brain volume, and limited diffusion/ active 
transport of vector, the applicant was asked to discuss if this is appropriate method of scaling. The 
applicant referenced three papers in support of their approach, these papers describe volumetric errors 
with respect to stereotactic surgical procedures where accuracy and precision are essential. Yin et al 
(2009) state they have taken these very concerns into account and while absolute volume data can be 
affected by error, the volumetric ratios between NHP and humans would remain valid. The calculations 
provided by the applicant have demonstrated more conservative safety margins when calcuations are 
based on structural volume. Sufficient acceptable margins are still achieved using this method of 
calculation. 
Blood samples were collected for anti-drug antibody (ADA) evaluation against the vector capsid. The 
formation of anti-drug antibodies against the AAV2 vector capsid was dose dependent with the highest 
incidence observed in Group 4 high-dose animals at Days 30 and 180. Anti-drug antibodies were not 
evaluated against the transgene product, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) at the time of 
the study because an antibody assay against AADC was not available at that time. The product was 
reported in the sub-report submitted on 18 October 2018, which shows that the presence of anti-drug 
antibodies had no effect on the biodistribution or expression.

Eladocagene exuparvovec is a single dose gene therapy with persistent gene expression through 6 
months in rodents (Leidos 8366537, AADC-003) which provides chronic exposure and, therefore, no 
repeat-dose studies were conducted. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
It was previously agreed with CHMP that genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and evaluation of insertional 
mutagenesis studies were not required (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/236092/2018). The applicant has provided 
a discussion on the risk of insertional mutagenesis and carcinogenic potential. Based on the weight of 
evidence discussed regarding episomal AAV2 vector biology, integration sites, clinical experience with 
recombinant AAV2 vectors, the lack of any histologic or clinical evidence for tumor formation in 
eladocagene exuparvovec or rAAV2-AADC chronic toxicology studies in rats, carried out by the 
applicant, and supportive data from nonhuman primates, there appears to be a low risk for genomic 
integration or tumorigenicity in post-mitotic neuronal cells. Thus, the risks for DNA insertions and 
deletions are similar to spontaneous rates observed in normal cells. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No specific developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were conducted by the applicant with 
eladocagene exuparvovec, in agreement with CHMP. Given the local administration of eladocagene 
exuparvovec to the brain and lack of systemic exposure, and the absence of biodistribution to the 
gonads, the risk for germline transmission is low.  
Juvenile toxicity 
The applicant has agreed a paediatric investigation plan and been granted a deferral for recombinant 
adeno-associated viral vector serotype 2 carrying the gene for the human aromatic L-amino acid 
decarboxylase protein (EMEA-002435-PIP01-18) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council. Two further nonclinical studies are planned to determine 
the biodistribution and toxicity of eladocagene exuparvovec in Cynomolgus monkeys. An update was 
requested in the D120 LoQ regarding the timelines of these studies.  
The first of these two studies (CRL 1144-023) in juvenile monkeys is now complete; final study report 
dated 31 August 2020, and was submitted with the D120 responses, in response to Q160. Based on 
the data obtained in the initial RoA study demonstrating superior expression in the target putamen 
region with iPut administration despite using a 10-fold lower dose as compared to ICV and IT 
administration, a waiver (EMEA-002435-PIP01-18-M02 [eladocagene exuparvovec]) for the second 
study was submitted to PDCO and accepted 16 December 2020.

In the initial biodistribution study (CRL 1144-023), the iPut group was dosed at 1.2x 1010 vg. The 
doses in both the ICV and IT dose groups were increased 10-fold (to 1.2x 1011 vg) to potentially 
achieve a comparable distribution to target brain nuclei as that attained via the iPut route, given the 
assumed greater biodistribution of vector via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these 2 routes. 
The 1.2x 1010 vg dose for iPut administration was selected to represent a pharmacologically active 
dose (PAD) in monkey and determined via a brain weight scaling of a clinical human dose of 1.8x1011 
vg (as per Studies AADC-010 and AADC-011 [for subjects >3 years old]). Dose scaling was based on 
brain weight. Similar dose scaling results was demonstrated based on putamen volume. 
Overall, bilateral intra-putaminal, unilateral intracerebroventricular, or intrathecal dosing was well 
tolerated. All animals received a full dose of test article.

Animals receiving the rAAV2-hAADC viral vector via intra-putamen dose yielded the highest levels of 
vector derived gene expression in the putamen, caudate, and globus pallidus as compared to either the 
ICV or IT lumbar puncture routes of administration for which there was generally no (BLOD) 
expression.  
Unlike ICV and IT dosing, the intra-putamen route produced no detectable vector in blood. All three 
routes of administration resulted in comparable CSF vector concentrations, though the ICV route 
trended higher than both IT and intra-putamen routes. 
The concentration of the rAAV2-hAADC viral vector in the blood and CSF between the Day 2 timepoint 
and the Prior to Necropsy collections decreased in all animals with the exception of the Group 2 Animal 
Number 2002M. In this animal, the concentrations of the vector increased between the 2 intervals with 
the Prior to Necropsy sample being significantly higher than all other animals. Group 1 exhibited no 
(i.e., BLOD) vector in the blood on either Day 2 or at necropsy. In contrast, both Groups 2 and 3 
exhibited detectable vector (up to 757 and 1513 copies/μg DNA, respectively) on Day 2 in blood, which 
decreased to none (BLOD) by necropsy. With regards to CSF vector (copies/μg DNA), all 3 routes of 
administration resulted in slight to moderate levels of vector on Day 2 with a range of values: 314-
33838 copies (Group 1), 29483-58560 copies (Group 2), and 224-57531 copies (Group 3). Based on 
group mean values the rank order of CSF vector was ICV (42293 copies) > IT (18186 copies) > intra-
putamen (11235 copies). 
ICV administration resulted in mild to moderate (< 100000) copies in the caudate, though with 
maximum levels still less than that attained via intra-putamen administration. Vector concentration 
(copies/μg DNA) attained in the caudate following ICV administration ranged from 1752-48811 copies 
(c.f. intra-putamen range up to 437897 copies). 
Vector copy number detected in all target areas following IT administration were significantly less than 
those attained following intra-putamen dosing. 
The monkeys in this study were approx. 1.5 year old. 2 year old monkeys cover 5-12 year old humans. 
A 6 month old monkey is the developmental equivalent of a 2 year old human child, and ethically the 
youngest age monkeys can be used in studies is 10 months.  It is therefore acknowledged that studies 
in pre-weaning NHPs are difficult to perform.  
The applicant was asked to clarify if the brain weight of these young monkeys (~1.5 year old) is similar 
to that of 74g quoted by Pardo et al., (2012) for 2.5-5 year old monkeys. The applicant confirmed that 
the brain weight of the monkeys used was similar to those referenced in Pardo et al., (2012). 
Maximum brain weight appears to be achieved by approximately 3 months of age in monkeys 
(Sakamoto et al., 2014). 
Overall, in the toxicity studies eladocagene exuparvovec was generally well tolerated with no obvious 
signs of toxicity.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The evaluation of Environmental Risk Assessment was conducted in consultation with national bodies 
responsible for release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is a replication-incompetent virus derived from AAV2. The genetic 
modifications do not affect its natural host and tissue tropism. Eladocagene exuparvovec is unable to 
replicate independently, even in the presence of a helper virus, since it lacks the REP and CAP genes 
required for rescue/packaging. None of the genetic modifications made to wild-type AAV2 during 
construction of eladocagene exuparvovec would be expected to enable the transfer or maintenance of

genetic material into the environment (outside its obligate host species), or have an effect on 
sensitivity to inactivating agents or survivability in the environment. 
Taking into account the data of follow-up for 10 years in a study of dogs treated with AAVs (Giang N. 
Nguyen, BS et al., Blood (2019) 134 (Supplement_1): 611), it is concluded that there is a greater risk 
of integration in the genome than previously assumed and it would advisable to increase the follow-up 
time of the patients. The applicant plans a long-term PAES study PTC-AADC-MA-407, for a minimum of 
10 years following gene therapy. There are two additional post authorisation studies planned. A long-
term natural history study PTC-AADC-MA-406, to document the natural history of the disease, and the 
final post authorisation study planned is the completion of the ongoing long term follow-up study 
(AADC-1602) of subjects treated in the clinical trial programme. Subjects will be followed up for 10 
years. 
Based on the nature of the GMO, the parental organism and the receiving environment, the deliberate 
release of eladocagene exuparvovec is not anticipated to have any potential for direct effects on the 
environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical pharmacology program for eladocagene exuparvovec consists of in vitro studies in 
human cells to characterize the expression and biological activity of eladocagene exuparvovec. The 
applicant carried out these studies using HEK293 cells and not neuronal cells, however HEK cells 
express markers for renal progenitor cells, neuronal cells and adrenal gland. No in vivo pharmacology 
studies were carried out in support of this application, and this is acceptable. The applicant refers to 
studies published in the literature as supportive information. 
The applicant provided a rationale in support of the selection of vector serotype, route of 
administration and dose of vector.  Using the clinical route of intra-putamen (iPut) administration, 
eladocagene exuparvovec is expressed primarily in the putamen and ectopic expression of dopamine 
and serotonin is unlikely. The putamen is the preferred target, rather than the substantia nigra. 
Expression of the transgene outside of the striatum is expected to be limited with direct administration 
of AAV2 to the putamen. Intraputaminal administration has the advantage of both achieving the 
highest transgene concentration and limiting non-specific distribution following administration. IT and 
ICV routes of administration possibly increase safety concerns, however, these routes of administration 
are more amenable to paediatric dosing. However based on the results from a juvenile animal study 
exploring these alternative RoA, neither ICV nor IT routes appear feasible due to low vector copy 
number detected in the target area following administration via these routes. Stand-alone safety 
pharmacology studies were not conducted with eladocagene exuparvovec. An evaluation of CNS effects 
was included in the 6-month GLP toxicology study.  
The distribution of eladocagene exuparvovec was evaluated as part of a 6-month Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP)-compliant toxicity and biodistribution study in rats. Eladocagene exuparvovec was 
distributed to the CNS following bilateral infusion to the putamen, with distribution primarily to the 
injection site. The AADC transgene was expressed throughout the entire duration of the study in rats. 
No evidence of shedding of the vector in blood or CSF fluid was obtained. 
Primer and probe sequences used in the qPCR and RT-qPCR are given. Sequences for the quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction assay were designed based on their specificity for the human dopa 
decarboxylase (DDC) cDNA sequence. To ensure amplification of vector transgene and not genomic 
DNA, the forward and reverse primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 43/132 
 
 
 
Eladocagene exuparvovec DNA was detected in other tissues apart from the CNS. The non-CNS tissues 
evaluated via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on Day 7 showed vector levels up to 300 
copies/μg DNA Mean tissue vector copy values <1000 copies/μg DNA represent biodistribution that is 
negligible and/or artifactual. As expected, the presence of eladocagene exuparvovec DNA was 
confirmed in the putamen (the dose site) at all time points and dose groups and was at its highest 
level on Day 7 in high dose (7.5×109 vg) animals. Different dosing volumes did not result in different 
distribution patterns. Eladocagene exuparvovec is distributed primarily to the CNS but distribution to 
other tissues cannot be excluded based on the non-clinical data. Distribution studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys demonstrated some spread to adjacent brain regions, however there were no indications of 
toxicity from either the transgene or the excipient poloxamer 188. No evidence of shedding of the 
vector in blood or CSF fluid was obtained. Supportive and relevant PK data with other recombinant 
adeno associate virus type-2-human aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (rAAV2-hAADC) vectors 
were also obtained from published literature. 
The nonclinical safety program conducted to characterize the toxicity and biodistribution of 
eladocagene exuparvovec comprised of two studies, a 30-day study, and a 6 month study, both in 
rats. Additional published toxicity and biodistribution studies in nonhuman primates with rAAV2-AADC 
using the same AAV2 capsid, promoter and human dopa decarboxylase (DDC) gene provided 
supportive toxicity data for the safety assessment of eladocagene exuparvovec.  
Two new non-clinical studies were carried out to characterise the administration of the Poloxamer 188 
excipient to the putamen of rats and monkeys. No toxicity concerns arose in these studies regarding 
poloxamer 188. 
In the studies carried out eladocagene exuparvovec was generally well tolerated with no obvious signs 
of toxicity. Anti-drug antibodies were evaluated against the vector capsid. Anti-drug antibodies were 
not evaluated against the transgene product, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) at the time 
of the study because an antibody assay against AADC was not available at that time. The presence of 
anti-drug antibodies had no effect on the biodistribution or expression Studies evaluating genotoxicity 
and carcinogenicity were not carried out, in agreement with CHMP. The applicant has provided a 
discussion on the risk of insertional mutagenesis and carcinogenic potential. Based on the weight of 
evidence discussed there appears to be a low risk for genomic integration or tumorigenicity in post-
mitotic neuronal cells. 
No specific developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were conducted by the applicant with 
eladocagene exuparvovec, in agreement with CHMP. Given the local administration of eladocagene 
exuparvovec to the brain and lack of systemic exposure, and the absence of biodistribution to the 
gonads, the risk for germline transmission is low.  
Two further nonclinical studies are planned to determine the biodistribution and toxicity of eladocagene 
exuparvovec  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys,  in  line  with  the  proposed  PIP.  Two  alternate  routes  of 
administration  (RoA),  besides  intraputaminal  (iPut),  were  evaluated  in  an  initial  biodistribution  study, 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intrathecal (IT). Based on the data obtained in the initial RoA study 
demonstrating superior expression in the target putamen region with iPut administration despite using 
a 10-fold lower dose as compared to ICV and IT administration, a waiver (EMEA-002435-PIP01-18-M02 
[eladocagene  exuparvovec])  for  a  second  study  was  submitted  to  PDCO  and  accepted  16  December 
2020.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Three clinical trials are submitted in support of this MAA. 
The first trial AADCCU-1601 is complete. Efficacy data for the primary efficacy endpoint at 24 months is 
presented  for  this  trial,  as  is  follow-up  data  on  subjects  to  60  months  post-treatment.  Eight  subjects 
took part in this trial. This trial started as a compassionate use access programme. 
In  the  second  trial  AADC-010,  ten  subjects  were  treated  and  data  for  the  assessment  of  the  primary 
efficacy  endpoint  at  24  months  is  available  on  all  subjects.  The  trial  is  ongoing  and  follow-up  for  60 
months is not completed on all subjects to date.  
Efficacy Data at 12 months is available from the 8 subjects treated in AADC-011. Five subjects in this 
trial  were  treated  with  a  30%  higher  dose.  This  was  because  of  elimination  of  a  dilution  step  in  the 
preparation  of  the  active  for  administration.  This  trial  is  still  ongoing.  This  data  is  not  included  in  the 
assessment  of  the  primary  endpoint  at  24  months.  Data  from  the  trial  is  presented  in  support  of  the 
MAA. Further efficacy & safety data on subjects treated in this trial should be available and presented as 
requested in the day 121 responses.

No dedicated clinical PK studies were conducted.   
Bioanalytical Methods 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used for screening of anti-AAV2 
antibodies in human serum using a commercially available kit. Anti-AAV2 antibodies in diluted serum 
sample bind to the AAV-2 particles coated onto a microtitre plate. With this commercial kit, the AAV2 
particles are produced in HEK 293 cells transfected with 3 plasmids containing the AAV-2 rep and cap 
genes, the adenovirus genome and a β-galactosidase expression cassette. The optical density (OD) 
cut-off used to assign positive samples is based on a research paper where samples with a value 
greater than the 0.5 OD were also positive for neutralising antibodies to β-galactosidase. It is not 
considered relevant to extrapolate data from the Ito et al study as it has not been shown that 
neutralisation of β-galactosidase correlates with positive ADAs against eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Furthermore, antibody titres were estimated by extrapolation of OD values from the Ito et al paper, 
which is also not agreed to.  
During the course of the evaluation, the applicant was requested to present validation results from a 
new anti AAV2 antibody assay and an anti AADC assay and the issue remained at day 170. In the 
response to the day 170 list of issues, method validation is presented for two new assays to anti-AAV2 
antibodies and neutralising anti-AAV2 antibodies. The approach for development of assay cut points is 
generally acceptable although the use of serum from patients with advanced metastatic tumours to 
determine the cut points for the total anti-AAV2 method should be justified. In general, the methods 
Assessment report

have been appropriately validated in line with the EMA guideline for bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2) addressing sensitivity, intra- and inter- assay 
precision, matrix selectivity, hook effect, specificity and sample stability. Drug tolerance data is 
presented for the total anti-AAV2 method but has been omitted for the neutralising antibody method 
and this data is requested.  
The total and neutralising anti-AAV2 antibody assays were used to analyse samples for subjects 
enrolled in the eladocagene exuparvovec clinical trial AADC-011 who were either treated with 
1.8×1011 vg (low dose group) or 2.4×1011 vg (high dose group). For the total antibody assay, 
samples were first screened (screening tier) for being positive for total anti-AAV2 antibody. If found 
positive, they were re-assayed (confirmatory tier), and if confirmed, the titre of samples was 
subsequently determined. A sample was determined negative for the total anti-AAV2 antibody assay if 
antibodies were not detected at the minimum required dilution of 1:50. Across the five subjects 
tested, an increase in total antibody titre was observed following administration of gene therapy. In 
general, the titre was either maintained or decreased over 12 months. The 2 patients treated with the 
higher dose of 2.4×1011 vg showed higher titres of total anti-AAV2 antibody than those of the lower 
dose group. A sample was determined negative for neutralising anti-AAV2 antibody assay if antibodies 
were not detected at the minimum required dilution of 1:20. After treatment, the levels of nAbs 
transiently increased and, in all cases, decreased by Month 12. Overall, the results are consistent with 
the results presented from the original ELISA method with the exception of subject AADC-307 who at 
baseline was positive for total anti-AAV but negative for neutralising antibodies and subject AADC-301 
who maintains positive nAB status up to 12 months according to the updated assay method.  
While the method validation is generally acceptable, it is noted that pre-screening samples from 
patients have not be re-analysed using the updated methods. Data is provided from baseline (visit 2) 
onwards only. The pre-screening samples for subjects included in trial AADC-011 should be re-
analysed using the new anti-AAV2 and neutralising assays in order to justify the threshold criteria for 
exclusion of patients from treatment (defined in SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8) or the applicant should 
otherwise justify how the cut off of “>1:20” is justified.  
A method for detection of anti-AADC antibodies is under development but has not yet been validated. 
The validation protocol presented for the method is generally acceptable.  
PTC plans to monitor levels of anti-AAV2 and anti-AADC antibodies from subjects in the proposed 
patient registry study.  
A real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to quantify AAV2-hAADC in blood and 
urine. An overview of the PCR procedure has been provided including reaction components, cycle 
conditions and primer sequences. Linearised p-AAV2-hAADC plasmid DNA was used to prepare 
standard curves and QC samples. Patient DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and urine. A 
sample was classified as positive for vector genomes if there were ≥100 copies in 250 ng of DNA. 
Details of method validation have been provided and are acceptable.  
A HPLC method was used to detect5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 3-methoxytyrosine (3MT, also 
known as 3OMD) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in human CSF samples. The method was initially 
described in a 1992 paper from Hyland et al. paper. A validation report has been provided from the 
testing site demonstrating linearity, precision, accuracy, stability and matrix effects. The assay can be 
considered acceptable for testing HVA, 5-HIAA, and 3MT. 
Viral shedding assessment 
The risk of eladocagene exuparvovec viral vector shedding was evaluated in each clinical study via a 
real time-polymerase chain reaction method. Eladocagene exuparvovec viral vector was not detected 
in any patient’s blood or urine samples prior to or up to 12 months post-surgery in all clinical studies.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is a sterile, parenteral formulation gene therapy indicated for the treatment 
of patients with AADC deficiency. Eladocagene exuparvovec contains the active biological substance 
rAAV2-hAADC (a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 [rAAV2] vector containing the human 
DDC gene and coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cDNA) that encodes the human aromatic L-amino 
acid decarboxylase [hAADC]) and compendial excipients. After injection into the putamen, the product 
results in the expression of the AADC enzyme resulting in production of dopamine, and consequently, 
restoration of motor function in AADC deficient patients. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Measurement of putaminal-specific uptake 
Expression and activity of the AADC enzyme in the putamen was assessed by PET imaging using 18F-
DOPA, a positron-emitting fluorine-labelled version of levodopa, which is a substrate for AADC. The 
18F-DOPA is administered intravenously, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is taken up by the pre-
synaptic nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons in the putamen and converted by AADC to dopamine. 
Therefore, increased 18F-DOPA putamen uptake over time objectively demonstrates newly produced 
dopamine and the presence of functional AADC enzyme. 
PET was evaluated in each clinical study and typically demonstrated a statistical significance in 
putaminal-specific uptake of 18F-DOPA increases over time while no statistical significance was 
determined in association with patient age, suggesting that the observed increases in putaminal-
specific uptake of 18F-DOPA were a result of eladocagene exuparvovec administration. However, in 
Study AADC-011, mean putaminal-specific uptake on PET imaging was relatively unchanged during the 
study. Summary statistics of PET-specific uptake by time point for studies AADC-CU/1601, AADC-010 
and AADC-011 are provided in tables below.

Table 2 
Measurement of neurotransmitter metabolites 
The precursors L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) are 
decarboxylated by AADC to form dopamine and serotonin, respectively. After action at the nerve 
synapse, these neurotransmitters are reabsorbed into the presynaptic nerve terminal where they can 
either be repackaged into vesicles for future neurotransmitter release or metabolized to HVA (from 
dopamine) and 5-HIAA (from serotonin). In the presence of AADC deficiency, HVA and 5-HIAA levels in 
the CSF are very low or below the limits of detection due to the abnormally low dopamine and 
serotonin production, respectively. Upon restoration of AADC activity, concentrations of 5-HIAA and 
HVA in the CSF rise (Hyland 2006, Hyland 2007). 
The metabolites HVA and 5-HIAA were evaluated in each clinical study via a high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) method. At baseline, the concentrations of both metabolites were near or 
below the lower limit of quantitation in all patients with AADC deficiency, indicating little or no AADC 
enzyme activity. In each clinical study, the CSF concentration of HVA at 12 months after treatment was 
increased from baseline. Few patients showed increased CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA at 12 months, 
which was expected since infusion of eladocagene exuparvovec was not into the region of the brain 
that produces serotonin. Summary statistics for neurotransmitter metabolites by time point in studies 
AADC-CU/1601, AADC-010 and AADC-011 are provided below.

Immunogenicity assessment 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in each clinical study for anti-AAV2 antibodies in serum via an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. A positive titre was indicated by an optical density (OD) 
≥0.5. 
Study AADC-CU/1601 
The presence of anti-AAV2 antibodies was detected from Month 2 post-surgery. At Month 12, 2 out of 
the 6 patients who were evaluated had a positive anti-AAV2 antibody titre (Table 6).  
Table 6 
In a repeated measures analysis, anti-AAV2 OD value was not a statistically significant factor in the 
model, indicating that the magnitude of the change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores was not 
associated with the anti-AAV2 OD values (p=0.3843). There was also no correlation between anti-
AAV2 antibody titre and efficacy as measured by changes in PDMS-2 total score (Pearson correlation 
coefficient = -0.058).

Study AADC-010 
The presence of anti-AAV2 antibodies was detected from Month 3 post-surgery. At Month 12, 4 out of 
the 10 patients who were evaluated had a positive anti-AAV2 antibody titre but showed that titres were 
generally decreasing (Table 7). 
Table 7 
In a repeated measures analysis, anti-AAV2 OD value was a statistically significant factor in the model, 
indicating that the magnitude of the change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores was associated with 
the anti-AAV2 OD values (p=0.0003). There was moderate positive correlation between anti-AAV2 
antibody titre and increases in PDMS-2 total score (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.595). However, 
the increasing PDMS-2 total score indicates that over time, antibodies had no adverse impact on 
efficacy. 
Study AADC-011 
Anti-AAV2 antibody data at 3 months post-surgery was reported for 5 patients, 3 patients receiving 
1.8×1011 vg and 2 patients receiving 2.4×1011 vg. The presence of anti-AAV2 antibodies was 
detected in all 5 patients at Month 3. At Month 6, data reported for 4 patients showed that antibody 
titres were generally decreasing. Only 1 patient had an evaluation at Month 9 and their antibody titre 
remained stable from Month 6 (Table 8). 
Table 8 
In a repeated measures analysis, anti-AAV2 OD value was not a statistically significant factor in the 
model, indicating that the magnitude of the change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores was not 
associated with the anti-AAV2 OD values (p=0.1166). There was moderate positive correlation 
between anti-AAV2 antibody titre and increases in PDMS-2 total score (Pearson correlation coefficient 
= 0.713). However, the increasing PDMS-2 total score indicates that over time, antibodies had no 
adverse impact on efficacy.

Study AADC-1602 
Study AADC-1602, a 10-year, long-term follow-up study of clinical trial subjects was set up to collect 
long-term safety and efficacy data from these 3 studies for subjects who consented to participate. As 
part of this ongoing study, anti-AAV2 antibody data was available for 4 subjects at 24 months post-
administration of gene therapy as of the most recent data cut-off (26 February 2020). All 4 subjects 
were positive (optical density [OD]>0.5) (Ito 2009) for anti-AAV2 antibodies within 3 months following 
gene therapy and, in general, continual decrease in antibody titre was observed over the course of 24 
months. At 24 months, 2 of the 4 subjects were no longer considered to be positive for anti-AAV2 
antibodies (Table below). Although limited, the available 24-month data suggest that antibody titres 
appear to continue to decline over time.

Importantly, in these 3 clinical studies, clinical benefit was comparable and maintained, and adverse 
events generally occurred with a similar frequency, between subjects who had positive antibody titres 
and those who did not have positive antibody titres, indicating that the presence of anti-AAV2 
antibodies does not appear to impact the efficacy or safety of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods 
An ELISA method is used to detect anti-AAV2 antibodies in human serum. The assay is not product 
specific and instead uses AAV2 particles from a virus expressing beta galactosidase. The cut-off used in 
the assay to designate a positive sample is based on the level of neutralising antibodies to beta 
galactosidase. This approach is not supported. The applicant was requested to provide immunogenicity 
data from an appropriate assay which is validated in accordance with the EMA Guideline bioanalytical 
method validation. In the response to the day 170 list of issues, method validation is presented for two 
new assays to anti-AAV2 antibodies and neutralising anti-AAV2 antibodies. As discussed above in 
section 3.3.1, the total and neutralising anti-AAV2 antibody assays were used to analyse samples for 
subjects enrolled in the eladocagene exuparvovec clinical trial AADC-011 who were either treated with 
1.8×1011 vg (low dose group) or 2.4×1011 vg (high dose group). 
A real time PCR assay was used to quantify AAV2-hAADC in blood and urine. Sufficient details of the 
assay were provided. Details of method validation have been provided and are acceptable. 
A HPLC method was used to detect homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 
3-methoxytyrosine (3MT) in human CSF samples. The method is sufficiently validated and is 
considered acceptable.

Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated clinical PK studies were conducted. Conventional clinical pharmacokinetic studies may not 
be relevant for gene therapy products (EMA/CAT/80183/2014). The lack of dedicated clinical PK 
studies therefore is acceptable. 
There is a lack of information about biodistribution of the vector and active throughout the brain. The 
presumed rationale for not conducting biodistribution studies is that the active is administered 
intraputamen and not administered systemically. Shedding studies would indicate lack of systemic 
biodistribution of the active but preclinical studies in rats and immune response in humans indicate 
some systemic exposure. Biodistribution studies in the rat indicate a low risk of transmission to the 
gonads.  
Biodistribution of the active throughout the brain is also of interest but would involve biopsy of the 
brain which is considered too invasive. Indirect evidence of biodistribution is provided by the PD 
studies looking at putaminal specific uptake. Further data on biodistribution of the vector in the brain 
may be provided in the results of the post-mortem (if one was performed) on the child that died of 
encephalitis.  
For the population treated in this trial, germline transmission may not be of concern. However, for 
treatment of other populations i.e. adults, milder phenotypes, information about potential germline 
transmission may be of value. 
Samples of blood and urine were collected to assess viral shedding. The assessment schedule as 
outlined in the studies is acceptable. Overall, AAV2-hAADC vector viral shedding was not detected in 
any AADC patient blood or urine samples throughout the clinical development of eladocagene 
exuparvovec. These results indicate a low risk of transmission to third parties involved in caring for 
these children.  
The target population of Upstaza is considered a special population by itself. Clinical studies did not 
include neonates and infants less than 18 months, or subjects with impaired renal or hepatic function, 
but children from 18 months up to 8 years and 6 months of age and of both genders. The population 
studied only included one Caucasian subject, with the majority of subjects being of Asian 
races/ethnicities. There are no data presented for European subjects treated with the active. Given 
that the gene therapy replaces an enzyme that has a similar structure in all populations and the 
mechanism of action is similar for all populations and the target organ i.e. putamen in the brain is 
similar in all populations, it is expected that the effects may be similar in all populations including the 
European population. However, the causative mutation and the clinical phenotype may vary in different 
populations. 
In such an ultra rare orphan condition it is not always possible to recruit subjects with hepatic and 
renal impairment. As the new P188 excipient added to the commercial product is excreted by the 
kidney, it is not clear whether renal impairment might impact renal excretion of the excipient. Also, 
subjects with impaired hepatic and renal function may be prone to more adverse effects such as 
hypotension or gastrointestinal haemorrhage after surgery. The SmPC should be updated to include a 
statement in that there are no data available on treatment in subjects with renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
All Subjects treated after MAA will be followed with a Registry study so additional data relating to 
safety and efficacy in the European population, non-Asian subjects and patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment with AADC will become available post marketing.

Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic investigation is limited by the specific nature of the product, its primary target cell 
type and the intracellular localization of the expressed transgene, and the paediatric target population. 
The PD assessments of putaminal uptake is based on measurement of the activity of the enzyme that 
has been produced as a result of translation of the expression cassette. The substrate for the enzyme 
is L-Dopa which is decarboxylated by the AADC enzyme. The applicant provided available literature on 
18F-DOPA in the putamen of normal non-AADC children. After treatment with Upstaza, uptake of 18F-
DOPA increases but remains significantly lower than that observed in the non-AADC population. 
In studies AADC-CU/1601 and AADC-010, increases in putaminal-specific dopamine uptake was 
evident during follow-up. However, in study AADC-011, mean putaminal-specific uptake was relatively 
unchanged during follow-up. However, there was no clinically significant difference in milestone 
achievement in this group and those treated in other trials. The lack of uptake may reflect the non-
sensitivity of the assay. The increase in uptake of F-DOPA does not correlate with achievement of 
motor milestones. 
Concentrations of HVA and 5-HIAA in the CSF, as downstream metabolites of dopamine and serotonin, 
respectively, are appropriate as objective biomarkers for AADC activity. In all subjects, levels of these 
metabolites in the CSF were low or below the LLOQ at baseline. 
In all studies, there was an increase in the concentration of HVA in the CSF and this increase was 
maintained over time. This suggests increased AADC activity following treatment with eladocagene 
exuparvovec. By contrast, CSF 5-HIAA was relatively unchanged following treatment. The applicant 
explained that this is expected since the targeted region of the brain (putamen) does not contain 
serotonergic neurons. The main aim of treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec is to improve motor 
function. 
All AADC patients in the 3 clinical studies were assessed for detection of anti-AAV2 antibodies. The 
data suggest that there may be a risk of developing anti-AAV2 antibodies after administration of 
eladocagene exuparvovec (post-surgery). Further, anti-AAV2 antibodies appear to persist to 24 
months in some patients. Overall, the presence/development of antibodies to AAV2 does not appear to 
affect the efficacy of eladocagene exuparvovec, as measured by changes in PDMS-2 score. However, 
this observation is based on a limited number of patients. 
The relevant sections of the SmPC were updated stating that there is no safety or efficacy data for 
subjects whose pre-treatment antibody levels to AAV2 was greater than 1:20.  
Although patient from different ethnicities have been enrolled into the clinical studies, available data of 
patients treated with Upstaza at the proposed therapeutic dose that have completed the interventional 
study is too limited to allow for definite statements on genetic differences to PD response.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
As AADC deficiency is an ultra-rare paediatric disease; a formal dose-ranging study is not possible as 
this requires a greater number of patients than is available within this small population, as an 
estimated 60 patients would be required (assuming around 20 patients per dose group). Instead, 
strong nonclinical data in non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease and clinical data in 
patients with Parkinson's disease with rAAV2-hAADC vectors delivered to the putamen were used to 
guide the dose selection for a one-time administration of eladocagene exuparvovec for treating AADC 
deficiency. The intended dose of 1.8x1011 balances positive efficacy assessments with safety. 
Parkinson’s disease has been extensively studied and prior to recent work in AADC deficiency was the 
only other disease model to investigate the ability of the rAAV2-hAADC vector infused into the 
putamen to produce active AADC enzyme. Therefore, it was anticipated that this initial dose in children 
with AADC deficiency had a high probability of increasing AADC activity, which would be of direct 
clinical benefit in improving motor function and milestone achievement. The clinical benefit observed 
with eladocagene exuparvovec supports this expectation. 
Dose ranges and efficacy 
Intrastriatal (caudate/putamen) and intraputaminal (putamen only) delivery of rAAV2-hAADC vectors 
in a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease resulted in AADC protein expression and 
improvements in response to L-DOPA therapy as evaluated by neurological function (Muramatsu 2002, 
Bankiewicz 2006, Forsayeth 2006, Cunningham 2008). Doses tested in the different studies were from 
6×109 to 3.6×1011 vg. 
Forsayeth et al (2006) assessed multiple doses within a single preclinical Parkinson’s disease study 
(Forsayeth 2006). They evaluated the relationship rAAV2 hAADC dose infused into the putamen and 
efficacy including AADC enzyme activity in hemi-parkinsonian monkeys. The doses tested ranged from 
6×109 to 5×1011 vg. The study found that vector dose produced a linear increase in AADC enzyme 
activity in brain tissue at doses <5.5×1010 vg followed by a plateau starting at dose 1.7×1011 vg, 
indicating a saturation phenomenon in which higher doses showing little additional AADC enzyme 
activity. These results suggest that doses above 1.7×1011 produce little additional increase in 
expression of rAAV2 hAADC transgene (Forsayeth 2006). In the context in which there are no 
demonstrable gains in efficacy at higher doses, it becomes imperative to ensure safety. Based on the 
dose response efficacy observed in non-human primate Parkinson’s disease studies, rAAV2-hAADC was 
subsequently tested in the first-in-human clinical trials of patients with Parkinson’s disease at dose 
levels of 9×1010 and 3×1011 vg via bilateral intra-putaminal dosing (Christine 2009, Muramatsu 2010). 
Both doses were biologically active and well tolerated (Christine 2009). The prior findings in 
Parkinson’s disease patients were used to establish a dose that was expected to improve AADC activity 
in the putamen of children with AADC deficiency. Based on the relative average mass of a child brain 
(1000 g) being approximately 60% that of an adult brain (1350 g), and using brain weight scaling to a 
child brain, the dose of 1.8×1011 vg of eladocagene exuparvovec used in the AADC clinical trials in 
children is equal to approximately 60% of the highest dose used in Parkinson’s disease clinical trials in 
adults, which again was well tolerated. 
Dose ranges and safety 
When selecting the dose, the potential of adverse effects was considered. Higher doses than the 
intended 1.8×1011 would not be anticipated to meaningfully improve efficacy, as described above, but 
potentially could risk increased toxicity due to dopamine excess particularly in regions outside of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 55/132 
 
 
 
putamen. Excess dopamine can also result in medical and psychiatric consequences (Wichmann 1998, 
Bezard 2001). 
Intended dose 
The intended dose of 1.8×1011 vg is based on the fact that AADC activity and clinical benefit and safety 
have been demonstrated in 3 separate clinical studies with a follow up of 5 years’ post-gene-transfer 
with eladocagene exuparvovec. Eladocagene exuparvovec will be administered as a single infusion at a 
dose of 0.45×1011 vg and a volume of 80 μl per site to 4 sites (2 per putamen), for the total dose of 
1.8×1011 vg and a total volume of 320 μl per patient. In Study AADC-011, 5 patients (ages ≥2 and <3 
years) received a slightly higher dose of eladocagene exuparvovec at 2.4×1011 vg. The higher dose 
was selected for logistical reasons to remove a dilution step and simplify the administration of the 
study drug. The treatment benefit from this dose was similar to that observed with the lower 1.8×1011 
vg dose, which was not unexpected as the difference in dose is only 30%. Only the efficacy and safety 
findings for the lower dose which is the intended dose are presented below; see Summary of Clinical 
Efficacy 2.7.3 and Summary of Clinical Safety 2.7.4 for description of the 2.4×1011 vg dose result. 
These results are presented for both doses and demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The eladocagene exuparvovec clinical program is comprised of 3 studies (1 completed study and 2 
ongoing studies) in patients with AADC deficiency. All studies were conducted according to Good 
Clinical Practice standards. All studies were single-arm trials in which patients received treatment with 
eladocagene exuparvovec. The 3 studies were conducted at the same centre at the National Taiwan 
University Hospital. 
•  AADC-CU/1601 – completed; retrospective, compassionate use 
•  AADC-010 – ongoing; prospective, Phase 1/2 
•  AADC-011 – ongoing; prospective, Phase 2b 
The completed study (AADC-CU/1601, 8 patients), is an observational study that summarizes data 
from a compassionate use program of patients with AADC deficiency followed for 60 months (5 years). 
Evidence of durable clinical benefit and a favourable safety profile in the follow-up period of Study 
AADC-CU/1601 have justified continued clinical development of eladocagene exuparvovec for 
treatment of AADC deficiency.  
Each study & results is described below and in the integrated summary of efficacy presented. The 
studies that contribute to the primary efficacy endpoint are studies AADC-010 & study AADC-CU/1601. 
Study AADC-011 is considered a supportive study as data does not contribute to the primary endpoint 
at 24 months, as there is only data available at the 12-month time-point. 
Study AADC-010 
AADC-010 is a single-centre, prospective, single-arm, Phase 1/2 evaluation of the safety and efficacy 
of eladocagene exuparvovec. A single-arm design was utilized because a placebo control was not 
ethically feasible, spontaneous improvement in participants was not expected, the treatment 
intervention required a neurosurgical procedure, and the natural history of the disease was well 
characterized in this paediatric patient population with a rare disease. A natural history group served 
as a control for AADC-010. Study enrolment required a confirmed diagnosis of AADC deficiency. 
Patients were followed every 3 months for safety and efficacy assessments through the first year after 
treatment. The initial planned observation period was 1 year; however, patients voluntarily returned 
every 6 months to complete developmental tests and adverse event (AE) reporting. In addition, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

patients were recommended to have PD testing of central nervous system (CNS) AADC activity over 
time that included CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and L-6-[18F] fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalnine 
(18F-DOPA)PET at baseline and 1, 2, and 5 years post-treatment. The protocol was formally amended 
and approved by the IRB to collect study data through 5 years of follow-up. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
The study was expected to recruit 10 subjects with an evaluation period of 13 months. All subjects 
were recruited at a single hospital centre in Taiwan, which specialises in the treatment of children with 
AADC deficiency. 
Inclusion criteria 
1.  With a confirmed diagnosis of AADC, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis to show reduced 
levels of neurotransmitter metabolites, HVA and 5-HIAA, and higher L-Dopa, together with 
more than one mutation within AADC gene. 
2.  Classical clinical characteristics of AADC deficiency, such as oculogyric crises, hypotonia and 
developmental retardation. 
3.  The sick child has to be over 2 years old or a head circumference big enough for surgery. 
4.  Participating patients must cooperate completely for all evaluations and examinations before, 
during and after the whole trial. 
5.  Parents or guardians must sign to agree on this informed consent. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1.  Significant brain structure abnormality 
2.  Patients with any health or neurological doubts that may increase the risk of surgery cannot 
join this trial. PI has the right to evaluate the feasibility of subjects for this trial based on 
his/her health condition. 
3.  Since high-level neutralizing antibodies may disturb the therapeutic effect of gene therapy, 
patients with anti-AAV2 neutralizing antibody titre over 1,200 folds or an ELISA OD over 1 
cannot be enrolled into this trial. 
4.  Subjects enrolled in this clinical trial cannot take any medications that may affect this trial. 
Treatments 
Surgical procedure 
This surgery was performed by the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, National Taiwan 
University Hospital and under general anaesthesia. Prior to the surgery, putamen location was ensured 
by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). After the injection site was 
determined stereotactically, AAV-AADC was injected into putamen through the holes drilled in the skull 
outside of the putamen. After the surgery, head CT scan and MRI was performed to check for 
complications, such as bleeding.

Dosage and injection of viral vector 
Eladocagene exuparvovec was administered during a single operative session at a dose of 0.45×1011 
vg and a volume of 80 μL per site to 4 sites (2 per putamen), for a total dose of 1.8×1011 vg and a 
total volume of 320 μL per patient. 
Objectives 
The objectives of AADC-010 were:

Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The SAP described the statistical methods used in the reporting and in the analyses of data during the 
study.  Version 3.0 of the SAP was approved by the Sponsor on 3 April 2019. A Supplemental 
Statistical Analysis Plan (version 1.0) detailing additional analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints was 
approved on 6 September 2019. 
This SAP was to cover all data collected through the 12-month visit, as well as the motor development 
tests, PET data, adverse events, and concomitant medications collected after 12 months. 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations were defined for the study: 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population was to include all enrolled patients. All efficacy analyses were 
to be performed on the ITT population. 
The Safety Population was to include all enrolled patients who had been treated by AAV2-hAADC 
gene therapy. All safety analyses were to be performed on the safety population. 
Missing Data Conventions 
No missing value imputation was to be used - all analyses were to be based on the observed data. In 
the instance where lab data are recorded as below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), then the data 
was to be analysed as (1/2)*LLOQ. 
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoints 
At the 2-year time-point, the number and proportion of patients achieving each key motor milestone 
was computed, along with exact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Similar 
analysis at 1 year were to be provided as supportive analysis. 
The following tests were conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint milestone data at the 2-year time-
point under a sequential gatekeeping procedure, using a 1-sample exact binomial test at a 1-sided 
α=0.025 level of significance: 
1) H0: pHC = p0(HC) vs. H1: pHC > p0(HC) 
2) H0: pSU = p0(SU) vs. H1: pSU > p0(SU) 
3) H0: pSS = p0(SS) vs. H1: pSS > p0(SS) 
4) H0: pWA = p0(WA) vs. H1: pWA > p0(WA) 
where  
pHC is the proportion of patients achieving head control; 
pSU is the proportion of patients able to sit unassisted; 
pSS is the proportion of patients able to stand with support; and  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 59/132 
 
 
 
pWA is the proportion of patients able to walk with assistance.  
The chosen testing order of these hypotheses reflected the hierarchical order in which these milestones 
are typically achieved. 
The respective null values for each test, p0(HC), p0(SU), p0(SS), and p0(WA) will be the upper limit of the 
two-sided exact 95% confidence interval of the proportion of patients achieving the respective 
milestone from the natural history control group described in Wassenberg et al. (2017). This external 
control group is comprised of 82 patients, identified as severe by these authors, defined as having no 
or very limited developmental milestones and being fully dependent AADC deficient patients, and is 
claimed to represent the natural history of the disease in untreated patients. 
Medical history of the patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated for the achievement of these 
milestones prior to gene therapy. The number and proportion of patients achieving each key motor 
milestone prior to treatment will be computed, along with exact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). The applicant argues that this analysis would support the use of the natural 
history control group in that the pre-treatment milestone achievement rates in the AADC-010 patients 
are expected to be comparable to the rates in patients described in Wassenberg et al. (2017). 
An additional supportive analysis of key motor milestones at the 2-year time point was to involve a 
nonparametric approach, treating the motor milestones as ordered categories. Each patient will 
provide data as to the highest motor milestone achieved. That is, a patient will have one of the 
following responses: none, head control, sit unassisted, stand with support, walk with assistance. Note 
that since these are ordered categories, a patient cannot achieve the next milestone without first 
achieving all prior milestones based on the predefined ranking. 
The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was to be conducted at a two-sided α=0.05 level of significance to 
compare the AADC-010 patients to the natural history control group according to the following 
hypotheses: 
H0: The distribution of motor milestone achievement of patients treated with AADC gene therapy is 
equal to the distribution of untreated patients. 
H1: The distribution of motor milestone achievement of patients treated with AADC gene therapy is not 
equal to the distribution of untreated patients. 
This test was to be conducted irrespective of the results of the individual milestone testing described 
above. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Motor Development Tests  
Summary statistics were to be computed for PDMS-2, AIMS, and Bayley-III on the raw and change 
from baseline (CFB) scores by time point for each total score and/or subscale score. In addition, a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) on the mean (raw and CFB) was to be calculated for each time point for each 
scale and/or subscale. 
Each total score and subscale score was also to be evaluated by a repeated measures analysis using 
SAS PROC MIXED with fixed effects terms for time point, age at gene therapy (in months), and 
baseline score. A repeated statement was to be included to specify time point as the repeated effect, 
with patient identified in the patient option. The least squares (LS) mean CFB was to be estimated for 
each time point for each scale and/or subscale, along with a 95% CI.

Body Weight 
Body weight was to be recorded at each visit. Summary statistics were to be computed on the raw and 
CFB data by time point for body weight. In addition, a 95% CI on the mean weight was to be 
calculated for each time point. 
Neurological Exam Findings 
The presence of floppiness episodes, OGC episodes, limb dystonia, and stimulus-provoked dystonia 
was to be evaluated monthly for the first year of follow up. The number and proportion of patients with 
OGC episodes will be computed by time point, along with exact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). A similar analysis was to be performed for floppiness, limb dystonia, and 
stimulus-provoked dystonia. 
Muscle power data were collected on a 0-5 scale, and DTR data were collected on a 0-4 scale. The 
number and proportion of patients reporting each muscle power and DTR response (i.e., value on the 
0-5 or 0-4 categorical scale) were to be computed by time point. In addition, summary statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, range, and number of non-missing responses) for muscle power 
responses were to be computed by time point. 
Anti-AAV2 Optical Density Values 
Anti-AAV2 OD values were to be obtained at baseline, Months 1-6, Month 9, and Month 12. The 
number and proportion of patients with an OD value > 0.5 (i.e., OD values corresponding to a positive 
neutralizing antibody titre; Ito et al. 2009) will be computed by time point. A shift table was to be 
constructed to show the counts of patients in each shift category (negative/negative, negative/positive, 
positive/negative, positive/positive) from baseline to Month 12. 
To evaluate the potential relationship between the OD values and the PDMS-2 total score, a repeated 
measures analysis was to be conducted using SAS PROC MIXED with PDMS-2 total score change from 
baseline as the response and with fixed effects terms for time point, OD value, and baseline score. A 
repeated statement was to be included to specify time point as the repeated effect, with patient 
identified in the patient option. The significance of the OD values as an explanatory variable for the 
variability in PDMS-2 scores over time was to be reported via the tests of fixed effects table. In 
addition, Pearson’s correlation between the PDMS-2 scores and OD values was be computed by patient 
and overall. 
Analysis of pharmacodynamics endpoints 
CSF Neurotransmitter Metabolites 
The neurotransmitter metabolites were to be evaluated at baseline and Month 12. Summary statistics 
will be computed on the raw and CFB data by time point for each of these metabolites. In addition, a 
95% CI on the mean values was to be calculated for each time point. 
Putaminal Signal in PET 
PET 18 F-fluorodopa uptake in the left putamen, right putamen, and occipital lobe was to be recorded 
at baseline, Month 12, and Month 24. These values were to be used to compute the specific uptake at

Summary statistics for each PET parameter were to be computed on the raw and CFB data by time 
point. In addition, a 95% CI on the mean values was to be calculated for each time point. 
Specific uptake was also to be evaluated by a repeated measures analysis using SAS PROC MIXED with 
fixed effects terms for time point and age at gene therapy (in months). A repeated statement was to 
be included to specify time point as the repeated effect, with patient identified in the patient option. 
The least squares (LS) mean will be estimated for each time point, along with a 95% CI. 
Patient Completion 
A table was to be constructed with counts and percentages of patients who completed the study 
through Month 12 and patients who withdrew from the study. Of the patients who withdrew from the 
study, the number and percent of patients with each withdrawal reason was to be reported. 
Counts and percentages of patient completion were also to be provided for the following duration of 
follow up categories: 0 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, 9 to 12 months, and 12 to 24 
months. Patients will be counted once in this analysis according to their entire duration of follow up. 
External Control 
The natural history control was based on a systematic literature review of all available reported AADC 
deficiency cases, which was performed by Wassenberg et al (Wassenberg 2017). This review identified 
117 confirmed AADC deficiency cases, of which 103 had sufficient information to adjudicate severity. 
From these 103 cases, a total of 82 AADC-deficient patients were considered as having a severe 
phenotype, which was defined as having no or very limited developmental milestones and being fully 
dependent AADC deficient patients. The applicant claims that this group of patients is comparable to 
the patients enrolled in the 3 eladocagene exuparvovec clinical studies and therefore suitable for use 
as a natural history control. 
Interim analysis 
No formal interim analyses were planned for this study. 
Results 
Participant flow 
All subjects who were screened were included in the trial and treated with the active. All subjects had 
their primary efficacy endpoint measured at 24 months. One subject was lost to follow-up due to death 
secondary to encephalitis. The trial is currently ongoing. 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 52.5 months (range 21.0 to 102.0 months), there were 5 males and 5 females, 9 
patients were Asian-Chinese, and 1 was White. As of the data cut-off (27 March 2019), the mean 
duration of follow-up was 39.9 months and 9 patients completed follow-up through Month 24. 
Prior Medications in 2 or More Patients (Safety Population) 
Most patients received prior medications. The most frequently administered prior medications included 
hypnotics and sedatives (9 patients, 90%), dopaminergic agents and plain vitamin preparations (8 
patients each, 80%), and expectorants excluding combinations with cough suppressants (7 patients, 
70%).

Concomitant Medications 
The most common classes of concomitant medication administered to all patients within 12 months of 
eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy were anti-inflammatory agents, antipsychotics, expectorants 
(excluding combinations with cough suppressants), hypnotics and sedatives, and other analgesics and 
antipyretics. The use of most classes of medication was stable from within 12 months of treatment to 
within 24 months of treatment. 
There was an increase in use of IV solutions (from 4 to 8 patients) and nasal decongestants for 
systemic use (from 2 to 4 patients); Use of dopaminergic agents for AADC deficiency after treatment 
was recorded in a total of 4 patients. In 8 patients, dopaminergic agents were taken prior to 
eladocagene exuparvovec therapy as standard of care for AADC. As directed by the Investigator, these 
agents were then stopped within 1 month prior to the gene therapy or 10 days after therapy. In 4 
patients, treatment with dopaminergic agents (either the original agent or a new agent) was started 
within 24 months of eladocagene exuparvovec treatment for alleviation of AADC deficiency-associated 
symptoms in accordance with standard of care.

Outcomes and estimation 
For Study AADC-010, at 24 months, 5 (55.6%) patients had mastered head control, 3 (33.3%) were 
able to sit unassisted, and 2 (22.2%) were able to stand with support. In contrast, none of the natural 
history control group patients achieved any motor milestones. Achievements for head control (p 
value<0.0001) and sitting unassisted (p=0.0059) were highly statistically significant compared with 
the natural history control group. 
Figure 6 Key Motor Milestone Acquisition from Study AADC-010 at Month 24 (ITT Population, N=10) 
Figure 7 Patients Achieving Key Motor Milestones (ITT Population) 
Key motor milestone acquisition continued after the primary efficacy assessment at the 2-year time-
point. Full head control was achieved at Month 30 by Patient 1005 and at Month 36 by Patient 1001, 
bringing the number of patients who achieved this milestone after eladocagene exuparvovec gene 
therapy to 7 (70%). In addition, Patient 1002 was able to sit unassisted at Month 48, and Patient 
1004, who achieved head control, sitting unassisted, and standing with support by Month 18, was able 
to walk with assistance at Month 36. 
LS Means of Post-treatment PDMS-2 Total Scores for Studies AADC- 010 (ITT Population) 
Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients showed statistically significant increases in PDMS-2 total 
scores over time. All patients achieved clinically meaningful improvement in PDMS-2 total scores that 
were maintained or continued to improve over the course of the study. The onset of improvement was 
also observed within months of gene therapy, and the LS mean change from baseline was PDMS-2 
total score was statistically significant (p value<0.0001) at the 24-month time-point and continued to 
improve up to 4 years, which was the length of available follow-up at the data cut-off. The distribution 
of motor milestone achievement in the eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy patients at 2 years post 
treatment was significantly different compared to the natural history control group (p<0.0001). 
PDMS-2 total and subscale scores, when assessed by visit using a repeated measures mixed effects 
model that tested fixed effects, were consistently statistically significant (p≤0.05). 
Assessment report

Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients showed increases in mean PDMS-2 subscale scores from 
baseline to Year 2, with the exception of reflexes and object manipulation. The increases in mean 
PDMS-2 total and subscale scores relative to baseline were evident as early as Month 3. Similar results 
were demonstrated at the 1-year time-point. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients also demonstrated improvement of specific skills on the 
PDMS-2 subscales that represent additional evidence of clinical benefit and development toward more 
independent motor function, including sitting, symmetrical posture, rolling, manipulating a rattle and 
paper, engaging one’s own fingers, reaching for a rattle, removing socks, and turning pages. These 
observations are detailed in the individual patient profiles.

Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients showed increases in mean AIMS total scores from baseline 
over time that were statistically significant (p<0.0001) at the 2-year time-point and that were 
maintained up to 4 years, which was the length of available follow-up at the data cut-off. Six patients 
(60%) achieved and maintained AIMS total score increases of approximately 20 to 40 points.

Improvement in Cognitive Function 
Cognitive function was assessed by the Bayley-III in Study AADC-010. 
Bayley-III 
At the 24-month time-point, the LS mean change from baseline in Bayley-III total scores for patients 
in Study AADC-010 was statistically significant (p value<0.0001) and continued to improve up to 48 
months (4 years). Increases from baseline in all mean Bayley-III subscales were also observed at 12 
months and were evident as early as Month 3. 
At baseline in Study AADC-010 (n=10), most patients exhibited minimal cognitive skills including 
calming when being picked up, continuous gazing at an object, responding to stimuli (rattle), 
responding to a bell, and recognizing caregivers. 
Over the 24-month period, examples of cognitive skills newly developed include the following: 
•  6 patients explored objects using shaking, using their mouths, or other activity 
•  3 patients reacted to the disappearance of a caregiver’s face 
•  7 patients persistently reached for objects 
•  9 patients responded to their image in the mirror by smiling, laughing, patting, etc. 
•  5 patients played with a string (picking it up, chewing, manipulating, pulling) 
•  6 patients looked for a fallen toy on the floor 
•  5 patients held a bell by the handle and rang it on purpose 
•  5 patients reached for an additional block while already holding one 
Examples of receptive language skills newly developed over the 24-month period include the 
following: 
•  6 patients turned their head toward sound 
•  7 patients interacted with an object for at least 60 seconds 
•  4 patients stopped reaching for an object in response to a “no-no”

•  3 patients-maintained attention and enjoyed interacting/playing with a caregiver for at least 60 
seconds 
•  9 patients responded in an appropriate manner to at least one request 
Examples of expressive language skills newly developed over the 24-month period include the 
following: 
•  3 patients used 2-vowel sounds 
•  5 patients used 2 consonant sounds 
•  9 patients imitated at least one consonant-vowel combination 
•  5 patients actively participated in at least 1 play routine 
•  8 patients jabbered expressively 
•  6 patients used one-word approximations

Body Weight 
There was a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean body weight at Year 1 (p=0.0011)

Neurologic Examination Findings 
Following eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy, the number of patients with floppiness, OGC 
episodes, limb dystonia and stimulus-provoked limb dystonia decreased during the first year. In most 
cases, reductions in the number of patients with these neurologic findings were apparent as early as 
Month 3 following treatment. Limb dystonia and stimulus-provoked limb dystonia did not occur in any 
patient at the Month 9 and Month 6 neurologic examination, respectively, and thereafter through 
Month 12. The majority of the patients had neurologic findings on examination pre-surgery. 
Immunogenicity 
As anticipated, no patients had a positive antibody titre at baseline. The presence of anti- AAV2 
antibodies was detected in 4 (40%) patients at Month 3, 8 (80%) patients at Month 6, and 7 (70%) 
patients at Month 9 following treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy. At Month 12, 4 
patients (40%) had a positive anti-AAV2 antibody titre (OD value >0.5). Change from baseline in 
PDMS-2 total scores was evaluated by a repeated measures analysis with anti-AAV2 OD values as a 
fixed effect. The anti-AAV2 OD value was a statistically significant factor in the model, indicating that 
the magnitude of the change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores was associated with the anti-AAV2 
OD values (p=0.0003). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for these data. The overall 
correlation was 0.59510, indicating a moderate positive correlation between anti-AAV2 antibody titre 
and increases in PDMS-2 total score. However, the increasing PDMS-2 total score indicates that over 
time, antibodies had no adverse impact on efficacy. 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
Change from Baseline in Neurotransmitter Metabolites 
The presence of neurotransmitter metabolites HVA (the metabolite of dopamine) and 5-HIAA (the 
metabolite of serotonin) was measured in CSF during the first year of follow up. At Month 12, the 
concentration of both HVA and 5-HIAA were increased compared with Baseline.

Putaminal-Specific Uptake 
An increase in mean putaminal-specific uptake of 18F-DOPA on PET imaging was evident at Month 12 
and further increased through Month 24. 
Figure 16 PET Specific Uptake by Time Point (ITT Population) 
In a repeated measures analysis of PET imaging of putaminal-specific 18F-DOPA uptake with fixed 
effect terms for time-point and age at gene therapy, age at the time of treatment was determined not 
to be statistically significant, indicating that the magnitude of the change in putaminal specific uptake 
was not associated with age (p=0.3760). The repeated measures analysis of putaminal-specific uptake 
by time-point was statistically significant (p=0.0002), indicating that putaminal-specific uptake of 18F-
DOPA increases over time.

Study AADC-CU1601 
Study AADC-CU/1601 is a single-centre, observational study that summarized and analysed data from 
a single arm, compassionate use interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
intraputaminal infusion of eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy in children with AADC deficiency for 
a period of up to 60 months after study drug administration. Eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy at 
a total dose of 1.8 × 1011 vg was administered during a single operative session. The planned duration 
of the study was 1 year, and patients returned voluntarily every 6 months to complete developmental 
tests (PDMS-2, AIMS, and CDIIT) and adverse event (AE) reporting for up to 60 months. 
Efficacy Data from this study at 24 months is used in the assessment of the primary endpoint. 
Therefore, the study is presented as one of the main studies. 
This was the first study started by the neurosurgical centre in Taiwan. After the start of the 
compassionate use programme, a study with an approved protocol was started. Eight patients were 
treated as part of the compassionate use programme. There is 5 year’s follow-up on 6 of them. 
Treatments 
Surgical procedure 
This surgery was performed by the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, National Taiwan 
University Hospital, and under general anaesthesia. Prior to the surgery, putamen location was 
ensured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). After the injection 
site was determined stereotactically, AAV-AADC was injected into putamen through the holes drilled in 
the skull outside of putamen. After the surgery, head CT scan and MRI was performed to check for 
complications, such as bleeding.

Treatment Administered 
AAV2-hAADC (eladocagene exuparvovec) was administered under the AADC-CU treatment plan during 
a single operative session at a dose of 0.45×1011 vg and a volume of 80 μl per site to 4 sites (2 per 
putamen), for a total dose of 1.8×1011 vg and a total volume of 320 μl per patient. 
Objectives 
The objective of the AADC-compassionate use treatment plan was to evaluate the safety and long-term 
benefits of administration of the hAADC gene with the AAV2 vector to patients with AADC deficiency.  
The primary objective of the AADC-CU/1601 protocol was to collect data from patients with AADC 
deficiency who received humanitarian assistance treatment following AAV2-hAADC administration via 
intraputaminal injection, and further to observe the safety and efficacy fora period of up to 60 months 
(5 years) after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec. 
The objectives from the 2 studies were integrated in the statistical analysis plan as follows: The 
primary objective of this single-arm, interventional study was to retroactively evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of intraputaminal infusion of eladocagene exuparvovec in children with AADC deficiency for a 
period of up to 60 months after study drug administration.

Note: In version 1.2 of the AADC-CU treatment plan, an additional exclusion criterion was added: the 
patient has anti-AAV2 neutralizing antibody titre over 1200-fold. In version 1.3, this criterion was 
clarified: the patient has anti-AAV2 neutralizing antibody titre over 1200-fold or an ELISA OD over 1. 
Exclusion Criteria for AADC-1601 Study 
Patients were excluded from the AADC-CU/1601 study for any of the following reasons: 
1.  Subjects for whom informed consent was not obtained, as described in Inclusion criteria. 
Outcomes/endpoints for AADC-1601 Study 
Achievement of key motor milestones at the 60-month time-point was the primary measure of 
efficacy.  
Primary efficacy endpoints related to the achievement of such milestones are as follows: 
-Proportion of patients who achieved full head control, as measured using the Peabody Developmental 
Motor Scales-Second Edition (PDMS-2) 
-Proportion of patients who were able to sit unassisted, as measured using the PDMS-2 
-Proportion of patients who were able to stand with support, as measured using the PDMS-2 
-Proportion of patients who were able to walk with assistance, as measured using the PDMS-2. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Raw scores for the PDMS-2 total and subscales (Month 60) 
•  Raw scores for the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) total and subscales (Month 60) 
•  Raw scores for the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT) 
whole test and subtests (Month 60) 
•  Change from baseline in body weight (collected at each visit) 
•  Neurological examination findings with respect to muscle tone (i.e. floppiness), oculogyric 
crisis (OGC) episodes, dystonia, muscle power, and deep tendon reflex (DTR) response (every 
month for the first year of follow-up).

Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
•  Change from baseline in the neurotransmitter metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-HIAA 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at Months 6, 12, and 60 
•  Change from baseline in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of putaminal-specific L-
6-[18F] fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalnine (18F-DOPA) PET uptake at Months 6, 12, and 60. 
Safety Endpoints 
The safety endpoints were: 
•  All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (from surgery start time to Month 60) 
•  Neurological exam findings (excluding muscle tone, OGC episodes, dystonia, muscle power, 
and DTR response) (collected monthly for the first year of follow-up) 
•  Viral shedding 
Sleep Study 
Sleep parameters, including total sleep time, total sleep period, sleep efficiency, 
obstructive/central/mixed apnea, Apnea Hypopnea Index, and hypopnea were measured prior to 
surgery and at 12 weeks after administration of study treatment. 
Sample size 
There was no formal sample size calculation for this study as the recruitable subject pool was small. 
Eight patients were enrolled in the study and received eladocagene exuparvovec infusion, and 
therefore comprise both the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Safety populations. The majority of patients (6 
[75%]) completed the study. 
Randomisation 
This was an uncontrolled open-label study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an uncontrolled open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Similar statistical analysis methods to trial AADC-010. The analysis of data was retrospective as the 
study had started and data was being collected before the protocol and SAP had been finalised. 
Results 
Participant flow

provided in table above 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
The majority of subjects (8 [100.0%]) received prior medications. The most frequently administered 
prior medications included anaesthetics, general, hypnotics and sedatives (7 patients [87.5%] each), 
other beta-lactam antibacterials (5 patients [62.5%]), anti-inflammatory agents, dopaminergic agents, 
expectorants, excluding combinations with cough suppressants, and vitamin B12 and folic acid (4 
patients each [50.0%]), adrenergics (inhalants), cardiac stimulants excluding cardiac glycosides, drugs 
for peptic ulcer and gastro-oeosophageal reflux, muscle relaxants (peripherally acting agents) (3 
patients [37.5%] each). The remaining prior medications were taken by 2 patients or less. 
Number and Percent of Subjects Taking Concomitant Medications 
The most frequently administered concomitant medications included blood and related products (8 
patients; albumin was used to prime the tubing prior to infusion), antipsychotics (haloperidol, 
risperdal, and risperidone) and drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux (5 patients each), 
and dopaminergic agents and other beta-lactam antibacterials (4 patients). 
Assessment report

Concomitant medications that were newly administered included anticholinergics, antipsychotics, 
antithrombotics, blood and related products, corticosteroids plain, lipid-modifying agents plain, muscle 
relaxants centrally acting agents, mydriatics and cycloplegics, other gynaecologicals, and other 
systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases. 
Concomitant medications that increased after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec included 
drugs for functional bowel disorders, drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux, muscle 
relaxants centrally acting agents, mydriatics and cycloplegics. 
Concomitant medications that decreased after administration of eladocagene exuparvovec included 
adrenergics inhalants, expectorants, hypnotics and sedatives, IV solution additives, nasal 
decongestants for systemic use, opioids, other analgesics and antipyretics, other anti-anaemic 
preparations, other beta-lactam antibacterials, vitamin B12 and folic acid, and vitamin K and other 
haemostatics. Of note, use of dopaminergic agents for AADC deficiency was recorded in a total of 4 
patients. In all 4 patients, dopaminergic agents were taken prior to eladocagene exuparvovec infusion 
as standard of care for AADC. As directed by the Investigator, these agents were then stopped within 1 
month prior to the eladocagene exuparvovec infusion or 10 days after the infusion. However, in all 4 
patients, treatment with dopaminergic agents (either the same agent as originally or a new agent) was 
reinstated within 12 months after the eladocagene exuparvovec infusion for alleviation of AADC 
deficiency-associated symptoms in accordance with standard of care. 
Numbers analysed 
There were 8 subjects in the ITT population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with AADC 
deficiency. At month 60, 50% of patients mastered the motor milestones of head control and sitting 
unassisted (4 of 8 patients), resulting in clinically and statistically significant (p=0.0002 for both 
comparisons) benefits compared with natural history control. At month 60, two patients (25%) were 
able to stand with support.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
PDMS-2 
Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients showed increases in PDMS-2 total scores over time. Onset 
of improvement was observed as early as 3 months. There was a statistically significant change from 
baseline in LS means for PDMS-2 total score (p<0.0001compared to baseline) at 60 months post-
eladocagene exuparvovec treatment. PDMS-2 total and subscale scores, when assessed by visit using a 
repeated measures mixed effects model that included a combination of fixed and random effects, were 
consistently statistically significant (p≤0.003) for all models assessed. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients showed increases in mean PDMS-2 subscale scores from 
baseline to 60 months with the exception of reflexes (data captured for 3 patients only). The increases 
in mean PDMS-2 total and subscale scores relative to baseline were evident from as early as Month 3. 
Similar results were demonstrated at the 12- and 24-month time-points. Eladocagene exuparvovec-
treated patients also demonstrated improvement of specific skills on the PDMS-2 subscales that 
represent additional evidence of clinical benefit and development toward more independent motor 
function, including sitting, rolling, grasping a rattle or cube, removing pegs, and placing cubes. These 
observations are detailed in the individual patient narratives. 
AIMS 
There was a statistically significant change from baseline in LS means for AIMS total score (p<0.0001) 
at 60 months post-eladocagene exuparvovec administration. Three patients achieved and maintained 
AIMS total score increases of 30 or more points Similar to PDMS-2 subscale scores, increases from 
baseline in all mean AIMS subscale scores were also observed at 60 months. 
The increases in mean AIMS total and subscale scores were evident from as early as 3 months and 
were sustained throughout the study. AIMS subscale scores at 12 and 24 months post eladocagene 
exuparvovec administration showed a similar pattern to PDMS-2 subscale scores in that they increased 
from baseline and were consistent with the 60-month data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

Cognitive/Language Developmental Test: CDIIT 
There was a statistically significant increase in change from baseline in LS mean CDIIT total test scores 
for eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients at 60 months (p<0.0001). Increases from baseline in 
mean CDIIT subscale scores were also observed at 60 months. Increases from baseline in mean CDIIT 
total score and all subscales were also observed at 12 and 24 months. The increases in mean CDIIT 
total test and subscale scores were evident from as early as Month 6. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients also demonstrated specific skills on the CDIIT that 
represent additional evidence of clinical benefit and development toward independent motor function, 
such as grasping a food item or toy when not previously able. These details are described for each 
patient in the individual patient narratives provided. CDIIT subscale scores at 12 and 24 months post 
administration of eladocagene exuparvovec increased from baseline and were consistent with the 60-
month subscale data. Change from baseline data for CDIIT total and subscale scores as assessed by 
fixed effect of visit, age (months) at gene therapy administration, and baseline CDIIT score are 
summarized. 
Body Weight 
Body weight increased for the majority of patients in the study. There was a statistically significant 
increase in mean body weight through 60 months (p=0.0270). 
Neurologic Examination Findings 
The majority of the patients had neurologic findings on examination pre-surgery. Following treatment 
with eladocagene exuparvovec, the number of patients with floppiness, OGC episodes, limb dystonia, 
and stimulus provoked- dystonia decreased during the first year. No subjects showed floppiness at 12 
months after eladocagene exuparvovec administration, however, the number of patients evaluated at 
the 12-month time-point was small (N=8 at baseline decreased to N=2 patients at the 12-month time-
point). In most cases, reductions in the number of patients with these neurologic findings were 
apparent as early as Month 1 following treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec. The two patients 
evaluated at Month 12 who reported OCG episodes had also reported these events at baseline, and 1 
reported limb dystonia that had not been reported at baseline, and neither reported floppiness or 
stimulus-provoked dystonia. 
Immunogenicity 
As anticipated, there were no patients with a positive antibody titre at baseline. The presence of anti-
AAV2 antibodies was detected from Month 2 following treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec. At 
Month 12, 2 out of the 6 patients who were evaluated had a positive anti-AAV2 antibody titre (OD 
value >0.5). 
There was no correlation between anti-AAV2 antibody titre and efficacy as measured by changes in 
PDMS-2 total score. Change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores was evaluated by a repeated 
measures analysis with anti-AAV2 OD values as a fixed effect. The anti-AAV2 OD value was not a 
statistically significant factor in the model, indicating that the magnitude of the change from baseline in 
PDMS-2 total scores was not associated with the anti-AAV2 OD values (p=0.3843) A Pearson 
correlation coefficient was calculated for these data. The overall correlation was -0.05758, indicating 
Assessment report

no correlation between anti-AAV2 antibody titre and efficacy as measured by changes in PDMS-2 total 
score. 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
Change from Baseline in Neurotransmitter Metabolites. The presence of neurotransmitter metabolites 
HVA (the metabolite of dopamine) and 5-HIAA (the metabolite of serotonin) was measured in CSF 
during the first year of follow-up. The concentration of HVA at Month 6 and Month 12 was increased 
compared with baseline. The concentration of 5-HIAA was slightly increased at Month 6, with no 
change from baseline at Month 12. 
Figure 19 Summary Statistics for Neurotransmitter Metabolites by Time Point 
An increase in mean putaminal-specific uptake on PET imaging was evident as early as Month 6 and 
further increased through Month 60. In a repeated measures analysis of PET imaging of putaminal-
specific uptake with fixed effect terms for visit and age at gene therapy, age at the time of treatment 
was determined not to be statistically significant, indicating that the magnitude of the change in 
putaminal specific uptake was not associated with age (p=0.2516). The repeated measures analysis of 
putaminal-specific uptake by time point was statistically significant (p=0.0134), indicating that 
putaminal-specific uptake of 18F-DOPA increases over time. An increase in LS mean putaminal-specific 
uptake was evident as early as Month 6 and continued through Month 12 and Month 60 
Ancillary analyses 
Sleep Study 
Two patients completed their sleep studies. Results from one of the patients, suggested abnormal 
results prior to surgery and normal results after administration of gene therapy. Results from the other 
patient were considered normal before surgery and after administration of gene therapy. 
The sleep study was a small study with 2 patients, which demonstrated that treatment with gene 
therapy did not appear to have a detrimental effect on sleep pattern in those treated and may have a 
beneficial effect on subjects’ sleep patterns. More data on sleep in these subjects before and after 
treatment would be needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.

Title: Compassionate Use Treatment With AGIL-AADC In Patients With AADC Deficiency 
Study identifier 
AADC-CU/1601 
Design 
Study AADC-CU/1601 is a single-center study that summarized and analysed 
data from a single arm, compassionate use interventional study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of intraputaminal infusion of eladocagene exuparvovec 
(AGIL-AADC) gene therapy in children with AADC deficiency for a period of up 
to 60 months after study drug administration. Eladocagene exuparvovec gene 
therapy at a total dose of 1.8×1011 vg was administered during a single 
operative session. The planned duration of the study was 1 year, and patients 
returned voluntarily every 6 months to complete developmental tests to 
measure efficacy (Peabody Developmental Motor Scale [PDMS-2], Alberta 
Infant Motor Scale [AIMS], and Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for 
Infants and Toddlers [CDIIT]) and positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging of putaminal-specific L-6-[18F] fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenalaynine 
(18F-DOPA) uptake in the putamen, and capture adverse event (AE) reporting 
for up to 60 months. This study used a natural history control as the 
comparator for the primary efficacy endpoint.

2.6.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated Efficacy Results 
Primary Analysis: Acquisition of Key Motor Milestones 
As of the cut-off date for this submission (27 March 2019), 8 patients from Study AADC-CU/1601 and 
10 patients from Study AADC-010 contributed data to the primary endpoint, which was assessed at 24 
months (2 years). The primary analysis evaluated the percentage of patients achieving the sequential 
motor milestones of full-head control, sitting unassisted, standing with support, and walking with 
assistance. These are consistent with the key motor milestones reported in the medical literature as 
clinically meaningful in children (Bertenthal 1998, WHO Multicenter Growth Reference Study (MGRS) 
Group 2006). 
Patients from Study AADC-011 do not contribute data to the primary efficacy endpoint because that 
study is a 12-month study. The data cut-off date for ongoing studies that contributed to integrated 
analysis is 27 March 2019 (Study AADC-010). Treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec demonstrated 
clinical benefit in patients with AADC deficiency. At 24 months after gene therapy, 9 patients (50.0%) 
were able to master full-head control, 7 (38.9%) were able to sit unassisted, and 2 (11.1%) were able 
to stand with support; this is in contrast to no key motor milestone acquisition in the natural history 
control group. The achievements for head control and sitting unassisted were highly significant for 
patients treated with eladocagene exuparvovec gene therapy compared with the natural history control 
group (p value<0.0001 for both comparisons). These results are further supported by nonparametric 
analysis, which indicated a significant difference in the highest motor milestone achieved by each 
patient between eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients compared with natural history controls (p 
value<0.0001). 
Figure 20 Number and Proportion of Patients Achieving Key Motor Milestones a Month 24 (FAS) 
Acquisition of motor milestones was assessed 12 months following surgery. At 12 months post gene 
therapy, 5 patients in Study AADC-CU/1601 and Study AADC-010 had mastered head control and 3 
patients could sit unassisted (purple shading indicates milestone achievement, grey indicates no 
milestone achievement, and yellow indicates emerging skills).

Importantly, in patients who achieved head control, key motor milestone acquisition was maintained, 
and in some patients additional milestones were achieved after the primary efficacy assessment at the 
24-month time-point, as some patients achieved the ability to stand and walk with assistance. For 
example, between Months 24 and 48 follow-up time-point, several patients achieved new milestones: 
•  3 patients obtained full-head control  
•  2 patients achieved the ability to sit unassisted  
•  1 patient was able to stand with support  
•  1 patient achieved the ability to walk with assistance  
From the Month 54 to Month 60 follow-up time-points, another patient developed the ability to stand 
with support. 
As described above attaining a motor milestone was defined as a patient obtaining a score of 2 on an 
individual item in PDMS-2. Achieving a score of 2 indicates “mastery” of the skill item and sets a “high 
bar” for evaluating treatment efficacy. The PDMS-2 also assesses emerging skills that indicate a child 
has demonstrated the development of a given function but has not achieved mastery; patients with 
emerging skills would have scored a 1. 
Eight patients in Studies AADC-CU/1601 and AADC-010 demonstrated emerging skills for a milestone 
at the time of data cut-off (27 March 2019) (yellow shading). For example, one patient (010-1003) 
scored 1 for head control (ISE Listing 3) at Months 18 and 48 and one patient (010-1005) scored 1 for 
sitting unassisted at Months 36, 42, and 48. Interestingly, exhibiting an emerging skill (achieving a 
score of 1) at a given time was often indicative of mastering a skill in the following month(s). Although 
not part of the primary endpoint analysis, some patients in Study AADC-011 did achieve motor 
milestones within the 1-year follow-up period. Of the patients in StudyAACD-011 that have been 
followed for 12 months (n=7), 4 patients developed full-head control within that time frame. 
Sensitivity Analysis to Support Natural History Comparison 
The primary analysis was a comparison against 82 patients with AADC deficiency described by 
Wassenberg as severe, having achieved “no or very limited developmental milestones”. For the 
purposes of this analysis, we assumed that these patients achieved less than the study-defined PDMS-
2-based milestones (see Section 1.4.2 for full details).A sensitivity analysis was performed and further 
supports the findings that eladocagene exuparvovec therapy results in meaningful clinical benefit in 
patients with AADC deficiency compared with the natural history control. The sensitivity analysis used 
a conservative approach that assumed the moderate patients in the natural history control group 
achieved all motor milestones. This analysis was consistent with the primary natural control analysis 
and found that a greater proportion of patients treated with eladocagene exuparvovec achieved full-
head control compared with the natural history control (50% vs. 15%, respectively; p=0.0157). No 
difference was observed between groups for sitting unassisted, standing with support, or walking with 
assistance (p values ≥0.1217). Mild patients were not included in the sensitivity analysis as they were 
defined by Wassenberg, et al, as having mild delay in development of motor milestones, ambulatory 
without assistance, and mild intellectual abilities.

Figure 21 Acquisition and Maintenance of Key Motor Milestones up to Month 60 (Studies AADC-
CU/1601 and AADC-010) 
Eight patients from Study AADC-CU/1601 were evaluable at the 60-month time-point. At that time, 4 
patients (50%) had head control and could sit unassisted and 2 patients (25%) could stand with 
support. These collective results demonstrate continued improvement of motor milestone acquisition 
over a longer follow-up period. Additional information about persistence of efficacy beyond the 24-
month time-point can be found in below.

Secondary Endpoints 
PDMS-2 Total Scores and Subscale Scores Over Time 
All patients treated with eladocagene exuparvovec showed clinically meaningful increases in mean 
PDMS-2 total scores over time, with some as early as 3 months. At the 24-month time-point, the LS 
mean of change from baseline in PDMS-2 total scores (94.3, 95% CI 75.6, 112.9) was significant (p 
value<0.0001). Consistent with the PDMS-2 total score results at Month 24, the LS mean change from 
baseline at Month 12 (63.3, 95% CI 45.4, 81.1) and Month 60 (113.1, 95% CI 90.0, 136.1) were also 
clinically meaningful. Increases LS means for PDMS-2 subscale scores were observed, with positive 
changes observed at 24 months post therapy.

Figure 25 Mean PDMS-2 Total Scores by Patient and Chronological Age – Through Month 60 (FAS) 
At the 24-month time-point, the LS mean of change from baseline in AIMS total scores (21.9, 
95% CI 16.1, 27.6) was statistically significant (p<0.0001) compared with baseline scores. Of the 14 
patients with evaluable AIMS data at the 24-month time-point, all patients showed increases in AIMS 
total score of 5 points or greater, which was designated as a meaningful change by the study 
investigator (ISE, Listing 5). Consistent with the AIMS total score results at Month 24, the LS mean 
change from baseline at Month 12 (15.6, 95% CI 10.1, 21.2) and Month 60 (29.3, 95% CI 21.7, 36.9) 
were also clinically meaningful, and continued improvement was observed with time. 
The AIMS subscale scores evaluated at 12- and 24-months post eladocagene exuparvovec 
administration showed a similar pattern to PDMS-2 subscale scores in that they increased from 
baseline and were consistent with the 60-month data. LS Mean AIMS subscale scores at 24 months

Neurologic Examination Findings 
Eladocagene exuparvovec therapy was associated with improvement in neurologic performance, 
including reduction in number of patients with floppiness, OGC episodes, dystonia, and stimulus-
provoked dystonia. Most patients had neurologic examination findings at baseline, with floppiness (13 
patients [68.4%]), OGC episodes (15 patients [78.9%]), limb dystonia (15 patients [78.9%]), and 
stimulus-provoked dystonia (7 patients [36.8%]) present. Overall, the proportion of patients with 
neurologic exam findings decreased upon treatment. The most marked improvements were seen in 
floppiness and dystonias, with no events of stimulus-provoked dystonia observed from evaluable 
patients after Month 3. 
Muscle Power and DTR Response 
Muscle power was assessed using a 6-point scale in 4 muscle groups (muscle power group I [right 
upper extremity], II [left upper extremity], III [right lower extremity], and IV [left lower extremity]). 
Patients were assigned scores that ranged from 1, indicating no movement, to 6, indicating normal 
movement. No patients demonstrated the ability of a muscle group to overcome resistance of the 
examiner (normal muscle strength, response 6) for any of the muscle power groups at 1 month after 
eladocagene exuparvovec administration. Twelve months after eladocagene exuparvovec 
administration, some patients developed normal strength in upper and lower extremities (1 patient 
[4.8%] in muscle power group I, 2 patients [7.7%] in muscle power groups II and III, and 3 patients 
[11.5%] in muscle power group IV). At 12 months post gene therapy, no patient had response <3 in 
any of the muscle groups evaluated, indicating they all had developed some ability to use muscle 
groups in their arm or leg. On average, over the 12-month period following eladocagene exuparvovec 
administration, patients also developed the ability to move the upper arm against some resistance 
from the examiner (response 5) (7 patients [26.9%] for muscle power I and II). Similarly, 6 patients 
(23.1%, for muscle power III) and 7 patients (26.9%, for muscle power IV) developed the ability to 
move a lower extremity against some resistance from the examiner. 
Figure 27 Summary statistics for muscle power are presented below. 
Improvement in Body Weight 
Increase in body weight is a positive indicator for AADC-deficient patients, who typically exhibit feeding 
and swallowing problems as well as gastrointestinal problems throughout life, which may contribute to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 92/132 
 
 
 
 
nutritional absorption deficiencies and low body weight. Bodyweight increased from baseline for the 
majority of patients at Month 12. 
Cognitive Development 
Cognitive development was evaluated using the CDIIT in Study AADC-CU/1601 and the Bayley-III 
instrument in Studies AADC-010 and AADC-011. Across all 3 studies, eladocagene exuparvovec was 
associated with clinically meaningful improvement compared with natural history control in cognitive 
function.  
Measures of Neurotransmitter Metabolite Activity 
Neurochemistry measurements of HVA and 5-HIAA in CSF, as downstream metabolites of dopamine 
and serotonin production, respectively, are objective measurements of de novo neurotransmitter 
production in the brain and support that the clinical benefit patients obtained in motor function over 
time. At baseline, the concentrations of both metabolites were near or below the lower limit of 
quantitation in patients with AADC deficiency, indicating little or no AADC enzyme activity. The CSF 
concentration of HVA at 12 months after treatment was increased from baseline. Few patients showed 
increased CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA at 12 months, which is not unexpected given the targeted 
region of the brain (putamen) does not contain serotonergic neurons. 
Putaminal-Specific Uptake 
Measurement of 18F-DOPA uptake in the putamen via PET imaging following treatment demonstrated 
that eladocagene exuparvovec therapy is associated with de novo dopamine synthesis in the brain and 
that dopamine production is maintained over extended periods of time. 
Most patients in the eladocagene exuparvovec clinical trials demonstrated generally continuous 
increases in putaminal-specific uptake over time. An increase was evident as early as 6 months after 
treatment (4 patients evaluated; mean change from baseline [SD] 0.25 [0.38]), was further increased 
at 12 months (16 patients, mean change from baseline 0.27[0.25]) and 24 months (8 patients, mean 
change from baseline 0.47 [0.22]), and sustained up to 60 months (2 patients, mean change from 
baseline 0.42 [0.09]).At the 24-month time-point (n=8), the LS mean 18F-DOPA-specific uptake was 
0.7, 95% CI 0.5, 0.8; at the 60-month time-point (n=2), the LS mean 18F-DOPA -specific uptake was 
0.6, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8. 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
Analyses for the primary endpoint (motor milestone acquisition at Month 24) and select secondary 
endpoints (PDMS-2 and AIMS total scores) were conducted in the FAS population to determine whether 
a particular subgroup within the study population of patients with AADC deficiency received preferential 
treatment benefit than the overall study population. Subpopulations of gender and age at eladocagene 
exuparvovec administration were analysed in patients from both dose groups. Results presented in this 
study include patients who received the 1.8 ×1011 vg dose. 
Subgroup Analysis by Gender

Page 93/132 
 
 
 
Clinically meaningful improvement in head control, sitting unassisted, and standing with support was 
seen in all patients who received gene therapy, independent of gender. 
Secondary Endpoints 
As previously described, clinically meaningful improvements in PDMS-2 and AIMS were observed in all 
eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients. Analysis of PDMS-2 total scores at Month 24 by gender 
showed similar mean increases from baseline in males (102.4, 95% CI 31.6, 173.2) and females 
(96.7, 95% CI 59.1, 134.2). Similarly, the mean increase from baseline in AIMS scores at Month 24 
was the same in males (24.4, 95% CI 2.6, 46.2) and females (23.9, 95% CI 11.7, 36.0). 
Subgroup Analysis by Age 
Primary Analysis: Acquisition of Key Motor Milestones 
Clinically meaningful improvement in head control, sitting unassisted, and standing with support was 
seen in all patients who received gene therapy, independent of age. 
Figure 28 Key Motor Milestone Acquisition at Month 24 by Age at Time of Gene Therapy - 
(FAS Population) 
Secondary Endpoints 
When comparing age at time of treatment, only 1 patient received eladocagene exuparvovec treatment 
at <2 years of age. However, analysis of the 2 to <6-year age group compared with the 6 to <12-year 
age group suggests that although clinically meaningful improvements were observed in both 
subgroups, earlier administration may be more advantageous. The mean change from baseline in the 
PDMS-2 total score at Month 24 was almost double in the 2 to <6 year age group (111.1, 95% CI 
70.1, 152.1) than what was observed in the 6 to <12 year age group (65.6, 95% CI 25.1, 106.1) 
although these findings are limited by the small sample size and high variability. Similar results were 
observed with AIMS, where the mean change from baseline at Month 24 was 30.0 (95% CI 15.8, 44.2) 
in the 2 to <6-year age group and 13.4 (95% CI 3.4, 23.4) in the 6 to <12-year age group. 
Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations 
Analysis of the 2.4×1011 vg Dose 
In Studies AADC-010 and AADC-011, a dilution step was required to obtain the desired dose of 
1.8×1011 vg. In Study AADC-011, patients younger than 3 years received undiluted vector (2.4×1011 
vg, 5 patients). The dilution step was removed for logistical purposes. The removal of the dilution step 
did not cause an increase in dose that is expected to be clinically different than the 1.8×1011 dose. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 94/132 
 
 
 
 
increase in dose after removal of the dilution step is approximately 30%, which is not a meaningful 
increase in a gene therapy product, where dose changes usually require log increases. 
Overall, both doses of eladocagene exuparvovec provided clinical benefit to AADC-deficient patients. 
Improvements in patients who received the 2.4×1011 vg dose were similar to those patients of the 
same age who received the 1.8×1011 vg dose. 
Efficacy at the 2.4×1011 vg Dose 
Efficacy results for the 1.8×1011 and 2.4×1011 vg groups are similar, indicating that the dose change 
did not affect the efficacy of gene therapy. The proportion of patients who achieved motor milestones 
in the 2.4×1011 vg dose group was similar to the 1.8×1011 dose group. 
Figure 29 Key Motor Milestone Acquisition at Month 12 at Time of Gene Therapy – 
2.4×1011 vg Dose (ITT Population) 
In patients in the 2.4×1011 vg dose group, increases in both PDMS-2 and AIMS total scores (signifying 
improvement) were observed at the first assessment at 3 months post-infusion and scores continued 
to improve with each 3-month assessment. Improvements were similar to those observed in patients 
of similar age in the 1.8×1011 vg dose group. 
Subgroup Analysis at the 2.4×1011 vg Dose 
Although the number of patients in each age and gender subgroup who received 2.4×1011 vg 
eladocagene exuparvovec was too small to allow conclusions to be drawn, key motor milestone 
acquisition results appeared similar to those observed in the 1.8×1011 vg dose group. 
No statistical analyses were performed on the 2.4×1011 vg dose group due to the small number of 
patients (n=4 for patients with 12-month data). 
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
Importantly, key motor milestone acquisition continued beyond the primary efficacy assessment at the 
24-month time point, with a total of 10 patients (62.5%) achieving head control, 7 patients (43.8%) 
sitting unassisted, 2 patients (12.5%) standing with support, and 1 patient (6.25%) walking with 
assistance at the 36-month time point. Also, an additional patient was able to sit unassisted at Month 
48 (patient 1002 from Study AADC-010), and one patient, who had achieved the 3 motor milestones of 
head control, sitting unassisted, and standing with support by Month 18, was able to walk with 
assistance at Month 36 (patient 1004 from Study AADC-010). These data support the persistence of 
efficacy for eladocagene exuparvovec, as acquisition of new motor milestones is dependent on the 
mastery and maintenance of previous milestones. Motor milestone acquisition not only continues 
throughout the ongoing follow-up, it is durable. At Month 24, 10 patients achieved head control and 7 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 95/132 
 
 
 
 
patients achieved sitting unassisted; all milestones were sustained by each patient at each visit after 
the 24-month time point. To date, no eladocagene exuparvovec-treated patients have achieved 
milestones and subsequently lost the abilities they achieved. 
Further to this, continued improvement of motor milestone acquisition has been observed over a 60-
month (5 year) follow-up period. Of the 8 evaluable patients at the 60-monthtimepoint, 4 patients 
(50%) had achieved head control and sitting unassisted and 2 patients (25%) could stand with 
support. 
2.6.5.4.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study AADC-011 
The objective of this Phase 2b, open-label prospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
intraputaminal infusion of eladocagene exuparvovec in children with AADC deficiency for a period of up 
to 1 year after study drug administration in order to: 
•  give those patients who were not enrolled in the Phase 1/2 trial (i.e. AADC-010) an opportunity 
for treatment 
• 
• 
increase experience in gene therapy for AADC deficiency 
increase the dosage slightly in patients younger than 3 years of age 
Methods 
Study participants  
Eight (8) patients were enrolled in the study and received eladocagene exuparvovec infusion at the 
time of data cut-off (27 March 2019). All subjects were recruited at a single hospital centre in Taiwan, 
which specialises in the treatment of children with AADC deficiency. 
Results 
Disposition of Patients 
Three (3) patients (37.5%) were enrolled in the 1.8×1011vg dose group and 5 patients (62.5%) were 
enrolled in the 2.4×1011vg dose group, for a total of 8 patients. One patient (Patient 302) was 
considered a screen failure due to the occurrence of an SAE of bronchopneumonia. This patient was 
subsequently rescreened and enrolled into the study as Patient 305.

Figure 30 Patient Completion Data 
Seven (7) of the 8 patients (87.5%) completed the study through Month 12. One patient (Patient 309, 
2.4x1011 vg group) remains in follow-up, having completed 6 months of follow up at the time of data 
cut off. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration of follow-up was 11.5 (2.21) months. 
Demographics 
For all patients, the median age at baseline was 28.5 months (range 21.0 to 70.0 months). The 
median age at diagnosis was 11.0 months (range 1.0 to 28.0 months). Five (5) patients (62.5%) were 
male and 3 patients (37.5%) were female. All patients were Asian (6 patients were Asian-Chinese, and 
2 patients were Asian-Other) and all patients carried the founder mutation (3 patients were 
homozygous and 5 patients were heterozygous). A listing of demographics by patient is provided.

Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Of note, use of dopaminergic agents for AADC deficiency was recorded for 6 patients, 75.0%. In all 6 
patients, dopaminergic agents were taken prior to eladocagene exuparvovec infusion as standard of 
care for AADC and were not continued after the surgical procedure. Two patients continued taking 
Neupro for up to 3 months after the infusion.

Outcomes and estimation 
Figure 32 Number and Proportion of Patients Achieving Key Motor Milestones 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
PDMS-2 
All patients showed improvement in motor skills and developmental milestones as assessed by the 
PDMS-2 and shown for the PDMS-2 total score for each patient. An increase in total score (signifying 
improvement) was observed at the first assessment at 3 months post-infusion and scores continued to 
improve with each 3-month assessment. 
AIMS 
An increase in AIMS total score (signifying improvement) was observed at the first assessment at 3 
months post-infusion and scores continued to improve with each 3-month assessment. Change from 
baseline data for AIMS total and subscale scores as assessed by fixed effect of visit, age (months) at 
gene therapy administration. Increases from baseline in all mean AIMS subscale scores were observed 
at Month 12. 
Cognitive Language Development: Bayley-III 
All patients showed improvement in cognitive, language, and expressive communication as assessed 
by the Bayley-III scales. An increase in total score (signifying improvement) was usually observed at 
the first assessment at 3 months post-infusion and scores continued to improve with each 3-month 
assessment. The increase from baseline in mean Bayley-III total score was statistically significant at 
Month 12 based on a repeated measures analysis that tested fixed effects. Increases from baseline in 
mean Bayley-III subscale scores were also observed at Month 12, with the largest improvements seen 
in the cognitive domain. 
Body Weight 
Body weight increased from baseline to Month 12 in both dose groups, with a transient decrease 
observed between Month 3 and Month 6 in the 1.8x1011vg dose group. Mean body weight increased 
by an average of 1.77 kg from baseline to Month 12 for patients in the 1.8x1011vg dose group and an 
average of 3.20 kg for patients in the 2.4x1011vg dose group 
Neurologic Examination Findings 
Following treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec, the number of patients with floppiness, OGC 
episodes, and limb dystonia decreased from baseline to Month 12. Immunogenicity 
Anti-AAV2 antibody data  
At 3 months post infusion was reported for 5 patients, 3 patients receiving 1.8×1011 vg and 2 patients 
receiving 2.4×1011 vg. The presence of anti-AAV2 antibodies was detected in all 5 patients at Month 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

3. At Month 6, data reported for 4 patients showed that antibody titres were generally decreasing. 
Only1patient had an evaluation at Month 9; their antibody titre remained stable from Month 6 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
Change from Baseline in Neurotransmitter Metabolites The presence of the dopamine metabolite HVA 
was measured in CSF. For patients receiving a dose of 1.8×1011 vg, the concentration of HVA at 
Month 12 was approximately double the concentration at baseline. Individual patient data shows that 
HVA concentrations increased from baseline to Month 12 for all patients. For 2 of the 3 patients in the 
1.8x1011vg dose group, a decrease in 5-HIAA levels was observed from baseline to Month 12, with the 
remaining patient in this group showing no change in 5-HIAA levels.  
Putaminal-specific Uptake by PET Imaging 
For patients receiving a dose of 1.8×1011 vg, mean putaminal-specific uptake on PET imaging was 
relatively unchanged during the study. 
Figure 33 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The aim of the therapy is to increase dopamine product in this area of the brain to improve motor 
development. Significant gross motor milestone at this age (from 0 to 2 years) include, head control, 
sitting unassisted, standing and walking. Achievement of any one of these milestones assessed by a 
standardised method (as described in the assessment of validated PDMS-2 scale) meets the primary 
efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints used include movement scales PDMS-2 & AIMS scores which 
are validated early motor development scales designed to assess gross and fine motor skills in children 
from birth to 5 years Peabody Developmental Motor Scale(PDMS-2) & 0-18 months or independent 
walking for the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). Neither scale is validated for use in AADC but there 
are no paediatric scores validated to assess motor development in this population. 
These endpoints & study design were the subject of scientific advice and paediatric investigation plan. 
The applicant has not performed a dose finding study. It is accepted that a dose finding study in such 
an ultra-rare condition may not be possible. Due to the rare & severe nature of the disease, 
neurosurgical application of this active and single administration, the applicant wanted to administer a 
therapeutic dose in the phase 1/CU(compassionate use) trial. The applicant has based the dose for the 
phase 1 trial on preclinical studies with a similar active in non-human primates and on previous studies 
in human adults. This is in line with the Guideline on the quality, preclinical and clinical requirements of 
gene therapy medicinal products EMA/CAT/80183/2019. Therefore, the dose finding study and phase 1 
clinical trial are performed as a single study. 
The applicant based the dose for the phase 1 study on a proof of concept study in non-human primates 
where doses from 6×10 to 5×1011 vg were administered and in whom enzyme saturation occurred at 
a dose of 1.7×1011 vg.  The dose was also based on data from human studies using a similar vector 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

for Parkinson’s disease. Doses of an rAAV2 vector of up to 3x1011 vg via bilateral putamen dosing 
have been used in Parkinson’s disease studies. The target population and disease pathology are 
different in subjects with Parkinson’s disease. However, the studies do give information about the 
mode & volume of administration & the potential safety risks of the active. Based on the relative 
average mass of a child brain (1000 g) being approximately 60% that of an adult brain (1350 g), and 
using brain weight scaling to a child brain, the dose of 1.8×1011vg of eladocagene exuparvovec used 
in the AADC clinical trials in children is equal to approximately 60% of the highest dose used in 
Parkinson’s disease clinical trials in adults, which again was well tolerated. 
Response was observed in patients treated at the dose for the phase 1/CU trial, so this dose was 
chosen for the subsequent clinical development. Whilst dose finding and dose confirmation is not 
optimal for this active, the rationale for the chosen dose based on the POC study and data in human 
adults is accepted. 
The applicant did treat 5 subjects with a higher dose in study AADC-011. The justification for this was 
the removal of a dilution step. The response in the group treated at the higher dose appears to be 
similar to that in subjects treated at the lower dose. 
Of note, the dose finding study was performed with drug manufactured with process A and not the 
commercially manufactured process. There is no safety or efficacy data available for the commercially 
manufactured product & comparability has not been established against process A product to confirm 
dose equivalence of the commercial product. Differences in the manufacturing process are outlined in 
the quality sections of the report. 
At the time of original submission, efficacy results were presented for 3 studies AADC-CU/1601, AADC-
010 & AADC011. One study is completed AADC-CU/1601. Two of the studies are ongoing AAD-010 & 
AADC-011. Data from 21 patients treated at the proposed therapeutic dose was included in the original 
submission. A further 5 subjects were treated at a higher (30%) dose.  
Updated efficacy and safety data was submitted throughout the two year procedure. Efficacy Data from 
an additional two subjects was included in the applicant’s responses during the procedure therefore 
data on 28 subjects is presented in the updated integrated efficacy analysis at the time of marketing 
authorisation decision. 
The database is small but this is a very rare orphan condition. Two of the studies are ongoing but data 
for up to 5 years is available for some subjects.  
The population studied were children aged between 18 months and 8 years and 6 months. There were 
no adults or adolescents treated in the clinical trials. Only children with a severe phenotype were 
included in the clinical trials and there is no data to support a benefit in children with a mild or 
moderate phenotype who may achieve motor milestones spontaneously or respond to treatment with 
current standard of care. 
All clinical studies were open label single-arm studies, using external historical control data as control.  
There have been no GCP inspections conducted at the site. Each study report contains a statement 
that the study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practices including the archiving of 
essential documents. All studies were conducted at a single site outside Europe i.e. in Taiwan where 
the founder mutation for AADC was described & where the disease is more prevalent and there is 
expertise in its diagnosis and management. 
 A request for GCP inspection was made at the time of submission of the MAA. However due to the risk 
of Covid19 in the area, onsite GCP inspections in the affected areas could not be requested at this 
time. An onsite inspection was not considered possible due to the visa and quarantine restrictions. It

was considered that a virtual inspection may not be adequate to review the patient documentation at 
the trial site. 
There is no experience from the CT programme on treating European patients with this product.  
The historical control cohort used to contextualise the clinical trials results was based on the published 
literature review of all available reported AADC deficiency cases, which was performed by Wassenberg 
et al (Wassenberg 2017). This review identified 117 confirmed AADC deficiency cases, of which 103 
had sufficient information to adjudicate severity. From these 103 cases, a total of 82 AADC-deficient 
patients were considered as having a severe phenotype, which was comparable to the patients enrolled 
in the 3 eladocagene exuparvovec clinical studies and therefore was utilized as the natural history 
control (Wassenberg 2017).  
The limitation of a historic control based on literature is that it is difficult to match patients in the 
treated and control groups in terms of age, genotype & baseline scores on PDMS-2 & AIMS. It is not 
clear from the publication by Wassenberg et al whether the characteristics of the external control 
population i.e. age, genotype or phenotype match that of the subjects in the clinical trials treated with 
the active.  
Hwu et al 2017 also published a study of the Natural history of a cohort of 37 subjects with AADC 
treated in Taiwan National University hospital. Some of these subjects went on to be treated in the 
Gene Therapy programme in Taiwan. More detail is available about this cohort of subjects in terms of 
age, genotype, phenotype, PDMS, AIMS & Bayley scores. This group may be a better match for the 
treated group but are taken from the same population as subjects treated in the clinical trial 
programme. A comparison with the group described by Wassenburg et al reflects worldwide experience 
and consensus about the clinical presentation and diagnosis of AADC.   
In response to major objection relating to the natural history comparator group, the applicant 
established a natural history database from a review of all publications of patients treated with a 
confirmed diagnosis of AADC. From this database the applicant selected patients that matched the 
treatment group for phenotype. There were 49 subjects identified with a severe phenotype similar to 
those treated in the clinical development programme. Subjects described by Hwu et al in his 
publication who were not treated with gene therapy were included in this group.  The applicant used 
data from this group as the comparator in the assessment of the efficacy endpoints. Of the 49 subjects 
identified with a similar phenotype 47 i.e. 95% did not achieve an improvement in milestones with 
standard of care. Two subjects achieved a response, 1 was able to roll from side to side, the other able 
to walk with assistance. Rolling from side to side was not a milestone agreed a priori for the primary 
efficacy endpoint analysis. While the applicant has provided more clinical & demographic data about 
this population in the NHDB, the data is taken from publications and while it can be used to 
contextualise the results the comparison was not considered robust enough for statistical comparison 
particularly with such a small sample size.  
Protocol deviations were not explicitly collected in AADC-CU or in observational study AADC-CU/1601. 
For study AADC-010, all patients received treatment in accordance with the study protocol. No patient 
had any deviation that affected the validity of the data or the conclusions of the analysis. A total of 42 
protocol deviations were reported; the primary reasons were missing data from postsurgical 
procedures (27) and time window deviations (7). A total of 17 protocol deviations were reported in 
Study AADC-011, 8 patients during the study. Five (5) protocol deviations were due to time window 
deviations. Five (5) deviations were due to drug storage conditions out of specified range. In addition, 
1 patient (Patient 301) used prohibited medications more than 1 month after gene therapy; 1 patient 
missed the brain CT post-surgery due to the SAE of bradycardia (unlikely to be related to study drug); 
and 1 patient had an insufficient glucose sample.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Data in support of efficacy was submitted from 3 clinical trials in children aged 18 moths to 8 years. On 
initial submission, the primary endpoint of reaching a motor milestone was reached in 9 (50%) of the 
ITT population. Seven (7)38.9% subjects were able to sit unassisted, and 2 (11.1%) were able to 
stand with support.  
There was a significant benefit to treatment with Upstaza in some subjects compared to the natural 
history of the disease as described in the control group. The control group with severe phenotype are 
described as having ‘poor head control’ & achieved no other motor milestones such as sitting 
unassisted, standing or walking. Deterioration with loss of skills is described in some patients but in 
the majority of cases, there is no evident progressive clinical course with loss of function described.  
Some clarifications were requested to confirm that the observed benefit was due to the active.  Some 
subjects were started on dopaminergic agents after treatment with the IMP in the clinical trial. It was 
not clear initially whether these patients responded better to treatment i.e. achieved a motor milestone 
with the gene therapy or what the indication for restarting treatment with the dopaminergic agent was. 
According to Wassenberg et al positive responses have been reported with some Dopaminergic agents. 
The applicant provided updated data on milestone achievement in children who had been treated with 
dopamine agonists to control symptoms and there was no additional benefit in terms of milestone 
achievement to subjects treated with DA after gene therapy. 
Some of the treatment group had symptoms of AADC after 12 months of age, The applicant has 
provided data in relation to baseline motor function in this group and no children had achieved a 
milestone prior to treatment with the gene therapy so would not have biased the results. 
Patients continued to gain motor function after the time point of 24 months. For those who attained 
motor skills the gain was maintained up to 60 months. In some children additional milestones were 
achieved after the primary efficacy assessment. In the initial dataset presented three (3) patients 
obtained full head control, 2 achieved the ability to sit unassisted, 1 to stand with support & 1 patient 
was able to walk with assistance. At the data cut –off date in March 2019, eight (8) children who did 
not respond within the time point of the primary efficacy endpoint, showed a response. In study, 
AADC011 at 12 months, four subjects had achieved head control. On request the applicant presented 
an updated efficacy analysis including all patients treated in the three clinical trials who achieved 
milestones up to & after the time-point of the primary efficacy analysis to get an overview of the 
benefit to subjects after the 24-month time-point of the primary efficacy analysis. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints showed a similar trend. All subjects showed an increase in PDMS 
score over time and this increase was greater for subjects treated at a younger age. The mean change 
in baseline PDMS-2 score at 24 months was 94.3 (95% CI 75.6-112.9). The scores continued to 
increase to 60 months. The change in score reflected increases in scores for grasping, locomotion, 
object manipulation and visual-motor integration. The AIMS score showed a similar trend with all 
subjects achieving an increase in score after treatment & a mean increase at 24 months of 21.9 (95% 
CI 16.1-27.6). Compared to baseline score the increases were statistically significant but were also 
clinically relevant. 
Clinical benefit was also associated with improved neurological performance mainly in the area of 
floppiness, dystonia and stimulus provoked dystonia. Body weight increased from baseline in the 
majority of patients but it is unclear what the improvement was due to i.e. improved swallowing, 
increased appetite etc. There was no beneficial effect reported on symptoms related to serotonin 
deficiency or other autonomic symptoms of the disease. 
Uncertainties regarding the dataset include the small size of the dataset. All studies were conducted at 
a centre in Taiwan outside the EEA. The founder mutation for the disease was discovered there. There

was only one Caucasian patient in the treated population. Although the underlying pathology of the 
disease, enzyme defect, clinical phenotype and natural course of the disease appears to be similar for 
the European population, the external validity of the results for a European population had not been 
discussed by the applicant at the time of the day 120 assessment report. In their responses the 
applicant provided data regarding the known prevalence of the disease in Europe and the genotypes 
and clinical phenotypes described in the European population. It is likely that the benefits observed in 
the European population would be similar to those observed in the clinical trial population. The AHEG 
agreed with this conclusion. 
Other uncertainties with the data relate to the extrapolation of the indication to older children and 
adults. There were no children aged nine or over or adults treated in the clinical trials. All subjects 
treated in the clinical trials had the severe phenotype of disease. The initially proposed indication did 
not reflect the population studied in the clinical trial development programme. There is no explicit data 
to establish the benefit risk in these older populations. However, based on the expert feedback, CAT 
agreed that the indication can be extended to older age groups.  
There is limited clinical data submitted to confirm efficacy with the commercially manufactured 
product. The quality comparability exercise conducted to determine whether there were any 
differences in quality of the products manufactured by process A, B and the commercial process C was 
limited by the amount of material available from product manufactured using process A and B. For this 
reason comparability cannot be concluded between process A and process B material.  The 
comparability exercise conducted using process C material was also limited to 1 batch. 
Additional expert consultation 
The Ad Hoc expert group was convened to discuss the following questions: 
1. Do you consider that the effects seen after treatment with Upstaza in the clinical studies are 
clinically meaningful? 
Summary of AHEG response -The experts agreed that the current standard pharmacological treatment 
is not sufficient and there is high unmet medical need. The improvements seen in clinical trials varied 
between age and severity groups but were judged to be clinically meaningful. Some experts noted that 
the effects were only partial as the selected route of administration was not optimal and midbrain 
delivery would likely yield better results. 
2. Do you think that the children who have achieved head control but have not achieved other motor 
milestones would benefit from treatment with Upstaza. 
Summary of AHEG response-The experts noted that, from the clinical point of view, a patient who 
achieved head control and no other milestones would be still categorised as severely affected. There 
are no clinical arguments to exclude these patients from the treatment. Even small improvements can 
be meaningful from the point of view of patients and carers. Examples of improvements in mood 
control, oculogyric crisis or weight gain were given as important for the Quality of Life outcomes. 
3. Do you consider that very severely affected children defined in terms of the presence of 
contractures, no voluntary movements or need for permanent ventilation should expect to benefit from 
treatment. 
Summary of AHEG response- The experts notes that patients with these baseline characteristics were 
not included in the clinical trials.  However, they could still benefit from the treatment and gain 
potential improvement in sleep or feeding, even if motor development remained unaffected. It was 
noted that surgery in these patients may be challenging and carry additional risks, especially with 
regards to intubation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 103/132 
 
 
 
4. Do you think that there are any specific considerations or patient characteristics that will help to 
identify children that may benefit more from treatment. 
Summary of AHEG response-The experts observed that the treatment effect tends to be more 
pronounced in children who are younger and in those who already experienced some improvement 
following dopaminergic treatment. Apart from those, there are no other identified characteristic which 
would act as predictor for response to treatment.   
The experts noted that this type of data is of importance to be collected. 
5. What is your view on the safety profile of the product, the risks of administration and potential 
longer term effects. 
Summary of AHEG response-The experts were of the opinion that the safety profile seems to be 
generally acceptable. However, majority of the data were collected in one highly experienced centre. it 
is possible that the number of adverse events related to the surgical procedure could increase once 
more centres are allowed to administer Upstaza. The experts have recommended that comprehensive 
training and supervision program should be developed.  
A close follow-up to characterise long term safety and efficacy (preferably integrated in the INTD 
registry) is also expected.  
The frequent GI adverse events are likely not connected to the Upstaza administration but result from 
the underlaying disease 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
To further characterise long-term efficacy and safety (as missing information) of the commercial product, 
10-year follow-up data from study AADC-1602 and a registry-based study is requested, which should 
include  the  relevant  efficacy  endpoints  such  as  motor  behavioural  development,  as  well  as  safety 
endpoints.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The dataset is limited. The main benefit attained by 24 months in approximately half the population 
treated is the achievement of head control. Most subjects who gained head control went on to achieve 
other milestones after 24 months. There is no observed effect on autonomic symptoms of the disease 
and limited effects on serotonergic symptoms of the disease. The clinical relevance of the motor 
benefits of treatment compared to the risk of neurosurgery was discussed with an AHEG who 
supported that efficacy has been demonstrated and is clinically meaningful.  
The applicant was asked to consider whether it is possible to identify subjects who may respond better 
to treatment & achieve unassisted sitting, standing or walking. Whilst there were no factors identified 
that would predict a better response, subjects treated at a younger age seemed to have a greater 
response indicated by a greater increase in PDMS score.  
The additional benefits to treatment claimed by the applicant include a decrease in the annualized rate 
of upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. The percentage of subjects with episodes of RTI 
decreases from 90% approx. at year 1 to 27% at year 5. This is a clinically relevant change in rate of 
respiratory infections. However, the data is difficult to interpret without the baseline rate of URTI in the 
treated population.  The applicant also presents data regarding improvements for all subjects in OGC 
events, body weight, language and cognition and fine motor movement that does not occur 
spontaneously in this patient population with severe disease. The clinical relevance of the described 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 104/132 
 
 
 
benefits was not clear from the data submitted. The clinical relevance of the observed effects and how 
they relate to improved quality of life for patients also was not clear. These observed benefits must be 
viewed in the context of the limitations to the data, risks and potential risks of the active & the 
neurosurgery involved in the administration of the active.  
In the opinion of the CAT the observed motor benefits could not be extrapolated to other populations 
such as subjects with a milder phenotype. In view of the existing medical need beyond the population 
covered by the granted indication, the applicant is strongly encouraged to pursue the clinical 
development of Upstaza in patients with less severe disease, to both enlarge the safety database and 
cover the critical medical need.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
To further characterise long-term efficacy and safety (as missing information) of the commercial product 
10-year follow-up data from study AADC-1602 and a registry-based study is requested, which should 
include  the  relevant  efficacy  endpoints  such  as  motor  behavioural  development,  as  well  as  safety 
endpoints.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
All patients received intraputaminal infusions of eladocagene exuparvovec during a single operative 
procedure, with infusions to 2 sites in the right putamen and 2 sites in the left putamen. Twenty-one 
patients received a total dose of 1.8x1011 vg. Five patients received a total dose of 2.4x1011 vg. 
On initial submission, twenty-five patients completed 12 months of follow-up after the surgical 
procedure, and 17 patients completed 24 months of follow-up. Ten patients are still ongoing, 9 
patients in Study AADC-010 (planned follow-up of 5 years) and 1 patient in Study AADC-011 (planned 
follow-up of 12 months). The ongoing patient in Study AADC-011 has been in follow-up for 6 months 
after receiving eladocagene exuparvovec 2.4x1011 vg. All patients in Study AADC-CU/1601 (n=8) have 
completed the planned 5-year follow-up.

All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Dyskinesia was recorded for 24 patients (92.3%; 
Section 3.1.1.1) and was considered related to treatment for 23 patients (88.5%). Ten patients 
(38.5%) experienced an AE that was severe in intensity, and 23 patients (88.5%) experienced an SAE. 
Two patients died: 1 patient died 12 months after the surgical procedure due to bacterial encephalitis

Figure 35 Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Dose Group and Overall, 
Safety Population (n=26) 
2.6.8.3.  Common Adverse Events 
TEAEs by Incidence 
Pyrexia and dyskinesia were the most commonly reported AEs, being reported by over 90% of 
patients. As dopamine levels are non-existent to low prior to gene therapy, the occurrence of 
dyskinesia is an expected event and can be attributed to hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors to 
newly available dopamine. All events of dyskinesia resolved within 7 months of clinical onset, and most 
resolved within 4 months of gene therapy. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity; 
The majority of events were possibly/probably related to eladocagene exuparvovec. 
Upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia were the next most commonly 
occurring events and were reported by 65% to 69% of patients. 
The incidence of commonly reported AEs appeared to be similar between the 1.8x1011 and 2.4x1011 vg 
dose groups. Breath sounds were abnormal in all 5 patients (100%) in the 2.4x1011 vg dose group, 
which is not surprising given that respiratory complications are common in this patient population, but 
was reported for only 14.3% of patients in the 1.8x1011 vg dose group. Another difference between 
doses was in the occurrence of cyanosis, experienced by 33.3% of patients in the 1.8x1011 vg dose 
group and by 0% of patients in the 2.4x1011 vg dose group. 
2.6.8.4.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Adverse events that were severe in intensity 
were experienced by 10 patients (38.5%). Gastroenteritis (n=3) and pneumonia (n=4) were the only 
AEs that were reported by more than 1 or 2 patients. Only 1 patient in the 2.4x1011 vg dose group 
experienced an event (respiratory failure) that was severe in intensity. 
TEAEs by Relatedness 
Dyskinesia was the most commonly occurring adverse event that was considered to be related to 
treatment and was experienced by nearly all patients (23 patients, 88.5%). Aside from dyskinesia, 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 107/132 
 
 
 
 
other AEs were considered treatment-related: initial insomnia, salivary hypersecretion, feeding 
disorder, sleep disorder. 
TEAEs by Time 
The majority of AEs (380/513 events, 74.1%) occurred within the first 12 months following gene 
therapy treatment. All patients experienced AEs within this timeframe. The most frequently occurring 
events (pyrexia and dyskinesia) tended to occur in the first 12 months. All AEs considered to be related 
to treatment occurred within the first 12 months. 
Twenty-four patients fell into the Month 12 to Month 24 follow-up period. Seventeen patients (70.8%) 
reported AEs between Month 12 and Month 24, but the total number of events reported was low 
(56/513 events, 10.9%). After Month 24, 17 patients remained in follow-up. Of these, 13 patients 
(76.5%) reported 77/513 (15.0%) AEs over the next 3 years. 
Adverse events that were reported only between Month 12 to Month 24 or only after Month 24 were 
generally reported by 1 patient each, and are unlikely to be the result of latent, long-term effects of 
gene therapy. Adverse events that were reported only between Month 12 to Month 24 include 
polydactyly, allergic otitis media, hypermetropia, gastrointestinal motility disorder, hiatus hernia, croup 
infectious, irregular sleep phase, and peptic ulcer. Adverse events that were reported only after Month 
24 include sinus bradycardia, functional gastrointestinal disorder, esophagitis, tooth loss, mass, 
herpangina, influenza, hyponatremia, foot deformity, knee deformity, scoliosis, aphasia, hypoglycemic 
seizure, genital swelling, asthma, sleep apnoea syndrome, contact dermatitis, pallor, acute 
osteomyelitis, inguinal hernia, and cholesteatoma.

(N=26) 
2.6.8.5.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Two of the 26 patients in the integrated safety database have died: 
One patient, a boy who was treated at 32 months of age, experienced a severe SAE of encephalopathy 
(encephalitis due to influenza B) approximately 11 months after study treatment in Study AADC-010 
(ISS Listing 6). The patient died due to the encephalopathy after 12 months of follow-up. The infection 
and death were considered unrelated to eladocagene exuparvovec. 
One patient, a boy who was treated at 53 months of age, died 4 months after the 5-year follow-up 
period in Study AADC-CU/1601 was completed. The cause of death, when the patient was nearly 10 
years old, was considered to be related to underlying AADC disease and unlikely related to treatment 
with eladocagene exuparvovec.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Twenty-three patients (88.5%) experienced a SAE. Pneumonia (13 patients, 50.0%) and 
gastroenteritis (11 patients, 42.3%) were the most frequently occurring SAEs.

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Surgical Related AEs 
Ten patients experienced adverse events potentially related to the surgical procedure. Four events 
occurred on the same day as the surgical procedure: post-operative skull defect (mild), endotracheal 
intubation complication (severe), subcutaneous hematoma (mild), and transfusion reaction (mild). All 
events of hypotension (2 moderate, 4 mild) occurred on the day of or the day after the surgical 
procedure. Skin injury (verbatim term: left parietal scalp swelling, mild) started the day after surgery 
and wound complication (verbatim term: surgery wound swelling; moderate) occurred approximately 1 
month afterwards. All of these events were considered unrelated or unlikely to be treatment-related 
and all events resolved.

Population (N=26) 
Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak 
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks were rarely reported during clinical trials of eladocagene exuparvovec. Three 
patients experienced leakage of CSF: 
Patient 1601-06 experienced 1 moderate SAE and 1 mild SAE of CSF leak approximately 1 month and 
5 months after eladocagene exuparvovec infusion, respectively. Both events required hospitalization 
but were considered unlikely to be related to eladocagene exuparvovec and resolved.  
Patient 010-1001 experienced a mild AE of CSF leak approximately 3 weeks following eladocagene 
exuparvovec infusion. The event was mild, considered unrelated to treatment, and resolved without 
intervention. 
Patient 010-1004 experienced a mild AE of CSF leak approximately 5 months after eladocagene 
exuparvovec infusion. The event was mild, considered unrelated to treatment, and resolved without 
intervention. 
2.6.8.6.  Laboratory findings 
No particular trends in clinical laboratory test results were observed. Cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and 
CSF protein were all within normal range at 12 months.

The results of physical examinations were relatively stable from baseline to Month 12. 
Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiogram results were normal at baseline through Month 12. 
Neurological Exam 
The results of MRI examinations appeared to remain stable from baseline to 12 months: 
Four (4) patients with normal MRI results at baseline remained normal at 12 months, and 13 patients 
with abnormal results (structure changes and white matter changes) at baseline remained abnormal at 
12 months.

Adverse Events by Sex 
Adverse events in the most frequently reported System Organ Classes (SOCs) of Gastrointestinal 
Disorders, Infections and Infestations, Nervous System Disorders, and General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions occurred with a relatively similar incidence between males and females. 
Events within SOCs where there was at least a two-fold percentage difference in SOC occurrence 
between males and females and where there was more than 1 patient in the SOC are summarized in 
the Figure below. Despite the disparity in occurrence, these events are unlikely to indicate a true 
difference in safety of gene therapy based on gender.

Extrinsic Factors 
All studies were performed at one site in Taiwan. Therefore, assessment of extrinsic factors such as 
geographical location was not performed. Other extrinsic factors likely to influence safety of the drug 
were not identified. 
Safety in Other Clinical Settings 
Vectors similar to eladocagene exuparvovec were originally developed for gene therapy in Parkinson’s 
disease, and have also been used to treat AADC deficiency. Although these vectors are not 
eladocagene exuparvovec, they were similar in many ways. Intraputaminal infusion of these vectors 
has proven to be safe in several published studies, as summarized below. 
Figure 41 Comparison of AAV-hAADC Vectors 
In the first-in-human clinical trial, patients with Parkinson’s disease received AAV-hAADC 9x1010 vg 
(n=5) and 3x1011 vg (n=5) via intraputaminal infusion of 100 uL per putamen (Christine 2009). 
Intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 3 patients along the trajectory of the catheter but not at the 
infusion site. The most common AEs were headaches and discomfort at the surgical site, all of which 
resolved. No AEs were attributed to the vector. In an effort to increase the percentage of transduced 
cells and cover more of the putamen, the concentration of vector was increased to 8.3x1011 vg/mL and 
infusion volume was increased to a maximum of either 450 uL/putamen or 900 uL/putamen for a 
maximum total dose of 1.5x1012 vg (Christine 2019). A third dose group in the Christine 2019 study 
received the highest dose of 2.6x1011 vg/mL in a volume up to 900 uL/putamen for a maximum total 
dose of 4.7x1012 vg. The surgical procedure and infusion of larger volumes was well tolerated; 14/15 
patients returned home within 2 days after the surgery. The most frequently reported AE was 
headache, all of which resolved. Dyskinesia (n=4) was considered related to gene therapy and resolved 
with reductions in Parkinson’s disease medications or addition of amantadine. Only 1 patient reported 
SAEs; these were deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and atrial fibrillation which were 
attributed to immobility during the operation and resolved with routine clinical care.

In a second first-in-human clinical trial, 6 patients with Parkinson’s disease were treated with 3x1011 
vg via intraputaminal infusion (Muramatsu 2010). The surgical procedure was well tolerated. One 
patient had a venous haemorrhage, which was determined to be due to the infusion rather than to 
gene transduction; positron emission tomography imaging of this patient showed good AADC 
expression for up to 96 weeks. All patients had headaches around the burr hole for 2 days after 
surgery. No clinical laboratory abnormalities were reported. All patients completed all protocol specified 
visits. Additionally, patients with AADC deficiency were also treated (Kojima 2019). Six patients, ages 
4 to 19 years, received AAV-hAADC-2 in a vector solution containing 0.0001% poloxamer-188 via 
intraputaminal infusion of 100 μL per putamen for a total dose of 2x1011 vg. The surgical procedure 
and infusion were well tolerated. One patient experienced a subdural hemorrhage. All patients 
exhibited choreic movements, which diminished 3 to 6 months after gene therapy. No vector-related 
AEs were observed. All 5 patients who entered the study with a severe phenotype were able to move 
their heads 2 to 8 months after gene therapy. The one patient who entered the study with a moderate 
phenotype was able to walk independently after 6 months, ride a bicycle after 10 months, and play on 
a swing after 18 months. Thus, treatment with AAV-hAADC-2 vector in 0.0001% poloxamer 188 was 
both safe and effective. 
2.6.8.8.  Immunological events 
Anti-AAV2 Antibodies 
Eighteen patients (69.2%) had at least 1 positive antibody titre within the first 12 months; 8 patients 
(30.8%) did not. Adverse events for patients with positive antibody titres generally occurred with a 
similar frequency as AEs for patients who did not have a positive antibody titre. 
See PK/PD discussion on immunogenicity & efficacy discussion on clarification of level of antibodies 
that preclude treatment in the SmPC. The applicant states that the incidence of adverse events was 
similar in those that produced antibodies in response to treatment and those who did not. Subjects 
were excluded if their baseline titre was greater than a threshold level.  
2.6.8.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no information presented on transgene in the systemic circulation. There is an immune 
response to the vector so the vector must enter the systemic circulation.  The active is administered as 
a single dose and given the method and site of administration, there is unlikely to be a drug/drug 
interaction unless the concomitant drug is also administered intraputamen. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Eladocagene exuparvovec is not marketed in any country. No post-marketing information is available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
There are several limitations to the initial safety data presented in support of the marketing 
authorisation. The safety database consists of 26 subjects between the ages of 18 months and 8 years 
and 6 months. An updated analysis provided safety data for 28 subjects. There is no safety data from 
adult or from adolescent subjects. There is no preclinical reproductive toxicology data presented. There 
is no safety data presented in the clinical trial programme for subjects treated with the commercially 
Assessment report

manufactured product. The commercial product contains a novel excipient for which there is no 
preclinical toxicology data presented nor any clinical safety data presented on 
intraputaminal/intraputaminal use in the intended population. 
During the course of the evaluation, the applicant has provided preclinical data in NHP relating to the 
excipient P188 and provides a risk assessment regarding its use in the central nervous system and in 
the paediatric population.  
Twenty-six 26 (100%) of subjects reported an adverse event. Twenty-five 25(96%) reported a pyrexia 
after treatment, 15(57.7%) reported an upper GI haemorrhage & 18 subjects (69.2%) were diagnosed 
with an upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events attributed to the active were dyskinesia, 
which was the most commonly occurring adverse event considered related to treatment and occurred 
in 23(88.5%) of subjects. All events of dyskinesia resolved within 7 months of clinical onset, and most 
resolved within 4 months of gene therapy. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity; 
only2 events were severe.  
Other treatment related adverse events included initial insomnia, which was reported in 4 subjects 
(19%), 2 (7.7%) salivary hypersecretion, 2(7.7%) a feeding disorder and 1 (3.8%) sleep disorder.  
Adverse events related to the neurosurgery included cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 3 subjects (11.5%), 
hypotension 6(23.1%), and endotracheal intubation complication, post-operative skull defect, skin 
injury, subcutaneous haematoma 1 (3.8%) each. 
Eighteen patients, (69.2%) of subjects, had at least 1 positive antibody titre within the first 12 
months. There is no data presented relating to an immune response to the transgene itself nor to a cell 
mediated immune response. 
A high percentage of subjects had a pneumonia or upper respiratory tract infection. The cause of these 
infections was not attributed to the treatment and presumably was considered to be due to the 
underlying disease.  It is hoped that with improved feeding and head control the risk of respiratory 
infections would be decreased after treatment. Although the rate of infections decreased after 
treatment, without a baseline rate of URTI in the treated population it is not possible to interpret the 
clinical relevance of this finding. 
The SmPC has been updated to adequately reflect the adverse event profile. Section 4.8 was updated 
in line with the treatment related adverse events in addition to the adverse events attributable to the 
method of administration of the product i.e. the surgical procedure. Nearly all children experienced an 
adverse event, many of which were serious adverse events. Many of the adverse events and reactions 
which occurred after treatment were attributed to the patient’s underlying disease i.e. AADC. The 
SmPC was updated to state that children may experience exacerbations of symptoms of their 
underlying AADC deficiency. This could be due to the stress of treatment or the surgical procedure. 
There is safety data available on some subjects for up to 5 years after treatment, which demonstrates 
that the risk of treatment related adverse events decreases with time. There is no longer term data 
presented. More data is needed on long-term safety and efficacy follow-up.

patients treated globally with the commercial product, based on data from a registry, according to an 
agreed protocol. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There is a limited safety database. Other treatment related adverse events are possible that have not 
been reported in the data set. There is limited preliminary safety data available from patients treated 
with the commercial manufactured product. There is limited safety data available on the 
intraparenchymal use of the novel excipient. The method of application involves a surgical procedure 
including anaesthesia of high risk and the risks may vary between centres and with the individual 
patient’s underlying condition. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a MA under exceptional circumstances:

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion.  
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request for a translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted  by  the  applicant  proposing  that  the  details  listed  in  Article  54  appear  in  only  one  official 
language  (English)  on  all  packaging  components  (vial  and  outer  carton).  The  main  ground  of  the 
justification  was  the  low  estimated  number  of  patients  treated  per  country  due  to  the  low 
incidence/prevalence  of  the  condition  in  the  EU,  and  the  fact  that  the  medicinal  product  will  not  be 
delivered directly to the patient for self-administration 
The QRD Group partially accepted the translation exemption for the use of English only labels on  the 
immediate  packaging  (vial),  but  the  Group  requested  that  the  outer  carton  have  dual  language 
English(EN)/Germany(DE) labelling as it was noted that a high proportion of the estimated patients to 
be treated, would be German speaking, therefore dual DE/EN would be preferable to EN only.  
In addition, the applicant requested an exemption for omission of particulars on immediate packaging 
(vial label) under Art. 63(3) proposing that the expiry date only be included on the outer carton label, 
and not on the vial label. The main grounds of the justification were: individual packaging of the vial in 
carton  providing  sufficient  information  of  the  expiry  period  to  the  health  care  professionals,  the 
distribution and shipment handled at patient-level, as well as limited amount of long-term stability data 
available at the time of the MAA submission. 
The QRD Group conditionally approved the labelling exemption for the expiry date to only be included 
on the outer carton, and not on the vials, as long as the applicant accepts to include on the outer carton 
the warning ‘Keep the vial in the carton until use’. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Upstaza (eladocagene exuparvovec) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it includes new active substance and is approved under 
exceptional circumstances.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022

Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
AADC deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways 
(Wassenberg 2017). AADC deficiency is due to the presence of pathological variants in the DDC gene 
that encodes for AADC, the enzyme responsible for the decarboxylation of L-DOPA and 5-HTP resulting 
in the production of dopamine and serotonin, respectively (Hyland 1990, Hyland 1992). AADC 
deficiency causes a marked or complete loss of dopamine production in the brain from birth. 
Consequently, patients with AADC deficiency have arrested motor development despite essentially 
preserved neurophysiology and neuroanatomy as determined by brain imaging. Most patients with 
AADC deficiency do not develop functional motor movement, fail to achieve motor milestones (e.g., full 
head control and the ability to sit, stand, and walk), and are at risk of an early death in the first 
decade of life (Hwu 2012). Consequently, patients with AADC deficiency require life- long care. The 
global incidence of AADC deficiency is not well described in the literature. The predicted birth rate of 
individuals with AADC deficiency is estimated to be between 1/42,000 to 1/90,000 in the US (Hyland 
2018, Whitehead 2018, Himmelreich 2019), approximately 1/118,000 in the EU, and 1/182,000 in 
Japan (Himmelreich 2019). These birth rates translate into a current estimate of about 840 living 
patients with AADC deficiency in the US, 853 in the EU, and 125 in Japan (Himmelreich 2019). 
The aim of treatment with Upstaza is to replace the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase in 
the putamen and allow production of dopamine and consequently motor development. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No therapies are presently approved for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Existing therapies are 
primarily intended to treat symptoms and do not treat the underlying cause of the disease. Response 
to Dopaminergic agents has been described in some subjects (Wassenberg 2017). The majority of 
patients, particularly those with no motor development, do not respond to available treatments 
because these therapies cannot replace or increase dopamine production in the brain to adequately 
improve motor function and allow achievement of developmental milestones (Brun 2010, Wassenberg 
2017). The lack of effective treatment clearly indicates that therapies to treat AADC deficiency are 
urgently needed to provide sustained and clinically meaningful improvement of motor development 
and function. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There were three trials submitted in support of the marketing authorisation application. All trials were 
unblinded single arm, single centre investigator led-studies. All studies took place in Taiwan. Historic 
control data from published studies was used as a comparator. The population studied were children 
between the ages of 18 months and 8 years and 6 months. All subjects had the severe phenotype of 
AADC deficiency and all subjects had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of AADC deficiency with at least 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 121/132 
 
 
 
2 mutations in the AADC gene. The majority of subjects in all trials were homozygous for the founder 
mutation of the AADC gene. 
Eladocagene exuparvovec was administered to 28 children with AADC deficiency, using an established 
stereotactic neurosurgical procedure: 
•  AADC-CU/1601 is completed. Eight patients were treated and followed for 5 years. All subjects 
in this trial were treated using process A material. 
•  AADC-010 is ongoing. Ten patients were treated and are being followed for 5 years. All 
patients were treated with process B material. 
•  AADC-011 is ongoing. Eight patients have been treated to date. All patients were treated with 
process B material 
•  An additional 2 patients received treatment by the end of 2019. These patients were included 
in the FAS for subjects treated with process B material. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the population studied, the favourable affects were achievement of motor milestones & 
improvement in motor function. At the time point of initial submission the primary efficacy analysis for 
all patients treated in the ITT population 9/18 patients achieved full head control and 7 of these were 
also able to sit unassisted. In contrast, no natural history control patients achieved these milestones. 
Two 2 (11.1%) were able to stand with support by 24 months.  
At the data lock time point, which occurred after 24 months, 12/18 patients had full head control, 9 
were able to sit unassisted, 3 could stand with support & 1 could walk with assistance. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints showed a similar trend. All studies showed similar trends in 
improvement in motor milestones, PDMS-2 & AIMS scales. 
All subjects showed an increase in PDMS-2 score over time and this increase was greater for subjects 
treated at a younger age.  The mean change in baseline PDMS-2 score at 24 months was 94.3 (95% CI 
75.6-112.9). The scores continued to increase to 60 months. The change in score reflected increases in 
scores for grasping, locomotion, object manipulation and visual-motor integration. The AIMS score 
showed a similar trend with all subjects achieving an increase in score after treatment & a mean 
increase at 24 months of 21.9 (95% CI 16.1-27.6). 
There was an improvement in dystonia and stimulus provoked dystonia in all subjects. 
Following gene therapy, all but 1 subject (95.8%) maintained or gained weight relative to age- and 
gender-matched control children at 12 months after receiving gene therapy. 
In the updated analysis of efficacy (including all subjects treated from process A and process B 
material), using an updated historic comparator natural history database set up by the applicant to 
contextualise the results, the following results were reported. 
At 24 months post treatment, of 22 subjects (14) 64% have achieved full head control (emerging or 
mastery of milestone), (11) 50%sitting without the need for additional support (emerging or mastery 
of milestone), (3) 14% had achieved crawling (emerging or mastery of milestone) with (4) 18% 
achieving standing with support (emerging or mastery of milestone) and no subject had mastered 
walking by 24 months. These percentages increase when emerging skills or subjects who have not fully 
but partially mastered the skill are counted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 122/132 
 
 
 
At 60 months post treatment, there is data available for only 12 subjects: (9) 75% of subjects had full 
head control 5 years after treatment, with (8) 67% retaining the ability to sit unassisted, (3) 25% 
standing with support and (2) 18% walking with assistance. Again, the number of responders 
increases when children who partially mastered a skill are counted. The number of responders also 
increases when other milestones not included in the primary endpoint are assessed, including ability to 
crawl and take steps. 
In a further update, 28 subjects treated in the CT programme, at 2 years, the time point of the 
primary efficacy analysis 64% (18) subjects demonstrated emerging or complete head control.  Fifty 
per cent, 50% (14) were able to sit unassisted and 18% (5) had an emerging or complete mastery of 
standing with support.  
Motor development continued after the 2 year time-point and at the last integrated efficacy 
assessment, by 60 months, 79% (22) subjects had acquired head control, 68% (19) were able to sit 
unassisted, 29% (8) could stand with support and 11% (3) could walk without assistance. Given the 
baseline motor function and age of these subjects, by 60 months the majority of children had achieved 
a significant milestone i.e. were able to sit unassisted.   
The applicant also presented additional benefit observed in subjects treated. There was an observed 
decrease in the annualized rate of upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. However, the data 
is difficult to interpret without knowing the baseline rate of infection in this population. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties include the size of the dataset in the clinical trial programme. 
There was no efficacy or safety data to directly support an indication in adolescents or in children less 
than 18 months of age. All studies were unblinded single arm studies. The comparator dataset was 
taken initially from a publication where all of the characteristics of the control population are not 
known. Acknowledging the limitations of the use of these publications and the lack of data provided 
about the subjects with AADC the applicant established a natural history database for AADC. 
The applicant presented a comparison between 49 subjects with a similar phenotype from the NHDB 
and the study population. There may be inaccuracies and missing data inherent in the publications but 
this is a review of the best available data. 
There is limited safety or efficacy data from patients treated with the commercial product. The 
comparability exercise conducted between product manufactured using process A and process B, was 
not conclusive. Therefore, the clinical data from patients treated with process B product is considered 
pivotal with data from the process A material as supportive.  
There is a high number of empty capsids present in the commercial product - given the limited clinical 
data it is difficult to conclude or exclude that the presence of the high number of empty capsids in the 
product could have an effect on safety or efficacy. During the course of the evaluation, the applicant 
presents preliminary data on 2 subjects in Europe that have received the commercial product. From a 
safety perspective, the safety profile reported is similar to that presented in the clinical trials. There 
was evidence of improvement in neurological symptoms of dystonia and improved head control in 
subjects treated in Europe with the commercial product. However, uncertainties remain about the 
efficacy and safety of the commercial product or whether the quality differences observed in the 
commercial product could impact clinical outcomes.  
At the 2-year post-treatment time point, the benefit observed in the majority of subjects was an 
improvement in head control. Approximately, 50% of subjects did achieve independent sitting at 2

years/24 months post-treatment. It is not possible to identify subjects who may respond better to 
treatment. Motor development continues after 2 years.  
There was no beneficial effect observed with treatment on the autonomic or serotonergic symptoms of 
AADC. 
The clinical relevance of the observed effects and how they relate to improved quality of life for 
patients is not entirely clear. The applicant cited recent literature and results of a survey of AADC 
caregivers that indicates that improved motor control would reduce the burden from their perspective. 
A summary of a limited retrospective survey carried out by the principle investigator of the clinical 
trials conducted also supports this view. These observed benefits must be viewed in the context of the 
limitations to the data, risks and potential risks of the active & the neurosurgery involved in the 
administration. 
There is uncertainty regarding whether a different route of administration (i.e. into midbrain) would 
result in improved efficacy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Twenty-six 26 (100%) of subjects reported an adverse event. 
Twenty-five 25(96%) reported a pyrexia after treatment. 15(57.7%) reported an upper GI 
haemorrhage & 18 subjects (69.2%) were diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection. 
Adverse events attributed to the active were dyskinesia, which was the most commonly occurring 
adverse event considered related to treatment and occurred in 23(88.5%) of subjects. 
Initial insomnia was reported in 4 subjects (19%), 2 (7.7%) salivary hypersecretion, 2(7.7%) a 
feeding disorder and 1 (3.8%) sleep disorder. 
Adverse events related to the neurosurgery included cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 3 subjects (11.5%), 
hypotension 6(23.1%), endotracheal intubation complication, post-operative skull defect, skin injury, 
subcutaneous haematoma 1 (3.8%) each. 
Eighteen patients (69.2%) of subjects had at least 1 positive antibody titre within the first 12 months. 
There were adverse events and reactions related to the anaesthesia and surgical procedure identified 
in the response to the day 120 LOQ. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with these ADRs/AEs. 
Many patients experienced serious symptoms of their underlying disease after treatment. The SmPC 
has been updated to reflect this.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The dataset is small and may not reflect all possible adverse reactions and events. There is limited 
data on long-term safety post treatment. There is very limited safety data available from patients 
treated with the commercial manufactured product. There is limited safety data available on the 
intraparenchymal use of the novel excipient in humans. There is no data available about immune 
response to the transgene itself nor the cell-mediated immune response to the virus. The method of 
application involves a surgical procedure of high risk and the risks may vary between centres, 
surgeons and patients. Many subjects experienced serious adverse events considered related to the 
underlying disease. These events may have been exacerbated by the anaesthetic and procedure 
required for administration of the active.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effects were the achievement of motor milestones. 
The most common motor milestone achieved was head control. Head control is considered an 
important developmental milestone in children. Achievement of head control improves postural control, 
visual orientation & may be the first step prior to the development of other milestones. Better head 
control may allow for improved ability to eat & reduce the risks of aspiration and respiratory infections 
by increasing the ability to clear secretions. Achievement of head control is of benefit to children with 
severe AADC but the benefit must be weighed against the risks of surgery.   
The second most common milestone achieved was ability to sit unassisted. Sitting unassisted improves 
independence, quality of life, improves respiration, and reduces secretion accumulation and risk of 
respiratory infections. Ability to sit unassisted may also reduce the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux. 
The number of children who achieved milestones increased with time and when patients from all 3 
trials had reached the time point of the primary efficacy endpoint were included.  The applicant 
provides some publications, which support an improved quality of life for children treated. Caregivers 
were surveyed and expressed their view that achieving motor milestone would reduce the care burden 
for them and improve quality of life for both caregivers and children with the disease. 
All subjects had an improvement in dystonia and stimulus provoked dystonia but few subjects had an 
improvement in OGC episodes. These neurological symptoms have a significant impact on the patient’s 
quality of life. Further analysis of the time and frequency of OGC episodes in the updated analysis 
showed a modest reduction in time with an OGC episode and a modest reduction in frequency of OGC 
episodes in children treated. It is not clear how significant these improvements are to the patient’s 
quality of life. 
The safety & efficacy of the commercial product is not known as there is limited clinical data available 
from subjects treated with the commercial product. The quality comparability exercise conducted to 
determine whether there were any differences in quality of the products manufactured by process A, B 
and the commercial process C was limited by the amount of material available from product 
manufactured using process A and B. The main difference in quality characteristics of the commercial 
product appears to be an increase in the number of empty capsids. The applicant has presented 
comparable immunogenicity, safety and efficacy data from subjects treated with material from process 
A and Process B, where there is a greater difference in empty capsid number, to support an expected 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 127/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable efficacy and safety profile for the commercial product. However, as the comparability 
exercise conducted between product manufactured using process A and process B, was not conclusive, 
clinical data from patients treated with process B product is considered pivotal with data from the 
process A material as supportive.  
The most frequent adverse reactions reported related to the active was dyskinesia, which although 
troublesome is an indication that the active is working and that dopamine is being produced in the 
brain. However, dyskinesia can be prolonged in some subjects. 
The long terms risks of intraputaminal administration of AAV are unknown. 
The risks of surgery & anaesthesia, which occurred, were those that can be expected with this type of 
surgery. Adverse events and reactions associated with surgery and anaesthesia can be serious and are 
of concern particularly in patients with AADC. Surgery may also increase the risk of occurrence of 
adverse events associated with the disease itself. Other potential risks of surgery include intracranial 
haemorrhage, infection, and death. The risk of surgical complications can vary with operator 
experience and the active should only be administered in centres experienced with stereotactic 
neurosurgery and by appropriately trained staff.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the severe nature of the disease and the absence of effective treatments, there are clinically 
significant benefits observed for some subjects treated with Upstaza.  
However, the efficacy and safety data set available and population treated in the clinical trial 
programme is limited to 28 children between the ages of 18 months to 8 years.  Uncertainties remain 
relating to the small size of the population and efficacy and safety data, the restricted impact of 
treatment on other symptoms of the disease, the paucity of data relating to the impact of treatment on 
quality of life, the limited data relating to the efficacy and safety of the commercial product, the lack of 
demonstration of comparability between process A and process B product and the clinical relevance, if 
any, of the high percentage of empty capsids in the commercial product.  
The applicant argued that the indication could be extended to subjects with some motor milestones 
and to those with a more severe phenotype requiring ventilation, with contractures and with no motor 
movement. There was no new clinical data using the product presented to support the extension of 
indication.  The applicant supported the extension of indication with publications using a different 
vector/active. 
Considering the uncertainties and as this is the first adeno-associated viral vector gene therapy 
product that could be authorised for intraputaminal administration, an expert group has been convened 
to provide advice. Despite the small population studied in the clinical trials and the uncertainties as 
previously outlined in the assessment report, the experts were positive about the clinical relevance of 
the motor benefits received in patients. They considered that children with severe disease with head 
control could benefit from treatment. They considered that children with severe disease, no motor 
movements and requiring ventilation may benefit from treatment. They did not identify any specific 
patient characteristics to identify children that may benefit more from treatment. They considered that 
the safety profile was generally acceptable. However, it is possible that the number of adverse events 
related to the surgical procedure could increase once more centres are allowed to administer Upstaza. 
The experts have recommended that comprehensive training and supervision program should be 
developed. A close follow-up to characterise long term safety and efficacy (preferably integrated in the 
INTD registry) is also expected.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/571076/2022  
Page 128/132 
 
 
 
Benefits observed in children treated with Upstaza are considered clinically relevant by clinical experts 
involved in treating patients with AADC. The indication has been updated to reflect the expert opinion. 
Considering the unmet need, the motor benefits observed in children up to the age of 19 (treated with 
a similar gene therapy using a similar dose injected intra-putaminally), the CAT considered that the 
indication for treatment could be extended to adults.  
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety (as missing information) of the commercial product a post-
authorisation  study  is  requested,  which  should  include  the  relevant  efficacy  endpoints  such  as  motor 
behavioural development, as well as safety endpoints.  
The ongoing long-term follow-up PASS study of subject treated in the clinical trial programme should be 
completed and results submitted. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was proposed by the CAT during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The CAT considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances as 
described above.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Upstaza is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit- risk balance of Upstaza is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Upstaza is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 18 months and older with a clinical, molecular, 
and genetically confirmed diagnosis of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency with a 
severe phenotype (see section 5.1). 
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Assessment report

Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Upstaza in the treatment of 
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is favourable and therefore recommends the 
granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances subject to the following 
conditions: 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Upstaza in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the content and 
format of the educational material (ie, Surgical Guide and Pharmacy manual), including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The MAH should ensure that Upstaza is distributed to selected treatment centres performing the 
administration of the product where qualified staff will have been delivered with educational materials, 
including the Upstaza Surgical Guide and the Pharmacy manual. 
The treatment centres will be selected based on the following criteria:  
•  Presence of or affiliation with a neurosurgeon experienced in stereotactic neurosurgeries and 
capable of administrating Upstaza;  
•  Presence of a clinical pharmacy capable of handling and preparing adeno-associated virus 
vector-based gene therapy products; 
•  Ultra-low temperature freezers (≤ -65 ºC) available within the treatment centre pharmacy for 
treatment storage.  
Assessment report

4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Levetiracetam is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed 
epilepsy.

Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy 
 
 
 
in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy. 
in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 
12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Partial onset seizures 
The recommended dosing for monotherapy (from 16 years of age) and adjunctive therapy is the same; 
as outlined below. 
All indications 
Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more 
The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of 
treatment. However, a lower initial dose of 250 mg twice daily may be given based on physician 
assessment of seizure reduction versus potential side effects. This can be increased to 500 mg twice 
daily after two weeks. 
Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1500 mg 
twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily increases or decreases every 
two to four weeks. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing below 50 kg and children from 1 month of age 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to weight, age and dose. Refer to Paediatric population section for dosing adjustments based 
on weight. 
Discontinuation 
If levetiracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually (e.g. in adults and 
adolescents weighing more than 50 kg: 500 mg decreases twice daily every two to four weeks; in 
infants older than 6 months, children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg: dose decrease should 
not exceed 10 mg/kg twice daily every two weeks; in infants (less than 6 months): dose decrease 
should not exceed 7 mg/kg twice daily every two weeks). 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years and older) 
Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function (see 
“Renal impairment” below). 
Renal impairment 
The daily dose must be individualised according to renal function. 
For adult patients, refer to the following table and adjust the dose as indicated. To use this dosing 
table, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in ml/min is needed. The CLcr in ml/min 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for adults and adolescents weighing 
50 kg or more, the following formula: 
                               [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) 
CLcr (ml/min) = ----------------------------------------- (x 0.85 for women) 
                                72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows: 
                                              CLcr (ml/min) 
CLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = ---------------------------- x 1.73

(1) A 750 mg loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with levetiracetam. 
(2) Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended. 
For children with renal impairment, levetiracetam dose needs to be adjusted based on the renal 
function as levetiracetam clearance is related to renal function. This recommendation is based on a 
study in adult renally impaired patients. 
The CLcr in ml/min/1.73 m2 may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for young 
adolescents, children and infants, using the following formula (Schwartz formula):

End-stage renal 
disease patients 
undergoing 
dialysis 
(1) Levetiracetam oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not multiple of 
250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients 
unable to swallow tablets. 
(2) A 10.5 mg/kg (0.105 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with 
levetiracetam. 
(3) A 15 mg/kg (0.15 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with 
levetiracetam. 
(4) Following dialysis, a 3.5 to 7 mg/kg (0.035 to 0.07 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. 
(5) Following dialysis, a 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate the renal insufficiency. 
Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine 
clearance is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Paediatric population 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength 
according to age, weight and dose. 
The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. 
Levetiracetam oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the 
available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less 
than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In 
all of the above cases levetiracetam oral solution should be used. 
Monotherapy 
The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy 
treatment have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Adolescents (16 and 17 years of age) weighing 50 kg or more with partial onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation with newly diagnosed epilepsy.  
Please refer to the above section on Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 
kg or more. 
Add-on therapy for infants aged from 6 to 23 months, children (2 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 
17 years) weighing less than 50 kg 
Levetiracetam oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 
6 years. 
For children 6 years and above, Levetiracetam oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, 
for doses not multiple of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple 
tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lowest effective dose should be used for all indications. The starting dose for a child or adolescent 
of 25kg should be 250mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750mg twice daily. 
Dose in children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults for all indications. 
Please refer to the above section on Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 
kg or more for all indications. 
Add-on therapy for infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months 
The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants. 
Method of administration 
The film-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufficient quantity of liquid and may be 
taken with or without food. After oral administration the bitter taste of levetiracetam may be 
experienced. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal impairment 
The administration of levetiracetam to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In 
patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before 
dose selection (see section 4.2). 
Acute Kidney injury 
The use of levetiracetam has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury, with a time to onset 
ranging from a few days to several months. 
Blood cell counts 
Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with levetiracetam 
administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in 
patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders 
(section 4.8). 
Suicide 
Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with 
anti-epileptic agents (including levetiracetam). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled 
trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. 
Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and 
behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) 
should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or 
behaviour emerge. 
Abnormal and aggressive behaviours  
Levetiracetam may cause psychotic symptoms and behavioural abnormalities including irritability and 
aggressiveness. Patients treated with levetiracetam should be monitored for developing psychiatric 
signs suggesting important mood and/or personality changes. If such behaviours are noticed, treatment 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adaptation or gradual discontinuation should be considered. If discontinuation is considered, please 
refer to section 4.2. 
Worsening of seizures 
As with other types of antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam may rarely exacerbate seizure frequency or 
severity. This paradoxical effect was mostly reported within the first month after levetiracetam 
initiation or increase of the dose, and was reversible upon drug discontinuation or dose decrease. 
Patients should be advised to consult their physician immediately in case of aggravation of epilepsy. 
Lack of efficacy or seizure worsening has for example been reported in patients with epilepsy 
associated with sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 (SCN8A) mutations. 
Electrocardiogram QT interval prolongation 
Rare cases of ECG QT interval prolongation have been observed during the post-marketing 
surveillance. Levetiracetam should be used with caution in patients with QTc-interval prolongation, in 
patients concomitantly treated with drugs affecting the QTc-interval, or in patients with relevant pre-
existing cardiac disease or electrolyte disturbances. 
Paediatric population 
The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. 
Available data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects 
on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children 
remain unknown. 
Excipients 
Levetiracetam Accord 750 mg film-coated tablets contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause 
allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Antiepileptic medicinal products 
Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that levetiracetam did not 
influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these 
antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. 
As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric 
patients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam. 
A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy 
(4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not 
influence the steady-state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered carbamazepine and 
valproate. However, data suggested a 20 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking 
enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required. 
Probenecid 
Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to 
inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite, but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the 
concentration of this metabolite remains low.  
Methotrexate  
Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and methotrexate has been reported to decrease 
methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in 
patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs. 
Oral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics interactions 
Levetiracetam 1000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives 
(ethinyl-estradiol and levonorgestrel); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and progesterone) 
were not modified. Levetiracetam 2000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of digoxin 
and warfarin; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with digoxin, oral 
contraceptives and warfarin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. 
Laxatives 
There have been isolated reports of decreased levetiracetam efficacy when the osmotic laxative 
macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral levetiracetam. Therefore, macrogol should 
not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking levetiracetam. 
Food and alcohol 
The extent of absorption of levetiracetam was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was 
slightly reduced. 
No data on the interaction of levetiracetam with alcohol are available. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child bearing potential  
Specialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Treatment with 
levetiracetam should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become pregnant. As with all 
antiepileptic medicines, sudden discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this may lead to 
breakthrough seizures that could have serious consequences for the woman and the unborn child. 
Monotherapy should be preferred whenever possible because therapy with multiple antiepileptic 
medicines AEDs could be associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than 
monotherapy, depending on the associated antiepileptics. 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of postmarketing data on pregnant women exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy 
(more than 1800, among which in more than 1500 exposure occurred during the 1st trimester) do not 
suggest an increase in the risk for major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is available 
on the neurodevelopment of children exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy in utero. However, 
current epidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not suggest an increased risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders or delays. 
Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after careful assessment it is considered clinically 
needed. In such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended.  
Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in 
levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more 
pronounced during the third trimester (up to 60% of baseline concentration before pregnancy). 
Appropriate clinical management of pregnant women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured.  
Breastfeeding 
Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended. 
However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment 
should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, 
potential risk for human is unknown. 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Levetiracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to 
possible different individual sensitivity, some patients might experience somnolence or other central 
nervous system related symptoms, especially at the beginning of treatment or following a dose 
increase. Therefore, caution is recommended in those patients when performing skilled tasks, e.g. 
driving vehicles or operating machinery. Patients are advised not to drive or use machines until it is 
established that their ability to perform such activities is not affected. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue 
and dizziness. The adverse reaction profile presented below is based on the analysis of pooled 
placebo-controlled clinical trials with all indications studied, with a total of 3,416 patients treated with 
levetiracetam. These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label 
extension studies, as well as post-marketing experience. The safety profile of levetiracetam is 
generally similar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy 
indications.   
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies (adults, adolescents, children and infants> 1 month) and 
from post-marketing experience are listed in the following table per System Organ Class and per 
frequency. Adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness and their frequency 
is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10000).

** Very rare cases of development of obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) in patients with 
underlying history of OCD or psychiatric disorders have been observed in post-marketing surveillance. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
The risk of anorexia is higher when levetiracetam is coadministered with topiramate. 
In several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued. Bone 
marrow suppression was identified in some of the cases of pancytopenia. 
Cases of encephalopathy generally occurred at the beginning of the treatment (few days to a 
few months) and were reversible after treatment discontinuation. 
Paediatric population 
In patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, a total of 190 patients have been treated with 
levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. Sixty of these patients were 
treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 
patients have been treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. 
233 of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In both these 
paediatric age ranges, these data are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of 
levetiracetam. 
In addition, 101 infants aged less than 12 months have been exposed in a post authorization safety 
study. No new safety concerns for levetiracetam were identified for infants less than 12 months of age 
with epilepsy.  
The adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the 
approved epilepsy indications. Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical 
studies were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and 
psychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults. In children and 
adolescents aged 4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood 
swings (common, 2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal 
behaviour (common, 5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other 
age ranges or in the overall safety profile. In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, 
irritability (very common, 11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more 
frequently than in other age groups or in the overall safety profile. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed 
the cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with 
partial onset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non inferior) from 
placebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory

Screen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional 
functioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behaviour as 
measured in a standardised and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL – Achenbach 
Child Behavior Checklist). However, subjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label 
follow-up study, did not experience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional 
functioning; in particular measures of aggressive behaviour were not worse than baseline. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma 
were observed with Levetiracetam overdoses. 
Management of overdose 
After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. 
There is no specific antidote for levetiracetam. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may 
include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for levetiracetam and 74 % for the 
primary metabolite. 
5.     PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1    Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX14. 
The active substance, levetiracetam, is a pyrrolidone derivative (S-enantiomer of 
α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide), chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active 
substances. 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal 
neurotransmission. 
In vitro studies show that levetiracetam affects intraneuronal Ca2+ levels by partial inhibition of N-type 
Ca2+ currents and by reducing the release of Ca2+ from intraneuronal stores. In addition it partially 
reverses the reductions in GABA- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and β-carbolines. 
Furthermore, levetiracetam has been shown in in vitro studies to bind to a specific site in rodent brain 
tissue. This binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, believed to be involved in vesicle fusion 
and neurotransmitter exocytosis. Levetiracetam and related analogs show a rank order of affinity for 
binding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A which correlates with the potency of their anti-seizure 
protection in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy. This finding suggests that the interaction 
between levetiracetam and the synaptic vesicle protein 2A seems to contribute to the antiepileptic 
mechanism of action of the medicinal product. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Levetiracetam induces seizure protection in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary 
generalised seizures without having a pro-convulsant effect. The primary metabolite is inactive. 
In man, an activity in both partial and generalised epilepsy conditions (epileptiform 
discharge/photoparoxysmal response) has confirmed the broad spectrum pharmacological profile of 
levetiracetam. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation 
in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy. 
In adults, levetiracetam efficacy has been demonstrated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
at 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day, given in 2 divided doses, with a treatment duration of up to 18 
weeks. In a pooled analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved 50 % or greater reduction from 
baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week at stable dose (12/14 weeks) was of 27.7 %, 
31.6 % and 41.3 % for patients on 1000, 2000 or 3000 mg levetiracetam respectively and of 12.6 % for 
patients on placebo. 
Paediatric population 
In paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study, which included 198 patients and had a treatment duration of 14 weeks. In 
this study, the patients received levetiracetam as a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg/day (with twice a day 
dosing). 
44.6 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 19.6 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater reduction from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week. With continued 
long-term treatment, 11.4 % of the patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.2 % were 
seizure-free for at least 1 year. 
In paediatric patients (1 month to less than 4 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which included 116 patients and had a treatment duration of 5 
days. In this study, patients were prescribed 20mg /kg, 25 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg daily dose of 
oral solution based on their age titration schedule. A dose of 20 mg/kg/day titrating to 40 mg/kg/day 
for infants one month to less than six months and a dose of 25 mg/kg/day titrating to 50 mg/kg/day for 
infants and children 6 months to less than 4 years old, was use in this study. The total daily dose was 
administered twice daily. 
The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50 % 
reduction from baseline in average daily partial onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central 
reader using a 48-hour video EEG. The efficacy analysis consisted of 109 patients who had at least 
24 hours of video EEG in both baseline and evaluation periods. 43.6 % of the levetiracetam treated 
patients and 19.6 % of the patients on placebo were considered as responders. The results are 
consistent across age group. With continued long-term treatment, 8.6 % of the patients were 
seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.8 % were seizure-free for at least 1 year. 
35 infants aged less than 1 year with partial onset seizures have been exposed in placebo-control 
clinical studies of which only 13 were aged < 6 months. 
Monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Efficacy of levetiracetam as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, 
non-inferiority comparison to carbamazepine-controlled release (CR) in 576 patients 16 years of age 
or older with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked 
partial seizures or with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only. The patients were randomized to 
carbamazepine CR 400 – 1200 mg/day or levetiracetam 1000 -3000 mg /day, the duration of the 
treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Six-month seizure freedom was achieved in 73.0 % of levetiracetam-treated patients and 72.8 % of 
carbamazepine-CR treated patients; the adjusted absolute difference between treatments was 0.2% (95 
% CI: -7.8 8.2). More than half of the subjects remained seizure free for 12 months (56.6 % and 58.5 
% of subjects on levetiracetam and on carbamazepine CR respectively). 
In a study reflecting clinical practice, the concomitant antiepileptic medication could be withdrawn in 
a limited number of patients who responded to levetiracetam adjunctive therapy (36 adult patients out 
of 69). 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of 
age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks 
duration, in patients 12 years of age and older suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy with 
myoclonic seizures in different syndromes. The majority of patients presented with juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy.  
In this study, levetiracetam, dose was 3000 mg/day given in 2 divided doses. 58.3 % of the 
levetiracetam treated patients and 23.3 % of the patients on placebo had at least a 50 % reduction in 
myoclonic seizure days per week. With continued long-term treatment, 28.6 % of the patients were 
free of myoclonic seizures for at least 6 months and 21.0 % were free of myoclonic seizures for at 
least 1 year. 
Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam efficacy was established in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study which 
included adults, adolescents and a limited number of children suffering from idiopathic generalized 
epilepsy with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in different syndromes (juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand 
Mal seizures on awakening). In this study, levetiracetam dose was 3000 mg /day for adults and 
adolescents or 60 mg/kg/day for children, given in 2 divided doses. 
72.2 % of the levetiracetam treated patients and 45.2 % of the patients on placebo had a 50 % or 
greater decrease in the frequency of PGTC seizures per week. With continued long-term treatment, 
47.4 % of the patients were free of tonic-clonic seizures for at least 6 months and 31.5 % were free of 
tonic-clonic seizures for at least 1 year. 
5.2    Pharmacokinetic properties 
Levetiracetam is a highly soluble and permeable compound. The pharmacokinetic profile is linear with 
low intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no modification of the clearance after repeated 
administration. There is no evidence for any relevant gender, race or circadian variability. The 
pharmacokinetic profile is comparable in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy. 
Due to its complete and linear absorption, plasma levels can be predicted from the oral dose of 
levetiracetam expressed as mg/kg bodyweight. Therefore, there is no need for plasma level monitoring 
of levetiracetam. 
A significant correlation between saliva and plasma concentrations has been shown in adults and 
children (ratio of saliva/plasma concentrations ranged from 1 to 1.7 for oral tablet formulation and 
after 4 hours post-dose for oral solution formulation). 
Adults and adolescents 
Absorption 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Levetiracetam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Oral absolute bioavailability is close to 
100 %. 
Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are achieved at 1.3 hours after dosing. Steady-state is achieved after 
two days of a twice daily administration schedule. 
Peak concentrations (Cmax) are typically 31 and 43 μg/ml following a single 1000 mg dose and 
repeated 1000 mg twice daily dose, respectively. 
The extent of absorption is dose-independent and is not altered by food. 
Distribution 
No tissue distribution data are available in humans. 
Neither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolite are significantly bound to plasma proteins (< 10 %). 
The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is approximately 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, a value close to the total 
body water volume. 
Biotransformation 
Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. The major metabolic pathway (24 % of the 
dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. Production of the primary metabolite, ucb 
L057, is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoforms. Hydrolysis of the acetamide group was 
measurable in a large number of tissues including blood cells. The metabolite ucb L057 is 
pharmacologically inactive. 
Two minor metabolites were also identified. One was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone 
ring (1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the pyrrolidone ring (0.9 % of the dose). 
Other unidentified components accounted only for 0.6 % of the dose. 
No enantiomeric interconversion was evidenced in vivo for either levetiracetam or its primary 
metabolite. 
In vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human 
liver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl 
transferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities. In addition, levetiracetam 
does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. 
In human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or 
UGT1A1. Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in 
vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme 
induction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of Levetiracetam with other substances, or 
vice versa, is unlikely. 
Elimination 
The plasma half-life in adults was 7±1 hours and did not vary either with dose, route of administration 
or repeated administration. The mean total body clearance was 0.96 ml/min/kg. 
The major route of excretion was via urine, accounting for a mean 95 % of the dose (approximately 
93 % of the dose was excreted within 48 hours). Excretion via faeces accounted for only 0.3 % of the 
dose. 
The cumulative urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary metabolite accounted for 66 % and 
24 % of the dose, respectively during the first 48 hours. 
The renal clearance of levetiracetam and ucb L057 is 0.6 and 4.2 ml/min/kg respectively indicating 
that levetiracetam is excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular reabsorption and that 
the primary metabolite is also excreted by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. 
Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. 
Elderly 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the elderly, the half-life is increased by about 40 % (10 to 11 hours). This is related to the decrease 
in renal function in this population (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The apparent body clearance of both levetiracetam and of its primary metabolite is correlated to the 
creatinine clearance. It is therefore recommended to adjust the maintenance daily dose of 
levetiracetam, based on creatinine clearance in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
(see section 4.2). 
In anuric end-stage renal disease adult subjects the half-life was approximately 25 and 3.1 hours 
during interdialytic and intradialytic periods, respectively.  
The fractional removal of levetiracetam was 51 % during a typical 4-hour dialysis session. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, there was no relevant modification of the 
clearance of levetiracetam. In most subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the clearance of 
levetiracetam was reduced by more than 50 % due to a concomitant renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Children (4 to 12 years) 
Following single oral dose administration (20 mg/kg) to epileptic children (6 to 12 years), the half-life 
of levetiracetam was 6.0 hours. The apparent body weight adjusted clearance was approximately 30 % 
higher than in epileptic adults. 
Following repeated oral dose administration (20 to 60 mg/kg/day) to epileptic children (4 to 12 years), 
levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration was observed 0.5 to 1.0 hour after 
dosing. Linear and dose proportional increases were observed for peak plasma concentrations and area 
under the curve. The elimination half-life was approximately 5 hours. The apparent body clearance 
was 1.1 ml/min/kg. 
Infants and children (1 month to 4 years) 
Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 100 mg/ml oral solution to epileptic children 
(1 month to 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were 
observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that half-life was 
shorter (5.3 h) than for adults (7.2 h) and apparent clearance was faster (1.5 ml/min/kg) than for adults 
(0.96 ml/min/kg). 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted in patients from 1 month to 16 years of age, 
body weight was significantly correlated to apparent clearance (clearance increased with an increase in 
body weight) and apparent volume of distribution. Age also had an influence on both parameters. This 
effect was pronounced for the younger infants, and subsided as age increased, to become negligible 
around 4 years of age. 
In both population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was about a 20 % increase of apparent clearance of 
levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal product. 
5.3    Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. 
Adverse effects not observed in clinical studies but seen in the rat and to a lesser extent in the mouse at 
exposure levels similar to human exposure levels and with possible relevance for clinical use were 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver changes, indicating an adaptive response such as increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy, 
fatty infiltration and increased liver enzymes in plasma. 
No adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction performance were observed in rats at 
doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 or exposure basis) in parents and F1 
generation. 
Two embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies were performed in rats at 400, 1200 and 
3600 mg/kg/day. At 3600 mg/kg/day, in only one of the 2 EFD studies, there was a slight decrease in 
foetal weight associated with a marginal increase in skeletal variations/minor anomalies. There was no 
effect on embryomortality and no increased incidence of malformations. The NOAEL (No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level) was 3600 mg/kg/day for pregnant female rats (x 12 the MRHD on a 
mg/m2basis) and 1200 mg /kg/day for fetuses. 
Four embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rabbits covering doses of 200, 600, 800, 
1200 and 1800 mg /kg/day. The dose level of 1800 mg/kg/day induced a marked maternal toxicity and 
a decrease in foetal weight associated with increased incidence of foetuses with cardiovascular/skeletal 
anomalies. The NOAEL was <200 mg/kg/day for the dams and 200 mg/kg/day for the foetuses (equal 
to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 
A peri- and post-natal development study was performed in rats with levetiracetam doses of 70, 350 
and 1800 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was ≥ 1800 mg/kg/day for the F0 females, and for the survival, 
growth and development of the F1 offspring up to weaning (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). 
Neonatal and juvenile animal studies in rats and dogs demonstrated that there were no adverse effects 
seen in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints at doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x 
6 - 17 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).

Possible side effects 
1.   What Levetiracetam Accord is and what it is used for 
Levetiracetam Accord is an antiepileptic medicine (a medicine used to treat seizures in epilepsy). 
Levetiracetam Accord is used: 
  on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only 
one side of the brain but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain 
(partial onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given 
to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits. 
as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: 
 
- 
partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents, children 
and infants from one month of age; 
-  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults 
- 
and adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; 
primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) 
in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy 
(the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). 
2.   What you need to know before you take Levetiracetam Accord 
Do not take Levetiracetam Accord 
- 
If you are allergic to levetiracetam, pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in Section 6).

If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor’s instructions. He/she may decide if  
your dose should be adjusted. 
If you notice any slow down in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child,  
please contact your doctor. 
- 
-  A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Levetiracetam Accord have  
had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or  
suicidal ideation, please contact your doctor. 
If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. 
-

days: 
  Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually, or if you or your 
family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
  Aggravation of epilepsy: 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month after 
the start of the treatment or increase of the dose.  
In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy (epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that 
causes multiple types of seizures and loss of skills you may notice that the seizures remain 
present or are becoming worse during your treatment.  
If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Levetiracetam Accord, see a doctor as soon 
as possible.

levetiracetam as this may results in a loss of its effect. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only

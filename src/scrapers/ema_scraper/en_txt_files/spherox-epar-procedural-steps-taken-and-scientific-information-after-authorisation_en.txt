compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with ACT3D-
CS to microfracture in subjects with cartilage defects of the 
knee with a defect size between 1 and 4 cm2. Patients will

Overall, the Phase 3 trial with microfracture (MF) as 
comparator continued to indicate consistent outcomes for 
Spherox compared to MF. Updated safety results for study 
16 HS 13 (48 month follow-up) were also provided. The 
overall safety profile for Spherox remains unchanged.  
The PI was updated to reflect bone marrow oedema as 
common adverse reaction and to reflect the study results.

Results from both studies confirmed that outcomes were 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect 
the study results of the 36-month follow up data for 
trial cod 16 HS 13 and the final study report with 60-
month follow-up data for trial cod 16 HS 14. 
Study cod 16 HS 13, is a Prospective, randomised, 
open label, multicentre Phase-III clinical trial to 
compare the efficacy and safety of the treatment 
with the autologous chondrocyte transplantation 
product co.don chondrosphere (ACT3D-CS) with 
microfracture in subjects with cartilage defects of the 
knee with a defect size between 1 and 4 cm2. 
consistent with previous submitted data These results were 
reflected in section 5.1. In study cod 16 HS 14, the primary 
efficacy variable, change of overall KOOS from baseline at 
60 months, was on average (SD) 19.9±18.0, very similar 
to the 48-month data (mean: 20.1 ±17.3), showing a 
clinically relevant and sustained improvement in KOOS. In 
line with previous reports, no relevant differences between 
the low, medium, and high dose were noted. KOOS 
subscores were also consistent with previous data. MOCART 
scores at 60 months were also consistent with previous 
data i.e. maintained improvement with no evidence of a 
dose response. The overall MOCART score at 60 months for

Study cod 16 HS 14, is a Prospective, randomised, 
open label, multicentre Phase-II clinical trial to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment 
of large defects (4-10 cm2) with three different 
doses of the autologous chondrocyte transplantation 
product co.don chondrosphere (ACT3D-CS) in 
subjects with cartilage defects of the knee.

all doses combined was 75.1±14.5, similar to previous 
data. 
In study cod 16 HS 13 results for overall KOOS and change 
of overall KOOS from baseline at 36 months were 
presented. For the patients treated with ACT3D-CS the 
mean overall KOOS score was 83.2 ± 14.9 as compared 
with 76.3 ± 17.1 for MF. The mean change from baseline 
was +26.6 ± 16.2 for patients in the ACT3D-CS group and 
24.5 ± 16.7 for those in the MF group. Overall, this is in 
line with the previous data. KOOS subscores also showed a 
pattern that was consistent with previous data. The 
MOCART score at 36 months was respectively 75.0 ± 13.4 
and 78.3 ± 12.6 for the ACT3D-CS and microfracture 
groups showing consistency over time. 
No new safety concerns were identified in the data 
presented for both studies.  Section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
relevant section of the PL was updated to differentiate any 
surgery-related event terms and depicting them separately.

VidPrevtyn Beta: Periodic safety update report 
assessment 
10 November 2022 to 9 May 2023 
This document consists of: 
1. The PRAC assessment report of the  VidPrevtyn Beta periodic safety update report 
(PSUR) covering the period 10 November 2022 to 9 May 2023, and;
2. The VidPrevtyn Beta PSUR itself.
The PSUR is a pharmacovigilance document intended to provide an evaluation of the risk-
benefit balance of the medicinal product during the reference period mentioned above.  
The objective of the PSUR is to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of the risk-benefit 
balance of the product, taking into account new or emerging safety information in the context 
of cumulative information on risk and benefits. The marketing authorisation holder is legally 
required to submit PSURs at defined time points after the authorisation of a medicinal product. 
EMA’s safety committee, the PRAC, assesses information in the PSUR to determine if there are 
new risks identified for a medicine and/or if its risk-benefit balance has changed. The outcome 
of this assessment is summarised in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR. 
The PSUR and the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR include information about suspected 
side effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed following the use of the vaccine, but 
which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine itself. Information on suspected 
side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the vaccine or the active substance 
causes the observed event or is unsafe to use.  
Only a detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data, as 
described in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR, can determine the impact of 
new data on the benefits and risks of a medicine. 
Further information on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and on PSUR submission and 
assessment is available on the EMA website. 
This document may contain redactions for commercially confidential information (CCI) and 
protected personal data (PPD) in accordance with applicable legislation and guidance.

1. 
Background  information  on the  procedure 
This is the assessment of PSUR(s) submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of 
Union reference dates (EURD list) for SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 variant, prefusion Spike delta TM protein, 
recombinant. 
2.  Assessment  conclusions  and  actions 
This is  the  pt  single assessment of the PSUR for SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 variant,  prefusion Spike delta TM 
protein, recombinant containing product (Vidprevtyn Beta) covering the period from 10 November 2022 to 
9 May 2023. 
Vidprevtyn Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in adults who have 
previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
Vidprevtyn  Beta  is  an  adjuvanted vaccine  composed  of  the  soluble trimeric SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S 
protein  (B.1.351  strain)  stabilized  in  its  prefusion  conformation  and  deleted  of  its  transmembrane  and 
intracellular domains. Vidprevtyn Beta is available as solution and emulsion for emulsion for injection. One 
dose (0.5 ml) contains five micrograms of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein (B.1.351 strain) formulated 
with adjuvant system 03 adjuvant and is administered intramuscularly. 
The International Birth Date (IBD) of Vidprevtyn Beta is 10 November 2022 when it was first authorised in 
the EU. During this interval period, a marketing authorization was granted in the UK on 20 December 2022. 
Vidprevtyn Beta is currently marketed in 4 EU member states (AT, FR, IT, PT) and 1 non-EU state (UK) and 
is approved in a total of 32 countries worldwide. 
The MAH provided the exposure data based on administered doses. The total number of doses of Vidprevtyn 
Beta  administered  in  the  EU  is  approximately  6  920  up  to  20  April  2023. The  total  number  of  doses  in 
England could be estimated to be approximately 1 630 039 up to 7 May 2023. 
During  this  reporting  period,  no  new  signals  were  identified.  However,  according  to  the  late-breaking 
information,  one signal on allergic including anaphylactic reactions was opened and the MAH submitted a 
variation related to hypersensitivity reactions  (EMENH/C/005754/11/0006). Information about  this signal 
and the outcome of the procedure will be provided by MAH in the next PSUR. 
No new safety information was identified  by the MAH and no actions were taken for safety reasons during 
this  reporting  interval.  Nevertheless,  a  total  of  40  cases  concerning  dizziness  in  the  first  days  after 
vaccination  were  reported,  16  of  which  were  serious  of  which  9  had  a  close  temporal  relationship  and 
simultaneous occurrence of  other possible symptoms of  reactogenicity.  Within the responses to the  RSI, 
the MAH  provided an updated review of dizziness from the post-marketing period until 30 June  2023:  50 
cases were reported  cumulatively. Considering  the above as  well as the  data  collected  during the  clinical 
trials, the PRAC recommends to update the product information to include dizziness with a frequency rare. 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  assess  all  AESI  listed  in  the  RMP  version  1.0  in  the next  PSUR,  including  O/E 
analysis and to determine the range of AESI risk window based on acceptable sources. 
Moreover,  the MAH  should make all efforts to  obtain the maximum available information on the reported 
cases during the follow-ups and to discuss the updated cases in view of new information including causality 
assessment in next PSURs. 
The benefit-risk balance of Vidprevtyn Beta remains unchanged in its approved indications.

3.  Recommendations 
Based  on the PRAC  Rapporteur review of  data  on  safety and efficacy, the PRAC considers that the risk­
benefit balance of medicinal products containing SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 variant,  prefusion  Spike  delta TM 
protein, recombinant remains unchanged but recommends that  the terms  of the marketing 
authorisation(s) should  be varied  as  follows: 
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
In view of available data  on  dizziness from clinical trials,  spontaneous reports,  including in some cases  a 
close temporal relationship,  the PRAC considers  a causal  relationship  between  SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 
variant,  prefusion  Spike delta TM  protein,  recombinant  and dizziness  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility. 
The  PRAC  concluded  that the product information  of  products containing  SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 variant, 
prefusion  Spike delta TM  protein,  recombinant should be amended  accordingly. 
Precise scope: 
Update  of  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC to add  the  adverse reaction  dizziness with a  frequency  rare. The 
Package  leaflet  is  updated accordingly. 
The following changes to the  product  information  of medicinal  products containing  SARS-CoV-2,  B.1.351 
variant,  prefusion  Spike  delta TM  protein,  recombinant  are  recommended (new text  underlined and in 
bold,  deleted  text strike through):

1.  PSUR  Data 
1.1.  Introduction 
VidPrevtyn  Beta (COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted)) is a recombinant  protein  vaccine  derived 
from the SARS  CoV-2  prefusion Spike (S)  delta TM (CoV-2  pres  dTM  ) (B.1.351  strain).  VidPrevtyn  Beta 
is an adjuvanted vaccine composed  of  the  soluble trimeric SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S  protein (B.1.351 
strain) stabilized  in  its prefusion conformation  and deleted  of  its transmembrane and intracellular 
domains. The  combination  of antigen and adjuvant  enhances  the  magnitude  of immune response,  which 
may contribute  to  protection  against COVID-19. 
VidPrevtyn  Beta  is available as  solution  and emulsion for emulsion  for injection. The volume after mixing 
one vial  of antigen  solution  (2.5  ml)  with one vial  of adjuvant  emulsion  (2.5  ml) allows for delivery  of 10 
doses  of vaccine (0.5 ml per  dose).  One dose (0.5  ml)  of VidPrevtyn  Beta contains five micrograms  of 
recombinant  SARS-CoV-2 S  protein (B.1.351  strain)  formulated with  adjuvant system 03  (AS03)  adjuvant 
for booster vaccination  and  is  administered  intramuscularly. 
VidPrevtyn  Beta  is approved as a  booster dose for active immunization to  prevent COVID-19  caused  by 
SARS-CoV-2  in adults  who have  previously  received a messenger ribonucleic acid  (mRNA)  or adenoviral 
vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
In  individuals  18 years  of age and older,  VidPrevtyn  Beta is  administered  intramuscularly  as a  single  dose 
of 0.5 ml at least four months  after a  previous  COVID-19  vaccine.  COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) may  be given  once as a  booster to adults  that  have received  prior vaccination series with 
either mRNA  or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines. 
No dose adjustment  is  required  in elderly  individuals  .?:  65  years  of  age and  the vaccine is  not indicated  in 
paediatric population. 
This  is  the  i st single assessment of PSUR submitted for  VidPrevtyn  Beta (COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted)),  the covered  period  of this PSUSA is  from  10  November 2022  to 09 May 2023.

Post-marketing experience 
Exposure data based on administered doses when available have been retrieved from publicly available 
data sources such as national or international COVID-19 vaccination trackers.  For EU/ European Economic 
Area  (EEA) countries, administered doses are retrieved from the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control  (ECDC)  Vaccine Tracker. 
The number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted)  administered per European country

For the United Kingdom (UK), COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered doses are 
received directly from the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy from the UK 
government. Of note, COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) doses administered in Scotland, 
Wales and North Ireland are not included. The number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) administered in England per age group as of 07 May 2023 are presented in Table 3.

The total number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered is approximately 
1  636 959 up to 07 May 2023. 
Post-approval use in special populations 
The MAH does not have access to exposure regarding use in special populations from the IBD of COVID-
19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) through the DLP of the PBRER except for elderly population as 
more than 99.8% of the exposure in England is in elderly population which represents 1 627 026 doses 
administered (60 years and older (Department for Business, Energy,  and Industrial Strategy from the UK 
government). 
Use in the pregnancy and breast-feeding is being studied in non-interventional studies with study ID 
VAT00012 and VAT00007 (not yet initiated). No exposure in these studies. In addition, feasibility of the 
study VAT00006 has been re-assessed. It has been considered  that VAT00006 is no longer an option,  and 
it has been cancelled. The rationale of this decision has been included in an Answers to Questions 
document submitted to European Medicines Agency (EMA) through a procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/005754/MEA/001). According to the review timetable, the Committee for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (CHMP) outcome is expected on 20 July 2023. 
Use in the immuno-compromised subjects is being studied in externally sponsored collaborative (ESC) 
studies with study ID VAT00027, VAT00028 and in non-interventional study ID VAT00007 (not yet 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report

initiated).  Cumulative exposure in these  studies  is 32 participants. 
Use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease  [COPD],  diabetes,  chronic  neurological  disease,  cardiovascular disorders  [CVD]) and Use in 
subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders  is  being  studied  in non-interventional  studies with 
study ID VAT00007  (not yet initiated).  No exposure  in this study. 
Use in elderly: 
In  the  UK, country where most doses were administered,  the  local  recommendation  is  targeting the 
population  aged 75-year-old and above. Thus,  most of the post-marketing cases are reported  in the older 
population with approximately  86%  of cases  reported in 70-year-old and above.  Safety data presented in 
this PBRER can be considered as  reflecting the safety data in this age group. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
1  636  959 doses  were  administrated  during the covered period.  Out of those,  6920 doses  were 
administrated in EU and 1  630  039 doses in England,  mostly in elderly  due to local recommendations.  Of 
note,  the doses administered in Scotland,  Wales  and North  Ireland are not included in  the  PSUR  which  is 
not further justified.  The MAH is  requested to  provide  information  why  the  exposures in  Scotland,  Wales 
and North Ireland were  not  included in  the  PSUR.  RSI 
Immuno-compromised subjects  are  studied in  3 studies  (VAT00027,  VAT00028,  VAT00007)  with 
cumulative  exposure  of 32 participants. 
No  exposure  was observed in pregnant and breast-feeding  women,  in  frail subjects  with  unstable  health 
conditions and co-morbidities  and in  subjects  with  autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.

A total of 902  cumulative SAEs were reported from MAH-sponsored clinical trials. 
A total of 1227 cumulative ARs have been reported,  all of which were reported during the  present

A total of 19 cumulative ARs have been reported,  all of which were reported  during  the present reporting 
period  for an unknown manufacturer  (UNK  MFR). 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A  total of 902  cumulative  SAEs  were reported from  the  MAH sponsored clinical trials  and 1 227 ADRs 
cumulatively have been  reported during  the reporting  interval from post-marketing  experience. 
The MAH provided a  review of reported cases separated into  3 sections,  i.e.,  Requests based on  the  core-
PRAC PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 16/83 
RMP guidance, Additional requests from EMA,  and the Requests of MHRA.  However,  the current ordering 
is  very confusing.  It is  not clarified by the MAH,  why all AESI stated in  the  list of AESI in  the  RMP  version 
1 . 0  are not included in  the section  "Requests  based  on  the core-RMP guidance" and why several AESI are 
not discussed in PSUR at all.  Please see section  2.3 for a  detailed assessment and PRAC Rapp's request to 
the next PSUR. 
A new important safety information  was identified by the Rapp regarding the ADR of dizziness. A  total of 
40 cases concerning  dizziness  were reported during the  covered period as well as cumulatively.  1 6  (40%) 
of all these cases were reported as serious and 24 cases as non-serious.  The MAH provided the individual 
review of the serious cases only,  even  though dizziness is usually non-serious,  subjective,  temporary, 
self-limited,  short-term  reaction and most cases being reported as non-serious can  be expected. 
However,  in all described cases,  dizziness occurred in the first days after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn 
Beta.  Moreover,  the Rapp concluded that 9 serious cases are  probably related to  VidPrevtyn  Beta 
especially based on  the close  time relationship and simultaneous occurrence of other possible symptoms 
of reactogenicity.  Please see section  2.3.2.3.  for the PRAC Rapp's assessment of serious cases of 
dizziness. 
The PRAC Rapporteur considers a  causal relationship  between  VidPrevtyn  Beta  and dizziness is at least a 
reasonable possibility.  Dizziness should be included in the product information.  The MAH is requested to 
propose a frequency of this new adverse reaction  based on  the  available data. 
1.3.5.  Findings from clinical trials and other sources 
1.3.5.1.  Clinical  trials 
Completed clinical trials 
During the  reporting interval of this PBRER,  no clinical trials have been completed. 
Ongoing clinical trials 
VATOOOOl 
A parallel group,  Phase 1/11, first in human,  placebo controlled,  dose ranging,  multi-center study with a 
Sentinel Safety  Cohort and Early  Safety Data  Review  (ESDR)  to assess  immunogenicity  and safety of 
SARS-CoV-2  recombinant  protein vaccine formulations  (two antigen formulations  [high  or low dose]  with 
either AF03  or AS03  as adjuvants,  or no adjuvant for the high antigen dose formulation)  and injection 
schedule  (one or two injections)  in healthy adults 18  years  of age and older.  All vaccination in the study 
occurred  prior to the  review  period.  The safety  follow-up  period of the study has been completed.  No 
safety issue was identified during the long-term  safety follow-up. The clinical study report is currently 
under development. 
VAT00002 
A Phase II randomized,  modified double-blind,  multicenter, dose finding study has been conducted in 
adults  18 years of age and older to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two 
injections of 5  µg,  10 µg,  or  15  µg of the CoV2  pres  dTM  (D614)  vaccine,  adjuvanted with  AS03.  Interim 
data from this Phase II study was used to decide on progression to Phase III and to select an antigen

dose formulation for further clinical development evaluating the vaccines when used as a late booster. 
Supplemental cohorts were tested as part of VAT00002  Phase II/III study to  address various prime boost 
options  (the Monovalent B. 1.351  [Beta variant]  formulation was used in  the Supplemental Phase III 
Cohort 2). 
•  Supplemental Phase III  Cohort 1 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
the parental strain  (Monovalent D614)  vaccine among adults previously vaccinated with a primary 
series of mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech  or Moderna) or adenovirus-vectored  vaccines (Janssen or 
AstraZeneca). 
•  Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
a variant vaccine  (Monovalent B. 1.351 [Beta variant] or Bivalent  [D614/B. 1.351]) in adults 
previously primed with mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines. 
• 
In addition,  available and willing individuals previously primed with the adjuvanted recombinant 
protein vaccine  (different formulations)  as part of the Phase II Original Cohort were enrolled into 
the Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and randomized to a booster dose of the parental strain 
booster vaccine or Monovalent variant booster vaccine. 
•  Selection of the 5  µg dose was based on the  immunogenicity  results in non-naive participants of 
the original  cohort of VAT00002. 
•  All  vaccination for the Original Phase II cohort  (primary series) occurred prior to the review 
period.  The safety follow-up of the Original Cohort was completed prior to the review period.  No 
related SAEs and no AESI reported in the original cohort.  No safety issue was identified for the 
Original Cohort following completion of the safety follow-up. 
•  Vaccination for the Supplemental Cohorts in  the Phase III portion of the VAT00002 study occurred 
prior to the review period. Overall, no safety concerns were  identified,  nor any specific risk group 
identified for whom safety was of concern.  Among  participants  receiving  booster vaccine,  there 
was a favourable safety profile. The safety profile was consistent across booster formulations.  No 
safety issues were identified in subgroups  (defined by age or the presence of a  high-risk  medical 
condition).  These safety data were supportive of the use of the vaccine as a booster,  regardless of 
priming vaccine. The safety data were consistent with and further supports the safety profile 
established with the primary series formulation seen in  the VAT00002 Phase II  Original  Cohort 
and other studies. 
VATOOOOS 
This is a phase III randomized, modified double-blind,  placebo-controlled, multi-stage,  multi-center, 
multi-country study being conducted to  assess the efficacy,  safety,  and immunogenicity of two CoV2 pres 
dTM-AS03 vaccines  (Monovalent  [original variant first identified in Wuhan;  D614]  and Bivalent; 
D614/B.1.351) in adults  18 years of age and older with two stages as a primary series and open-label 
extension to assess  immunogenicity,  safety, efficacy of a Monovalent  (B.1.351) booster dose of SARS­
CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine. 
• 
For stage  1,  10  µg antigen Monovalent  D614  adjuvanted vaccine is evaluated against placebo. 
This antigen dose level selection mitigates the risk of having lower antibody  (Ab) titers against 
variants that would be circulating at the time of the efficacy study with potential to result in lower 
observed  vaccine  efficacy  (VE) for the  Monovalent  D614 vaccine. 
PRAC PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 18/83 
• 
For stage 2,  five  µg  (D614 component)  + five  µg (B.1.351 component) antigen dose  (Bivalent 
[D614/B.1.351] adjuvanted vaccine) is evaluated against placebo. It is reasonable to  expect that 
similar homologous responses would be elicited by  the B.1.351 component of the bivalent 
vaccine. Thus, by design, the inclusion of the B.1.351 antigen with the D614 antigen in the 
bivalent vaccine mitigates the risk of lower Ab responses against circulating variants anticipated 
with the Monovalent D614 vaccine. 
•  A booster extension:  all participants enrolled in Stages 1 and 2 are offered a Monovalent 
(B.1.351) booster dose if they are eligible and if they  consent to receive it. A safety follow-up of 
12 months after booster administration is implemented  (unsolicited  AE,  medically attended 
adverse  event  [MAAE],  SAE,  and adverse event of special interest  [AESI]). 
No safety concern was raised from the VAT00008  study for the monovalent or bivalent vaccine 
formulations. 
There was no new clinically important information arising from studies ongoing during the  reporting 
interval. 
Long-term follow-up 
No significant safety findings have been  identified  during the reporting interval in the  long-term  follow-up 
in  studies VAT00002  and VAT00008. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
3 clinical  trials  (VAT00001,  VAT00002,  VATO000B)  were  ongoing  during  the covered period.  No study has 
been  completed.  VAT00001,  Phase I study,  is the first in  human study,  two antigen  formulations  were 
studied  with  the  adjuvant AF03,  AS03 or  without any  adjuvant.  No  safety issue  was  identified during  the 
safety follow-up and the  clinical  study  report  is  currently  under development.  VAT00002,  Phase II study 
evaluated three antigen  (D614)  formulations  with  the adjuvant AS03.  5 microgram formulation  was 
selected based on  the result of the study for the assessment in  the  phase  3.  In  the  VAT00002 Phase 11/111 
study supplemental cohorts  were  studied to  address  booster options.  Supplemental Phase Ill  Cohort 1 
evaluated the parental strain  (monovalent antigen  D614) and Supplemental Phase Ill  Cohort 2  evaluated 
the  monovalent Beta  variant antigen  (B. 1 . 351)  or bivalent vaccine  (antigens  D614/B. 1 . 351).  All 
vaccinations  were  made  before  the  covered period and no safety issue was identified.  VATO000B Phase Ill 
study evaluated  1 0  microgram monovalent antigen  D614 in  stage  1  and bivalent formulation  (5 
microgram  D61 4  antigen +  5 microgram  B. 1 . 351  antigen)  in  stage 2.  In  the  booster extension  of the 
study monovalent B. 1 . 351  antigen  was  evaluated.  No  important safety issue  was identified. 
1.3.5.2.  Non-interventional studies 
During  the  reporting interval,  one non-interventional study  was  ongoing. 
VAT00012:  This is an international, non-interventional, post-marketing cohort study designed to collect 
prospective safety data among women vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy or within 
30  days prior to the first day  of the last menstrual period  (LMP). 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 19/83 
The  study  population  includes two  cohorts of pregnant women  18  years  of age and  older matched  by 
country and  gestational  age  (±two  weeks) : 
•  Cohort  1 :  pregnant women  exposed from  30  days  prior to  the  fi rst  day of the  LMP to  end of 
pregnancy to  at least one  dose  of a  COVID-19 vaccine. These  partici pants are  enrolled  as part of 
the  Coronavirus Disease-20 19 Vaccines International  Pregnancy  Exposure  Registry  (C-VIPER) . 
•  Cohort  2 :  pregnant women  unexposed to a  COVID-19 vaccine during  pregnancy. These 
pa rticipants  a re  enrolled  through the Pregistry  International  Pregnancy  Exposure  Reg istry with the 
same methods as those in Cohort 1 .  Women vaccinated before 30 days prior to the fi rst  day of 
the  LMP are  eligible for inclusion. 
The  tota l  d u ration of the  study is five years.  Obstetric,  neonatal, and  infant outcomes  will  be assessed on 
an  ongoing  basis as  data  become  avai lable.  Data on  pregnancy,  neonata l  and  infant outcomes wi l l  be 
included  in  the  interim  reports. 
There were no safety or efficacy find ings relevant to the  benefit-risk assessment identified  from  the  non­
interventional  study during the  reporting  interval .  
A listing of a l l  MAH -sponsored  non-interventional  studies completed o r  ongoing during the  reporting 
period, and  with the  primary aim of identifying, characterizing, quantifying  a  safety  hazard,  confi rming 
the safety  profi le of COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted), or measu ring  the effectiveness of risk 
management measu res  is presented  in Appendix 4 . 2 .  
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
One non-interventional study designed to collect prospective data among pregnant women is currently 
ongoing.  6000 subjects are planned to be enrolled.  No subjects  were  enrolled until  9 May 2023.

There were no safety or efficacy findings relevant to the benefit-risk assessment in other clinical trials or 
study sources during the reporting period. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
4 other clinical trials are ongoing.  In the study  VAT000027 including kidney transplant recipients,  subjects 
are currently being recruited.  Other 3 studies are ongoing and additional participants are not currently 
enrolled.  No  significant safety issue  was identified. 
1.3.5.4.  Medication  errors 
Out of the  18 cases of medication errors reported during the review period, nine (four serious and five 
non-serious) were reported with AEs (50 %) and nine cases with no reported AEs (50 %).

1.3.5.5. Literature 
In accordance with  the  GVP,  the  MAH  is  screening literature articles  to  search for  any  new  and  significant 
safety findings,  either  published  in the  peer-reviewed  scientific literature  or made  available  as 
unpublished manuscripts when relevant to the medicinal product.  If relevant and applicable,  information 
on  other active substances  of  the same class  should be considered. 
Commencement  of literature screening  has  been  determined  by  the  last  date  of  package  submission  of 
the MA application(s) for  COVID-19  vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted) (March  2022)  and a  broad 
strategy  has  been  applied with search criteria including any  COVID-19 vaccine product,  irrespective of 
manufacturer  or  vaccine  technology,  and  a report  of  AE(s)  without  restriction  by  seriousness or severity 
as stated  in  EU  Risk Management  Plan  (RMP)  version 1.0  DLP 08  November 2022.  In  the  Responses  to 
Pharmacovigilance  Risk Assessment  Committee (PRAC)  Rapporteur Rolling review  RMP  final assessment 
report  received  on 01 October 2021 and  in  EU  RMP  version 1.0  DLP  08  November  2022,  the  following  is 
stated :  "as  knowledge  of the SARS-CoV-2  virus,  COVID-19  and  vaccines  evolves,  it  is expected that  the 
above  strategies will likewise  change  evolve".  Indeed,  the  MAH  would  propose  to  implement  a focused 
strategy  with search criteria  on  protein and/or nano  particle and/or adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine  product 
now that  safety  profiles  of other COVID-19  vaccine platforms are considered  stabilized with millions  of 
doses distributed and  taken into account that  they  are closely monitored by their respective MAHs. 
During  the  reporting  period,  four publications identified from the  scientific (including non-clinical) and 
medical literature,  contained relevant safety findings summarized hereafter. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH proposes  to  change the search  strategy for screening  of the scientific  literature.  Currently,  the 
literature  is monitored for any COVID-1 9  vaccine  irrespective  of the platform.  The PRAC Rapp agrees  that 
the  monitoring  criteria  is too broad,  the  MAH should focus on  the scientific  literature  concerning  the 
vaccines  of the same  or similar platform  in  the next PSURs.  Next PSUR 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest - Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Macias Saint-Gerons D,  Ibarz  MT,  Castro J L,  Fores-Martos J,  Tabares-Seisdedos  R.  Myopericarditis 
Associated  with the  Novavax  COVID-19  Vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) :  A  Retrospective  Analysis  of Individual 
Case Safety  Reports from VigiBase.  Drugs  Real World  Outcomes. 2023  Jun;10(2): 263-70. 
The authors presented  a retrospective analysis of myopericarditis,  an AESI,  associated with a  protein  sub­
unit vaccine,  NOVAVAX®  (NVX-CoV2373), reported to the World Health  Organization  (WHO)  global safety 
database and compared  to the rates  reported  with other  COVID-19  vaccines.  From 31  703  998  ICSRs, 
there were 61 812  ICSRs  of  myopericarditis and  61 were  reported  for NOVAVAX vaccine. Out of  61 
included  cases,  45  reported pericarditis, 11 myocarditis,  four myopericarditis  and  one both terms 
(myocarditis and  pericarditis).  Most  of  the cases were  reported  from Australia  (82%).  The median  age  of 
individuals  was  35.5  years  old,  and  most  were  males  (38 ;  62.3%). Twenty-four (24)  reports (39.3%) 
were considered serious,  none of  them were fatal.  The median induction  period for myopericarditis from 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report

vaccination  (after the most recent immunization) estimated  from  40  ICSRs,  was three  days.  Increased 
disproportionality  for  myopericarditis  was found  for  NVXCoV2373  (Reporting Odds Ratio  [ROR]  14.47, 
95% confidence  interval  [CI]  11.22-18.67) and mRNA  vaccines:  BNT162b2  (ROR  17.15,  95%  CI 16.88-
17.42)  and  mRNA-1273  (ROR 6.92, 95%  CI  6.77-7.08). Higher values were found  in males. 
Disproportionality  for the  NVX-CoV2373  vaccine was  found  in  the age  groups  18-44 and 45-65  years  in 
both  sexes,  but with  higher  values  in  males.  Chest  pain  was  the most  common  co-reported  event 43 
(70.5%). The adenoviral vector-based  vaccine Ad26.COV2.S  showed  slightly  increased  disproportionality 
(ROR 1.83, 95%  CI 1. 70-1.98),  whereas  no  increased  disproportionality was found  for ChAdOxl 
adenoviral  vector-based  vaccine. The authors concluded  that  new  NVX-CoV2373  vaccine  shows  an 
increased  disproportionality for myopericarditis similar to mRNA vaccines. 
MAH  Comment:  Based  on  the  study  conducted  by  the authors suggesting an increased  disproportionality 
with the  protein  sub-unit  vaccines.  However,  a  greater risk of  hospitalization  and  death has  been 
observed in  association  with COVID-19  infection  than  with the vaccination. This study  also had  several 
limitations.  The  data source for the  study  was retrieved  from spontaneous reports  database  from which 
no  definitive causal associations can  be  drawn.  Relevant information  such as viral  testing for myocarditis 
was lacking from  the reports. In  addition,  the  exact mechanism of action  for vaccine-induced 
myopericarditis  remains  to be  elucidated.  More  evidence from  controlled  studies  is  necessary. 
Myocarditis/  Pericarditis  is  already  an  important  potential  risk for COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted ).  Please also refer  Section  16.3  and  Section  16.4 for details. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH provided an  analysis  of the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis  with  Nuvaxovid concluding  that 
increased disproportionality of myocarditis  is similar to  mRNA  vaccines.  The causal relationship of 
myocarditis/pericarditis  with  Nuvaxovid was already established with  frequency not known.  1  case report 
of myocarditis  was received during the covered period for VidPrevtyn  Beta,  please see  the section

Nafar  M,  Mostafaloo  N,  Firouzan  A,  Poorrezagholi  F,  Samadian  F,  Dalili  N,  et  al.  Immunogenicity and 
Safety of SpikoGen,  an Adjuvanted  Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike  Protein,  as a  Heterologous Third 
Booster Dose  in  Kid ney Transplant  Patients:  A Single-arm  Clinical Trial.  Clinical Therapeutics. 2022 Dec 
1; 44(12) : 1566-76. 
The authors  assessed  the immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the SpikoGen® vaccine as a  third  booster dose in 
special patient population (43 patients undergoing kidney transplant receiving  immunosuppressive 
therapy)  at a referral center  for kidney transplantation  in  Iran.  The  patients had  received  their  primary 
vaccination  based  on  an  inactivated  whole  virus  platform (Sinopharm)  one to three months  earlier. 
SpikoGen  is  a subunit recombinant S  protein  vaccine combined  with Advax-CpG55.2 TM  adjuvant,  a 
microcrystalline polysaccharide  particle  engineered  from  delta  inulin. The most  common  local  and 
systemic  reported  solicited  AEs were injection  site  pain  in 19 patients (44.19%) and fatigue in  10 
(23.26%), which  were  largely mild  and transient.  No  SAEs  were  reported. 
MAH  Comment:  In this article,  the authors  performed  a single-arm,  open-label,  prospective clinical  trial 
including 43  patients  with SpikoGen  (adjuvanted  recombinant S  protein  trimer vaccine). The authors 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 24/83 
observed  that a  single booster dose of  the vaccine  given  one to three months after  primary  vaccination 
with two  doses  of Sinopharm vaccine induced positive humeral and cellular immune responses in 
immunosuppressed  patients  undergoing  renal transplant,  thereby  achieving S Ab levels  predictive  of 
protection.  While  positive responses  are  observed,  the number of transplant patients was relatively  low 
and there was no control group.  In addition, this was  a  single-center study.  Further information  would  be 
needed from  larger,  multicenter studies to  extend  these results.  Use in  immunocompromised  subjects  is a 
missing  information  for COVID-19  vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Please  refer  Section  16.3  and 
Section  16.4  for details. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH provided a safety analysis  of an adjuvanted recombinant vaccine SpikoGen  used as a  booster 
dose  in patients  with  immunosuppression  after kidney transplant.  The majority of solicited local and 
systemic adverse  events  were  injection  site pain  and fatigue  and were  mostly mild and transient.  No 
serious  adverse  events  were  reported.  Injection  site  pain  and fatigue  are listed adverse  reactions  of 
VidPrevtyn  Beta. 
Special  population - Pregnant women 
Cole C,  Tsakiroglou  M,  Waitt C.  Communication  is crucial :  Lessons from  COVID-19  vaccination and 
pregnancy.  Br J  Clin  Pharmacol.  2023  Feb;89(2):582-93.  (8) 
The  authors presented findings  from  the systematic review  and meta-analysis concerning pregnancy 
outcomes following  COVID-19  vaccination  with  BNT162b2,  Moderna,  ChAdOxl  and Janssen  vaccines from 
multiple  studies.  No difference in maternal  outcomes,  neonatal outcomes  or AEs  and no  increased risks  in 
pregnant  women  or  neonates were found  in  vaccinated women compared  to  non-vaccinated. 
MAH  Comment:  Based  on  the systematic review of safety outcomes associated with COVID-19  vaccines, 
this  article  summarizes key  aspects  and  outcomes  due  to COVID-19  vaccination  during  pregnancy.  For a 
vast majority  of the  studies,  the  reported side-effects  in pregnant women were similar  to the general 
population  and no significant  impact on  the adverse maternal  or fetal  outcomes  were  observed with the 
vaccines.  The various  studies  and  recommendations further affirm that  COVID-19  vaccines reduce the 
risk of  hospitalizations and deaths  in  pregnant women as in the nonpregnant  population. The authors 
highlight the importance  of advice and reassurance on the safety  of  COVID-19  vaccinations in pregnant 
population  for effective benefit-risk communication. Use  in  pregnant  women  and  while  breastfeeding is a 
missing  information  for  MAH  COVID-19  vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Please refer  Section  16.3  and 
Section  16.4  for details. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH provided an analysis  of the systematic review assessing pregnancy outcomes following 
vaccination  with  Comirnaty,  Spikevax,  Vaxzevria  and Jcovden  with  a  conclusion  that no  increased risk in 
pregnant  women  and neonates  was found. 
No  case concerning use  of VidPrevtyn  Beta  in pregnant women  has been  reported yet.

Tormen  M, Taliento C,  Salvioli S, Piccolotti  I,  Scutiero  G,  Cappadona  R,  et  al.  Effectiveness  and  safety  of 
COVID-19  vaccine in  pregnant women:  A systematic review with meta-analysis.  BJOG.  2023 
Mar; 130( 4) : 348-57. 
The authors presented a systematic review and meta-analysis of pregnancy outcomes and risk of 
pregnancy related complications in COVID-19 vaccinated pregnant population with Pfizer,  AstraZeneca, 
and Jansen vaccines  (no  protein-based  vaccine included  in  the analysis)  and  a comparison  to 
unvaccinated  population.  Administration  of a  COVID-19  vaccine during  pregnancy  resulted  in  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  in  SARS-CoV-2  infection and COVID-19-related  hospitalizations,  but  the 
certainty  of  evidence  was very low. The effect  appeared  to  be  greater  for both infection and 
hospitalizations when  considering  only  fully  vaccinated women,  although  the level  of certainty  was  still 
very low.  Conversely,  the difference in  Intensive  Care  Unit (ICU)  admissions related to COVID-19  did not 
reach  statistical significance,  likely due to  the small number  of total cases of both vaccinated and 
unvaccinated women.  Nine (9) studies evaluated fetal complications  occurring during pregnancy  in 
vaccinated versus unvaccinated women.  No significant differences were observed for the following 
outcomes:  pregnancy  loss,  fetal abnormalities,  small for gestational age,  intrauterine growth restriction, 
preterm birth,  stillbirth,  meconium-stained amniotic fluid,  neonatal  ICU  admission and hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy  between  vaccinated and unvaccinated  women. 
MAH  comment :  It was concluded that COVID-19 vaccination administered during pregnancy seems  to 
reduce SARS-CoV-2  infection and COVID-19-related  hospitalization,  with no significant  effects  on 
maternal-fetal complications  (9).  However,  the  certainty  of  evidence was low as  the  data  was identified 
from  observational studies.  Use in  pregnant  women  and while  breastfeeding  is a missing  information  for 
MAH  COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Please refer Section 16.3  and Section  16.4 for details. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The systematic review of 14 observational studies including above 350 000 women assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of COVID-1 9 vaccines (Comirnaty,  Spikevax,  Vaxzevria  and Jcovden) in pregnant 
women.  There were no statistically significant differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated women 
in the observed maternal-foetal complications. 
No articles  on  patients  vaccinated with  protein-based vaccines  or COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) in  pregnant women were identified. 
1.3.5.6.  Other periodic reports 
During  the  reporting interval this  is  the  only  PBRER prepared  by  the MAH  for  this  product including 
periodic  reports  prepared  by  the contractual  partner. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No other periodic reports  were prepared during the covered period.

1.3.6.  Lack of efficacy in controlled clinical trials 
No new controlled clinical trials indicating a lack of efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted),  in the authorized indications,  relevant for  the  benefit-risk evaluation were identified during 
the reporting interval. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The information is acknowledged. 
1.3.7.  Late-breaking information 
Since the DLP for this PBRER,  the MAH has identified the following new information regarding potentially 
important safety and efficacy and/or effectiveness: 
One signal on allergic including anaphylactic reactions has  been opened on  17 May 2023,  validated on  14 
June 2023.  On 26 June 2023,  signal of allergic including anaphylactic reactions was confirmed as an 
identified risk. The weighted  cumulative  evidence was  considered sufficient  to support a causal 
association  between COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted)  and allergic including anaphylactic 
reactions that should  be reflected in the RSI. 
Regarding anaphylactic reactions,  highest levels of certainty for the diagnosis of  anaphylaxis  (levels 1 and 
2 of the Brighton Collaboration Case Definition  (BCCD)  [ 10]) were not reached  for any  case;  however 
anaphylactic reactions could  be expected after  any vaccination.  In addition, the pattern observed of 
allergic reactions reported after the use of COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted)  (rash,  urticaria, 
rash erythematous, pruritus, swelling face) supports the fact that the signal detected is judged  to  be of 
sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory  action and moves to full  evaluation and further  characterize 
allergic including anaphylactic reactions.  Further details regarding this signal will  be discussed in the next 
PBRER interval. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In August 2023 the MAH submitted a  variation  of the marketing authorisation  related to hypersensitivity 
reactions.  The issue  has  been  assessed in  a currently ongoing procedure  EMEA/H/C/005754/11/0006.  The 
information  about the  outcome of the signal and procedure  will be provided by MAH in  the next PSUR.

hypersensitivity,  which  is  currently reviewed via  separate procedure. 
2.3.  Evaluation  of risks and safety topics  under monitoring 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH divided the issues requested to be monitored in 3 sections in the PSUR  - Requests based on  the 
core-RMP guidance, Additional requests from EMA  and the Requests of MHRA.  It is not clear why not all 
AESI stated in  the list of AESI in the RMP version  1 . 0  are included in the section  "Requests  based on  the 
core-RMP guidance'�  The current structure is very confusing.  Therefore,  all AESI should be presented in 
one integrated overview and not split according  to  the origin  of the request (EMA,  MHRA,  RMP)  as  this 
makes  the  data  difficult to follow.  Next PSUR 
In  addition,  several AESI are  not discussed in  PSUR  at all  - acute septic arthritis,  rheumatoid arthritis, 
type 1  diabetes mellitus,  heart failure,  stress cardiomyopathy,  arrhythmias,  anosmia and ageusia.  The 
MAH is asked to include  the assessment of these AESI in  the next PSURs including  0/E analysis. In the 
next PSUR,  the cases reported during  the current and next PSUR period should be included.  Next  PSUR

2.3.1.1.  Anaphy/actic reactions 
Based  on the MedDRA search criteria SMQ Anaphylactic reaction Algorithmic, a total of five serious case 
reports of potential anaphylactic reactions were  retrieved  on the period; none met level  1  or  2 BCCD level 
for anaphylaxis. 
reported from an HCP via 
•  Case 
- and involving a 93-year-old -with an unspecified  ongoing food  allergy experienced back 
pain,  eye movement disorder, respiratory arrest, and erythema a couple of  minutes after receiving 
COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted). The patient was laid  down and recovered  10 mins later 
with  feet elevation.  Based on the limited reported  information, the role of the  individual suspect vaccine 
cannot be assessed.  This case was assessed as BCCD level 3 for  anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• was reported from an HCP via -·  A■■■■■■■■lwith no reported 
medical history experienced  acute anaphylaxis,  two min  after receiving COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted).  The patient was given adrenaline two times  (half an hour apart) and was transferred  to a 
hospital.  The patient recovered.  The concomitant medications included apixaban;  macrogol 3350, 
potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride; furosemide;  gabapentin; Hypromellose; 
omeprazole;  paracetamol and  cholecalciferol.  Further  information  regarding detailed symptoms, 
concurrent condition during  vaccination,  medical  history, tolerance of previous vaccinations, and 
investigations excluding alternative aetiologies for  the reported  event are needed  to fully assess this case. 
This case was assessed as BCCD level 4 for  anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• was reported from a consumer via -A 74-year-old-with no reported 
medical history developed d izziness,  dyspnea, erythema, miliaria, and  asthenia one day after vaccination 
with  COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted). Patient's past vaccination was COVID- 19 vaccine 
Moderna,  and  past medications included atorvastatin,  clopidogrel for cerebrovascular accident and 
paracetamol for headache.  Concomitant medications included  lisinopril for  blood  pressure;  pantoprazole 
for  gastroesophageal  reflux disease;  and venlafaxine for depression. Patient was reported  as recovering. 
Based  on the reported information, the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. This 
case was assessed  as BCCD level 4 for anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• was reported by a consumer via - and  involves a  77-year-old-..,,ith 
medical history of bronchitis improved after d iet, gastritis and  ongoing glaucoma who experienced 
coughing, influenza, headache, flushing and  productive cough two  days after receiving the vaccine. The 
patient also experienced  fatigue  unknown  duration after the vaccination. The patient was treated with 
paracetamol for headache. The patient recovered from coughing and had not recovered from influenza, 
productive  cough, fatigue, flushing and  headache.  The patient's past medical history of bronchitis could 
be a confounding factor. Based  on  the reported  information, the role of suspect cannot be assessed.  This 
case was assessed  as BCCD level 5 for anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• was reported from a consumer via - An unknown  age -with no reported 
medical history developed diarrhea on the day of  vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted).  Patient also developed  pruritus,  pharyngeal swelling, vaccination site bruising, vaccination 
site warmth and  lymphadenopathy unknown duration after the vaccination.  The patient's past 
vaccinations were not reported.  Outcome was reported  as not recovered for vaccination  site  bruising, 
vaccination site warmth, diarrhea and  unknown for pruritus, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngeal swelling.

Based  on the minimal  information reported, the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. 
This case was assessed  as BCCD level 4 for anaphylaxis. 
In addition to Anaphylactic reactions specific analysis,  17 cases including seven serious and 10 non­
serious cases reported  swelling face/angioedema based  on the MedDRA search strategy for SMQ: 
"Angioedema" (Narrow); none met BCCD level 1 or 2 for anaphylaxis. 
Based  on medical  review of cumulative  data, a signal on Allergic including anaphylactic reactions has 
been opened  on  17 May  2023  and has been validated on  14 June 2023. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Five cases reporting anaphylaxis  were received during the covered period.  All cases include only limited 
information.  Two  cases  were reported by healthcare professionals.  In  the first case,  it is not clear if 
respiratory arrest occurred.  Elevation  of the patient's feet is  described as the  only  treatment (BCC Level 
4). In the second case,  no symptoms of anaphylaxis are described (BCC level 4). 
In one consumer case, only dyspnoea is described as a symptom  of anaphylaxis (BCC level 4), in the 
second case the reactions seem  to  be rather the symptoms of viral infection  which appeared two days 
after vaccination  (BCC level 5).  In  the last consumer case,  diarrhoea, pruritus  without further 
specification  and pharyngeal swelling are described.  The PRAC Rapp disagrees  with  the MAH ' s 
assessment that this case is of BCC level 4.  The case should be assessed as of level 2 certainty,  the 
patient experienced one major respiratory symptom  (pharyngeal swelling)  and two minor symptoms 
(pruritus  and diarrhoea). 
Most reported cases of anaphylaxis  and angioedema are of limited information precluding in depth 
assessment.  Generally,  the MAH is requested to make  an  effort in  order to  obtain  maximum available 
information  during the follow-ups and to  discuss  the updated cases in  view of the new information 
including causality assessment.  Next PSUR 
The MAH is  requested to  submit a re-evaluation  of all  cases reported with  'Allergic and anaphylactic 
reactions' with  an  outcome as ongoing or not recovered within  the next PSUR,  once further information 
(on  the patient's underlying disease conditions,  past medical and drug history,  concurrent illnesses,  and 
concomitant medications) is  available.  Next PSUR 
In  addition,  1 7  cases of angioedema  were  received during  the  reporting period,  which  are  described in  the 
section  2. 3.2.2. 
In August 2023 the MAH submitted a  variation  of the marketing authorisation  related to  hypersensitivity 
reactions.  The issue  has  been  assessed in  a  separate procedure EMEA/H/C/005754/II/0006, angioedema 
has been covered by this assessment. 
The MAH should continue to present anaphylactic reactions in  the PSUR. 
2.3. 1.2.  Myocarditis/Pericarditis 
One case of  myocarditis was retrieved for COVID- 19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) during the 
reference period. The serious case report of myocarditis was reported from  consumer  via - in an 
elderly patient of  unknown gender two  days  after  vaccination.  An  8 1-year-old  and  unknown gender 
patient experienced positional dizziness and myocarditis two days after vaccination with COVID-19

vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  At  time  of reporting, the outcome was not  recovered.  Further 
information on patient underlying disease condition, past medical and drug history,  concomitant 
medications,  description of the reported symptoms,  complementary  investigations and results excluding 
alternative aetiologies for the reported event are needed to fully assess this case.  Based upon the 
reported information,  the role  of the individual suspect vaccine  cannot be assessed. This case was 
assessed as BCCD level 4 for myocarditis. 
In addition, no increased  0/E ratio has been detected for myocarditis/pericarditis. 
•  Conclusion:  Based on medical review of  cumulative data supported by 0/E analysis,  no safety concern 
has been identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
One case of myocarditis  was reported during the covered period and also cumulatively.  It is a consumer 
case with  limited information,  no information  about the symptoms,  the results  of the laboratory tests, 
virology,  ECG,  ECHO  or MRI and treatment was provided (BCC level of certainty 4).  The MAH is  requested 
to  follow-up  this  case in order to obtain all available information  and to  discuss the  updated case in detail 
in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR 
In  addition,  the MAH specified the risk  window for O/E analysis  as  follows:  the primary risk  window as  1 -7 
days and the secondary risk  window as 1-42 days.  The PRAC Rapp does not agree  with  the MAH , s 
proposal.  The highest risk of myocarditis/pericarditis  following mRNA  vaccines and Nuvaxovid is within  14 
days after vaccination.  The proposed primary risk window is  too short.  The PRAC Rapp proposes to  extent 
the primary risk window to  28 days as is stated in  the protocol V2.2 for Rapid safety assessment of SARS­
CoV-2  vaccines in EU Member States using electronic health  care  data  sources,  ENCEPP.  Next PSUR 
2.3. 1.3.  COVID-19 AESI 
A total eight case reports  of  COVID-19 infection were reported,  of  which two were reported as  serious 
case reports and are detailed below.  No fatal outcomes or severe  cases were being  reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please refer regarding COVID-1 9 cases to the section 2.4. 1 .  Important potential risks 
2.3. 1.4.  Dermatological AESis  (including  Chilblains,  Erythema  Multiforme,  Stevens .Johnson 
Syndrome and Toxic  Epidermal Necrolysis) 
No  cases reporting these reactions have been identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No cases of Chilblain-like  lesions,  Erythema multiforme,  Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal 
Necrolysis  were reported. 
The MAH should continue to present dermatological AESis  in  the PSUR.

2.3.1.5.  Facial paralysis  (Bell's palsy) 
No case report of facial paralysis  (Bell's Palsy)  has been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  cases  of facial paralysis  were reported.  The MAH should continue to present data  on  facial paralysis  in 
the  PSUR. 
2.3. 1.6.  Hepatic AESis 
No case report of  hepatic AESI has been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  cases  of Acute liver injury  were  reported. 
For the purposes of 0/E analysis,  the  MAH determined the primary risk  window as  1 -1 4  days.  The  PRAC 
Rapp is of opinion  that the proposed risk window is too short and proposes to  extend the primary risk 
window to  1 80 days  in  next PSURs in  line  with  the  protocol V2.2.  for Rapid safety assessment of SARS­
CoV-2  vaccines in EU Member States  using  electronic health  care  data  sources,  ENCEPP.  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue to present hepatic AESI in  the PSUR. 
2.3.1.7.  Pregnancy related AESis 
There was no reported use in pregnancy. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
No  cases  of pregnancy related AESI were reported. 
The MAH should continue to present related AESI in  the subsequent PSUR. 
2.3.1.B.  Respiratory AESis 
Based on the  MedDRA search strategy focused on acute respiratory distress syndrome, three serious case 
reports of respiratory AESis were identified:  one case of respiratory arrest <•••••■) also reported 
hypersensitivity manifestations and is presented  under Anaphylactic reactions,  one case  <•••••■) 
reported seizures along with respiratory arrest and it is presented below  under "Seizures" Section and 
remaining  one case of  severe  acute  respiratory  distress syndrome <••••••■) is presented here. 
•  Case •••••• reported by a consumer via - referred to a 77-year-old-with medical 
history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hype�terolemia, who experienced SARS-CoV-1 
infection  (SARS)  14 days  after  vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted)  and SARS­
CoV-2 infection  (confirmed by test  but no test result was provided)  15 days after vaccination. The 
concomitant medications included apixaban for atrial fibrillation;  atorvastatin for blood cholesterol

increased;  bisoprolol for heart rate increased; and ramipril for hypertension. Symptoms were extreme 
coughing, sneezing, runny nose, shortness of breath  and difficulty breathi n g  for which the patient was 
g iven a ntibiotics to prevent chest infection. The outcome was reported  as not recovered from  SARS and 
recovering from  COVID-19.  Further information  regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  history, other risk 
factors,  complementary examination  results and  time of first symptoms appearance for the reported 
event are  needed to  fully assess this case.  Based  upon  the  reported  information, the  role of the  individual 
suspect vaccine cannot be assessed, and a  potential vaccination failure cannot be retained .  This case was 
assessed  as BCCD  level  5 for VAED. 
Based  on  medical  review of cumulative data,  no safety issue on  respiratory AESis has been identified .  In 
addition, no increased observed versus expected  (0/E)  ratio has been  detected for respiratory AESis. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Within  respiratory AESI,  2 cases of respiratory arrest and 1  case of ARDS were reported.  2 cases are 
medically confirmed and 1  case  from a  consumer.  The first HCP case  was already discussed in  the section 
2.3. 1 . 1 .  Anaphylactic reaction.  It is not clear if respiratory arrest occurred.  Elevation  of the patient 's feet 
is  described as the only treatment (BCC Level 4).  In  the second HCP case listed which  is  presented by the 
MAH in  the section  of seizures,  respiratory arrest and seizures occurred 1 0  minutes after vaccination  with 
VidPrevtyn  Beta.  Adrenaline  was  administered due  to anaphylaxis and the patient was  intubated and 
transferred to  the emergency room.  (BCC Level 4). It is  not clear why this  case  was not discussed as 
anaphylaxis.  The MAH is  requested to  follow-up  the case •••••• in  order to  obtain all available 
information  and to discuss the updated case in  detail in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR In  the consumer 
case, a patient experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection  two weeks after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta  (BCC 
Level 5). 
For the purposes of O/E analysis,  the MAH determined the primary risk window of Acute respiratory 
distress syndrome as  0-14  days.  The PRAC Rapp does not agree with  the MAH · s proposal.  The MAH 
states that the primary risk  window was determined based on  the SPEAC AESI Case Definition  Companion 
Guide for ARDS  (Version  1 . 0),  however,  in the section  4. 1 . 3  Recommendation  for duration  of surveillance 
it is specifically stated:  "If immunization leads to direct lung injury (via  stimulation of innate or adaptive 
immune mechanisms), ARDS would be expected to  occur within  1  to  6  weeks after vaccine 
administration.

) was reported from an  HCP via 
One  serious  case of myocardial infarction  ( 
involving  a 78-year-old non-tobacco user- with ongoing  chronic kidney disease, who experienced 
myocardial infarction one day after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). 
Diagnosis was myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries  (MINOCA).  There was medical 
history that relates to previous venous or arterial thromboses.  The patient did not  confirm or  suspect 
autoimmune or inflammatory disease, including vasculitis.  No hemorrhage was identified.  As per reporter, 
this case report was not  related to possible blood  clots or  low platelet counts or possible myocarditis or 
pericarditis. At time of reporting,  the  outcome  was recovered/resolved.  Further  information regarding 
concomitant medication  and tolerance, laboratory investigations excluding alternative  aetiologies for the 
reported event are needed to fully assess this case.  Based on the reported information,  the role of the 
individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed.  This case was assessed as  BCCD level 5 for 
Thrombosis/Thromboembolism. 
Based on the medical review of  the case report, no safety  concern has been identified. In addition, no 
increased  0/E  ratio has been detected for  coronary artery  disease AESI.  Refer to Appendix 6.4.2. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
One case  reporting  myocardial infarction  with  nonobstructive  coronary arteries  (MINOCA)  was reported 
during  the reporting period.  No  results  of the performed examinations were provided,  however,  the 
reporter (HCP)  stated that no haemorrhage,  blood clots,  myocarditis  or pericarditis  were identified. 
MINOCA is  a syndrome  with  many causes.  Its prevalence ranges between  5 and 25%  of all Mls.  The 
prognosis is extremely  variable,  depending  on  the causes of MINOCA.  Clinical history,  echocardiography, 
coronary angiography,  and le� ventriculography represent the  first-level diagnostic investigations. 
Nevertheless,  additional tests are required in order to establish  its specific  cause,  thus allowing an 
appropriate  risk stratification  and treatment.  The  causes specified in UpToDate are following:  Coronary 
artery spasm,  Acute  thrombosis at the site  of non -obstructive  eccentric plaque  thrombosis,  Spontaneous 
coronary artery dissection,  Takotsubo  cardiomyopathy,  Coronary microvascular dysfunction,  Viral 
myocarditis  and  Coronary artery embolism.  The MAH is asked to make an  effort in  order to obtain  all 
available  details  of the case including  clinical course,  results  of the performed examinations and diagnosis 
and  to  discuss the  updated case  in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue  to  present data  on  coronary artery disease in  the PSUR. 
2.3.1.11.  Thrombosis  with  thrombocytopaenia syndrome 
No case report of thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia syndrome was  reported,  however,  one  case report of 
deep vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  thrombocytopenia has  been reported.  It  is  presented below in Section 
"Thromboembolic AESis (venous thromboembolism)". 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH determined the primary risk  window of thrombosis  with  thrombocytopenia  syndrome as  1 -1 4  
days and the secondary risk  window a s  1 -28 days.  The PRAC Rapp  does not agree  with  the proposed 
primary risk  window.  Most of the cases following  vaccination  with  vector COVID-1 9  vaccines occurred 
within  the first three  weeks following  vaccination.  The PRAC Rapp  therefore proposes to  extend the 
primary risk window to 28  days as is also stated in  the protocol  V2. 2.  for Rapid safety assessment of

2.3.1. 12.  Thromboembolic AESis  (venous thromboembolism) 
Six serious cases reported different types of thromboembolic AESis,  one  reported pulmonary embolism, 
one reported DVT, three reported thrombosis,  and one fatal case reported cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis (CVST) and were assessed against BCCD for thrombosis/thromboembolism: 
•  Case •••••• reported pulmonary embolism from an  HCP via 1111 A 75-year-old -
experienced pulmonary embolus  (Diagnosed through Computerized Tomography  [CT]  pulmonary 
angiogram)  five  days after vaccination with COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). The patient 
had difficulty breathing and chest discomfort.  Fibrin D dimer was not  >  4000  (poorly documented but 
pathologic or imaging findings consistent with  thromboembolism:  diagnosed through CT pulmonary 
angiogram).  At the time  of reporting,  the outcome was recovering  (no  information about corrective 
measurements was provided). Previous and current laboratory  investigations including  Fibrin D Dimer 
date  (results  which were  reported  as not  >  4000  [Units not provided]), excluding alternative aetiologies 
for the reported event are needed to fully assess this case. Based on the reported information, the role of 
the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed.  This case report meets BCCD level  1,  considering 
diagnostic confirmation and experienced symptoms,  however there  is a lack of  information on the 
patient's medical history,  concomitant medications,  and primary vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. 
•  Case •••••• reported DVT  received from other  HCP  via- An  88-years-ol� 
experienced DVT five days after vaccination with  COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  The 
concomitant medications included allopurinol;  aspirin; felodipine;  folic acid;  furosemide;  glyceryl 
trinitrate;  paracetamol;  salbutamol;  and beclomethasone dipropionate,  formoterol fumarate, 
glycopyrronium bromide. At the time of reporting, the outcome was recovering.  Further  information 
regarding  previous COVID- 19 vaccinations,  indication of reported concomitant medications including 
aspirin, medical history and risk factors,  laboratory  investigations and context for the reported event are 
needed to fully assess this case. Based upon the reported  information, the role of the individual suspect 
vaccine cannot be assessed.  This case meets BCCD level 4 for thrombosis/thromboembolism. 
•  Thrombosis was reported in three cases: 
- Case •••••• involving  an 8 6-year-old- who  experienced thrombus two days after 
vaccination with COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Symptoms were reported to be acute 
onset pain,  paralysis,  and numbness.  A CT scan  confirmed acute thrombus in right axillary artery. The 
patient had ongoing macular  degeneration,  hypertension and previous DVT/pulmonary embolism which 
constitutes a pre-existing risk factor. The patient  had ongoing macular degeneration, hypertension and 
previous DVT/pulmonary embolism which constitutes a pre-existing risk factor. Further  information 
regarding previous COVID- 19 vaccinations, concomitant medications and other risk factors, 
complementary examination results and context for the reported event are needed to fully assess this 
case.  Based on the  reported information,  the role of the individual suspect  vaccine  cannot be excluded. 
This case was assessed as BCCD level  1 for thrombosis/thromboembolism.

- Case •••••• was  reported  from a  consumer via -and  referred  to a�f an  unknown 
age who experienced  dyspnea,  abdominal  pain,  and  blood  clots two  days  after vaccination with  COVID-19 
vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). The concomitant medications included  clopidogrel.  The corrective 
treatment,  outcome,  and  relevant  details  such as  medical  history  was  unknown.  Further information  on 
patient's  age,  weight,  and  body  mass index (BMI),  past  medical history,  thrombosis  risk  factors,  current 
medications and  current  condition  excluding  alternative  aetiologies  for the  reported  event  are needed  to 
fully  assess this  case.  Based  upon  the reported  information,  the role  of the individual suspect vaccine 
cannot  be  assessed.  This  case  was  assessed  as  BCCD  level  4 for thrombosis/thromboembolism. 
- Case •••••• received  from  HCP via -reported  in  a  78-year-old �ith past medical 
history  of immunodeficiency  and  ongoing  hypothyroidism,  atrial fibrillation and  cardiac failure who 
experienced  a DVT and  thrombocytopenia three  days after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Patient  has been complaining  of calf swelling  since vaccination. The  patient 
also  felt  sweaty  and  had  dizziness  with a  fainting  episode.  The lowest  patient's  platelet count after 
vaccination was  reported  as "132" and  no  previous  platelet counts were known.  Anti- platelet  factor  4 
(PF4)  antibodies  identified  was  unknown. The patient was  diagnosed  with DVT. The patient's past medical 
history  of immunodeficiency  and current condition  of could  be a confounding factor.  Further information 
on patient's weight and  BMI,  allergy  history,  thrombosis risk factors,  immunodeficiency  type,  previous 
platelet counts, current  laboratory findings,  and  concomitant medication  excluding alternative  aetiologies 
for the reported  event are  needed  to fully  assess this case.  Based  upon  the  reported  information, the role 
of  the individual suspect vaccine cannot  be assessed.  This case was  assessed  as  BCCD  level 4 for 
thrombosis/thromboembolism. 
•  One fatal case  of CVST ( 
)  is  presented  in  Table 1  of fatal  cases in  Appendix  6.3.  This 
case  involves  78-year-old-who  experienced  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis  two  days  after 
receiving  COVID-19  vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). The  patient  has  previous medical history  of 
COVID-19  approximately  three  months  ago  and  TIA approximately  two  years  ago  and  was  on aspirin.  The 
patient had  ongoing hypertension.  Further  information regarding  previous  COVID-19  vaccinations, 
indication  of reported  concomitant  medications  including  aspirin,  medical  history  and  risk factors, 
examination  results and  context  for the  reported  event are needed  to fully  assess  this 
Based  on  the medical review  of cumulative data,  no safety  concern  has  been  identified. 
In addition,  no increased 0/E ratio  has  been detected  for venous thrombo-embolism. 
For CVST, no significant 0/E ratio increase has been  detected  using  a reporting rate  of  100%.  However,  a 
significant  0/E ratio increase has  been detected  using a  reporting  rate  of  50% (meaning  that  only  50% of 
the  cases  were  reported). This  analysis  presents limitation as it is  based  on  only  one  event  which  makes 
this  analysis unconclusive.  In addition,  this case  has  been  assessed  as  BCCD  level 4 for 
thrombosis/thromboembolism.  This AESI will continue to  be closely  monitored.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
1  case of pulmonary embolism,  1  case of DVT,  3 cases of thrombosis and 1  case of CVST were  reported. 
In  the case  of pulmonary embolism,  DVT and in  most  of the cases reporting  thrombosis  there  is limited 
information precluding  in-depth  assessment.  When  the  cases  contain  only limited information,  the  MAH 
should not simply conclude  that the  causal relationship  cannot be  established but should carefully follow­
up the cases in order to obtain  as much available information  as possible  especially when the AEs  are 
serious  or unlisted.  0/E  analysis  for thrombosis  and pulmonary embolism  is  below  1 .  
In  addition  to  the  cases of pulmonary embolism  and thrombosis,  1  fatal case  of CVST 
was reported during  the  covered period.  In this  case,  CVST occurred 2  days after vaccination  with

In  the medical history,  therapy with  aspirin  and ongoing hypertension  is  described.  The  MAH is requested 
to follow-up  the  case in  order to obtain  as much available  information  as possible.  The case  with  updated 
information should be  discussed in detail in the next PSUR.  The result of 0/E  analysis is below 1,  however 
when  the reporting rate  of 50% is  considered,  a  significant 0/E  ratio  increase is observed.  The PRAC Rapp 
agrees  with  the MAH ' s statement that no conclusion  can be made  based on  the only case  with  limited 
information.  Next PSUR

suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. BCCD level 4 for thrombosis/thromboembolism. 
Based on medical review of cumulative data, no safety concern has been identified nor pattern in 
thrombotic and thrombo-embolic events. In  addition, no increased 0/E ratio has been detected for 
ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
There is  a  discrepancy between the number of stroke cases listed in  the body of PSUR  and in the 
Appendix  6.4.2.  While  6 cases of stroke  without specification  of type are described in  the PSUR  body,  7 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 39/83 
cases  of ischaemic stroke  (1  case reported after OLP) and 6 cases  of haemorrhagic stroke are stated in 
the Appendix.  The MAH is  requested to  clarify  this  discrepancy  within  the  RSI.  In  addition,  the  MAH is 
requested to  discuss  ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke  separately in  next PSURs.  Next  PSUR 
Out of 6 cases  described in  the  PSUR,  1  case  was  reported from  a  healthcare professional and 5 cases 
were  reported from  patients.  In  the medically confirmed case ■••••• a  78-year-old -with 
medical history of TIA,  obesity,  palpitations,  and hypertension  experienced stroke  one day after 
vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta.  Within  the  laboratory results,  thrombocytopaenia  and D-dimer above 
4000  were  listed.  The result of anti-PF4  is not known.  The details  about the  type of stroke  and the  results 
of CT or MR  were  not provided  (BCC level 4 ).  The MAH is requested to follow up  the case in order to 
obtain  information  about the results  of CT/MR  and other relevant examinations and tests.  The MAH is 
asked to  discuss  the new information  about the  case  in  the  respective  section  in  the next PSUR.  Next

No  case  report of Guillain-Barre syndrome has been reported. 
2.3.1.15.  Immune thrombocytopaenia 
No  case  report of immune thrombocytopenia has been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH should continue to  present data  on  GBS and immune thrombocytopaenia in  the  PSUR. 
2.3. 1 . 1 6.  Microangiopathy and thrombotic microangiopathy 
No case report of microangiopathy or thrombotic microangiopathy has  been  reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH proposed the primary risk  window for purposes of O/E  analysis  as  14  days.  However,  the risk 
window of microangiopathy is  established as  28  days  in  the  Protocol  V2.2 for Rapid Safety Assessment of 
SARS-CoV-2  vaccines  in  EU Member States  using  electronic health  care  data  sources  listed in  ENCEPP. 
The MAH is  requested to  revise  the risk  window in  the  next PSUR.  Next PSUR

2.3.1.17.  All Immune-mediated/autoimmune AESis 
Three case reports  of  different immune-mediated/autoimmune AESis were reported: 
) that  is also mentioned in 
•  One serious  case report of myocarditis  ( 
Myocarditis/pericarditis section. 
•  One serious case report of gout c••••••) reported from an  HCP  via-referred to a 91-
year-old-patient with no reported medical history who developed gout flare two days after 
vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). The patient's concomitant medications 
included indapamide for renal hypertension.  The patient's past vaccinations were not reported. The 
outcome was reported as not recovered. Based on the limited information provided regarding this case, 
causal role of the  company suspect product cannot be excluded. 
•  One non-serious case report  of vasculitis  ( 
vasculitis section. 
) that is also mentioned below in Single organ 
Based  on medical  review of the case  reports,  no safety concern nor pattern on immune­
mediated/autoimmune AESis has been identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH provided 3 case reports describing immune-mediated or autoimmune AEs.  The case of 
myocarditis  is  discussed above in the section  2.3. 1 . 2. 
The case of gout is described in  this section,  however available information is insufficient to make any 
conclusion.  Most of described cases in the PSUR  contain  very limited information precluding any 
meaningful assessment.  In  the next PSUR,  the MAH is requested to provide  a description  how case follow­
ups are processed depending  on seriousness  and listedness of the AEs.  Next PSUR 
In  addition,  the MAH is  requested to  follow-up  the case 
the  updated case  in  the respective section  of the  next PSUR.  Next PSUR

The MAH should continue to  present data  on  immune-mediated/autoimmune AESis  in  the PSUR. 
2.3.1. 18.  Specific Immune-mediated/autoimmune AESis: Acute  Disseminated 
Encephalomyelitis,  Transverse myelitis,  Narcolepsy,  Multi-inflammatory Syndrome, Acute 
pancreatitis,  Kawasaki disease, Sub-acute  thyroiditis 
No  case report  of  Acute Disseminated  Encephalomyelitis,  Transverse myelitis,  Narcolepsy,  Multi­
inflammatory  Syndrome,  Acute  pancreatitis,  Kawasaki  disease, Sub-acute thyroiditis has been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The risk  window of acute pancreatitis,  subacute  thyroiditis  and Kawasaki disease are not listed in the 
Appendix  6.4.  of PSUR.  The risk  window of pancreatitis  and Kawasaki disease are established as 28 days 
and the  risk window of thyroiditis  as  1 80 days  in  the  Protocol  V2. 2  for  Rapid  Safety Assessment of SARS­
Co V-2  vaccines in EU Member States  using  electronic health  care data  sources listed,  ENCEPP.  The MAH is 
requested to  include  these risk  window in  the  next PSUR.  Next PSUR 
The MAH determined the primary risk  window of narcolepsy as  1 -42 days and the secondary risk  window 
as  90-183 days.  The gap between primary and secondary risk  window is not clarified.  The MAH states 
PRAC PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 41/83 
that the secondary risk  window was determined based on  the consensus definition  from the AESI  Working 
Group  of Vaccine  Europe,  March  2021  but the  case  definition  of narcolepsy made  within  the ACCESS 
Project does not include  information  on  the  risk  window.  However,  the risk period of 1 -1 80  days  is stated 
in  the protocol V2.2 for Rapid safety assessment of SARS-CoV-2  vaccines in  EU  Member States  using 
electronic health  care data  sources.  The MAH is  requested to correct the secondary risk window of 
narcolepsy according  to  the above-mentioned protocol (V2.2).  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue to  present data  on Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis,  Transverse myelitis, 
Narcolepsy,  Multi-inflammatory Syndrome, Acute pancreatitis,  Kawasaki disease and Sub-acute thyroiditis 
in  the  PSUR. 
2.3.1.19.  Single  organ cutaneous vasculitis 
One  case report of single organ  cutaneous vasculitis has been reported. 
•  One non-serious  case •••••• of vasculitis from an HCP via -involving an 86-year-old 
-with  medical history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia experienced vasculitis  three  days after 
vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Reportedly, the  patient  presented with 
purpuric rash over lower limbs  (but platelet  count was  110) which seemed to be possibly  due to vasculitis 
or immune mediated.  Patient was tested  antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  (ANCA)  positive.  Patient's 
past vaccinations were not  reported.  Information on  corrective treatment not reported  and outcome was 
reported as not  recovered.  Further information regarding patient's medical conditions at the time of 
vaccine,  concurrent  illness  and previous vaccinations and tolerance are needed to fully assess this case. 
Based  upon the reported information, the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed.  The 
case report was assessed as BCCD level 5 for  Single Organ Cutaneous Vasculitis. 
Based on  the medical review of the  case report, no safety concern was identified. In addition, no 
increased  O/E  ratio has been detected for single organ  cutaneous vasculitis. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
describing single  organ  cutaneous vasculitis  during the 
The MAH received one HCP case 
covered period,  however some  important information  was not provided.  The MAH is  therefore requested 
to follow-up  the case in  order to  obtain  the  results  of biopsy,  additional laboratory tests,  information 
about possible  involvement of other organs,  information  about concomitant medications and/or other 
comorbidities.  The MAH is asked to discuss the  updated case in  the respective section  in the next PSUR. 
Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue to  present data  on  organ  cutaneous vasculitis in  the  PSUR. 
2.3. 1.20.  Renal AESI  (including glomerulonephritis 
No  case report  of renal AESis has been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH  determined the primary risk  window of AKI and glomerulonephritis  for purposes of O/E analysis 
as  1 -1 4  days.  The PRAC Rapp  is  of opinion  that the proposed risk  window is  too  short and proposes  to 
extend the primary risk  window to  1 80  days  in  line  with  the protocol  V2.2.  for Rapid safety assessment of

2.3. 1.21.  Eye  disorders  (including optic neuritis) 
A total  of  16  case report of  eye disorders were identified including nine serious cases and seven non­
serious cases  (no fatal outcome was reported). Of these, nine cases (56%) were reported as serious. 
Among  these  cases,  four  had  another  more likely  explication, one  had confounding factors for  eye 
disorders onset  (drug  history including amitriptyline,  which  can cause eye disorders) and four did not 
provide medical and drug history, thus being not assessable for  confounding factors. 
•  Case •••••• was  reported from an HCP via - and referred  to a  93-year-old - with  an 
unspecified  ongoing  food  allergy  experienced back pain,  eye  movement  disorder,  respiratory  arrest,  and 
erythema a couple  of minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted).  This  case is 
presented under the Section on Anaphylactic reactions. 
•  Case •••••• reported from an HCP via - referred to a 90-year-old �ith no reported 
medical history who developed retinal  haemorrhage the  same day after vaccination with  COVID-19 
vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Patient's past vaccinations were not reported.  The outcome was 
reported as not recovered.  Based on  the  limited reported information regarding condition at  the  time of 
vaccination,  concomitant disease or risk factor excluding other predisposing  aaetiologies,  the role of 
suspect cannot be assessed. 
•  Case •••••• received from consumer via- and referred to an 8 1-years-old unknown 
gender patient  experienced subconjunctival  haemorrhage one day after vaccination with  COVID- 19 
vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). At time of reporting,  the outcome was recovering for the  event. 
Based on  the  limited information provided  regarding this case,  causal role of the  company suspect 
product cannot be  excluded. 
•  Case •••••• was  reported  by  a consumer via -and involves  76-year-old

•  Case 
experienced blurry vision,  cold sweat, and sweating attack two days after vaccination with COVID-19 
vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Three days after vaccination, the patient experienced 
lymphadenopathy.  The first attack (blurry vision/loss of focus)  lasted only about  10 secs and was followed 
by a cold sweat lasting five-10 minutes.  Another attack (no vision impairment this time) of  heavy 
sweating accompanied by slight nausea occurred two hours later and lasted for about  10-15 mins. The 
next day, lymph nodes were swollen and tender.  The patient's past vaccination(s)  included SARS-COV-2 
vaccine on 09 April 2022 and Comirnaty on  21 December 2020.  Concomitant medications included 
atorvastatin,  ramipril,  indapamide,  and bisoprolol fumarate for  hypertension.  At time of reporting, the 
outcome was recovered for all the events excepted swollen lymph nodes  (recovering).  Patient's 
hypertension could be confounding factor for event occurrence.  Based on the limited information provided 
regarding this case, causal role of the company suspect product cannot be excluded.

increased, wheezing same day after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  The 
patient's past medical treatment included potassium and antihypertensives. Patient's past vaccinations 
were not reported.  Outcome was reported  as unknown.  Further information regarding patient's medical 
history, allergy history, medical condition at the time of vaccination,  previous vaccinations and tolerance 
are needed to fully assess this case. Based upon the reported information,  the role of the individual 
suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. 
•  Case •••••• reported from a consumer via- referred to a 77-year-old�ith medical 
history of post-polio syndrome  (poliomyelitis)  developed dizziness,  vertigo,  blood pressure decreased, 
and vision blurred within an hour of vaccination with  COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted) 
vaccine.  Concomitant medications included  amitriptyline for  myalgia;  atorvastatin for TIA;  clopidogrel and 
lansoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's past vaccinations were not reported. 
Outcome was reported as not recovered for dizziness and unknown for rest of events. The patient's past 
four concomitant medication could be confounding factors.  Further information on allergy history, 
patient's  clinical  condition  at the time of  vaccination,  previous vaccinations and tolerance  excluding 
alternative  aetiologies for the reported  event are needed to fully assess this case. Based on the reported, 
the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. 
•  Case •••••• reported from consumer via-referred to a 77-year-old- with no 
reported medical history experienced tinnitus,  ocular  hypertension,  parosmia and  cluster  headache one 
day  after  vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Patient's past vaccinations were 
not  reported. At  time  of reporting,  the outcome was recovering for  cluster  headache and not recovered 
rest of the events.  Further information on patient's past medical history,  concomitant medication, 
concurrent conditions excluding alternative aetiologies for the reported event are needed to fully assess 
this case. Based on the limited reported information,  the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be 
assessed. 
• Seven non-serious cases of eye disorders were reported  (44%  of total).  Median age of patients was 
81. 5  years.  Four patients were female,  one was male,  and gender was not reported for two patients 
(Male/Female ratio:  0.25).  Median time to eye disorders onset was 1. 5 days  (min:  one day, max:  four 
days).  For three patients, time to symptom onset was not known.  At time of reporting,  three patients had 
recovered from the event,  two were recovering,  and two had not recovered. In  one case of ocular itching 
there was a major confounding factor  (pollen allergy).  In four cases, medical and drug history was not 
provided. Two cases had a more likely explanation.  In four cases, eye disorders were the only condition 
reported.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A  total  of 13  fatal  cases  were reported during  the covered period  (see below the section  2.3.4.).  The MAH 
assessed 2  of them as sudden death.  Both  cases  include  only scarce information precluding  any 
meaningful assessment.  The cases with  the  fatal outcome are the most serious cases,  which  should be 
carefully monitored and assessed.  Therefore,  the MAH is strongly requested to  make an effort to  obtain 
as  much  information  as possible and to  discuss  the fatal  cases in  view of the new information  including 
the assessment of the  causal relationship  with  VidPrevtyn  in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR

"Angioedema" (Narrow) and retrieved 17 cases including seven serious cases and 10 non-serious cases of 
swelling face/angioedema, none met BCCD level  1 or 2 for anaphylaxis. The serious cases are discussed 
below followed by  a brief overview of the non-serious cases is presented: 
•  Case •••••• was reported from  a HCP via -involving a 79-year-old - with ongoing 
asthma and multiple allergies who  developed  swelling face and rash erythematous one hour  after 
receiving  COVID-19  vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Patient's past medical history included 
anaphylactic reaction with  Haemaccel.  Patient's past vaccinations were not  reported.  The patient took 
cetirizine  orlll own.  The patient was  hospitalized  and recovered on  the same day.  Patient's ongoing 
asthma and multiple allergies with  cats,  dust,  wool  could be confounding factor for the events.  Based 
upon the reported information,  the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be  assessed.  This case 
was assessed as BCCD  level 4 for anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• reported from an  HCP via- involving a 90-year-old-who experienced 
lower lip angioedema two days after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). 
Patient had urticaria rash to inside elbow. At time  of reporting, the outcome was not recovered for the 
event. Insufficient information was provided for assessment. Based on the limited information provided 
regarding this case,  causal role of the company suspect product cannot be excluded.  This case was 
assessed as BCCD level 5 for anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• reported from - An 83-year-old patient of unknown gender experienced red 
neck,  urticaria,  rash  (from neck down to breasts and on  the back),  ache and back pain one day  after 
vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Patient also experienced headache, 
fatigue,  and asthenia six days after vaccination. At time of reporting,  the patient was recovering from all 
the events excepted  tiredness,  feeling of total lack of  energy,  headache,  ache  (not recovered).  Further 
information on allergy history, previous laboratory investigations;  patient's medical history excluding 
alternative  aetiologies for  the reported event are  needed to fully assess this case. Based on  the reported 
information,  the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed.  This case was assessed as 
BCCD  level  5 for anaphylaxis. 
reported from consumer via - A  76-year-old- with past medical 
•  Case 
history of myocardial infarction and hepatic steatosis, experienced allergy,  hives two days after 
vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, adjuvanted). Rash was like hives with large red lumps 
over most of body.  On an unknown date, the patient  developed lip swelling. Concomitant medications 
included generics bisoprolol for coronary heart disease.  At time of  reporting,  the outcome was not 
resolved for the event allergy,  and was unknown for the event lip swelling and hives.  Further information 
on  allergies,  previous laboratory  investigations to exclude  alternative  aetiologies for the  reported  event 
are needed to fully  assess this case.  Based on the reported information,  the role  of the individual suspect 
vaccine cannot be assessed.  This case was  assessed  as BCCD level 5 for  anaphylaxis. 
reported from consumer via 
•  Case 
experienced hives two days after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). 
Concomitant medications included simvastatin for blood cholesterol increased;  and nitrofurantoin and co­
amoxiclav for urinary  tract  infection.  At time  of reporting,  the  outcome  was  not  recovered.  The  patient's 
concomitant medications could be confounding factors.  Further information on allergies, past medical 
history,  patient's age,  and gender to exclude  alternative aetiologies for  the  reported event are needed to

fully assess this case.  Based on the  reported,  the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be 
assessed.  This case was  assessed as BCCD level 5 for anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• was reported from a consumer via- A 78-year-old-experienced severe 
cutaneous AR,  pruritus,  urticaria  and rash five  days after  vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant,  adjuvanted).  Concomitant  medications  included amlodipine, atenolol, and losartan for 
hypertension;  warfarin for  atrial  fibrillation;  lansoprazole for Barrett's oesophagus.  Five days after the 
COVID booster injection, the  patient experienced  pruritus of entire upper arm which intensified rapidly 
over the next week to severe urticaria affecting both arms, backs of hands, left thigh, both feet and backs 
of upper left arm.  Patient sought advice from local  pharmacist on second day and obtained an 
antihistamine  (Chlorpheniramine) which the patient has taken six times daily since then.  Rash and itching 
persisted even after nine days. At time of reporting,  the outcome was not recovered / not resolved.  The 
patient's past three  previous COVID vaccines and  past medical history included immune 
thrombocytopenia.  Further information on  allergies,  current condition  precluding alternative aetiologies 
for the reported event are needed to fully assess this case.  Based on the reported information, the  role of 
the individual suspect  vaccine  cannot be assessed. This case was assessed as BCCD level 5 for 
anaphylaxis. 
•  Case •••••• reported from a consumer via -and referred to  an unknown age ■•1:>atient 
who developed  pruritus,  pharyngeal  swelling,  vaccination  site bruising, vaccination site warmth and 
lymphadenopathy unknown duration after the vaccination.  This  case is  already  presented under Section 
15. 1. 1.1 Anaphylactic  reactions. 
In addition,  10 non-serious cases  (59%  of total) were retrieved  reporting  facial swelling and angioedema 
during the  period of this report.  The median age of  patients was 80 years  (seven elderly/three adults). 
There were six males and four females reported in these cases  (Male/Female ratio:  1.50).  Median time to 
onset  (TTO)  of events was two days  (min :  the same  day,  max:  four days).  For four  patients,  time  to 
symptom onset was not known. At  time  of reporting, the  outcome was reported as not recovered/not 
resolved in five  patients,  recovering/resolving in three  patients, recovered/resolved in  one  patient and 
unknown in remaining one case.  In two cases there were confounding factors  (such as co-suspect 
medications/ thyroid disorder) whereas remaining eight cases had insufficient information regarding  the 
relevant  case details such as onset latency,  medical history, concomitant medications for a 
comprehensive evaluation. All these cases were assessed as BCCD level 5 for anaphylaxis. 
Based medical review of cumulative data, a signal on Allergic including anaphylactic reactions has been 
opened on  17 May 2023 and has been validated on  14 June 2023. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
During  the covered period,  1 7  cases  of angioedema  were  reported.  It is not clear why the MAH assessed 
the  cases of angioedema  according  to  the  case  definition  for anaphylaxis.  Angioedema is only one 
symptom  of anaphylaxis  and it cannot be  expected that the cases  of angioedema  will automatically fulfil 
the  criteria  for anaphylaxis.  2  serious  cases  were  reported by healthcare professionals,  4  serious  cases 
were  reported by patients  and  1  case  was  received from  the MHRA.  Angioedema is described in  4 serious 
cases,  3 serious  cases describe  urticaria  without face swelling. 
In August 2023 the  MAH submitted a  variation  of the marketing  authorisation  related to  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  where  angioedema  is  also  covered.

confounding factors for dizziness onset (drug history including anti-hypertensive, methotrexate, or 
endocrine treatment, which can cause dizziness;  medical history including post-polio syndrome) and six

these cases reported a fatal outcome. Of the serious cases, two cases (■■■■■• ■■■■■•) 
are already presented under Eye disorders (See Section  15.1.1.22 of the PBRER) and one case 
(■••••■) is presented under Anaphylactic reactions (See Section  15.1.1.1 of the PBRER)  The 
remaining  13  serious cases are discussed below with a brief overview of the non-serious cases: 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In the case 
a patient with a  medical history of potassium  and antihypertensives  and  with 
no  medical history of dizziness  experienced dizziness and visual impairment,  nausea,  malaise,  heart rate 
increased,  wheezing  on  the  day  of vaccination.  The outcome is  not known. Although  antihypertensives 
are  described in  the  medical history,  the patient did not  experience dizziness  until  vaccination  and 
considering  other possible symptoms  of reactogenicity,  the PRAC Rapp  concludes  this  case  as probably 
related to  VidPrevtyn  Beta. 
In  the  case 
a patient experienced dizziness,  vertigo,  hypotension  and  blurred  vision 
within  one  hour after the  vaccination.  Vagal/anxiety-related reaction,  which  is  already listed in  section  4. 4 
of the  SmPC,  cannot be excluded in  this  case.

who experienced dizziness on the same day patient 
• Case 
received COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). On the following day, the patient experienced 
shaking, flu-like symptoms, unsteadiness, syncope, and weakness. The patient recovered on the next 
day. Based on the limited information provided regarding this case, causal role of the company suspect 
product cannot be assessed. Further information regarding concurrent condition during vaccination, 
previous vaccination, concomitant medication and tolerance, allergic history, laboratory investigations 
excluding alternative aetiologies for the reported event are needed to fully assess this case. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In this  case  a patient experienced dizziness  on the day of vaccination,  shaking,  flu-like  symptoms, 
unsteadiness,  syncope  and  weakness  occurred  the  next day and the  patient recovered two  days after 
vaccination.  With  respect to close time relationship,  other possible  symptoms of reactogenicity and 
transient character of the  reactions,  the PRAC Rapp concludes the causal relationship probably related  to 
VidPrevtyn  Beta.

factor. Based on the limited information  provided regarding this case, causal role of the company suspect 
product cannot  be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A patient experienced dyspnoea,  light headedness,  unsteady gait and hoarse voice on  the day of 
vaccination.  Hypersensitive reaction  cannot be excluded without additional information  on course, 
outcome and treatment of the reactions. 
•  Case •••••• involving an 86-year-old- who experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, 
painful arm, dizziness, and diarrhoea one day after receiving COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted).  Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate, which could be a 
confounding factor.  Based on the  limited information  provided regarding this case, causal role of the 
company suspect product cannot be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In this  case,  a patient experienced dizziness, abdominal pain,  vomiting,  diarrhoea and painful arm one 
day after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta.  Rheumatoid arthritis and use of methotrexate are described in 
the medical history.  The Rapp does not agree  with  the  MAH ' s conclusion,  that the case is  confounded by 
the chronic condition  and long-term  medication.  The use of concomitant medication  cannot be 
automatically interpreted as a confounding factor.  If a patient with  long-term  medication  did not suffer 
with  dizziness in  the past and  the reaction  occurred shortly after vaccination,  the  influence  of long-term 
medication  is  not very  likely.  With  respect to  close time relationship and other possible symptoms of 
reactogenicity the Rapp  concludes this case as probably related to VidPrevtyn  Beta.

fluttering, light-headedness, shortness of breath, wheezing, headache, injection site pain  and tiredness 
on the same day the  patient received COVID- 19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). Additional 
information  regarding  condition  at the time of vaccination, concomitant disease or risk factor excluding 
other predisposing aetiologies would be needed for complete assessment of the case. Based on the 
reported  information, the role of the company suspect product cannot be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A patient experienced dizziness together with  heart fluttering,  shortness of breath,  wheezing,  headache, 
tiredness and injection site pain  on the day of vaccination.  Without additional information  on  the  course 
and treatment it is not possible to conclude  whether dizziness  together with  dyspnoea and wheezing are 
not the symptoms of hypersensitivity.

fainting, low blood pressure, headache,  nausea and felt  generally ill on the same day the patient received 
COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted).  The patient was hospitalized for these events.  Medical 
history  included myocardial infarction. Treatment history  included eplerenone, lisinopril and citalopram, 
which could be confounding factors. Based on the limited information  provided regarding this case,  causal 
role of the  company  suspect product cannot be assessed.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The  case 
contains  only limited information,  no information  about examinations,  laboratory

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In  this  case,  a patient experienced dizziness  together with  vomiting,  disorientation,  cold sweats,  stomach 
tenderness,  nausea,  fever and pain  in  arm  on  the  day of vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta.  The MAH 
concluded that the case is confounded by the  medications  described in  the  medical history.  As already 
discussed above,  the  MAH should  carefully consider the possible  influence  of long-term  medication  on  a 
new adverse  event not described in  the past,  which  occurred shortly after vaccination  together with  other 
symptoms.  Considering  the close time relationship and other possible symptoms  of reactogenicity  the

history  included  bimatoprost and  timolol eye drops,  as  well  as  amlodipine  and  Bendroflumethiazide. All 
these medications  could  be  confounding factors  for  the safety topic of interest.  Further information on 
allergy  history,  past medical  history  excluding alternative  aetiologies for  the reported  event  are  needed to 
fully  assess  this case.  Based  upon  the report,  the  role  of the  individual  suspect  vaccine  cannot  be

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
This  case concerns a patient who experienced dizziness,  unsteadiness and memory Joss two  days after 
vaccination  and  was hospitalized.  No  information  about the performed examinations,  laboratory results, 
diagnosis  or  treatment was provided.  The MAH is  requested to  carefully follow-up  the serious case

•  Case •••••• involving a 78-year-old- who experienced dizziness and sickness two  days 
after receiving COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). According to reporter, these events were 
leading to a disability.  Medical history includes thyroid  cancer treated by thyroxin, which could be a 
confounding factor.  Based on the limited information provided regarding this case,  causal role of the 
company suspect product cannot be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
A patient experienced dizziness and sickness two  days after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn Beta.  The MAH 
concluded that the  use of thyroxin  for treatment of thyroid cancer was a confounding factor.  Thyroxin  is 
used as  suppressive  therapy of thyroid cancer and changed to  the substitution  therapy when remission  is 
achieved.  It is not clear if the suppressive  therapy is  ongoing at the  time  of vaccination.  The Rapp 
concludes this case as possible related with limited information. 
•  Case •••••• involving a 78-year-old -who experienced dizziness, shortness of breath, and 
tiredness one day after receiving COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted). On the next day,  the

reporter,  these  events  were  leading to a disability.  Further  information  on  allergy  history,  patient's 
medical history,  family history, past medication,  laboratory investigation,  previous laboratory 
investigations excluding alternative  aetiologies for the reported event are needed to fully assess this case. 
Based upon the reported information, the role of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In this  case a patient experienced dizziness  with  dyspnoea and tiredness one day after vaccination. 
Considering  the close  time relationship and other possible symptoms of reactogenicity,  the Rapp 
concludes this case as probably related to  VidPrevtyn  Beta.

•  Case 
who experienced unspecified arthralgia and arm 
pain on the same day patient received COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted).  On the following 
day, patient  developed  a serious  dizziness.  On an unknown date,  nausea,  fatigue,  and pyrexia appeared. 
Medical history included arthritis, which is a major confounding factor for reported arthralgia. Treatment 
history includes amlodipine, which could be a confounding factor for reported dizziness. At the time of 
reporting  (four days after vaccine injection),  patient was  recovering  from nausea,  fatigue, and arm pain, 
and had already  recovered  (unknown date) from dizziness,  pyrexia and  arthralgia.  Additional information 
regarding  condition at the time of vaccination,  concomitant disease or risk factor excluding  other 
predisposing  aetiologies would be needed for complete  assessment  of the case.  Based upon the reported 
information, the role of suspect cannot be assessed. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In this  case a patient experienced arthralgia  and arm  pain  on  the day of vaccination,  dizziness  occurred 
the  next day.  In  addition,  the patient experienced nausea,  fatigue and pyrexia.  Considering  the close  time 
relationship  and other possible symptoms of reactogenicity,  the Rapp concludes  this  case as probably 
related to  VidPrevtyn  Beta. 
•  In addition, 24 non-serious cases of dizziness were reported (60% of total).  Median age of patients was 
78  years,  of which  15 patients were female, four were male and gender was not reported for  five patients 
(Male/Female ratio:  0.27).  Median time to dizziness onset was the same day  (max:  three days).  For three

patients,  time to symptom onset was  not known. At time of reporting, seven  patients had recovered from 
the event,  seven  were recovering, six had  not recovered and for four patients the outcome was unknown. 
When reported, time to recovery ranged between the same day and one day after dizziness onset. In 
eight cases, there were confounding factors (such as anti-hypertensive or endocrine treatment which can 
induce dizziness). In  10 cases, medical and drug history was not provided. Two cases had another more 
likely explanation (vasovagal syndrome and its aftereffects). Four cases were free from confounding 
factors. In eight cases, dizziness was the only symptom reported. 
Based on the medical review of reported case reports of dizziness,  no pattern or safety concern  has been 
identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
24 non-serious cases of dizziness were reported.  Time to onset was O  - 3 days  which is consistent with 
TTO  of dizziness described in  the  serious cases and with  TTO  of reactogenicity symptoms generally. 
Rapporteur assessment conclusion: 
40 cases concerning dizziness were reported during the covered period and also cumulatively.  The MAH 
provided the individual review of each serious case only,  but dizziness is usually non-serious,  subjective, 
temporary,  self-limited,  short-term  reaction  and  most cases  being reported as non-serious  can  be 
expected.  In  next reviews,  the MAH should take  into account the character of the reactions and the non­
serious cases should be described in  detail when appropriate.  Next PSUR 
The MAH concluded that many cases reporting dizziness contain  limited information  for conclusion  on  the 
causal relationship,  but it is not fully clear why the results of various examinations and tests,  family, 
vaccination  and allergic history should be  necessary for  the  assessment of the short-term,  self-limited 
reaction  which is  usually subjective  and mostly non-serious.  Medical practice for the specific  conditions 
should be considered during  the assessment. 
The MAH applied a hyper-conservative approach in the assessment,  the cases with  concomitant 
medication are assessed as confounded irrespective of the possible influence of the concomitant 
medication  on  the  occurrence of dizziness.  This approach is  not acceptable.  The use of concomitant 
medication  cannot be automatically interpreted as a  confounding factor. If a patient with  long-term 
medication  did not experience dizziness in  the past and the  reaction  occurs shortly after the  vaccination, 
the influence of long-term  medication is not very likely. 
In  all  described cases,  dizziness occurred in  the first days  after  vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta.  In  one 
case reporting  dizziness,  a  vagal/anxiety-related reaction  occurred.  In several cases,  hypersensitivity 
reaction  cannot be  excluded.  The  Rapp  concluded 9 serious cases as probably related to  VidPrevtyn  Beta 
especially based on  the close time relationship and simultaneous occurrence of other possible symptoms 
of reactogenicity. 
The PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship  between  VidPrevtyn  Beta and dizziness is 
at least a reasonable possibility.  Dizziness should be added  to  the product information.  The 
MAH is  requested to propose a frequency of this  new adverse reaction  based on the available 
data.

PSUR.  Next PSUR 
2.3.3.B.  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura/autoimmune thrombocytopenia 
No case report of Immune thrombocytopenic purpura/autoimmune thrombocytopenia has  been reported. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The terms immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune thrombocytopaenia fall under the term 
immune thrombocytopaenia and should be  discussed in  the section  of immune thrombocytopaenia in  the 
next PSUR.  Next PSUR. 
The MAH determined the primary risk  window of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  as  1-14 days and 
the secondary risk window as 1 -28 days.  The  windows proposed by the MAH seems to  be too short for 
immune mediated reactions.  The PRAC Rapp proposes to  harmonise the risk  window with  the risk  window 
determined for immune thrombocytopaenia.  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue to  present data  on  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and immune 
thrombocytopenia in the PSUR. 
2.3.3.9.  Post orthostatic  tachycardia syndrome 
No case of Post  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome has been reported. 
2.3.3. 1 0.  Seizures  (including general convulsions and all other seizure presentations) 
Based on  the  MedDRA search strategy, total of  five cases reported seizures.  All  these cases were reported 
as serious with no fatal outcome being reported.  Four of these cases were reported in the elderly 
population and the age group was unknown in remaining case. All these cases were assessed as per the 
BCCD for seizures as presented below: 
•  Case •••••• reported from an  HCP via - and referred to an 89-year-old - with no 
history of seizures who experienced seizures two days after receiving COVID-19 vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) vaccine and was hospitalized.  Patient also experienced loss of consciousness of unknown 
duration  after  the vaccination.  Patient's  head CT was reported as normal.  Patient had  ongoing  unspecified 
and past vaccination included two COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BioNTech.  The concomitant 
medications included carbomer for dry eye.  The patient was treated with levetiracetam for generalized 
PRAC PSUR assessment report

tonic-clonic  seizure. The  outcome  was  reported  as  not  recovered  for seizures  and  u nknown  for loss  of 
consciousness. The patient's  concurrent condition  of dementia might be an  expression  of a  common 
u nderlying confusion  factor.  Fu rther information  regarding patient's  tolerance of previous vaccinations 
and  other laboratory  investigations excluding alternative aetiologies for  the reported event are  needed  to 
fully assess this case.  Based  on  the reported  information, the role of the individual suspect  vaccine cannot 
be assessed. This case was assessed  as  BCCD  level 2 for generalized  convulsions. 
•  Case •••••• reported  from  HCP via - and involving a  7 1 -year-oldllllwith  ongoing 
immunodeficiency  and  Parkinson's disease who experienced  respiratory  arrest  and  seizures 10 min utes 
after  vaccination  with  COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted). Adrenaline was  administered  for 
query  of anaphylaxis,  patient was intubated  and transferred  to  emergency  and was  discharged  after 48 
hours.  Lorazepam and levetiracetam were  given  as corrective  treatment  for seizure.  Patient's  past 
vaccination(s)  included COVID-19 Vaccine from  AstraZeneca,  Comirnaty and from Moderna.  Fu rther 
information  on allergy  history  and  previous  laboratory  investigations excluding alternative aetiologies for 
the reported  event are  needed  to fully  assess  this case.  Based  upon the  reported  information,  the role  of 
the  individ ual suspect  vaccine  cannot be assessed. This  case was  assessed  as  BCCD  Level 4  for 
generalized  convulsions. 
•  Case •••••• reported from an HCP via- and  involving a  patient of u nknown  age and 
gender who experienced  seizure the day of vaccination with COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted).  Fu rther episode of hands twitching,  and deterioration  of consciousness were reported  later. 
No history  of chest  pain,  shortness  of breath was reported .  The patient was  started  on levetiracetam 250 
mg  and  recovered.  Fu rther information  on past medical history, concomitant medication  excluding 
alternative  aetiologies for the reported  event are needed  to fully  assess  this case.  Based  upon the 
reported,  the role  of the individual suspect  vaccine cannot be assessed. This case was assessed  as  BCCD 
level 4 for  generalized  convulsions. 
•  Case •••••• reported  from consumer via- and  involving  an 81-year-old-who 
experienced  unconscious and  fits (non-epileptic) the day  of vaccination  with COVID-19  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted).  It was not reported  if the patient received  a corrective treatment. The 
outcome was reported  as  recovered.  Further information  on allergy  history,  past medical  history, 
concomitant medication,  current condition  excluding alternative  aetiologies for the  reported  event are 
needed  to  fully  assess this case.  Based  upon  the reported  information,  the role  of the  i ndividual suspect 
vaccine cannot be  assessed.  This  case was assessed  as  BCCD  level 4 for generalized  convulsions. 
•  Case •••••• reported from consumer  vi.-and  i nvolving a  79-year-old llllwith  no 
medical history who experienced  seizure one day after  vaccination with COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) and who was admitted  to  hospital for five days. Reportedly, patient lost consciousness 
completely,  was unresponsive for around 10 mins, came rou nd  but  took two-three hrs. All tests were 
clear for stroke/TIA/heart attack,  bloods.  Other laboratory  investigations included  blood  test, CT,  and 
ECG; results were  not reported. At the time of reporting,  the  outcome was recovering for the event. The 
patient had  no  medical history.  Based  on  the limited  information  provided  regarding this case,  causal  role 
of the company suspect  product cannot be excluded. This case  was  assessed  as  BCCD  level 4  for 
generalized  convulsions. 
Based  on medical review of the case reports,  no safety  concern  has  been  identified.  In addition,  no 
increased  O/E  ratio has  been  detected for seizures. 
I Rapporteur assessment comment: 
PRAC PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 57/83 
5 cases of general convulsions were  reported  during  the covered period.  3 cases were  reported by 
healthcare professionals,  2 cases were  reported by consumers.  All cases contain  limited information  about 
results  of ECG,  the result of CT is described only in  1  case.  Not all cases describe  whether loss of 
consciousness occurred.  The MAH is requested to follow-up the cases in  order to get as much  information 
as possible  for a  meaningful assessment. 
The MAH is requested to further monitor general convulsions/seizures in  the subsequent PSUR  where  the 
new information  received during the  follow-ups should be also described.  Next PSUR 
2.3.4. 
Fatal cases 
A total of thirteen case reports with fatal outcome have been received during the period  (including two 
cases that reported  sudden  death). 
All  cases are reported in elderly patients, some of them reported medical history that could give 
alternative  explanation for the fatal outcome.  Fatal outcome is mostly reported shortly after the 
vaccination, same day to one  day in  six case  reports,  two to six days in four  case reports,  10-20 days in 
two patients and it was unknown in remaining one case.  All  case reports provided insufficient information 
on  the patients' medical history, concurrent conditions, previous laboratory investigations,  and  no 
autopsy results excluding alternative aetiologies for the reported event to fully assess the cases.  No  new 
safety concern was identified from the medical review of fatal cases.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
13 fatal cases  were reported during  the covered period and also cumulatively.  All cases contain  very 
limited information  without including results  of the laboratory tests,  other examinations  or the results of 
autopsy precluding any assessment. 
One fatal case 
concerns a 28-year-old-male  with  dementia  who  experienced vomiting 
and aspiration pneumonia.  The MAH stated that further information  is awaited.  The MAH is  requested to 
discuss  the case  in  view of the new information  in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR 
Another fatal case concerns a  78-year-old-female  who  experienced cerebral sinus  venous thrombosis 2 
days after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn Beta.  The case was already discussed above in  the section 
2.3. 1 . 12.  Thromboembolic AESI  and follow-up  was requested. 
Fatal cases are the most serious cases,  which should be carefully monitored and assessed.  However, 
based on  limited information,  an  in-depth assessment of the missing details  is  not possible.  Therefore, 
the MAH is  strongly requested to  make  an  effort to  obtain as much information as possible and to  discuss 
the  cases in  view of the new information including  the assessment of the causal relationship  with 
VidPrevtyn Beta in  the  next PSUR.  In  addition,  the  MAH is  requested to  provide a description  how case 
follow-ups are processed depending on seriousness and listedness of the AEs.  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue to present data  on  fatal cases in  the PSUR.

2.3.5.  Vaccination failure 
Based  on  the  Med DRA search  criteria  as  outli ned  in  Appendix 6.4.1, a  total  eight  case  reports of COVID -
19 infection  were  reported, o f  wh ich two  were  reported a s  serious case  reports a n d  a re  detailed  below 
<•••••• and ••••••)- No fata l  outcomes or severe cases were  being  reported . 
•  One serious case •••••• reported  from  a  consumer via- and i nvolvi ng  a  77 -year-old 
- with  medical  history of atrial fibrillation,  hypertension,  and  hypercholesterolemia, who 
experienced  SARS-coronavirus-1 (CoV- 1)  i nfection  (SARS) 14 days after vaccination with  COVID-19 
vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted) and SARS-CoV-2  i nfection  (COVID-19 :  confirmed  by test)  15  days 
after vaccination .   Based  upon  the reported information, the  role of the i nd ivid ual suspect vaccine  can not 
be assessed .  Th is case was assessed  as serious with  the  criteria  of Medically sign ificant,  but  the  i ntensity 
of severity was  not  reported .  Th is case  was  assessed  as  BCCD  level  5  for VAED and  is detai led  under 
Section  1 5 . 1 . 1 . 8  as Respi ratory AESI. 
•  One serious case •••••• received  from  consumer via - and involving an 86-year-old 
patient (unknown  gender) with  a  medical  history  included atrial fibril lation with  pacemaker fitted  for 
heart, experienced COVID- 19, coughing, fl u, flu  l i ke symptoms and  m ucus discharge  six  days  after 
vaccination with  COVI D-19 vaccine (recombina nt,  adjuva nted). At the time of reporting, the  outcome  was 
recovering for all the  events.  Based  on  the  lim ited  information  provided  regarding this case,  causal  role of 
the  company suspect  product can not  be excluded .  This case  was assessed  as  serious with  the  criteria  of 
med ically sign ificant with  disa bility,  but  the  intensity of severity was  not  reported  for the  events. Th is 
case was assessed  as BCCD level 5 VAED. 
•  Remain ing six non-serious cases  ( 
) were all consumer-reported and were assessed  as  BCCD  level  5  for 
VAED. The TIO  ranged from few  hours after the vacci nation to  few  days  in  most  cases  except for two 
cases  which  reported  respectively a TIO  of fou r  weeks  (■•••••) and of more  than th ree  months 
(■•••••)- The available information  i n  all these cases was  i nsufficient for a  conclusive  eva l uation 
and  the role of individual suspect vaccine cou ld not be ascerta i ned . 
Based  on  medical  review  of cumu lative data,  no safety concern was  identified . 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
8 case  of SARS-CoV-2  infection  were  reported during  the reporting period.  All cases  were  reported from 
patients  and contain  limited information.  2  cases  are serious and  6 cases  are non-serious.  Based on  the 
limited information provided in  the serious  cases,  VAED/VAERD  cannot be  identified. 
In case 
a  77-year-old 
patient with atrial fibrillation,  hypertension,  and 
hypercholesterolemia  experienced SARS-CoV-2  infection  14  days  after vaccination  with  VidPrevtyn  Beta. 
The infection  was confirmed by test.  The MAH stated that the role  of the  vaccine cannot be assessed 
based on  the  available  information.  The Rapp  does  not agree  with this conclusion.  Although  some 
information  is missing,  e.g.,  information  about previous  vaccination,  the  available  data  is sufficient to 
assess  the  causal relationship.  Similarly,  the causal relationship is  concluded as  non-assessable  in  all non­
serious  cases.  The MAH is  requested to  provide  a  detailed description  how the  causal assessment 
between  VidPrevtyn  Beta  and vaccination  failure is performed in  the next PSUR.  Next PSUR 
The MAH should continue  to  present data  on  vaccination  failure  in  the  PSUR.

2.4.  Characterisation of risks 
2.4.1.  New information on  important  identified  risks 
There are no important  identified risks  for COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). Therefore,  this 
section  is not applicable. 
2.4.2.  New information on important potential risks 
The MAH has determined that there was no new relevant safety information that would have an  impact 
on the understanding and characterization of the previously recognized potential risks. However, details 
regarding the new relevant safety information are included below. 
Myocarditis/Pericarditis 
Source  of new  information:  Cases retrieved from the reference interval from GPV Safety database 
• Background relevant to the evaluation:  For more  details on this risk, see also Section  16.4. 
•  Method(s)  of evaluation including data sources,  search criteria,  and analytical approaches:  The  GPV 
Safety database was  searched for the following MedDRA PTs:  "Autoimmune myocarditis", "Eosinophilic 
myocarditis", "Giant cell myocarditis", "Hypersensitivity myocarditis",  "Immune-mediated myocarditis", 
"Lupus myocarditis", "Myocarditis, "Myocarditis post  infection", "Radiation myocarditis".  In addition,  0/E 
analyses are conducted based on the methodology and recommendations described by Mahaux et al. 
•  Results:  From the review of the GPV safety  database,  one case of myocarditis was retrieved for COVID-
19 vaccine  (recombinant,  adjuvanted)  during the reference period.  In addition, no  increased 0/E ratio  has 
been detected for myocarditis/pericarditis  (Refer to Appendix 6.4.2  and Section 16.4). 
• Discussion:  One serious  case report of myocarditis was  reported from consumer  via-in  an elderly 
patient of unknown gender two days after  vaccination.  An  81-year-old and unknown gender patient 
experienced positional  dizziness  and myocarditis two days after vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant,  adjuvanted).  At time of  reporting, the outcome was not recovered.  Further  information on 
patient underlying disease condition,  past medical and drug history, concomitant medications,  description 
of the reported symptoms, complementary investigations and results excluding alternative aetiologies for 
the reported event are needed to fully assess  this  case.  Based upon the reported information,  the role of 
the  individual suspect vaccine cannot be  assessed.  This  case was assessed as BCCD level 4 for 
myocarditis. 
•  Conclusion:  Based on  medical  review  of  cumulative  data supported by 0/E  analysis,  no safety concern 
has been identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Please,  see the assessment of the single  case report of myocarditis in the section  2.3. 1 . 2.  of the AR. 
Vaccines-Associated Enhanced Disease including Vaccine-Associated Enhanced  Respiratory Disease 
There were no cases that reported VAED/VAERD (Refer to  Section  15.1. 5 for Vaccination  Failure and 
Section 15.1.1.3 for  COVID-19 AESis).

2.4.3.  New information on other identified  risks not categorized as important 
There are no identified risks not categorized as important for COVID- 19 vaccine  (recombinant, 
adjuvanted),  therefore this section is not applicable. 
2.4.4.  New information on other potential risks not categorized as important 
Utilizing the surveillance activities,  the MAH has not  identified any new safety  information during the 
reporting interval that would have an impact on the understanding and characterization of the previously 
recognized  potential risk(s) not categorized as important. 
2.4.S.  Update on missing information 
Utilizing the surveillance activities,  the MAH has not identified any new safety information during the 
reporting interval that would have an impact on the understanding and characterization of missing 
information.

No case  reports of use  in pregnancy were reported. 
Two systematic review and meta-analysis were published in  relation to pregnancy. One concerning 
pregnancy outcome following COVID- 19 vaccination with BNT162b2,  Moderna,  ChAdOxl  and Janssen 
vaccines  (8)  and the second in relation to pregnancy outcome and risk of pregnancy related complications 
in COVID- 19 vaccinated pregnant population that found no increased risks in pregnant women or 
neonates of  vaccinated women compared to non-vaccinated, and no significant effects on maternal-foetal 
complication. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The systematic reviews are discussed in section  1 . 3. 5. 5.  Literature  of the AR. 
Use in immunocompromised subjects 
One literature article presented the use of a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine  (SpikoGen)  in patients 
undergoing kidney transplant receiving immunosuppressive therapy.  The observed safety profile in this 
patient population was similar to the previously known safety profile of the vaccine and no SAEs reported. 
Use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities {e.g .• Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease. diabetes. chronic neurological disease. cardiovascular disorders) 
No significant information about the use  with  unstable health conditions and co-morbidities was identified. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The article is discussed in section  1 . 3. 5. 5.  Literature  of the AR. 
Use  in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders 
No significant  information about the use with  autoimmune or  inflammatory disorders was identified.

Interactions with other vaccines 
No  i nformation  about the use with other vaccines was identified. 
Long-term safety 
No  new  information  is available from  post-marketing sources since the vaccine has  been  only 
approximately five months on the market. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The safety concerns remain  unchanged. 
3.  Benefit evaluation 
COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted)  is approved as a booster dose for active immunization to 
prevent COVID- 19  caused by  SARS-CoV-2 in adults who have  previously  received a messenger 
ribonucleic acid  (mRNA) or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine.  The mechanism of action consists of the 
induction of immune responses  against the antigens contained  in  the vaccine. The S glycoprotein  of 
SARS-CoV-2 associated with AS03 adjuvant stimulates  neutralizing and  other functional 5-specific 
antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to 
protection against COVID-19  (47). 
Epidemiology: 
Epidemiological data collected since the beginning of the pandemic have shown that i ndividuals of any 
age  can acquire infection of SARS-CoV-2,  however, there is an uneven distribution of infections per 
defined age  group.  According to data  published  by  the  WHO,  people  aged  30 to 39  years  have the highest 
amount  of  confirmed  and  probable  cases,  followed by 20 to 29,  40 to 49  and  50 to 59 years age groups 
respectively. This age-based distribution, however,  does  not correlate across gender-based distribution, 
with  infections occurring at similar rates between males and females. 
Globally,  till 09  May 2023, there have been  766 029  927 confirmed cases of COVID-19,  including 6  928 
795 deaths, reported to WHO. Although all  regions  have reported substantive numbers of  cases, the 
greatest  cumulative  numbers of  confirmed cases to date have been in  Europe (>276 million cases), the 
Western Pacific (>203  million  cases) and the Americas  (> 178 million  cases). 
Key  risk factors for severe  COVID-19 disease  include but  not limited to  CVD,  diabetes,  chronic respiratory 
disease,  COPD, hypertension, malignancies,  obesity,  chronic kidney  disease,  cerebrovascular disease and 
stroke, with higher risk of severity and mortality ranging 1. 14 to 7 .1 times higher  i n  these risk groups. 
Older age (particularly  �65 years)  is a recognized risk factor for more severe  COVID-19  disease and 
death, with populations aged 65 to 74 years at five times higher risk of hospitalization and 90 times 
higher risk of death than population aged  18  to 29 years old in  the US. 
New  and emerging variants are playing an important role  in  local and global epidemiology. 
Omicron  has established itself as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage globally.  In early 2022,  a large 
number of Omicron-descendent sub-lineages emerged  (BA. 1,  BA.2,  BA.3,  BA.4, BA.5),  with  ECDC 
categorizing these sub-li neages separately to better distinguish their relative  impacts to the 
epidemiological situation. Amongst these sub-lineages,  BA.2,  BA.4 and BA. 5  consistently  circulated  in  the 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 65/83 
EU/EEA until late 2022. The current  epidemiological situation  is  hallmarked  by  a  highly  diverse landscape 
of co-circulating  BA.2  and  BA.5  descendent variants,  which have different properties  to their parental 
lineages and  require  individual assessment. 
Efficacy  data/Immunogenicity  data: 
Efficacy  of CoV2  pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351  strain) vaccine  has  been  inferred  by  immune-bridging  of 
immune  responses  to an authorized  COVID-19  vaccine,  for which VE  has  been  established. The clinical 
immunogenicity  of CoV2  pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351  strain)  vaccine given as a  booster  injection  is  being 
evaluated  in  two  clinical studies:  VAT00013  (Study  1) in COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine-primed  participants 
and VAT00002  Cohort 2,  Beta  arm  (Study  2)  that  included  participants  primed  with  various  types of 
COVID-19  vaccines. 
Immunogenicity results  from  Study  VAT00013 
This  is a  randomized,  single-blinded multicenter investigator-initiated clinical  study  conducted  in  France, 
which evaluated the immune response induced  by  a  booster dose  of  either CoV2  pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351 
strain) vaccine,  or  Pfizer  COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine or Sanofi  investigational booster vaccine  (protein­
based adjuvanted COVID-19  vaccine, D614, 5  µg)  in individuals previously vaccinated with  two  doses of 
Pfizer COVID-19  mRNA vaccine. The  per-protocol analysis population included 217  participants 18  years 
of age and older primed with two  doses  of COVID-19  mRNA vaccine three  to seven months prior to 
receiving  CoV2  pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351  strain) vaccine  (N  =  67),  COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine ( N  =  76)  and 
Sanofi investigational  booster D614  vaccine  (N  =  74).  The mean  age was  40.6  years (range 18  to  73 
years). The mean duration between the second dose  of the  primary  series and the booster dose  was  174 
days and was comparable across groups. 
Among this  per-protocol  population,  samples from  prior to vaccination and 28  days after  booster of 114 
participants  (54  from  CoV2  pres  dTM-AS03  [B.1.351  strain]  vaccine  and  60  from  Pfizer COVID-19  mRNA 
vaccine and 48 from Sanofi investigational  booster D614 vaccine) were tested  by  Pseudovirus 
Neutralization  Assay. The  Geometric  Mean Titers (GMT)  of neutralizing  antibodies  28  days after CoV2 
pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351  strain) vaccine  or  Pfizer COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine booster in  COVID-19  mRNA 
vaccine-primed  participants were compared. 
Superiority  of  GMT  against  Omicron  BA.1  was  demonstrated for CoV2  pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351  strain) 
vaccine group  in  comparison with  Pfizer COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine  group.  Non-inferiority  of  seroresponse 
rate against Omicron  BA.1 and D614G strains for CoV2 pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351  strain) vaccine 
compared  to  Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was demonstrated  with  seroresponse rate defined as a four­
fold or greater rise in serum neutralization titer 28  days  post-booster dose relative  to  pre-booster dose. 
Across all variants  tested,  the levels  of neutralizing Ab  titers 28  days  post-booster dose observed  in  CoV2 
pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351  strain)  vaccine  group  were higher than  in  Pfizer COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine  group, 
with the  GMT ratio between 1.43  and 2.53. 
Immunogenicity results from Study VAT00002 (Cohort 2,  Beta arm) 
CoV2 pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351 strain) vaccine given  as  a  booster is  being evaluated in an  ongoing 
multicenter phase 3  clinical study  in  participants 18  years  of age and  older  in Australia,  France,  Honduras, 
Spain,  UK,  and United States. Per-protocol analysis  population  included 615 participants who received 
CoV2 pres  dTM-AS03  (B.1.351 strain) vaccine 4 to 10 months after  receiving  primary  vaccination  with 2 
doses  of  Pfizer  COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine  (nucleoside  modified) (n  = 325)  or  Moderna COVID-19  mRNA 
Vaccine (nucleoside modified) (n  = 93),  AstraZeneca  COVID-19  Vaccine (ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant]) (n  = 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 66/83 
94), Sanofi investigational primary vaccine (protein-based adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine, D614, 5 to  15 
µg of antigen dose) (n =  72), or with one dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S 
[recombinant]) (n  = 31). 
In per-protocol analysis population receiving CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351  strain) vaccine booster, the 
mean age of participants was 46.0 years (range  18  to 93 years); 435 (70.7%) were  18  to 55 years of age 
180 (29.3%) were 56 years of age and  older,  78 (1 2.7%) were 65 years of age and  older. Among them, 
47.0%  were male, 53.0% were female,  67.6% were White,  1 1.7% were Black or African  American,  3.4% 
American Indian or Alaska Native, and 2.9% were Asian. 
Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring neutralizing Ab titers (ID50) against a pseudo virus 
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from a USA_WAl/2020 isolate with the D614G mutation and 
B.1.351 variant using a SARS-CoV-2 Pseudo virus Neutralization Assay. 
A booster response to CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 (B.1.351 strain) vaccine was demonstrated regardless of the 
vaccine used for primary vaccination with the Geometric  Mean Titers Ratio (GMTR  [GMTR], fold  increase) 
14 days post-booster relative to pre-booster against B.1.351  strain ranging from 38.5 to  1 80,  and from 
14.5 to  148  for D614G strain. 
No new relevant efficacy and/or effectiveness findings in approved indications were identified during the 
reporting interval. 
Based on the review of the data received for Vaccine failure/VAED, a  total of eight cases (two serious and 
six non-serious) that reported  COVID-19 after vaccination. All were consumer reported cases with a BCCD 
level 5 assessment. These cases did not have sufficient data for a comprehensive evaluation; However, 
based on the limited information available, no cases reported VAED/VAERD and no cases reported lack of 
efficacy. Based on the medical review of cumulative safety data, no information on changes in the 
therapeutic environment could be identified that could  impact efficacy and/or effectiveness or lead to 
vaccine failure. 
No new relevant efficacy  findings in approved indications were  identified  during the reporting interval,  and 
the efficacy profile of COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted), is unchanged. 
The data  available from the studies performed for this vaccine remain the reference information on the 
robustness of the immune response elicited by the vaccine. No new immunogenicity  data that would put 
these conclusions in question have been made available during the reporting period. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
There are no  new data  on  efficacy that alters previous assessments. 
4.  Benefit-risk balance 
VidPrevtyn Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in adults who 
have previously received  an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
No new significant information that would impact the benefit-risk balance was identified during the 
assessment of the data in this PSUR. 
The update of the product information is recommended to include dizziness as a new adverse reaction to 
the section 4.8 of the SmPC  and  PIL. 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report

Based on the PRAC Rapporteur review of the available safety and efficacy/effectiveness data for 
VidPrevtyn Beta and with the recommended update of the PI, the benefit-risk balance of VidPrevtyn Beta 
remains unchanged. 
5.  Ra pporteur Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH is requested to propose a frequency of the new ADR Dizziness based on the available 
data. 
2.  The MAH is requested to provide information, why the exposures in Scotland, Wales and North 
Ireland were not included in the PSUR.

PSUR and in the Appendix 6.4.2. 
6.  MAH  responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH is requested to propose a frequency of the new ADR  Dizziness based on the available 
data. 
Response: 
Dizziness is an unspecific medical term which encompasses multiple different conditions. Generally, it 
can be differentiated into vertigo (affection of the vestibular  system),  disequilibrium (caused by 
Parkinson's disease or peripheral neuropathies), presyncope (with cardiovascular aetiology) or 
psychogenic light-headedness. 
Vertigo is the most common aetiology of dizziness, accounting for nearly half of cases referred to 
general practitioners, and it can be acute,  recurrent or chronic. Acute vertigo may result from a 
vertebrobasilar stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or from a vestibular neuritis (VN). Recurrent 
vertigo can be caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or by migraine (thus being 
called vestibular migraine, VM). Chronic vertigo includes rare conditions such Meniere's disease (MD) 
and persistent postural- perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Among  vertigos, BPPV is the most common, 
followed by VM and VN. Interestingly,  the male:female ratio among VM patients lays between  1: 1.5 
and 1:5, probably because of the greater prevalence of migraine among women. In a cross-sectional 
retrospective study, including 1535 patients who referred for dizziness to a tertiary care hospital, 
20% of them was diagnosed an acute syndrome, 35% of them an episodic syndrome, 5% a chronic 
syndrome, and in remaining 40% of cases the initial workup failed to make a clear diagnosis. 
According to follow-up data, 18% of initial diagnoses are not correct, and 45% of patients had no 
clear diagnosis  at the end of the follow-up. This observation is in agreement with the estimation that 
20% of patients referring for dizziness to  general practitioners do not receive a clear diagnosis. In a 
longitudinal prospective study including  1666 patients, stroke/TIA was diagnosed in 3.2% of patients 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page 68/83 
presenting  with dizziness,  vertigo,  or  imbalance.  Presence  of isolated  dizziness was negatively 
correlated  with  stroke/TIA diagnosis (p<0.01),  only  0.7%  of such  patients  having  been  diagnosed  a 
stroke/TIA. 
Other studies  investigated  the  interplay  between  psychogenic  factors  and  dizziness.  In a  cross­
sectional  study,  including 544  patients,  those who scored  worse  in  anxiety  and  depression 
psychometric  questionnaires  had  also greater scores in  dizziness  symptoms  questionnaires.  It has 
been showed  that such association  can  work in  both ways,  being anxiety  or  depression a  risk factor 
for  a  specific  dizziness  onset  as well as a  consequence  of recurrent  or chronic  dizziness  of  organic 
origin.  Interestingly,  a  case-control  study  including  92  BPPV  patients and  141 healthy  controls 
suggested  that women may  be more than men at risk of developing  anxiety  and  phobic  anxiety 
secondary  to  dizziness  experience.  Presyncope  is  the  prodrome  of syncope,  in  which the patient can 
display  autonomic  activation,  light- headedness,  or  palpitations,  basing  on  syncope aetiology,  before 
to lose consciousness. The  European Society  of Cardiology  (ESC)  resumed  the complex 
physiopathology  of syncope (Figure 1).  Elderly  patients are particularly vulnerable to  orthostatic 
hypotension,  because  of the addition  of primary age- related  autonomic nervous system failure (ANF) 
and  polymedication.  In facts,  anti-hypertensives,  antidepressants,  antiparkinsonian,  myorelaxants 
and  opioids  (which  are  commonly  prescribed  drugs  in  the elderly) can  induce  various degrees of 
secondary ANF. 
Clinical  Studies  (lnterventional) 
Dizziness was  collected  as  an unsolicited  adverse  event  (AE)  during  clinical  development  of COVID-19 
vaccine (VAT00002  Cohort  2  Clinical Study involving  705  participants 18  years  of age and  older  who 
received  the vaccine (Monovalent (B.1.351)  booster)  4  to  10  months  after receiving  primary 
vaccination and  VAT00002 Cohort 2/VAT00008  Stage 2  Clinical  study  involving an  additional  7093 
participants 18  years  of age and  older  having  received  primary  or  booster  vaccine formulation 
containing  the same  Beta antigen  (bivalent (B.1.351 + D614) formulation). 
In VAT00002  Cohort  2,  two (2)  participants  reported  non-serious  adverse  reactions  involving  the 
Preferred  Term (PT)  dizziness.  In  one (1)  case,  dizziness  occurred  the  same  day  of  vaccination  and 
participant recovered  2  days after;  in the  other case,  dizziness occurred  one  day after  vaccination and 
the participant  recovered  on  the same  day.  In both cases,  dizziness was  associated  with other AEs 
which could  be confounding factors in the occurrence of dizziness.  No related  AEs of dizziness were 
reported  in  the vaccine group  in  VAT00008  Stage 2. 
From the  COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted) Development  International  Birth Date (28 
August  2020)  up to  the  first  Marketing  Authorization (10  November 2022),  analysis  of unsolicited  AE 
from  VAT00002  Cohort  2  and  VAT00008  Stage 2  clinical studies  did  not conclude to select  dizziness 
as  part of the expected  AEs to  be mentioned  in  the  RSI. 
As  of 30  June 2023,  around  5000  participants received  a  booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant,  adjuvanted) in the  booster extension  phase  of VAT00008.  As  of the cut-off,  no AEs  of 
dizziness  have been  reported  in the booster extension. 
No (0) serious  adverse events (SAEs)  including  dizziness PT  have been reported  in any clinical trial. 
In conclusion,  during clinical development stage  of COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted),  the 
frequency and  characteristics  of reports  of  dizziness were  not  in  favor  of a  possible relationship 
between  administration  of COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted)  and  the occurrence of 
dizziness.

Cumulative  cases reports analysis 
Methodology 
A search from  10  November 2022 to  30 June 2023 was performed in the Sanofi Global PV database 
(encompassing post-marketing  cases and serious  cases and pregnancy exposures from clinical 
studies)  completed by  analysis of non-serious cases reporting  dizziness during  clinical studies. This 
search was performed to identify all solicited and unsolicited cases,  both Health Care Professional 
(HCP)  and non- HCP (consumer) of safety  signal(s)  reported after the use of VidPrevtyn Beta as a 
suspect drug  including  diagnosis and symptoms using  Medical  Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 26.0,  coded with the following PT:  Dizziness (MedDRA Code  10013573). 
Results 
From Sanofi  Global PV Database,  the search retrieved a total of 50  cases from post-marketing 
sources.  In addition, the 2 non-serious  cases which were retrieved from clinical studies,  were further 
analyzed and included in this analysis. Stratification by  source and seriousness is displayed in table

None (0) of the reported  cases had fatal outcome. 
Pattern Analysis 
Among the 50 cases with compatible chronology, 43 cases (86%) were reported in elderly patients, which 
is expected as per the indication of the  vaccine in elderly population. The majority of patients were female 
(27/50, 54%). The most  common time to dizziness onset was on  the same day  (22/50,  44%), 86% of 
cases having  occurred within 2 days from the vaccination  (43/50,  86%). At the time of reporting,  13 
patients  (26%)  had already  recovered  and  12 other patients (24%) were recovering.  Among  the patients 
who already recovered, 58% recovered within  one day after dizziness onset (7/ 11). The most frequent 
confounding factor was the treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs ( 14/50,  28%),  which again is 
expected  as per the indication of the vaccine in elderly population.

The most common High Level Terms (HLTs) of co-reported conditions were Asthenic conditions  (22/50, 
44%),  Nausea and vomiting symptoms  (15/50,  30%) and Breathing  abnormalities  (10/50, 20%) 
(Supplementary Table 2). 
Reported  dizziness was analyzed to be either as a  symptom of a  larger  diagnosis,  or  could the the 
consequence  of one of co-reported events mentioned above  (n=41), all listed except  dysponea,  with 
dyspnoea  being rather another expression of pain and  autonomous  nervous  hyperactivation  (refer  to 
section "Interpretation of observed pattern"). 
The analysis of isolated dizziness cases  (n=9) reveals that all cases were reported in elderly patients,  and 
most of them were females  (6/9, 67%). The most common time to  dizziness onset was on  the same day 
(3/9,  33%),  67% of  cases having occurred within 2 days from the vaccination  (6/9,  67%). At the time of 
reporting, 4 patients  (44%)  had already recovered and 1 other patient  (11 %) was recovering.  Among the 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report

patients who already recovered, 75% recovered within one day after dizziness onset (3/4). The most 
frequent confounding factor was the treatment with anti-hyperthensive drugs (3/9, 33%).

Case 
Case •••••■ reported by a consumer and involving a 77-year-old - who experienced 
dizziness, balance disorder and hypotension one day after receiving VidPrevtyn Beta. Patient had a 
medical history of breast cancer and an unspecified immunodeficiency. At the time of reporting, the 
recovery status was unknown. Based upon the reported information, the causal relationship between 
hypotension and dizziness could not be excluded. 
Case •••••■ reported by a HCP via the health authority and involving a 78-year-old -who 
experienced dizziness 2 days following the administration of VidPrevtyn Beta. The patient also 
experienced fatigue and nausea an unspecified time after the vaccination. According to the reporter, 
there were neither signs of BPPV nor of OHT. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 since having the 
vaccine .• concomitant medications included lansoprazole,  mirabegron and Plantago ovata. At the time 
of reporting, the patient was recovering. Based upon the reported information, differential diagnosis of 
dizziness was not completed, and thus the role of the vaccine could not be excluded nor retained. 
LITTERATURE 
Dizziness is a common medical condition which affects between  15%  and 35% of general population at 
least  once  during lifetime. Yearly incidence of dizziness has been estimated at 3.1 % (95% CI 2.6 - 3.8) 
in general population, with an higher incidence among women (4.1%, 95%  CI 3.2 - 5.0). Incidence 
among elderly people is several time higher, having been estimated between 10% and 31%. It has been 
estimated that dizziness accounts for 2.5% to 4% of emergency department (ED) consultations each year 
in the United States with a 37% increase from  1995 to 2004. Such rate is consistent with the 3.5% 
estimation made for an Italian ED, and rise up to 5% when we consider  dizziness cases on total of 
primary care clinic visits each year in the United States. 
A recent meta-analysis estimated that incidence of dizziness among COVID-19 patients is  12.2% (95%  CI 
7%  - 20%); nonetheless, such estimation is based on 9 studies with a low strength of evidence and with 
an high heterogeneity, so it should be cautiously interpretated. The proposed mechanisms linking SARS­
CoV-2 infection and dizziness onset are neuroinflammation or silent hypoxia of the inner ear. Among the 
COVID-19 vaccines currently available in Europe, dizziness is reported as an Uncommon adverse event in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of Comirnaty, Spikevax, Vaxzevria, Bimervax and 
Jcovden (but not in Nuvaxovid's). Of note, dizziness is also included in the paragraph "anxiety-related 
reactions" of the Comirnaty Sm PC, Section 4.4 "Special warnings and precautions for use". 
DISCUSSION 
Based on the post-marketing data retrieved, dizziness reporting rate was 2.36/100 000 people vaccinated 
(very rare event),  which  is below the baseline yearly incidence rate reported in literature (3.1%) 
PRAC PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page  75/83 
Furthermore,  the analysis of all retrieved dizziness cases showed a preponderance of non-serious cases, 
occurring in elderly women the same  day of vaccination, with a rapid  (1 day)  and benign resolution. 
INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVED PATTERN 
The Global Advisory Committee for Vaccine Safety included dizziness in the wide manifestations spectrum 
of immunization stress-related responses (ISRR),which ranges from tachycardia and headache to 
syncope,  hyperventilation syndrome and dissociative or conversion disorders. ISRR rises from autonomic 
nervous system overactivations, which can be strengthened in presence of psychological vulnerabilities or 
in particular social contexts.  The female-to-male ratio in retrieved cases, together with the short time  to 
onset,  rather  drive  the interpretation of reported dizziness toward  a  condition  driven  by psychogenic 
factors, in agreement with the findings of Staab et al.  et  Ferrari et al.  In particular, it can be confidently 
assumed that the vaccination campaign is a stressful context,  especially for elder people,  and that this 
factor can add to pre-existent depression or anxiety disorders,  ending  up in  psychosomatic manifestations 
like the reported dizziness.  Furthermore, the stressful vaccination campaign  could have triggered a BPPV 
recrudescence, in agreement with findings of Monzani et al. and with the fact that BPPV is an 
underdiagnosed condition of which many patients are still unaware of. 
The most frequently reported PTs in the retrieved cases were nausea, fatigue, malaise, pain and 
dyspnoea. Whereas the three first symptoms are immediately relatable to an autonomous nervous 
activation, and thus to an ISRR, the last two deserves a further comment. In a large retrospective cohort 
study based on 266,000  electronic patients records, Clark et al. found that pain and dyspnoea are closely 
related.  In their logistic regression, patients with pain complaints were still more at risk to complain for 
dyspnoea,  even after adjusting for pulmonary diseases known to induce dyspnoea itself.  This finding 
could  account for a shared visceral receptorial downstream pathway, which make patients feel to breathe 
worse when they are in  pain.  Such  element can be immediately translated to  our  data, allowing  us to 
conclude that reported  dyspnoea  does not  depend  on anaphylactoid reactions or other  pulmonary 
aetiologies,  but is rather another expression of pain and autonomous nervous hyperactivation. 
EXCLUDED DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES 
The substantial lack of co-reported neurologic conditions such as sensory-motor deficits or speech 
disorders, as well as the  reassuring follow-up data,  excludes  the link between reported dizziness cases 
and possible vertebrobasilar strokes or TIA.  This interpretation is fully in agreement with the findings of 
Kerber et al., who remind that patients  referring  for dizziness rarely have a cerebrovascular accident. In 
several  of reported  cases,  asthenia  and  headache  have been  reported  together with  dizziness.  While 
these subjective symptoms are widely recognized as reactogenicity manifestations,  because of their 
known inflammatory pathogenesis,  [21] no systemic inflammation pathways are known yet to be linked 
with dizziness.  Thus, in the present analysis we did not consider  dizziness as a possible manifestation of 
vaccine-induced systemic reactogenicity. In other reported cases, nausea and dyspnoea have  been 
reported  together with dizziness.  Such conditions may be the consequence of a  systemic type I immune 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
CONFOUNDING  FACTORS 
More than one third of patients who reported dizziness were also treated  with anti-hypertensives, anti­
depressants, hormones or immunosuppressants.  These molecules, according to their pharmacodynamics, 
may represent a potential  confounding factor in the present analysis,  even in  patients which are taking 
them on the long  course.  Here we discuss two potential mechanisms of confounding. 
PRAC PSUR  assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/516634/2023 
Page  76/83 
Firstly,  long  courses  of  anti-hypertensive  drugs  are known to  induce  ANF,  as explained  in  the  ESC 
guidelines for diagnosis and management of syncope. This is  usually not a  concern,  as long  as  treatment 
is tailored  and  patient stays  compliant.  Nonetheless,  ANF is an  acquired  risk factor which may contribute 
to the dysregulated neurovegetative activation which  occurs  in  ISRR. 
Secondly,  it  should  be  reminded that medication errors are  quite a common issue with that  kind  of  drugs. 
Since dizziness  is a  highly  subjective condition,  and pharmacokinetics may  vary  widely  across individuals, 
it could not be excluded  that  even  a "simple" double dose  of anti-hypertensive,  anti-depressant  or 
thyroxine  could  have  induced a  temporary  dizziness  (which  is  indeed  listed  as  a  potential  AE in the vast 
majority  of SmPC  of such  drug  classes).  Data  provided in  reported cases was not sufficient  to  confidently 
exclude such  event. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on  medical review of cases of dizziness reported after the use  of  COVID-19  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted),  the cumulative  evidence  is  considered not evocative  of  a  causal association  between 
dizziness  as  an  isolated  event  and COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant,  adjuvanted).The collected  evidence is 
in  favour  of  an association  between  dizziness  and  the vaccination act  itself  (with  no  regard  to  the injected 
product)  as  part  as  procedure-related  psychogenic reactions.  Nonetheless,  since "anxiety-related 
reactions" are already  mentioned in  section  4.4  paragraph  three  of the Sm PC's  characteristics,  no further 
update  is  deemed necessary. 
Dizziness safety  topic  remains  under close monitoring and further assessments will be  performed as 
needed 
The following  table  of the cases  supporting the causal relationship between VidPrevtyn  Beta and dizziness 
was  created by the PRAC Rapporteur based  on  the  data provided by the MAH.

Rapporteur assessment comment: 
During  the developmental program  2 participants experienced the  non-serious AE of  dizziness.  In  the  1st 
case,  a  23-year-old - experienced dizziness, vision blurred, taste disorder,  lethargy,  nausea and 
fatigue with TTO 1 day, which subsided the same day. The delayed onset acts against the immunisation­
stress related reaction  (ISRR). In the  2
case, a 66-year-old �xperienced several events including 
dizziness,  fatigue, abdominal pain, dry mouth, dry skin,  insomnia, external ear pain on the day of 
vaccination without exact time specification.  The  events subsided  after  2 days.  No further details were 
provided.  No case of dizziness was reported during the booster extension phase of VAT00008. 
nd 
The MAH provided an  updated review of dizziness from the post-marketing period until 30 June 2023.  50 
cases of  dizziness were reported cumulatively.  32/50  cases are  not medically confirmed. This can be 
expected considering the  number of  non-serious cases  (3 1/50)  and subjective character of the reaction. 
43/50  (86%)  cases were reported  in elderly, which is in  line with the exposure data of the vaccine. 
Dizziness was reported slightly more often in women, in 27/50  (54%)  cases.  No data about exposure by 
sex was provided in the PSUR.  However,  as the vast majority of doses was administered in the age 
groups of  70-79 years and  80+  years,  it might be assumed that elderly women were vaccinated more 
often than  men.  The MAH , s comment that the higher proportion of women suggests a psychogenic 
nature of the reaction is not endorsed. At the time of reporting, patients recovered or  were recovering in 
25/50  (50%)  cases. 
Dizziness occurred the same day in  22/50  (44%)  cases, TTO  1 -2 days was reported in  21/50 (42%) 
cases, TTO 3 days was reported  in  1/50  (2%) cases and TTO was u nknown  in  6/50  (12%)  cases. 
The most common co-reported PTs were  nausea (14/50), pain (13/50), fatigue  (11/50), malaise  (11/50) 
and dyspnoea (10/50).  Only dizziness was  reported  in  9 cases.  The  MAH  concluded that dizziness was a 
symptom of  a larger  diagnosis or  the consequence of co-reported  events and the data  indicates an 
association between dizzi ness and the vaccination  act  itself. This is not endorsed.  The PRAC Rapp agrees 
that the most often  co-reported reactions can  occur as symptoms of the  immunisation-stress related 
reaction already  included  in  the product information of the vaccine,  but  these  events  except dyspnoea are 
also the expected reactogenicity reactions listed for VidPrevtyn Beta. In addition,  dizziness is  a listed ADR 
for  other COVID-19 vaccines including recombi nant, adjuvanted vaccine Bimervax. 
The PRAC Rapp created a table of  21 cases  (please see above  this comment), where delayed TTO  acts 
against the ISRR or where  dizziness occurred with  other symptoms of reactogenicity,  and  these cases 
suggest a causal relationship between  VidPrevtyn Beta  and  dizziness. 
Considering that a total of  2949 participants received the monovalent beta B. 1.351 booster vaccine 
during all clinical studies 1 -3 Phase and 5000  participants received a booster  dose of the vaccine in the 
booster extension phase of  VAT0000B. the  PRAC  Rapp proposes to include dizziness  in the product 
information with a frequency "rare".

2.  The MAH is requested to provide information, why the exposures in Scotland, Wales and North 
Ireland were not included in the PSUR. 
Response: 
Scotland,  Wales and  North Ireland exposures are not  included  in the PSUR as not available from 
Department for Business,  Energy & Industrial  Strategy from the UK Government which is the source 
to track doses administered in the United  Kingdom.  Only doses  administered  in  England are  available. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The information is acknowledged. 
3.  The MAH  is  requested to clarify discrepancy between number of stroke  cases  listed in  the 
body  of PSUR  and in  the Appendix 6.4.2. 
Response: 
has been received after 9 May 2023 and included in this analysis which 
Six  case reports of stroke are listed in the body of PSUR  (refer to 15.1.1.14 Stroke  (haemorrhagic 
stroke and ischemic stroke)) and seven case reports of stroke are listed in Appendix  6.4.2.  This is 
explained by the note highlighting the differences between PSUR DLP (09 May 2023) and 
Observed/Expected analysis DLP  (31 May 2023): 
* Case 
corresponds to the second summary safety report (DLP:  31 May 2023). A 77-year-old -patient, 
with past medical history including stroke (12 years ago) and arterial disorder NOS, experienced TIA 
(transient ischemic attack), was unable to say any word  (speech disorder),  only. could make noises 
and unable to think  {thinking  abnormal) 2 days after vaccination with VidPrevtyn Beta.  At  the time of 
the event, the patient had ongoing slurred speech.  No information on  diagnostic  tests was provided. 
Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic  acid  (aspirin); bisoprolol; lansoprazole;  finasteride; 
citalopram;  losartan;  atorvastatin;  cod-liver oil;  vitamins and  clopidogrel.  Twelve years ago, the 
patient had a stroke and recovered from it .•  had no problem  since then.  According to the patient, 
when■ had the first stroke 12 years ago, I felt  (inaudible)  down and felt empty .• is feeling better 
now.  It was not reported if the patient received a  corrective treatment for the events.  Comment: 
Previous occurrence  of stroke and  unspecified  arterial disorder are  major  confounders,  as well as the 
patient's elderly age.  Stroke was not  confirmed by diagnostic  tests.  No information on  previous 
primary vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH  clarified that the discrepancy in the  number  of stroke  cases was a  result of the difference in 
dates between the PSUR DLP and  O/E  analysis DLP.  One additional case was provided, which is already 
described in  the Appendix of PSUR as a  case of ischaemic stroke reported after DLP.  However,  the 
difference in number of stroke  cases between the PSUR body and the Appendix 6.4.2 is higher.  6 cases of 
stroke  (haemorrhagic  or  ischaemic)  are described in  the body of the PSUR and 13 cases  (7  cases of 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment report

Page 82/83 
ischaemic stroke and  6  cases  of haemorrhagic stroke) are  described  in  the Appendix. 
In  the next  PSUR,  the MAH  is  requested  to  provide a review of the 6  stroke cases which were not 
assessed  in the current  PSUR.  Next  PSUR

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report for Recombinant Prefusion Spike DeltaTM Protein (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 Strain) Vaccine, hereafter referred to as "COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted)", was prepared in accordance with the content and format proposed by the 
International Conference on Harmonisation guideline (ICH E2C  [R2] step 5): Periodic Benefit Risk 
Evaluation Report and Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module VII - Periodic Safety 
Update Report (revision #1 ). 
It summarizes the cumulative safety information for the marketing authorization holder products 
containing COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted), received by the Sanofi's Global

COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group "Vaccine", 
"Other Viral Vaccine"; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code: J07BX03. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is a recombinant protein vaccine derived from the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 prefusion Spike delta TM (B. 1 .3 5 1  strain). COVID- 1 9  
vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is an adjuvanted vaccine composed of the soluble trimeric severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 recombinant spike protein (B. 1 .35 1  strain) stabilized in its 
prefusion conformation and deleted of its transmembrane and intracellular domains. The combination of 
antigen and adjuvant enhances the magnitude of immune response, which may contribute to protection 
against Coronavirus Disease-201 9. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is available as solution and emulsion for emulsion for 
injection. The volume after mixing one vial of antigen solution (2.5 mL) with one vial of adjuvant 
emulsion (2.5 mL) allows for delivery of 1 0  doses of vaccine (0.5 mL per dose). One dose (0.5 mL) of 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) contains five micrograms of recombinant severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 spike protein (B. 1 .3 5 1  strain) formulated with adjuvant system 03 
adjuvant for booster vaccination and is administered intramuscularly. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is approved as a booster dose for active immunization to 
prevent Coronavirus Disease-201 9  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in adults 
who have previously received a messenger ribonucleic acid or adenoviral vector Coronavirus 
Disease-201 9  vaccine.

Approved posology: 
Individuals 18 years of age and older 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 
0.5 mL at least four months after a previous Coronavirus Disease-201 9  vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) may be given once as a booster to adults that have received prior vaccination 
series with either messenger ribonucleic acid or adenoviral vector Coronavirus Disease-201 9  vaccines. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals 2'.: 65 years of age. 
Pediatric population 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is not indicated in pediatric population. 
A global safety data exchange agreement is in place between Sanofi Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals SA for multiple territories. This Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report includes all 
individual case safety reports received by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA and transmitted to Sanofi 
Pasteur. 
The first marketing authorization for COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) was obtained in the 
European Union on 1 0  November 2022. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is approved in 32 countries worldwide. 
During the period covered by this report, a marketing authorization for COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) was granted in Great Britain on 20 December 2022. 
Cumulatively, there were 1 7  132 participants exposed to COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) 
in marketing authorization holder sponsored interventional clinical trials. 
Exposure data based on administered doses when available have been retrieved from publicly available 
data sources such as national or international Coronavirus Disease-201 9  vaccination trackers. For 
European Union/European Economic Area countries, administered doses are retrieved from the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Vaccine Tracker1• European Union/European 
Economic Area countries can upload data at any time, but as a minimum they are requested to report 
twice a week ( on Tuesdays for the previous week and Thursdays for the current week). Considering this 
reporting timeframe and the time European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control needs to process

the data, some discrepancies may be observed between the figures published by European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control and the ones presented in official national reports or websites. It is 
worthy to note that all data are subject to retrospective corrections. In addition, for some countries, 
number of doses administered by age-group is not available, for others vaccine breakdown by vaccine 
brand name is not available. No stratification by gender is available. 
Cumulatively, the total number of doses of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered 
is approximately 6920 up to 20 April 2023 in European Union. 
Cumulatively, the total number of doses of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered 
is approximately 1  630 039 up to 07 May 2023 in England. 
Cumulatively, the total number of doses of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered 
is approximately 1  636 959 up to 07 May 2023. 
The European Union summary of product characteristics for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted), version 1 .0 dated I O  November 2022 was the reference safety information valid at the 
beginning of the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report period. 
No safety related changes were made in the reference safety information during the period covered by 
this report. 
No actions were taken for safety reasons during the period covered by this report. 
Since the data lock point for this Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report, the marketing authorization 
holder has identified the following new information regarding potentially important safety and efficacy 
and/or effectiveness: one signal on allergic including anaphylactic reactions has been opened on 
1 7  May 2023 and validated on 1 4  June 2023. On 26 June 2023, signal of allergic including anaphylactic 
reactions was confirmed as an identified risk. The weighted cumulative evidence was considered 
sufficient to support a causal association between COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) and 
allergic including anaphylactic reactions that should be reflected in the reference safety information. 
Based on the evaluation of the cumulative safety data and the benefit-risk analysis during the reporting 
interval, the benefit-risk balance of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) in the approved 
indication remains positive in the currently approved conditions of use.

COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is a recombinant protein vaccine derived from the 
SARS CoV-2 prefusion Spike (S) delta TM (CoV-2 preS dTM ) (B. 1 .351 strain). COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) is an adjuvanted vaccine composed of the soluble trimeric SARS-CoV-2 
recombinant S protein (B. 1 .351 strain) stabilized in its prefusion conformation and deleted of its 
transmembrane and intracellular domains. The combination of antigen and adjuvant enhances the 
magnitude of immune response, which may contribute to protection against COVID-1 9. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is available as solution and emulsion for emulsion for 
injection. The volume after mixing one vial of antigen solution (2.5 mL) with one vial of adjuvant 
emulsion (2.5 mL) allows for delivery of 1 0  doses of vaccine (0.5 mL per dose). One dose (0.5 mL) of 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) contains five micrograms of recombinant 
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (B. 1 .35 1  strain) formulated with adjuvant system 03 (AS03) adjuvant for 
booster vaccination and is administered intramuscularly. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is approved as a booster dose for active immunization to 
prevent COVID-1 9  caused by SARS-Co V-2 in adults who have previously received a messenger

ESTIMATED EXPOSURE AND USE PATTERNS 
5.1 
CUMULATIVE SUBJECT EXPOSURE IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
This section presents estimates of cumulative numbers of participants, from ongoing or completed 
MAH-sponsored clinical trials where COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) was the 
investigational product under study or development, exposed to the investigational product, placebo, 
and/or active comparator(s) since the development international birth date (DIBD). 
The cumulative exposure to COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted), in interventional clinical 
trials sponsored by the MAH is estimated to be 1 7  1 32 participants. Actual exposure data from 
completed or open-label clinical trials (Note: none of the three ongoing clinical studies have been 
completed as of the DLP) and enrollment estimates according to randomization schemes for ongoing 
and blinded trials are presented in Table 1 .  Cumulative exposure to COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted), is displayed as SARS-Co V-2 preS dTM monovalent and bivalent. Comparing the 
cumulative participant exposure numbers to previous reports is not appropriate as participants progress 
from dose 1 to dose 2.

Number of Participants 
As of 09 May 2023  (DLP), a total of 2949 participants received the monovalent beta B. 1 .3 51 booster 
vaccme. 
The cumulative exposure of COVID- 1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) by demographic 
characteristics of age range, gender, and race/ethnicity is listed in Appendix 5.2. 1 .  
5.2 
CUMULATIVE AND INTERVAL PATIENT EXPOSURE FROM MARKETING EXPERIENCE 
5.2.1  Post-approval (non-clinical trial) exposure 
As this is the first PBRER, the interval and cumulative patient exposure are the same and are presented 
below. Therefore, Appendix 5.2.2 and Appendix 5.2.3 are not applicable. 
Exposure data based on administered doses when available have been retrieved from publicly available 
data sources such as national or international COVID- 1 9  vaccination trackers. For EU/ European 
Economic Area (EEA) countries, administered doses are retrieved from the European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) Vaccine Tracker2•  European Union/European Economic Area countries 
can upload data at any time, but as a minimum they are requested to report twice a week ( on Tuesdays 
for the previous week and Thursdays for the current week). Considering this reporting timeframe and the 
time ECDC needs to process the data, some discrepancies may be observed between the figures 
published by ECDC and the ones presented in official national reports or websites. It is worthy to note 
that all data are subject to retrospective corrections. In addition, for some countries, number of doses 
administered by age-group is not available, for others vaccine breakdown by vaccine brand name is not 
available. No stratification by gender is available. 
The number of doses of COVID- 1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) administered per European country 
and age group as of 20 April 2023 are presented in Table 2.

5.2.2  Post-approval use in special populations 
The MAH does not have access to exposure regarding use in special populations from the IBD of 
COVID- 1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) through the DLP of the PBRER except for elderly 
population as more than 99.8% of the exposure in England is in elderly population which represents 
1  627 026 doses administered (60 years and older (Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial 
Strategy from the UK government). 
Use in the pregnancy and breast-feeding is being studied in non-interventional studies with study 
ID VAT00012 and VAT00007 (not yet initiated). No exposure in these studies. Use in the pregnancy 
and breast-feeding is missing information. Please refer to Section 1 6  for further information. 
•  Of note, feasibility of VAT00006 Clinical Study (A Phase  3, Randomized, Modified 
Double-Blind, Crossover Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of a SARS-Co V-2 
Adjuvanted Recombinant Protein Variant Booster Vaccine in Healthy Pregnant Women Aged 1 8

and it has been cancelled. The rationale of this decision has been included in an Answers to 
Questions document submitted to European Medicines Agency (EMA) through a procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/005754/MEA/001). According to the review timetable, the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) outcome is expected on 20 July 2023. 
Use in the immuno-compromised subjects is being studied in externally sponsored collaborative (ESC) 
studies with study ID VAT00027, VAT00028 and in non-interventional study ID VAT00007 (not yet 
initiated). Cumulative exposure in these studies is 32 participants. Use in the immuno-compromised 
subjects is missing information. Please refer to Section 1 6  for further information. 
Use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities (eg, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders [CVD]) 
is being studied in non-interventional studies with study ID VAT00007 (not yet initiated). No exposure 
in this study. Use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities (eg, COPD, 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, CVD) is missing information. Please refer to Section 1 6  for 
further information. 
Use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders is being studied in non-
interventional studies with study ID VAT00007 (not yet initiated). No exposure in this study. Use in 
subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders is missing information. Please refer to Section 1 6  
for further information. 
Use in elderly: 
In the UK, country where most doses were administered, the local recommendation is targeting the 
population aged 75-year-old and above. Thus, most of the postmarketing cases are reported in the older 
population (See Section 5.2. 1) with approximately 86% of cases reported in 70-year-old and above. 
Safety data presented in this PBRER can be considered as reflecting the safety data in this age group. 
5.2.3  Other post-approval  use 
No patterns of use with COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) beyond that recommended in the 
reference product information, including overdose, drug abuse and misuse considered relevant for the 
interpretation of safety data were identified.

REFERENCE INFORMATION 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 26.0 was used for the coding of 
adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and for analyses based on Standardized 
MedDRA Queries (SMQ). 
6.2 
CUMULATIVE SUMMARY TABULATIONS OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS FROM 
CLINICAL TRIALS 
Appendix 2.1 provides the cumulative tabulation of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported from 
MAH-sponsored, interventional clinical trials where the COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) 
was the product under investigation. 
The cumulative SAE tabulation is presented by treatment arm for completed or unblinded trials and 
blinded for ongoing blinded trials. 
A total of 902 cumulative SAEs were reported from MAH-sponsored clinical trials. 
6.3 
CUMULATIVE AND INTERVAL SUMMARY TABULATIONS FROM POSTMARKETING DATA 
SOURCES 
The tabulation in Appendix 2.2 includes: 
•  Serious and non-serious adverse drug reactions from spontaneous ICSRs, including reports from 
healthcare professional (HCPs), consumers, scientific literature, and RAs; 
•  Serious adverse reactions (SARs) from non-interventional studies and 
•  Solicited reports of SARs.3 
As described in ICH Guideline E2D, for marketed medicinal products, spontaneously reported AEs 
imply suspicion of causality by the reporter and are therefore considered to be adverse reactions (ARs) 
for regulatory reporting purposes. 
A total of 1227 cumulative ARs have been reported, all of which were reported during the present 
reporting period for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) (see Appendix 2.2. 1). 
A total of 1 9  cumulative ARs have been reported, all of which were reported during the present 
reporting period for an unknown manufacturer (UNK MFR) (see Appendix 2.2.2).

SUM MARIES OF SIG NIFICANT FINDINGS FROM CLINICAL TRIALS 
DURING THE REPORTING INTERVAL 
During the reporting interval of this PBRER, no clinical trials have been completed. As of 09 May 2023 
(DLP), a total of three clinical trials (Y AT0000 1 ,  V AT00002, V AT00008) are ongoing. 
There were no MAH-sponsored interventional trials ongoing or completed during the reporting period 
with the primary aim of identifying, characterizing, or quantifying a safety hazard or confirming the 
safety profile of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). Therefore, Appendix 4. 1  is not 
applicable.

7.2  ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS 
VAT0000l: A parallel group, Phase I/II, first in human, placebo controlled, dose ranging, multi-center 
study with a Sentinel Safety Cohort and Early Safety Data Review (ESDR) to assess immunogenicity 
and safety of SARS-Co V-2 recombinant protein vaccine formulations (two antigen formulations [high 
or low dose] with either AF03 or AS03 as adjuvants, or no adjuvant for the high antigen dose 
formulation) and injection schedule (one or two injections) in healthy adults 1 8  years of age and older 
(1), (2). 
All vaccination in the study occurred prior to the review period. The safety follow-up period of the study 
has been completed. No safety issue was identified during the long-term safety follow-up. The clinical 
study report is currently under development. 
VAT00002: A Phase II randomized, modified double-blind, multicenter, dose finding study has been 
conducted in adults 1 8  years of age and older to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity 
of two injections of five µg, 1 0  µg, or 1 5  µg of the CoV2 preS dTM (D6 1 4) vaccine, adjuvanted with 
AS03. Interim data from this Phase II study was used to decide on progression to Phase III and to select 
an antigen dose formulation for further clinical development evaluating the vaccines when used as a late 
booster (3).

Supplemental cohorts were tested as part ofVAT00002 Phase II/III study to address various prime boost 
options (the Monovalent B. 1 .351 [Beta variant] formulation was used in the Supplemental Phase III 
Cohort 2) (4). 
•  Supplemental Phase III Cohort 1 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
the parental strain (Monovalent D614) vaccine among adults previously vaccinated with a 
primary series of mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) or adenovirus-vectored vaccines 
(Janssen or AstraZeneca). 
•  Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
a variant vaccine (Monovalent B. 1 .35 1  [Beta variant] or Bivalent [D61 4/B. 1 .3 5 1 ]) in adults 
previously primed with mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines. 
• 
In addition, available and willing individuals previously primed with the adjuvanted recombinant 
protein vaccine ( different formulations) as part of the Phase II Original Cohort were enrolled into 
the Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and randomized to a booster dose of the parental strain 
booster vaccine or Monovalent variant booster vaccine. 
•  Selection of the five µg dose was based on the immunogenicity results in non-naive participants 
of the original cohort ofVAT00002. 
•  All vaccination for the Original Phase II cohort (primary series) occurred prior to the review 
period. The safety follow-up of the Original Cohort was completed prior to the review period. 
No related SAEs and no AESI reported in the original cohort. No safety issue was identified for 
the Original Cohort following completion of the safety follow-up. 
•  Vaccination for the Supplemental Cohorts in the Phase III portion of the VAT00002 study 
occurred prior to the review period. Overall, no safety concerns were identified, nor any specific 
risk group identified for whom safety was of concern. Among participants receiving booster 
vaccine, there was a favorable safety profile. The safety profile was consistent across booster 
formulations. No safety issues were identified in subgroups ( defined by age or the presence of a 
high-risk medical condition). These safety data were supportive of the use of the vaccine as a 
booster, regardless of priming vaccine. The safety data were consistent with and further supports 
the safety profile established with the primary series formulation seen in the V AT00002 Phase II 
Original Cohort and other studies. 
VAT00008: This is a phase III randomized, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-stage, 
multi-center, multi-country study being conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of 
two CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 vaccines (Monovalent [original variant first identified in Wuhan; D614] and 
Bivalent; D61 4/B. 1 .35 1 )  in adults 1 8  years of age and older with two stages as a primary series and 
open-label extension to assess immunogenicity, safety, efficacy of a Monovalent (B. 1 .351) booster dose 
of SARS-Co V-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine. 
•  For stage 1 ,  1 0  µg antigen Monovalent D61 4  adjuvanted vaccine is evaluated against placebo. 
This antigen dose level selection mitigates the risk of having lower antibody (Ab) titers against

variants that would be circulating at the time of the efficacy study with potential to result in 
lower observed vaccine efficacy (VE) for the Monovalent D6 l 4 vaccine. 
•  For stage 2, five µg (D614 component) + five µg (B. 1 .351 component) antigen dose (Bivalent 
[D614/B. 1 .351] adjuvanted vaccine) is evaluated against placebo. It is reasonable to expect that 
similar homologous responses would be elicited by the B. 1 .351 component of the bivalent 
vaccine. Thus, by design, the inclusion of the B. 1 .351 antigen with the D61 4 antigen in the 
bivalent vaccine mitigates the risk of lower Ab responses against circulating variants anticipated 
with the Monovalent D614 vaccine. 
•  A booster extension: all participants enrolled in Stages 1 and 2 are offered a Monovalent 
(B. 1 .351) booster dose if they are eligible and if they consent to receive it. A safety follow-up of 
12 months after booster administration is implemented (unsolicited AE, medically attended 
adverse event [MAAE], SAE, and adverse event of special interest [AESI]) (5). 
No safety concern was raised from the VAT00008 study for the monovalent or bivalent vaccine 
formulations. 
There was no new clinically important information arising from studies ongoing during the reporting 
interval. 
7.3 
LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP 
No significant safety findings have been identified during the reporting interval in the long-term 
follow-up in studies VAT00002 and VAT00008. 
7.4  OTHER THERAPEUTIC USE OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Not applicable; no expanded access programs, compassionate use programs, particular patient use, 
single patient Investigational New Drugs (INDs) or treatment INDs were ongoing or completed during 
the reporting interval.

VAT00012: This is an international, non-interventional, postmarketing cohort study designed to collect 
prospective safety data among women vaccinated with a COVID-1 9  vaccine during pregnancy or within 
30 days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). 
The study population includes two cohorts of pregnant women 1 8  years of age and older matched by 
country and gestational age (±two weeks): 
•  Cohort 1 : pregnant women exposed from 3 0 days prior to the first day of the LMP to end of 
pregnancy to at least one dose of a COVID-1 9  vaccine. These participants are enrolled as part of 
the Coronavirus Disease-201 9  Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C-VIPER). 
•  Cohort 2: pregnant women unexposed to a COVID-1 9  vaccine during pregnancy. These 
participants are enrolled through the Pregistry International Pregnancy Exposure Registry with 
the same methods as those in Cohort 1 .  Women vaccinated before 30 days prior to the first day 
of the LMP are eligible for inclusion. 
The total duration of the study is five years. Obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes will be assessed on 
an ongoing basis as data become available. Data on pregnancy, neonatal and infant outcomes will be 
included in the interim reports. 
There were no safety or efficacy findings relevant to the benefit-risk assessment identified from the 
non-interventional study during the reporting interval. 
A listing of all MAH-sponsored non-interventional studies completed or ongoing during the reporting 
period, and with the primary aim of identifying, characterizing, quantifying a safety hazard, confirming

V AT00026: This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an additional dose 
of prototype and variant (alone or in combination) vaccine candidates in previously vaccinated 
participants with or without prior SARS Co V-2 infection. The participants should have had a primary 
series of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine plus a booster to be eligible for 
participation in this trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05289037). 
VAT00027: This study is an open label, non-randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a dose of the Sanofi-GSK Monovalent (B. 1 .35 1) Co V2 preS dTM-AS03 COVID-1 9  
vaccine in kidney transplant recipients with a persistently low SARS-CoV-2 Ab titer (ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: NCT0551 8487). 
VAT00028: This is a randomized, multi-site, adaptive, open-label clinical trial comparing the immune 
response to different additional doses of COVID-1 9  vaccine in participants with autoimmune disease 
requiring immunosuppressive medications (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0500021 6). 
There were no safety or efficacy findings relevant to the benefit-risk assessment in other clinical trials or 
study sources during the reporting period. 
9.2  MEDICATION ERRORS 
Medication Error coding in the Sanofi GPV database follows MedDRA introductory guide and 
MedDRA Term Selection - Points to Consider. 
Events are coded in the GPV database utilizing the medication error preferred terms (PTs) as reported 
and assessed against the locally approved product information. 
The MAH routinely screens multiple data sources to identify new safety information on medication 
errors. Data sources routinely screened to identify relevant new safety information are listed in 
Section 15. 
Refer to Appendix 6.2. 1 and Appendix 6.2.2 for the numbers of PTs in the broad MedDRA SMQ 
"Medication errors " reported with serious or non-serious adverse reactions from post-authorization 
sources for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) and UNK MFR, respectively. Appendix 6.2. 1 
and Appendix 6.2.2 complies with the expectations defined in Table A2-1  in the good practice guide on 
recording, coding, reporting, and assessment of medication errors for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) and UNK MFR, respectively. As, there are no "Medication errors" reported with serious or 
non-serious adverse reactions from post-authorization sources for UNK MFR; therefore, Appendix 6.2.2 
is not applicable. 
During the reporting period, the most frequently reported PTs within the Medication error SMQ with 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) are presented in Table 4.

Serious medically significant case 
reported by a consumer: A 77-year­
old patient experienced myalgia on 
the day of vaccination. The patient 
consulted a general physician and 
was advised to rest for three days 
and take paracetamol. The 
consumer thinks the reaction 
occurred as a result of a mistake 
made in the administration of the 
vaccine. At time of reporting, the 
patient was recovering. 
Serious medically significant case 
reported by other health 
professional: An 82-year-old patient 
experienced localized erythema on 
an unknown time after vaccination. 
Initially the area was extensive on 
mid-level of deltoid muscle, 
described as six-seven cm round 
with significant depth and painful 
swelling with tenderness. It lasted 
for three days then became 
increasingly erythematous and 
acutely painful. A medication error 
was reported: "vaccination 
administered halfway up deltoid 
muscle, client described hitting the 
bone with the needle." At the time 
of reporting, the patient was 
recovering. 
Serious medically significant case 
reported by a consumer: A 45-year­
old  patient experienced malaise, 
diarrhea, abdominal pain upper, 
and fatigue four days after booster 
administration. Concomitant 
medications included pregabalin;

asthenia, vaccination site bruising 
and lymphadenopathy the day of 
vaccination. As  per reporter, this 
reaction occurred as a result of a 
mistake made in the administration 
of the vaccine:  It was administered 
rapidly without due care and 
attention. This was the first time a 
COVID injection had been 
administered one inch below the 
top of the patient's shoulder. The 
nurse suggested the burning pain 
was caused by the blunt needle. 
Non-serious case reported by a

arm, diarrhea, and feeling unwell 
and unknown time after 
vaccination. As per reporter, 
injection was made in unhygienic

syringe in a clear plastic box 
containing many already made-up 
mixtures of supposed injection", 
"injection needle exposed to the air 
as box was uncovered in a shop). 
Non-serious case reported by a 
consumer who experienced 
diarrhea an unknown time after 
vaccination. As per reporter, this 
reaction occurred as a result of a 
mistake made in the administration 
of the vaccine: the patient was 
under anticoagulation medication 
when the patient received the 
vaccine and realized that it is not 
advised to have this vaccine when 
taking medication to prevent blood 
clots.

There were no relevant safety findings on patterns of medication errors and potential medication errors 
identified which would require specific risk minimization measures (RMM) at this time. The 
information on patterns of medication errors and potential medication errors does not change the overall

1 1   LITERATURE 
This section summarizes new and significant safety findings from literature relevant to COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) that the MAH became aware of during the reporting interval. 
In accordance with the GVP, the MAH is screening literature articles to search for any new and 
significant safety findings, either published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature or made available as 
unpublished manuscripts when relevant to the medicinal product. If relevant and applicable, information 
on other active substances of the same class should be considered. 
Commencement of literature screening has been determined by the last date of package submission of 
the MA application(s) for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) (March 2022) and a broad 
strategy has been applied with search criteria including any COVID-1 9  vaccine product, irrespective of 
manufacturer or vaccine technology, and a report of AE(s) without restriction by seriousness or severity 
as stated in EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 1 .0 DLP 08 November 2022. In the Responses to 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) Rapporteur Rolling review RMP final 
assessment report received on 01 October 2021 and in EU RMP version  1 .0 DLP 08 November 2022, 
the following is stated: "as knowledge of the SARS-Co V-2 virus, COVID-1 9  and vaccines evolves, it is 
expected that the above strategies will likewise change evolve". Indeed, the MAH would propose to 
implement a focused strategy with search criteria on protein and/or nano particle and/or adjuvanted 
COVID-1 9  vaccine product now that safety profiles of other COVID-1 9  vaccine platforms are 
considered stabilized with millions of doses distributed and taken into account that they are closely 
monitored by their respective MAHs. 
Records identified are reviewed for periodic report inclusion using the criteria below: 
•  Publications describing non-case safety topics for Sanofi products 
•  Publications describing medication error, misuse, abuse, or overdose ( acute or chronic) 
•  Publications describing lack of efficacy 
•  Publications describing off-label use with safety impact 
•  Publications describing unlisted interactions or new data on listed interactions 
•  Publications reporting pregnancy or drug exposure via parent events (regardless of outcome, 
even if a normal outcome) 
•  Publications describing medically important safety information in a special population (not in the 
target population) that is not described in the product information.

Adverse events of special interest - Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Macias Saint-Gerons D, Ibarz MT, Castro JL, Fores-Martos J, Tabares-Seisdedos R. 
Myopericarditis Associated with the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine (NVX-CoV2373): A 
Retrospective Analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports from VigiBase. Drugs Real World 
Outcomes. 2023 Jun;10(2):263-70. (6) 
The authors presented a retrospective analysis of myopericarditis, an AESI, associated with a protein 
sub-unit vaccine, NOV AV AX® (NVX-CoV2373), reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
global safety database and compared to the rates reported with other COVID- 1 9  vaccines. From 
3 1  703  998 ICSRs, there were 61 8 1 2  ICSRs of myopericarditis and 61 were reported for NOV AV AX 
vaccine. Out of 61  included cases, 45 reported pericarditis,  1 1  myocarditis, four myopericarditis and 
one both terms (myocarditis and pericarditis). Most of the cases were reported from Australia (82%). 
The median age of individuals was 35.5 years old, and most were males (38; 62.3%). Twenty-
four (24) reports (39.3%) were considered serious, none of them were fatal. The median induction 
period for myopericarditis from vaccination (after the most recent immunization) estimated from 
40 ICSRs, was three days. Increased disproportionality for myopericarditis was found for NVX­
CoV2373 (Reporting Odds Ratio  [ROR]  14.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]  1 1 .22-1 8.67) and mRNA 
vaccines: BNT1 62b2 (ROR 17. 1 5, 95% CI  1 6.88-1 7.42) and mRNA- 1 273 (ROR 6.92, 
95% CI 6. 77-7 .08). Higher values were found in males. Disproportionality for the NVX-Co V23 73 
vaccine was found in the age groups 1 8-44 and 45-65 years in both sexes, but with higher values in 
males. Chest pain was the most common co-reported event 43 (70.5%). The adenoviral vector-based 
vaccine Ad26.COV2.S showed slightly increased disproportionality (ROR  1 .83, 95% CI 1 .70- 1 .98), 
whereas no increased disproportionality was found for ChAdOxl  adenoviral vector-based vaccine. The 
authors concluded that new NVX-Co V23 73 vaccine shows an increased disproportionality for 
myopericarditis similar to mRNA vaccines (6). 
MAH Comment: Based on the study conducted by the authors suggesting an increased 
disproportionality with the protein sub-unit vaccines. However,  a greater risk of hospitalization and 
death has been observed in association with COVID-19 infection than with the vaccination.  This study 
also had several limitations.  The data source for the study was retrieved from spontaneous reports 
database from which no definitive causal associations can be drawn. Relevant information such as viral

testing for myocarditis was lacking from the reports. In  addition, the exact mechanism of action for 
vaccine-induced myopericarditis remains to be elucidated. More evidence from controlled studies is 
necessary. Myocarditis/ Pericarditis is already an important potential riskfor COVID-19 vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted). Please also refer Section 16.3 and Section 1 6.4 for details. 
Special population - Patients with kidney transplant receiving immunosuppressive therapy 
Nafar M, Mostafaloo N, Firouzan A, Poorrezagholi F, Samadian F, Dalili N, et al. Immunogenicity 
and Safety of SpikoGen, an Adjuvanted Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein, as a 
Heterologous Third Booster Dose in Kidney Transplant Patients: A Single-arm Clinical Trial. 
Clinical Therapeutics. 2022 Dec 1;44(12):1566-76. (7) 
The authors assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the SpikoGen® vaccine as a third booster dose in 
special patient population ( 43 patients undergoing kidney transplant receiving immunosuppressive 
therapy) at a referral center for kidney transplantation in Iran. The patients had received their primary 
vaccination based on an inactivated whole  virus platform (Sinopharm) one to three months earlier. 
SpikoGen is a subunit recombinant S protein vaccine combined with Advax-CpG55.2 TM adjuvant, a 
microcrystalline polysaccharide particle engineered from delta inulin. The most common local and 
systemic reported solicited AEs were injection site pain in 1 9  patients (44. 1 9%) and fatigue in 
1 0  (23.26%), which were largely mild and transient. No SAEs were reported (7). 
MAH Comment: In this article,  the authors performed a single-arm,  open-label, prospective clinical 
trial including 43 patients with SpikoGen (adjuvanted recombinant S protein trimer vaccine). The 
authors observed that a single booster dose of the vaccine given one to three months after primary 
vaccination with two doses of Sinopharm vaccine induced positive humoral and cellular immune 
responses in immunosuppressed patients undergoing renal transplant, thereby achieving S Ab levels 
predictive of protection.  While positive responses are observed, the number of transplant patients was 
relatively low and there was no control group. In  addition,  this was a single-center study. Further 
information would be needed from larger,  multicenter studies to extend these results.  Use in 
immunocompromised subjects is a missing information for COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted). Please refer Section 16.3 and Section 16.4 for details.

The authors presented findings from the systematic review and meta-analysis concerning pregnancy 
outcomes following COVID- 1 9  vaccination with BNT1 62b2, Moderna, ChAdOxl  and Janssen vaccines 
from multiple studies. No difference in maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes or AEs and no increased 
risks in pregnant women or neonates were found in vaccinated women compared to non-vaccinated. (8)

FINAL 
MAH Comment: Based on the systematic review of safety outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 
this article summarizes key aspects and outcomes due to COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. For 
a vast majority of the studies,  the reported side-effects in pregnant women were similar to the general 
population and no significant impact on the adverse maternal or fetal outcomes were observed with the 
vaccines.  The various studies and recommendations further affirm that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the 
risk of hospitalizations and deaths in pregnant women as in the nonpregnant population.  The authors 
highlight the importance of advice and reassurance on the safety ofCOVID-19 vaccinations in pregnant 
population for effective benefit-risk communication.  Use in pregnant women and while breastfeeding is 
a missing information for MAH COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). Please refer 
Section 16.3 and Section 1 6.4 for details. 
Tormen M, Taliento C, Salvioli S, Piccolotti I, Scutiero G, Cappadona R, et al. Effectiveness and 
safety of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women: A systematic review with meta-analysis. BJOG. 
2023 Mar;130(4):348-57. (9) 
The authors presented a systematic review and meta-analysis of pregnancy outcomes and risk of 
pregnancy related complications in COVID-1 9  vaccinated pregnant population with Pfizer, 
AstraZeneca, and Jansen vaccines (no protein-based vaccine included in the analysis) and a comparison 
to unvaccinated population. Administration of a COVID-1 9  vaccine during pregnancy resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in SARS-Co V-2 infection and COVID-1 9-related hospitalizations, but 
the certainty of evidence was very low. The effect appeared to be greater for both infection and 
hospitalizations when considering only fully vaccinated women, although the level of certainty was still 
very low. Conversely, the difference in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions related to COVID-1 9  did 
not reach statistical significance, likely due to the small number of total cases of both vaccinated and 
unvaccinated women. Nine (9) studies evaluated fetal complications occurring during pregnancy in 
vaccinated versus unvaccinated women. No significant differences were observed for the following 
outcomes: pregnancy loss, fetal abnormalities, small for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, 
preterm birth, stillbirth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, neonatal ICU admission and hypoxic­
ischemic encephalopathy between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. 
MAH comment: It was concluded that COVID-19 vaccination administered during pregnancy seems to 
reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization, with no significant effects on 
maternal-fetal complications (9). However,  the certainty of evidence was low as the data was identified 
from observational studies.  Use in pregnant women and while breastfeeding is a missing information for 
MAH COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). Please refer Section 16.3 and Section 1 6.4 for 
details. 
No articles on patients vaccinated with protein-based vaccines or COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) in pregnant women were identified.

1 2   OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS 
During the reporting interval this is the only PBRER prepared by the MAH for this product including 
periodic reports prepared by the contractual partner. 
1 3   LACK OF EFFICACY I N  CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS 
No new controlled clinical trials indicating a lack of efficacy of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted), in the authorized indications, relevant for the benefit-risk evaluation were identified during 
the reporting interval. 
1 4   LATE-BREAKING INFORMATION 
Since the DLP for this PBRER, the MAH has identified the following new information regarding 
potentially important safety and efficacy and/or effectiveness: 
One signal on allergic including anaphylactic reactions has been opened on 1 7  May 2023, validated on 
1 4  June 2023. On 26 June 2023, signal of allergic including anaphylactic reactions was confirmed as an 
identified risk. The weighted cumulative evidence was considered sufficient to support a causal 
association between COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) and allergic including anaphylactic 
reactions that should be reflected in the RSI. 
Regarding anaphylactic reactions, highest levels of certainty for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis 
(levels 1 and 2 of the Brighton Collaboration Case Definition (BCCD) [10]) were not reached for any 
case; however anaphylactic reactions could be expected after any vaccination. In addition, the pattern 
observed of allergic reactions reported after the use of COVID- 19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) 
(rash, urticaria, rash erythematous, pruritus, swelling face) supports the fact that the signal detected is 
judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action and moves to full evaluation and 
further characterize allergic including anaphylactic reactions. Further details regarding this  signal will be 
discussed in the next PBRER interval. 
1 5   OVERVIEW OF SIGNALS:  NEW, ONGOING, OR CLOSED 
There are no signals that were ongoing at the DLP or closed during the reporting interval. Therefore, 
Appendix 3 is not applicable.

Depending on the source screened for signal detection and product-specific criteria, the following 
signal detection methods are used to identify new drug-event combinations, or an increased 
reporting of an event or a group of events, requiring further evaluation: 
•  Qualitative: Manual medical review of ICSRs recorded in the GPV database, and review of 
aggregate data to detect any new relevant AEs or a change in nature, and/or increased severity of 
a known ADR, with a particular focus on increased trends in reporting, newly reported events, 
and medication errors, non-case literature review. 
•  Semi-quantitative: Manual review of aggregate data from internal databases (eg, PV or PC 
database) such as event counts and frequency or proportion thresholds, sorting, and 
cross-tabulations, based on thresholds, evaluation algorithms and medical judgment.

1 6   SIG NAL AND RISK EVALUATION 
1 6.1  SUMMARY OF SAFETY CONCERNS 
The definitions of important identified and potential risks and missing information in GYP Module V 
Revision 2 apply in the context of risk management planning. The EU RMP is judged based on 
risk-benefit impact and the need for further risk minimization activities and/or further evaluation as part 
of a PV plan. Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module VII is applicable for the purpose of risk 
classification in the PBRER. The definitions in GYP Module V are not used for the purpose of risk 
reclassification in the PBRER. For this reason, the lists of safety concerns reported in the PBRER, and 
the EU RMP may differ. Refer to Appendix 6. 1  for the list of safety concerns specific to the EU RMP. 
A summary of the safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) identified at the 
beginning of the reporting interval is presented in Table 6.

•  Results: From the review of the GPV safety database, one case ofmyocarditis was retrieved for 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) during the reference period. In addition, no 
increased 0/E ratio has been detected for myocarditis/pericarditis (Refer to Appendix 6.4.2 and 
Section 1 6.4). 
•  Discussion: One serious case report of myocarditis (II■■■■-•) was reported from 
consumer via - in an elderly patient of unknown gender two days after vaccination. An 
81 -year-old and unknown gender patient experienced positional dizziness and myocarditis 
two days after vaccination with COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted). At time of 
reporting, the outcome was not recovered. Further information on patient underlying disease 
condition, past medical and drug history, concomitant medications, description of the reported 
symptoms, complementary investigations and results excluding alternative etiologies for the 
reported event are needed to fully assess this case. Based upon the reported information, the role 
of the individual suspect vaccine cannot be assessed. This case was assessed as BCCD (17) 
level 4 for myocarditis. 
•  Conclusion: Based on medical review of cumulative data supported by 0/E analysis, no safety 
concern has been identified.

characterization of missing information. 
Use in pregnancy and while breast-feeding 
No case reports of use in pregnancy were reported. 
Two systematic review and meta-analysis were published in relation to pregnancy. One concerning 
pregnancy outcome following COVID-19 vaccination with BNTl 62b2, Moderna, ChAdOxl  and 
Janssen vaccines (8) and the second in relation to pregnancy outcome and risk of pregnancy related 
complications in COVID-1 9 vaccinated pregnant population that found no increased risks in pregnant 
women or neonates of vaccinated women compared to non-vaccinated, and no significant effects on 
maternal-fetal complications (9) (see Section 1 1). 
Use in immunocompromised subjects 
One literature article presented the use of a protein-based COVID-1 9  vaccine (SpikoGen) in patients 
undergoing kidney transplant receiving immunosuppressive therapy (7). The observed safety profile in 
this patient population was similar to the previously known safety profile of the vaccine and no SAEs 
reported (see Section 1 1).

This potential risk has not been described with any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from any other late 
phase Clinical Studies nor in animal models with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Historically, cellular immunopathology associated to either Th2 or inflammatory T cell 
responses has been observed after viral challenge in some animal models administered 
SARS-CoV-1  (murine, ferret and non-human primate models) or MERS-CoV (mice model) 
early-stage vaccine candidates (1 8) (1 9). No similar observations were reported for any of 
the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in animal models or in humans. 
This potential risk has been included based on these animal data with these related beta 
coronaviruses. Historically, disease enhancement in vaccinated children following infection 
with natural virus has been observed with an inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine

(20). Vaccine-associated disease enhancement in humans has been described for two 
investigational formalin inactivated vaccines; against Respiratory Syncytial Virus and 
measles, and one licensed vaccine, the tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine (21 )  (18). 
Two different mechanisms have been identified to trigger disease enhancement. 
•  Antibody Dependent Enhancement is the result of vaccine-elicited antibodies that do not 
effectively neutralize the virus because of low affinity, wrong specificity, or inadequate 
concentration. Virus-Ab complexes can gain entry to cells via Fe-receptor-mediated 
uptake and lead to a more severe disease. 
•  A second mechanism involves triggering of allergic inflammation, characterized by 
Th2 biased immune response over Th1 (1 8), (22) 
The molecular mechanism for this phenomenon, sometimes termed ADE, VAERD, or 
Immune Enhancement of viral infection, is also not fully understood. In the context of 
coronavirus infections, various factors have been suggested as potentially contributing to the 
phenomenon. These include the epitope targeted, the method of delivery of the antigen, the 
magnitude of the immune responses, the balance between binding and functional antibodies, 
the elicitation of antibodies with functional characteristics such as binding to particular 
Fe receptors, and the nature of the Th cell response (23), (24), (25), (1 8). 
A theoretical concern with coronavirus vaccines is VAED (1 8), (1 9), (22), (1 1). This is the 
potential {hypothetical) increased disease severity in naive vaccinees ( 1 1 )  upon exposure to 
wild-type virus (26). 
This disease enhancement of viral infection is also not fully understood. Mostly in the context 
of non-clinical beta coronavirus infections, various factors have been suggested as 
potentially contributing to the phenomenon. These include the epitope targeted, the method 
of delivery of the antigen, the magnitude of the immune responses, the balance between 
binding and functional antibodies, the elicitation of antibodies with functional characteristics 
such as binding to particular Fe receptors, and the nature of the Th cell response (23), (24), 
(25). Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not shown evidence of VAED disease 
after immunization (27). Available data for other COVID-1 9 vaccines from different platforms 
do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced disease (27), (28), (29), (30). 
However, considering limited long-term safety data and in the absence of effectiveness data, 
the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule out VAED including VAERD as a 
safety concern. Thus, it remains an important potential risk. 
No safety concern has been identified from postmarketing setting as of PBRER DLP. 
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease including VAERD is a theoretical safety concern 
based on the currently available information for COVID-19 vaccines. 
Within the Clinical Studies for CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 {B.1 .351), active surveillance {phone 
calls with the study participants) and passive surveillance {study participants instructed to 
contact the  site if the experience COVID-1 9-like illness symptoms or have a positive 
COVID-19 test from any other source) for COVID-1 9-like illness was implemented. 
For the VAT00008 phase Ill stage 1 and stage 2 efficacy study, a harm monitoring with 
regards to symptomatic and severe COVID-1 9 cases was implemented.

Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease including Vaccine-Associated

These provisions within the Clinical Studies allow detection of any evidence of VAED 
including VAERD caused by CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 {B.1 .351). 
No evidence of VAED including VAERD was found based on review of available data from 
clinical studies. 
•  Of note, in D614 containing vaccines {Monovalent) formulation and specifically in 
VAT00008 stage 1 ,  an increased number of Omicron symptomatic COVID-19 cases in 
the naive vaccine group compared to the naive placebo group was observed. When 
scrutinizing this observation, there was no increase in severe outcomes, hospitalization, 
or mortality in the naive vaccinees. The clinical presentation {intensity of symptoms as 
measured in three intensity grades, number of symptoms per omicron case and the 
duration of symptoms) was similar in the naive vaccine and placebo groups. No evidence 
of an increased viral load {naive vaccinees versus naive placebo recipients) was found. 
Most likely explanation for the observation is a lack of efficacy of the Monovalent D614 
formulation against Omicron {lower level of neutralizing antibodies for this variant, 
additionally a long period between administration of the two doses of the study vaccine in 
VAT00008 stage 1 and the start of the Omicron wave {approximately five months after 
study start). In VAT00008 stage 2, no increased number of Omicron cases in the vaccine 
group were reported as compared to the placebo group.  This was not seen neither in 
Booster formulations. 
In addition, VAED including VAERD might not apply to booster vaccine if referring to 
Brighton definition {VAED including VAERD risk would concern only SARS-CoV-2 
seronegative individuals or individuals with unknown serostatus and no previous COVID-19 
infection) (1 1 ). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Individuals with lower neutralizing antibodies titers or those with waning immunity (22), (1 1 ), 
(31 ). 
Preventability 
Impact on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product 
This risk remains unpredictable and may depend on the immune response of the patient 
(1 8), (32). Potential risk may be decreased with an efficacious vaccine generating an 
adequate immune response is expected to mitigate this theoretical risk. 
Clinical study participants are informed of this theoretical risk during the informed consent 
process. Occurrence of COVID-19 cases and especially severe COVID-19 cases are 
monitored in the Clinical Studies and in postmarketing setting. This will allow early detection 
of any evidence of VAED including VAERD. 
Available data for mRNA COVID-1 9  vaccines Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (28), (29), for 
an adenovirus-vectored vaccine {Janssen) (30) as well as for a protein adjuvanted vaccine 
(33) do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced disease. 
As VAED including VAERD is a theoretical {hypothetical) safety concern there is no 
deleterious impact on the benefit-risk balance anticipated for this product. 
Public health impact 
No public health impact is identified currently.

Table 8 - Important potential  risk:  Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
Potential risk 
Myocarditis  and  Pericarditis 
Potential mechanism 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Myocarditis is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence prior to COVID-1 9  vaccine 
pandemic of 1 6  per 1 00 000 persons in the general population. The true incidence may be 
higher, as signs and symptoms vary, and it therefore can be challenging to make the 
diagnosis. Viruses are the primary cause of myocarditis, including amongst others 
adeno- and enteroviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been 
associated with myocarditis as well, and multiple cases have been described since the 
outbreak of the COVID-1 9  pandemic (34). 
The majority of patients are young, healthy males (35). Based on systematic review, males 
are notably more likely to develop myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 
vaccination than females (85% versus 1 5%). The higher prevalence of this condition among 
males can be explained based on the role played by variations in hormone signaling. 
Testosterone has the ability to suppress anti-inflammatory immune cells while promoting a 
more aggressive Th 1 cell immunological response. Estrogen, on the other hand, inhibits 
pro-inflammatory T cells, resulting in a reduction in cell-mediated immune responses. 
However, further research is required to explore the exact phenomenon (36). 
Several mechanisms have been hypothesised to account for COVID-1 9 mRNA vaccine 
associated myocarditis including autoimmunity triggered by molecular mimicry (35), (36), 
immune-mediated pathology (37), pro-inflammatory cascade (38). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 
vaccines, mainly in males under the age of 40 years within 14 days after a second dose. 
However, cases have also been reported in older males, in females, and following other 
doses. There are limited data on the risk of myocarditis following third and subsequent 
booster doses. However, the risk after the third dose seems to be lower than following the 
second dose (39). 
The observed risk is highest in males 12 to 1 7  years of age. While some cases required 
intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that symptoms 
resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is not yet available 
about potential long-term sequelae (40), (41 ). 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after 
COVID-1 9  vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a booster dose 
of Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is observed at 1 -7 days 
(IRR 21 .08, 95% Cl 1 5.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 1 1 .29, 95% Cl 7.70, 16.57), 1 5-21 days 
(IRR 5.36, 95% Cl 3.24, 8.89) and 21-28 days (IRR 3.08, 95% Cl 1 .65, 5.75) following a 
positive test (37). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and 
post-authorization surveillance of NOVAVAX COVID-19 vaccine, which is manufactured 
using a protein/adjuvant platform and a different AS than the CoV2 pres dTM vaccine. 
Considering limited safety data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule out 
myocarditis and pericarditis as a safety concern. Thus, it is added as an important potential 
risk. 
No safety concern has been identified from postmarketing setting as of PBRER DLP.

Potential risk 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
Characterization of the risk 
No case of myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed in ongoing clinical studies with 
CoV2 preS dTM (B.1 .351) vaccine. However, based on potential risk from other COVID-1 9 
vaccines, participants of ongoing clinical studies with CoV2 pres dTM (B.1 .351) vaccine are 
advised to seek immediate medical attention and notify study site staff if symptoms 
compatible with myocarditis and pericarditis occur following vaccination. Participants with 
events of myocarditis and pericarditis will be discontinued from further vaccination and 
followed for subsequent visits as per the protocol for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy 
endpoints. 
The most important published cohort studies to date demonstrate that myocarditis is a very 
rare side effect after COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccination, with an incidence of approximately 
1-4 cases per 1 00 000 vaccinated persons (34). 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after COVID-1 9  
vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a booster dose of Pfizer 
BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is observed at 1 -7 days 
(IRR 21 .08, 95% Cl 1 5.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 1 1 .29, 95% Cl 7.70, 16.57), 1 5-21 days 
(IRR 5.36, 95% Cl 3.24, 8.89) and 21-28 days (IRR 3.08, 95% Cl 1 .65, 5.75) following a 
positive test (37). 
The observed risk is highest in males 12 to 1 7  years of age. While some cases required 
intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that symptoms 
resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is not yet available 
about potential long-term sequelae (40), (41 ). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and post­
authorization surveillance of the NOVAVAX COVID-19 vaccine, which is manufactured using 
a protein/adjuvant platform and a different AS than the CoV2 pres dTM vaccine (42). 
In the placebo-controlled safety dataset of NOVAVAX COVID-19 vaccine (participants 
12 years of age and older) with 30 058 subjects receiving active vaccine and 1 9  892 subjects 
receiving placebo, two cases of myocarditis were reported following exposure to NOVAVAX 
COVID-1 9  vaccine and one case was reported following exposure to placebo. In the 
post-crossover phase of studies, three cases of myocarditis were reported. The Sponsor 
assessed the causality as not related for the five cases occurring after exposure to 
COVID-1 9  vaccine with all cases attributed to alternative etiologies, including reasonable 
infectious and/or non-infectious causes. There were no cases of myocarditis and pericarditis 
assessed as related by the Sponsor. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine may be at higher 
risk (35), (36).

Public health impact 
As the mechanism is not fully understood, preventative measures cannot be defined at this

Balanced with the risk of death and illness seen with COVID-19 itself, the vaccine has a 
favorable risk-benefit balance. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are events which may be serious or non-serious and are 
generally mild but may be potentially life-threatening. Most vaccine-associated myocarditis 
events have been mild and self-limiting {37). Balanced with the risk of death and illness

Anticipated risk/consequence 
of the missing information 
Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from Clinical Studies (phase 11/111 and 
phase Ill). A pregnancy test is systematically being performed in these women before each 
study vaccine administration and the vaccine or placebo dose is not injected in case of a 
positive pregnancy test. 
Use of CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 (B.1 .351) in pregnancy and while breast-feeding is considered 
as missing information until sufficient evidence is available. 
Safety data with other vaccine manufactured with the same platform and safety data with 
other AS03 adjuvanted vaccines administered during pregnancy have shown no evidence of 
an increased  risk of adverse outcomes in the mother or child (43). 
A DART study has been conducted in rabbits. Results do not indicate any findings that could 
raise suspicion of a safety concern in human. There were no vaccine-related effects on 
mating performance or fertility in female rabbits, or on embryo-fetal (including teratogenicity) 
and early post-natal development of the offspring. 
From ongoing Clinical Studies (VAT00001 ,  VAT00002, and VAT00008) and due to exclusion 
criteria, only limited number of pregnancy exposures were reported. No safety concern was 
identified. 
No pregnancy exposure has been reported from postmarketing setting as of PBRER DLP. 
It is not yet known whether CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 (B.1 .351) could cause any fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman or if any detrimental effects could occur when 
administered in breast-feeding women. 
Use in pregnancy and while breast-feeding is a missing information for COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) and will be studied in VAT0001 2  (C-VIPER, sponsor Pregistry, 
LLC) with the objective to evaluate obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes among women 
vaccinated during pregnancy with a COVID-19 vaccine. 
In general, it is recognized that the anticipated risk and consequence of vaccination in 
pregnant and breast-feeding women is low and only considered for some live attenuated 
vaccines (44). 
Preliminary findings in pregnant persons who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines did not 
show obvious safety signals. However, more longitudinal follow-up, 
including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary 
to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes (45), (46).

No effectiveness evaluation is established for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) since there 
are no RMM beyond routine. 
1 7   BENEFIT EVALUATION 
1 7.1 
IMPORTANT BASELINE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS INFORMATION 
The approved indications for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted), is presented in Section 2. 
The mechanism of action consists of the induction of immune responses against the antigens contained 
in the vaccine. The S glycoprotein of SARS-Co V-2 associated with AS03 adjuvant stimulates 
neutralizing and other functional S-specific antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses directed 
against the S antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-1 9  (47). 
Epidemiology: 
Epidemiological data collected since the beginning of the pandemic have shown that individuals of any 
age can acquire infection of SARS-Co V-2, however, there is an uneven distribution of infections per 
defined age group. According to data published by the WHO, people aged 30 to 39 years have the 
highest amount of confirmed and probable cases, followed by 20 to 29, 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years age 
groups respectively. This age-based distribution, however, does not correlate across gender-based 
distribution, with infections occurring at similar rates between males and females (47). 
Globally, till 09 May 2023, there have been 766 029 927 confirmed cases of COVID-1 9, including 
6 928 795 deaths, reported to WHO ( 48). Although all regions have reported substantive numbers of 
cases, the greatest cumulative numbers of confirmed cases to date have been in Europe (>276 million 
cases), the Western Pacific (>203 million cases) and the Americas (>1 78 million cases) (48). 
Key risk factors for severe COVID-1 9  disease include but not limited to CVD, diabetes, chronic 
respiratory disease, COPD, hypertension, malignancies, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular 
disease and stroke, with higher risk of severity and mortality ranging 1 . 14 to 7 . 1  times higher in these 
risk groups (49). Older age (particularly �65 years) is a recognized risk factor for more severe 
COVID-1 9  disease and death, with populations aged 65 to 74 years at five times higher risk of 
hospitalization and 90 times higher risk of death than population aged 1 8  to 29 years old in the US (50). 
New and emerging variants are playing an important role in local and global epidemiology. 
Omicron has established itself as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage globally. In early 2022, a large 
number of Omicron-descendent sub-lineages emerged (BA. I ,  BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5), with ECDC 
categorizing these sub-lineages separately to better distinguish their relative impacts to the

epidemiological situation. Amongst these sub-lineages, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 consistently circulated in 
the EU/EBA until late 2022. The current epidemiological situation is hallmarked by a highly diverse 
landscape of co-circulating BA.2 and BA.5 descendent variants, which have different properties to their 
parental lineages and require individual assessment (5 1). 
Efficacy data/Immunogenicity data: 
Efficacy of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine has been inferred by immuno-bridging of 
immune responses to an authorized COVID-1 9  vaccine, for which VE has been established. 
The clinical immunogenicity of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .35 1 strain) vaccine given as a booster 
injection is being evaluated in two clinical studies: V AT000 13 (Study  1) in COVID-1 9  mRNA 
vaccine-primed participants and V AT00002 Cohort 2, Beta arm (Study 2) that included participants 
primed with various types of COVID-1 9  vaccines. 
Immunogenicity results from Study VAT0001 3  
This i s  a randomized, single-blinded multicenter investigator-initiated clinical study conducted in 
France, which evaluated the immune response induced by a booster dose of either 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine, or Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine or Sanofi 
investigational booster vaccine (protein-based adjuvanted COVID-1 9  vaccine, D614, 5 µg) in 
individuals previously vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine. The per-protocol 
analysis population included 2 1 7  participants 1 8  years of age and older primed with two doses of 
COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine three to seven months prior to receiving CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B. 1 .35 1 strain) vaccine (N = 67), COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine (N = 76) and Sanofi investigational 
booster D614 vaccine (N = 74). The mean age was 40.6 years (range 1 8  to 73 years). The mean duration 
between the second dose of the primary series and the booster dose was 1 74 days and was comparable 
across groups. 
Among this per-protocol population, samples from prior to vaccination and 28 days after booster of 
1 14 participants (54 from CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 [B. 1 .35 1 strain] vaccine and 60 from Pfizer 
COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine and 48 from Sanofi investigational booster D614 vaccine) were tested by 
Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies 
28 days after CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine or Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine 
booster in COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine-primed participants were compared. 
Superiority of GMT against Omicron BA. I was demonstrated for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B. 1 .35 1 strain) vaccine group in comparison with Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine group. 
Non-inferiority of seroresponse rate against Omicron BA. I and D614G strains for 
CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine compared to Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine was 
demonstrated with seroresponse rate defined as a four-fold or greater rise in serum neutralization titer 
28 days post-booster dose relative to pre-booster dose.

Across all variants tested, the levels of neutralizing Ab titers 28 days post-booster dose observed in 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine group were higher than in Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA 
vaccine group, with the GMT ratio between 1 .43 and 2.53 (52), (53), (54). 
Immunogenicity results from Study VAT00002 (Cohort 2. Beta arm) 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine given as a booster is being evaluated in an ongoing 
multicenter phase 3 clinical study in participants 1 8  years of age and older in Australia, France, 
Honduras, Spain, UK, and United States. Per-protocol analysis population included 6 1 5  participants who 
received CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .35 1 strain) vaccine 4 to 10 months after receiving primary 
vaccination with 2 doses of Pfizer COVID-1 9  mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) (n = 325) or 
Modema COVID-1 9  mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) (n = 93), AstraZeneca COVID-1 9  Vaccine 
(ChAdOxl -S [recombinant]) (n = 94), Sanofi investigational primary vaccine (protein-based adjuvanted 
COVID-1 9  vaccine, D614, 5 to  1 5  µg of antigen dose) (n = 72), or with one dose of Janssen COVID-1 9  
vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (n = 3 1). 
In per-protocol analysis population receiving Co V2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .35 1 strain) vaccine booster, 
the mean age of participants was 46.0 years (range  1 8  to 93 years); 435 (70.7%) were 1 8  to 55 years of 
age 1 80 (29.3%) were 56 years of age and older, 78 (12.7%) were 65 years of age and older. Among 
them, 47.0% were male, 53.0% were female, 67.6% were White, 1 1 .7% were Black or African 
American, 3.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 2.9% were Asian. 
Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring neutralizing Ab titers (1D50) against a pseudo virus 
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from a USA_ WAl /2020 isolate with the D614G mutation and 
B. 1 .351 variant using a SARS-CoV-2 Pseudo virus Neutralization Assay. 
A booster response to CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B. 1 .351 strain) vaccine was demonstrated regardless of 
the vaccine used for primary vaccination with the Geometric Mean Titers Ratio (GMTR [GMTR], fold 
increase) 14 days post-booster relative to pre-booster against B. 1 .351 strain ranging from 38.5 to 1 80, 
and from 1 4.5 to 148 for D614G strain (55).

INTEGRATED BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS FOR APPROVED 
INDICATIONS 
1 8.1  BENEFIT-RISK CONTEXT - MEDICAL NEED AND IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVES 
The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in 
December 201 9  caused an initial outbreak of severe respiratory illness in the local population. This 
outbreak rapidly escalated until on 20 January 2020 the WHO first declared the outbreak as a Public 
Health Emergency of International Concern until 1 1  March 2020, when the status was changed, and a 
pandemic was declared. 
Globally, till 09 May 2023, there have been 766 029 927 confirmed cases of COVID-1 9, including 
6 928 795 deaths, reported to WHO ( 48). Although all regions have reported substantive numbers of 
cases, the greatest cumulative numbers of confirmed cases to date have been in Europe (>276 million 
cases), the Western Pacific (>203 million cases) and the Americas (>1 78 million cases) (48). 
Geographical variations have been observed in the burden of disease at the country level, mostly due to 
differences in timing and stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented. Differences of 
practices in testing/reporting of cases and healthcare management for severe cases may have had an 
impact on the number ofreported cases globally (56). 
Coronavirus disease-201 9  symptoms may vary from mild to severe, with approximately 33% to 55% of 
known cases to be asymptomatic (varies by variant) (57), (58). The risk of transmission from an 
asymptomatic appears to be less than that from an individual with symptoms. Nevertheless, 
asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic individuals are less likely to isolate themselves from other people, 
and the extent to which transmission from such individuals contributes to the pandemic is uncertain. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) modelling study estimated that 59% of transmission

could be attributed to individuals without symptoms: 35% from pre-symptomatic individuals, and 
24% from those who remained asymptomatic (59). 
Symptoms appear on average four to five days after infection, though the usual range is between 
two to  1 4  days. Preliminary data shows the incubation period for Omicron to be 2.9 to 3.2 days (60). 
Most reported symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle ache, cough, and shortness of breath, which can 
progress to pneumonia. Mild acute disease tends to resolve within approximately two weeks, whereas 
severe cases can last 36 weeks. Longer term sequalae in some cases, otherwise known as "long-COVID" 
or "post-acute COVID syndrome", in which symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, myocarditis, and 
dyspnea can last for weeks or even months after the acute phase (61), (53). Older adults and people who 
have severe underlying medical conditions ( eg, heart/lung disease, diabetes, or conditions affecting the 
immune system, such as immunosuppression) have been observed to be at higher risk for developing 
more serious complications from COVID-1 9  (62). 
New and emerging variants are playing an important role in local and global epidemiology. As of 
September 2022, the only variant of concern (VOC) defined by WHO and ECDC is Omicron, with 
ECDC specifying four sub-lineages of Omicron; BA. I ,  BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 (53), (52). The Omicron 
variant has a substantial growth advantage, due in part to a combination of immune escape and intrinsic 
high transmissibility and has rapidly become the predominant strain worldwide (63). 
Multiple antivirals and therapeutic treatments that target severe COVID-1 9  have been authorized. The 
antiviral treatment, remdesivir, has been approved by both the FDA and European Commission (EC). 
The EC has also authorized other treatments: anakinra, regdanvimab, tocilizumab, baricitinib, 
casirivimab/imdevimab, tixagevimab/cilgavimab, sotrovimab and ritonavir. Most therapeutic options, 
however, are still in early stages ofresearch (64). 
Following the introduction of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in December 2020, vaccination is 
reducing burden of disease. The WHO has issued emergency use listing (EUL) for multiple COVID-1 9  
vaccines while in Europe, the EC has granted MA to different types of COVID-1 9  vaccines such mRNA 
vaccines, viral vector vaccines, recombinant protein vaccine and inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine from 
different manufacturers. However, waning of vaccine-induced protection is a growing concern with 
many studies reporting a decrease in vaccine effectiveness after six months (63), (65), (66). Antibody 
levels are demonstrated to decrease over time after the second dose of the COVID-1 9  vaccination, 
therefore, protection against the Beta variant is expected to provide good coverage against other 
circulating variants. 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) which is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to 
prevent COVID-1 9  in adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-1 9  
vaccine demonstrates positive results with a good safety profile (67), (68), (3).

1 8.2  BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS EVALUATION 
1 8.2.1  Methodology 
The current benefit-risk evaluation, pivotal studies, and all postmarketing data. New information that has 
become available during the reporting interval, including newly identified risks described in 
Section 1 6.4.2 and newly identified efficacy data described in Section 1 7  .2, has been assessed to 
determine whether it affects the previously established benefit-risk profile of COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) in the approved indication(s). 
A structured systematic approach was applied to COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) as a 
booster for active immunization to prevent COVID-1 9  in adults who have previously received an 
mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-1 9  vaccine based on literature articles including published 
epidemiological studies, labeling documents, sponsored and unsponsored clinical trials and 
postmarketing data in order to evaluate the benefit-risk profile  of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted). Results presented on benefits and risks sections were retrieved from the most up-to-date 
information regarding the clinical efficacy/effectiveness and safety of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted). 
The data presentations are based on a descriptive framework developed for benefit-risk decision-making 
in drug development and post-approval settings. The approach is meant to facilitate identification of 
critical issues regarding benefits and risks and improve transparency of the assumptions used by the 
MAH to evaluate the benefit-risk profile. 
The steps from the framework were used to define the main problem to be addressed, ie, the context in 
which a decision had to be made, to determine key benefits and key risk outcomes to construct a value 
tree, and to identify the data sources. 
The descriptive framework emphasizes relevant metrics to enable a comprehensive discussion of 
benefit-risk while providing complete transparency into the origin and format of the source data. Key 
benefits are defined by favorable effects that contribute importantly to the overall benefit-risk evaluation 
and that are important for the patient (clinically important, relevant, intense, or durable). The key risks 
are defined by unfavorable effects that contribute importantly to the overall benefit-risk evaluation, and 
not necessarily include all important risks described in Section 1 6. The selection was based on medical 
judgment ( clinically important risks because of their severity, frequency, duration, toxicity, 
irreversibility, or inability to be predicted or prevented). They may also include those that are considered 
for risk minimization activity beyond labeling. Key benefits and key risks of COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) were organized in a hierarchic manner to construct a "Value Tree". 
The data presentation consists of a descriptive benefit risk framework table and a "Value Tree" for the 
approved indications developed for benefit-risk decision-making in drug development and post-approval 
settings.

Evidence and Uncertainties 
Conclusions and Reasons 
COVID-1 9  is a life threatening and disabling disease with true 
unmet need for patients. Vaccine access varying by 
regions/countries. Coverage rates for at least one dose of 
vaccine vary from >90% in UAE, Portugal, and Brunei, to 
< 3% in Burundi, Haiti, and DRC (82). 
There is an unmet medical need for individuals to have access 
to a COVID-1 9 vaccine that confers protection against 
circulating variant strains. No authorized COVID-19 vaccine 
has yet demonstrated efficacy against Omicron variant. 
Benefit-risk assessment is driven by efficacy in non-naive 
population. 
Emergence of new variants with changes in transmissibility, 
severity, increasing the risk of reinfection and possible 
SARS-CoV-2 potential of becoming endemic and seasonal 
triggers the need for booster vaccination(s). 
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 
COVID-1 9, caused by SARS-CoV-2, protein-enveloped RNA 
virus. 
Globally, till 09 May 2023, there have been 766 029 927 
confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6 928 795 deaths, 
reported to WHO. (48). 
A fifth coronavirus wave declared mid-Nov 2021 followed by 
the emergence of a new variant (Omicron) that was first 
reported to WHO from South Africa (B.1 .1 .529). There have 
been subsequent peaks (both cases and hospitalizations) 
through to mid- May 2023 (69) due to emerging Omicron 
sub-lineages with higher transmissibility and immune escape 
( 13) ( 1 7). As of 09 May 2023, seven sub-lineages of Omicron 
have been classified as voes by the CDC; B.1 . 1 .529, BA. 1 ,  
BA. 1 . 1 ,  BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5) (70). 
As of today, it is estimated that 95% or more of the population 
in EU and US are non-naive for COVID-19 (vaccinated or with 
previous infection) (71 ). 
On the 05 May 2023, WHO chief declares end to COVID-19 as 
a global health emergency. The head of the UN WHO has 
declared "with great hope" an end to COVID-19 as a public 
health emergency, stressing that it does mean the disease is 
no longer a global threat (72). 
Evidence 
Most common clinical presentation includes fever, cough, 
anosmia and shortness of breath. Severity varies from mild 
symptoms to severe conditions that can lead to a fatal 
outcome and long-term sequelae. The mean SARS-CoV-2 
incubation period is estimated to be six days (73), and 
infectiousness is estimated to last for one-9.5 days (depending 
on the variant) (74). 25% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infections (75). Antibody persistence demonstrated up to 
eight months after COVID-19 infection and up to six months 
after the second mRNA vaccine dose (76). A study from Italy 
(77) showed that > 98% of infected subjects had antibodies up 
to nine months later. 
New emerging variants: 
Emergence of new variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, 
Omicron variants including XBB lineages) with changes in 
transmissibility, severity, and risk of reinfection: highly 
transmissible voes emerged and are spreading globally.

Evidence and  Uncertainties 
Conclusions and Reasons 
Some variants have become dominant strains within 
one-four months (78) (79) (80). 
Uncertainties 
There is some data indicating COVID-19 will become an 
endemic, with opportunistic infections and seasonal pie of 
burden. New variants are emerging at an unprecedented rate 
and are generating waves of infection out of season. Influential 
factors to determine seasonality are still unknown (81 ).

Table 1 6  - Benefit-Risk Assessment table - Current Treatment Options 
Evidence and Uncertainties 
Conclusions and Reasons 
Widespread vaccine deployment in many countries reduced 
burden of disease and burden on healthcare system (88). 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (Recombinant, Adjuvanted) has the 
potential of playing a key role as universal booster regardless 
of the COVID-1 9  vaccine use as primary vaccination in 
countries with high vaccine coverage and high seropositivity 
rates worldwide, as well as in countries with low vaccine 
coverage because of more simple handling conditions (no 
ultracold storage requirements). 
Current standard of care for patients acquiring serious 
COVID-1 9  is mainly supportive. 
As of 09 May 2023, 380 vaccine candidates have been 
reported around the world (348 in clinical development and 
32 in use) (83). 
Only three COVID-1 9  vaccines approved or authorized for 
emergency use by US FDA: Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-1 9  Vaccine), Spikevax (Moderna COVID-1 9  Vaccine), 
and NOVAVAX COVID-1 9  Vaccine. 
In addition to the above vaccines, COVID-1 9  Vaccine Valneva 
and VAXZEVRIA® (COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) are 
approved for use in Europe by the EMA. 
Non-vaccine pre-exposure prophylaxis: currently only 
one non-vaccine pre-exposure prophylaxis is approved by 
FDA under EUA. EVUSHELD® (tixagevimab co-packaged with 
cilgavimab) is for emergency use in those who are not 
currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have not had a known 
recent exposure, have moderate to severe immune 
compromise or vaccination with any available vaccine is not 
recommended. 
Post-exposure treatments: currently only one drug treatment 
for use in COVID-1 9  [Remdesivir] approved by FDA and 
14 treatments authorised for emergency use (EUA-FDA) (84). 
During this public health emergency [Ritonavir-boosted 
nirmatrelvir (PAXLOVID®), molnupiravir, and certain 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs received  EUA from the FDA for the 
treatment of COVID-19] CTAP (85).

Conclusions and Reasons 
Evidence and  Uncertainties 
Antivirals for COVID-19 should be used by people at risk for 
developing severe COVID-1 9  if recently tested positive for 
coronavirus, had mild to moderate symptoms for no more than 
five days and are not yet hospitalized. 
Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (PAXLOVID) (inhibiting an 
enzyme needed to process some viral proteins into their final, 
functional form) (in adults and pediatric patients 12 + and 
> 40kg). 
Remdesivir with/without Dexamethasone or in combination 
with Baricitinib (Cytokine inhibitor) with an FDA authorization 
(in adults and pediatric patients 1 2+ and > 40kg). For use 
when neither of the preferred therapies (above) are available 
or ttherapeutic management of hospitalized individuals with 
COVID-1 9. Recommended use of each therapeutic is based 
on the medical status of the patient, in patients who do not 
require supplemental oxygen but are at an increased risk of 
developing severe disease. 
Bebtelovimab:  Monoclonal Ab for treatment that retains activity 
against Omicron (in adults and pediatric patients aged 1 2+ and 
> 40kg). 
Molnupiravir introducing mutations into the viral genome during 
viral replication. Full course of treatment with molnupiravir 
could suppress the virus in less than 36 h (adults only) (87). 
Other therapies such as tocilizumab (Ab against Interleukin 6) 
used in patients (aged two years and older) receiving 
corticosteroid medicines and requiring supplemental oxygen or 
mechanical ventilation. Baricitinib (Olumiant) is authorised for 
emergency use as treatment in hospitalised pediatric and adult 
patients (aged two and above) requiring supplemental oxygen, 
mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Coronavirus disease-201 9  
convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies is authorised in patients with immunosuppressive 
disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment (84). 
Currently approved drugs by the FDA: 
ACTEMRA® (Tocilizumab) is approved for the treatment of 
COVID-1 9  in hospitalized adults who are receiving systemic 
corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive 
or IMV, or ECMO. 
VEKLURY® (Remdesivir) is approved for the treatment of 
COVID-1 9  in adults and pediatric patients (28 days of age and 
older and weighing at least three kilograms) who are: 
hospitalized, or not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate 
COVID-1 9  and are at high risk for progression to severe 
COVID-1 9, including hospitalization or death. 
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) is approved for the 
treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-1 9  in adults who are at

In the case of COVID-19 infection, the immune system can 
become hyperactive which may result in worsening of disease. 
Immune modulators can help suppress this hyperinflammation. 
KINERET® {anakinra) is authorized for the treatment of 
COVID-19 in hospitalized adults with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen {low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at 
risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure and likely to 
have an elevated plasma suPAR. 
OLUMIANT® {baricitinib) is approved for the treatment of 
COVID-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental

stratum. The first Co-primary immunogenicity endpoint was 
non-inferiority of the post-booster B.1 .351 titer to the 
prototype strain vaccine post-primary D614G titer. The 
GMT ratio was 1 .96, and the lower bound of the 98.3% Cl 
of 1 .96, exceeding the threshold for success of 0.67, thus 
the objective was met. The second Co-primary endpoint 
was superiority of the post-booster to pre-booster titer. The 
GMT ratio was 35.4, with a lower bound of 26.7, exceeding 
the threshold for success of two, thus the objective was 
met. 
•  Bivalent: The primary objectives were evaluated in Pfizer 
mRNA-primed younger adult (1 8-55 year) age stratum. The 
post-booster B.1 .351 and D614G titers were non-inferior to 
the prototype strain vaccine post-primary D614G titer (GMT 
ratio 1 .39 and 2.34, respectively). The lower bound of the 
98.3% Cl for each comparison exceeded the threshold for 
success of 0.67, thus non-inferiority was concluded. The 
second Co-primary endpoint was superiority of the 
post-booster B.1 .351 and D614G titer to corresponding 
pre-booster titer. The GMT ratio for B.1 .351 was 34.2 and 
for D614G was 14.4, each with a lower Cl bound exceeding 
the threshold for success of two, thus the objective was 
met. 
•  VAT013 Investigator-Sponsored Study: study was 
conducted to assess the immunogenicity and safety of 
three booster vaccine options: CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 
(D614), CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1 .351), and 
Pfizer/BioNTech. The results showed showed the higher 
immune response elicited by CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 
(B.1 .351 )  vaccine than that elicited by the CoV2 pres 
dTM-AS03 (D614) booster vaccine or the approved 
Pfizer/BioNTech booster vaccine across a range of 
variants, including D614G, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA. 1 ,

IRR, with the lower bound of the 95% Cl > 30%; modified Full 
Analysis Set post-dose two: all participants regardless of 
serostatus at baseline). Vaccine efficacy 72.5% (95% Cl: 49.5; 
86.0) for prevention of Omicron symptomatic COVID-1 9  
disease (all participants regardless of serostatus at baseline). 
Vaccine efficacy in the younger adult population (1 8-59 years): 
67.3% (49.7;79.3) for prevention of symptomatic COVID-1 9  
(87 cases i n  Placebo group vs. 2 9  i n  Vaccine group). Limited 
number of participants and cases in the older adult population 
precludes a definitive conclusion in this age group. Vaccine 
efficacy in the older adults (60+ years): -47.7% (-1668.0; 83.1) 
(two cases in Placebo group vs. three in Vaccine group). 
Uncertainty: 
Duration of the follow-up time (median follow-up of 
approximately three months) precludes evaluation of the 
durability of the efficacy. 
Non-clinical evidence: 
Growing body of evidence indicating that induction of Ab, 
particularly neutralizing Ab to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 
may be associated with protection against COVID-19 (89) (90) 
(91). 
Emerging variants: Need for broadened protection 
Using monovalent Beta vaccine as a booster (third dose) in 
primed NHPs (mRNA-primed study CoV2-07 _NHP and 
subunit-primed study CoV2-08_NHP), neutralizing Ab titers 
were detected at high levels in all animals against Alpha, Beta, 
Gamma, Delta, Mu, and Omicron BA. 1 .  
Duration of immunity: Moderate Ab decline during the first 
two to three months after primary immunization with the Beta 
monovalent and D614/Beta bivalent followed by stabilization in 
NHPs up to six months, high and robust S-specific memory 
B cells were detected in all animals (CoV2-06_NHP). In primed 
NHPs, the booster effect on D61 4  and variant neutralizing Ab 
titers was prolonged up to six months (in both mRNA- and 
subunit-primed macaques), and S-memory B cells responses 
were increased especially in the NHP with low responses after 
the primary vaccination (mRNA-primed study CoV2-07 _NHP 
and subunit-primed study CoV2-08_NHP).

Evidence and  Uncertainties 
No increased risk of thrombosis identified in the 
placebo-controlled VAT0000B study. 
•  Limited safety database to assess very rare events (eg, 
anaphylaxis) including those identified for other COVID-1 9  
vaccines i n  postmarketing setting (other platforms). 
AS03 adjuvanted vaccines Evidence 
•  Strongly characterized adjuvant (pandemic Influenza 
vaccines) 
•  Clinical data: acceptable safety profile - Consistent with 
Literature review. 
•  Higher reactogenicity compared to placebo with increase in 
general symptoms after AS03-adjuvanted flu vaccines 
compared to non-adjuvanted/placebo (92) (43). 
Baculovirus platform Evidence 
•  Strongly characterized protein manufacturing platform 
(Baculovirus) 23 million doses of recombinant flu vaccines 
distributed in adults up to June 2022 with no safety 
concern. 
Other COVID-1 9  vaccine Evidence: 
Other COVID-1 9  AS03 adjuvanted vaccines demonstrated an 
acceptable safety profile (93), (94). 
Uncertainties 
•  Effects with any new antigen/adjuvant association: potential 
Immune Mediated Diseases including risk of Narcolepsy 
derived from the use of Adjuvanted PANDEMRIX® vaccine 
(AH1 N1  pdm09 - AS03 GSK) 
•  Limited safety data in pregnant and breast-feeding women, 
in immunocompromised subjects, in frail subjects with 
unstable health conditions and co-morbidities (eg, COPD, 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, CVD), in subjects 
with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. 
•  Long term safety 
Conclusions and Reasons 
Extensive AS03-adjuvanted flu vaccines and Baculovirus 
platform experiences in clinical and postmarketing setting with 
no safety concern. 
Similar profile of SAE, AESI, MME, unsolicited AE between 
the vaccine and  placebo groups observed in both participants 
with and without a high-risk medical condition. 
From postmarketing safety data up to PBRER DLP 
09 May 2023 and with more than 1 .6 million doses 
administered: 
•  A signal on Allergic including anaphylactic reactions has 
been opened on 1 7  May 2023 (after PBRER DLP). 
•  No other safety concern has been identified (and in 
particular concerning VAED including VAERD, increased 
risk of thrombosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia, narcolepsy or other AESls) 
Extensive exposure of elderly patients in the UK with more 
than 99% of doses administered in 60 years of age and older 
without any safety concern by age group (below 70 years old 
and above 70 years old). 
Risk management includes early reinforced postmarketing 
surveillance. 
•  Safety in immunocompromised patients is part of 
phase 11/111 Supplemental Cohorts (VAT00002) and  Ill 
(VAT0000B) and of VAT00027 booster effects with 
autoimmune treatments in participants with poor response 
to initial COVID-1 9 Vaccine (sponsored by the NIAID). 
Enrollment in this trial is ongoing. 
•  VAT00028 Safety and lmmunogenicity of a dose of the 
Sanofi-GSK monovalent (B.1 .351) CoV2 pres dTM-AS03 
COVID-1 9  vaccine in kidney transplant recipients with a 
persistently low SARS-CoV-2 Ab titer (sponsored by the 
NIAID). Enrollment in this trial is ongoing. 
•  Long term safety including AESls will be monitored during 
pivotal Clinical Studies follow-up and in PASS. 
Proposed Risk Management Strategy considered adequate to 
document the risk management system set-up for the 
COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) and to ensure a 
safe use of the vaccine in real-life setting.

Available data as of today for COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) including immunogenicity 
and safety data in individuals 1 8  years of age and older from V AT00002 supplemental cohorts 2 
(monovalent B. 1 .351 and bivalent B.1 .35 1/06 1 4  booster), efficacy and safety data from V AT00008 
Stage 2 with bivalent primary vaccination in individuals 1 8  through 59 years (limited sample size and 
number of COVID-1 9  cases did not allow to demonstrate efficacy in older age group) supported by 
V AT000 1 3  clinical study where the level of neutralizing Ab titers were high and greater than the 
approved Pfizer/BioNTech booster vaccine containing D614 strain and by VAT00008 booster extension 
(monovalent B. 1 .351 formulation) allow to conclude a positive Benefit/Risk of a COVID-1 9  vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted) in individuals 1 8  years of age and older. The anticipated benefits that may be 
afforded outweigh the potential risks associated with COVID-1 9  vaccine (adjuvanted, recombinant) as 
booster given in adults from 1 8  years and older. 
Postmarketing safety data up to PBRER DLP with more than 1 .6 million doses administered in 
postmarketing setting are supportive of this conclusion. 
1 9   CONCLUSIONS AN D ACTIONS 
Based on the evaluation of the cumulative safety data and the benefit-risk analysis during the reporting 
interval, the benefit-risk balance of COVID-1 9  vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) in the approved 
indication remains positive in the currently approved conditions of use.

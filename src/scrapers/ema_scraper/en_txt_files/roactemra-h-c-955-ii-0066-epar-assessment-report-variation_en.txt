2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanised anti-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the 
interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R, thereby 
inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling.  
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 6/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Interleukin 6 (IL-6), the ligand of IL-6R, is a cytokine produced by a wide variety of cells in the human body. 
Its normal role is primarily to regulate haematopoiesis, to stimulate immune responses, and to mediate 
acute phase reactions. Consequently, excessive production of IL-6 can be implicated in the pathogenesis of 
several diseases involved with these functions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple myeloma and 
Castleman’s  Disease.  IL-6  exerts  its  biological  effects  through  both  the  membrane  bound  IL-6  receptor 
(mIL-6R),  and  the  soluble  form  of  the  receptor  (sIL-6R).  TCZ  binds  specifically  to  both  soluble  and 
membrane-bound  IL-6  receptors  (sIL-6R  and  mIL-6R),  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  sIL-6R  and 
mIL-6R-mediated signaling. TCZ has been shown to inhibit the biological activities of IL-6 in vitro and in vivo 
and to suppress the development of arthritis and C-reactive protein synthesis in a collagen induced arthritis 
model in cynomolgus monkey. 
TCZ  is  available  in  2  different  pharmaceutical  forms  to  allow  either  administration  by  intravenous  (IV) 
infusion or by subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
In  the  European  Union  (EU)  both  pharmaceutical  forms  of  TCZ  are  approved,  in  combination  with 
methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA, in adults not previously treated 
with MTX and for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
have  either  responded  inadequately  to,  or  who  were  intolerant  to,  previous  therapy  with  one  or  more 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.  
In  these  patients,  TCZ  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  MTX  or  where  continued 
treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
The recommended dose for IV administration is 8 mg/kg TCZ every 4 weeks (q4w). 
For SC administration, the recommended dose is 162 mg once every week (qw). 
The IV formulation of TCZ is also approved in the EU, at the recommended dose, for the treatment of active 
systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (sJIA)  in  patients  2  years  of  age  and  older,  who  have  responded 
inadequately  to  previous  therapy  with  NSAIDs  and  systemic  corticosteroids.  RoActemra  can  be  given  as 
monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX or where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination 
with MTX. 
Also, RoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of 
age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. RoActemra can be given as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
Background on disease 
Giant  cell  arteritis  (GCA  or  temporal  arteritis)  is  a  systemic  inflammatory  vasculitis  of  medium-  and 
large-size  arteries.  The  inflammatory  process  typically  involves  the  extracranial  branches  of  the  carotid 
arteries, but also affects the aorta, aortic arch and its branches. The disease typically occurs in the White 
population and in individuals older than 50 years of age and was once considered primarily a cranial disease 
with new onset headaches regarded as the prototypical symptom. However non-cranial manifestations such 
as polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) symptoms and limb claudication are other important features. Giant cell 
arteritis  can  manifest  with  ischemic  events  due  to  vessel  occlusion,  most  typically  central  retinal  artery 
occlusion  or  anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  which  both  lead  to  irreversible  vision  loss,  and  less 
frequently,  subclavian  artery  occlusion  leading  to  symptomatic  ischemic  issues  affecting  the  upper 
extremities.  Ischemic  events  are  most  frequent  early  in  the  disease  course  and  often  occur  before  the 
initiation  of  treatment.  Less  well  characterized  are  the  long-term  effects  of  GCA,  which  include  aortic 
aneurysm.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and are typically administered in the form of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, although some physicians use pulsed intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in patients 
presenting with visual loss. Although glucocorticoids are highly effective at inducing remission of systemic 
inflammation and preventing acute damage (e.g., blindness), this comes with a high toxicity burden, with 
approximately 80% of patients suffering GC-related adverse clinical events at 10-year follow-up (Proven et 
al. 2003). In addition, GC are not as effective at maintaining remission, with many patients (up to 50%) 
experiencing relapse or flare-up of symptoms during reduction or discontinuation of glucocorticoids (Proven 
et al. 2003). Other agents, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (MTX), infliximab, and 
etanercept, have shown conflicting or no evidence of benefit in the treatment of GCA. In spite of the paucity 
of evidence, MTX is used inconsistently as standard of care for glucocorticoid-sparing in relapsing patients. 
More recently, limited efficacy in the treatment of GCA has been demonstrated with the use of combination 
treatment with abatacept and prednisone (Langford et al. 2015). 
Development aspects 
Data to support the efficacy of tocilizumab (also known as RO4877533 and TCZ) in adult patients with giant 
cell arteritis (GCA or temporal arteritis) are provided from the pivotal Phase III trial (Study WA28119; 
GiACTA). Study WA28119 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ plus glucocorticoid treatment 
compared to treatment with glucocorticoids alone in new-onset and relapsing patients with GCA, as well as 
to evaluate the safety profile of TCZ treatment in this patient population. The study includes a 52-week 
blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 2), with a total study duration of 156 
weeks. Clinical conduct of Part 1 of the study is complete and the primary analysis has been conducted. The 
Part 2, open-label extension/long-term follow-up, is currently ongoing. The purpose of the open-label 
extension/long-term follow-up is to describe the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 
weeks of therapy with TCZ in GCA, to explore the rate of relapse and the requirement for TCZ therapy 
beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the potential long-term steroid-sparing effect with TCZ.  
Additionally, in order to support data from Study WA28119, efficacy data are provided from the publication 
by Villiger et al. 2016 which describes a Phase II investigator-initiated study (further referred to as Study 
ML25676 throughout this report) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ + glucocorticoid 
treatment compared to glucocorticoid treatment alone in the induction and maintenance of disease 
remission in patients with new-onset and relapsing GCA. 
In addition to the safety data derived from the above studies, the safety database is enriched by pooled 
long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, referred to as LTE 
All-exposure RA population. 
Scientific Advice was sought from the CHMP.

Study WA28119 includes a 52-week blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 
2), with a total study duration of 156 weeks. Clinical conduct of Part 1 of the study is complete and the 
primary analysis has been conducted. At the time of the Part 1 clinical cut-off date, 11 April 2016, 88 
patients had at least 100 weeks of follow up in Part 2 of the study. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
GCA study and Concentration-time-profile 
The PK/PD behaviour of TCZ has been previously characterized extensively in various populations, most 
notably in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
PK and PD data for this new patient population derives mainly from a single Phase III clinical study of TCZ 
administered SC to Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) patients (WA28119). 
Only data from Part 1 of the study is presented. Part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and will be presented 
separately. The final CSR will be submitted in Q1 2019. 
Comparisons were made between the two dosing regimens and to findings in the RA population. 
Additionally, a population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed to describe the PK characteristics of TCZ 
in patients with GCA following multiple SC administrations of TCZ and to investigate the potential effect of 
selected covariates on the PK parameters.  
Study WA28119 – PK results 
A secondary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen in patients with GCA. During the 52-week 
double-blind period of the study (Part 1), study drug (TCZ or placebo) was supplied in 1-mL, ready-to-use, 
single-use PFS, each delivering either 162 mg (0.9 mL) of TCZ solution or matching placebo (SC 
administration).  
For assessment of serum TCZ concentrations, IL-6, and sIL-6R levels, pre-dose samples were collected in all 
patients at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 52. A sample was also drawn at early withdrawal and 
Week 8 follow-up (except IL-6). 
In addition, approximately 35 patients participated in a pharmacokinetic substudy. In these patients, 
additional PK samples for assessment of serum TCZ concentrations were drawn at 24, 48, 72 96, and 120 or 
144 hours following the first dose and following dose at Week 16, and pre-dose at Weeks 17 and 18.  
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 11/117 
 
  
  
 
Table 1 - Schedule of Assessments for Pharmacokinetic Substudy 
In total, the data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated 
with TCZ. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks. 
Mean pre-dose TCZ concentrations increased with repeated dosing from baseline to Week 16 and appeared 
to reach steady state thereafter (Figure below). An approximate 6-fold and 2-fold accumulation in mean TCZ 
Ctrough at steady state was observed for patients in the QW and Q2W groups, respectively. Based on 
observed data for all patients, the steady-state Ctrough values were 67.93±34.40 µg/mL and 12.22±10.02 
µg/mL in the SC QW group and Q2W group, respectively. The large increase in exposure between QW dosing 
and Q2W dosing is consistent with the known effect of concentration-dependent elimination of TCZ. The 
nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ is believed to represent a target-mediated clearance process due to 
the binding to soluble and membrane bound IL-6R receptors.

Study Population  
Mean (range) weight and body surface area of the patients in this study was 70.3 kg (46.4 to 124 kg) and 
1.76 m2 (1.34 to 2.25 m2), respectively. Mean (range) age was 69.4 years (51 to 91 years). The dataset 
contained the data from 37 (24.8%) male and 112 (75.2%) female patients; 100 (67.1%) patients received 
TCZ QW doses and 49 (32.9%) of patients received TCZ Q2W doses. The majority of patients were 
Caucasians (96.0%) and non-Hispanic (94.6%). Most of the doses (76.8%) were injected to the abdominal 
wall, with 19.2% of doses injected to the thigh, and 4% injected to the arm. 
To assess whether there was an exposure body-weight effect, a scatter plot of observed Ctrough at Week 52 
versus body weight was displayed resulting from study WA28119:  
There was a positive trend for higher exposure in patients with lower body weight. The associated Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient (R) was −0.504 and -0.404 for the QW and Q2W regimens, respectively, which 
indicates a moderate inverse correlation between Ctrough and body weight. 
The relationship between exposure and body weight as well as other body size parameters (such as body 
surface area) following SC administration of TCZ is discussed further in the popPK results. 
To evaluate whether there was a difference in exposure between responders versus non-responders, the 
average Ctrough at Week 52 was compared: In the TCZ QW group, the mean±SD TCZ concentrations at 
Week 52 in responders vs. non-responders were 69.2±35 µg/mL and 64.9±33.5 µg/mL, respectively. In the 
TCZ Q2W group, the mean ± SD TCZ concentrations were 13.3±10.4 µg/mL and 9.0±8.4 µg/mL, 
respectively. There was a slight but consistent trend, notably in the Q2W regimen, toward higher Ctrough 
values in responders compared with non-responders; however, the differences were small considering the 
variability in the data.

Page 13/117 
 
  
  
 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD of TCZ was characterized by assessing two mechanistic markers of activity: soluble interleukin-6 
receptor (sIL-6R) and interleukin-6 (IL6) levels and two markers of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP) 
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).  
The time course of markers of TCZ mechanism-related activity (IL-6 and sIL-6R) and PD markers of 
inflammation (CRP and ESR) were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. However, 
there was a trend for a slightly higher increase (sIL-6R) or reductions (IL-6) in the PD parameters following 
QW regimen, consistent with higher Ctrough. CRP and ESR levels in both TCZ groups were markedly reduced 
relative to placebo with no notable difference between the dosed groups. 
sIL-6R 
The profiles of pre-dose serum sIL-6R concentrations over nominal time are displayed in the Figure below: 
Figure 2 - Mean ± SD soluble IL-6R Levels by Visit (TCZ QW, Q2W, PBO + 26 Week, PBO + 52 Week - Study 
WA28119) 
Levels of sIL-6R steadily increased after the first dose, reaching a plateau around Week 16. At Week 52, the 
sIL-6R levels (mean ± SD) were higher by 29% in the TCZ QW group (600.5±217.5 ng/mL) as compared to 
the TCZ Q2W group (464.3±153.6 ng/mL). The sIL-6R responses to TCZ treatment in both regimens are 
comparable to the mean levels in RA patients at steady state (Week 24) who received the same dose 
regimens (599±180.1 ng/mL for TCZ QW in study WA22762 and 449±217.8 ng/mL for TCZ Q2W in study 
NA25220). Levels of sIL-6R in the placebo groups during the 52 weeks of study essentially remained 
unchanged from baseline. 
IL-6 
The mean ± SD pre-dose levels of IL-6 increased rapidly to 125.86±158.64 pg/mL one week after the first 
dose in the TCZ QW group, and subsequently plateaued to 65.99±84.92 pg/mL by Week 52 (Figure below). 
Similarly, the mean IL-6 levels in the TCZ Q2W group increased rapidly one week after the first dose 
(142.72±356.67 pg/mL), and then decreased to 42.62±47.87 pg/mL at Week 2, corresponding with 
decreased TCZ concentration at the end of the first dosing interval. Mean IL-6 levels in TCA Q2W group 
subsequently increased to 66.20±47.11 pg/mL at Week 3 and plateaued out until Week 52 (52.70±33.10 
pg/mL). At Week 52, the IL-6 levels were higher (25%) in the TCZ QW group compared to the TCZ Q2W

group. Levels of IL-6 in the placebo groups during the 52 weeks of study essentially remained unchanged 
from baseline. 
Figure 3 - Mean ± SD IL-6 Concentrations by Visit (TCZ QW, Q2W, PBO + 26 Week, PBO + 52 Week - Study 
WA28119) 
The mean values of CRP and ESR (see Figures below) decreased rapidly in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W 
groups, and remained low throughout the study. 
Mean ± SD levels of CRP at Week 52 were 1.42±4.30 and 0.83±1.60 mg/L for the QW and Q2W regimens, 
respectively. Mean ± SD levels of ESR at Week 52 were 4.84±4.04 and 7.06±6.79 mm/h for the QW and 
Q2W regimens, respectively. CRP and ESR levels at baseline for all patients were close to the upper end of 
the normal range (8 mg/L) in healthy individuals. This is in contrast to the baseline acute phase reactants 
observed in RA patients, in which the majority had elevated CRP and ESR at baseline, and could be due to the 
fact that the GCA patients were already receiving high dose glucocorticoids at study entry, which suppresses 
the acute phase reactants. During the 52 weeks of study, the mean CRP and ESR levels in the placebo groups 
essentially remained unchanged relative to their baseline levels.

Immunogenicity results  
Pre-dose TCZ concentrations were evaluated for the 4 patients who were negative for ADAs at baseline but 
developed positive post-baseline anti-TCZ antibodies following initiation of treatment: 1 in the TCZ QW 
(1.1%) and 3 in the TCZ Q2W (6.5%) group. All ADAs were transient, and each occurred only at a single time 
point over the 52 week dosing period. As shown in the Figure below, patient 10221 in the QW group and 
patient 10862 in the Q2W group did not show any trend for decreased TCZ concentration at Week 24 and 32 
when their ADA test showed positive results and concentrations were similar to or at the high end of 
observed values among all patients on this regimen. In contrast, patients 10227 and 10628 (both in the TCZ 
Q2W group) showed a transient decrease at Week 24 when their ADA test showed positive results and had 
observed concentration-time courses which were in the lower range of all exposures in the group. None of 
the patients, who developed treatment-induced ADA, experienced any anaphylaxis, serious and/or clinically 
significant hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, or withdrew due to lack of efficacy.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK Modelling and Analysis 
The data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated with TCZ 
over 52 weeks. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks. 
A two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption (following SC administration) and parallel linear 
and Michaelis-Menten (non-linear) eliminations was previously developed for adult RA patients (Model 317). 
The compartmental models were parameterized in terms of CL(s) and volume(s) of distribution, Q, Vp, 
Vmax, the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM), Ka, and Fsc. Fsc was fixed to the value obtained from adult RA 
patients, since there was no IV data available for GCA patients. Inter-subject variability was incorporated on 
linear CL, Q, Vc, Vp, and Ka.

The final population PK parameter estimates for GCA patients (Model 107) and predicted covariate effects 
are listed in the Tables below. All structural and covariate effect parameters were estimated precisely (RSE 
5% - 22%). The RSE values of the random effect variance parameters were in the range of 17% - 27%, with 
the exception of the random effect on the peripheral volume that was poorly estimated. 
Shrinkage of the random effects was low to moderate (2% - 27%) with the exception of the random effect 
on the peripheral volume (with shrinkage of 48.9%).

Based on prior knowledge from the previous population PK analysis for adult RA patients, the population PK 
model contained the following covariates: body weight on linear CL, inter-compartmental CL (Q), and 
volume of distribution of the central (Vc) and peripheral (Vp) compartments; age on absorption rate 
constant (Ka); thigh injection site on SC bioavailability (Fsc); HDL on CL; serum albumin and total protein on 
Vc and Vp; and creatinine CL on maximum elimination rate (Vmax). This model was the starting point of the 
analysis. The model was evaluated and refined using the data collected from GCA patients (Study 
WA28119).  
The significant covariates identified for GCA patients were: body weight on linear CL, Q, Vc, and Vp; age on 
Ka, and injection in the thigh on Fsc. The data set included relatively narrow range of ages (51 to 91 years), 
which leads to a high relative standard error estimated for the age effect on Ka. Therefore, age effect on Ka 
was fixed to be equal to the value in the adult RA model. 
Other covariates previously identified for adult RA patients were: HDL on CL; serum albumin and total 
protein on Vc and Vp, and creatinine CL on Vmax. These covariates were tested in the current model for GCA 
patients; none of them were significant, and they were removed from the model. Additionally, the presence 
of ADA was not found to influence the PK of TCZ. 
Body weight is the main covariate which has an appreciable impact on the PK of TCZ, and the relationships 
of the individual PK parameters with body weight are shown in the Figure below.

Figure 7 - Relationships of the individual PK parameters with body weight 
Renal impairment is not anticipated to impact the PK of TCZ and as anticipated creatinine CL was not 
identified as a significant covariate in the model. Based on the slightly older population with this disease 
one-third of the patients in the trial had moderate renal impairment; no significant impact on TCZ exposure 
was noted in these patients. 
Covariate effects identified in adult RA patients were reevaluated and non-significant effects were removed. 
Additional covariate effects were tested and discarded as they did not improve the fit. Distributions of the 
random effects for patients with and without detected ADAs were compared and the effects of ADAs were 
tested as time-dependent covariates on linear and Michaelis- Menten clearances. 
Predicted individual exposure parameters at steady-state are summarized in the Table below. Steady-state 
Cmean value for the QW regimen (71.3 μg/mL) was about 4.4 times higher than for the Q2W regimen (16.2 
μg/mL), Cmax value for the QW regimen (73.0 μg/mL) were 3.8 times higher than for the Q2W regimen 
(19.3 μg/mL), while Ctrough values for the QW regimen (68.1 μg/mL) was 6.1 times higher than for the 
Q2W regimen (11.1 μg/mL).

Exposure efficacy analysis 
Exposure-efficacy relationship of TCZ in GCA patients was described by exposure tertiles (week 52) and 
graphical analyses for PD and efficacy marker sIL-6R, CRP, and ESR as well for some secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints (cumulative glucocorticoid dose and annualized relapse rate up to Week 52). 
The distribution of Ctrough values reached by week 52 is depicted in the Figure below.

Figure 8 - Distribution of Ctrough values reached by week 52 
sIL-6R levels increased with time and with increasing exposure; CRP and ESR decreased with time and with 
increasing exposure and remained at low levels in all exposure categories; the biggest difference in the PD 
markers noted between the 1st tertile and upper two tertiles; the between-subject variability observed in 
sIL-6R, CRP and ESR levels decreased slightly with increasing exposure. 
Tertile analysis showed that primary efficacy endpoints (sustained remission up to Week 52) were similar in 
all TCZ exposure categories with a small, but not statistically significant trend of increasing efficacy with 
exposure.

Tertile analysis regarding secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (cumulative glucocorticoid dose and 
annualized relapse rate up to Week 52) showed overall similarity in all TCZ exposure categories. 
Cumulative Glucocorticoid Dose versus 
Annualized relapse rates: 
Exposure Category 
To characterize the relationship between TCZ exposure and time to first flare in patients with GCA a Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model was used. The following covariates were included in the analysis: 
demography (body weight, age, gender, smoking status [yes, no]), baseline disease status [new onset, 
relapsed] and TCZ exposure (treatment effect [TCZ, placebo], Cave8). The individual predicted average 
concentration up to Week 8 from treatment start (Cave8) was used as a surrogate for exposure. 
A nonlinear Emax model was applied to characterize the effect of concentration (Cave8). The Cox 
proportional-hazards analysis identified TCZ exposure and gender as the only two covariates which were 
significant predictors for the risk of flare.  
Risk of flare for males was ~3 times lower compared to females (HR = 0.320). The reference for the effect 
of TCZ exposure is Cave8=3.346 μg/mL (=EC50 value).

Figure 9 - Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to First Flare by Exposure (Tertile of Cave8) 
Results showed that patients in the QW group achieved a range of exposures which provided the maximal 
possible benefit. Patients in the 1st tertile in the Q2W group were at a higher risk for an earlier time to flare. 
Gender was also identified as a statistically significant predictor for the risk of flare with females identified as 
being at a higher risk. This finding may be influenced by the fact that 75% of the study participants were 
female due to a higher prevalence of GCA in females. No other prognostic factors had a significant effect on 
the risk of flare in GCA patients. 
Exposure safety analysis 
Graphical analyses to describe the exposure-safety relationships for SC administration of TCZ in patients 
with GCA were provided. 
Consistent with the previous body of data in RA, there was no apparent association of TCZ concentrations or 
exposure with the occurrence of any SAEs, or AEs in system organ class (SOC) “Infections and Infestations” 
or SOC "Gastrointestinal disorders". 
The only detected signal was a slightly higher percentage of Grade 3+ AEs in the QW treatment arm (14%, 
9%, and 2% for SAEs, II AEs, and GI AEs respectively versus 8.2%, 6.1%, and 0% for the respective AEs in 
the Q2W treatment arm), but the number of events were too low to make any conclusions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 24/117 
 
  
  
 
 
There was a trend of greater decline of hematology parameters (white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) 
with increasing exposure, which reached a plateau at higher exposure levels for white blood cell and 
neutrophil counts. 
White blood cells 
Neutrophils 
Platelets 
There was no association of TCZ concentrations with the occurrence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. 
The following safety laboratory parameters were investigated: white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, 
platelet counts, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, serum albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. 
Platelet counts time course was similar for all tertiles. Most biochemistry parameters (total bilirubin, ALT, 
AST, total protein, and total cholesterol) did not change during treatment. Small increases in serum albumin 
and LDL-cholesterol in the TCZ treatment groups were not associated with exposure. The increase in serum 
albumin over time was not dependent on TCZ exposure, and the albumin levels stayed below the upper limit 
of normal value for all exposure categories. Slight increases of LDL-cholesterol in the TCZ treatment groups 
appeared to have some dependence on TCZ exposure. However an examination of median changes from 
baseline (increase) in the three tertiles (0.27, 0.68 and 0.445 mg/dL, respectively) did not support this. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD of TCZ in GCA patients were assessed based on Part 1 of Phase III Study WA28119. 149 patients 
received 162 mg of TCZ SC QW (N=100) or Q2W (N=49). Limited information on Part 2 of Study WA28119 
is included in the submission; the final report is awaited and will be provided by Q1 2019. A phase II study 
(ML25676) was conducted where TCZ has been administered intravenously. Results will be provided for 
further analyses regarding PK characterization and comparison with RA patients. Analyses integrating IV PK 
results should in particular focus on a more precise description of clearance and bioavailability. 
Comparison of PK and PD outcomes in the GCA population relative to RA  
Data from both RA and GCA populations were fitted using the same structural model which was a 
two-compartment PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination with first-order absorption 
for SC administration. The model for TCZ PK in RA was the starting point for the GCA population. 
In both populations, the QW regimen resulted in nearly complete target saturation at steady-state during 
the entire dosing interval. The contribution of nonlinear CL to total CL was small at this dose. 
In both populations, the target-mediated elimination pathway was not saturated during the entire dosing 
interval for the Q2W regimen which led to high total CL and high fluctuation of CL over dosing interval. The 
nonlinear CL led to a more than dose-proportional increase in steady state concentration for the QW regimen 
compared to the Q2W regimen. 
In both populations, the PK parameters of TCZ following SC administration were not time-dependent as TCZ 
exposure was stable after achieving steady state. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 25/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
TCZ steady-state Ctrough values in GCA patients were 67.9±34.4 µg/mL and 12.2±10 µg/mL in the SC QW 
and Q2W group, respectively. Both mean steady state levels are slightly higher than observed in RA patients 
applying the same dose regimen (45 µg/mL and 5.9 µg/mL, respectively in RA patients). 
Accumulation was much higher in the QW regimen which is plausible. CHMP agreed that the large increase 
in exposure between QW dosing and Q2W dosing is consistent with the known non-linear PK behaviour of 
TCZ. 
BW influence on Ctrough exposure levels in GCA patients revealed a trend of higher Ctrough levels in lighter 
patients which is consistent with the use of a flat dose and with previous observations in RA patients. 
However, this impact was notably higher compared to RA patients. As the body weight ranges are 
comparative among both patient groups, body weight cannot be considered as reason for this notable 
difference in exposure between RA and GCA patients. The slightly higher levels observed in responder vs 
non-responder is not large enough to explain possible differences between GCA and RA. 
Estimate of linear CL in GCA patients was slightly lower (approximately 30%) than in the RA population 
resulting in a higher exposure. This led to differences in the estimated half-life of TCZ and time to steady 
state in the two populations For example, the effective half-life at steady-state ranged from 12.1 to 13.0 
days for the QW regimen in RA relative to 17.6 to 18.5 days for the same dose in GCA. After multiple dosing 
with the QW regimen, steady-state for AUC and Ctrough was achieved after the 12th injection in the RA 
population relative to the 16th injection in GCA. 
In conclusion, a difference between the two populations was seen both on linear apparent CL and on the 
effect of body weight on linear apparent CL (see figure below). GCA patients appear to have a lower linear 
apparent CL than RA; the reason for the difference is unknown. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 26/117 
 
  
  
The resultant impact of differences in linear apparent CL and KM in the two models results in a 50% 
difference between the predicted steady state exposures in the two populations. These differences are 
clearly stated in the SmPC Section 5.2 accordingly. These differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK 
differences are not accompanied by marked differences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is 
unknown. 
Age might be a potential factor considering that in the study WA28119 in patients were about 15 years older 
than the previous RA studies, in this study the mean (range) age was 69.4 years (51 to 91 years). But none 
of the POP-PK models applied so far identified age as a significant variable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 27/117 
 
  
  
 
 
Despite the difference in PK, the post-dose sIL-6R levels were similar in the two populations indicating 
similarity in the contribution of the target mediated clearance in the two populations. 
The sIL-6R responses to both QW and Q2W TCZ regimens are comparable to the mean levels in the same 
regimens in RA patients. In the RA study WA22762, sIL-6R levels in the QW regimen at steady state (Week 
24) were 648 ± 189.3 ng/mL [n = 557] compared to 600.53 ± 217.52 ng/mL in the GCA study, WA28119. 
Similarly for the Q2W regimen sIL-6R levels were 449 ± 217.8 ng/mL [n = 346] in the RA study NA25220 
relative to 464.30 ± 153.64 ng/mL in the GCA study, WA28119. Thus, post-dose sIL-6R levels were similar 
indicating similarity in the contribution of the target mediated CL in the two populations. Time courses of the 
PD biomarkers sIL-6R and IL-6 are in line with the expectations. 
ADA incidence was low in both groups (1-6 %) which is comparable to the incidence previously observed in 
other populations. Given the low number of patients with positive treatment emerging ADA and the mixed 
influence on PK, CHMP concluded that there is no consistent impact of positive post-baseline anti-TCZ 
antibodies on PK, safety or efficacy of TCZ.

Population PK analysis 
The data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated with TCZ 
over 52 weeks. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks. 
A 2-compartmental model that was previously established for RA patients (Model 317) was selected as basis 
to describe the PK of TCZ following multiple SC administration in GCA patients.  
Typical PK parameters have been estimated (Model 107) and are in the range of typical values for a 
monoclonal antibody (CL: 0.16 L/day, Vc: 4.09 L, Vp: 3.37 L).  
The significant covariates identified for GCA patients were: body weight on linear CL, Q, Vc, and Vp; age on 
Ka, and injection in the thigh on Fsc. The data set included relatively narrow range of ages (51 to 91 years), 
which leads to a high relative standard error estimated for the age effect on Ka. Therefore, age effect on Ka 
was fixed to be equal to the value in the adult RA model.  
The parameter estimates were also in a good agreement with the prior model except for the parameter KM 
that was estimated to be higher for GCA patients (0.705 μg/mL in the current analysis versus 0.343 μg/mL 
estimated for adult RA patients). As indicated above, GCA patients appear to have a lower linear apparent 
clearance compared to RA patients. 
Post hoc simulation of Ctrough exposure showed comparable mean concentration time profiles over 52 
weeks compared to the observed values, which was also demonstrated by prognostic and VPC plots.  
Body weight is the main covariate which has an appreciable impact on the PK of TCZ (Cl, V).  
This impact was notably higher compared to RA patients. CL and Vc for patients weighting 48.6 kg (2.5th 
percentile of the weight distribution in the dataset) decreased respectively by 34% and 22% compared to a 
70 kg patient. CL and Vc for patients weighting 102 kg (97.5th percentile of the weight distribution in the 
dataset) increased respectively by 54% and 29% compared to a 70 kg patient. 
As the body weight ranges are comparative among both patient groups, body weight cannot be considered 
as reason for this notable difference in exposure between RA and GCA patients. The slightly higher levels 
observed in responder vs non-responder is not large enough to explain possible differences between GCA 
and RA. 
Exposure-response analysis 
Results showed that patients in the QW group achieved a range of exposures which provided the maximal 
possible benefit.  
Tertile analysis showed that primary efficacy endpoints (sustained remission up to Week 52) were similar in 
all TCZ exposure categories with a small, but not statistically significant trend of increasing efficacy with 
exposure. 
Patients in the 1st tertile in the Q2W group were at a higher risk for an earlier time to flare. Gender was also 
identified as a statistically significant predictor for the risk of flare with females identified as being at a higher 
risk. Risk of flare for males was ~3 times lower compared to females (HR = 0.320). The generalizability and 
the clinical significance of this gender effect are unknown and were further explored. Response rate 
difference between the placebo (PBO 26 wk) and treatment groups (TCZ Q2W) are essentially the same (the 
difference is 38.8% for female and 31.3% for male patients).  
The reference for the effect of TCZ exposure is Cave8=3.346 μg/mL (=EC50 value). This finding may be 
influenced by the fact that 75% of the study participants were female due to a higher prevalence of GCA in 
females. No other prognostic factors had a significant effect on the risk of flare in GCA patients.  
Data analysis showed the trend that about one third (lowest exposure tertile) of the patients in the Q2W 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 29/117 
 
  
  
treatment group would gain benefit due to a higher exposure (Ctrough at week 52). Given that the weekly 
regimen is envisaged, this is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
No clear exposure-safety relationship could be detected. There was a trend of greater decline of 
haematology parameters (white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) with increasing exposure, which 
reached a plateau at higher exposure levels for white blood cell and neutrophil counts. There was no 
association of TCZ concentrations with the occurrence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  
Given that there is a higher exposure in GCA patients compared to RA patients and comparatively low 
patient numbers, exposure-safety relationships were discussed including the neutrophil loss rate.  Higher 
exposure in the GCA population did not lead to clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes relative to 
the RA population.  
Interactions 
IL-6 is known to suppress the expression levels of the mRNAs that code for drug metabolizing enzymes 
(cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]). This fact known from the literature had been confirmed by in-vitro 
studies, and the effect was particularly pronounced regarding to CYP3A4. TCZ was able to block this effect 
of Il-6 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. When the function of IL-6 is inhibited in such patients by the 
administration of TCZ, CYP expression levels may rise above pre-dosing levels and the serum concentrations 
of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by CYPs may decrease. This has been shown in RA patients 
using simvastatin as probe molecule. In a study in RA patients levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were 
decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab. Oral glucocorticoids (OGC) 
(methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) are metabolized by this CYP3A4 so plasma OGC level can decrease 
much faster than planned. The increased elimination carries the risk of decreased efficacy of OGC when it is 
co-administered with TCZ in the OCG taper period. There is also the risk of glucocorticoid withdrawal 
syndrome. As the issue is not specific for GCA and also relevant of other approved indications such as RA and 
sJIA, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone have been added to the list of interacting drugs in Section 4.5 
with an added warning of GC withdrawal syndrome. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data submitted is considered acceptable by CHMP to support the use of 
tocilizumab in patients with GCA. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were conducted.  
The rationale for the TCZ doses to be investigated in Study WA28119 was based on the 31 case reports of 
GCA patients who had been dosed with the approved RA doses of TCZ (4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg IV every 4 
weeks [Q4W]) at the time of study start; 29 patients had received 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (in some cases 
the starting dose was 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks), and 2 patients had received 4 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (Seitz 
et al. 2011; Christidis et al. 2011; Beyer et al. 2011; Salvarani et al. 2012; Unizony et al. 2012; Roche data 
on file). Patients responded well, and no treatment-limiting safety concerns were noted. In the patients 
dosed with TCZ 8 mg/kg, PD data showed a decrease in post-dose CRP and an increase in post-dose IL-6 
levels. The normalization of CRP was sustained throughout the 4-week dosing interval, suggesting adequate 
blockade of IL-6 signaling in GCA with TCZ 8 mg/kg IV Q4W. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 30/117 
 
  
  
For Study WA28119, the SC route of administration, via pre-filled syringe (PFS), was chosen over the IV 
route as it provides a more convenient route of administration in the elderly population of patients with GCA 
(e.g., home administration, no requirement for venous access). The two SC doses selected in the Phase III 
RA SC program (162 mg QW and Q2W) were assessed. The 162 mg SC QW dose had PD profiles comparable 
to those for the approved 8 mg/kg Q4W IV dose in RA patients (Study MRA227JP; Study NP22623) and was 
expected to also show a similar PK/PD profile in GCA patients. This dose was expected to deliver optimized 
efficacy and safety in GCA. The dose of 162 mg SC Q2W is a lower SC dose option that was expected to 
deliver an acceptable safety profile with reasonable efficacy. 
The CHMP considered acceptable that no dose response studies were conducted since two TCZ doses were 
studied in phase III WAS28119 study. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
A Phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in subjects with giant cell arteritis (WA28119) 
Methods 
Study participants 
The target population for this study were adult patients with GCA who have active disease (signs and 
symptoms and elevated ESR) within the 6 weeks prior to baseline visit. New-onset and relapsed/refractory 
GCA patients are eligible. New-onset and relapsing disease were defined as follows: 
•  New-onset: diagnosis of active GCA within 6 weeks of baseline visit (defined as the presence of 
clinical signs and symptoms and ESR ≥  30 mm/hour or CRP ≥  1 mg/dL; elevations in ESR and CRP 
were not required if the patient had a positive temporal artery biopsy within the 6 weeks prior to 
baseline). 
•  Relapsing: diagnosis of GCA > 6 weeks before baseline visit, previous treatment with ≥  40 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 consecutive weeks at any time, and active GCA within 6 
weeks of baseline visit (defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and ESR ≥  30 
mm/hour or CRP ≥  1 mg/dL; elevations in ESR and CRP were not required if the patient had a 
positive temporal artery biopsy within the 6 weeks prior to baseline). This included patients who had 
previously achieved remission and subsequently flared and those who had not achieved remission 
since the diagnosis of disease (i.e., refractory patients). 
A screening period of 6 weeks was defined for the purpose of distinguishing between new-onset and 
relapsing patients. 
Key inclusion criteria 
Diagnosis of GCA classified according to the following criteria: 
•  Age ≥  50 years 
•  History of ESR ≥  50 mm/hour* 
* If historic ESR was unavailable, a history of CRP ≥  2.45 mg/dL was required. The CRP value was derived 
from published data both from GCA and RA patients (Hayreh et al. 1997; Wolfe 1997; Paulus et al. 1999).

Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio into four groups: 
• 
• 
Placebo SC weekly (QW) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 26 wk; n = 50) 
Placebo SC QW + 52-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 52 wk; n = 51) 
•  162 mg TCZ SC QW + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ QW; n = 100) 
•  162 mg TCZ SC every other week (Q2W) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ Q2W; n = 50) 
During the screening period, patients could receive glucocorticoids for the treatment of GCA at the discretion 
of the investigator. By the end of the screening period, patients had to switch to the Sponsor-provided 
prednisone in order to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper. At the time of the baseline visit, all 
patients had to switch from the glucocorticoid prescribed by the investigator to prednisone provided by the 
Sponsor. The baseline daily dose had to be within the range of prednisone 20─60 mg/day. 
Calcium, bisphosphonates, vitamin D, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering agents, and MTX are allowed as 
concomitant medication. 
Objectives 
Primary efficacy objective: To evaluate the efficacy of TCZ compared to placebo, in combination with a 
26-week prednisone taper regimen, in patients with GCA, as measured by the proportion of patients in 
sustained remission at Week 52 following induction and adherence to the protocol-defined prednisone taper 
regimen. 
• 
Induction of remission had to occur within 12 weeks of randomization. 
•  Sustained remission was defined as absence of flare following induction of remission up to the 
52-week time point. 
o  Flare was determined by the investigator and defined as the recurrence of signs or 
symptoms of GCA and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥  30 mm/h attributable to 
GCA. 
• 
Patients had to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper regimen 
Remission was defined as the absence of flare (as defined above) and normalisation of C-reactive protein 
(CRP < 1 mg/dL). 
Key secondary objectives of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of TCZ in combination with a 26-week 
prednisone taper regimen versus placebo in combination with the 52-week prednisone taper regimen, in 
patients with GCA, as measured by the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 following 
induction and adherence to the protocol-defined prednisone taper regimen. 
Other secondary objectives:  
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen versus both 
placebo groups in patients with GCA, as measured by the following: 
–  Time to GCA disease flare after clinical remission 
–  Cumulative glucocorticoid dose 
To assess the effect on patient’s quality of life of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone 
taper regimen versus both placebo groups in patients with GCA, based on the patient-reported

outcome (PRO) as measured by SF-36 and patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity on a 
visual analogue scale (VAS). 
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TCZ in combination with a 26-week 
prednisone taper regimen in patients with GCA. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the 
TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen compared with the placebo + 52-week 
prednisone taper. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• 
Time to first GCA disease flare after clinical remission (up to 52 weeks) 
•  Summary of total cumulative prednisone dose over 52 weeks 
•  Change from baseline in SF-36 (Physical and Mental Component Summaries) at 52 weeks 
•  Change from baseline in PGA of disease activity (VAS scale) at 52 weeks 
Sample size 
Assuming that the absolute difference in the proportion of patients who are in sustained remission at 52 
weeks is equal to 40% (assuming ρTCZ = 70% versus ρ6-mCS = 30%), a sample size of 100 patients in the 
162qw TCZ group and 50 patients in both the 162 q2w TCZ group and placebo group (in combination with 
the 26-week prednisone taper group) will ensure at least 90% power to detect a difference in the proportion 
of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 for both TCZ arms versus placebo at an alpha level of 0.01 
(2-sided). In addition, 50 patients will also be included in the 52-week prednisone taper group. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:2:1 ratio to treatment arms and randomization was stratified by 
the baseline prednisone dose (> 30 mg/day, ≤  30 mg/day prednisone).  
The proportion of relapsing patients (GCA diagnosed > 6 weeks before the baseline visit and previous 
treatment with ≥  40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥  2 consecutive weeks at any time) enrolled was 
preferentially limited to 70% to ensure some enrolment of new-onset patients (GCA diagnosed within 6 
weeks of the baseline visit) but could be increased depending on the rate of enrolment of relapsing versus 
new-onset patients. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blinded during the first 52 weeks and to maintain the blinding of treatment allocation 
a Dual Assessor Approach was utilized. As knowledge of certain laboratory data could result in inadvertent 
unblinding of a patient’s treatment, in order to maintain the blind, a Laboratory Assessor was assigned who 
was responsible for the overall clinical management of the patient outside of their GCA. ESR was measured 
at each visit and all site personnel, including the Clinical Assessor, were blinded to the results with the 
exception of the Laboratory Assessor and the Study Coordinator/ESR technician. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 34/117 
 
  
  
Unblinding by the Sponsor occurred at the time of the Week 52 primary analysis. Per regulatory 
requirements, study treatment was to be unblinded for all unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) that 
were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Statistical methods 
There were 5 pre-defined analysis sets: the all-patients set (all randomized patients), the ITT set 
(randomized patients with at least one dose of TCZ/placebo), the PK-evaluable set, the safety set and the 
escape population (ITT patients who entered escape therapy). The primary analysis population for all 
efficacy analyses was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 
The primary endpoint, proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52, was analysed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for the ITT population, adjusting for starting prednisone dose (≤  30 
mg/day, > 30 mg/day), which was the stratification factor applied at randomization. Non-responder 
imputation was used for missing data. A tipping point analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the 
primary analysis. A second sensitivity analysis was performed for disease diagnosis based on signs and 
symptoms of disease only in order to mitigate against the possibility of biasing the results because of the 
known PD effect of TCZ on acute phase reactants. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the 
TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen compared with the placebo + 52- week 
prednisone taper group. In order to determine non-inferiority, a two-sided 99.5% CI was constructed for the 
difference in proportions between each TCZ group and the placebo + 52-week taper group on the basis of 
the normal approximation and adjusted for the prednisone starting dose and compared to a non-inferiority 
margin of -22.5% which was defined in the SAP but not in the study protocol. The non-inferiority margin was 
derived based on one study (Seror et al. 2014) with a prednisone response rate of 71% (95% CI: 52%-86%) 
and a placebo response rate of 0% (95% CI: 0%-7%). Further 8 studies were listed but not used for the 
derivation of the non-inferiority margin as they used a different taper regimen or were retrospective, 
observational studies. Post-hoc analyses of the difference in proportions was performed using an extended 
Mantel-Haenszel test based on the normal approximation and was adjusted for the baseline stratification 
factor of prednisone starting dose (≤  30 mg/day, > 30 mg/day). 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested at a 1% overall significance level (α = 0.01) against 
two-sided alternatives. The SAP specified two independent hierarchies for the TCZ dose families for which 
the overall alpha level was equally divided (i.e., α = 0.5% per family) in order to correct the type I error rate 
for multiple comparisons. Both hierarchies tested the treatment comparisons in a fixed sequential order as 
specified in the SAP to further control for multiplicity.  
Hierarchy 1 tested the primary endpoint for superiority of TCZ QW + 26-week prednisone taper versus 
placebo + 26-week prednisone taper, followed by the key secondary endpoint for non-inferiority of TCZ QW 
+ 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 52-week prednisone taper.  
Hierarchy 2 tested the primary endpoint for superiority of TCZ Q2W + 26-week prednisone taper versus 
placebo + 26-week prednisone taper, followed by the key secondary endpoint for non-inferiority of TCZ Q2W 
+ 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 52-week prednisone taper. 
All other secondary and exploratory endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity. 
However, the key secondary endpoint was also tested for superiority after non-inferiority was met using a 
Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test based on the normal approximation adjusted for the baseline stratification 
factor of prednisone starting dose (≤  30 mg/day, > 30 mg/day). 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 35/117 
 
  
  
Each of the TCZ treatment groups was compared with both placebo groups for further secondary endpoints. 
Time to disease flare was analysed using time-to-event methods based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator and 
Cox PH model with stratification factor starting prednisone dose. The cumulative prednisone dose to Week 
52 (including all taper prednisone [both open-label and blinded taper], escape therapy and commercial 
prednisone) was analysed using a van Elteren test stratified by starting prednisone dose on the basis of the 
assumption that total cumulative prednisone dose was non-normally distributed or on an appropriate 
parametric analysis stratifying by starting prednisone dose in case of normal distribution.  
Change from baseline in PGA and SF-36 were analysed using a maximum likelihood-based repeated 
measures model with categorical effects for treatment, baseline prednisone dose (≤  30 mg/day, > 30 
mg/day), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline prednisone dose-by-visit interaction, as well as 
the continuous covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction. An unstructured variance 
structure was used to model the within-patient errors. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to 
estimate denominator degrees of freedom. A contrast between treatments at the Week 52 timepoint was the 
comparison of interest.

Participant flow 
Figure 10 - Overview of patient disposition 
During the 52-week double-blind period (Part 1), a total of 41 patients were withdrawn prematurely from 
blinded study treatment (TCZ/placebo/prednisone): 9 patients (18%) in the PBO + 26 wk group, 5 patients

(10%) in the PBO + 52 wk group, 18 patients (18%) in the TCZ QW group and 9 patients (18%) in the TCZ 
Q2W group. The most common reason for premature discontinuation from study treatment was withdrawal 
because of an AE (see also below). Nine patients in the TCZ QW group, 7 patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 6 
patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 5 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group were withdrawn from study 
treatment due to non-safety reasons.

First patient screened: 15 July 2013 
First patient randomized: 22 July 2013 
Clinical cut-off for the analysis: 11 April 2016 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (dated 20 July 2012) was amended three times: on 19 October 2012 (Version 2), on 08 
February 2013 (Version 3), on 07 June 2013 in Canada only (Version 4 Canada), and on 22 January 2014 
(Version 4 globally, and Version 5 in Canada). 
Version 2: dated, 19 October 2012. The most significant changes are related to: 
• 
• 
The inclusion criteria relating to the requirement for a history of ESR ≥  50 mm/hour and active 
disease according to an ESR ≥  30 mm/hour were clarified. The exclusion criteria were revised to 
exclude only major ischemic events unrelated to GCA and a new exclusion criterion added to exclude 
patients who received pulsed methylprednisolone within 6 weeks of baseline 
The protocol was aligned with the Sponsor’s memorandum on “Implementing IgE Assay for TCZ 
Immunogenicity Testing” and immunogenicity testing for patients who discontinued treatment with 
TCZ was added 
Version 3: dated, 08 February 2013. The most significant changes are related to: 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017

• 
• 
Following FDA feedback the definition of relapsing patients was updated to include those with active 
disease despite at least 2 consecutive weeks of treatment with ≥  40 mg/day prednisone (or 
equivalent) at any time. 
Following FDA feedback the key secondary endpoint defining a comparison of the proportion of 
patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups versus the placebo group with 
52-week prednisone taper was added. 
Version 4: dated, 22 January 2014. The most significant changes are related to: 
• 
To better reflect clinical practice where CRP is replacing ESR in several health centres, the 
requirement for a CRP ≥  2.45 mg/dL for patients where a historical ESR value was unavailable was 
added. 
•  Removal of the requirement of ESR ≥  30 mm/hour or CRP ≥  1 mg/dL to confirm active disease in 
patients with a positive temporal artery biopsy within 6 weeks of baseline. 
•  Definition of flare was modified to allow the clinical assessor to consider an elevated ESR as disease 
flare in the absence of GCA signs and symptoms if, in their opinion, it was attributable to GCA.

Protocol deviations  
Table 5 - Violations of protocol eligibility criteria 
Five patients deviated from the protocol-defined prednisone taper. Patients who deviated from the protocol 
defined prednisone taper were placed back onto the prednisone dose they should have been receiving. If the 
patient was ahead of the predefined taper schedule then an extra wallet was inserted into the taper schedule 
via the IVRS and if the patient was behind the predefined taper schedule they were placed onto the correct 
prednisone taper wallet.

Prednisone dose at baseline 
Median prednisone dose at baseline (start of the open-label prednisone taper period) was 35 mg/day (range 
5-60 mg) in the TCZ Q2W group and 30 mg/day (range 5-60 mg) in all other treatment groups. Per protocol, 
patients were to be receiving a starting prednisone dose of 20-60 mg/day at baseline (i.e., 
60/50/40/35/30/25 or 20 mg/day). However, 5 patients received the incorrect dose of prednisone at 
baseline in error. These prednisone starting dose errors were captured as major protocol deviations, 
although the patients were permitted to remain in the study (see above). Two further patients had 
prednisone dosing medication errors at baseline one in the PBO + 52 wk group and one patient in the TCZ 
QW group. These prednisone medication errors were not captured as protocol violations.  
All but one of the patients with incorrect prednisone starting doses experienced remission post-baseline.  
Analysis of prednisone starting dose by incremental categories (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 mg) showed that 
the percentage of patients on each prednisone starting dose category was balanced between each of the 
treatment groups. 
Concomitant treatment for GCA 
Concomitant treatments for GCA (other than blinded study treatment) as determined by the investigator 
were reported for 67% of patients in the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W groups, 78% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk 
group and 71% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. Steroids (including low-dose glucocorticoid treatment) 
were the most commonly reported concomitant treatments for GCA. 
Antimetabolites (methotrexate) were received by 11% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 10% of patients in 
the TCZ Q2W group, 16% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 18% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk 
group. 
Salicylates (aspirin) were taken by 18% of patients in the TCZ QW, TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 wk groups and 
16% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group while analgesics (mainly paracetamol) were taken by 3% of 
patients in the TCZ QW group, 14% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 16% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk 
group and 12% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 251 patients randomized into the study (100 patients to the TCZ QW group, 50 patients to the TCZ 
Q2W group, 50 patients to the PBO + 26 wk group and 51 patients to the PBO + 52 wk group), 250 patients 
received the treatment to which they were assigned. One patient (255730/11341) who was randomized to 
the TCZ Q2W group withdrew the same day they were randomized and did not receive any study treatment. 
This patient was excluded from the safety and intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy analysis populations

Significance level for primary endpoints: 0.005 
Superiority of both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups compared to placebo when combined with a 
26-week prednisone taper was demonstrated with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of 
patients achieving sustained remission at Week 52, following induction and adherence to the 
protocol-defined prednisone taper. 
A tipping point analysis was performed where escape patients and patients with GCA flare prior to 
withdrawal were classed as non-responders. All other withdrawals (2 in PBO group, 14 in TCZ QW, 5 in TCZ 
Q2W) were subsequently classed as either non-responder or responder and change in the primary endpoint 
was investigated. No tipping point was observed with increasing number of withdrawals classed as 
responders. 
A post-hoc analysis of the individual criteria of the composite endpoint of sustained remission was 
performed. In this analysis, the percentage of patients meeting each individual criterion for not achieving 
sustained remission was determined. Results showed that higher proportions of patients flared and 
subsequently received treatment with escape prednisone in the placebo groups compared to the TCZ 
groups.

Table 11 - Summary of components of sustained remission (ITT population) 
Evaluation of signs and symptoms present at the time of first GCA flare showed that the majority of patients 
in the TCZ groups presented with clinical signs and symptoms in the absence of elevated ESR attributed to 
GCA. In contrast, the placebo patients were reported with flares due to clinical signs and symptoms both in 
the presence and absence of an elevated ESR attributable to GCA. Eight first flares due to an elevated ESR 
in the absence of clinical GCA signs and symptoms were reported in the placebo groups compared to one 
such flare in the TCZ QW group only. 
Elevated CRP without flare includes all patients who had two consecutive CRP elevations between Week 12 
and Week 52. Consecutive CRP elevations (without flare) were reported in higher proportions of patients in 
the placebo groups (PBO + 26 wk: 52.0%; PBO + 52 wk: 60.8%) compared to the TCZ groups (TCZ QW: 
5.0%; TCZ Q2W: 6.1%). The majority of CRP elevations were in those patients classed as non-responders 
due to reporting a GCA flare, having received treatment with escape prednisone or being unable to adhere 
to the protocol defined prednisone taper. Fifteen of the patients with CRP elevations represent those who 
had not reported a flare, had not received treatment with escape prednisone and had adhered to the protocol 
defined prednisone taper, i.e. the two consecutive elevated CRP elevations was the only component of the 
remission definition that rendered these patients non-responders. A sensitivity analysis that classed these 
fifteen patients as responders still showed superiority of the two TCZ doses over PBO + 26 wk. 
There were three patients in the TCZ QW group who received > 100 mg additional prednisone from Week 12 
to Week 52 (including all escape therapy, commercial prednisone and taper prednisone [both open-label and 
blinded taper]). One patient in each of the placebo groups moved onto escape prednisone but did not receive 
>100 mg treatment. A sensitivity analysis that classed the three patients with >100 mg additional 
prednisone as non-responders still showed superiority of the two TCZ doses over PBO + 26 wk. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the 
TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 
52-week prednisone taper. 
Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority and in post hoc analyses subsequently 
superiority to placebo with regard to the key secondary endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 48/117 
 
  
  
 
 
The subsequent CMH superiority analysis, which was added post-hoc, yielded p-values of < 0.0001 for the 
TCZ QW group and 0.0002 for the TCZ Q2W group versus placebo which indicated that not only was TCZ 
combined with a 26-week prednisone taper non-inferior to placebo when combined with a 52-week 
prednisone taper but the difference in response rates met the criteria for statistical superiority of TCZ over 
placebo for both dose groups. 
Superiority of the TCZ QW dose group to the 52-week prednisone only control group was confirmed in all 
sensitivity analyses. Superiority of the TCZ Q2W arm to PBO + 52 wk was also confirmed in the sensitivity 
analysis that included all subjects regardless of adherence to the prednisone taper. The TCZ Q2W arm met 
non-inferiority for both the sensitivity analysis excluding the requirement of normalized CRP (< 1 mg/dL) 
from the definition of remission and the analysis of completers adhering to study medication, but could not 
show superiority in these analyses. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
All other secondary endpoints were tested at a type I error level of 1% but were not part of the confirmatory 
testing sequence and not subject to multiplicity control. Hence, results are not confirmatory. 
• 
Time to first GCA disease flare after clinical remission (up to 52 weeks) 
Time to event analysis (stratified by starting prednisone dose) revealed a statistically significantly lower risk 
of GCA disease flare in both TCZ groups compared to the 26-week prednisone only control group. Analysis 
comparing the TCZ groups to the 52-week prednisone only control group showed a statistically significant 
lower risk of disease flare in the TCZ QW group, whereas the numerical improvement achieved in the TCZ 
Q2W group did not reach the pre-specified threshold for statistical significance (p < 0.01 defined for other 
secondary endpoints). 
•  Summary of total cumulative prednisone dose over 52 weeks 
Expected cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 was calculated based on a patient’s starting prednisone 
dose, the taper schedule (26-week or 52-week taper), and the assumption that the patient continued the 
taper without error. 
Median expected cumulative prednisone dose was, therefore, similar in the TCZ QW (1337.0 mg), TCZ Q2W 
(1442.0 mg), and PBO + 26 wk (1337.0 mg) groups and higher in the PBO + 52 wk (2607.5 mg) group. 
Median actual cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 (including all taper prednisone [both open-label and 
blinded taper]; escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) was 1862.0 mg in both of the TCZ 
QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups compared with 3296.0 mg in the PBO + 26 wk group and 3817.5 mg in 
the PBO + 52 wk group. The associated stratified analysis p-values for TCZ versus placebo in combination 
with a 26-week prednisone taper were p < 0.0001 for the TCZ QW group and p = 0.0003 for the TCZ Q2W 
group, indicating a statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ 
QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups when compared to placebo in combination with a 26 week prednisone 
taper period. 
Corresponding stratified analysis p-values for the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W groups versus placebo in 
combination with a 52-week prednisone taper were both p < 0.0001, indicating a statistically significantly 
lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups 
compared to placebo in combination with a 52 week prednisone taper. 
Of note, actual prednisone doses were much higher in all 4 study arms than expected (based on the 
individual taper regimen). Median expected cumulative prednisone doses were 1337.00 (PBO + 26 wk), 
2607.50  (PBO + 52 wk), 1337.00 (TCZ QW), and 1442.00 (TCZ Q2W) .

The increased change from baseline to Week 52 for the SF-36 Mental Component Score showed a numeric 
improvement in all treatment groups, placebo and TCZ). Comparison of TCZ to prednisone taper showed a 
numerical benefit of TCZ QW compared to PBO + 26 wk (0.61, 99% CI: -5.86,7.07) and PBO + 52 wk (4.44, 
99% CI: -0.69,9.56); A numerical benefit pf TCZ Q2W was observed in comparison to PBO + 52 wk (3.27, 
99% CI: -2.59,9.14), while a numerical disadvantage over PBO + 26 wk was observed (-0.56, 99% CI: 
-7.64,6.53). 
For the SF-36 Physical Component Score, the change from baseline to Week 52 showed a numeric 
improvement in both of the TCZ groups, while both placebo groups showed a slight worsening in PCS. 
Comparing treatment arms, only the difference observed in the TCZ QW group compared to the PBO + 52 wk 
group was statistically significant at the 0.01 significance level (p = 0.0024). All other comparisons only 
showed a numerical benefit of TCZ arms. 
•  Change from baseline in PGA of disease activity (VAS scale) at 52 weeks 
The patient global VAS item rates patients’ assessment of the effect of their GCA at the present time. A 
decline from baseline score (negative change) indicates improvement. 
All treatment groups (placebo and TCZ) showed a decline from baseline in patient’s global VAS scores. The 
TCZ Q2W group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the PBO + 26 wk group (p = 
0.0059) and PBO + 52 wk group (p = 0.0081). While not statistically significant at the pre-specified level of 
0.01, for the TCZ QW group, the mean change from baseline scores was numerically lower in the TCZ QW 
group than both PBO groups. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the change from baseline to Week 52 in 
Patient’s Global VAS based on observed data only (where post-escape PGA VAS data were included in the 
analysis and not considered as missing) again showed a statistically significant improvement for the TCZ 
Q2W group over both the PBO + 26 wk group (p = 0.0091) and PBO + 52 wk group (p = 0.0027) and a 
numerical improvement in mean change from baseline scores for the TCZ QW group compared with both 
PBO groups, although neither reached statistical significance at the pre-specified level of 0.01.

Notes 
Superiority of TCZ over PBO + 52 wk tapering was analysed post-hoc. Both 
TCZ arms had significantly higher response rates (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, 
respectively) with an overall significance level of 1% (0.5% per comparison).

No dedicated studies in special population were performed in context of the development in GCA. 
Supportive studies 
Long term extension WA28119 
Part 2 of the study WA28119 (presented as main study above) is an ongoing 104-week open-label 
extension/ long-term follow up phase, ending at Week 156. The purpose of Part 2 is to assess the long-term 
safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of therapy with TCZ, to explore the rate of relapse and the 
requirement for TCZ therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the potential long-term steroid 
sparing effect of TCZ. 
Use of SC open-label TCZ at the Week 52 visit was dependent on the remission status of the patient at that 
visit. If a patient was in remission their TCZ/placebo SC injections were stopped and they were observed in 
the absence of further TCZ treatment. If a patient was not in remission at the Week 52 visit or if a patient 
relapsed/flared at any time during Part 2, they could receive SC open-label TCZ QW at the discretion of the 
investigator, regardless of their allocated treatment regime in Part 1 of the study (to which the investigator 
remained blinded). Treatment with glucocorticoids and methotrexate are permitted at any time during Part 
2 at a dose and duration chosen by the investigator. As in Part 1 of the study, GCA flare was determined by 
the investigator and was based on the assessment of clinical signs and symptoms and ESR elevations 
attributed to GCA. The sites remained blinded to the CRP levels during Part 2 of the study. 
Patient data were treated and subsequently analysed based on response to treatment in Part 1 of the study. 
In Part 1, 88 responders (those who met the primary endpoint) were followed off TCZ treatment to assess 
the maintenance of response enabled by one year of TCZ treatment. Part 1 non-responders were analysed 
to determine whether they can attain remission following treatment with open-label TCZ QW during Part 2 
of the study. Both groups were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of open-label TCZ QW treatment in 
bringing about remission following a GCA flare. 
Patient flow 
At the time of the Part 1 data cut-off (11 April 2016), there were 88 patients who had reached the Week 100 
visit or beyond, with some patients having participated up to Week 136. Data for patients who did not reach 
the Week 100 visit due to withdrawal from the study or death during Part 2 are also included in the analysis. 
Of the 88 patients evaluated at the time of the data cut (see figure 11), 45 met the primary endpoint during 
Part 1 of the study (i.e., were in sustained remission from Week 12 to Week 52; 5 in each of the PBO groups, 
24 in the TCZ QW group and 11 in the TCZ Q2W arm). Of the remaining 43 patients who were 
non-responders in Part 1 of the study, 34 were in remission at the Week 52 visit due to treatment with 
escape prednisone. The remaining nine patients were not in remission at the Week 52 visit.

Figure 11 - Disposition of Part 2 patients 
Treatment at week 52 
Upon entering Part 2 of the study, 43 of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1 stopped their 
TCZ/placebo injections and were followed up off TCZ treatment; erroneously, one patient each from the TCZ 
QW and PBO + 52 wk groups started open-label TCZ (in the absence of glucocorticoids) at the Week 52 visit 
despite being in remission. Six patients received treatment other than or in addition to open label TCZ at the 
Week 52 visit: three received glucocorticoids alone, one received glucocorticoids plus MTX and two received 
MTX alone. 
The 34 patients who were non-responders in Part 1 of the study and were in remission at Week 52 were 
either followed up off treatment or received treatment with open-label TCZ and/or glucocorticoids and/or 
MTX.  
The nine patients who were non-responders in Part 1 of the study and were not in remission at Week 52 were 
treated with open-label TCZ and/or glucocorticoids and/or MTX.

Table 13 - Part 1 responders: Patients who flared during Part 2 
Two patients (Patients 255202/10062 and 253755/10262) were receiving treatment for their GCA at the 
time of first flare in Part 2; both patients were from the original TCZ QW group and were receiving 5 mg/day 
glucocorticoids, one (Patient 253755/10262) in combination with 15 mg MTX QW. 
Two patients (255228/10484 and 255207/10041) flared within two weeks of entering Part 2, but the 
majority of relapses occurred at least 12 weeks after the discontinuation of TCZ/placebo injections at Week 
52 There was no pattern to the timing of flares during Part 2.

Forty five patients received treatment with open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study. Eighteen patients 
started open-label TCZ at Week 52. Twenty-eight patients had a GCA flare in Part 2 that was treated with 
open-label TCZ. Two patients erroneously started open-label TCZ at study Week 53.

Table 15 - Relapse on open-lablel TCZ in Part 2 of the study 
Eleven patients (65%) relapsed while receiving treatment with open-label TCZ; ten were non-responders in 
Part 1 (due to non-adherence to the protocol defined prednisone taper, elevations in CRP or withdrawal from 
the study) or had flared during Part 1 of the study. Three patients relapsed within a few weeks of starting 
open-label TCZ, which likely represents inadequate disease control after the initiation of open-label TCZ in 
Part 2.  
Four of the flares were second flares in patients who had initiated open-label TCZ to treat a previous relapse 
during Part 2. One patient relapsed twice while receiving treatment with open-label TCZ. 
Of the 11 patients who relapsed on open-label TCZ during Part 2, six were receiving concomitant treatment 
with glucocorticoids and one patient was also receiving MTX at the time of flare.  
Tocilizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in giant cell arteritis: A Phase 2, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (supportive phase II investor-initiated study 
ML25676) 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study the use of IV TCZ in 30 patients aged > 
50 years and diagnosed with GCA according to the 1990 ACR criteria (Villiger et al. 2016). Patients with new 
onset or relapsing disease were randomized (2:1) to receive 8 mg/kg IV TCZ every 4 weeks (Q4W) or 
placebo over 1 year. Patients received concomitant glucocorticoids (prednisolone), at a starting dose of 1 
mg/kg/day and were tapered in a controlled fashion to 0.1 mg/kg/day by Week 12. Subsequently, the daily 
glucocorticoid dose was further reduced by 1 mg every month. 
Efficacy Results 
Complete remission by Week 12 was reached in 17/20 (85%) patients treated with TCZ compared to 4/10 
(40%) patients treated with placebo (difference [95% CI]: 45% [11%, 79%]; p = 0.0301). Relapse-free

survival was achieved in 17/20 (85%) patients in the TCZ group and 2/10 (20%) patients in the placebo 
group by Week 52 (difference [95% CI]: 65% [36%, 94%]; p = 0.0010). The mean time difference to stop 
glucocorticoids was 12 weeks in favour of TCZ (95% CI: 7, 17; p < 0.0001), leading to a weight-adjusted 
cumulative prednisolone dose of 43 mg/kg (median IQR: 39, 52) in the TCZ group versus 110 mg/kg 
(median IQR: 88, 150) in the placebo group (p = 0.0005) after 52 weeks. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study WA28119 is a Phase III, multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group 
superiority trial in patients with GCA designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCZ for the treatment of 
GCA. The study includes a 52-week blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 
2), with a total duration of the study of 156 weeks.  
The target population for this study were adult patients with GCA who have active disease (signs and 
symptoms and elevated ESR) within the 6 weeks prior to baseline visit. Because the Sponsor anticipated that 
the vast majority of subjects enrolled to WA28119 would meet the ACR 1990 classification criteria for the 
diagnosis of GCA, the inclusion criteria were broadly based around these criteria. However, since much 
progress has been made in understanding the clinical presentation and pathology of the disease since 1990 
the sponsor modified these criteria. New vascular imaging modalities having all emerged and altered the 
approach to diagnosing GCA, therefore, revised diagnostic criteria were used that are consistent with current 
clinical practice. These inclusion criteria that consider a broader array of cranial symptoms that occur in GCA 
beyond headache alone (e.g., jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, ischemia-related vision loss); PMR 
symptoms occurring in the setting of GCA proven by either biopsy or imaging; and evidence of large vessel 
vasculitis in cross-sectional imaging (MRA, CTA, PET-CT, or angiography), none of which were included in 
the 1990 criteria. This approach is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Patients were screened up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to the baseline randomization visit. During the 
screening period, patients could receive glucocorticoids for the treatment of GCA at the discretion of the 
investigator. By the end of the screening period patients had to switch to the Sponsor-provided prednisone 
in order to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper in combination with either placebo or two different 
TCZ regimens. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio into four groups: Placebo SC weekly (QW) + 
26-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 26 wk; n = 50); Placebo SC QW + 52-week prednisone taper 
regimen (PBO + 52 wk; n = 51), 162 mg TCZ SC QW + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ QW; n = 
100)and 162 mg TCZ SC every other week (Q2W) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ Q2W; n = 50). 
The corner stone of management of GCA is immediate initiation of treatment (i.e. high-dose 
glucocorticosteroide treatment) after clinical suspicion of GCA is raised in order to prevent further visual loss 
and other ischaemic complications. It is further recommend to maintain the initial high dose for a month and 
taper gradually thereafter (BSR and BHPR Guidelines for the management of giant cell arteritis: 
doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keq039b; EULAR recommendations for the management of large vessel 
vasculitis Ann Rheum Dis 2009;68:318-323 doi:10.1136/ard.2008.088351). Improvement of symptoms is 
typical expected within 72 hours after initiation of standard therapy. However, TCZ was initiated up to 42 
days (6 weeks) after initiation of treatment for GCA; in parallel the prednisone taper regimen was started. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ compared to placebo, in combination 
with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen. Therefore the MAH implemented the requirement “induction of 
remission within 12 weeks of randomisation”, thus remission was investigated max 18 weeks after 
(suspected) onset of GCA. For the purpose to evaluate the primary study endpoint this approach is 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 56/117 
 
  
  
acceptable. Unfortunately the design of study WA28119 does not allow to directly assessing the question of 
early disease control; it rather enables to evaluate TCZ supporting the prednisone tapering regimen.  
It is acknowledged that early disease control in GCA is important – a fact that is reinforced by way of 
treatment guidelines stating that high-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated immediately upon 
clinical suspicion of GCA (Warrington and Matteson, 2007; Dasgupta et al, 2010). However, despite the 
rapidity of the initial response, the majority of patients relapse either during tapering or after complete 
withdrawal of glucocorticoids (Martinez-Lado et al 2011; Andersson et al 1986; Proven et al 2003; Alba et al 
2014). Therefore, there is still an unmet need in identifying an agent capable of maintaining disease 
remission during glucocorticoid tapering, particularly when daily doses begin to reach levels at which 
patients typically experience disease relapse. 
Data from the WA28119 study demonstrate a superior treatment effect of TCZ at 52 weeks, but also show 
an impact on treatment response as early as Week 1 after initiation of TCZ treatment. Thus, the differences 
in efficacy across groups were present at the earliest possible time points for assessment. These exploratory 
findings provide evidence on the efficacy of TCZ in establishing early disease control, even though this was 
not the principal aim of study WA28119. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 treated with 
TCZ (QW or Q2W) or placebo in combination with 26 weeks prednisone taper regimen. The key secondary 
efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 treated with TCZ (QW or 
Q2W) or placebo in combination with 52 weeks prednisone taper regimen. Both endpoints are considered 
acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 251 patients were enrolled into the study (100 patients to the TCZ QW group, 50 patients to the 
TCZ Q2W group, 50 patients to the PBO + 26 wk group and 51 patients to the PBO + 52 wk group), 250 
patients received the treatment to which they were assigned. GCA disease characteristics were well 
balanced between the treatment groups. 
The efficacy data are based on the primary analysis, which was conducted after all patients had completed 
the double-blind treatment period (i.e., 52 weeks of study treatment unless the patient was prematurely 
withdrawn). Patients who flared and received escape therapy, who did not adhere to the prednisone taper 
regimen (i.e., were given more than 100 mg additional glucocorticoids), who had two consecutive CRP 
elevations (> 1 mg/dL) between Weeks 12 and 52, who withdrew from the study prior to Week 52, or for 
whom a remission status could not be determined at Week 52, were classed as non-responders in the 
primary analysis. 
The primary endpoint, superiority of each of the TCZ arms (with 26 week prednisone tapering) over PBO with 
26 week tapering, was met. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved in 56.0% of patients in the TCZ 
QW group, 53.1% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group and 14.0% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group. The 
difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ QW group and placebo was 42.0% (99.5% CI: 
18.0 to 66.0), with an associated p-value of < 0.0001. The difference in the percentage of responders 
between the TCZ Q2W dose group and placebo was 39.1% (99.5% CI: 12.5 to 65.7), with a p-value of < 
0.0001.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the 
TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 
52-week prednisone taper. Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority. In post hoc 
analyses subsequently superiority to placebo was shown with regard to the key secondary endpoint. 
Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved by 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017 
Page 57/117 
 
  
  
in the TCZ Q2W group and 17.6% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The difference in the percentage of 
responders in the TCZ QW group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 38.4% (99.5% CI: 17.9 to 58.8) and 
the difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ Q2W group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 
35.4% (99.5% CI: 10.4 to 60.4). The lower boundaries of the 99.5% CIs for both TCZ dose groups were 
greater than the non-inferiority margin of -22.5%, meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. Of note, the 
non-inferiority analysis was not planned in the protocol. The margin was derived in the SAP based on a single 
study only. Clinical grounds for the margin were not specified. 
Superiority of the TCZ QW dose group to the 52-week prednisone only control group was confirmed in all 
sensitivity analyses, but not for the TCZ Q2W group, which failed to show significant superiority in some of 
the sensitivity analyses.  
Although the median cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 was higher than expected in all groups, a 
statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W 
treatment groups in combination with a 26 week prednisone taper period when compared to placebo was 
reported. Median actual cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 (including all taper prednisone [both 
open-label and blinded taper]; escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) was 1862.0 mg in 
both of the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups compared with 3296.0 mg in the PBO + 26 wk group 
and 3817.5 mg in the PBO + 52 wk group. The associated stratified analysis p-values for TCZ versus placebo 
in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper were p < 0.0001 for the TCZ QW group and p = 0.0003 for 
the TCZ Q2W group. The significant lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both TCZ groups as 
compared to the placebo groups might have contributed to the more favourable safety profile under TCZ 
treatment compared to placebo.  
Data from the LTE part of study WA28119 are available for 88 patients, followed up to 136 weeks. Of these 
43 of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1, stopped their TCZ/placebo injections and were 
followed up off TCZ treatment. Of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1 of the study, 27 
remained in remission throughout available follow up during Part 2. GCA flares were observed in 18 patients; 
1/5 from the PBO + 26 wk group (20%), 1/5 from the PBO + 52 wk group (20%), 8/24 from the TCZ QW 
group (33%), and 8/11 from the TCZ Q2W group (73%).  
These data suggest that in the TCZ groups a higher incidence of flares was observed after stopped their TCZ 
treatment at 52 weeks than in the placebo groups. However, since the study is still ongoing and these 
interim data are derived from small patient groups, a firm conclusion cannot be drawn at this point in time. 
However a rebound after TCZ discontinuation cannot be totally excluded.  
The final WA28119 study report will be submitted by Q4 2018, where a possible rebound effect can be 
further re-assessed based on new data. This long term data will allow a proper assessment of the long-term 
efficacy i.e. maintenance of efficacy and safety. The MAH has committed to state the lack of data in the RMP 
under missing information. The final CSR and updated RMP will be submitted by Q1 2019. 
Additional evidence for efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of GCA was provided from the data of the 
investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study ML25676. Patients aged 
> 50 years with new onset or relapsing GCA (according to the 1990 ACR criteria) (Villiger et al. 2016) were 
randomized (2:1) to receive 8 mg/kg IV TCZ every 4 weeks (Q4W) or placebo over 1 year. Patients received 
concomitant glucocorticoids (prednisolone), at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were tapered in a 
controlled fashion to 0.1 mg/kg/day by Week 12. Subsequently, the daily glucocorticoid dose was further 
reduced by 1 mg every month. The study showed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of 
TCZ-treated patients achieving complete remission at Week 12 (primary endpoint) compared to those 
receiving glucocorticoids alone (TCZ plus glucocorticoids: 85% [17/20]; placebo plus glucocorticoids: 40% 
[4/10]). There was also a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients that were 
relapse-free at Week 52 in the TCZ group in comparison to the placebo group as well as a significant 
reduction in the cumulative weight-adjusted prednisolone dose between the TCZ and placebo groups.

Although the design of this trial was more suitable to evaluate the effect on TCZ on the entire course of GCA, 
especially the effect on timely disease control, these data are only supportive since the TCZ dose and route 
of administration (8 mg/kg IV Q4W) differ from the claimed dosage. Moreover the provided data 
(publication) do not allow an in-depth assessment. 
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study WA28119 met its primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating that TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 
Q2W in combination with a 26 wk or 52 wk resp. prednisone tapering regime are effective at maintaining 
steroid-free remission in patients with GCA. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
TCZ is a recombinant humanised anti-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 
receptor (IL-6R) that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R, thereby inhibiting 
IL-6-mediated signalling. TCZ is available in 2 different pharmaceutical forms to allow either administration 
by intravenous (IV) infusion or by subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
In adult patient both pharmaceutical forms of TCZ are approved. TCZ is indicated in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients 
who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. In these 
patients, TCZ can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with 
MTX is inappropriate.  
The recommended dose for IV administration is 8 mg/kg TCZ every 4 weeks (q4w). 
For SC administration, the recommended dose is 162 mg once every week (qw). 
Regarding the safety profile of TCZ in the adult RA population, unfavourable effects include infection, 
gastro-intestinal disorders, infusion reactions, skin disorders, neutropenia, elevation in hepatic enzymes and 
lipid parameters. 
The safety data base supporting this application is derived primarily from the single pivotal Phase III Study 
WA28119. After the 52-week double-blind treatment period (reported in this assessment report), all 
patients entered the 104-week LTE/long-term follow-up (Part 2) of the study. Based on the investigator’s 
assessment of GCA disease activity at the end of the 52-week double-blind period, the patient was either 
given the option to receive open-label TCZ 162 mg QW (in case of persistent disease activity/flare) or was 
followed up off treatment for maintenance of established remission at the investigators discretion. A 
patient’s GCA therapy could be adjusted at any time during Part 2 of the study at the investigator’s discretion 
and on the basis of disease activity. This could have included initiation/termination of open-label TCZ 162 
mg QW and/or changes to corticosteroid or methotrexate (MTX) treatment. 
In addition to the Phase III study, the following data are submitted as supportive safety data  
•  Results from a Phase II investigator-initiated trial (ML25676), studying intravenous (IV) TCZ in 
patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA

Further the following data are also included in the submission 
• 
Pooled long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, referred to as 
LTE All-exposure RA population 
•  Background rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and glucocorticoid- induced toxicity

The MarketScan analysis is a retrospective cohort study of glucocorticoid use and AEs in patients with GCA 
(who were not treated with TCZ) in the United States from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2015. 
Background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the 
MarketScan analysis are presented to contextualize rates reported with TCZ treatment in Study WA28119.

Patient exposure 
Study WA28119 
The Safety population included data from 250 patients who received at least one administration of study 
drug and had at least one post-dose safety assessment (withdrawal, AE, death, laboratory assessment, or 
vital sign assessment). Of the 251 randomized patients, 1 patient who was randomized to the TCZ Q2W 
group withdrew prior to receiving their first dose of TCZ. This patient was excluded from the Safety analysis 
population. 
Median study duration was identical (1.0 year) in all treatment groups. Based on the number of doses of SC 
study treatment (TCZ/ placebo) received, the patient-years of exposure were similar in the TCZ Q2W and 
placebo groups. Given that twice as many patients were randomized to the TCZ QW group, the total number 
of patient years of exposure (86.41 patient-years) was much higher than in the TCZ Q2W group (43.7 
patient-years), PBO + 26 wk group (44.3 patient-years) and PBO + 52 wk group (46.0 patient-years).

Glucocorticoid-induced toxicity 
Events that are consistent with glucocorticoid-induced toxicity from Part 1 of Study WA28119 were analysed 
retrospectively using criteria that were developed by the Sponsor prior to database lock. 
Total prednisone exposure 
Median total prednisone treatment duration was 52 weeks (1 year) in all treatment groups, accounting for 
open-label prednisone taper, blinded prednisone/placebo as well as escape and commercial prednisone (for 
concomitant conditions). Median total cumulative prednisone dose was identical in the TCZ QW and TCZ 
Assessment report  
EMA/562609/2017

Q2W groups (1862 mg). However, as a result of the increased use of escape glucocorticoid therapy (and 
longer prednisone taper period in the PBO + 52 wk group), median total cumulative prednisone dose was 
higher in the PBO + 26 wk (3296 mg) and PBO + 52 wk (3817.5 mg) groups. 
Study WA28119 Part 2 − open-label extension (Part 2) 
Eighty-eight patients included in the data analysis of Part 2 had at least 100 weeks of follow-up in the study. 
As of the data cut-off date (11 April 2016), some patients had continued in Part 2 of the study up to Week 
136 (scheduled visit); hence the range for duration of follow-up in Part 2 ranges from 48 to 84 weeks. The 
majority (66/88) of these patients had received TCZ either during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. Of the 88 
patients; 50 had received either TCZ QW or TCZ Q2W during Part 1, and 27 of these patients started 
open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study. Of the 38 patients, who were randomized to the placebo groups 
during Part 1, a further 16 patients received open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study. 
Exposure in PY is not summarized for this period because there was no predefined treatment regimen, 
leading to inconsistent exposure to study drug within or between patients. 
Phase II investigator-initiated trial ML25676 
Twenty patients received TCZ + prednisolone (hereafter referred to as the TCZ group) and 10 patients 
received placebo + prednisolone (hereafter referred to as the placebo group). 
Clinical trial information from patients with RA treated with IV tocilizumab 
The safety dataset (May 2012 data cut; referred to as the LTE all-exposure RA population) includes data 
from 4171 patients who received at least 1 dose of TCZ in the clinical trial program.

AEs considered related to blinded study treatment (TCZ, prednisone or both) by the investigator (i.e., TCZ, 
prednisone, or both) were reported in 68% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 74% of patients in the TCZ Q2W 
group, 64% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 53% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The SOCs 
with the highest incidence of AEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were Infections 
and Infestations (most commonly [i.e., ≥  5% overall incidence] nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection, bronchitis, cystitis, and oral herpes), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (most commonly 
alopecia), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (most commonly oedema peripheral), and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders. 
Study WA28119 Part 2 − open-label extension 
Eighty-eight patients were included in the Part 2 data cut. The majority (66/88) of these patients had 
received TCZ either during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. 
Eighty-one of the 88 patients (92.0%) reported at least one AE in Part 2 of Study WA28119. Causality has 
not been assessed in the evaluation of non-serious events. 
The highest incidence of AEs was reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC (51/88 [58.0%]); most 
commonly nasopharyngitis (15/88 [17.0%]) and bronchitis (10/88 [11.4%]). This was followed by AEs in

Three serious gastrointestinal complications were reported in the TCZ group: one patient not taking 
prescribed pantoprazole developed a pre-pyloric ulcer perforation, the second suffered hepatopathy due to 
an undefined viral infection, and the third patient underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy due to 
gastrointestinal bleeding 12 days after start of TCZ treatment. 
One eye infection due to Moraxella catarrhalis and herpes led to inpatient treatment in a patient in the TCZ 
group. 
A case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome developed in another TCZ patient 3 days after the third infusion, the 
causal relationship could not be determined because multiple drugs had been started within the possible 
timeframe.

The serious infection events of gastroenteritis and herpes zoster were both observed in 2 patients each in the 
PBO + 52 wk group. All other serious infections were single occurrences. Three urinary tract-related serious 
events (urinary tract infection, urosepsis, and pyelonephritis) were reported in a single patient. 
Opportunistic infections were reported in 2 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group (Grade 3 genital herpes zoster 
and Grade 1 cytomegalovirus infection) and 1 patient in the TCZ Q2W group (Grade 1 oropharyngeal

In addition to the opportunistic infections defined by the Roche AEGT basket, the sponsor performed a 
manual review of additional potential opportunistic infections reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC 
(‘herpes zoster’ and ‘tuberculosis’). Herpes zoster was reported in 5 patients (5.0%) in the TCZ QW group, 
2 patients (4.1%) in the TCZ Q2W group, 0 patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 2 patients (3.9%) in the

outside of clinical trials 
Of the 105 case reports reviewed none were published with a primary focus on safety of TCZ. No AEs were 
reported following treatment with IV TCZ for the majority of patients, and safety data were not provided for 
a few cases in these published reports. The nature of the events reported was consistent with the established 
safety profile of TCZ. Four deaths were reported due to myocardial infarction, septic shock, stroke, and 
sepsis (Toussirot et al. 2016). 
Laboratory findings 
Study WA28119 (52 weeks double blind treatment) 
Decreases from baseline were observed in mean and median neutrophil and platelet counts. 
Neutropenia (including “decreased neutrophil count”) was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW 
group and 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W group. One patient with neutropenia in the TCZ QW group was 
withdrawn from all study treatment because of the event. An additional 2 patients in the TCZ QW group, had 
a TCZ study treatment dose interruption/modification due to neutropenia. Review of the clinical listings 
showed that there was no association between Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia and serious infections. 
Thrombocytopenia (including platelet count decreased) was reported as an AE in 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W 
group. Neither patient was withdrawn from study treatment because of the event. One patient 
(255731/11201) had a TCZ study treatment dose interruption/modification due to both platelet count 
decreased and ALT increased. Both events were Grade 1 in severity and resolved without sequelae. 
Neither of the thrombocytopenia events was associated with a bleeding event. 
Notable changes from baseline were observed for liver (ALT, AST) and lipid (total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol) parameters as well as glycated haemoglobin (Hb A1c). No clinically relevant changes over time 
were observed for other serum chemistry parameters.  
“Alanine aminotransferase increased” was reported as an AE in 5 patients in the TCZ QW group, and 2 
patients in each of the TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 wk groups. “Aspartate aminotransferase increased” was 
reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group, and 1 patient in each of the TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 
wk groups. No patients were withdrawn from study treatment because of these AEs. However, TCZ study 
treatment dose interruptions/modifications due to these AEs were reported for 4 patients in the TCZ QW 
group, 1 patient in the TCZ Q2W group. 
“Hepatic enzyme increased” was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group and 2 patients in the 
PBO + 52 wk group. One event of “hepatic enzyme increased” in the PBO + 52 wk group was reported as a 
SAE (Grade 4) and led to TCZ study treatment interruption. None of the other events led to treatment 
withdrawal or study treatment interruption. 
No AEs associated with other serum chemistry parameters (i.e., total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and 
lipids) were reported in the study.

Immunogenicity 
The anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay applied in the TCZ development program is a quasi-quantitative assay, 
in which ADA levels were determined against a calibration curve generated from an anti-TCZ antibody 
positive control. The “relative ADA concentration” is provided in table 35 below for those GCA patients who 
developed ADA during the study.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There was no formal drug-drug interaction measurements carried out during GiACTA and ML25676 studies. 
Potential indirect effect of TCZ on the expression of CYP3A4 metabolising enzyme and a consequent 
increased elimination of prednisone is discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology subsection of this AR. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 36 - Rates of adverse events leading to TCZ withdrawal in the TCZ treatment groups in Study 
WA28119 (Part 1) and LTE RA dataset 
In Study WA28119 11 patients (11%) in the TCZ QW group, 5 patients (10%) in the TCZ Q2W group, 3 
patients (6%) in the PBO + 26 wk group and no patient in the PBO + 52 wk group experienced ARs leading 
the withdrawal. No individual AE preferred term was reported by more than 1 patient in any treatment group 
The most common AEs that resulted in withdrawal of study treatment in the LTE all-exposure RA population 
were associated with the Infections and Infestations.  
Phase II investigator-initiated trial ML25676 
Three patients were withdrawn from treatment prior to Week 12 due to AEs (1 patient, TCZ group) and SAEs 
(1 patient each in the TCZ and placebo groups). 
Post marketing experience 
TCZ is currently approved worldwide for the treatment of RA (IV and SC formulations), polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (IV formulation), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (IV formulation). In India and 
Japan, TCZ has an additional indication for treatment in Castleman’s disease (IV formulation).  
Since the IBD (11 April 2005) to 10 April 2016, an estimated cumulative total of 664,900 patients (522,482 
PY) have received TCZ from marketing experience. The cumulative post-marketing exposure to SC TCZ is 
92,216 patients (74,669 PY). 
Cumulatively up to 10 April 2016, a total of 154,459 events had been recorded on the Company Global 
Safety Database. Of these, 42,797 events were considered as SAEs. The most common AEs (≥ 10%) from 
post-marketing sources were within the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (16.4%); General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (15.7%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (11.7%), and 
Investigations (10%).

The safety profile of SC TCZ (with the exception of ISRs, which were more common with SC TCZ) was 
comparable with the safety profile of IV TCZ. No new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed 
with the SC formulation. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety data supporting this application are derived primarily from the pivotal study WA28119. 
Data from 250 patients treated for 52 weeks (Part 1) period and interim data from 88 patients in the LTE 
phase (Part 2) who had at least 100 weeks of follow up are included in the safety data base. The data base 
is further supported by results from a Phase II investigator-initiated trial (ML25676), studying intravenous 
(IV) TCZ in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA; pooled long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, which included 4171 patients, and analysis of adverse events (AEs) 
reported in single case reports of patients with GCA treated with IV TCZ outside of clinical trials. As reference 
background rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and glucocorticoid- induced toxicity 
information from an epidemiological analysis of the MarketScan health claims database are included in the 
submission. Although the clinical trial database for GCA is small, given the long experience with TCZ IV and 
TCZ SC formulation, this is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
In Part 1 of study WA28119 most patients in the study experienced at least one AE, with the proportion of 
such patients ranging between 92.2% and 98.0% across treatment groups. The number of individual events 
were numerically lower in the TCZ treatment groups (470 events in the PBO + 26 wk group and 486 in the 
PBO + 52 wk groups vs 432 events in the TCZ Q2W group and 810 events in TCZ QW [which included twice 
as many patients than the other groups]). This translates into numerically higher rates of 990.8 AEs [95% 
CI: 903.19, 1084.5] or 1011.2 [95% CI: 923.31, 1105.3] AEs per 100 patient years (PY) in the PBO + 26 wk 
and PBO + 52 wk groups, respectively, versus 872.0 AEs [95% CI: 813.00, 934.21] or 948.0 [95% CI: 
860.67, 1041.7] AEs per 100 PY in the TCZ QW and Q2W groups, respectively.  
The percentage of patients who experienced at least one AE during the 52 week double-blind study period 
was comparable between the different treatment groups. The SOC with the highest incidence of all-grade AE 
reporting was infections and infestations. The next highest incidence was in the Musculoskeletal and 
Connective Tissue Disorders SOC. 
The SAE rate per 100 PY of exposure was numerically lower in both TCZ arms (29.1 [95% CI: 19.2, 42.3] 
events per 100 PY in the TCZ QW group and 21.9 [95% CI: 10.5, 40.4] events per 100 PY in the TCZ Q2W 
group) compared with the placebo arms (31.6 [95% CI: 17.7, 52.2] events per 100 PY in the PBO + 26 wk 
group), with the highest AE rate occurring in the PBO + 52 wk group (43.7 [95% CI: 27.0, 66.8] events per 
100 PY). No deaths were reported during Part 1 of Study WA28119.  
For several of the pre-specified AESI categories i.e. anaphylaxis, serious bleeding, serious myocardial 
infarction, serious gastrointestinal perforation, serious hepatic events, serious demyelinating events, there 
were no events observed in the trial.  
The rates of infections, serious infections, injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions and stroke were 
low and occurred with comparable frequency in all treatment groups.  
The rates of malignancies were numerically lower in the TCZ groups compared with the placebo groups, but 
with overlapping CIs. Overall, the rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the 
reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database. Of note, ICD-9 codes used for extracting 
AESIs from the MarketScan database may not map exactly with the MedDRA codes used in Study WA28119 
(Part 1), hence no direct comparisons should be made. 
Decreases from baseline were observed in mean and median neutrophil and platelet counts. Neutropenia 
(including “decreased neutrophil count”) was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group and 2

patients in the TCZ Q2W group. Review of the clinical listings showed that there was no association between 
Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia and serious infections. Thrombocytopenia (including platelet count 
decreased) was reported as an AE in 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W group. Neither of the thrombocytopenia 
events was associated with a bleeding event. 
No safety analyses based on demographic and other intrinsic factors (age, gender, race, weight, BMI, 
medical history) were performed. 
Events that are consistent with glucocorticoid-induced toxicity from Part 1 of Study WA28119 were analysed 
retrospectively using criteria that were developed by the Sponsor prior to database lock. In Study WA28119, 
during the 52-week double-blind phase (Part 1), the proportion of patients who experienced any potentially 
glucocorticoid-induced toxicity events was numerically lower in both the TCZ groups (21.0% in TCZ QW and 
18.4% in TCZ Q2W) compared with the placebo groups (28.0% in PBO + 26 wk and 29.4% in PBO + 52 wk). 
It should be noted that these data from Study WA28119 were analysed retrospectively and were not based 
on standard or pre-specified criteria. Additionally, the duration of the study was considered too short for 
some of these events to manifest. 
The MarketScan data analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the likelihood (odds ratio = 1.17, 
95% CI: 1.06, 1.29) of patients experiencing any glucocorticoid-related event associated with each 1 gram 
increase in cumulative glucocorticoid dose in the first year following diagnosis with GCA. 
The proportion of AEs leading to withdrawal from TCZ/placebo treatment was 6.0% in the PBO + 26wk group 
and 11.0% and 10.2% in the TCZ groups. There were no such events in the PBO + 52wk group. 
Data from the LTE phase (Part 2) of study WA28119 as well as data from the investigator-initiated trial 
(ML25676) are consistent with the data from Part 1 of study WA28119. Importantly no signals were 
observed in Part 2 of the study which precludes treatment beyond week 52. 
These results demonstrate that the safety profile of TCZ SC (QW and Q2W) in GCA is comparable with the 
known the known safety profile in RA.  
Background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the 
MarketScan analysis are presented to contextualize rates reported with TCZ treatment in Study WA28119 
for some AESIS, overall, the rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the 
reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of TCZ 162 mg SC (QW and Q2W) in GCA is in line with the known safety profile in RA and 
no new safety concerns were identified. 
The safety profile in the placebo groups was less favourable than in the i.e. a higher SAE rate was reported 
in the placebo groups.  
The favourable safety profile of TCZ in GCA patients was also confirmed evaluating background AESI rates 
and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan. These data 
indicate that rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the 
GCA cohort from the MarketScan database.

(see section 4.8, Undesirable Effects). TCZ treatment should 
not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 
4.3). Administration of TCZ should be interrupted if a patient 
develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled 
(see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise 
caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with a 
history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying 
conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes, and interstitial lung 
disease which may predispose patients to infections.  
Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is 
recommended for patients receiving biological treatments for 
moderate to severe RA, sJIA or pJIA as signs and symptoms of 
acute inflammation may be lessened, associated with 
suppression of the acute phase reaction. The effects of 
tocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs 
and symptoms of infection should be considered when 
evaluating a patient for a potential infection. Patients (which 
includes younger children with sJIA or pJIA who may be less 
able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians 
of sJIA or pJIA patients, should be instructed to contact their 
healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms 
suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid 
evaluation and appropriate treatment. 
Tuberculosis  
As recommended for other biological treatments, RA, sJIA and 
pJIA patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) 
infection prior to starting TCZ therapy. Patients with latent TB 
should be treated with standard anti-mycobacterial therapy 
before initiating TCZ. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of 
false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood 
test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or 
immunocompromised.  
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if 
signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, 
low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur 
during or after therapy with TCZ..

Warnings and Precautions 
If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you 
often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel 
unwell. TCZ can reduce your body’s ability to respond to 
infections and may make an existing infection worse or 
increase the chance of getting a new infection. 
If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will 
check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting 
TCZ. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear 
during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

Gastrointestinal Perforation 
During the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of 
gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient 
years with tocilizumab therapy. In the long-term exposure 
population the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 
0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of gastrointestinal 
perforation on tocilizumab were primarily reported as 
complications of diverticulitis including generalised purulent 
peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and 
abscess.

Infusion Reactions  
In the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated 
with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 
hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the 
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients 
in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during the 
infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events 
reported within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were 
headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events 
were not treatment limiting. 
The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 
8/4,009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold higher with the 4 
mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically 
significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with 
tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were 
reported in a total of 56 out of 4,009 patients (1.4%) treated 
with tocilizumab during the controlled and open label clinical 
studies. These reactions were generally observed during the 
second to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal 
anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation 
during treatment with intravenous [IV Formulation only] 
tocilizumab (see section 4.4).

Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have 
been reported in association with TCZ (see section 4.8). Such 
reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in 
patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions 
during previous treatment with tocilizumab even if they have 
received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an 
anaphylactic reaction or other serious hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs, administration of TCZ should be stopped 
immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated and 
tocilizumab should be permanently discontinued.

Paediatric population 
sJIA : 
Infusion Reactions 
Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring 
during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 12 week 
controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group 
experienced events occurring during infusion. One event 
(angioedema) was considered serious and life threatening, 
and the patient was discontinued from study treatment. 
In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the 
tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group 
experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. At week 
260, 12 patients had experienced 16 events during infusion 
giving a rate of events of 4.4 per 100 patient years. In the 
tocilizumab group, the events included, but were not limited 
to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia 
and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered 
serious. 
Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with 
tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation, were 
reported in 1 out of 112 patients (< 1%) treated with 
tocilizumab during the controlled and up to and including the 
open label clinical trial. 
pJIA: 
Infusion Reactions 
In pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all 
events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In 
the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) 
experienced infusion reactions during the infusion and 38 
patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an 
infusion. The most common events occuring during infusion 
were headache, nausea and hypotension and within 24 hours 
of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the 
adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of 
an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and sJIA 
patients, see section 4.8.  
No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated 
with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were 
reported.

Haematological abnormalities  
Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred 
following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination 
with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of 
neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated 
with a TNF antagonist. 
In patients not previously treated with TCZ, initiation is not 
recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) below 2 x 109/L. Caution should be exercised when 
considering initiation of TCZ treatment in patients with a low 
platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 103/ μL). In 
patients who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 109/L or a platelet count 
< 50 x 103/μL, continued treatment is not recommended. 
Severe neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk 
of serious infections, although there has been no clear 
association between decreases in neutrophils and the 
occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with TCZ to 
date.  
In RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be 
monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter 
according to standard clinical practice. For recommended 
dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see

RA 
Active hepatic disease and hepatic impairment  
Treatment with TCZ, particularly when administered 
concomitantly with MTX, may be associated with elevations in 
hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised 
when considering treatment of patients with active hepatic 
disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Hepatic transaminase elevations  
In clinical trials, transient or intermittent mild and moderate 
elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported 
commonly with TCZ treatment, without progression to hepatic 
injury (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these 
elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs 
(e.g. MTX) were used in combination with TCZ. When clinically 
indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should 
be considered. 
Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of 
TCZ treatment in patients with elevated ALT or AST > 1.5 x 
ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, 
treatment is not recommended. 
In RA patients, ALT and AST levels should be monitored every 
4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment followed by 
every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications 
based on transaminases see section 4.2. For ALT or AST 
elevations > 3–5 x ULN, confirmed by repeat testing, TCZ 
treatment should be interrupted.

Hepatic transaminase elevations  
During the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in

and in 6.5% of patients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab 
plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus 
DMARDs. 
The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to 
tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of 
these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were 
observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 
1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of 
whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab 
treatment. These elevations were not associated with 
clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, nor were they 
associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic 
impairment. During the double-blind controlled period, the 
incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of 
normal, collected as a routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% 
in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A

Lipid parameters  
Elevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with 
tocilizumab (see section 4.8). In the majority of patients, 
there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in 
total cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering 
agents. 
RA Patients 
In RA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be 
performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of TCZ therapy. 
Patients should be managed according to local clinical 
guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia. 
Cardiovascular Risk  
RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular 
disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. 
GCA Patients 
In GCA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be

patients (1.6%) who developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 
had an associated medically significant hypersensitivity 
reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. Thirty patients (1.1%) developed neutralising 
antibodies.  
In SC-I, a total of 625 patients treated with tocilizumab 162

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes 
demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. 
Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes. 
In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were 
decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of 
tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, 
those observed in healthy subjects.  
When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients 
taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and 
are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 (e.g. 
atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, 
warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or 
benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to 
be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long 
elimination half-life (t 1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 
enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping 
therapy.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
RoActemra is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and are typically administered in the form of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, although some physicians use pulsed intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in patients 
presenting with visual loss. Although glucocorticoids are highly effective at inducing remission of systemic 
inflammation and preventing acute damage (e.g., blindness), this comes with a high toxicity burden, with 
approximately 80% of patients suffering GC-related adverse clinical events at 10-year follow-up (Proven et 
al. 2003). In addition, GC are not as effective at maintaining remission, with many patients (up to 50%) 
experiencing relapse or flare-up of symptoms during reduction or discontinuation of glucocorticoids (Proven 
et al. 2003). Other agents, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (MTX), infliximab, and 
etanercept, have shown conflicting or no evidence of benefit in the treatment of GCA. Also, MTX is used 
inconsistently as standard of care for glucocorticoid-sparing in relapsing patients. More recently, limited 
efficacy in the treatment of GCA has been demonstrated with the use of combination treatment with 
abatacept and prednisone (Langford et al. 2015).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data to support the efficacy of tocilizumab (also known as RO4877533 and TCZ) in adult patients with giant 
cell arteritis (GCA or temporal arteritis) are provided from the pivotal Phase III trial (Study WA28119; 
GiACTA). Study WA28119 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ plus glucocorticoid treatment 
compared to treatment with glucocorticoids alone in new-onset and relapsing patients with GCA, as well as 
to evaluate the safety profile of TCZ treatment in this patient population. The study includes a 52-week 
blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 2), with a total study duration of 156 
weeks.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint, superiority of each of the TCZ arms (with 26 week prednisone tapering) over PBO with 
26 week tapering, was met. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved in 56.0% of patients in the TCZ 
QW group, 53.1% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group and 14.0% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group. The 
difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ QW group and placebo was 42.0% (99.5% CI: 
18.0 to 66.0), with an associated p-value of < 0.0001. The difference in the percentage of responders 
between the TCZ Q2W dose group and placebo was 39.1% (99.5% CI: 12.5 to 65.7), with a p-value of < 
0.0001. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the 
TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 
52-week prednisone taper. Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority. In post hoc 
analyses subsequently superiority to placebo was shown with regard to the key secondary endpoint. 
Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved by 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients 
in the TCZ Q2W group and 17.6% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The difference in the percentage of 
responders in the TCZ QW group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 38.4% (99.5% CI: 17.9 to 58.8) and 
the difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ Q2W group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 
35.4% (99.5% CI: 10.4 to 60.4). The lower boundaries of the 99.5% CIs for both TCZ dose groups were 
greater than the non-inferiority margin of -22.5%, meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. 
A statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W 
treatment groups in combination with a 26 week prednisone taper period when compared to placebo was 
reported. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The effect on entire course of GCA episode including early remission which should be the primary goal of any 
GCA treatment could not be evaluated with the current protocol.   
TCZ monotherapy was not investigated in the clinical studies. 
Data from the LTE part of study WA28119 suggest that in the TCZ groups a higher incidence of flares were 
observed after stopped their TCZ treatment at 52 weeks than in the placebo groups. A rebound effect cannot 
be excluded. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effect 
The unfavourable effects of TCZ in the treatment of patients with GCA are consistent with the known safety 
profile of TCZ and include infections, injection site reactions, immunogenicity, haematological abnormalities, 
decrease in platelet count, and elevation in hepatic transaminase and lipid parameters.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the sustained remission at week 52 is clinically meaningful. TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 
Q2W with 26 week prednisone tapering regimen was superior to placebo in combination with a 26 wk or 52 
wk resp. prednisone tapering regime and are effective at maintaining remission in patients with GCA. 
Uncertainties with regard to maintenance of the remission after week 52 i.e. after stopping TCZ regimen 
exist, since preliminary data from the LTE part might indicate a rebound. The final WA28119 study report will 
be submitted by Q4 2018, where a possible rebound effect can be further re-assessed based on new data. 
This long term data will allow a proper assessment of the long-term efficacy i.e. maintenance of efficacy and 
safety. The MAH has committed to state the lack of data in the RMP under missing information. The final CSR 
and updated RMP will be submitted by Q1 2019.

Effect on entire course of GCA episode including early remission which should be the primary goal of any GCA 
treatment could not be directly evaluated with the current protocol.  
However, data from the WA28119 study demonstrate a superior treatment effect of TCZ at 52 weeks, but 
also show an impact on treatment response as early as Week 1 after initiation of TCZ treatment. Thus, the 
differences in efficacy across groups were present at the earliest possible time points for assessment. These 
exploratory findings provide evidence on the efficacy of TCZ in establishing early disease control, even 
though this was not the principal aim of study WA28119. 
Importantly patients in both TCZ groups had a significantly lower cumulative prednisone consumption 
(including all taper prednisone, escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) than patients in 
the placebo arms. The lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both TCZ groups as compared to the 
placebo groups might have contributed to the more favourable safety profile under TCZ treatment (e.g. less 
SAE’s) compared to placebo.  
RoActemra is intended to be used in combination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. However, 
RoActemra can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. Appropriate guidance has been 
included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The favourable safety profile of TCZ in GCA patients was also confirmed evaluating background AESI rates 
and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan. These data 
indicate that rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the 
GCA cohort from the MarketScan database. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Sustained remission at week 52 was achieved under both TCZ regimens in combination with a 26 prednisone 
tapering regimen. TCZ was superior to placebo in combination with a 26 wk or 52 wk resp. prednisone 
tapering regime. Altogether the patients in both TCZ groups had a significant lower cumulative prednisone 
consumption (including all taper prednisone, escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) than 
patients in the placebo arms. This contributes largely to a better safety profile in TCZ treated patients 
compared to patients treated with prednisone alone. Considering the age group of the target population (> 
50 years) the favourable safety profile is an important factor. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of RoActemra is positive.

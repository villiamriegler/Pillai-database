1.  Introduction 
On 18th December 2017, the MAH submitted the final report and addendum of study HPN-100-011 for glycerol 
phenylbutyrate (Ravicti), according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.  This study is 
a post-authorisation measure.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Ravicti is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and paediatric patients 
≥2 months of age (European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA)/United States of America (USA)) and 
adult  and  paediatric  patients  ≥2  years  of  age  (Canada)  with  urea  cycle  disorders  (UCDs)  that  cannot  be 
managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. Ravicti (HPN-100) is a prodrug 
of phenylbutyric acid (PBA). PBA is converted via β-oxidation to its active metabolite phenylacetic acid (PAA), 
which  is  conjugated  with  glutamine  to  form  phenylacetylglutamine  (PAGN),  which  mediates  waste  nitrogen 
removal through urinary excretion.  
Ravicti  was  first  authorized  in  the  USA  in  2013,  followed  by  the  authorization  in  the  EU/EEA  in  2015  via 
centralized procedure under the name Ravicti 1.1 g/ml oral liquid. In 2016, marketing authorization for Ravicti 
was granted in Canada.  
The HPN-100-011 protocol, “Long-Term Use of HPN-100 in Urea Cycle Disorders”, allowed for continued use of 
Ravicti  for  subjects  with  a  UCD  who  had  completed  12  months  of  treatment  in  the  safety  extensions  of 
HPN-100-005 (HPN-100-005SE), HPN-100-006 (HPN-100-007), and HPN-100- 012 (HPN-100-012SE); All base 
studies and the corresponding safety extension studies were included in the original marketing authorization 
application of Ravicti in the EU.  
The purpose of the study was to provide study subjects completing Protocols HPN-100-005SE, HPN-100-007, or 
HPN-100-012SE continued access to Ravicti in the context of a protocol designed to collect long term safety 
information. The interim analysis of this study, presented as an abbreviated report dated 6 April 2014, was 
provided in the original marketing authorization application besides the above-mentioned study reports. 
The MAH stated that HPN-100-011 is a stand-alone study. 
An additional already finalized paediatric study is HPN-100-009, “An Open Label Study of the Safety, Efficacy 
and Pharmacokinetics of Glycerol Phenylbutyrate (GPB; RAVICTI®) in Pediatric Subjects Under Two Years of 
Age With Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs)”(EudraCT number 2016- 003460-38) with last patient last visit on 17 July 
2017 that is included in the paediatric investigation plan EMEA-000297-PIP02-12-M01; and the ongoing clinical 
study HPN-100-021, “A Randomised, Controlled, Open-Label Parallel Arm Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics 
and Ammonia Control of RAVICTI®  (Glycerol Phenylbutyrate [GPB]) Oral Liquid and Sodium Phenylbutyrate

(NaPBA)  in  Phenylbutyrate  Treatment  Naïve  Patients  with  Urea  Cycle  Disorders  (UCDs)”,  EudraCT  number 
2015-000075-27 which is, together with HPN-100-011, part of the post marketing commitments for FDA. 
In addition to the clinical trials, registries are underway in the US (HPN-100-014) and EU (HZNPRAV- 401). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The same formulation was used by children and adults. This is an oral solution of 1.1 g/mL HPN-100 (providing 
1.02 g/mL PBA) without any excipients. Ravicti is a colourless to pale yellow, nearly odourless and tasteless oral 
liquid and was supplied in 1-ounce teflon-screw-capped amber glass bottles containing 25 mL solution. Ravicti 
was administered undiluted orally or via gastrostomy tube. Ravicti was dispensed to the subject either through 
the  investigator  or  designee  at  each  site  or  by  a  centralized  pharmacy  per  investigator  order.  The  sponsor 
supplied food-grade flavourings provided for use by the Pharmacist, if requested by a subject. Disposable oral 
syringes and Adapta Caps™ for measuring and administering Ravicti were provided to the sites. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final report for: 
• 
Study No. HPN-100-011 (data from the majority of subjects, enrolled at 17 US sites until the product 
was approved- data collected as of 29 October 2015) 
And an addendum to this report containing further data collected in subjects (N=5) enrolled in Canada who 
continued to be monitored under the protocol of study HPN-100-011 until they discontinued or had access to 
Ravicti  through  the  Health  Canada  Special  Access  Program  or  until  Ravicti  was  commercially  available  in 
Canada- data collected as of 16 February 2017.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study No. HPN-100-011: Long-Term Use of HPN-100 in Urea Cycle Disorders 
Description

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Evaluate the long-term safety of HPN-100 (Ravicti) and its control of venous ammonia in the management of 
urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Hyperammonaemic crisis (HAC) events were to be characterized with respect to 
contributing factors such as intercurrent illness, diet and noncompliance with medication. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, long-term safety study of HPN-100 in subjects with UCD who completed the safety 
extensions  of  HPN-100-005  (HPN-100-005SE),  HPN-100-006  (HPN-100-007,  the  safety  extension  of 
HPN-100-006), and HPN-100-012 (HPN-100-012SE). Of the 90 subjects who completed the previous trials, 88 
subjects elected to enrol in this study. 
The duration of treatment was open-ended. Subjects were to be seen at a minimum of every 6 months. At each 
clinic  visit,  subjects  were  queried  about  any  adverse  events  (AEs)  or  HACs  (defined  as  clinical  symptoms 
associated with a venous ammonia concentration of ≥100 μmol/L) that occurred since the last visit, concomitant 
medication use, and current dietary protein and caloric intakes. (See section “outcomes/endpoints” for further 
assessments included in the study.)  
All  HACs  were  captured  on  the  appropriate  case  report  forms  (CRFs),  with,  at  minimum,  the  following 
information:  precipitating  factors,  if  due  to  noncompliance,  reasons  for  noncompliance,  ammonia  level  at 
hospital admission and signs and symptoms suggestive of hyperammonaemia. 
Intercurrent episodes of hyperammonaemia may have been treated with rescue medication, with or without 
haemodialysis, at the investigator’s discretion. Any hospitalization for hyperammonaemia was considered an 
SAE. 
Presence  of  at  least  2  of  the  following  clinical  criteria  constituted  evidence  of  chronic  hyperammonaemia: 
recurrent  vomiting,  protein  intolerance,  episodic  lethargy,  psychosis  (episodic),  abnormal  neurological 
examination,  brain  oedema  (evidence  on  MRI  or  CT),  chronic  migraine  headaches.  New  or  worsening 
manifestations of chronic hyperammonaemia, as compared with baseline, may have been treated with a Ravicti 
dose adjustment or the use of rescue medications. 
Study population /Sample size 
Planned: Maximum of 90 subjects, Enrolled: 88, Completed: 77, Discontinued: 6, Ongoing: 5 subjects in Canada 
Included in safety population: 88

Main criteria for inclusion: Male and non-pregnant, non-lactating females who completed the safety extensions 
of HPN-100-005 or HPN-100-012 or Study HPN-100-007 (the safety extension of HPN-100-006), and signed 
informed consent for this continued-access safety study were eligible for study participation. 
Exclusion criteria included clinical or laboratory abnormality or medical condition that, at the discretion of the 
investigator,  could  have  put  the  subject  at  increased  risk  during  participation,  known  hypersensitivity  to 
phenylacetate (PAA) or phenylbutyrate (PBA), and liver transplant (including hepatocellular transplant). 
Treatments 
Study medication: Ravicti (HPN-100; glyceryl tri-(4-phenylbutyrate) 
Dose strength and form: 1.1 g/mL solution of HPN-100, providing 1.02 g/mL PBA 
Study dosage: Individualized dose administered orally three times daily with meals. Maximum dose of 17.4 mL 
(20 g sodium phenylbutyrate [NaPBA]) per day.  
The initial dose of Ravicti was the same dose they had been taking at the completion of the previous study. Dose 
adjustments  (including  frequency  adjustments)  were  permitted  as  judged  clinically  appropriate  by  the 
investigator based on the subject’s ammonia-scavenging needs (e.g., severity of the UCD defect, dietary protein 
intake, and urinary phenylacetylglutamine [PAGN] excretion). 
Duration of treatment: open-ended, allowing subjects to remain in the study  until Ravicti was commercially 
available or available through the Health Canada Special Access Program. 
Concomitant medications: Medications used at the time of study initiation may have been continued with the 
permission of the investigator. All concomitant medications, including dose adjustments, and their indications 
were to be recorded on the CRF. Prohibited medications were not to be used during the study: drugs known to 
cause hyperammonaemia, such as valproate and drugs known to significantly affect renal clearance, such as 
probenecid. If any of these medications were needed for treatment of a study participant, the investigator, in 
conjunction with the medical monitor, was to discuss the feasibility of early termination. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The exploratory efficacy parameters were plasma ammonia concentrations and number of HACs. 
Routine study visits occurred every 6 months. Unscheduled visits may have occurred due to a hospitalization, a 
visit to the emergency room, or at the discretion of the investigator between routine study visits. The reason for 
the unscheduled visit was documented. 
Safety  assessments  included  monitoring  of  AEs  (including  HACs)  and  concomitant  medications,  amino  acid 
panels,  neuropsychological  tests,  physical  examinations,  vital  signs,  clinical  safety  laboratory  evaluations 
(complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis), and pregnancy testing (if applicable).

Subjects  underwent  physical  examinations  (including  height,  weight,  and  vital  sign  monitoring)  inclusive  of 
neurological  status,  and  blood  samples  were  collected  for  the  analysis  of  ammonia,  amino  acid  panels,  and 
routine clinical laboratory safety tests. If applicable, urine samples were collected for pregnancy testing. Blood 
samples  were  collected  for  the  assessment  of  plasma  ammonia  concentrations  at  baseline,  at  least  every  6 
months, at all unscheduled visits, and at the end of study participation. 
Neuropsychological tests included the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) for adult subjects and 
paediatric subjects who were at least 6 years of age. In addition, the grooved pegboard test, the California 
Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), and digit span tests were performed for adult subjects; the Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function® (BRIEF®) were performed 
for paediatric subjects at least 5 years of age. 
Neuropsychological tests were performed at baseline, every 12 months, and at the end of study participation.  
Endpoints: The primary endpoint was the rate of AEs. Secondary endpoints included venous ammonia levels, the 
number and causes of HACs, and neuropsychological test results. 
Statistical Methods 
Only one analysis population was evaluated for this study, the safety population. All subjects who received any 
amount of study medication were included in the safety population. Descriptive summary statistics [number of 
subjects (n), mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum] were presented for continuous 
variables, and frequencies and percentages were presented for categorical variables. Separate statistics were 
presented for adult (≥18 years), paediatric (<18 years), and the total number of subjects. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  88  subjects  (45  paediatric  and  43  adult)  were  enrolled;  77  subjects  (42  paediatric  and  35  adult) 
completed the study, 6 subjects withdrew from the study (3 subjects were lost-to-follow up, 1 subject withdrew 
from study participation, 1 subject relocated out of the country, and 1 subject underwent a liver transplantation 
procedure), and 5 subjects (1 paediatric and 4 adult) were ongoing at the Canadian site (at the time of this 
report).  Among  all  subjects,  the  median  duration  of  treatment  during  HPN-100-011  was  674.0  days 
(approximately 1.85 years), and the median total duration of treatment in all Ravicti studies (i.e., including 
feeder studies) was 1036.0 days (approximately 2.84 years). 
6  subjects  (2  paediatric  and  4  adult)  were  enrolled  in  Canada  from  Site  07;  1  of  the  paediatric  subjects 
completed the study, and the 5 remaining subjects (1 paediatric and 4 adult) are presented below as data from 
the addendum to the main report.

All 5 subjects (1 paediatric and 4 adult) who were ongoing at the time of the final CSR completed the study. 
Among these 5 subjects, the median duration of treatment during HPN-100-011 was 5.45 years, and the median 
total duration of treatment in all Ravicti studies (i.e., including feeder studies) was 6.51 years.  
Baseline data 
A total of 45 paediatric subjects between the ages of 1 and 17 years (median of 7.0 years) and 43 adult subjects 
between the ages of 19 and 61 years (median of 30.0 years) were enrolled. The majority of the subjects in each 
age group were female (≥60%), White (≥83%), and of non-Hispanic ethnicity (≥82%). 
The study population included subjects diagnosed with UCD as neonates (24 subjects; 27.3%), as infants (18 
subjects; 20.5%), and as children (>2 years) or adults (46 subjects; 52.3%). The majority of the subjects in 
both  age  groups  (57.8%  paediatric  and  81.4%  adult)  had  OTC  deficiency.  The  most  common  method  of 
diagnosis  was  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  mutational  analysis  (46.6%),  followed  by  amino  acid  analysis 
(27.3%). Of the 88 enrolled subjects, 82 (93.2%) were receiving NaPBA at the time of entry in the initial Ravicti 
studies. 
- Data from addendum to Study HPN-100-011 
The 5 subjects comprised one 14-year-old paediatric subject who was female and 4 adult subjects (2 male, 2 
female) between the ages of 21 and 33 years (median of 23.5 years). Two subjects were Asian (1 paediatric, 1 
adult) and 3 adult subjects were white. 
Exploratory Efficacy results 
Continued ammonia control was observed with long-term dosing of Ravicti. Mean ammonia levels remained 
stable and below the adult upper limit of normal (ULN) (<35 μmol/L; Chernecky 2013) through 24 months of 
treatment in both the paediatric and adult groups; too few subjects were dosed beyond 24 months to draw 
meaningful conclusions. Of note, a single paediatric subject continued treatment past 30 months and remained 
below the paediatric ULN of 57 μmol/L (Chernecky 2013). The proportions of paediatric subjects with ammonia 
samples above the paediatric ULN at each scheduled time point up through 24 months of treatment (range: 
8.7% to 17.4%) and at the End of Study assessment (17.9%) were comparable to baseline (13.6%).  
Continued ammonia control with long-term Ravicti dosing was associated with fewer HACs. Overall, the number 
of  subjects  with  HAC  during  this  continued-access  study  was  lower  (22.7%;  43  crises)  compared  with  the 
12-month  period  prior  to  enrolment  in  Ravicti  studies  during  treatment  with  NaPBA  (30.7%;  49  crises).  In 
particular, the decrease in the number of subjects with HAC was most evident among paediatric subjects who 
demonstrated a 42% decrease (42.2% [35 crises] pre-enrolment vs. 24.4% [22 crises] continued access). The 
annualized rate of HAC per paediatric subject decreased from 0.78 crises per year during the 12-month period 
prior to enrolment in Ravicti studies while receiving NaPBA, to 0.36 and 0.42 crises per year, respectively, in the 
12-month  safety  extension  studies  and  this  continued-access  study,  demonstrating  the  durability  of  the 
response.  Results  for  the  adults  showed  an  increase  in  the  annualized  rate  of  HAC  per  subject  during  this 
continued-access  study  (0.58  crises  per  year)  compared  with  the  12-month  safety  extension  studies  (0.21

crises per year); however, this increase was attributable to a single subject who experienced 2 crises during 45 
days of participation in the study resulting in an annualized rate of 15.9 crises per year for this subject. 
The  most  commonly  reported  precipitating  factors  for  HAC  experienced  during  this  continued-access  study 
included intercurrent illness (23.3%; 6 paediatric and 4 adult subjects), infection (14%; 6 paediatric subjects), 
and noncompliance with study drug (14%; 2 paediatric and 4 adult subjects). 
- Exploratory efficacy data from the addendum to Study HPN-100-011 
Mean normalized ammonia levels remained below the ULN for the majority of time points through 66 months of 
treatment in the 4 adult subjects. The normalized ammonia level for the single paediatric subject was below the 
paediatric ULN at all time points. One adult subject experienced a HAC during this continued-access study; the 
precipitating factor was lack of adherence to diet. 
CHMP comments 
In this long term open label safety study, continued ammonia control for adults and children for a duration 
of  almost  2  years  was  observed.  Mean  ammonia  levels  remained  stable  and  below  the  adult  ULN  up 
through 24 months of treatment in both the paediatric and adult groups. In addition, a reduced number 
of subjects with HAC compared with the 12-month period prior to enrolment in Ravicti studies during 
treatment  with  NaPBA  was  documented.  This  reduction  was  more  evident  for  paediatric  patients.  For 
paediatric patients the annualized rate of HAC also decreased.  
The SmPC of Ravicti in section 5.1 describes paediatric data under two sub headings: “clinical studies in 
paediatric patients with UCDs” AND “open-label, uncontrolled, extension studies in paediatric patients”. 
In the latter section, long term, 12-month data are described as:  
“Long-term (12-month), uncontrolled, open-label studies were conducted to assess monthly ammonia 
control  and  hyperammonaemic  crisis  over  a  12-month  period  in  three  studies  (Study  2,  which  also 
enrolled adults, and extensions of Studies 3 and 4). A total of 49 children ages 2 months to 17 years with 
deficiencies of OTC, ASS, ASL, and ARG were enrolled, and all but 1 had been converted from sodium 
phenylbutyrate  to  glycerol  phenylbutyrate.  Mean  fasting  venous  ammonia  values  were  within  normal 
limits  during  long-term treatment  with  glycerol phenylbutyrate  (range:  17-25  micromol/L).  Of  the  49 
paediatric patients who participated in these extension studies, 12 patients (25 %) reported a total of 17 
hyperammonaemic crises during treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate as compared with 38 crises in 21 
patients (43 %) in the preceding 12 months prior to study entry,  while they  were being treated with 
sodium phenylbutyrate.” 
Study HPN-100-011 provides much longer data for the same patients who were also included in previous 
open label extension studies than those presented in the SmPC. The MAH concludes in the study report: 
“As compared to the 12 months preceding enrolment in Ravicti studies (while subjects were being treated 
with NaPBA), the decreased rate of HAC while receiving Ravicti was most pronounced in the paediatric 
subjects. This is particularly noteworthy as paediatric patients are the most vulnerable to crises and are 
at risk of sustaining permanent developmental damage as a result of high ammonia.” AND “Given the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/415422/2018 
Page 9/16 
  
  
serious  consequences  of  high  ammonia  levels,  these  findings  are  clinically  relevant  in  the  UCD 
population”. It is agreed that these data are clinically relevant as the main objective of treatment in UCD 
patients is maintaining normal ammonia levels and preventing HACs with an aim to reduce the incidence 
of serious acute complications such as encephalopathy, coma, and death, and chronic complications such 
as brain damage.  
Based on the above, the MAH should update the paragraph in section 5.1 of the SmPC that presents data 
from “open-label, uncontrolled, extension studies in paediatric patients”. This SmPC update should reflect 
the duration of the extension studies (with study HPN-100-011 currently being the longest completed 
study), the sustained ammonia control and effect on number of HACs. 
Safety results 
Long-term exposure to Ravicti was well tolerated in this continued-access study. Median duration of treatment 
among all subjects was 674.0 days (approximately 1.85 years).  
Dose  adjustments  were  common,  especially  for  paediatric  subjects  (44.4%  of  paediatric  vs.  25.6%  of  adult 
subjects  had  at  least  1  dose  adjustment).  The  most  common  reasons  for  dose  adjustments  were 
growth/increase in weight (13 paediatric and 2 adult subjects) and elevated glutamine level (5 paediatric and 5 
adult subjects). Elevated glutamine levels in UCD patients have been associated with symptoms, and glutamine 
is used by some clinicians to assess ammonia control. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  reported  in  ≥10%  of  adults  were  hyperammonaemia  [25.6%],  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  [18.6%],  diarrhoea  [16.3%],  ammonia  increased  [14.0%],  vomiting  [11.6%], 
bronchitis  [11.6%],  and  convulsion  [11.6%].  TEAEs  reported  in  ≥ 10%  of  paediatric  subjects  were 
hyperammonaemia  [22.2%],  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  [15.6%],  vomiting  [13.3%],  and  headache 
[13.3%].  These  are  consistent  with  the  TEAEs  reported  in  the  12-month  safety  extension  studies  and 
comparable  to  the  adverse  reactions  occurring  in  ≥10%  of  paediatric  patients  (upper  abdominal  pain,  rash, 
nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite,  hyperammonaemia,  and  headache)  in  the  current  Ravicti 
prescribing information. Among the TEAEs reported, diarrhoea (16.3% vs. 6.7%), bronchitis (11.6% and 2.2%), 
and convulsion (11.6% vs. 0%) occurred more frequently in adults than in paediatric subjects. No consistent 
increase in the overall incidence of TEAEs or for those events reported in ≥10% of adult or paediatric subjects 
was observed with prolonged Ravicti exposure. 
Overall, the majority of the subjects reporting TEAEs had events that were considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to study drug. TEAEs considered related to study drug were reported in 25.0% of all subjects, with 
comparable rates among adults (23.3%) and paediatric subjects (26.7%). TEAEs considered related to study 
drug reported in >1 paediatric subject were amino acid level decreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, 
and headache (2 paediatric subjects each; 4.4%). The only TEAE considered related to study drug reported in 
>1 adult subject was hypoesthesia (2 adult subjects; 4.7%).

Most  of  the  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  had  events  that  were  considered  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  One 
life-threatening  TEAE  of  localized  infection  of  the  left  great  toe  was  reported  in  an  adult  subject  that  was 
considered not related to study drug but likely due to an insect bite. TEAEs considered severe were reported in 
26.1%  of  all  subjects,  and  were  more  commonly  observed  in  adults  (32.6%)  than  in  paediatric  subjects 
(20.0%). The only severe TEAE reported in >1 paediatric subject was hyperammonaemia (6 paediatric subjects; 
13.3%). Severe TEAEs reported in >1 adult subject were hyperammonaemia (7 adult subjects; 16.3%) and 
abdominal  pain  (3  adult  subjects;  7.0%).  None  of  the  severe  TEAEs  reported  in  paediatric  subjects  were 
considered related to study drug. Two adult subjects experienced severe TEAEs considered possibly related to 
study drug (weight decreased and hypocapnia.  
No subject died during the study. Treatment-emergent serious AEs (TESAEs) were more commonly observed in 
adults  (41.9%)  than  in  paediatric  subjects  (26.7%).  TESAEs  reported  in  >1  paediatric  subject  were 
hyperammonaemia (10 subjects; 22.2%) and dehydration (2 subjects; 4.4%). TESAEs reported in >1 adult 
subject were hyperammonaemia (11 subjects; 25.6%) and abdominal pain (3 subjects; 7.0%). Of all TESAEs 
reported during the study, only 2 were considered possibly related to study drug (hypocapnia in 1 adult subject 
and hyponatremia in 1 adult subject).  
The overall incidence of TEAEs (93.0% vs. 75.6%) and TESAEs (41.9% vs. 26.7%) were more frequent in adult 
subjects than in paediatric subjects. 3 subjects had TEAEs with an action taken of drug withdrawn: pancreatitis 
in  1  adult  subject,  hypocapnia  in  1  adult  subject,  and  pancytopenia  and  hyperammonaemia  in  1  paediatric 
subject. 
- Safety data from the addendum to Study HPN-100-011 
Long-term exposure to Ravicti was well tolerated by the 5 subjects. Median duration of treatment among all 
subjects was 5.45 years. No subject died, experienced a life-threatening treatment-emergent adverse event 
(TEAE), or prematurely discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. 
The  majority  of  the  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  had  events  that  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
unrelated to study drug. TEAEs considered related to study drug reported for the paediatric subject were the 
non-serious events of alopecia and madarosis (reported previously in the final CSR), both mild in severity, and 
the  non-serious  event  of  blood  potassium  decreased,  moderate  in  severity  (reported  previously  in  the  final 
CSR). One adult subject reported a TEAE (arthritis, moderate in severity) considered related to study drug. 
Hyperammonaemia, an expected adverse reaction, was the only TEAE reported in more than 1 of the 5 subjects 
(1 paediatric subject, 1 adult subject). The event was serious in both of these subjects, but considered by the 
investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  drug  and  due  to  noncompliance  with  diet.  The  only  other 
treatment-emergent  SAE  was  hypokalaemia  in  the  paediatric  subject;  this  event  was  considered  by  the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug and due to noncompliance with medication. 
CHMP comments: 
The type and frequency of AEs documented for paediatric patients in this trial are consistent with the AEs 
mentioned in the product information. Treatment-emergent serious AEs were more commonly observed

in adults than in paediatric subjects.  
Overall, treatment with the drug for an extended period was well tolerated by children and adults. A low 
number of subjects prematurely withdrew over the course of the study (6.8%). There were no deaths. No 
new safety concerns were identified.  
Neuropsychological tests results 
The MAH has not presented these results in their overview.  
CHMP comments:  
Currently the Ravicti SmPC only mentions the following regarding neurological impairment in patients 
with  UCDs,  in  section  5.1:  “Reversal  of  the  pre-existing  neurological  impairment  is  unlikely  following 
treatment and neurological deterioration may continue in some patients.” 
The  duration  of  hyperammonaemia  and  the  peak  level  of  ammonia  correlate  with  brain  damage  and 
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Theoretically, effective treatment may improve neurocognitive outcomes 
in children with UCDs or at least prevent further deterioration. It may be difficult to draw a conclusion 
about neurocognitive outcomes and any effect of Ravicti on those based on data from an uncontrolled 
study, in a small population with different UCDs and different disease onset, concomitant medications and 
other confounding factors. However, the MAH should provide a short overview and critical discussion of 
neuropsychologic findings in children enrolled in this study. Based on this discussion, the MAH should 
propose, if needed, SmPC amendments to include the results of neuropsychological tests in children.   
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  this  long-term  safety  extension  Study,  Ravicti  was  effective  in  maintain  ammonia  control  in  adult  and 
paediatric UCD subjects for up to 24 months and in some patients for much longer. In addition, as compared to 
the  12  months  preceding  enrolment  in  Ravicti  studies  (while  subjects  were  being  treated  with  NaPBA),  a 
decreased rate of HAC while receiving Ravicti was observed which was most pronounced in paediatric subjects. 
Given the importance of sustaining ammonia control in UCD patients, the MAH should update the paragraph in 
section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  that  presents  data  from  “open-label,  uncontrolled,  extension  studies  in  paediatric 
patients”.  This  SmPC  update  should  reflect  the  duration  of  the  extension  studies  (with  study  HPN-100-011 
currently being the longest completed study), the sustained ammonia control and effect on number of HACs. 
Long-term treatment with Ravicti was well tolerated. There were no deaths. The safety profile in both children 
and  adults  was  consistent  with  the  AEs  mentioned  in  the  product  information.  No  new  safety  findings  were 
revealed.  
The MAH did not present an overview of findings from the neurophysiological tests conducted in children. The 
MAH should provide a short overview and critical discussion of neuropsychologic findings in children enrolled in

this study.  Based on this  discussion, the MAH should propose, if needed, SmPC amendments to include the 
results of neuropsychological tests in children.    
3.  CHMP preliminary conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH concluded that “the information gained with the submitted paediatric study does not influence the 
benefit risk for Ravicti. There is no consequential regulatory action; no changes or amendments of the product 
information are proposed.” 
Based on the submitted study and the addendum to this study, the benefit:risk ratio of Ravicti in the paediatric 
population remains unchanged.  
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure. (See 
section “Additional clarification requested”) 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure: 
1.  The MAH should propose SmPC wording to update the paragraph in section 5.1 that presents data from 
“open-label, uncontrolled, extension studies in paediatric patients”. This SmPC update should reflect the 
duration  of  the  extension  studies  (with  study  HPN-100-011  currently  being  the  longest  completed 
study), the sustained ammonia control and effect on number of HACs. 
2.  The MAH should provide a short overview and critical discussion of neuropsychologic findings in children 
enrolled in this study. Based on this discussion, the MAH should propose, if needed, SmPC amendments 
to include the results of neuropsychological tests in children.   
5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The  MAH  should  propose  SmPC  wording  to  update  the  paragraph  in  section  5.1  that  presents 
data from “open-label, uncontrolled, extension studies in paediatric patients”. This  SmPC update 
should reflect the duration of the extension studies (with study HPN-100-011 currently being the 
longest completed study), the sustained ammonia control and effect on number of HACs. 
Comment MAH: 
As recommended, the following text has been proposed to be added to SmPC Section 5.1 (Study 5 is used to 
refer to Study HPN-100-011):

An open-label, long-term study (Study 5) was conducted to assess ammonia control in paediatric patients with 
UCD. The study enrolled a total of 45 paediatric patients between the ages of 1 and 17 years with UCD who had 
completed Study 2 and the safety extensions of Studies 3 and 4. The length of study participation ranged from 
0.2  to  5.9  years.  Venous  ammonia  levels  were  monitored  at  a  minimum  of  every  6  months.  Mean  venous 
ammonia  values  in  paediatric  patients  in  Study  5  were  within  normal  limits  during  long-term  (24  months) 
treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate (range: 15-25 micromol/L). Of the 45 paediatric patients participating in 
the  open-label  treatment  with  glycerol  phenylbutyrate,  11  patients  (24%)  reported  a  total  of  22 
hyperammonemic crises. 
CHMP comments:  
The MAH has proposed wording for section 5.1 of the SmPC to include the results of this study. The text 
proposed is acceptable.  
2.The MAH should provide a short overview and critical discussion of neuropsychologic findings in 
children enrolled in this study. Based on this discussion, the MAH should propose, if needed, SmPC 
amendments to include the results of neuropsychological tests in children. 
Comment MAH: 
Among urea cycle disorders (UCD), neonatal onset and prolonged hyperammonemic coma predict impairment of 
future  neurocognitive  performance.  The  duration  and  severity  of  hyperammonemia  correlate  with  brain 
damage.  Thus,  prompt  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  UCD  is  essential  in  order  to  optimise  the  outcome. 
Pre-existing  neurological  damage  appears  not  to  reverse  and,  in  fact,  even  though  liver  transplantation  is 
considered curative as far as enzyme deficiencies are concerned and allows termination of the low-protein diet 
and regular alternative pathway therapy, it does not reverse established neurological sequelae (Häberle J et al, 
2012).  
For study HPN-100-011: “Long-Term Use of HPN-100 in Urea Cycle Disorders”, neuropsychological tests were 
performed  at  baseline,  every  12  months,  and  at  the  end  of  study  participation  and  included  the  Wechsler 
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) for adult and paediatric subjects who were at least 6 years of age. In 
addition, the grooved pegboard test, the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), and digit 
span  tests  were  performed  for  adult  subjects;  the  Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL)  and  the  Behavior  Rating 
Inventory of Executive Function® (BRIEF®) were performed for paediatric subjects at least 5 years of age.  
The results did not demonstrate any significant neuropsychological change from baseline to months 12, 24 or 
end of study. These data are consistent with information outlined in the RAVICTI SmPC illustrating that reversal 
of the pre-existing neurological impairment is unlikely to occur following treatment with RAVICTI. 
Given these results, the MAH does not favour SmPC amendment. 
CHMP comments:  
As stated by the MAH, the duration and severity of hyperammonaemia correlate with brain damage. On 
the  other  hand,  phenylacetic  acid  (PAA),  the  active  metabolite  of  glycerol  phenylbutyrate,  is  also 
associated with signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity, although this has not been documented in clinical 
trials  with  Ravicti.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  overview  and  critical  discussion  of  the 
neuropsychological results in children enrolled in this study. In response to this request, the MAH stated

that no significant neuropsychological changes were observed.  
Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  contains  the  following  text:  “Reversal  of  the  pre-existing  neurological 
impairment is unlikely following treatment and neurological deterioration may continue in some patients.” 
Considering the limitations of this long-term, open label uncontrolled study and that no significant effects 
on neurocognition in either direction were found, it is considered that no useful information regarding 
neurocognitive impairment can be added to the SmPC further to the existing text.  
The MAH’s proposal not to amend the SmPC with regards to neuropsychological findings from this study 
is acceptable.

6.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted the final report and addendum of study HPN-100-011 for glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti), 
according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.   
Based on the submitted study and the addendum to this study, the benefit:risk ratio of Ravicti in the paediatric 
population remains unchanged.  
  Fulfilled 
In addition, the SmPC of Ravicti should be amended in section 5.1 to include a summary of this open label, 
long-term safety study. The following is proposed:  
Section 5.1  
Paediatric population 
…. 
An open-label, long-term study (Study 5) was conducted to assess ammonia control in paediatric 
patients with UCD. The study enrolled a total of 45 paediatric patients between the ages of 1 and 17 
years with UCD who had completed Study 2 and the safety extensions of Studies 3 and 4. The length 
of study participation ranged from 0.2 to 5.9 years. Venous ammonia levels were monitored at a 
minimum of every 6 months. Mean venous ammonia values in paediatric patients in Study 5 were 
within normal limits during long-term (24 months) treatment with glycerol phenylbutyrate (range: 
15-25  micromol/L).  Of  the  45  paediatric  patients  participating  in  the  open-label  treatment  with 
glycerol phenylbutyrate, 11 patients (24%) reported a total of 22 hyperammonemic crises. 
The MAH should submit a Type II variation to amend the product information within 60 days after adoption of the 
CHMP conclusion. If the MAH is unable to submit the variation within this timeframe, they must justify the delay 
and inform the EMA/Rapporteur and propose a new submission date.

Marketing authorisation procedure: 
Centralised 
Brief description of the product: 
Hyperlink to the Product Information: 
Indication(s) in the EEA: 
Chemical class: Second-generation, Class III RTK 
inhibitor 
Summary of mode of action: 
Quizartinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the 
RTK FLT3.  Quizartinib and its active metabolite 
AC886 competitively bind to the adenosine 
triphosphate binding pocket of FLT3 with high 
affinity (Kd = 1.3 and 0.54 nM, respectively).  
Quizartinib and AC886 inhibit FLT3 kinase 
activity, preventing autophosphorylation of the 
receptor, thereby inhibiting further downstream 
FLT3 receptor signalling and FLT3-ITD-dependent 
cell proliferation. 
Important information about its composition: 
Quizartinib is available as 17.7- and 26.5-mg 
film-coated tablets.  Each 17.7-mg film-coated 
tablet contains 17.7 mg quizartinib (as 
dihydrochloride).  Each 26.5-mg film-coated tablet 
contains 26.5 mg quizartinib (as dihydrochloride). 
VANFLYTA (quizartinib) Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) 
VANFLYTA is indicated in combination with 
standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction 
and standard cytarabine consolidation 
chemotherapy, followed by VANFLYTA single 
agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with 
newly diagnosed AML that is FLT3-ITD positive.

VANFLYTA should be administered at 35.4 mg 
QD for 2 weeks in each cycle of consolidation 
chemotherapy followed by VANFLYTA 
continuation monotherapy initiated at 26.5 mg QD.  
After 2 weeks the continuation dose should be 
increased to 53 mg QD if QTcF is ≤450 ms (see 
SmPC Section 4.4).  Continuation therapy may be 
continued for up to 36 cycles (SmPC Table 1). 
For patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors 
concomitantly, the dose should be reduced.  See

PART II   SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION AND 
TARGET POPULATION 
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 
The epidemiology of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is summarised below.  Given that the 
quizartinib development programme included studies in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) 
AML and that data presented in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) include both subjects with 
newly diagnosed (ND) and R/R AML (see Section Part II: Module SIII), epidemiology data on 
R/R AML are presented for completeness.   
Incidence and Prevalence 
AML is the most common acute leukaemia in adults; according to the United States (US) 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (2020), 33% of all leukaemia cases 
are AML.  GLOBOCAN estimates the worldwide total leukaemia incidence of AML for 2020 to 
Page 9 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
be 474,519, with an age-standardised rate of 6.3 and 4.5 per 100,000 for males and females, 
respectively.   
Europe: In Europe, an estimated 22,250 new cases of AML are diagnosed each year, consisting 
of approximately 0.6% of all cancers and representing 30% of all leukaemia cases in adults.  The 
annual incidence rate of AML is between 3 and 4 per 100,000 in Europe.  For the European 
Union (EU) 28, the estimated number of new AML cases in 2013 was 19,819, and the crude 
annual incidence rate was 3.5 per 100,000 (based on 2000 to 2007 data).  In a recent study 
involving the Global Health Data Exchange database, the estimated annual incidence rates of 
AML across Europe were lower than older estimates.  The age-adjusted AML incidence rates for 
Central, Eastern, and Western Europe were 1.56, 1.39, and 2.5 per 100,000, respectively (2017 
data).  Based on 2008 data, there were an estimated 53,486 persons living with AML in the EU, 
and the 5-year prevalence estimate was 4.10 per 100,000.   
According to NORDCAN the overall crude incidence of AML in Scandinavia from 2012 to 2016 
was 2.9 and 2.6 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. In Burgundy, France, the 
overall crude incidence was reported to be 2.5 per 100,000 (2.8 in males vs. 2.2 in females) 
whereas in Switzerland, the overall crude incidence was 3.8 per 100,000 (4.1 in males vs. 3.4 in 
females).  In Sweden, the reported crude incidence increased from 4.7 (1997 to 1996) to 5.3 
(2007 to 2015) per 100,000, resulting in an annual increase of 1.2%.  Based on 2008 data, there 
were an estimated 53,486 persons living with AML in the EU, and the 5-year prevalence 
estimate was 4.10 per 100,000.  In Scandinavia alone, the overall prevalence of AML in 2014 
was estimated to 13.9 per 100,000 from Swedish registry data (1997 to 2013).  
United Kingdom: There were 3164 new AML cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK) in 
2017.  Of these, approximately 1700 were in males, and 1300 were in females.  AML accounts 
for <1% of all new cancers in the UK.  Since the early 1990s, AML incidence rates have 
increased by 20% in the UK.  The increase is similar in males (19%) and females (16%).  The 
lifetime risk of AML diagnosis is 1 in 200 in men and 1 in 255 in women.  An estimated 
6100 people who had previously been diagnosed with AML were alive in the UK at the end of 
2010.  Age-adjusted incidence rates of AML by sex in the UK are presented in Table Part II: 
Module SI.1.  The 5- and 10-year prevalence estimates are not readily available for the UK.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
AML diagnosed between 1997 and 2015. Of these, female patients with AML accounted for 
44.7% of all cases whereas male patients accounted for 55.3%.  
United States: US SEER estimates the number of new AML cases for 2020 to be 19,940, which 
represents 1.1% of all new cancer cases in the US.  The 5-year prevalence of AML in the US is 
25,363, and the 10-year prevalence is 11,650.  The lifetime risk of developing AML in the US is 
approximately 0.5%.  As of 2018, there was an estimated 66,988 people living with AML in the 
US.

Japan: The incidence of AML has been increasing in Japan since 1993 (Monitoring of Cancer 
Incidence in Japan project).  In 2008, there were 1477 new AML cases reported from 
16 prefectures.  The age-adjusted overall incidence rate was 1.9 per 100,000 (2.99 per 100,000 
among males and 1.87 per 100,000 among females). 
Feline McDonough sarcoma-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) 
mutations: Mutation of FLT3 can be found in up to 30% of patients with AML (FLT3- ITD 
accounts for approximately 20% and FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain [TKD] mutations in up to 
10% of AML).  In cytogenetically normal AML, this proportion can be as high as 42% 
Page 11 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
(31% FLT3-ITD and 11% FLT3-TKD mutations).  FLT3-ITD is associated with poorer 
prognosis and survival, especially in normal karyotype AML (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 8.8; P  = 0.03).  FLT3-ITD is less common in children than 
in adults (13% to 16%).  In a pooled analysis of 1722 subjects aged 0 to 60 years, FLT3-ITD 
mutations were found among 13% of subjects with AML <15 years, 19% in subjects 15 to 39 
years, 23% in subjects >40 years, and 27% in subjects >65 years.  
The incidence of FLT3-ITD mutations decreases with age, with an incidence of up to 35% in 
patients between 20 and 59 years compared with 16% to 20% in patients >60 years.  In a 
retrospective pooled analysis of 1321 adult subjects treated by the German AML Cooperative 
Group and 148 paediatric subjects treated by the AML-Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster study group, 
the median age of FLT3-ITD positive subjects was significantly lower compared with subjects 
with wild-type FLT3 (55 vs. 61 years; P < 0.001).  
The incidence of R/R AML is defined on the basis of the number of subjects whose AML has 
relapsed following initial remission (relapsed AML) or on the number of subjects who do not 
achieve an initial remission following induction therapy (refractory AML).  These numbers vary 
depending on the type of induction therapy regimen used to achieve the initial remission.  Broad 
estimates on the incidence of R/R AML based on the available data are provided below. 
Overall, 10% to 40% of patients with ND AML do not achieve complete remission (CR) after 
induction therapy and are defined as primary refractory or resistant cases.  With induction 
chemotherapy consisting of 3 days of anthracycline and 7 days of cytarabine (commonly referred 
to as “7 + 3” regimen), CR is achieved in 60% to 80% of younger adults and in 40% to 60% of 
older adults (60 years or older).  With high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC)-containing induction 
regimens, 894 subjects with AML (61%) achieved CR, and 285 subjects with AML (19%) were 
refractory to the first cycle of induction.  Among the 285 subjects who were refractory to initial 
induction therapy, 197 received salvage therapy, and only 35 (18%) achieved CR after salvage 
therapy.  Other induction regimens (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide and fludarabine, 
cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], and idarubicin [FLAG-Ida]) have 
been associated with lower rates of primary refractory disease, with 82% and 84% of subjects 
achieving CR, compared with 76% of subjects receiving cytarabine and daunorubicin.  
Relapse can be expected in nearly all patients with AML who initially achieve CR, unless 
postremission therapy is given.  The goal of postremission therapy is to eliminate any residual, 
undetectable disease and achieve a cure.  Consolidation chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) are the 2 options for postremission therapy.  Even with 
postremission therapy, patients with AML experience relapse.  In prospective studies, subjects 
<55 years of age who were in the first CR received consolidation therapy with allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation (alloSCT), autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT), or chemotherapy, 
with 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 43% to 55% for alloSCT, 35% to 54% for 
autoSCT, and only 30% to 40% for chemotherapy.  For patients with very poor prognostic 
factors, the risk of relapse following consolidation by chemotherapy or by autoSCT or alloSCT 
ranges from 90% for chemotherapy and 40% to 50% for autoSCT or alloSCT.  For patients with 
favourable prognostic factors, the risk of relapse following consolidation by chemotherapy, or by 
autoSCT or alloSCT, ranges from 35% to 40% for chemotherapy and 15% to 20% for autoSCT 
or alloSCT.

Demographics of the Target Population 
AML is more common in older adults and among men compared with women.  In both Europe 
and the US, AML incidence rates increase with age, with the highest incidence among those ≥65 
years of age.  Among children, the highest incidence rate is observed among infants <1 year of 
age.  Each year, 42% of all new AML cases in the UK are diagnosed in people ≥75 years old.  
Additionally, incidence rates for AML in the UK are highest in patients aged 85 to 89 years.  In a 
report of incidence rates of leukaemia by ethnic group in England during 2002 to 2006, the Black 
ethnic group had statistically significantly higher incidence rates across all age groups.  
In the US, the median age at diagnosis is 68 years, and the majority (58.9%) of all AML patients 
are diagnosed at age ≥65 years.  Based on 2013 to 2017 data, incidence rates of AML vary across 
race/ethnic groups, with White patients having the highest rate, followed by Black, Hispanic, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native patients.  That pattern holds 
regardless of sex.  The percentage of new cases by age group based on SEER data from 2013 to 
2017 is presented in Table Part II: Module SI.3.

Risk Factors 
Risk factors for developing AML can be broadly described in 2 categories: non-patient-related 
risk factors and patient-related risk factors. 
Non-patient-related Risk Factors 
Physical and chemical exposures: Certain solvents, such as benzene, used in the rubber industry, 
oil refineries, chemical plants, and other industries and found in cigarette smoke, gasoline, 
combustion and cleaning products, and paints are identified as risk factors for developing AML.  
Other chemicals that can increase the risk of AML include herbicides, pesticides, or embalming 
fluids.  Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for developing AML among adults.  Parental smoking 
has also been found to be a risk factor for childhood leukaemia.  In 2011, 14.6% of 9047 deaths 
among patients with AML were attributed to cigarette smoking (23% deaths among males and 
Page 13 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
3% among females).  In a pooled analysis of 9 cohort studies in Japan, cigarette smoking was 
found to increase risk for AML among the Asian population.  For both sexes combined, current 
smokers had a marginally significant increased risk of AML compared to never smokers (HR = 
1.44; 95% CI = 0.97, 2.14).  Ever smokers with more than 30 pack-years had a statistically 
significant increased risk of AML compared with never smokers among both sexes combined 
(HR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.06, 2.63).  
Radiation exposure: High-dose radiation exposure (eg, nuclear plant accident) increases the 
chance of developing AML.  Therapeutic radiation for cancer treatment has also been reported to 
increase the risk of developing secondary AML.  
Therapy-related or previous haematologic disease-related AML (secondary AML): 
Approximately 5% of AML cases are therapy related.  Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and 
mechlorethamine), platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin), and topoisomerase II inhibitors 
(etoposide or doxorubicin) have been linked to increased risk of AML developing following 
treatment of a primary malignancy.  Latency varies with AML therapy, developing as early as 2 
years after treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and up to 5 to 8 years after therapy with 
alkylating agents.  There is a female predominance of therapy-related AML, primarily because of 
chemotherapy for female cancers.  The proportion of secondary AML due to cytotoxic therapy 
and secondary myelodysplasia increases with age.  
Patient-related Risk Factors 
Age: Leukaemia occurs mostly in adults, and the risk of AML diagnosis increases with age, with 
the highest rates occurring among those ≥65 years of age.  The progression of myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) to AML in older people might explain the increased incidence of AML and 
poor survival among the elderly, as AML in this age group shares characteristic risk factors for 
MDS in terms of abnormal cytogenetics, Fanconi anaemia, or alkylating agent therapy.  
Sex and race/ethnicity: The incidence of AML differs by sex and ethnicity.  Slight male 
predominance can be found for AML in adults for most countries, including the US and Europe.  
Similarly, White subjects seem to have higher rates of AML when compared with other races. 
Blood disorders/MDS: Blood disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders (eg, polycythaemia 
vera) or essential thrombocythaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis have increased risk of AML.  
People with MDS may also develop AML.  In a retrospective analysis of the SEER database, Ye 
et al found that the rate of secondary AML from MDS was 3.7% among patients ≤40 years and 
2.5% among those >40 years old (P = 0.039).  
Genetic disorders: Children with Down syndrome have a 10- to 20-fold increased likelihood of 
developing acute leukaemia.  Other inherited diseases associated with AML include Klinefelter 
syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Fanconi anaemia, Patau syndrome, Ataxia telangiectasia, 
Shwachman syndrome, Kostman syndrome, and neurofibromatosis.  
Genes: There are several genes and associated genetic syndromes that predisposes the carrier to 
developing AML.  Recently identified genes include CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6, DDX41, 
ANKRD26, SAMD9, and SAMD9L.  In some conditions (eg, familial AML with CEBPA 
mutation), AML is the primary manifestation.  In other conditions (eg, thrombocytopenia 5), 
AML occurs secondary to thrombocytopenia.  In Emberger and MIRAGE syndrome, MDS 
occurs prior to AML.

Quizartinib 
Risk stratification: A number of genetic factors that predict the EFS and overall survival (OS) in 
AML have been identified (Table Part II: Module SI.4).  These genetic factors are important 
prognostic factors for AML as treatment is often dictated by the risk categories that genetic 
factors fall under.

A number of risk factors have been established to predict the development of R/R disease as well 
as EFS and OS in AML patients.  These include patient-related factors such as age, performance 
status, general health, specific comorbidities that modulate the effect of age on tolerance of 
chemotherapy, and AML-related factors (white cell count, prior MDS or cytotoxic therapy for 
another disorder, and leukaemic cell genetic changes including alterations in FLT3) that predict 
resistance to current standard therapy. 
  Age: Older age seems to act as an adverse prognostic marker even in younger AML 
patients.  A population-based retrospective study from the UK including 11,303 subjects 
with AML diagnosed from 2001 to 2006 reported an estimated 5-year OS rate of 15%, 
which varied according to the age at diagnosis; OS (%) by age group (years): 15 to 24: 
53%; 25 to 39: 49%; 40 to 59: 33%; 60 to 69: 13%; 70 to 79: 3%; >80 years: 0%.  
 
Intensity of conditioning regimen: Many AML patients are not considered candidates for 
conventional myeloablative conditioning procedures before transplant because of 
advanced age, previous therapies, or comorbidities.  Reduced intensity conditioning 
(RIC) was adopted to reduce early nonrelapse mortality in AML patients.  However, this 
is associated with a higher rate of relapse.  A retrospective study by the European Group 
for Blood and Marrow Transplantation found that the cumulative incidence of relapse 
was 23% for subjects receiving myeloablative conditioning versus 39% for subjects 
receiving RIC during 7-year follow-up.  
  FLT3-ITD mutation status: Among disease-specific risk factors, the presence of 
FLT3-ITD has been proposed as one of the most important prognostic factors in AML for 
the duration of CR and relapse-free survival.  A retrospective cohort study involving 
171 subjects with AML who underwent FLT3-ITD mutation testing reported that 
FLT3-mutated AML was associated with nearly twice the risk of relapse compared with 
those without FLT3 mutation 3 years after HSCT (63% vs. 37%, respectively).  
Consistent with the role of FLT3-ITD as a driver mutation, outcomes for these patients 
seem to be correlated with the FLT3-ITD allelic burden, expressed as FLT3 mutant to 
wild-type ratio or as the percentage of total alleles.  Accordingly, a high allelic burden is 
the best predictor of FLT3 inhibition (and, correspondingly, prognosis after FLT3 
targeted therapy), and a low allelic burden has a similar prognosis to FLT3 wild type.  
FLT3-ITD presents with high leukaemic burden (ie, leukocytosis, with high infiltration of 
the bone marrow), has poor prognosis, and has a significant negative impact on the 
management of patients with AML.  Of the AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations, 
only approximately 26% are expected to be alive after 5 years, and their condition is 
3 times more likely to relapse within 2 years after transplant.  Among molecular 
abnormalities, FLT3 mutations are the most common.  They are well characterised and 
were the first, and they are still one of the very few “actionable” mutations in AML.  
  Minimal residual disease: Patients in morphological remission may have varying, 
sometimes high, levels of minimal residual disease (MRD).  Several studies in subjects 
undergoing myeloablative and nonmyeloablative conditioning show that the presence of 
MRD has a negative impact on post-transplant relapse risk.  
Page 16 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  Hyperleukocytosis: Up to 20% of AML patients present initially with hyperleukocytosis.  
In a registry-based retrospective study in the EU, hyperleukocytosis was independently 
associated with increased relapse incidence.  
Main Existing Treatment Options 
Treatment for ND AML 
Treatment for AML in general is split into 3 phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance.  
The goal of treatment is to achieve CR or complete response.  CR is achieved if there is no sign 
of leukaemia after treatment, blood counts are back to normal levels, and the patient has 
<5% myeloblasts (blasts) in the bone marrow.  CR is defined on the basis of the methodology 
used for assessment (eg, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular).  There are a few treatment 
categories that may be utilised either alone or in conjunction when treating AML.  
Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, clinical studies, and stem cell transplant are the core treatment 
options for AML.  Treatment schemes are divided into 2 groups: for patients <60 years old and 
for patients ≥60 years old. 
Induction: Induction is the first treatment phase.  The goal is to achieve CR by reducing the 
number of myeloblasts in the bone marrow.  Induction treatment is selected on the basis of 
several factors, including age and cytogenetic risk.  Patients may undergo more than 1 round of 
induction based on response.  If patients achieve CR, then they can move onto consolidation 
treatment.  If the initial induction therapy and reinduction fail, then the AML is considered 
refractory.  Induction treatment schemes for patients <60 years are described in the National 
Comprehension Cancer Network (NCCN) AML Guidelines, Version 3.2020.  
Induction treatment for patients ≥60 years old follows the same principles as those for patients 
<60 years, but additional factors need to be considered.  Factors such as age, performance status, 
functional status, and comorbid conditions are considered when evaluating a patient for intensive 
induction chemotherapy.  Induction treatment schemes for patients ≥60 years are described in 
NCCN AML Guidelines, Version 3.2020.  For patients ≥75 years old with ND AML who are 
candidates for nonintensive therapy, glasdegib with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) is an induction 
option.  The other would be ventetoclax alone or with azacitidine, decitabine, or LDAC.  
Consolidation: Consolidation is the second treatment phase with the goal to prevent the cancer 
from returning by killing any cancer cells left in the body after induction.  Only a patient who 
achieves CR during induction/reinduction therapy will continue to consolidation.  Consolidation 
therapy is selected on the basis of age, cytogenetics, and molecular test results.  Consolidation 
treatment schemes are detailed in NCCN AML Guidelines, Version 3.2020.  
Maintenance: Maintenance therapy is to prevent AML from relapsing.  Not all AML patients 
will receive maintenance therapy as it is highly dependent on the type of disease, consolidation, 
and risk of relapse.  Treatment may include drugs, vaccines, or antibodies that kill cancer cells 
and may be given over months/years.  
The NCCN guideline provides a list of several commonly used regimens for AML that are 
grouped according to age, intensity, or specific mutation.  
Induction treatment strategies for AML patients <60 years: 
  Standard-dose cytarabine with idarubicin or daunorubicin/cladribine 
Page 17 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  HiDAC with idarubicin or daunorubicin 
  Fludarabine with HiDAC, idarubicin, and G-CSF 
Intensive induction treatment strategies for AML patients ≥60 years: 
  Cluster of Differentiation 33 (CD33)-positive AML: Standard-dose cytarabine with 
daunorubicin and gemtuzumab 
  Standard-dose cytarabine with 1 of the following: idarubicin, daunorubicin, or 
mitoxantrone  
  FLT3-mutated (ITD or TKD) AML: Standard-dose cytarabine with daunorubicin and 
midostaurin 
  Venetoclax with 1 of the following: decitabine, azacitidine, or LDAC 
  Low-intensity therapy of azacitidine or decitabine 
Low- and nonintensive induction treatment strategies for AML patients ≥60 years: 
  Venetoclax with 1 of the following: decitabine, azacitidine, or LDAC 
  Glasdegib and LDAC   
  Gemtuzumab for CD33-positive 
  Best supportive care 
  AML with IDH1 mutation: ivosidenib   
  AML with IDH2 mutation: enasidenib 
  AML with FLT3 mutation: Low-intensity therapy (of azacitidine or decitabine) with 
sorafenib or venetoclax-based therapy in combination with (azacitidine, decitabine, or 
LDAC)   
Consolidation postremission treatment strategies for AML patients <60 years: 
  HiDAC with or without gemtuzumab 
  Matched sibling or other donor haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)   
  HiDAC with oral midostaurin for FLT3-mutated AML 
Consolidation postremission treatment strategies and other options for AML patients ≥60 years: 
  Allogeneic HCT 
  Cytarabine options 
  Maintenance therapy with hypomethylating regimens (of azacitidine or decitabine) 
every 4 to 6 weeks until progression 
  Observation 
According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice guideline 
for the treatment of AML, based on eligibility criteria and patient preference, all ND AML 
patients must be assigned to either standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy or 
Page 18 
 
nonintensive treatment.  Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical studies whenever 
possible.  
The recommended treatment regimens for patients with ND AML include the following: 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  Adult patients eligible for standard chemotherapy: 
  1 to 2 cycles of induction with 
o “7 + 3” with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
o “7 + 3” with midostaurin for FLT3-mutated disease 
o Liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine 
o “7 + 3” with cladribine or fludarabine 
  1 to 2 cycles of consolidation and/or HSCT 
o Intermediate-dose cytarabine with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
o Liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine 
o Intermediate-dose cytarabine with midostaurin for FLT3-mutated disease 
  Maintenance with midostaurin for FLT3-mutated disease 
  Adult patients not eligible for standard chemotherapy: 
  4 cycles of induction 
o Hypomethylating agents + venetoclax; LDAC, 6-mercaptopurine, melphalan, 
or hydroxycarbamide 
o Hypomethylating agents or LDAC with or without venetoclax 
  Consolidation: Continue induction and re-evaluate eligibility for transplant 
Treatment for R/R AML 
According to the ESMO guideline, the prognosis of primary R/R AML patients remains poor, 
and treatment is challenging.  A primary consideration in the therapeutic approach of R/R AML 
patients should be their suitability for intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic HCT.  Mutation 
analysis for FLT3 should be repeated in relapsed patients.  
The recommended treatment regimens for patients with R/R AML include the following: 
  Enrolment in a clinical study 
  Primary refractory patients fit for chemotherapy: first or second allogeneic HSCT, or 
donor lymphocyte infusion 
  Patients with relapse, fit for chemotherapy: cytarabine/anthracycline reinduction, 
followed by first or second allogeneic HSCT or by donor lymphocyte infusion 
  All other patients: 
  Hypomethylating agents or LDAC with or without venetoclax 
  Gilteritinib for FLT-mutated AML 
Page 19 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan

  Melphalan   
  Best supportive care 
According to the NCCN AML Guidelines, Version 3.2020, it is strongly preferred for patients 
<60 years and patients ≥60 years old who are physically fit and whose cancers have relapsed to 
be enrolled in clinical studies.  The guidelines also provide a list of several commonly used 
regimens for R/R disease that are grouped as aggressive, less aggressive, or mutation specific.  
The therapy options are listed in the NCCN AML Guidelines, Version 3.2020.  
  Clinical study is strongly preferred 
  AML with FLT3-ITD mutation: Gilteritinib or hypomethylating agents with sorafenib 
 
Ivosidenib/enasidenib for IDH1/2 mutation 
  Gemtuzumab for CD33-positive AML 
  Aggressive chemotherapy for appropriate patients   
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity 
AML is an aggressive cancer that rapidly progresses.  In some cases, AML can spread to other 
organs, including the brain, spinal cord, liver, and spleen.  If untreated, AML is uniformly and 
rapidly fatal because of infectious and/or haemorrhagic complications associated with severe 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; survival is counted in days and weeks.  The prognosis of a 
person diagnosed with AML is dependent on genetic prognostic factors, age, and overall fitness.  
Treatment selection is also determined by those prognostic factors.  With supportive care, it is 
possible for patients to survive for a period of time (median survival: 11 to 20 weeks).,  
However, patients ultimately die of complications associated with bone marrow failure, such as 
infection and haemorrhage.  If treated, survival can be extended, and remission is possible; 
despite treatment, long-term prognosis is generally unfavourable, especially in the elderly and 
R/R populations.  Survival estimates in AML patients are presented below. 
Europe: In EU28, 5-year relative survival among patients with AML was estimated to be 15 to 
17.5% (2000 to 2007 data).  The EU average survival rates were similar among males and 
females at 14.8% and 18.3%, respectively.  Sex-specific 5-year relative survival (in percentages) 
varies by country: 8.5% in Malta to 20.2% in Belgium for males and 7.4% in Estonia to 23.1% in 
Belgium for females.  Survival rates of AML patients differ by age and sex, with females having 
slightly better survival rates, but that difference fades as age increases.  At age 75+ years, 
survival rates are similarly poor between males and females.  Age-specific 5-year relative 
survival (in percentage) among AML patients in Europe is presented in Table Part II: Module 
SI.5.  The mortality rate of AML in Europe was estimated to be between 4 and 6 per 100,000 in 
2013.  Estimates from more recent studies suggest that the mortality rate may be lower.

United Kingdom: There are no UK-wide statistics available for AML survival.  Based on 2000 to 
2007 data, the 5-year relative survival for male AML patients in England, Wales, and Scotland 
are 14%, 12%, and 13%, respectively.  For females, the 5-year relative survival (in percentage) 
in England and Scotland are 16% and 18%, respectively.  Based on 2008 to 2010 data from 
England, the estimated 5-year survival was approximately 20%.  Consistent with findings from 
other countries, survival among younger patients was much higher than that in the elderly 
population; 5-year relative survival for age groups (years) was 65% for patients aged <15 years, 
60% for patients aged 15 to 24 years, 40% for patients aged 35 to 64 years, and 5% for patients 
aged >65 years.  The annual mortality rate of AML in the UK was estimated to 4.3 cases per 
100,000 in 2017.  The rates differ slightly by sex and by region.  
United States: The 5-year relative survival (in percentage) for all patients with AML in the US is 
28.7% (2010 to 2016 data).  Survival rates differ by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, with female 
patients and White patients having slightly better survival rates at a younger age.  However, 
these differences become less pronounced with increasing age, and at age ≥75 years, survival 
rates are similarly poor across the board.  Overall, the 5-year relative survival for AML has been 
increasing, from 6.2% in 1975 to 28.7% in 2016.  
SEER estimates 11,180 deaths among AML patients in 2020 in the US.  The overall age-adjusted 
AML mortality rate was 2.8 per 100,000 per year based on 2014 to 2018 data.  The median age 
at death was 73 years, with most deaths occurring among those ≥65 years old.  Sex- and 
race/ethnicity-specific age-adjusted AML mortality rates in the US are described in Table Part II:

relative survival can be attributed to better survival of younger AML patients because the 
survival among those ≥75 years of age has not increased (Table Part II: Module SI.7).

Adverse Events Anticipated to Occur in the Targeted Population 
Adverse events (AEs) that occur frequently in AML patients are described below.  These include 
AEs associated with the disease or with AML therapies.  These events are expected to occur in 
the proposed patient population independent of the effect of quizartinib and are included here as 
a reference for the assessment of the safety profile of quizartinib. 
Cytopenia: Most patients with AML will present with anaemia of varying severity simply 
because of the nature of the disease.  Patients may also present with thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, or even pancytopenia.  In patients with MDS, which has a high risk of transforming 
into AML, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (platelets <100 × 109/L) is estimated to range 
from 40% to 65%.  For those patients who undergo induction chemotherapy, their anaemia and 
Page 22 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
other cytopenias will worsen, which may lead to further complications.  Chemotherapy used for 
the treatment of AML is highly toxic to developing cells and thus worsens the myelosuppression 
already occurring in AML.  Majority of AML patients suffer from prolonged Grade 4 
neutropenia (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) 
during induction and intensive consolidation chemotherapy.  Failure to achieve neutrophil and 
platelet regrowth following chemotherapy has been reported in up to 26% of subjects with R/R 
AML receiving FLAG-Ida.  
Infection: AML patients have an increased risk of developing infections because of the 
myelosuppression occurring at baseline.  If patients undergo induction chemotherapy or 
consolidation therapy, then that risk increases because of the myelosuppression that accompanies 
most chemotherapeutic agents.  Those who receive stem cell transplantation (SCT) are at high 
risk of developing infections due to the significant depth and duration of neutropenia that occurs 
in SCT recipients.  Risk factors for increased susceptibility to infections in AML patients are 
profound neutropenia, impaired immunity, haemorrhage, and multiple skin-penetrating catheters.  
In a study by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group, 91% of subjects with AML had infection after 
induction chemotherapy, and 43% had a major infection.  Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is also 
very common in AML patients.  Along with other haematologic malignancies, 2% to 49% of 
AML patients suffer from IFI.  In an Italian study of subjects with R/R AML, infections occurred 
in 44% of subjects treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF.  
Neutropenic fevers are exceedingly common among HSCT recipients and AML patients.  The 
incidence of neutropenic fever ranges between 50% and 90%, depending on the phase of the 
disease and the intensity of chemotherapy.  A common cause of neutropenic fevers is mucositis, 
a side effect of several chemotherapeutic agents.  Mucositis can be present along the entire 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and with mucosal barrier injury, bacterial organisms present in the GI 
tract can translocate into the systemic system, leading to neutropenic fever.  
Bleeding: Patients with AML have thrombocytopenia as a result of underlying disease, as well as 
cytotoxic therapy.  Thrombocytopenia can cause haemorrhages in AML patients.  Haemorrhage 
can also occur in AML patients with a normal platelet count due to vascular defects, fibrinolysis, 
and platelet function abnormalities.  Approximately 20% to 32% of thrombocytopenic AML 
patients as well as 34% to 58% of AML patients undergoing alloSCT demonstrate clinically 
significant bleeding.  Platelet transfusion reduces the risk of bleeding in patients with AML 
undergoing induction therapy or SCT; however, in 1 study, 11% of patients with AML 
undergoing induction chemotherapy had a fatal haemorrhage even after they received platelet 
transfusion.  Aside from thrombocytopenia and associated haemorrhages, AML patients can 
have coagulative disorders.  Leukemic cells can cause an inappropriate release of procoagulants 
directly into the bloodstream, initiating the clotting cascade and causing simultaneous clot 
formation and haemorrhage leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).  Rapid DIC 
causes bleeding into the organs, as well as microvascular thromboses, which in turn cause 
dysfunction and failure of multiple organs.  
Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis: AML patients have elevated counts of leukaemic cells.  The 
elevation of leukaemic cells is called hyperleukocytosis.  Leukostasis, or symptomatic 
hyperleukocytosis, is characterised by extreme elevations of leukaemic cells, causing white cell 
plugs in the microvasculature.  This can lead to respiratory failure and intraparenchymal brain 
Page 23 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
haemorrhages.  The frequency of hyperleukocytosis ranges from 5% to 13% in adult AML 
patients.  
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Clinical TLS occurs in AML patients spontaneously or as a result 
of induction chemotherapy.  TLS is characterised by hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalaemia, 
hyperuricemia, hypocalcaemia, and renal insufficiency.  Approximately 5% of AML patients 
develop clinical TLS after induction chemotherapy.  TLS was the major cause of death in 2% of 
AML patients who underwent induction therapy mainly due to renal failure.  In a Spanish study 
of 772 adult subjects with AML receiving induction chemotherapy between 1980 and 2002, 17% 
developed TLS (5% clinical TLS and 12% laboratory TLS).  
Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, also known as 
Sweet’s syndrome, is characterised by fever, multiple tender skin rashes, and neutrophilic 
infiltrate in the skin.  Sweet’s syndrome may occur in association with a malignancy in 
approximately 15% to 20% of cases.  In a study of subjects with AML diagnosed, treated, and 
followed up at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2011, Sweet’s syndrome 
developed in 1% of subjects with AML.  FLT3 mutations were common in AML patients with 
Sweet’s syndrome.  Treatment with FLT3 inhibitors may induce terminal differentiation of 
myeloid blasts to mature neutrophils and may contribute to Sweet’s syndrome-like clinical entity 
in AML patients.  
Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypokalaemia is very common in AML patients, with an estimated 
incidence of 43% to 64%.  The main etiological factor for hypokalaemia is increased serum 
lysozyme level in AML patients, which induces renal tubular injury and eventual kaliuresis.  
Other etiological factors of hypokalaemia in patients with AML include lysozyme independent 
tubular dysfunction, hypomagnesemia, potassium entry into cells, and antibiotic therapy.  AML 
is also reported to be associated with hypomagnesemia (32%), hypophosphatemia (35%), 
hyponatremia (9%), and hypocalcaemia (52%).  In addition, GI side effects of cytarabine 
chemotherapy comprise oral and anal inflammation or ulceration, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhoea, which can contribute to electrolyte abnormalities via GI tract loss. 
Extramedullary involvement: AML may be associated with extramedullary infiltrates (EMI) of 
blast cells, which include myeloid sarcoma, leukaemia cutis, meningeal and gingival infiltrates, 
and hepatosplenomegaly.  EMI have been reported in 2% to 9% of ND AML patients.  This is 
considered to be an underestimate, because at diagnosis, AML patients are not routinely checked 
for EMI.  In childhood AML, EMI at diagnosis is reported in 7% to 49% of patients.  The overall 
frequency of EMI in AML patients is reported to be 20% to 40%.  The most common locations 
for EMI include soft tissue, bones, central nervous system (CNS), and lymph nodes.  Specific 
cutaneous infiltrates or leukaemia cutis are reported in 3% of AML patients.  CNS involvement 
is seen in up to 5% of AML patients.  CNS involvement was found in 1% of AML patients with 
FLT3-ITD mutation at initial diagnosis.  Younger AML patients have a higher proportion of 
CNS involvement.  Myeloid sarcoma can be found in 2% to 8% of AML patients.  
Acute pulmonary failure: Acute pulmonary failure (APF) is a serious complication of induction 
chemotherapy in AML patients.  It may result from pulmonary haemorrhage, capillary leak as a 
result of tumour lysis and/or fluid overload, infections, or sepsis.  In a retrospective study, 8% of 
AML/MDS patients developed APF as a complication of induction therapy.  Elevated creatinine 
or bilirubin, poor performance status, and lung infiltrates at diagnosis were identified as adverse 
Page 24 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
prognostic factors for APF in these patients.  In a study conducted by Al Ameri et al among 
1541 subjects referred for remission induction chemotherapy for AML or high-risk 
myelodysplasia, 8% developed APF requiring ventilatory support within 2 weeks of the initiation 
of chemotherapy.  The mortality rate during induction therapy for these subjects was 73%. 
Pericardial effusion: Pericardial effusion (PEf) occurs in up to 21% of AML patients.  Most of 
these PEfs are small in size and have no apparent effect on patient survival.  Three-fourths of 
these PEfs are therapy related.  
Neutropenic enterocolitis: An estimated 4.3% of AML patients undergoing induction therapy 
develop neutropenic enterocolitis.  
Venous thromboembolism: In the first 3 months of treatment, AML patients have an increased 
risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Approximately 2.5% of patients without 
M3-AML present with VTE at baseline.  Ku et al found that among 5394 cases of AML, the 
2-year cumulative incidence of VTE was 5.2%; 64% of the VTE events occurred within 
3 months of AML diagnosis.  
Complications related to HSCT: AML patients undergoing HSCT must contend with a host of 
complications that follow HSCT.  Pulmonary complications, occurring in 30% to 60% of 
recipients, are the most common life-threatening conditions that develop following HSCT.  In 
addition, patients can develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  In allotransplantation, the 
100-day mortality rate is 10% to 40%, and the main causes of death are GVHD, interstitial 
pneumonitis, and multiple organ failure.  In a retrospective, observational study of subjects with 
leukaemia (acute lymphocytic leukaemia [ALL], AML, or chronic myeloid leukaemia [CML]) 
following allo-HSCT or auto-HSCT between 1980 and 2015, mortality from GVHD was 
reported to be 15.9% of all leukaemia patients and more specifically 19.0% of patients who 
received allo-HSCT.  After allo-HSCT, mortality from GVHD decreased in the very early 
(30-day time period, 0.20 [0.17 to 0.24]), early (100-day time period, 2.49 [2.37 to 2.61]), and 
intermediate phases (1-year time period, 4.28 [4.10 to 4.46]), but increased in the late phase (5-
year time period, 3.85 [3.62 to 4.08]).  In 646 subjects with leukaemia (AML, ALL, MDS, or 
CML) who underwent haplo-HSCT, Grade 2 to Grade 4 acute GVHD at 6 months 
post-transplant was reported by 46% (95% CI, 39% to 54%) of subjects receiving myeloablative 
conditioning/peripheral blood (MAC-PB) transplant, and by 36% (95% CI, 29% to 43%) of 
subjects receiving reduced intensity conditioning/peripheral blood (RIC-PB).  A similar pattern 
was observed for chronic GVHD, where the incidence at 1 year was highest in MAC-PB at 40% 
(95% CI: 32%, 47%), followed by RIC-PB at 34% (95% CI: 27%, 41%).  
Important Comorbidities 
With age, there are marked physiologic declines in most bodily systems: cardiovascular, GI, 
pulmonary, and renal.  Hence, comorbidities occur more frequently among older adults and with 
greater severity.  In a nationwide cohort study of subjects with AML aged ≥15 years (n = 3055) 
during 2000 to 2013 in Denmark, 42% of subjects with AML had at least 1 comorbidity listed in 
the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); 32% had ≥2 comorbidities.  Similarly, in a nationally 
representative (95% coverage) cancer registry in Sweden including adult AML patients 
(n = 2550) during 2002 to 2009, 44% of patients had at least 1 comorbid condition prior to AML 
diagnosis. Additionally, in a large cohort study conducted by using the National Cancer Database 
Page 25 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
(in the US and Puerto Rico) during 2004 to 2014, 50,688 subjects with AML ≥60 years old were 
assessed for comorbidities: 24% had a CCI of 1, and 11% had a CCI ≥2.  The 1-month mortality 
rate for patients in the study was 13%, 19%, and 26% for patients with CCI of 0, 1, and ≥2, 
respectively (P < 0.001).  The likelihood of poor survival and adverse outcomes increased as the 
number of comorbidities increased., In addition, patients with elevated CCI scores are less likely 
to receive chemotherapy, whether single or multiagent.  The important comorbidities listed 
below are expected to occur in the proposed patient population independently of the effect of 
quizartinib and are included here as a reference for the assessment of the safety profile of 
quizartinib. 
Cardiovascular disease: The reported baseline prevalence of cardiovascular disease among adult 
subjects with AML ranges from 8.7% to 14% in large observational studies conducted in the US 
and Sweden.  Major et al characterised the incidence of new cardiovascular comorbidities in 
adults >18 years old with AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after the 
initial therapy.  The incidence of cardiovascular disease 3 years after the initial therapy was 34 of 
453 (7.5%).  In addition, Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the incidence rate of new-onset 
ischaemic heart disease/coronary artery disease was 20.8 vs. 6.2 per 100 person-years (PY) in 
overall AML vs. noncancer controls (P < 0.01).   
Peripheral vascular disease: The reported baseline prevalence of peripheral vascular disease 
among subjects with AML (≥15 to ≥65 years old) ranges from 3% to 19.4% in large 
observational studies conducted in the US, Denmark, and Sweden.  
Congestive heart failure: The reported baseline prevalence of congestive heart failure among 
subjects with AML (≥15 to ≥65 years old) ranges from 2% to 21.5% in large observational 
studies conducted in the US and Denmark.  Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the incidence rate of 
new-onset heart failure was 31.8 vs. 4.7 per 100 PY in overall AML vs. noncancer controls 
(P < 0.01).  
Cerebrovascular disease: The reported baseline prevalence of cerebrovascular disease among 
subjects with AML (≥15 to ≥65 years old) ranges from 7% to 18.2% in large observational 
studies conducted in the US, Denmark, and Sweden.  An unweighted analysis of the 2012 US 
National Inpatient Sample, a representative sample of all US hospitalisations, found a total of 
10,984 admissions with active AML (9384 admissions for AML yet to achieve remission and 
1600 for relapsed AML).  Concomitant stroke, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic, was found 
among 0.59% of the patients with active AML.  There was a 50-fold increase in the risk of stroke 
in active AML patients compared with all admissions.  Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the 
incidence rate of stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or transient ischaemic attack) was 17.0 vs. 5.7 
per 100 PY in overall AML vs. noncancer controls (P < 0.01).   
Myocardial infarction: The reported baseline prevalence of myocardial infarction among subjects 
with AML (≥15 to ≥65 years old) ranges from 4% to 10.5% in large observational studies 
conducted in the US and Denmark.  Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the incidence rate of 
myocardial infarction was 9.4 vs. 2.1 per 100 PY in overall AML vs. noncancer controls 
(P < 0.01).  
Hypertension: The reported baseline prevalence of hypertension among subjects with AML (all 
ages) ranges from 8.7% to 35% in large observational studies conducted in the US and Brazil.  
Major et al characterised the incidence of new-onset hypertension in adults >18 years old with 
Page 26 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after the initial therapy.  The 
incidence of hypertension 3 years after initial therapy was 15%.  
Dyslipidaemia: The reported baseline prevalence of dyslipidaemia among subjects with AML 
(>18 years old) ranges from 8.7% to 35% in large observational studies conducted in the US.  
Major et al characterised the incidence of new-onset dyslipidaemia in adults >18 years old with 
AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after initial therapy.  The incidence of 
dyslipidaemia 3 years after initial therapy was 9%.  
Diabetes: The reported baseline prevalence of diabetes among subjects with AML (all ages) 
ranges from 4.2% to 41.3% in large observational studies conducted in the US, Denmark, 
Sweden, and Brazil.  Major et al characterised the incidence of new-onset diabetes in adults 
>18 years old with AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after initial 
therapy.  The incidence of diabetes 3 years after initial therapy was 6%.  
Obesity: The reported baseline prevalence of obesity among subjects with AML (>18 years old) 
ranges from 11% to 38% in large observational studies conducted in the US.  In a hospital-based 
retrospective study, obesity was found to confer worse prognosis in overweight compared with 
normal-weight AML subjects (HR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9; P = 0.03).  There was also a 
statistically significant difference in the obese group in having coronary artery disease and 
hypertension as comorbid conditions compared with the overweight and normal weight groups 
(coronary artery disease: 13.2% vs. 8.5% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.04; hypertension: 51.2% vs. 31.1% vs. 
17.2%, P < 0.0001).  
Pulmonary disease: The reported baseline prevalence of pulmonary disease among subjects with 
AML (≥15 to ≥65 years old) ranges from 5.8% to 28.2% in large observational studies conducted 
in the US, Denmark, and Sweden.  Major et al characterised the incidence of new-onset 
pulmonary disease in adults >18 years old with AML who achieved and maintained CR for at 
least 3 years after initial therapy.  The incidence of pulmonary disease 3 years after initial 
therapy was 11%.  
Renal disease: The reported baseline prevalence of renal disease among subjects with AML (≥15 
to ≥65 years old) ranges from 0.9% to 10.7% in large observational studies conducted in the US, 
Denmark, and Sweden.  Major et al characterised the incidence of new-onset renal disease in 
adults >18 years old with AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after initial 
therapy.  The incidence of renal disease 3 years after initial therapy was 14%.  In addition, 
Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the incidence rate of renal failure (acute/chronic) was 28.7 vs. 
4.8 per 100 PY in overall AML vs. noncancer controls (P < 0.01).  
Malignancies: The reported baseline prevalence of malignancies among subjects with AML 
(>18 years old) ranges from 14% to 15% in large observational studies conducted in the US and 
Sweden.  Major et al characterised the incidence of new comorbid malignancies in adults >18 
years old with AML who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years after initial therapy.  
The incidence of new malignancies 3 years after initial therapy was 12%.  In addition, 
Dhopeshwarkar et al found that the incidence rate of neoplasms was 61.3 vs. 4.4 per 100 PY in 
overall AML vs. noncancer controls (P < 0.01).  
Comorbidities in R/R AML: In a retrospective cohort study including subjects with AML 
(N = 3911) ≥65 years old using the SEER-Medicare database, a subset of the AML population 
Page 27 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
was identified as R/R AML (N = 1881).  Subjects with R/R AML were younger, had lower 
National Cancer Institute comorbidity scores, lower incidence of events of interest, and a longer 
follow-up time compared with non-R/R AML subjects.  Specific comorbidities and their baseline 
prevalence in the R/R AML population are listed in Table Part II: Module SI.8.

Quizartinib 
PART II: MODULE SII  NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
The nonclinical safety profile of quizartinib (including its active metabolite, AC886) has been 
characterised in the drug safety programme using both in vitro and in vivo pharmacological, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicological studies in mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and 
monkeys.  The toxicity profile of quizartinib has been well characterised in a comprehensive 
battery of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies.  Safety concerns identified in the nonclinical 
studies include corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG), 
myelosuppression, lymphoid depletion, drug-drug interaction (DDI) with strong cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors and strong and moderate CYP3A inducers, GI toxicity, and liver 
function test (LFT) abnormalities.  Other potential safety concerns not refuted by clinical data 
include embryo-foetal and reproductive toxicity. 
Information on key safety findings from nonclinical studies and their relevance to human usage 
is presented in Table Part II: Module SII.1.

Quizartinib 
Nonclinical studies demonstrated the potential for GI effects including 
decreased appetite, emesis, and liquid faeces; similar GI toxicity has 
been observed in humans.  GI toxicity is not considered an important 
risk for quizartinib (Section Part II: Module SVII). 
Toxicity 
Single- and repeat-dose toxicity: 
Rats: Single-dose quizartinib at ≥150 mg/kg and repeated doses at 
≥60/30 mg/kg for 28 days resulted in adverse clinical signs (including 
blood in urine, liquid faeces, decreased physical activity, and pale 
skin) and mortality.  No mortality or treatment-related abnormal 
clinical signs were observed in the 13-week rat study at doses up to 
10 mg/kg.  
Dogs: Single doses of quizartinib up to 200 mg/kg were well 
tolerated; however, multiple doses of 200/250 mg/kg for 7 days or 
150/40 mg/kg for 28 days resulted in either mortality or moribund 
sacrifice.  Clinical signs in moribund dogs included weight loss, 
decreased food consumption, decreased activity, few or no faeces, 
and hunched back or lying on cage floor.  In the 13-week dog study, 
the only observation was skin pallor in both sexes at 15 mg/kg.  
Monkeys: No mortality was observed in the single-dose study at up to 
400 mg/kg or in the 5- or 14-day study at 200 mg/kg.  In the 13-week 
study, reduced appetite, decreased activity, severe dehydration, 
moderate to severe uncoordination, soft and/or liquid faeces, severe 
emesis, hunched posture, prominent backbone, and partly closed eyes 
were observed at ≥10/6 mg/kg.

Key Safety Findings (From Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity:  
Reversible testicular seminiferous tubular degeneration and failure of 
sperm release were evident in rats at 10 mg/kg in the 13-week study.  
Female rats at 10 mg/kg in the 13-week study had toxicologically 
significant ovarian cysts and nonreversible vaginal mucosal 
mucification.  
In the 13-week monkey study, minimal to severe germ cell depletion 
in the testes and atrophy of the uterus, ovary, and vagina were noted 
at ≥10/6 mg/kg.  These changes were reversible following a 4-week 
recovery period.  
In the 13-week dog study, no toxicological significant findings were 
noted at up to 15 mg/kg.  
In the rat embryo-foetal development study, foetotoxicity was evident 
at 6 mg/kg, primarily consisting of lower foetal weights and effects 
on skeletal ossification.  Teratogenicity was also observed at 6 mg/kg 
as evidenced by a high incidence of foetal malformations (anasarca).  
Nephrotoxicity:  
Dose-dependent kidney changes (renal tubular birefringent crystal 
deposition, which was reversible, and tubular basophilia) were most 
prevalent in male rats at ≥10 mg.  No abnormal serum chemistry 
(BUN and creatinine) or urinalysis parameters correlating with renal 
microscopic changes were noted, suggesting that renal function was 
not compromised.  
In dogs, renal tubular basophilia was evident at ≥1 mg/kg without any 
serum chemistry correlates.  In addition, nonbirefringent renal tubular 
pigment was evident in male dogs at 15 mg/kg in the 13-week study.  
In monkeys, slight increases in urea and creatinine were observed, but 
renal tubular basophilia was not observed at up to 30/12 mg/kg.  
Reproductive studies in animals indicate reversible and irreversible 
changes to the reproductive organs of males and females.  These 
changes are relevant to humans.  Reproductive toxicity is included as 
an important potential risk for quizartinib (Section Part II: Module 
SVII). 
Embryo-foetal development studies in animals indicate embryo-foetal 
defects.  These changes are relevant to humans.  
To date, there have been no pregnancies in female patients or partners 
of male subjects receiving quizartinib to evaluate this risk in human 
subjects.  Embryo-foetal toxicity is included as an important potential 
risk for quizartinib (Section Part II: Module SVII). 
Toxicity studies in animals indicate reversible dose-dependent kidney 
changes with no compromise of renal function.  Quizartinib is 
eliminated through the liver with little renal elimination (<2%).  
Subjects with mild or moderately impaired renal function were eligible 
for treatment in the clinical development programme.   
No safety concern of nephrotoxicity has been identified.

Key Safety Findings (From Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Hepatotoxicity:  
Quizartinib mediated liver toxicity is dependent on dose level, 
treatment duration, and species.  In rats, doses of quizartinib for 
28 days resulted in slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and 
ALP) at ≥5 mg/kg.  Liver histological changes (single-cell necrosis) 
were evident in found dead rats at 60/30 mg/kg, but were not 
observed in any per-schedule sacrificed animals.  In the 13-week rat 
study, only slight increases in liver enzymes were evident at 
≥3 mg/kg, and no histological liver changes were evident.  
In monkeys, a moderate increase in ALT, but no elevation of bilirubin 
or histopathological hepatic changes, was noted at up to 
100/60 mg/kg.  However, slight increases in AST, ALT, and TBIL 
and minimal histologic changes (single-cell necrosis, centrilobular 
necrosis, or hepatocellular vacuolation) were observed at 
≥10/6 mg/kg in the 13-week study.  
The dog appeared to be more sensitive to hepatotoxic effects of 
quizartinib (increased AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin) and more 
likely to show histologic changes (birefringent crystal deposition, 
sinusoidal cell activation, and hepatocellular vacuolation).  Liver 
crystal deposition occurred with dose-dependent severity and 
incidence in dogs and was not observed in rats or monkeys.  In the 
13-week dog study the NOAEL for crystal deposition in the liver 
without inflammation and liver enzyme elevation was considered to 
be 5 mg/kg/day.  
Genotoxicity: 
Quizartinib showed potential for mutagenicity in a bacterial reverse 
mutation assay but was negative in a mammalian cell mutation 
(mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase) assay and in a transgenic rodent 
gene mutation assay with Big Blue® rats.  Quizartinib was negative in 
a chromosome aberration assay and in a single-dose rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay, although a rat micronucleus assay conducted in 
conjunction with the 28-day general toxicology study had an 
equivocal result.   
Toxicity studies in animals indicate minor to moderate reversible 
increases in AST, ALT, ALP, or TBIL in rats, monkeys, and dogs.  
Dogs appeared to be more sensitive to these effects, and hepatic crystal 
deposition occurred only in dogs.  
Nonclinical studies have shown that there are inherent differences in 
the hepatic metabolism (parent and metabolites) involving 
hepatocellular transport across species.  In addition, there are 
differences in the xenobiotic transport within the hepatocytes and in 
transport into bile, which leads to dogs being more susceptible to the 
accumulation of quizartinib and metabolites in an intrahepatic 
crystalline form.  
Although not definitively implicated in crystal pathogenesis, a unique 
quizartinib metabolite (morpholino oxidation product) has been 
observed only in the dog and not in the human, rat, or monkey species.  
As a result, crystal deposition in dog liver is not considered relevant to 
humans.  
Elevations of AST, ALT, ALP, or TBIL have also been observed in 
human studies; however, these have been mild and transient in general.  
LFT abnormalities are not considered an important risk for quizartinib 
(Section Part II: Module SVII). 
Based on the available data the genotoxic potential of quizartinib is 
considered to be low. 
Quizartinib is proposed for the treatment of an acute malignant 
condition, and the potential for genotoxicity is not considered a safety 
risk for quizartinib.

Quizartinib 
Carcinogenicity:  
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted.  
Haematological/haematopoietic toxicity:  
In all species, the principal target organs affected were the bone 
marrow and lymphoid organs.  Nonclinical studies demonstrated the 
potential for bone marrow suppression resulting in haematopoietic 
toxicity.  Decreased WBC and/or red blood cell indices correlating 
with bone marrow hypocellularity were observed in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys.  The NOAELs for severe haematopoietic inhibition and 
resultant bone marrow hypocellularity in 13-week studies were 
3 mg/kg/day in rats, 5 mg/kg/day in dogs, and 3 mg/kg/day in 
monkeys.  
Quizartinib is indicated for the treatment of an acute malignant 
condition.  De novo carcinogenicity is not considered a safety risk for 
the proposed patient population consisting of adults with ND AML.  
Infiltration of the bone marrow by leukaemic blasts is a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with AML owing to neutropenia, 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia.  Chemotherapy used 
for the treatment of AML is highly toxic to developing cells and thus 
worsens myelosuppression already occurring in AML.  Almost all 
patients with AML suffer from prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia during 
induction and intensive consolidation chemotherapy, and the incidence 
of neutropenic fever ranges between 50% and 90%, depending on the 
phase of the disease and the intensity of chemotherapy. 
Haematological abnormalities, including anaemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia, have been observed in human studies with 
quizartinib.  Myelosuppression can be associated with the development 
of infections and haemorrhage in treated subjects.  The incidence of 
these disorders in the quizartinib studies is not markedly higher than 
that seen in the general AML population owing to AML itself and/or to 
chemotherapeutic regimens.  Management of haematological 
abnormalities constitutes part of the routine clinical care of subjects 
with AML. 
Myelosuppression is an identified risk for quizartinib; however, it is 
not considered to have an impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
quizartinib in the treatment of patients with ND AML and is not 
included as an important safety risk (Section Part II: Module SVII).

Lymphoid organ toxicity:  
In all species, the principal target organs affected were the bone 
marrow and lymphoid organs.  Nonclinical studies demonstrated the 
potential for reversible lymphoid organ toxicity.  Decreased thymic 
organ weights and thymic lymphoid necrosis/atrophy were observed 
in rats, dogs, and monkeys in a dose- and treatment 
duration-dependent manner.  Thymic atrophy/necrosis was evident in 
rats at ≥1 mg/kg, in dogs at ≥1 mg/kg, and in monkeys at 
≥10/6 mg/kg.  Splenic atrophy was observed in rats at ≥60/30 mg/kg, 
in dogs at 50/25 mg/kg, and in monkeys at ≥3 mg/kg.  Lymphoid 
organ changes were reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys following a 
4-week recovery period. 
Infiltration of the bone marrow by leukaemic blasts is a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with AML owing to neutropenia, 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia.  Chemotherapy used 
for the treatment of AML is highly toxic to developing cells and thus 
worsens myelosuppression already occurring in AML.  
Lymphopenia has been observed in clinical studies to date.  Lymphoid 
depletion is likely to be associated with the development of infections, 
including opportunistic infections in the treated subjects.  Patients with 
AML are at a high risk of developing infections, regardless of any 
additional risk conferred from AML therapy.  Risk factors contributing 
to the increased susceptibility of patients with AML to infections are 
profound neutropenia, impaired immunity, haemorrhage, and multiple 
skin-penetrating catheters.  Infections have been observed in human 
studies with quizartinib.  The incidence of infections in the quizartinib 
studies is not markedly higher than that seen in the general AML 
population owing to AML itself and/or to chemotherapeutic regimens.  
Management of infections constitutes part of the routine clinical care 
of subjects with AML. 
Myelosuppression is an identified risk for quizartinib; however, it is 
not considered to have an impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
quizartinib in the treatment of patients with ND AML, and is not 
included as an important safety risk (Section Part II: Module SVII).

Quizartinib 
Dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation has been observed in 
human studies with quizartinib.  QTc interval prolongation is 
considered a potential risk factor for the development of ventricular 
arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes.  QTc interval prolongation 
and torsade de pointes are considered an important identified risk for 
quizartinib (see Section Part II: Module SVII).  
Cardiotoxicity:  
Studies in animals demonstrated a potential for QTc prolongation in a 
dose-dependent manner.  No other significant effects on the 
cardiovascular system were identified in those studies. 
Quizartinib and its metabolite AC886 at 3 μM showed statistically 
significant inhibition of hERG channel currents by 16.4% and 12.0%, 
respectively.  Quizartinib inhibited slowly activating delayed IKs more 
strongly with the maximum inhibition of 67.5% at 2.9 μM.  The 
maximum inhibition of IKs by AC886 was 26.9% at 2.9 μM.  Neither 
quizartinib nor AC886 showed toxicologically significant inhibition 
on ICa-L, INa, and INa-L, at up to 3 M, the highest concentration tested.  
Therefore, it is suggested that quizartinib and AC886 induced 
blockade of hERG and IKs currents and, therefore, caused 
prolongation of the QTc interval on ECG by a decrease in the net 
repolarisation currents.  The effect on IKs was more dominant than 
that on hERG. 
No treatment-related changes in ECGs were observed in dogs at 
150/40 mg/kg in the 28-day study and at 15 mg/kg in the 13-week 
study and in monkeys at 100/60 mg/kg in the 28-day study and at 
10/6 mg/kg in the 13-week study.  Furthermore, no toxicologically 
significant morphological changes in the heart occurred in rats, dogs, 
or monkeys following single and repeated oral administration of up to 
13 weeks.

General Safety Pharmacology 
CNS and respiratory system: 
Rat CNS and respiratory system safety pharmacology studies were 
not conducted because there was no indication of CNS or pulmonary 
effects in the rat, dog, or monkey in general toxicology studies of up 
to 13-week duration.  
Contact sensitisation/phototoxicity:  
Quizartinib was not considered to be a contact sensitiser in guinea 
pigs.  In addition, quizartinib was not phototoxic in the in vitro 
neutral red uptake phototoxicity test with Balb/c 3T3 mouse 
fibroblasts. 
Drug-drug interactions: 
Role of CYP enzymes in quizartinib metabolism: 
CYP3A4/5 is the primary isoform responsible for the metabolism of 
quizartinib in vitro.  AC886 is both formed and further metabolised 
by CYP3A4/5.  
P-gp-mediated transport of quizartinib: 
Quizartinib is a P-gp substrate.  
In vitro studies (MDCK cell lines) showed reduced transport of 
digoxin in the presence of quizartinib.  In vitro studies using 
MDCKII-MDR1 cells showed that IC50 of quizartinib and AC886 for 
P-gp transport was 9.55 and >30 μM, respectively. 
Quizartinib has weak potential to inhibit P-gp, primarily on 
P-gp-mediated GI transport (Igut/IC50 >10). 
No safety concern identified. 
No safety concern identified. 
In vitro findings in CYP3A4/5 metabolic studies and P-gp-mediated 
transport are relevant to humans. 
In vitro metabolism and clinical drug interaction studies indicate that 
there is a potential for other medications to alter the PK of quizartinib.  
For quizartinib, both the parent and the active metabolite (AC886) are 
metabolised by CYP3A4/5.  Therefore, strong CYP3A inhibitors, such 
as azole antifungals, increase quizartinib plasma exposure.  Increased 
exposure of quizartinib may result in an increase in the adverse effects 
of quizartinib.  DDIs with strong CYP3A inhibitors are included as an 
important identified risk for quizartinib (see Section Part II: Module 
SVII). 
Clinical PK data showed that quizartinib Cmax and AUCinf 
decreased by approximately 45% and 90%, respectively, 
when coadministered with efavirenz, a moderate CYP3A 
inducer.  Induction of CYP3A metabolism is expected to 
result in decreased efficacy of quizartinib.  DDIs with strong 
or moderate CYP3A inducers are included as an important 
identified risk for quizartinib (see Section Part II: Module 
SVII).

Quizartinib 
Relevance to Human Usage 
In vitro studies assessing the effect of the efflux transporter, 
P-gp, suggest that quizartinib is both a substrate and an 
inhibitor of P-gp. 
Although quizartinib is a P-gp substrate based on in vitro data, clinical 
data suggest that P-gp plays a minimal role in the absorption or 
clearance of quizartinib.  Additionally, as dose adjustment is required 
for concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors, many of which also inhibit 
P-gp, no specific dose adjustment is required for P-gp inhibitors.  DDI 
with P-gp inhibitors or P-gp inducers is not considered a safety risk for 
quizartinib. 
In vitro studies showed that quizartinib is a potential intestinal P-gp 
inhibitor.  Clinical PK data showed that coadministration of quizartinib 
and dabigatran etexilate (a P-gp substrate) increased total and free 
dabigatran Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, and increased total and 
free dabigatran AUCinf by 13% and 11%, respectively.  P-gp transport 
inhibition due to quizartinib is not considered a safety risk. 
Quizartinib demonstrates a concentration-dependent QTc 
interval-prolonging effect, which increases the risk of interactions with 
drugs known to prolong the QT interval.  DDI interaction with QT 
interval-prolonging drugs is not considered an additional important 
risk for quizartinib (Section Part II: Module SVII).

PART II: MODULE SIII  CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
The quizartinib clinical programme consists of 26 studies conducted by the Sponsor, including 
13 studies in either ND or R/R AML, 1 study in solid tumours, and 12 single-dose studies in 
healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment.  Of the 13 studies in AML, 10 are 
completed.  Across the completed studies, quizartinib has been administered to 1081 subjects 
with AML (hereafter referred to as All AML Pool) up to the data cut-off date (ie, 13 Aug 2021). 
Throughout the development of quizartinib, the expression of strength of quizartinib doses was 
conveyed in protocols, manuscripts, and clinical study reports as the dihydrochloride salt and not 
the active moiety (freebase).  The milligram dose for the dihydrochloride salt is slightly larger 
than that of the freebase for equivalent strengths, as shown in Table Part II: Module SIII.1.  The 
doses cited throughout this submission are for the dihydrochloride salt; however, the doses used 
in the packaging and labelling are for the freebase in order to comply with the US Food and Drug 
Administration and EU policy.

As of the data cut-off date (ie, 13 Aug 2021), quizartinib monotherapy has been administered to 
1081 subjects with AML (Table Part II: Module SIII.2). 
The 1081 subjects in the All AML Pool received at least 1 dose of quizartinib in 
Studies AC220-A-U302 (n = 265), 2689-CL-0005 (n = 18), AC220-A-J102 (n = 7), AC220-007 
(n = 241), AC220-002 (n = 333), 2689-CL-2004 (n = 74), CP0001 (n = 76), AC220-A-J101 
(n = 16), AC220-A-J201 (n = 38), and 2689-CL-0011 (n = 13) (Module 2.7.4 Section 1.1.1).  
Among these 1081 subjects, 535 (49.5%) were male, 546 (50.5%) were female, 577 (53.4%) 
were <60 years old, 140 (13.0%) were 60 to <65 years old, 304 (28.1%) were 65 to <75 years 
old, and 60 (5.6%) were ≥75 years old.  Most subjects were White (72.2%). 
The majority of exposure data in subjects with ND AML come from the pivotal study 
AC220-A-U302.  Therefore, the tables below present pooled AML exposure data rather than 
exposure data by indication. 
Exposure to quizartinib was generally similar in males and females, although more females than 
males were exposed for ≥731 days (Table Part II: Module SIII.3). 
Exposure to quizartinib slightly varied by age group (Table Part II: Module SIII.4), and the 
lowest exposures were observed in subjects aged ≥75 years. 
Exposure to quizartinib is shown by race and sex in Table Part II: Module SIII.5 and in special 
populations by sex in Table Part II: Module SIII.6.  
The majority of subjects (669/1081) received quizartinib at doses of 30 to 60 mg (Table Part II: 
Module SIII.7).  Exposure by dose group and sex is shown in Table Part II: Module SIII.8.

PART II: MODULE SIV  POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
SIV.1  Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the 
Development Programme 
The quizartinib clinical development programme includes 1 pivotal clinical study 
(Study AC220-A-U302) in subjects with ND AML.  Enrolment of subjects in the study was 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to allow for the evaluation of safety and efficacy for 
the specific indication while minimising risk for subjects. 
The following populations were excluded from the pivotal study: 
  Age <18 years 
Reason for exclusion: The safety and efficacy of quizartinib in children and adolescents 
younger than 18 years have not been established. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: The safety and efficacy of quizartinib in children and adolescents younger than 
18 years are being investigated in a specific paediatric development programme.  The 
subject population consisting of children younger than 18 years is not relevant for the 
pursued indication of treatment of adults with ND AML, which is FLT3-ITD positive. 
Page 42 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  Absence of FLT3-ITD-activating mutation in bone marrow (allelic ratio of ≤ 3% 
FLT3-ITD/total FLT3)  
Reason for exclusion: Quizartinib is a highly potent intracellular inhibitor of FLT3-ITD 
catalytic activity but has little activity against other kinases.  Because of the highly 
specific activity of quizartinib, it is intended for the treatment of AML where FLT3-ITD 
is the main driver mutation (allelic ratio of ≥3% FLT3 ITD/total FLT3).  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Quizartinib is not intended for the treatment of subjects with AML where 
FLT3-ITD is not the main driver mutation. 
  Women who were pregnant or women of childbearing potential at risk of becoming 
pregnant  
Reason for exclusion: Potential risks to unborn baby due to quizartinib. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Embryo-foetal and reproductive toxicity is included as an important potential 
risk in the RMP. 
  Women who are lactating 
Reason for exclusion: No data on quizartinib secretion in breast milk. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Use of quizartinib in women who are breastfeeding is not recommended 
(see Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] Section 4.6).  Alternatives to breast 
milk are readily available and the likelihood of breastfed infants to be exposed to 
quizartinib is considered to be very small. 
  Pre-existing severe renal impairment 
Reason for exclusion: Potential effect of impaired renal function on quizartinib 
elimination and exposure. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Because quizartinib has minimal renal excretion (<2%), it is not expected that 
pre-existing renal impairment will increase exposure to quizartinib or its metabolites.  
Subjects with mild or moderately impaired renal function were eligible for treatment in 
the clinical development programme.  Safety in subjects with severe renal impairment is 
unknown; however, subjects with severe renal impairment who also have AML are 
considered to have poor prognosis and to be unfit for intensive chemotherapy, and no 
significant use of quizartinib in this patient population is anticipated.  
  Pre-existing severe hepatic impairment 
Reason for exclusion: Potential effect of impaired hepatic function on quizartinib 
elimination and exposure. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Page 43 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Rationale: Quizartinib is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary 
excretion.  In 2 dedicated hepatic impairment studies (one based on Child-Pugh criteria in 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and the other based on National 
Cancer Institute Organ-Dysfunction Working Group criteria in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment), no clinically meaningful changes in quizartinib and its active 
metabolite AC886 were observed.  Quizartinib after a single administration of a 30-mg 
dose was found to be well tolerated in subjects with mild or moderate pre-existing hepatic 
impairment and no safety concern was identified.  No dose adjustment is required for 
subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Safety in subjects with severe hepatic impairment is unknown; however, subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment who also have AML are considered to have extremely poor 
prognosis and to be unfit for intensive chemotherapy, and no significant use of 
quizartinib in this patient population is anticipated.  
  Subjects with pre-existing QT interval prolongation, diagnosis or suspicion of long 
QT syndrome 
Reason for exclusion: Quizartinib has been associated with QTc interval prolongation on 
ECG. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: QTc interval prolongation is included as an important identified risk for 
quizartinib.  The risk of QT prolongation and associated arrhythmias in subjects with a 
pre-existing QT interval prolongation will be monitored and evaluated as part of the 
evaluation of the risk of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to QTc interval 
prolongation in the general quizartinib patient population.  Congenital long QT syndrome 
is a contraindication for the use of quizartinib. 
  Subjects with serum electrolytes outside the institution’s normal limits: potassium, 
calcium, and magnesium  
Reason for exclusion: Serum electrolyte abnormalities are an independent risk factor for 
QT interval prolongation on ECG and for the development of cardiac arrythmias. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: QTc interval prolongation is included as an important identified risk for 
quizartinib.  Correction of electrolyte abnormalities before and during treatment with 
quizartinib is required by the proposed product label.  The risk of QTc prolongation and 
associated arrhythmias in subjects with any serum electrolyte abnormalities will be 
monitored and evaluated as part of the assessment of the risk of QTc interval 
prolongation/torsade the pointes in the general quizartinib patient population. 
Page 44 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  Patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease (including 
arrhythmias and cardiac conduction abnormalities, ischaemic heart disease, and 
congestive heart failure) 
Reason for exclusion: Subjects with significant cardiovascular disease are at an increased 
risk of developing QTc interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation is an important identified 
risk for quizartinib.  The risk of QTc prolongation and associated arrhythmias in subjects 
with a history of cardiovascular disease will be monitored and evaluated as part of the 
evaluation of the risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation in the general 
quizartinib patient population.  
  Severe medical conditions (including unresolved toxicity from previous treatment, 
another malignancy, infection, and medical conditions considered by the 
investigator to put the subjects at risk from participation in the study) 
Reason for exclusion: To ensure that subjects with relatively preserved functional 
capacity are included in the study population, to mitigate potential confounders in the 
assessment of the safety profile, and to exclude conditions that may preclude adherence 
to study protocol schedules. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: The safety profile of quizartinib in the population of adults with AML, which 
is FLT3-ITD positive, is well described in the clinical development programme, which 
has included older subjects (aged up to 75 years), and those with concurrent severe 
medical conditions, including infections and bleeding.  Chemotherapy regimens, which 
form the standard of care for the treatment of ND AML, are associated with significant 
and severe toxicities.  Quizartinib has demonstrated an acceptable benefit-risk profile in 
this patient population, with manageable toxicities.  The safety profile of quizartinib in 
patients with pre-existing severe medical conditions, who are judged by the treating 
physicians to be able to tolerate treatment with quizartinib, is expected to be the same as 
that of the general quizartinib patient population.  
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (AML subtype M3) 
Reason for exclusion: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL [AML subtype M3]) was 
excluded because effective treatment for this subtype of AML exists.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Quizartinib is not indicated for this subtype of AML.  The treatment of APL 
differs from usual AML treatment.  Initial treatment of APL includes the 
non-chemotherapy drug all-trans-retinoic acid, which is most often combined with an 
anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin), sometimes also with cytarabine.  Use of 
quizartinib in subjects with APL is not anticipated. 
Page 45 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
  AML secondary to prior chemotherapy for other neoplasms, except secondary to 
prior MDS 
Reason for exclusion: AML secondary to prior chemotherapy for other neoplasms is a 
distinct clinical entity, with poor prognosis.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: The safety and efficacy profile of quizartinib in subjects with FLT3-ITD 
positive AML has been thoroughly evaluated during the clinical programme.  No 
additional safety concerns are anticipated in subjects with FLT3-ITD positive AML 
secondary to prior chemotherapy for other neoplasms and who are judged by the treating 
physician to be able to benefit from treatment with quizartinib. 
  History of or current CNS involvement with AML 
Reason for exclusion: CNS involvement from AML is a serious complication requiring 
treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy or cranial radiation.  Quizartinib is not expected 
to be effective for the treatment of CNS involvement from AML. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: Use of quizartinib is not anticipated in subjects with CNS involvement from 
AML not managed by standard-of-care therapy. 
  Prior treatment with quizartinib 
Reason for exclusion: To adequately assess the efficacy and safety profile of quizartinib 
in treatment-naïve subjects. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale:  The safety of quizartinib has been assessed in the clinical development 
programme, and no additional safety concerns are expected in subjects with prior 
exposure to quizartinib. 
  Prior treatment with a FLT3 targeted therapy  
Reason for exclusion: To adequately assess the efficacy and safety profile of quizartinib 
in subjects naïve to previous FLT3 targeted therapy  
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: The safety and efficacy profile of quizartinib in subjects with FLT3-ITD 
positive AML has been thoroughly evaluated during the clinical programme.  No 
additional safety concerns are anticipated in subjects with FLT3-ITD positive AML who 
have previously been treated with FLT3-targeted therapy and who are judged by the 
treating physicians to be able to benefit from treatment with quizartinib. 
  Prior treatment for AML (except for leukapheresis, hydroxyurea, cranial 
radiotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and growth factor/cytokine support)  
Reason for exclusion: To adequately assess the efficacy and safety profile of quizartinib 
in subjects naïve to previous AML therapy.  
Page 46 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?  No 
Rationale: The safety and efficacy profile of quizartinib in subjects with FLT3-ITD 
positive AML has been thoroughly evaluated during the clinical programme.  No 
additional safety concerns are anticipated in subjects with FLT3-ITD positive AML who 
have previously been treated for AML therapy and who are judged by the treating 
physicians to be able to benefit from treatment with quizartinib. 
SIV.2  Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial 
Development Programs 
The clinical development programme for quizartinib is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse 
reactions such as rare adverse reactions and those occurring as part of the underlying disease 
being treated.  The quizartinib clinical development programme included 133 (12%) subjects 
treated for >12 months, which is considered sufficient to detect adverse reactions from prolonged 
and cumulative quizartinib exposure. 
SIV.3  Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented 
in Clinical Trial Development Programs 
The number of subjects from under-represented populations that were exposed to quizartinib in 
the clinical development programme is presented in Table Part II: Module SIV.1.

PART II: MODULE SV  POSTAUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE 
Postauthorisation Exposure 
SV.1 
Marketing authorisation of VANFLYTA was first granted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare of Japan for the treatment of adult subjects with FLT3-ITD positive R/R AML on 
18 Jun 2019.  The approved dose regimen is 26.5 to 53 mg once daily (QD).  Currently, 
quizartinib is not approved for marketing in any other country other than Japan. 
Cumulatively, from 18 Jun 2019 to 28 Oct 2021, 228 patients are estimated to have received 
quizartinib in the postmarketing setting, all of whom were in Japan.   
Marketing exposure data from subjects with R/R AML have been obtained at similar doses to the 
dose regimen for the proposed indication; therefore, data obtained in this setting are relevant for 
the overall assessment of the safety of quizartinib. 
SV.1.1  Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
Following marketing authorisation, quizartinib was subject to all-case safety surveillance.  Data 
collected have been used to calculate exposure.

PART II: MODULE SVI  ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
There is no evidence of potential for misuse of quizartinib for illegal purposes.  Quizartinib is 
prescription-only medication, prescribed in an oncology setting, which minimises possible 
misuse.  In addition, given its mode of action and no evidence of CNS activity or withdrawal 
symptoms associated with quizartinib treatment, the potential for misuse is considered 
negligible.  The pharmaceutical characteristics and PK/pharmacodynamic characteristics of 
quizartinib are not characteristic of drugs with high dependence potential 
(eg, rapid-onset/short-acting active substances).

Quizartinib 
PART II: MODULE SVII  IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
The pivotal Phase 3 study, Study AC220-A-U302, is the main source of safety information for 
the target indication of ND FLT3-ITD (+) AML.  As the majority of subjects with ND AML in 
the quizartinib clinical development programme were from the pivotal study, no integrated 
analyses for the ND population were performed.  Instead, data from Study AC220-A-U302 were 
pooled with those of 8 other completed clinical studies in AML, including both subjects with ND 
AML and subjects with R/R AML treated with quizartinib monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy, to provide an integrated safety profile of quizartinib (All AML Pool; see 
Section Part II: Module SIII). 
Integrated safety analyses of the All AML Pool were used to provide supportive data with 
quizartinib at all dose ranges and, in particular, to assess the safety profile of quizartinib at the 
target dose (30 to 60 mg).  The sections below focus on safety data from the overall study period 
in Study AC220-A-U302 and the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool (N = 669; hereafter 
referred to as 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool).  This dose group includes 
quizartinib-treated subjects from the pivotal Study AC220-A-U302 and from 
Studies AC220-007, 2689-CL-0011, AC220-A-J201, 2689-CL-2004, and 2689-CL-0005, and 
subjects who were assigned to a dose of 30 to 60 mg QD from the remaining studies (CP0001, 
AC220-A-J101, AC220-A-J102).  
SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
The reasons for not including identified or potential risks in the list of safety concerns are 
presented in the following sections.  
SVII.1.1.1.  Risks with Minimal Clinical Impact on Patients (in Relation to the Severity 
of the Indication Treated) 
SVII.1.1.1.1.  Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Appetite Disorders 
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and decreased appetite are recognised 
ADRs for quizartinib.  Although frequent, these ADRs were generally nonserious, rarely led to 
discontinuation of quizartinib therapy, and are considered to have minimal clinical impact on 
patients with ND AML. 
The incidence of these ADRs (including associated preferred terms [PTs]) is presented in  
Table Part II: Module SVII.1 for Study AC220-A-U302 and in Table Part II: Module SVII.2 for 
the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool (N = 699).

SVII.1.1.1.3.  Nervous System Disorders 
Headache is recognised as an ADR for quizartinib.  The events of headache were generally 
nonserious, did not lead to discontinuation of quizartinib therapy, and are considered to have 
minimal clinical impact on patients with AML.  The incidence of headache ADRs (including 
associated PTs) is presented in Table Part II: Module SVII.5 for Study AC220-A-U302 and in 
Table Part II: Module SVII.6 for the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool (N = 699).

SVII.1.1.1.4.  Liver Function Test Abnormalities 
Adverse Events 
LFT abnormalities occur frequently in subjects with AML due to various factors, including AML 
therapy, concomitant medications, and AML disease process.  The LFT abnormalities that 
occurred in the quizartinib programme were generally mild, transient, and manageable by dose 
interruption and/or reduction.  None of the cases of LFT abnormalities were considered 
indicative of drug-induced liver injury due to quizartinib, and they are not considered to have a 
significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product.  
Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is recognised as an ADR for quizartinib.  In Study 
AC220-A-U302, events of ALT increased were reported in 42 (15.8%) subjects in the quizartinib 
group and 27 (10.1%) subjects in the placebo group, and were of Grade ≥3 in 2 (0.8%) and 
2 (0.7%) subjects, respectively (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Tables 4.1.3 and 4.1.5).  Serious events 
were reported only in 2 (0.7%) subjects in the placebo group, while events leading to study drug 
discontinuation were reported only in 1 (0.1%) subject in the quizartinib group (Module 5.3.5.3 
SCS Tables 4.1.11 and 4.1.13). 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, events of ALT increased were reported in 
92 (13.8%) subjects and were of Grade ≥3 in 28 (4.2%) subjects (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS 
Tables 4.1.3 and 4.1.5).  Few of the subjects had events that were serious (2 [0.3%] subjects) or 
that led to study drug discontinuation (2 [0.3%] subjects) (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Tables 4.1.11 and 
4.1.13).  
Laboratory Data 
In Study AC220-A-U302, ALT levels ≥3 × upper limit of normal were reported in 
75 (28.3%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 56 (20.9%) subjects in the placebo group 
(Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.2).  In the 30 to 60 mg group of All AML Pool, a total of 
140 (20.9%) subjects had ALT levels ≥3 × upper limit of normal.

SVII.1.1.2.  Known Risks that Do Not Impact the Risk-Benefit Balance 
SVII.1.1.2.1.  Risks Associated with Myelosuppression 
Cytopenias (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) and associated 
disorders of infection (upper respiratory tract infections, herpes infections, fungal infections, and 
bacteraemia), and bleeding (epistaxis) are recognised ADRs for quizartinib. 
Cytopenias, infection, and bleeding occur frequently in subjects with AML, irrespective of 
quizartinib treatment (Section Part II: Module SI).  Management of cytopenias, infection, and 
bleeding is part of the routine clinical care of subjects with ND AML.  The incidences of these 
disorders in the quizartinib studies is not markedly higher than that seen in the general AML 
population owing to AML itself and/or to chemotherapeutic regimens, and they are not 
considered to have a significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product.  The risk of 
cytopenias and the associated risks of infection and bleeding are well described in the proposed 
label, and no additional pharmacovigilance activities or risk minimisation measures are 
proposed.  The events of cytopenias, infections, and epistaxis in Study AC220-A-U302 and in 
the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool are described below.  The occurrence of events of 
cytopenias (including associated PTs) is presented in Table Part II: Module SVII.7 for 
Study AC220-A-U302 and in Table Part II: Module SVII.8 for the 30 to 60 mg group of the All 
AML Pool.  The occurrence of events of infections (including associated PTs) is presented in 
Table Part II: Module SVII.9 for Study AC220-A-U302 and in Table Part II: Module SVII.10 for 
the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool. 
SVII.1.1.2.1.1.  Cytopenias 
Adverse Events 
Study AC220-A-U302 
Overall, in Study AC220-A-U302, the most frequent cytopenia events were neutropenia 
(54 [20.4%] and 27 [10.1%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively), 
thrombocytopenia (30 [11.3%] and 30 [11.2%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, 
respectively), and anaemia (29 [10.9%] and 19 [7.1%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo 
groups, respectively) (Table Part II: Module SVII.7). 
Events of neutropenia were reported in 54 (20.4%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 
27 (10.1%) subjects in the placebo group, and were mostly of  Grade ≥3.  Four (1.5%) subjects in 
the quizartinib group and 5 (1.9%) subjects in the placebo group had serious events of 
neutropenia, and 2 (0.8%) subjects in the quizartinib group had events associated with study drug 
discontinuation.  Events of neutrophil count decreased were reported in 27 (10.2%) subjects in 
the quizartinib group and 12 (4.5%) subjects in the placebo group, were mostly of Grade ≥3, and 
were serious in 4 (1.5%) subjects in the quizartinib group.  There were no events of neutrophil 
count decreased associated with study drug discontinuation.  None of the subjects had an event 
of neutropenia or neutrophil count decreased with a fatal outcome. 
Events of thrombocytopenia were reported in 30 (11.3%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 
30 (11. 2%) subjects in the placebo group, and were mostly of Grade ≥3.  Two (0.8%) subjects in 
the quizartinib group and 8 (3.0%) in the placebo group had serious events of thrombocytopenia, 
and 3 (1.1%) subjects in the quizartinib group had events associated with study drug

Quizartinib 
discontinuation.  Events of platelet count decreased were reported in 18 (6.8%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 8 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group, and were mostly of Grade ≥3.  One 
(0.4%) subject in each treatment group has a serious event of platelet count decreased, and none 
had events associated with study drug discontinuation.  None of the subjects had an event of 
thrombocytopenia or platelet count decreased associated with a fatal outcome. 
Events of anaemia were reported in 29 (10.9%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 
19 (7.1%) subjects in the placebo group, and were of Grade ≥3 in 15 (5.7%) and 
14 (5.2%) subjects, respectively.  Two (0.8%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 
2 (0.7%) subjects in the placebo group had serious events of anaemia, and 1 (0.7%) subject in the 
quizartinib group had an event associated with study drug discontinuation.  None of the events of 
anaemia were associated with a fatal outcome.  
Events of pancytopenia were reported in 7 (2.6%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 
1 (0.4%) subject in the placebo group, and were mostly of Grade ≥3.  Pancytopenia was serious 
in 1 (0.4%) subject in the placebo group, and was associated with study drug discontinuation in 
1 (0.4%) subject in the quizartinib group.  None of the subjects had an event of pancytopenia 
associated with a fatal outcome. 
30 to 60 mg Group of the All AML Pool 
Overall, in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, the most frequent cytopenia events were 
anaemia (165 [24.7%] subjects), neutropenia (128 [19.1%] subjects), and thrombocytopenia 
(125 [18.7%] subjects) (Table Part II: Module SVII.8). 
A total of 165 (24.7%) subjects had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of anaemia.  
Most were Grade ≥3; 11 (1.6%) subjects had serious events, and 1 (0.1%) subject had an event 
associated with study drug discontinuation.  None of the events of anaemia were associated with 
a fatal outcome.  
A total of 128 (19.1%) subjects had TEAEs of neutropenia and 70 (10.5%) had TEAEs of 
neutrophil count decreased, most of whom had Grade ≥3 events.  Serious events of neutropenia 
and neutrophil count decreased were reported in 10 (1.5%) subjects and 6 (0.9%) subjects, 
respectively.  A total of 4 (0.6%) subjects had neutropenia that was associated with study drug 
discontinuation, while none of the neutrophil count decreased events were associated with study 
drug discontinuation.  None of the subjects had an event of neutropenia or neutrophil count 
decreased with a fatal outcome. 
A total of 125 (18.7%) subjects had TEAEs of thrombocytopenia and 74 (11.1%) subjects had 
TEAEs of platelet count decreased, most of whom had Grade ≥3 events .  Serious events of 
thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased were reported in 7 (1.0%) subject and 3 (0.4%) 
subjects, respectively.  A total of 4 (0.6%) subjects had thrombocytopenia that was associated 
with the study drug discontinuation and 1 (0.1%) subject had an event of thrombocytopenia with 
fatal outcome.  None of the events of platelet count decreased was associated with study drug 
discontinuation or with a fatal outcome. 
Pancytopenia was reported in 17 (2.5%) of subjects, most of whom had Grade ≥3 events.  Four 
(0.6%) subjects had events of pancytopenia that were serious, and 2 (0.3%) subjects had events 
that were associated with study drug discontinuation.  None of the events of pancytopenia was 
associated with a fatal outcome.

Laboratory Data 
In addition to the reported TEAE of cytopenias, laboratory data for the respective haematological 
parameters are included below for Study AC220-A-U302 and for the 30 to 60 mg group of the 
All AML Pool. 
Study AC220-A-U302 
Shifts to Grade 3 anaemia were mostly observed in subjects with Grade 2 values at Baseline 
(87 [33.7%] and 106 [39.7%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively) 
followed by subjects with Grade 1 values at Baseline (6 [2.3%] and 8 [3.0%] subjects in the 
quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively), and subjects with normal values at Baseline (only 
1 [0.4%] subject in the quizartinib group) (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  There were no 
subjects with shifts to Grade 4 anaemia on treatment. 
More than 70% of subjects in both treatment groups had Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased at 
Baseline that persisted during treatment (181 [74.8%] and 196 [76.3%] subjects in the quizartinib 
and placebo groups, respectively; Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  Shifts to Grade 3 neutrophil 
count decreased were observed in 1 (0.4%) subject with normal value at Baseline and in 1 (0.4%) 
subject with Grade 2 at Baseline in the quizartinib group, and in no subjects in the placebo 
group.  Shifts to Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased were observed in: subjects with normal 
values at Baseline (21 [8.7%] and 10 [3.9%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, 
respectively), subjects with Grade 1 values (3 [1.2%] and 5 [1.9%] subjects, respectively), 
Page 60 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
subjects with Grade 2 values (4 [1.7%] and 8 [3.1%] subjects, respectively), and subjects with 
Grade 3 values (20 [8.3%] and 26 [10.1%] subjects, respectively).  
Approximately half of subjects had Grade 4 platelet count decreased at Baseline that persisted 
during treatment (138 [53.5%] and 128 [47.9%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, 
respectively; Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  Shifts to Grade 3 platelet count decreased were 
observed in only 1 (0.4%) subject in the placebo group with Grade 1 values at Baseline, and in 
subjects with Grade 2 values (3 [1.2%] and 3 [1.1%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo 
groups, respectively).  Shifts to Grade 4 platelet count decreased were observed in subjects with 
normal values at Baseline (1 [0.4%] and 5 [1.9%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, 
respectively), subjects with Grade 1 values (9 [3.5%] and 9 [3.4%] subjects, respectively), 
subjects with Grade 2 values (21 [8.1%] and 14 [5.2%] subjects, respectively), and subjects with 
Grade 3 values (72 [27.9%] and 86 [32.2%] subjects, respectively). 
30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool 
Shifts to Grade 3 anaemia were mostly observed in subjects with Grade 2 values at Baseline (235 
[35.8%]), followed by subjects with Grade 1 and normal values at Baseline (53 [8.1%] and 14 
[2.1%], respectively) (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  There were no subjects with shifts to 
Grade 4 anaemia on treatment.  
Approximately half of the subjects had Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased at Baseline that 
persisted during treatment (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  Shifts to Grade 3 neutrophil count 
decreased were observed in 12 (1.9%) subjects with normal values at Baseline, in 
5 (0.8%) subjects with Grade 1 values, and in 6 (1.0%) subjects with Grade 2 values.  Shifts to 
Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased were observed in 100 (16.2%) subjects with normal values at 
Baseline, 25 (4.1%) subjects with Grade 1 values, 27 (4.4%) subjects with Grade 2 values, and 
75 (12.2%) subjects with Grade 3 values.  
Approximately 40% of subjects had Grade 4 platelet count decreased at Baseline that persisted 
during treatment (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 5.1.1).  Shifts to Grade 3 platelet count decreased 
were observed in 4 (0.6%) subjects with normal values at Baseline, in 9 (1.4%) subjects with 
Grade 1 values, and in 10 (1.5%) subjects with Grade 2 values.  Shifts to Grade 4 neutrophil 
count decreased were observed in 18 (2.7%) subjects with normal values at Baseline, 45 (6.9%) 
subjects with Grade 1 values, 56 (8.5%) subjects with Grade 2 values, and 184 (28.0%) subjects 
with Grade 3 values. 
SVII.1.1.2.1.2. 
Infections 
Study AC220-A-U302 
Overall, in Study AC220-A-U302, infections ADRs were reported in <10% of subjects 
(Table Part II: Module SVII.9).  The most frequently reported events were upper respiratory tract 
infection (21 [7.9%] subjects in the quizartinib group and 15 [5.6%] subjects in the placebo 
group), oral herpes (18 [6.8%] subjects in the quizartinib group and 12 [4.5%] subjects in the 
placebo group), and bacteraemia (16 [6.0%] subjects in the quizartinib group and 6 [2.2%] 
subjects in the placebo group).  Grade ≥3 events were reported in ≤3.8% of subjects.  Generally, 
events were nonserious and not associated with study drug discontinuation.  Mucormycosis was 
the only event associated with a fatal outcome in 2 (0.3%) subjects in the quizartinib group.

respiratory tract infection (in 52 [7.8%] subjects) and oral herpes (in 34 [5.1%] subjects).  
Grade ≥3 events were reported in ≤3.1% of subjects.  Generally, events were nonserious and not 
associated with study drug discontinuation.  Events associated with a fatal outcome were: 
mucormycosis (in 2 [0.3%] subjects), sinusitis and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (each in 
1 [0.1]% subject).

SVII.1.1.2.1.3.  Bleeding 
In Study AC220-A-U302, events of epistaxis were reported in 40 (15.1%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 29 (10.8%) in the placebo group were of Grade ≥3 in 3 (1.1%) and 
1 (0.4%) subjects, respectively, and serious in only 1 (0.4%) subject in the quizartinib group 
(Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Tables 4.1.3, 4.1.5, and 4.1.11).  There were no events of epistaxis 
associated with study drug discontinuation or with a fatal outcome (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS 
Tables 4.1.9 and 4.1.13).  
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, events of epistaxis were reported in 86 (12.9%) 
subjects, were of Grade ≥3 in 10 (1.5%) subjects, and serious in 1 (0.1%) subject 
(Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Tables 4.1.3, 4.1.5, and 4.1.11).  There were no events of epistaxis 
associated with study drug discontinuation or with a fatal outcome (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS 
Tables 4.1.9 and 4.1.13).  
SVII.1.1.2.2.  Drug-Drug Interactions with QT Interval-Prolonging Drug 
Dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation has been observed in human studies with quizartinib.  
Coadministration of quizartinib and other medications that prolong the QT interval on ECG may 
potentially increase the risk of subjects developing QTc interval prolongation. 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 599 (89.5%) subjects used at least 1 concomitant 
QT-prolonging medications with “known risk” according to the Arizona Center for Education 
and Research on Therapeutics at some point in the study.  This suggests that subjects were able 
to tolerate concomitant therapy with drugs that are known to result in QT prolongation when 
considered essential for the care of the subjects.  
Subgroup analysis by use of QT-prolonging medication showed that concomitant administration 
of QT-prolonging medications had no significant impact on the incidence of QT interval 
corrected by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) interval prolongation.  In addition, concomitant 
administration of QT-prolonging drugs was not found to be a statistically significant covariate on 
baseline QTcF or maximum value of QTc changes (Emax) in a concentration-QTc model (Module 
2.7.2 Section 3.4.2.1). 
Serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation are an important identified risk for 
quizartinib, which is appropriately communicated in the SmPC.  The potential for DDI with 
other QT-interval prolonging drugs is described in Section 4.5 of the SmPC, Interaction with 
other medicinal products and other forms of interaction. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC, Warnings and precautions for use includes recommendation that 
patients should be monitored more frequently with ECG if coadministration of VANFLYTA 
with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval is required.  No additional risk 
minimisation measures are proposed for this risk, and it will be evaluated and monitored as a part 
of the evaluation of the main risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation.  Risk 
minimisation measures for the main risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation 
are discussed in Section Part V.

SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
RMP 
The list of all quizartinib ADRs is included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  The risks considered 
important identified and important potential risks for risk management planning are included in 
the sections below.  
Important identified risks include serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation  and 
increased incidence of ADRs due to DDI with strong CYP3A inhibitors.  Important potential 
risks include embryo-foetal and reproductive toxicity. 
Important Identified Risk 1: Serious ADRs Related to QTc Interval Prolongation  
Frequency:  
In Study AC220-A-U302, TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged were reported in 36 (13.6%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 11 (4.1%) subjects in the placebo group.  Events were of Grade ≥3 in 8 (3.0%) 
and 3 (1.1%) subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively, and were serious in 
1 (0.4%) subject in each treatment group.  Treatment was interrupted for 7 (2.6%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 3 (1.1%) subjects in the placebo group, and discontinued for 2 (0.8%) subjects in 
the quizartinib group only. 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged were reported in 
133 (19.9%) subjects.  Most subjects had events that were Grade 1 or Grade 2, 21 (3.1%) subjects had 
events of Grade ≥3, and 8 (1.2%) subjects had events reported as serious.  The dose of quizartinib was 
interrupted for 21 (3.1%) subjects and discontinued for 4 (0.6%) subjects.   
In Study AC220-A-U302, treatment-emergent QTcF readings of >450 ms (Grade 1) were reported in 
91 (34.3%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 48 (17.9%) subjects in the placebo group, readings of 
>480 ms (Grade 2) were reported in 20 (7.5%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 6 (2.2%) subjects 
in the placebo group, and readings of >500 ms (Grade 3) were reported in 6 (2.3%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 2 (0.7%) in the placebo group. 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 284 (42.5%) subjects had a treatment-emergent QTcF 
reading of >450 ms, 75 (11.2%) subjects had a value >480 ms, and 17 (2.5%) subjects had a value 
>500 ms. 
In order to assess the frequency of torsade de pointes and arrhythmias potentially associated with QT 
prolongation, the Sponsor conducted an analysis of the pooled safety data from the AML groups, using 
the Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQ) torsade de 
pointes/QT prolongation (narrow and broad) plus the additional PTs of fall, presyncope, agonal 
rhythm, arrhythmia, cardiac flutter, paroxysmal arrhythmia, and death. 
In Study AC220-A-U302, 49 (18.5%) subjects in the quizartinib group and 30 (11.2%) subjects in the 
placebo group had at least 1 event in the torsade de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ; events were of 
Grade ≥3 in 18 (6.8%) in the quizartinib group and 8 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group.  The most 
frequently reported events (all grades) were ECG QT prolonged (36 [13.6%] and 11 [4.1%] subjects in 
the quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively), fall (5 [1.9%] and 7 [2.6%] subjects, respectively), 
syncope (7 [2.6%] and 5 [1.9%] subjects, respectively), and presyncope (4 [1.5%] and 7 [2.6%] 
subjects, respectively).  
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 173 (25.9%) subjects had at least 1 event in the torsade 
de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ, and 44 (6.6%) subjects had events of Grade ≥3.  The most 
frequently reported events (all grades) were ECG QT prolonged (133 [19.9%] subjects), fall 
(25 [3.7%] subjects), syncope (20 [3.0%] subjects), and presyncope (10 [1.5%] subjects).  At the 
recommended dosing regimen for the treatment of ND AML, ventricular arrhythmia events considered 
potentially associated with quizartinib included 2 cases of cardiac arrest with recorded ventricular

Quizartinib 
fibrillation (one with fatal outcome) in subjects with severe hypokalaemia, and 1 case of death (subject 
died in sleep with no cause identified).  In total, 1 event of torsade de pointes occurred in the 
quizartinib development programme, at a dose higher than the currently proposed, and which occurred 
in a subject with additional risks factors (hypocalcaemia, sepsis with episodes of respiratory arrest, and 
underlying atrial fibrillation) for ventricular arrhythmia.  
Seriousness: 
ECG QTc interval prolongation is an electrophysiological finding, generally without adverse clinical 
effect to the subject.  QTc interval prolongation is a risk factor for the development of life-threatening 
or fatal cardiac arrhythmias (eg, torsade de pointes).  The risk of QTc interval prolongation leading to 
clinically significant sequelae (ie, torsade de pointes) significantly increases when QTc interval is 
>500 ms.  Torsade de pointes can be life-threatening or result in fatal cardiac arrest.  When reported as 
an AE in the clinical studies with quizartinib, TEAEs of QTc interval prolongation have been mostly 
nonserious and of CTCAE Grade 1 and 2 severity.  Most of the events in the torsade de pointes/QT 
prolongation SMQ were nonserious and resolved.  In Study AC220-A-U302, 4 (1.5%) subjects in the 
quizartinib group and 2 (0.7%) subjects in the placebo group had serious events.  Of the 4 serious 
events, cardiac arrest was reported in 2 (0.8%) subjects in the quizartinib group only.  All other serious 
events were reported at most in 1 subject per treatment group: ECG QT prolonged (1 [0.4] subject in 
each treatment group), death and ventricular fibrillation (each in 1 [0.4%] subject in the quizartinib 
group).  In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, a total of 20 (3.0%) subjects had serious 
events.  The most frequently reported serious events were ECG QT prolonged (8 [1.2%] subjects) and 
syncope (6 [0.9%] subjects).  Three (0.4%) subjects, of whom 2 in Study AC220-A-U302 (see above), 
had serious events of cardiac arrest (1 of the subjects also had a separate event of ventricular 
fibrillation reported), 1 (0.1%) subject had serious events of ventricular tachycardia, 1 (0.1%) subject 
had a serious event of fall, and 1 (0.1%) subject had a serious event of death.  Two (0.3%) subjects had 
fatal events of cardiac arrest.  Further details of these cases are available in Section SVII.3.1. 
Risk-benefit impact: 
QTc interval prolongation is an ECG finding that is generally asymptomatic.  However, QTc interval 
prolongation as a marker of impaired cardiac repolarisation and marked QTc prolongation is 
considered a potential risk factor for the development of severe or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  
Severe or life-threatening arrhythmias could be associated with significant morbidity (hospitalisation, 
medical procedures, etc) and mortality.  Torsade de pointes, although rare, is associated with a 
significant risk of sudden cardiac death.  Monitoring of ECG and quizartinib dose modification is 
recommended to minimise the risk of the subject developing cardiac arrhythmias or torsade de pointes.  
The effects of QTc interval prolongation on individual quality of life were not assessed.

Quizartinib 
Important Identified Risk 2: Increased Incidence of ADRs due to DDI with Strong 
CYP3A Inhibitors  
Frequency:  
Strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as azole antifungals, increase quizartinib plasma exposure by 
approximately 2-fold (see Section SVII.3.1).  In the Phase 3 programme studies, quizartinib dose 
reduction for concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor use was required. 
Data on the frequency of DDI between strong CYP3A inhibitors and quizartinib do not exist.  The 
Sponsor has reviewed TEAE data from the AML Pool for concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors.  In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 329 (49.2%) subjects took at least 1 strong 
CYP3A inhibitor concomitantly with quizartinib.  A subgroup analysis of TEAEs did not reveal any 
notable differences in the types and overall frequency of TEAEs reported in subjects who 
concomitantly used a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and those who did not.  Concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A inhibitor was shown to be associated with a higher incidence of QTcF prolongation on ECG.  
The frequency of QTcF elevations >500 ms was observed in 11 (3.3%) subjects who concomitantly 
used strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 6 (1.8%) subjects who did not.  In addition, changes from Baseline 
in QTcF of >30 ms and >60 ms were reported in a higher proportion of subjects who concomitantly 
used strong CYP3A4 inhibitor compared with subjects who did not (203 [61.7%] vs. 185 [54.4%] and 
43 [13.1%]) and 30 [8.8%] subjects, respectively). 
Seriousness:  
DDIs with strong CYP3A inhibitors result in increased exposure to quizartinib and the likelihood of 
the subject experiencing AEs due to quizartinib.  These can range from mild nonserious reactions to 
severe life-threatening or fatal events.  
Risk-benefit impact:  
Increased exposure due to inhibition of quizartinib metabolism by strong CYP3A inhibitors can result 
in increased incidence of quizartinib toxicities, including QTc interval prolongation on ECG and 
torsade de pointes.  Quizartinib dose should be reduced when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors.

Potential risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns include 
embryo-foetal and reproductive toxicity. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-Foetal and Reproductive Toxicity 
Frequency:  
Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity data for quizartinib are described in Table Part II: 
Module SII.1.  
Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for the studies in the quizartinib clinical development 
programme.  In addition, women of childbearing potential as well as male subjects were required to use 
reliable forms of contraception to prevent the occurrence of pregnancy or drug exposure to foetus.  No 
pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a male patient treated with quizartinib occurred in the 
clinical development programme.  
No clinical data on the effect of quizartinib on fertility is available. 
Seriousness:  
No pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a male patient treated with quizartinib occurred 
in the clinical development programme; however, any potential embryo-foetal or reproductive 
toxicity is expected to be serious.  
Risk-benefit impact:  
Embryo-foetal toxicity due to quizartinib can result in foetal death or severe congenital abnormalities.  
Based on findings in animals, female and male fertility may be impaired with quizartinib treatment.

SVII.3.1.  Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
In the sections below, safety data from the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool are presented 
as they provide an appropriate summary of the integrated safety profile at the target dosing 
regimen.  Results from the other dose groups of the All AML Pool are discussed where relevant.  
Results from Study AC220-A-U302 are also presented where relevant. 
SVII.3.1.1 Important Identified Risk: Serious ADRs Related to QTc Interval Prolongation  
Risk groups or risk factors:  
Quizartinib is known to be associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QTc interval, 
which is a risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de 
pointes. 
Recognised risk factors for QTc prolongation include hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia or 
hypocalcaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicinal 
products or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high-dose 
anthracycline therapy.  Other risk factors include baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long 
QT syndrome, cardiac history (eg, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, myocardial infarction), 
the elderly, and the female population.   
Individual patient risk factors for the development of torsade de pointes include congenital or 
acquired long QT syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, and 
hypocalcaemia), concomitant medications (eg, Class IA, Class IC, and Class III antiarrhythmic 
agents, phenothiazines, antiretroviral drugs, and tricyclic antidepressants), endocrine disorders, 
and cardiac disorders. 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as azole antifungals, increase quizartinib plasma exposure.  QTc 
interval prolongation with quizartinib has been shown to be dose and concentration dependent, 
and increased exposure to quizartinib can result in higher incidence of QTc interval prolongation.  
Characterisation of the risk:  
Quizartinib is known to be associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QTc interval that 
is substantially reduced and generally well managed at lower doses.  The assessment of QTc 
prolongation in the clinical development programme evaluated TEAEs in the QT 
Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes SMQ plus additional selected PTs (fall, presyncope, agonal 
rhythm, arrhythmia, cardiac flutter, paroxysmal arrhythmia, and death) as well as QTcF interval 
data on ECG to provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the effect of quizartinib 
monotherapy on cardiac conduction.

Subgroup analysis of QT prolongation indicated that elevations >450 ms were more frequent in 
in females and subjects who used concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (Table Part II: Module 
SVII.12).  In contrast, age appeared not to be a factor impacting the incidence of QT interval 
prolongation based on reported TEAE or ECG data, with no clear trend for increased incidence 
with increased age.  Similarly, concomitant administration of QT-prolonging medications had no 
significant impact on the incidence of QTcF interval prolongation.  The incidence of QTcF 
prolongation (>450 ms and change from Baseline >60 ms) appeared to increase with longer 
treatment duration, although this is likely a feature of event accrual during the longer follow-up 
time in subjects with longer treatment duration.

A model analysis of quizartinib concentration and QTc interval (C-QTc) on ECG was performed 
based on data from the pivotal Study AC220-A-U302. 
In Study AC220-A-U302, a direct-response Emax model best described the C-QTcF relationship 
between quizartinib concentrations and QTcF.  The median model-predicted QTcF at Cmax at 
steady state in subjects with ND AML in Study AC220-A-U302 during the Continuation Phase 
at 30 and 60 mg, assuming no dose interruption or discontinuation, were 18.4 ms (90% 
CI = 16.3, 20.5) and 24.1 ms (90% CI = 21.4, 26.6), respectively.  The covariates that were 
Page 75 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
tested in the C-QTcF model included hypokalaemia, serum calcium and magnesium 
concentrations, age, body weight, sex, race, and use of QT-prolonging drugs, beta-blocker drugs 
and anthracycline.  Age and hypokalaemia had an effect on the baseline QTcF.  The covariate 
analysis on the drug effect model identified age, concurrent daunorubicin use, hypokalaemia, and 
calcium levels as statistically significant covariates on Emax.  However, interindividual variability 
on Emax was increased after including the covariate effects, and these effects were not seen in the 
graphical analysis.  In addition, age, daunorubicin use, and hypokalaemia effects were estimated 
with high uncertainty with relative standard error >34%.  As a result, these covariate effects were 
not retained in the model.  The remaining covariates had no effect on the baseline QTcF 
(Module 5.3.3.5 Exposure-response Report AC220-PMx010). 
To further evaluate concomitant use of QT-prolonging medications with quizartinib, an 
additional evaluation was conducted using data from subjects who had matched concentrations 
and ECG measurements during the time of concomitant administration of QT-prolonging 
medications and during the time when those same subjects were not taking QT-prolonging 
medication.  A within-subject analysis of the C-QTcF relationship in the presence and absence of 
QT-prolonging medications showed that concomitant administration of QT-prolonging 
medications had no impact on the observed QTcF increases associated with quizartinib 
concentrations (Module 2.7.2 Section 3.4.2.1). 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, cardiac events potentially associated with QT 
prolongation were reported in 173 (25.9%) subjects (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 4.1.27).  Most 
subjects had events that were Grade 1 or Grade 2, 44 (6.6%) subjects had events of Grade ≥3, 
and 20 (3.0%) subjects had an event that was reported as serious.  The dose of quizartinib was 
interrupted for 21 (3.1%) subjects and discontinued for 7 (10%) subjects due to cardiac events 
potentially associated with QTc interval prolongation.   
The most common TEAEs in this category were events of ECG QT prolonged.  A 
dose-dependent trend in events of ECG QT prolonged was observed with the highest incidence 
in the >60 mg group of the All AML Pool (Table Part II: Module SVII.13).  The other common 
TEAEs identified by this MedDRA search included fall, syncope, and presyncope (Table Part II: 
Module SVII.13).  On individual case review, these events had alternative aetiologies present, 
such as infections, vasovagal reaction, anaemia, and orthostatic hypotension; none of these 
events were associated with any evidence of ventricular arrhythmia as a cause of the event. 
The incidence of ventricular arrhythmia was low at the recommended dose level.  In 
Study AC220-A-U302, 2 subjects experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
(TESAEs) of cardiac arrest (1 with fatal outcome) that were associated with recorded ventricular 
fibrillation on ECG (reported as a separate TEAE for 1 of the subjects) and occurred in the 
context of Grade 3 or 4 hypokalaemia.  An additional subject died in his sleep 10 days after the 
last dose of quizartinib with no cause of death identified and no significant QTcF prolongation 
during the study (Module 5.3.5.1 AC220-A-U302 CSR Section 10.4.1). 
In addition to the above cases a comprehensive review of all potential cardiac arrhythmia events 
from the entire quizartinib development program revealed a single case of non-sustained torsade 
de pointes and 1 additional case of cardiac arrest, both of which occurred at higher quizartinib 
doses in subjects with some evidence of QTcF prolongation prior to the event.  The event of 
non-sustained torsade de pointes occurred in a subject receiving quizartinib 90 mg with QTcF

Quizartinib 
prolongation (543 ms) at the time of the event.  The event of fatal cardiac arrest occurred in a 
subject in the setting of sepsis 4 days after the starting quizartinib dose of 90 mg was increased to 
135 mg, and the subject was on a concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitor.  The subject’s QTcF 
interval had increased from baseline of 408 ms to a maximum of 496 ms 4 days before the 
cardiac arrest but was reportedly 471 ms the day before death (Module 2.7.4 Section 2.1.5.4.1).

Quizartinib 
Potential mechanisms: 
Blockade of IKs currents by quizartinib and its metabolite AC886 decreases the net repolarisation 
currents and prolongs cardiac repolarisation.  
Preventability:  
The risk of torsade de pointes with quizartinib is associated with its effect of prolonging cardiac 
repolarisation, manifested by prolongation of QTc interval on ECG.  The risk of QTc interval 
prolongation leading to clinically significant sequelae (ie, torsade de pointes) significantly 
increases when QTc interval is >500 ms.  Correspondingly, the measures to prevent QTc interval 
prolongation also apply to the risk of torsade de pointes.   
The following recommendations are included in the SmPC: 
  VANFLYTA should be initiated only if QTcF interval is <450 ms 
  VANFLYTA is contraindicated in subjects with congenital long QT syndrome 
  VANFLYTA should be used with caution in patients who are at a significant risk of 
developing QTc interval prolongation. 
  The dose of VANFLYTA should be reduced when used concomitantly with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors as they may increase quizartinib exposure. 
  Monitoring and correction of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesemia should be 
performed prior to and during treatment with VANFLYTA.  More frequent 
monitoring of electrolytes and ECGs should be performed in patients who experience 
diarrhoea or vomiting.  
  Patients should be monitored more frequently with ECG during coadministration of 
VANFLYTA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval. 
  Quizartinib dose should be reduced for subjects with QTcF >480 ms.  For subjects 
with QTcF >501 ms, quizartinib should be interrupted and restarted at a reduced dose 
when QTcF interval returns to <450 ms. 
  Following dose initiation and escalation, ECGs should be performed at least once 
weekly for 2 weeks then as clinically indicated.  ECG monitoring of the QT interval 
should be performed more frequently in patients who are at significant risk of 
developing QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. 
  VANFLYTA should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop recurrent 
QTcF ≥501 ms or torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs or 
symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia. 
For further details see SmPC Section 4.4.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
QTc interval prolongation is an ECG finding that is generally asymptomatic.  Data from the 
quizartinib clinical development programme indicate that significant QTc interval prolongation 
(eg, Grade ≥3) occurs infrequently at the proposed dose of 35.4 to 53 mg QD.  The risk of QTc 
interval prolongation leading to clinically significant sequelae (ie, torsade de pointes) 
Page 79 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
significantly increases when QTc interval is >500 ms.  QTc interval prolongation in patients 
receiving quizartinib can be effectively managed by dose reduction or interruption, serum 
electrolyte abnormalities management, and avoidance if possible, of the use of concomitant 
QT interval-prolonging drugs.   
QTc interval prolongation as a marker of impaired cardiac repolarisation and marked QTc 
prolongation is a potential risk factor for the development of severe or life-threatening cardiac 
arrhythmias that could be associated with significant morbidity (hospitalisation, medical 
procedures, etc.) and mortality.  Torsade de pointes is associated with a significant risk of sudden 
cardiac death.  Torsade de pointes and other ventricular arrhythmias have been infrequently 
reported in the quizartinib clinical development programme.  Monitoring of ECG and quizartinib 
dose modification is recommended to minimise the risk of the subject developing cardiac 
arrhythmias or torsade de pointes.  The occurrence of torsade de pointes in a subject treated with 
quizartinib would require discontinuation of quizartinib therapy.  
Potential public health impact: 
Rough estimates of the size of the target population of patients with ND AML, which is 
FLT3-ITD positive, are available.  The estimated size of the population expected to be treated 
with quizartinib is approximately 520 subjects per year in the 5 largest EU Member States 
(Germany, France, UK, Spain, and Italy), approximately 620 subjects per year in the US, and 
approximately 300 subjects per year in Japan.  
Quizartinib is associated with the development of dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation, 
which is a risk factor for torsade de pointes.  Significant QTc interval prolongation (ie, QTcF 
>500 ms) occurred in 2.5% of subjects receiving quizartinib at doses 30 to 60 mg of daily.  There 
were no cases of torsade de pointes at the recommended quizartinib doses, and cardiac 
arrest/ventricular fibrillation occurred in <1% of subjects in the All AML Pool.  
The requirement for ECG monitoring for QTc interval prolongation to prevent the development 
of torsade de pointes will represent an additional burden on the health system.  The occurrence of 
acute cardiac arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes may have a short-term public health impact 
in terms of increased demand for emergency cardiac resuscitation.  This public health impact is 
expected to be offset by improved patient outcomes and reduced complications from ND AML. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Dose-dependent QTc prolongation was observed in the clinical development programme.  
Approximately 20% of subjects had TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged; however, most of these cases 
were mild and were manageable with dose modification or electrolyte correction, and very few 
events were serious or led to study drug discontinuation.  QTc interval prolongation is a risk 
factor for the development of severe or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including torsade de 
pointes, which is associated with a significant risk of sudden cardiac death.  Torsade de pointes 
or other ventricular arrhythmias have been infrequently reported with the recommended 
quizartinib dosing regimen with QTc-based dose modification.

SVII.3.1.2 Important Identified Risk: Increased Incidence of ADRs due to DDI with Strong 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
CYP3A Inhibitors  
Risk groups or risk factors:  
No specific risk factors are identified. 
Characterisation of the risk:  
For quizartinib, both the parent and the active metabolite (AC886) are metabolised by CYP3A.  
Therefore, strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as azole antifungals, increase quizartinib plasma 
exposure.  Increased exposure of quizartinib may result in an increase in the adverse effects of 
quizartinib. 
In a DDI study in healthy volunteers, concomitant use of quizartinib with ketoconazole, a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor, increased the exposure of quizartinib and its active metabolite AC886 
compared to the use of quizartinib alone.  Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily 
for 28 days) with single-dose administration of quizartinib resulted in increased Cmax by 17% and 
AUCinf by 94%.  At steady state, exposure (Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve from time 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24h]) was estimated to be increased by 86% and 96%, 
respectively.  In the DDI study with fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, the predicted 
Cmax and AUC at steady state were approximately 20% higher. 
The Sponsor has reviewed TEAE data from the All AML Pool for concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors.  In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 329 (49.2%) subjects 
concomitantly used at least 1 strong concomitant CYP3A during the study (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS 
Table 3.1.3).  Within this subgroup, some differences in the incidence of events in the following 
categories were observed when comparing subjects who concomitantly used a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor (n = 329) and those who did not (n = 340; Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 4.1.2): 
  The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs, TESAEs (overall and study drug-related), and 
TEAEs associated with study drug interruption were reported more frequently (>5 pp 
higher incidence) in subjects who used strong CYP3A4 inhibitors than those who did 
not.  
Despite these differences, the types and frequencies of TEAEs and those identified by the SMQ 
searches were generally consistent between subjects who used strong CYP3A inhibitors and 
those who did not (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 4.1.15). 
In a categorical summary of QT/QTcF elevations by concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, a QTcF of >500 ms was observed in 
11 (3.3%) subjects who concomitantly used strong CYP3A inhibitors and 6 (1.8%) subjects who 
did not.  A higher percentage of subjects had change from Baseline in QTcF of >30 ms 
(203 [61.7%] subjects and 185 [54.4%] subjects, respectively) and QTcF of >60 ms (43 [13.1%]) 
and 30 [8.8%] subjects, respectively).  No other trends in ECG findings among subgroups could 
be identified (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 7.1.2). 
Page 81 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Potential mechanisms:  
The mechanism for this risk is reduced metabolism of quizartinib due to CYP3A inhibition.  
Preventability:  
Adverse effects resulting from DDI can be prevented by appropriate restriction on the use of 
concomitant interacting drugs, as well as quizartinib dose reduction if concomitant use of a 
strong CYP3A inhibitor is required (see Section 4.5 of the SmPC, “Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of interaction”). 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Increased exposure due to inhibition of quizartinib metabolism by strong CYP3A inhibitors can 
result in an increased incidence of quizartinib toxicities, including QTc interval prolongation on 
ECG and torsade de pointes.  In the event that use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is required, 
appropriate dose reductions of quizartinib should be undertaken to decrease the risk of subjects 
experiencing quizartinib-associated toxicities.  
Potential public health impact :  
Rough estimates of the size of the target population of patients with ND AML, which is 
FLT3-ITD positive, are available.  The estimated size of the population expected to be treated 
with quizartinib is approximately 520 subjects per year in the 5 largest EU Member States 
(Germany, France, UK, Spain, and Italy), approximately 620 subjects per year in the US, and 
approximately 300 subjects per year in Japan.  
No estimates of the absolute risk of increased incidence of ADRs due to DDI with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors are available.  
Serum level monitoring of quizartinib is not required during concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors.  Public health impact is anticipated mainly from quizartinib toxicity due to higher 
quizartinib exposure, which can be severe or life-threatening and requires hospitalisation and 
potentially significant diagnostic and treatment efforts, thereby adding burden to the healthcare 
system.  This public health impact is expected to be offset by improved patient outcomes and 
reduced complications from ND AML. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:   
Concomitant use of quizartinib with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased the exposure of 
quizartinib and its active metabolite AC886 compared to the use of quizartinib alone in healthy 
volunteers.  Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 28 days) with single-dose 
administration of quizartinib resulted in increased Cmax by 17% and AUCinf by 94%.  At steady 
state, exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) was estimated to be increased by 86% and 96%, 
respectively.  Increased quizartinib exposure may increase the risk of toxicity.

Quizartinib 
SVII.3.1.3 Important Potential Risk: Embryo-Foetal and Reproductive Toxicity 
Risk groups or risk factors:  
No specific risk factors have been identified. 
Characterisation of the risk:  
Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity data for quizartinib are described in 
Table Part II: Module SII.1.  
Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for the studies in the quizartinib clinical development 
programme.  In addition, women of childbearing potential as well as male subjects were required 
to use reliable forms of contraception to prevent the occurrence of pregnancy or drug exposure to 
foetus.  No pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a male patient treated with quizartinib 
occurred in the clinical development programme. 
Potential mechanisms:  
The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown. 
Preventability: 
Data on the preventability of the risk to fertility are not available.  The risk of embryo-foetal 
toxicity can be prevented by measures to prevent occurrence of pregnancy during quizartinib 
therapy or drug exposure to quizartinib during pregnancy, and the risk of infant exposure during 
breastfeeding can be prevented by measures to avoid breastfeeding during quizartinib therapy 
(see SmPC Section 4.4, “Special warnings and precautions for use” and SmPC Section 4.6, 
“Fertility, Pregnancy, and Lactation”). 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Embryo-foetal toxicity due to quizartinib can result in foetal death or severe congenital 
abnormalities.  The risks to the foetus should be weighed against the benefits of treatment in 
patients. 
Based on findings in animals, female and male fertility may be impaired with treatment with 
quizartinib. 
Potential public health impact:  
Rough estimates of the size of the target population of patients with ND AML, which is 
FLT3-ITD positive, are available.  The estimated size of the population expected to be treated 
with quizartinib is approximately 520 subjects per year in the 5 largest EU Member States 
(Germany, France, UK, Spain, and Italy), approximately 620 subjects per year in the US, and 
approximately 300 subjects per year in Japan.  
No estimates of the absolute risk of embryo-foetal or reproductive toxicity are available. 
In the short term, public health impact is expected to arise through the need for hospitalisation, 
potentially significant diagnostic and treatment efforts, antenatal and postnatal care for women, 
and children exposed to quizartinib during pregnancy.  In the long term, outcomes of significant 
permanent disabilities due to congenital abnormalities will impact public health with a need for 
rehabilitation and nursing support.  Impaired fertility due to previous quizartinib treatment may 
result in requirement for infertility treatment in the affected patients.  
Page 83 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Based on findings in animals, quizartinib may cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  No cases of embryo-foetal toxicity were observed in the clinical development 
programme. 
Based on findings in animals, female and male fertility may be impaired with quizartinib 
treatment.

MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
Risk Minimisation Plan  
All identified and potential safety concerns with quizartinib will be managed with routine risk 
minimisation activities, that is, the warnings and precaution information contained within the 
product information and package leaflet, and will be discussed in aggregate safety reports.  For 
each of the identified and potential safety concerns, in the context of observed efficacy in the 
target indication (ie, ND FLT3-ITD positive AML), the Investigator’s Brochure, the proposed 
SmPC, and package leaflet will be used to communicate and manage risk.  These safety 
reference documents will be periodically reviewed and updated in accordance with updated 
safety specifications and required action plans.  
For the important identified risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation, the 
Applicant is proposing additional risk minimisation measures in the form of a Healthcare 
Professional (HCP) Guide and a Patient Card (PC) (see Section Part IV:V.2 for details).

V.2 
Additional Risk Minimisation Measures 
For the important identified risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation , 
additional risk minimisation measures of an HCP Guide and a PC are proposed.  The proposed 
draft key messages of the additional risk minimisation activities are provided in Annex 6. 
Additional risk minimisation 1: HCP Guide 
Objectives: 
The objective of the HCP Guide is to reinforce prescriber’s awareness about the risk of serious 
ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation and the risk minimisation measures included in the 
quizartinib SmPC by providing HCPs with a reference guide about appropriate monitoring of 
QTc prolongation, how to appropriately interrupt or reduce the dose of quizartinib, and manage 
other risk factors for QTc prolongation, such as serum electrolyte abnormalities and concomitant 
QT-prolonging medications.  
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
A concise and easy-to-use reminder/reference material in the form of a 1-page HCP reference 
guide will improve the adherence to the key risk minimisation measures for the risk of serious 
ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation.  
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The target audience of the HCP will be prescribers of quizartinib.  All potential prescribers will 
be provided with the HCP Guide to keep and use as a reminder/quick reference material on 
initial placement on the product on the market, with periodic redistribution.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The Applicant will track and analyse the distribution rates of the HCP Guide among prescribers 
of VANFLYTA.  The incidence of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation in the 
postmarketing setting using routine pharmacovigilance activities will be evaluated and reported 
in each Periodic Safety Update Report. 
Additional risk minimisation 2: PC 
Objectives: 
The objective of the PC is intended to ensure that special information regarding VANFLYTA 
and the risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation is held by the patient at all 
times and reaches the relevant HCP as appropriate.  The PC will notify the patient, caregiver, or 
other treating HCP of the risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation, its signs and 
symptoms and the appropriate actions to be taken to prevent the occurrence of the risk. 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
HCPs who are not prescribers of VANFLYTA should be informed of the risk minimisation 
measures for VANFLYTA that impact on their clinical practice (eg, the risk of DDI with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors or medications with a QT-prolonging effect).  Patients/caregivers should be 
informed about the signs or symptoms of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation and 
when to seek attention from an HCP.  
Page 88 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The target audience of the PC will be patients receiving VANFLYTA and caregivers, and other 
treating HCPs providing care for the patient.  A key design feature of the PC will be the ability to 
carry the PC with ease (ie, it can fit in a wallet).  The PC will be included in each product pack. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The incidence of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation in the postmarketing setting 
using routine pharmacovigilance activities will be evaluated and reported in each Periodic Safety 
Update Report.

PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VANFLYTA 
(QUIZARTINIB DIHYDROCHLORIDE) 
This is a summary of the RMP for VANFLYTA.  The RMP details important risks of 
VANFLYTA and how these risks can be minimised. 
VANFLYTA’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to HCPs and patients on 
how VANFLYTA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for VANFLYTA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
VANFLYTA’s RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
VANFLYTA is indicated in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction 
and standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, followed by VANFLYTA single agent 
maintenance therapy for adult patients with ND AML that is FLT3-ITD positive (see SmPC 
Section 4.1 for the full indication).  It contains quizartinib as the active substance, and it is given 
by oral administration. 
Quizartinib is a potent oral second-generation Class III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 
potent activity against FLT3 both in vitro and in vivo.  FLT3 is expressed in blood-forming 
precursor cells, and signalling through FLT3 promotes these cells’ proliferation and 
differentiation.  FLT3 is mutated in approximately 30% of subjects with AML; the mutations 
include ITD of the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and point mutations, usually in the kinase 
domain.  Both types of mutations activate FLT3 and contribute to leukaemic transformation of 
blood-forming cells.  Quizartinib selectively inhibits survival pathways that block cell death by 
Page 90 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
inhibiting FLT3 receptor signalling.  Quizartinib thus inhibits proliferation of FLT3-dependent 
cell lines. 
Further information about the evaluation of VANFLYTA’s benefits can be found in 
VANFLYTA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of VANFLYTA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about VANFLYTA risks, are outlined below. 
  Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be the 
following: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs. 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(eg, with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of VANFLYTA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of VANFLYTA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of VANFLYTA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of VANFLYTA.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risks include QTc interval prolongation/torsade de pointes, DDIs with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors, and DDIs with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.  Important potential 
risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns include embryo-foetal and 
reproductive toxicity. 
Important Identified Risk 1: Serious ADRs Related to QTc Interval Prolongation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Dose dependent QTc prolongation was observed in the clinical 
development programme; QTcF prolongation was observed more 
frequently at quizartinib doses >60 mg.  Approximately 28% of 
subjects had TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged; however, most of these 
cases were mild and were manageable with dose modification or 
electrolyte correction, and very few events were serious or led to study 
drug discontinuation.  QTc interval prolongation is a risk factor for the 
development of severe or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, 
including torsade de pointes, which is associated with a significant risk 
of sudden cardiac death.  Torsade de pointes or other ventricular 
arrhythmias have been infrequently reported in the quizartinib clinical 
development programme.   
Recognised risk factors for QTc prolongation include hypokalaemia, 
hypomagnesemia or hypocalcaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, 
concomitant use of antiarrhythmic medicinal products or other 
medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative 
high-dose anthracycline therapy.  Other risk factors include baseline 
QT prolongation, subclinical long QT syndrome, cardiac history 
(eg, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, myocardial infarction), the 
elderly, and the female population.  Individual patient risk factors for 
the development of torsade de pointes include congenital or acquired 
long QT syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalaemia, 
hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcaemia), concomitant medications 
(eg, Class IA, Class IC, and Class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
phenothiazines, antiretroviral drugs, and tricyclic antidepressants), 
endocrine disorders, and cardiac disorders. 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as azole antifungals, increase 
quizartinib plasma exposure.  QTc interval prolongation has been 
shown to be dose and concentration dependent, and increased exposure

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Quizartinib 
Important Identified Risk 2: Increased Incidence of ADRs due to DDI with Strong 
CYP3A Inhibitors 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Concomitant use of quizartinib with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 
increased the exposure of quizartinib and its active metabolite 
AC886 compared to the use of quizartinib alone in healthy 
volunteers.  Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily 
for 28 days) with single-dose administration of quizartinib resulted 
in increased Cmax by 17% and AUCinf by 94%.  At steady state, 
exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) was estimated to be increased by 86% 
and 96%, respectively.  Increased quizartinib exposure may 
increase the risk of toxicity. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific risk factors are identified. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Recommendations for quizartinib dose adjustment if concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is described in Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Information on DDIs in Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
No additional risk minimisation measures. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-Foetal and Reproductive Toxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Based on findings in animals, quizartinib may cause embryo-foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  No cases of 
embryo-foetal toxicity were observed in the clinical development 
programme. 
Based on findings in animals, female and male fertility may be 
impaired with treatment with quizartinib. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific risk factors have been identified. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
Information on risk of embryo-foetal and reproductive toxicity in 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
No additional risk minimisation measures.

ANNEX 6  DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK 
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES  
Draft key messages of the additional risk minimisation measures: 
Prior to the launch of VANFLYTA in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) must agree on the content and format of the educational programme, including 
communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
National Competent Authority. 
The educational programme is aimed at reinforcing the prescriber’s and patient/caregiver’s 
awareness about the risk of serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation, and the actions to 
be taken to minimise the occurrence of the risk in patients receiving VANFLYTA.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where VANFLYTA is marketed, all HCPs and 
patients/caregivers who are expected to prescribe, dispense, and use VANFLYTA have access 
to/are provided with the following educational package: 
  Physician educational material 
  Patient information pack 
Physician educational material: 
  The SmPC 
  HCP Guide 
The HCP Guide will contain the following key elements: 
  Description of serious ADRS related to QTc interval prolongation that have occurred 
with quizartinib 
  Detailed description of the recommended VANFLYTA dosing regimen: starting dose and 
dose escalation criteria 
  Detailed description of VANFLYTA dose interruption, dose reduction, and treatment 
discontinuation based on QTc interval duration 
  VANFLYTA dose modification for concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors use 
  Management of other comedications that are known to cause QT prolongation 
  Frequency of ECG monitoring 
  Serum electrolyte monitoring and management 
The patient information pack: 
  Package leaflet 
  PC 
The PC will contain the following key elements: 
  A warning message for HCPs that VANFLYTA treatment may increase the risk of 
serious ADRs related to QTc interval prolongation  
 
Important information for HCPs not involved in the regular care of the patient about 
patient management related to QTc prolongation 
Page 99

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Granpidam 
sildenafil 
On 15 September 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Granpidam, 
intended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Accord Healthcare Ltd. 
Granpidam will be available as 20 mg film-coated tablets. The active substance of Granpidam is sildenafil, 
a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase 
type 5 (PDE5) (ATC code: G04BE03). Sildenafil increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle 
cells resulting in relaxation. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension this can lead to vasodilation 
of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation. 
Granpidam is a generic of Revatio, which has been authorised in the EU since 28 October 2005. Studies 
have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Granpidam and its bioequivalence to Viagra, a sildenafil-
containing medicine with the same qualitative composition as Revatio. A question and answer document 
on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is: 
“Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and 
III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and 
pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease.  
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown in 
primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease”. 
It is proposed that Granpidam be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension.

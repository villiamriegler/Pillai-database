Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Delstrigo 
doravirine / lamivudine / tenofovir disoproxil 
On 24 February 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Delstrigo. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2  
Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present 
evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
Delstrigo is also indicated for the treatment of adolescents aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 35 kg who are infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence 
of resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir and who have experienced 
toxicities which preclude the use of other regimens that do not contain tenofovir 
disoproxil (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

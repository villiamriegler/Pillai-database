Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for brimonidine (centrally authorised 
product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Within the four clinical studies discussed in this PUSA, ‘pallor’ or ‘over-whitening of the skin’ has been 
reported. The data indicates that between 3.9% to 18.9% of patients reported too much whitening, with 
between 0% to 9.3% of patients indicating that they were bothered by too much whitening.  
Cumulatively 119 post-marketing cases of pallor and skin discolouration have been reported. In 5 cases 
pallor was associated with systemic events such as hypotension which is already an identified adverse 
drug reaction of Mirvaso. In 114 cases there were no associated systemic events and these cases appear 
to represent a localised over-whitening effect. Only 1 case of pallor associated with the recommended use 
of Mirvaso was considered to be serious by the MAH. The majority of cases were associated with 
additional adverse drug reactions such as erythema, flushing, skin burning sensation, condition 
aggravated and rash. Nineteen (19) of the cases of localised pallor were not associated with any other 
adverse events; only 5 out of these 19 patients discontinued treatment as a result of the pallor.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pallor and over-whitening, the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information are warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for brimonidine (centrally authorised product only) the CHMP is 
of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brimonidine (centrally 
authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

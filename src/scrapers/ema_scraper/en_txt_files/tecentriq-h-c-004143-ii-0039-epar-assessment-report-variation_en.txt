2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It occurs in patients 
with chronic liver inflammation due to HBV, HCV, excessive alcohol intake or other toxins such as 
aflatoxin. Furthermore, haemochromatosis, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, metabolic syndrome and 
NASH increase the risk of HCC. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 7/126 
 
 
 
Epidemiology 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer type in the world, and the fourth 
most deadly cancer (Globocan 2018). There are over 700,000 new cases diagnosed each year 
worldwide with large geographic variation in both risk factors and incidence (El-Serag 2011, Ferlay et 
al. 2010). HCC is the fifth most common cancer in Europe and has been predicted to be responsible for 
77,400 deaths in Europe in 2018. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal disease with a mortality to incidence rate ratio of 
0.98 and 0.95 in males and females, respectively (Kamangar et al. 2006). Up to 80% of patients first 
presenting with HCC have advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease because of the late 
appearance of symptoms. 
Biologic features 
The majority (> 80%) of cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Asia, and China alone accounts 
for  55%  of  cases  worldwide.  Hepatitis B  virus  (HBV)  infection  is  the  main  risk  factor  for  HCC  in  Asia 
(> 70%), while in Western countries and Japan, the main risk factor is Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
(50% to 70%) and excessive alcohol intake (20%), along with other causes of cirrhosis (10%) (Llovet 
et al. 2003). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
It is a medically complex and difficult to treat disease as the majority of HCC patients have underlying 
cirrhosis requiring management of both the malignancy and underlying liver disease. HCC patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic disease have a poor prognosis, with rapid progression and short OS.   
Management 
Sorafenib remains as the global standard of care for treatment of patients with unresectable HCC based 
on  two  multicenter,  randomized,  double−blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase III  trials:  the  Sorafenib  HCC 
Assessment  Randomized  Protocol  (SHARP)  trial  in  Western  regions  and  a  trial  conducted  in  the  Asia-
Pacific region (Asia-Pacific Trial) (Llovet et al. 2008, Cheng et al. 2009). Both studies demonstrated a 
survival benefit of sorafenib vs. placebo. Sorafenib is often poorly tolerated, and dose reductions or drug 
discontinuations due to AEs are common (Llovet et al. 2008).   
Recently, treatment with lenvatinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was shown to be 
non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint of OS (lenvatinib vs. sorafenib hazard 
ratio HR 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79, 1.06; non-inferiority margin = 1.08) (REFLECT, Kudo et al. 
2018). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Tecentriq  (atezolizumab)  is  an  Fc-engineered  humanised  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  monoclonal 
antibody  that  binds  to  programmed  death−ligand  1  (PD-L1)  and  inhibits  its  interactions  with 
programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1 receptors, both of which can provide inhibitory signals to T cells. 
Avastin (bevacizumab) is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits

the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both in vitro and in vivo assay 
systems. 
Combining anti–PD-L1 and anti-VEGF therapies has shown synergy and positive outcomes in Phase I to 
III studies, particularly in settings where high VEGF levels are known to play an important role in tumor 
growth  (Chen  and  Hurwitz  2018).  HCC  is  a  highly  vascularised  tumor  in  which  several  proangiogenic 
factors play a role in its pathogenesis. In HCC, increased VEGF correlates with vascular density, tumor 
invasiveness and metastasis, and poor prognosis (Frenette 2012; Boige et al. 2012). In addition, VEGF-
A signaling is known to activate angiogenesis-independent, inductive angiocrine signals from sinusoidal 
endothelium that  stimulate  hepatocyte-mediated liver regeneration  (LeCouter  et  al.  2003;  Ding  et  al. 
2010). 
In addition to its role in angiogenesis and liver regeneration, the VEGF-A pathway also plays a crucial 
role  in  exerting  and  maintaining  an  immunosuppressive  tumor  microenvironment  through  several 
mechanisms.  For instance, VEGF-A has been shown to induce Fas ligand (FasL) expression on endothelial 
cells,  which  have  the  ability  to  kill  effector  CD8+  T  cells,  but  not  T-reg  cells  (Motz  et  al.  2014). 
Administration of anti-VEGF-A attenuated tumor endothelial FasL expression and produced a significant 
increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8+ over FoxP3+ T cells, which was FasL-dependent, and led 
to CD8-dependent tumor growth suppression (Motz et al. 2014). Furthermore, bevacizumab can restore 
and/or maintain the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells, leading to enhanced T-cell infiltration 
in tumors (Oelkrug et al 2014; Wallin et al. 2016).  In addition to increased trafficking of T cells into 
tumors  (Manning  et  al.  2007),  several  publications have  illustrated  that  anti-VEGF  therapies  can  also 
reduce frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, decrease production of suppressive cytokines, and 
lower expression of inhibitory checkpoints on CD8+ T cells in tumors (Roland et al. 2009; Voron et al. 
2015). Therefore, the immunomodulatory effect of bevacizumab is expected to increase CD8-positive 
T-cell  recruitment  and  relieve  intratumoral  immunosuppression,  thereby  boosting  the  effects  of 
atezolizumab. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The  clinical  development  of  atezolizumab  in  unresectable  HCC  comprises  one  pivotal  Phase III  study 
(IMbrave150), and three supportive Phase I studies (GO30140, PCD4989g, and YO29233). In addition, 
a  Phase  III  study  (WO41535  [IMbrave050])  of  Atezo  +  Bev  versus  active  surveillance  as  adjuvant 
therapy in HCC patients at high risk of recurrence after surgical resection or ablation is currently ongoing. 
The  Sponsor  sought  Scientific  Advice  feedback  on  the  proposed  Phase III  study  design  (IMbrave150) 
from  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  and  received  a  written  advice  in 
November 2017. 
Overall, the CHMP supported the proposed Phase III study design with Atezo + Bev in unresectable HCC; 
the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  proposed  study  population,  the  study  design  including  the  comparator 
(sorafenib) and stratification factors, the statistical analysis plan and the planned safety database. 
The CHMP did not fully support the open-label design of the study as they considered double-blind design 
feasible.  However,  the  CHMP  noted  that  with  OS  as  the  primary  endpoint,  this  may  not  be  a  critical 
concern.    The  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  having  ORR  by  investigator  as  co-primary  endpoint  with  the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 9/126 
 
 
 
concern being that it could lead to a potential premature end of the study not allowing to capture final 
OS. The Sponsor consequently changed the co-primary endpoint of ORR by investigator to PFS by IRF 
per RECIST v1.1. In addition, the CHMP did not encourage the inclusion of an interim analysis for OS. 
However, in case the Sponsor decided to include an interim analysis, it was noted that randomization 
should be retained to ensure final OS data could be captured and trial integrity maintained. 
The applicant held separate meetings with the Rapporteur (Danish Medicines Agency) and Co-Rapporteur 
(Paul-Ehrlich-Institute) in December 2018 to discuss the acceptability of a proposed filing strategy and 
content based on the Phase Ib Study GO30140, to provide updated efficacy and safety data from Arm A 
of Study GO30140 and to provide an update on the ongoing HCC clinical development plan.  In general, 
both Agencies did not recommend the filing based on single arm Phase Ib data due to the exploratory 
nature of such studies and the limitations associated with non-randomized comparisons. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The study was conducted in compliance with GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, a protein 
with a molecular mass of ~150 kDa. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the 
patient’s body by regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, atezolizumab is unlikely to result in 
a significant environmental exposure. Atezolizumab is expected to biodegrade in the environment and 
does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), 
atezolizumab is exempt from the submission of Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product 
and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been provided for this extension. No further data is required. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical pharmacology evaluations of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (herein referred to as Atezo + 
Bev) are based on pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data obtained from four clinical studies where 
atezolizumab was administered as a single agent or in combination with bevacizumab to HCC patients. 
All atezolizumab and bevacizumab doses were administered as an IV infusion.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK in Study IMbrave150 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  collected  in  the  Phase  III  Study  YO40245  (hereafter  referred  to  as 
“IMbrave150”),  which  was  an  open-label,  randomized  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 11/126 
 
 
 
 
atezolizumab  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  compared  with  sorafenib  for  patients  with  previously 
untreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC.  
Table 2: Number of PK samples and patients included or excluded in the atezolizumab analysis 
PopPK analysis was performed using NONMEM, Version 7.4 and perl-speaks-NONMEM, Version 4.8.1 was 
used to evaluate/validate the popPK model using predictive checks. Data, exploration and visualisation 
of the data as well as descriptive statistics were performed using R V3.3.3 in addition to CRAN packages. 
The Phase I popPK model PK parameter estimates were fixed to final estimates to perform a Bayesian 
post-hoc  estimation  based  on  IMbrave150  data  and  estimate  patient-level  random  effect  and  PK 
parameters. The goodness-of fit plots suggest that the model was able to describe the PK profiles well 
and no trend was observed in goodness-of fit plots at the individual level. The pcVPC suggested that the 
median, 95th, and 5th percentiles of observed Cmax and Cmin were generally well within the prediction 
intervals of the Phase I popPK model, see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Prediction-corrected VPC of peaks and troughs of atezolizumab (all patients, semi-log scale) 
(study IMbrave150) 
The  effects  of  baseline  body  weight,  albumin,  tumour  burden,  ADA,  and  gender,  indicated  that  the 
relationships estimated in the Phase I popPK model adequately described trends in IMbrave150 study. 
The  positive  correlation  (p<0.001)  between  albumin  and  CL  suggested  a  less  steep  relationship  in 
IMbrave150 patients than the one estimated in the Phase I popPK model, and the positive correlation 
(p<0.001) between body weight and V2 appears to be a possible relationship specific for HCC. Age, race, 
number of metastatic sites, ECOG performance status, CRCL, eGFR, and platelet count did not appear 
to affect atezolizumab pharmacokinetics using IMbrave150 data. No covariate effect was related to liver 
function, i.e. ALT, AST, bilirubin, and LDH. No consistent trend in random effects was observed between 
hepatic  impairment  categories  although  there  was  an  increasing  trend  in  Eta.  CL  of  patients  with 
moderate hepatic impairment was lower than that of patients with either normal liver function or mild 
hepatic impairment. The number of patients with severe hepatic impairment (N = 2) was too small for 
comparison. There was no association between aetiology, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, 
alcohol use, or alpha-fetoprotein level (<400 ng/mL or ≥400 ng/mL) and atezolizumab PK.

Absorption 
Atezolizumab is administered as an IV infusion. There have been no clinical studies performed with other 
routes of administration. 
Distribution 
PopPK analysis indicate that V1 is 3.28 L and Vss is 6.91 L in the typical patient. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 14/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
PopPK analysis indicate that the typical CL of atezolizumab is 0.200 L/day and the typical terminal t1/2 
is 27 days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The previously developed popPK model estimated geometric mean accumulation ratio for Cmin, Cmax, 
and AUC was 2.75, 1.46, and 1.91-fold, respectively, following multiple dose administration of 
atezolizumab q3w days. The observed extent of accumulation is in close agreement with that predicted 
based on the popPK reported t1/2 of 27 days dosed q3w. Atezolizumab PK was linear over a dose 
range of 1 to 20 mg/kg of atezolizumab, including the fixed 1200 mg dose of atezolizumab. 
Based on simulations, 90% of steady-state is attained after the following median (range) number of 
cycles: 3 cycles (1-6), 2 cycles (1-4), and 3 cycles (1-5) for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC, respectively. 
The summary of the individual exposure metrics (IMbrave150) at cycle 1 and at steady-state based on 
the Phase 1 popPK Model is presented in the Tables below. The geometric mean accumulation ratio 
based on AUC was 2-fold. Cmin and Cmax accumulated 2.3- and 1.5-fold (geometric means), 
respectively.

Atezolizumab concentrations after 1200 mg q3w across studies 
Exposures of Atezo + Bev in IMbrave150 were consistent with those observed in prior studies in HCC 
patients which followed the same 1200 mg q3w regimen of atezolizumab, indicating that the addition 
of bevacizumab therapy did not affect the PK of atezolizumab.

Following Multiple IV Doses of Atezolizumab 1200 mg Given Every 3 Weeks 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Dose rationale 
Both GO30140 (Arms A and F1) and IMbrave150 (Atezo + Bev) evaluated atezolizumab administered at 
a fixed dose of 1200 mg by IV infusion q3w in combination with 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab by IV q3w in 
patients with metastatic and/or unresectable HCC (see supportive studies). 
Atezolizumab administered at a fixed dose of 1200 mg q3w (1200 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle), 
is an approved dosage for atezolizumab. Anti-tumor activity has been observed across doses ranging 
from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg q3w. In the Phase I Study GO27831 (PCD4989g, Report No. 1064914) the 
maximum tolerated dose of atezolizumab was not reached and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed 
at any dose. The fixed dose of 1200 mg q3w (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 15 
mg/kg q3w) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies (Deng et al. 2016) and available clinical 
PK, efficacy, and safety data. 
Bevacizumab administered at a fixed dose of 15 mg/kg q3w on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle is an approved 
dosage for bevacizumab (see Avastin approved label). The 15 mg/kg q3w dose of bevacizumab aligns 
with the  atezolizumab  dosing  schedule  (1200  mg q3w),  and  is  also  the  dosage  used  in  the  GO30140 
(Arms A and F1) and IMbrave150 studies (Atezo+Bev) in combination with atezolizumab. This dose was 
generally well-tolerated, the incidence and severity of bevacizumab AESIs with combination of Atezo+ 
Bev in the overall population of Arm A (N = 104) and Arm F1 (N = 60) of study GO30140, as well as in 
the  IMbrave150  study  was  consistent  with  that  reported  in  the  bevacizumab label  indicating  that  the 
addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab does not exacerbate the incidence or severity of bevacizumab 
AESIs. 
Mechanism of action 
Atezolizumab targets human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor-infiltrating immune cells 
(ICs) and tumor cells (TCs), and inhibits its interaction with its receptors, PD-1 and B7.1 (CD80, B7-1). 
Both of these interactions are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells. 
Bevacizumab targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a pleiotropic inflammatory 
factor that is normally associated with wound repair. VEGF and angiogenesis is an essential factor in 
the oncogenic process, and plays a role in pathogenesis. VEGF is associated with vascular density, 
tumor invasiveness and metastasis, and poor prognosis (Frenette 2012; Boige et al. 2012).

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
•  Study IMbrave150 
Blood samples were collected to characterize atezolizumab PK and ADA incidence following 
atezolizumab treatment. Serum samples for PK and ADA analysis were obtained at multiple timepoints 
before, during, and after treatment with atezolizumab (Table 9). 
Table 8: IMbrave150: Atezolizumab ADA and PK Sampling Schedule 
Atezolizumab Immunogenicity Rates 
The incidence of treatment-emergent atezolizumab ADAs in the Atezo+Bev arm is within the range of 
treatment-emergent ADA-positive incidence rates observed across atezolizumab studies. 
Table 9: IMbrave150: Baseline Prevalence and Post-Baseline Incidence of ADAs to Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab pharmacokinetics by ADA status 
Atezolizumab concentrations up to Cycle 16 Day 1 by ADA status are summarized in Table 11 for all 
PK-evaluable atezolizumab-treated patients. The arithmetic mean Cmax values at Cycle 1 were 408 
and 372 μg/mL for ADA-negative and ADA-positive patients, respectively, a difference of 8.82% (Table 
11). The corresponding Cmin values at Cycle 1, Day 21 (i.e., Predose Cycle 2), were 89.3 and 54.4 
μg/mL, respectively, a difference of 39.1%. The vast majority of patients had Cmin above the target 
exposure of 6 μg/mL, regardless of ADA status.

Table 11: Summary statistics (mean [SD]) and t-test on atezolizumab clearance and exposure metrics 
by ADA status 
There was significant difference (p<0.001) between atezolizumab clearance in ADA positive patients and 
ADA negative patients. A substantial difference was also observed for other exposure metrics (i.e., Cmin 
and  AUC0-21)  with  lower exposure in  ADA  positive patients  compared  to  ADA  negative  patients,  less 
pronounced for Cmax.

Incidence of ADAs across studies (GO30140, IMbrave150 and pooled analysis) 
The pre-treatment ADA prevalence and post-treatment ADA incidence for atezolizumab is shown in 
Table 12 for IMbrave150 and GO30140. The ADA prevalence at baseline was 2.3% for atezolizumab-
treated patients with a baseline ADA sample in IMbrave150, and 0%, 3.4%, and 3.4%, respectively for 
Arms A, F1, and F2 of GO30140. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 19/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-treatment, the atezolizumab ADA incidence rates were 27.9% in IMbrave150, and 23.8%, 37.9% 
and 29.8% in Arms A, F1, and F2, respectively, of GO30140 as shown in Table 12. These are within 
the range of treatment-emergent ADA incidence rates observed across atezolizumab studies. For Arm 
F2 of GO30140, ADA samples obtained post crossover were not used for ADA status derivation. 
When pooled across the two studies evaluating atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment in HCC there 
were 134 of 474 ADA-evaluable patients who developed treatment-emergent ADAs to atezolizumab 
(incidence rate of 28.3%). 
Table 12: Baseline Prevalence and Post-Baseline Incidence of ADAs to Atezolizumab 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Samples received for determination of atezolizumab concentrations in serum from HCC patients were 
analysed  within  established  sample  storage  stability  using  validated  analytical  methods.  For  the 
IMbrave150  Phase  III  study  conducted  in  HCC  patients,  the  in-study  validation  was  acceptable  and 
incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  performed  and  met  the  acceptance  criteria.  All  analyses  including 
assessment of immunogenicity were conducted with assays assessed in previous procedures.  
The  IMbrave150  study  was  an  open-label,  randomized  study  to  investigate the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
atezolizumab  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  compared  with  sorafenib  for  patients  with  previously 
untreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC. Pharmacokinetic data collected in IMbrave 150 was used 
for external validation of the Phase I PopPK model, with determination of individual Bayesian estimates 
for  the  HCC  patients.  The  phase  I  PopPK  model  could  reasonably  well  describe  the  atezolizumab 
concentrations of IMbrave150, although some overprediction was observed for Ctrough. VPCs stratified for 
ADA status showed overprediction at Cycle 1 Ctrough for ADA positives whereas the fit was acceptable for 
ADA negatives. Overprediction was also observed of Ctroughs for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(NCI-ODWG Group B1+B2). The Phase 1 popPK model was used to estimate the exposure metrics after 
multiple injections of 1200 mg q3w atezolizumab. The predicted exposure of atezolizumab in IMbrave 
150 was comparable to the exposure achieved in other studies with atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w dosing, 
with or without bevacizumab and across indications. Atezolizumab administered at a fixed dose of 1200 
mg  q3w  is  already  approved  hence  the  dose  rationale  for  treatment  of  HCC  patients  is  considered 
acceptable. The incidence of ADAs in the Atezo+Bev arm of IMbrave150 was 27.9% which is within what 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 20/126 
 
 
 
 
has  been  observed  in  other  atezolizumab  indications.  Atezolizumab  clearance  was  significantly  lower 
(p<0.001)  in  ADA  positive  patients  as  compared  to ADA  negative  patients.  NAb  data  for  IMbrave150 
were submitted and showed that 65 patients out of 313 evaluable patients had neutralising antibodies 
(88/315 patients were ADA positive).  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall atezolizumab PK is sufficiently described and no apparent differences are detected compared to 
the previous description of PK following 1200 mg q3w IV administered as monotherapy and in other 
indications.  
The  analysis  of  immunogenicity  revealed  that  atezolizumab  exposure  and  efficacy  was  lower  in  ADA-
positive as compared to ADA-negative patients (see also 2.4.2. Main Study).

Sample size 
A total of approximately 480 patients was planned to be randomized in the global enrolment phase of 
this study, using a 2:1 randomization ratio to allocate patients to either the atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab arm (Arm A) or the sorafenib arm (Arm B).  
The sample size of the study was determined based on the number of deaths required to demonstrate 
efficacy in terms of OS. To detect an improvement in OS using a log-rank test at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.048, approximately 312 deaths were considered to be required to achieve 80% 
overall power assuming a target HR of 0.71 (median OS improvement vs. control is 4.9 months).  
Randomisation 
IMbrave150 was a randomized study. After written informed consent had been obtained, all screening 
procedures and assessments had been completed, and eligibility had been established for a patient, the 
study site obtained the patient's identification number and treatment assignment from the interactive 
voice or web-based response system (IxRS). Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms, 
Atezo+Bev or sorafenib, according to a 2:1 randomization ratio using a permuted-block randomization 
method. 
Randomization was stratified according to the following stratification factors:  
•  Geographic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world)  
•  Macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence)  
•  Baseline AFP (<400 vs. ≥400 ng/mL)  
• 
ECOG Performance Status (0 vs 1) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Co-primary Endpoint: Overall Survival 
To  detect  an  improvement  in  OS  using  a  log-rank  test  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.048., 
approximately  312  deaths  were  required  at  the  final  OS  analysis  to  achieve  an  overall  80%  power 
assuming a target hazard ratio (HR) of 0.71 (median OS improvement vs. control of 4.9 months). The 
minimum detectable difference (MDD) of OS is an HR of 0.783 (median OS improvement vs. control of 
3.3 months). This analysis is expected to occur approximately 33 months after first-patient in (FPI). The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy in the ITT population with regard to 
OS were based on the following assumptions: 
Patients were to be randomized to the Atezo+Bev and Sorafenib arms in a 2:1 ratio 
• 
•  OS followed a one-piece exponential distribution 
• 
• 
The median OS in the control arm was to be 12 months 
The stopping boundaries of two interim analyses and the final analysis of OS were to use the 
O'Brien-Fleming boundaries approximated using the Lan-DeMets method 
The dropout rate was to be 5% for the Atezo+Bev arm and 10% for the Sorafenib arm over 12 
months for OS 
The recruitment of approximately 480 patients was to take place over approximately 10 months 
• 
• 
Co-Primary Endpoint: Progression-Free Survival by IRF Assessment per RECIST v1.1 
To detect an improvement in Progression-Free Survival per RECIST v1.1 by Independent Review Facility 
(IRF-PFS)  using  a  log-rank  test  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.002,  approximately  308  events 
were  required  for the  primary  PFS  analysis  to  achieve  approximately  97%  power  with  a target  HR  of 
0.55 (median PFS improvement vs. control of 3.3 months). The MDD was a PFS HR of 0.688 (median 
PFS improvement vs. control of 1.8 months). The clinical cutoff date for this primary PFS analysis was 
expected to occur approximately 16 months after the first patient was enrolled in the study. 
The estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy in the ITT population with regard 
to PFS were based on the following assumptions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients were to be randomized to the Atezo+Bev and Sorafenib arms in a 2:1 ratio 
PFS followed a one-piece exponential distribution 
The median PFS in the control arm was to be 4 months 
The dropout rate was to be 5% for the Atezo+Bev arm and 10% for the Sorafenib arm over 12 
months for PFS 
The recruitment of approximately 480 patients was to take place over approximately 10 months 
Overall Type I Error Control 
The overall type I error rate for this study was controlled at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 by a 
graphical approach, i.e., alpha splitting and recycling. The overall two-sided significance level of 0.05 
was split into a two-sided significance level of 0.048 for the testing of OS and a two-sided significance 
level of 0.002 for the testing of PFS initially. If OS was statistically significant, the allocated two-sided 
significance  level  of  0.048  could  be  recycled  to  PFS  such  that  PFS  could  be  tested  at  a  two-sided 
significance level of 0.05 instead of 0.002. If the analysis of PFS was statistically significant, then the 
two-sided significance level of 0.002 (or 0.05 if OS was statistically significant) was to be recycled to key 
secondary endpoints (IRF-assessed ORR according to RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST) to be formally 
tested in a hierarchical fashion. If PFS and both key secondary endpoints were statistically significant at 
a two-sided significance level of 0.002, then OS could be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 
instead  of  0.048.  An  overview  of  the  type  I  error  rate  control  strategy  for  the  co-primary  and  key 
secondary efficacy endpoints is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Overview of the type I error control for co-primary and key secondary endpoints 
Multiplicity Control for Key Secondary Endpoints 
If the co-primary endpoint of IRF-PFS according to RECIST v1.1 was statistically significant, then ORR-
IRF (confirmation required) according to RECIST v1.1 and ORR-IRF (confirmation required) according to 
HCC mRECIST were to be hierarchically tested. Specifically, ORR-IRF per RECIST v1.1 was to be tested 
first and if it was statistically significant, ORR-IRF per HCC mRECIST was then to be tested. If ORR-IRF 
per  RECIST  v1.1  was  not  statistically  significant,  ORR-IRF  per  HCC  mRECIST  was  not  to  be  tested. 
Implementation of this ordered statistical testing procedure will strongly control the type I error at 5% 
(two-sided)  among  all  key  hypotheses.  The  key  secondary  endpoints  (ORR-IRF  per  RECIST  v1.1  and 
ORR-IRF per HCC mRECIST) were to be tested at a two-sided alpha of 0.002 if the co-primary endpoint 
PFS-IRF per RECIST v1.1 has reached statistical significance at a two-sided alpha of 0.002, but OS has 
not reached statistical significance at the first interim analysis that was to be conducted at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis. On the other hand, if both co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS have reached 
statistical significance at the specified two-sided alpha level at the time of the primary PFS analysis, key 
secondary endpoints were to be tested at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. 
Analysis Timing 
There  were  no  interim  analyses  planned  for  the  co-primary  endpoint  of  IRF=PFS  in  this  study.  The 
primary analysis of IRF-PFS per RECIST v1.1 was to be conducted when approximately 308 PFS events 
had occurred in the ITT population. The clinical cutoff date for this primary PFS analysis was expected 
to occur approximately 16 months after the first patient was enrolled in the study. 
Two interim analyses were planned to be conducted for OS. The first interim analysis was to be performed 
at the time of the primary PFS analysis. It was anticipated that at that time, approximately 172 deaths 
would have been observed. The respective MDD OS hazard ratio was 0.633 (median OS improvement 
vs.  control  of  6.9  months).  The  second  OS  interim  analysis  is  planned  to  be  conducted  when 
approximately 243 deaths have been accumulated, estimated to occur approximately 24 months after 
the first patient was enrolled in the study. The respective MDD OS hazard ratio is 0.728 (median OS 
improvement vs. control of 4.6 months).  
The  respective  MDD  OS  hazard  ratio  for  the  final  OS  analysis  is  0.783  (median  OS  improvement  vs. 
control of 3.3 months).

In total, 725 patients were screened for entry into this study and 224 patients failed screening based 
on information collected on the IxRS. The most common specified reasons for screen failure included: 
• 
• 
inadequate hematologic and end-organ function (n=49) 
non-Child-Pugh Class A (n=29) 
•  withdrawal of consent (n=17)  
• 
• 
•

Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival based on IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 (ITT 
population) – cut-off date: 29 August 2019 
The MAH has computed adjusted p-values for all efficacy endpoints that were formally tested (co-primary 
endpoints: OS and IRF-assessed PFS per RECIST version 1.1; key secondary endpoints: IRF-assessed 
ORR per RECIST v1.1 and per HCC modified RECIST) using the method described in Bretz et al. 2009.  
These adjusted p-values adjust for multiplicity of the co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, 
in the context of the group-sequential design of OS (as described in the protocol), and therefore are to 
be compared with the overall two-sided alpha of 0.05.  Table 31 lists the unadjusted observed p-values 
as reported in the IMbrave150 CSR (versus the respective multiplicity adjusted alpha boundaries) and 
the respective adjusted p-values (versus alpha boundary of 0.05, two-sided) for the co-primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints that were formally tested in IMbrave150.  All p-values, confidence intervals, 
alpha boundaries in Table 31 are two sided.  The statistical testing conclusions remain the same after 
the adjustment.

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis 
The impact of missing scheduled tumour assessments on the co-primary efficacy endpoint of PFS based 
on IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 was assessed. In this analysis, patients who missed two or more 
consecutive tumor assessments scheduled immediately prior to the date of PD or death in any treatment 
arm were censored at the last tumor assessment prior to the missed visit. 
Table 34: Sensitivity analysis for PFS based on IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 censored for missing 
visits (ITT population) 
The MAH has conducted the two requested sensitivity analyses for the co-primary endpoint of PFS as 
assessed by IRF per RECIST version 1.1. 
Sensitivity Analysis 1: Patients who missed ≥  1 consecutive tumor assessments immediately prior to 
progressive disease (PD) or death are counted as event at the last tumor assessment prior to the missed 
visit; 
Sensitivity Analysis 2: Patients who missed ≥  2 consecutive tumor assessments immediately prior to 
PD or death are counted as event at the last tumor assessment prior to the missed visit.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
• 
Immunogenicity of bevacizumab 
Study GO30140  
The treatment-emergent ADA incidence rate for bevacizumab in study GO30140 was low, ranging 
between 2.1%-3.8% for the two atezolizumab plus bevacizumab arms. This is in line with ADA 
incidence rates for bevacizumab that have been reported in other clinical studies across indications. 
Study IMbrave150 
No sampling for bevacizumab ADAs was conducted in study IMbrave150 due to the low post-treatment 
incidence of bevacizumab ADAs observed across earlier studies in combination with atezolizumab. 
• 
Immunogenicity of atezolizumab 
The treatment-emergent atezolizumab ADA incidence rate was 27.9% in IMbrave150 and ranged from 
23.8% to 37.9% across all HCC studies (studies GO30140, PCD4989g, and YO29233). The median 
time to onset of ADA in IMbrave150 was 3.14 weeks.

Efficacy by landmark ADA status in IMbrave150 
A separate immunogenicity report for study IMbrave150 was provided, where additional analyses were 
presented to account for imbalances in baseline demographics and prognostic factors between ADA 
subgroups that could confound the estimation of treatment effect compared with control (data not 
shown).  
Supportive studies 
Phase Ib Study GO30140 
Study GO30140 is an ongoing open-label, multi-center, global Phase Ib study with non-randomized 
and randomized arms evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab when 
administered with bevacizumab and/or other treatments in patients with different solid tumours.  
Arm A of Study GO30140 was a non-randomized single-arm cohort designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of Atezo + Bev in patients with advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC who had 
not received prior systemic therapy (n=104). The primary efficacy endpoint of Arm A was confirmed 
ORR by IRF per RECIST v1.1. No statistical testing was applied in Arm A of GO30140. 
Arm F of Study GO30140 randomized 119 patients open-label in a 1:1 ratio to the combination 
treatment of Atezo + Bev (Arm F1) or atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm F2) to characterize the single 
agent contribution to the combination treatment effect in advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable 
HCC patients without prior systemic therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of Arm F was PFS by IRF 
per RECIST v1.1. Arm F was statistically-powered at a two-sided significance level of 0.2 for the 
primary efficacy endpoint. 
Figure 16: Overview of Study Design for GO30140 
Eligibility criteria 
Patients with locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC who had received no prior 
systemic therapy were included. At baseline, patients had documented virology status of hepatitis, at 
least one measurable untreated lesion (per RECIST v1.1), ECOG PS score of 0 or 1, and adequate 
hematologic and end-organ function. Both studies excluded patients who had co-infection of hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), or with untreated or incompletely treated oesophageal and/or 
gastric varices with bleeding or high-risk for bleeding. Patients with vascular invasion of the portal or 
hepatic veins were eligible for both studies. In Arm F of GO30140, patients with Child-Pugh A were 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 56/126 
 
 
 
 
eligible; Arm A allowed enrolment of patients with Child-Pugh score up to B7. Eligibility criteria 
regarding life expectancy were only included in GO30140 Arm F, with patients being eligible for the 
study only if their life expectancy status was determined by the Investigator as ≥ 3 months.  
Schedule of Tumour Assessments 
In study GO30140 tumour assessments were done at baseline, then every 8 (± 1) weeks for the first 
12 months, and every 12 (± 3) weeks thereafter (as opposed to IMbrave150 with more frequent 
assessments every 6 (± 1) weeks for the first 54 weeks and 9 (± 1) weeks thereafter).

Outcomes and estimation 
The timing (clinical cutoff date of 14 June 2019) for the analyses presented was driven by the event 
requirements for the primary PFS analysis in Arm F of GO30140, which were met with 74 PFS events 
observed across both treatment arms. The primary analysis of Arm A was conducted at the same time 
as the primary analysis of Arm F. 
The primary analysis for Arm A was performed approximately 10.5 months after the last patient was 
enrolled in Arm A. The median duration of survival follow-up was 12.4 months (range 0.7-34.3) in Arm 
A.  
The primary analysis for Arm F was performed approximately 3 months after the last patient was 
randomized into Arm F. The median duration of survival follow-up was 6.6 months (range 1.0-11.9) in 
Arm F1 and 6.7 months (range 0.5-11.4) in Arm F2.

The median duration of response could not be estimated at the time of the clinical data cutoff date. As 
of that date, all of the 12 responders in the Atezo+Bev arm and 8 of the 10 responders in the Atezo 
monotherapy arm were ongoing. 
Overall survival results were not mature at the time of the primary PFS analysis, 16 patients (26.7%) 
in the Atezo+Bev arm and 18 patients (30.5%) in the Atezo monotherapy arm had died. This resulted 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

in a stratified HR of 0.78 (80% CI: 0.50, 1.21). The 6-month OS rate was 88% for the Atezo+Bev 
patients and 76% for the patients in the Atezo monotherapy arm. 
Intra-study crossover was allowed from Atezolizumab monotherapy to the combination treatment (26 
patients crossed over from Atezo monotherapy (Arm F2) to treatment with Atezo + Bev after 
Investigator-assessed disease progression. 
- Updated OS results based on a CCOD of 15 October 2019 provide approximately 4 months of 
additional follow-up for patients as compared to the primary analysis. At the updated CCOD for Arm F, 
25 patients (41.7%) of 60 ITT patients in the Atezo + Bev arm and 25 patients (42.4%) of 59 ITT 
patients in the Atezo monotherapy arm had died.

Additional studies 
Table 50: Summary of Additional Studies 
Atezolizumab Monotherapy 
Atezolizumab administered as single-agent for the treatment of HCC has been assessed in PCD4989g 
and YO29233 multi-cohort Phase I studies.  
•  Study PCD4989g 
As of the last patient last visit (LPLV) of 30 September 2018, there were 15 patients with HCC treated 
with atezolizumab in PCD4989g (n=5 1L patients, n=10 2L+ patients). None (95% CI: 0.0, 21.8) of 
the patients with HCC had a confirmed objective response as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 
v1.1, two 1L patients achieved SD. Of note, two out of five 1L patients (40%) were alive by the time of 
the LPLV based on a median duration of survival follow-up of 23.7 months (range 2.2 to 31) for 1L 
HCC patients. 
•  Study YO29233 
In the analysis of Study YO29233 based on a CCOD of 19 November 2018, there were 20 patients 
from the HCC expansion cohort, and 1 patient from the PK cohort treated with Atezo. All patients were 
Chinese, and were reported to have HBV as a cause of HCC disease. Among those patients, 7 received 
atezolizumab as 1L treatment and 14 as 2L+ treatment. 2 1L HCC patients (28.6%) had a confirmed 
Investigator-assessed PR per RECIST v1.1. One of those responses was ongoing (DOR of 14.0+ 
months) while the other responder had discontinued treatment due to disease progression (DOR of 6.9 
months). No 2L+ HCC patients achieved a confirmed response. 
Bevacizumab Monotherapy 
Bevacizumab as a single-agent for the treatment of HCC has been assessed in the Investigator-
sponsored trials of Siegel et al. 2008 and Boige et al 2012. 
• 
Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Unresectable HCC *Siegel et al., J Clin Oncol. 2008; 26(18) 
In the study conducted by Siegel et al. 2008, 46 adult patients (15 [33%] 1L, 31 [67%] 2L) with 
organ-confined HCC, ECOG PS of 0-2, and compensated liver function (Child-Pugh A or B7), received 
bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q2W until disease progression or treatment-limiting toxicity. Of 
note, patients with MVI, EHS, or greater than 50% tumor involvement in the liver were excluded.  
The primary objective was to determine whether bevacizumab improved the 6-month progression-free 
survival (PFS) rate from 40% to 60%. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 68/126 
 
 
 
 
Forty-six patents were enrolled between February 2003 and September 2006. The median age was 58 
years. Eighty-three percent of patients were male, and 95% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. One third of 
patients had received no prior therapy. 
Overall, there were 6 objective responses (13%; 95% CI: 3%, 23%), including one complete response 
and five partial responses and 65% (95% CI: 51%, 79%) of patients were progression-free at 6 
months. Median PFS was 6.9 (95% CI: 6.5, 9.1) months and median OS was 12.4 (95% CI: 9.4, 19.9) 
months. 
• 
Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Advanced HCC *Boige et al., The Oncologist 2012; 17 
In the study conducted by Boige et al. 2012, 43 patients (22 (51.2%) 1L, 21 [48.8%] 2L) with 
histologically confirmed advanced HCC not amenable to curative-intent therapies (e.g., resection, liver 
transplantation, or percutaneous ablation) received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q2W until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients enrolled from May 2005 to December 2007 had 
ECOG PS ≤2 and compensated liver function (Child-Pugh A or B7) with no more than one prior 
systemic therapy. More than half of the patients had extrahepatic metastases, (91%) were classified 
as BCLC stage C. 
The primary objective of the study was to assess disease control rate at 16 weeks (16W-DCR) defined 
as the proportion of patients with a CR, PR, or SD at 16 weeks after study entry, as measured by the 
Investigator and reviewed by an independent radiologist according to RECIST v1.0. All tumor 
measurements were performed by the Investigator. At the end of the study, tumor measurements 
were reviewed by an independent radiologist who was blinded to the clinical and biological data. 
Among the 38 patients evaluable for radiologic response, 6 patients achieved a PR (ITT ORR, 14% 
[95% CI: 4%, 24%]) and the median DOR was 148 days (4.9 months, range 55-362 days). Eighteen 
patients had SD, including 12 patients who experienced SD for ≥ 16 weeks. The 16W-DCR was 42% 
(95% CI: 27%, 57%) in the overall population. The median PFS was 3 months (95% CI: 2, 4 months) 
and the median OS was 8 months (95% CI: 4, 9 months) after a median duration of follow-up of 27 
months. The 6- months PFS and OS rates were 33% (95% CI, 20%–47%) and 63% (95% CI, 48%–
76%), respectively. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided study IMbrave150, a Phase III, open-label, randomized Study of atezolizumab in 
combination with bevacizumab compared with sorafenib in Patients with untreated locally advanced or 
metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Study GO30140 provided supportive data in 1L HCC patients; Arm 
F used a randomized design to compare the combination treatment against atezolizumab monotherapy, 
whereas Arm A evaluated Atezo+Bev as single treatment option. 
This pivotal study is overall well-designed and well-conducted. No major concerns have been identified. 
The  study  design  has  previously  been  discussed  with  the  CHMP  and  endorsed  as  such 
(EMEA/H/SA/2522/16/2017/II). Sorafenib is SoC in this patient population. There is no atezo mono arm 
in this study in order to determine its contribution; however, based on available data from single arm 
studies and from the supportive study GO30140, it can be assumed that atezolizumab as monotherapy 
would not be superior to sorafenib. The use of bevacizumab has also previously been investigated in 1L 
and 2L HCC, showing limited efficacy (Siegel et al. 2008). However, the combination of atezolizumab 
and bevacizumab in the supportive study (Arm A) led to clinically encouraging results. These have now 
been confirmed in study IMbrave150. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 69/126 
 
 
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly define a patient population with locally advanced or 
metastatic and/or unresectable HCC not amenable to curative therapy, with no prior systemic 
treatments, Child-Pugh Class A, no other malignancies for the last 5 years, other types of liver cancer 
or co-infection with HBV/HCV. This is clearly reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its co-primary endpoint by showing statistically significant PFS gain, with a median PFS 
of 6.83 vs 4.27 months in atezo+bev and sorafenib arms respectively. The HR is 0.58, (0.47, 0.76), 
p<0.0001. These results are deemed clinically meaningful in this patients’ population with a dismal 
prognosis.   
The OS data from the 1st IA show a statistically significant HR of 0.58 (0.42, 0.79) with a p-value of 
0.0006. At the time of the 1st IA, the OS data were not mature yet with 161 deaths out of 312 deaths 
per the pre-specified OS analyses were observed. The MAH will submit updated overall survival (OS) 
data from the IMbrave150 study post-approval, providing 12 months of additional follow-up and the 
final OS data (after approximately 312 deaths have occurred (Recommendations)).  
The key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in 
favour of atezo+bev. ORR by IRF per RECIST 1.1 showed 27.3% vs 11.9%, ORR by IRF per HCC 
mRECIST showed 33.2% vs. 13.3%. DOR was also considerably longer in the atezo+bev arm.  
The effect of ADA on efficacy and safety has long been a concern. In the unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma study (IMbrave150), 27.9% of patients tested positive for ADAs at one or more post-dose 
time points. These patients generally had poorer health and disease characteristics at baseline 
compared to patients who only tested negative for ADA. The MAH has been requested to provide 
analyses of OS and PFS comparing ADA- and ADA+, adjusting for multiple baseline covariates to 
assess the effect of ADAs on efficacy; these exploratory analyses on OS showed that patients who 
were ADA-positive by week 6 (20.1%) appeared to have similar OS compared to sorafenib-treated 
patients, whereas ADA-negative patients by week 6 had an increased OS benefit compared to 
sorafenib-treated patients. These OS results were inconclusive due to the low number of events in ADA 
subgroups. Exploratory analyses on PFS suggested treatment benefit with atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab over sorafenib regardless of ADA status by week 6. It is not possible to draw any firm 
conclusion regarding the clinical relevance of the impact of ADA on efficacy given that ADA is a post-
randomization variable. 
Overall, subgroup analyses showed that results are consistent with the overall OS and PFS estimates.  
Available data suggest a small benefit of Atezo+Bev compared to sorafenib in the subgroup of patients 
with negative PD-L1 expression (applying a cutoff of <1%). Considering, that TC and IC expression of 
<1% was reported in nearly 40% of patients evaluable for PD-L1 expression (70/182) the lack of 
comprehensive PD-L1 –expression data is regarded as limitation of IMbrave 150. However, current 
data seem to indicate a treatment benefit in all-comers. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, study IMbrave150 met one of its co-primary endpoints, PFS, showing a statistically significant 
and clinically relevant difference in favour of atezo+bev, and thus considered a positive study. These 
results are supported by the 1st IA of OS and key secondary endpoints.

Table 57: Overview of adverse events of special interest for bevacizumab (safety-evaluable population) 
Diabetes mellitus occurred in 2.0% (10/493) of HCC patients who received atezolizumab in 
combination with bevacizumab. The median time to onset was 4.4 months (range: 1.2 months - 8.3 
months). No events of diabetes mellitus led to atezolizumab withdrawal.

Table 59: Adverse events leading to death (Safety-evaluable population) 
Treatment-Related Fatal Adverse Events 
In the SE population, 1 treatment-related Grade 5 AE occurred in the Sorafenib arm (hepatic cirrhosis) 
and  6  treatment-related  Grade  5  AEs  occurred  in  the  Atezo+Bev  arm.  In  the  Atezo+Bev  arm,  the 
treatment-related Grade 5 AEs were pneumonia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, liver injury, hepatic function 
abnormal, gastric ulcer perforation, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage; and each of them occurred in 1 
patient.  
Summaries of the treatment-related Grade 5 AEs reported in the both arms are provided below. 
Hepatic cirrhosis  
This 47-year-old male patient had hepatic cirrhosis, esophageal varices and splenomegaly. No confirmed 
signs  of  disease  progression  were noted  prior  to  the  event of  decompensated  liver  cirrhosis.  The last 
dose of sorafenib was administered on Study Day 132. On the same day, the patient experienced ascites 
and a general condition of swelling of the legs. Relevant laboratory work-up showed AST 55 U/L, ALT 27 
U/L, total 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 82/126 
 
 
 
 
bilirubin  28.2  mmol/  L,  and  albumin  29  g/l.  He  was  diagnosed  with  a  Grade  2  decompensated  liver 
cirrhosis.  The  patient  received  diuretic  therapy  and  correction  of  water  and  electrolyte  disorders. 
Sorafenib was discontinued due to the event of decompensated liver cirrhosis. The patient’s condition 
worsened  and  he  died  due  to  decompensated  liver  cirrhosis  on  Study  Day  223.  The  investigator 
considered this event as related to sorafenib and also as related to the concurrent condition of hepatic 
cirrhosis. 
Pneumonia 
This  71-year  old  male  patient  had  no  relevant  concurrent  condition  reported  and  received  the  most 
recent dose of atezolizumab and bevacizumab prior to the event on Study Day 225. Prior to event onset, 
no  confirmed  disease  progression  was  noticed.  The  patient  developed  severe  lung  infection  and  was 
admitted for septic shock on Study Day 231, which subsequently led to multi-organ impairment (kidney, 
heart,  lung).  The  CT  scan  showed  consolidation  in  the  lungs.  The  patient  died  due  to  pneumonia  on 
Study Day 240. The investigator considered the event as related to both atezolizumab and bevacizumab. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage  
This 88-year-old male patient had a medical history of hypertension that was controlled under treatment. 
He received the most recent dose of atezolizumab and bevacizumab prior to the event on Study Day 
126. The patient developed acute diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and was admitted to the intensive 
care unit on Study Day 147. The patient's blood pressure was 190/78 mm/Hg. CT head showed bilateral 
acute  subarachnoid  hemorrhage.  Carotid  duplex  showed  less  than  50%  stenosis  of  bilateral  internal 
carotid arteries and greater than 50% stenosis of the bilateral external carotid arteries. The patient died 
due to subarachnoid hemorrhage on Study Day 152. The event was assessed as related to bevacizumab 
and disease under study but not related to atezolizumab by the investigator. 
Liver injury 
This  61-year-old  male  patient  with  hepatic  cirrhosis  and  esophageal  and  gastric  varices  at  baseline 
received the most recent dose of atezolizumab and bevacizumab prior to the event on Study Day 85. 
Prior to event onset, no confirmed disease progression was noticed. On Study Day 94, a laboratory work-
up showed increased levels of total bilirubin of 9.35 mg/dl, ALT of 202 U/L, AST of 367 U/L, ALP of 298 
U/L and the patient was diagnosed with Grade 2 liver injury. Liver biopsy result revealed bilirubinostasis 
and  the  conventional  histological  picture  for  toxic  damage  under  the  mentioned  therapy.  Both 
atezolizumab  and  bevacizumab  were  interrupted  due  to  the  event.  The  event  did  not  improve  after 
treatment  with  steroids  and  immunosuppressive  agents  (mycophenolate  mofetil  and  tacrolimus).  The 
patient died due to liver injury on Study Day 121. The event of liver injury was considered as related to 
atezolizumab and disease under study but not related to bevacizumab by the investigator. 
Hepatic function abnormal 
This  74-year-old  male  patient  with  hepatic  fibrosis  at  baseline  received  the  most  recent  dose  of 
atezolizumab  and  bevacizumab  prior  to  event  on  Study  Day  22.  The  patient  discontinued  both  study 
treatments on Study Day 43 due to disease progression. On Study Day 73, a laboratory work-up showed 
increased levels of AST of 806 U/L and ALT of 735 U/L. He developed Grade 4 hepatic function abnormal 
on Study Day 77, which was assessed as related to atezolizumab, and started treatment with steroids. 
On Study Day 86, a CT scan revealed hepatic atrophy which suggested that the patient developed liver 
failure and plasma exchange was started. The event did not improve and the patient died due to hepatic 
function abnormal on Study Day 90. The autopsy result revealed remarkable liver atrophy. There was 
also  a  necrosis  of  the  ascending  and  transverse  colon  due  to  the  direct  invasion  by  HCC.  The  AE  of 
hepatic function abnormal was assessed as related to atezolizumab, disease under study, and concurrent 
illness but not related to bevacizumab by the investigator.  
Gastric ulcer perforation 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 83/126 
 
 
 
This 76-year-old male patient had concurrent condition of duodenal ulcer and received the most recent 
dose  of  atezolizumab  and  bevacizumab  prior  to  the  event  on  Study  Day  43.  Prior  to  event  onset  no 
confirmed disease progression was noticed. On Study Day 64, a gastric penetration was identified on 
computer  tomography  (CT).  The  upper  gastrointestinal  series  revealed  no  leakage  of  the  contrast 
medium from the stomach. Gastroscopy revealed an ulcer on the stomach’s anterior wall. The patient’s 
Hemoglobin 
was 6.4 g/dl and he received blood transfusion, omeprazole, and paracetamol for the event. The patient 
developed  a  gastric  perforation  despite  treatment.  Atezolizumab  and  bevacizumab  were  both 
discontinued due to gastric ulcer perforation. The patient developed peritonitis on Study Day 87. He died 
on Study Day 190 from deterioration of his nutritional condition due to the gastric ulcer perforation. The 
event of gastric ulcer perforation was assessed as related to bevacizumab by the investigator. 
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage  
This 58-year-old male patient was positive for macro-vascular invasion with portal vein tumor thrombosis 
in the first-order branches of the portal vein (VP3) and had hepatic cirrhosis at baseline. He received the 
most  recent  dose  of  atezolizumab  and  bevacizumab  prior  to  the  event  on  Study  Day  44.  The  patient 
vomited blood at home on Study Day 62 and died at home on the next day. His last tumor assessment 
indicated stable disease. The Grade 5 AE of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was assessed as related to both 
atezolizumab and bevacizumab and also related to disease under study by the investigator.

Hy’s Law Analysis 
Potential Hy’s law cases were defined in the study protocol as ALT or AST increases above 3xfold the 
baseline with concomitant total bilirubin increases above 2xfold the ULN within 7 days. 
Following  detailed  review,  24  of  the  26  potential  Hy’s  law  cases  (13  in  the  Sorafenib  and  11  in  the 
Atezo+Bev arm) did not qualify as true Hy’s law cases due to the following reasons: 
• 
• 
Patients had liver function test abnormalities in the context of investigator-assessed progressive 
disease (9 cases in the Sorafenib arm and 6 cases in the Atezo+Bev arm) 
The liver function abnormalities could be attributed to alternate etiologies, including cholangitis 
or disease under study (4 cases in the Sorafenib arm and 5 cases in the Atezo+Bev arm). 
The 2 remaining potential Hy’s law cases (1 patient in each treatment arm) were classified as true Hy’s 
law cases due to the lack of alternate etiology. The patient in the Sorafenib arm experienced Grade 3 
blood bilirubin increased on Study Day 22. Sorafenib was interrupted due to the event and the Grade 3 
blood bilirubin increased resolved on Study Day 29. On Study Day 50, the patient experienced elevated 
liver function tests in the Hy’s law range with a corresponding Grade 4 liver function test increased and 
Grade 3 blood bilirubin increased. Sorafenib was permanently discontinued due to these events and the

event resolved on Study Day 78. The event was assessed as related to Sorafenib. Due to the lack of 
alternate etiology and the positive re-challenge, this case met the criteria for Hy’s law. 
The patient in the Atezo+Bev arm experienced Grade 4 hepatobiliary disease on Study Day 9 prior to 
elevated liver function tests in the Hy’s law range on Study Day 36. The event led to both atezolizumab 
and bevacizumab discontinuation. The patient received mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone 
for  the  event.  Hepatobiliary  disease  resolved.  The  event  was  assessed  as  related  to  both  study 
treatments. 
Table 65: Summary for potential Hy’s law analysis (safety-evaluable population) 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors: age, safety in elderly 
Overall, the safety profile of Atezo+Bev was generally comparable across all age groups. 
The majority of patients across all age groups reported at least one AE. The distribution of AE 
categories was comparable between the < 65 years and ≥ 65 years age subgroups). 
The smaller sample size for the subgroups of 75-84 years (n = 66) and ≥ 85 years (n = 7) limits 
meaningful conclusions in these two subgroups. 
While there were some numerical differences in certain atezolizumab AESI categories between patients 
aged < 65 years (n = 277) and ≥ 65 years (n = 216), the overall atezolizumab AESI profiles were also 
similar between the two groups.

Table 68: Overview AESI for Atezo by Atezolizumab, by Age Categories (Years) 
Intrinsic factor: sex 
Consistent with the disease demographics for HCC, the majority of patients were men (82.8%). The 
overall safety profile of Atezo+Bev was comparable between men and women with the following 
exceptions: a numerically higher percentage of men experienced Grade 5 AEs (5.1% vs 1.2%) and 
treatment-related Grade 5 AEs (2.2% vs. 0). Due to the relatively smaller number of female patients 
compared with the male patients, these differences should be interpreted with caution.

Intrinsic factor: Race 
Overall, the highest frequency in AE grade 3-4 were reported Hypertension, AST increased, Proteinuria 
blood bilirubin increased, platelet count decreased, ALT increased and Hyponatraemia in all subgroups. 
However, the majority of patients in the Atezo+Bev population were Asians (62.1%), with Whites 
accounting for 31.0%. Given the relatively small sample sizes in “Black” (n=13) and “Other” (n=21) 
subgroups, the safety analyses by race is presented for the Asian and White subgroups only. 
While there was a numerical increase in incidence of events in AE categories in White patients when 
compared to Asian patients, these increases were not driven by any specific SOC or PT.

Subgroup Analyses of Safety by Anti-Drug Antibody Status 
The impact of atezolizumab ADA status on safety was evaluated. No analysis was done for the impact 
of bevacizumab ADA status on safety due to the very low bevacizumab ADA positive rate in general. 
Pooled Analysis IMbrave150 and GO31040  
Among ADA-evaluable patients, atezolizumab ADA-negative and ADA-positive patients received a 
median number of 11.0 and 10.0 cycles of atezolizumab, respectively. 
An overview of safety by ADA status is shown in Table 1. Numerical differences were observed in 
treatment related (Atezo-related) AEs specially Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs AEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of treatment. Several PTs in the All AEs output showed a difference in frequency of 
more than 5% in the ADA-positive group, but no specific pattern was identified and the majority of the 
events were commonly reported events in cancer patients. No significant differences were observed in 
potentially immune related AEs, and no significant difference between groups was seen among SAEs. 
The incidence of AESIs of any grade by ADA status was comparable (60.8% ADA-negative vs. 61.5% 
ADA-positive).

Table 79: Overview of Adverse Events by atezolizumab ADA status 
The incidences of AEs are shown in Table 5.5.1.8.13 for terms where a ≥5% difference was seen 
between the two ADA subgroups. There were numerical differences by ADA status with most 
incidences higher in ADA-positive patients. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 101/126 
 
 
 
 
Table 80: Adverse Events by ADA status with 5% difference between ADA subgroups 
The incidence of Grade 1-2 events was higher in the ADA-negative compared with the ADA-positive 
subgroup (44.1% vs. 32.1%) whereas Grade 3-4 AEs (50.0% vs. 59.0%) and Grade 5 AEs (3.2% vs. 
6.7%) occurred at a higher incidence in the ADA-positive subgroup. 
The most common SOCs in which Grade 3-4 AEs were reported with a differential ≥5% between ADA-
negative and ADA-positive patients included: 
• 
Investigations (15.0% vs. 23.9%), most common AEs were increased AST (5.3% vs. 6.7%), 
increased ALT (3.2% vs. 3.0%), increased bilirubin (2.9% vs. 3.7%), increased platelets 
(2.4% vs. 6%) and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (0% vs. 4.9%). 
•  Hepatobiliary Disorders (4.4% vs. 9.7%), most common AE was cholangitis (1.2% vs. 3.1%). 
Other commonly reported Grade 3-4 AEs included proteinuria (ADA-negative: 4.1%; ADA-positive: 
3.7%), anemia (ADA-negative: 2.1%; ADA-positive: 3.7%) and IRRs (ADA-negative: 0.9%; ADA-
positive: 3.0%). 
The most common SOCs in which Grade 5 AEs were reported included Gastrointestinal Disorders (ADA-
negative subgroup: 2 patients, 0.6%; ADA-positive subgroup: 4 patients, 3.0%) and Infections and 
Infestations (ADA-negative subgroup: 5 patients, 1.5%; ADA-positive subgroup: 0 patients). 
The most frequent Grade 5 AE was pneumonia (PT) among ADA-negative patients (2 patients, 0.6%) 
and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (PT) among ADA-positive patients (3 patients, 2.2%).

Table 81: Grade 5 Events by ADA Status 
The incidence of AEs reported as serious was higher in the ADA-positive subgroup (50.0%) compared 
with the ADA-negative subgroup (31.5%). The most common serious AEs by preferred term are shown 
in Table 92. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the only SAE with a ≥ 2% difference between ADA-
negative and -positive patients (0.9% vs. 4.5%). All other serious AEs were reported at a low 
incidence.

Table 82: Common (≥1% in any Arm) Serious Adverse Events by ADA Status (ADA Evaluable Population) 
The incidence of AESIs was generally comparable across the majority of safety categories with the 
exception of Grade 3-4 AESIs (19.1% ADA-negative vs. 30.6% ADA-positive) (Table 5.5.1.8.16). The 
difference in Grade 3-4 AESIs was mainly driven by more events of hepatitis laboratory abnormalities 
in the ADA-positive subgroup. 
By medical concept, the most common (≥10% in either ADA-negative or ADA-positive) AESIs were 
hepatitis (diagnosis and laboratory abnormalities), rash, hypothyroidism and IRR. The frequency of 
most AESIs was similar between the ADA subgroups except for hepatitis laboratory abnormalities 
(32.1% ADA-negative vs. 37.3% ADA-positive) and IRRs (6.5% vs. 14.9%). 
•  Hepatitis laboratory abnormalities were mainly of Grade 1-2 severity in the ADA-negative 
group (Grade 1-2: 20.0% vs. Grade 3-4: 11.8%) whereas in the ADA-positive group, Grade 3-
4 events were more common (Grade 3-4: 20.2% vs. Grade 1-2: 16.4%). 
• 
IRRs were mainly Grade 1-2 in both ADA subgroups (ADA-negative: 5.5% vs. ADA-positive: 
12.0%) and the overall incidence of Grade 3 IRRs was low (ADA-negative: 0.9% vs. ADA-
positive: 3.0%). There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 IRRs. There were no events of 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis in the ADA-positive subgroup; 
There was one case of Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome in this subgroup.

study treatment (Safety-evaluable population) 
AEs leading to dose modification/interruption 
AEs that led to dose reduction were reported in 37.2% of patients in the Sorafenib arm. Dose 
reductions for any reason were not permitted in the Atezo+Bev arm. A numerically lower proportion of 
patients in the Sorafenib arm (41.0%) experienced AEs that led to dose interruption compared to the 
Atezo + Bev arm (49.5%). The most common AEs (> 2% of patients) leading to dose 
reduction/interruption of sorafenib in the Sorafenib arm were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (17.3%), diarrhea (10.9%), blood bilirubin increased (5.1%), fatigue (4.5%), decreased 
appetite (4.5%), hypertension (3.8%), platelet count decreased (3.2%), pyrexia (3.2%), vomiting 
(3.2%), rash (3.2%), aspartate aminotransferase increased 
(3.2%), ascites (2.6%), nausea (2.6%), abdominal pain (2.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(2.6%), and asthenia (2.6%). The most common AEs (> 2% of patients) leading to dose interruption 
of any treatment in the Atezo+Bev arm were proteinuria (6.7%), hypertension (6.1%), aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (5.2%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3.3%), hyperthyroidism 
(2.7%), platelet count decreased (2.4%), and pyrexia (2.4%).  
Post marketing experience 
Since the International Birth Date (18 May 2016) through 17 May 2019, an estimated cumulative total 
of 46,699 patients have received atezolizumab from marketing experience (US n=29,044; EU n=8,253; 
Japan n=3,796; Rest of the World n=5,605). No new or unexpected safety findings were identified in 
the post-marketing setting for atezolizumab used as a monotherapy or in the approved combination 
therapies.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The analysis of safety is based on the findings in the pivotal study IMbrave150, where a sufficient number 
of patients have been exposed to atezo+bev for a sufficient period of time. The safety database should 
allow a thorough assessment of the safety profile of atezo+bev. 
Overall, the observed AEs reflect the known safety profile of sorafenib, atezo and bev. These AEs are 
well-known  by  clinicians,  and  the  majority  of  them  are  manageable  in  the  clinically  setting  with 
supportive therapy, etc. 
The  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  and  Grade  5  AEs  is  similar  between  the  two  treatment  arms.  Looking  at 
Grade 3-4, higher incidences in atezo+bev arm are seen in terms of ALT increase, decreased platelet 
count, hypertension, proteinuria and IRR. There were more deaths in the sorafenib arm, both due to AEs 
and disease progression. In the sorafenib arm, 9 (5.8%) patients died due to AEs compared to 15 (4.6%) 
patients in the atezo+bev arm. Six patients in the atezo+bev arm died due to fatal bleedings, and 3 of 
them were deemed related to bevacizumab by the investigators. Precautionary measures are reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
A higher incidence of SAEs is observed in the atezo+bev arm, and the main differences are seen in terms 
of gastrointestinal disorder, including bleedings (14.9% vs. 11.5%) and infections (7.3% vs 1.9%).  
A higher incidence of fatal infections is seen in the atezo+bev arm. Although “infections” is reflected in 
section 4.8, and “sepsis” is mentioned in footnote “e”, the MAH was requested to clearly reflect the risk 
of sepsis in table 2 of section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
HCC  patients  are  at  higher  risk  of  esophageal/gastric  varices  due  to  the  underlying  disease.  Despite 
attempts to exclude all patients with prior bleeding due to esophageal and/or gastric varices within 6 
months  prior  to  study  treatment,  and  perform  esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD)  on  all  patients  in 
order to treat all size varices, a considerable number of patients experienced gastrointestinal bleedings 
in the atezo+bev arm.  
Dose modifications were not allowed in the atezo+bev arm. Overall, a higher incidence of discontinuation 
was observed in the atezo+bev arm, 15.6% vs. 10.3%. approximately 1/3 of discontinuations were due 
to  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  Bevacizumab  was  discontinued  due  to  AEs  much  more  often  than  atezo, 
14.6% vs 8.5%. This clearly reflects that bevacizumab is less well tolerated than atezo.  
A higher number of patients needed a dose interruption in the atezo+bev arm, and the most common 
AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  were  proteinuria  (6.7%),  hypertension  (6.1%),  ALT/AST  increase 
(5.2%), hyperthyroidism (2.7%), thrombocytopenia (2.4%) and pyrexia (2.4%). Again, it is clearly seen 
that the majority of dose interruptions were due to AEs related to the use of bevacizumab. 
Finally, the MAH provided an analysis of safety depending on the ADA status. ADA+ patients overall 
experience more AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, Grade 5 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
treatment or dose interruption. Looking at Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs, patients with ADA+ status 
experienced more gastrointestinal bleedings and liver toxicity.  
Data in HCC patients with Child-Pugh B liver disease treated with atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab are very limited and there are currently no data available in HCC patients with Child-Pugh 
C liver disease.  
Patients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, and cases of severe 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including fatal events, were reported in patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) treated with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. In patients with HCC, 
screening for and subsequent treatment of oesophageal varices should be performed as per clinical 
practice prior to starting treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 109/126 
 
 
 
Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding 
with the combination treatment. 
Diabetes mellitus can occur during treatment with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. 
Physicians should monitor blood glucose levels prior to and periodically during treatment with 
atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as clinically indicated (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The incidence of Grade 3-4 and Grade 5 AEs is similar between the atezo+bev and sorafenib arms. 
Despite attempts to exclude all patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding from the study higher 
incidences of bleeding, including fatal bleedings, infections, discontinuations and dose interruptions 
due to AEs were seen in the atezo+bev arm. The use of bevacizumab in patients with HCC is 
challenging, because many of these patients have a higher risk of bleeding due to their underlying 
disease and adequate information has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to the very limited data in HCC patients with 
Child-Pugh B liver disease and the absence of data in HCC patients with Child-Pugh C liver disease. A 
new warning has also been included to reflect patients excluded from the clinical trials in HCC. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. In particular, 
key  safety  messages  are  not  affected  by  this  extension.  The  new  additions  follow  the  same 
structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet. 
• 
The posology proposed in this application is the same as for the currently approved indications. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It occurs in patients 
with  chronic  liver  inflammation  due  to  HBV,  HCV,  excessive  alcohol  intake  or  other  toxins  such  as 
aflatoxin.  Furthermore,  haemochromatosis,  alpha  1-antitrypsin  deficiency,  metabolic  syndrome  and 
NASH increase the risk of HCC. 
The Applicant seeks approval for:  
“Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy (see 
section 5.1).” 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 121/126 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Sorafenib remains the global standard of care for treatment of patients with unresectable HCC based on 
two  multicenter,  randomized,  double−blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase III  trials:  the  SHARP  trial  in 
Western  regions  and  a  trial  conducted  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  (Asia-Pacific  Trial).  Both  studies 
demonstrated a survival benefit of sorafenib vs. placebo. Sorafenib is often poorly tolerated, and dose 
reductions or drug discontinuations due to AEs are common (Nexavar EPAR).   
Recently, treatment with lenvatinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was shown to be 
non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint of OS (lenvatinib vs. sorafenib: median 
OS 13.6 months vs. 12.3 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79, 1.06; 
non-inferiority  margin = 1.08)  though  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  OS  was  not  observed 
(REFLECT) (Lenvima II/11/G EPAR). 
Despite available treatment options, there is a still a high unmet need for effective treatment options in 
these patients, who have a dismal prognosis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH has provided Study IMbrave150, a phase III, open-label, randomized study of atezolizumab 
in combination with bevacizumab compared with sorafenib in patients with untreated locally advanced 
or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its co-primary endpoint by showing statistically significant PFS gain, with a median PFS 
of  6.83  vs  4.27  months  in  atezo+bev  and  sorafenib  arms  respectively.  The  HR  is  0.59  (0.47,  0.76), 
p<0.0001.  
The OS data from the 1st IA show a statistically significant HR of 0.58 (0.42, 0.79) with a p-value of 
0.0006.  
The  key  secondary  endpoints  showed  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  differences  in 
favour  of  atezo+bev.  ORR  by  IRF  per  RECIST  1.1  showed  27.3%  vs  11.9%,  ORR  by  IRF  per  HCC 
mRECIST showed 33.2% vs. 13.3%. DOR was also considerably longer in the atezo+bev arm.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS and DOR data are not mature yet. More mature data will be provided post approval 
(recommendation). 
There seems to be a trend showing a negative impact of ADA on OS and PFS, however data should be 
interpreted with caution, because of differences in baseline disease characteristics between ADA- and 
ADA+ patients and immature OS data in the ADA subgroups. The MAH provided analyses of OS and 
PFS comparing ADA- and ADA+, adjusting for multiple baseline covariates that indicated similar OS 
results between the ADA+ population and sorafenib, whereas an OS benefit was shown for the ADA- 
subgroup compared to sorafenib. It is not possible to draw any firm conclusion regarding the clinical 
relevance of the impact of ADA on efficacy given that ADA is a post-randomization variable. 
Although no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the exploratory PD-L1 expression analyses of 
available samples in only 40% of the study population, efficacy outcomes appear to be associated with 
PD-L1 expression status, with a larger benefit for the PD-L1 positive subgroup (PD-L1 TC/IC≥ 1%). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/584169/2020  
Page 122/126 
 
 
 
However, available data suggest a small overall survival benefit for Atezo + Bev compared to Sorafenib 
also in the PD-L1 negative subgroup without detrimental effects with regard to PFS or response status. 
Efficacy data by PD-L1 expression status should be provided with updated OS data post approval. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Higher incidences of Grade 3-4 AEs are seen in the atezo+bev arm in terms of ALT increase, decreased 
platelet count, hypertension, proteinuria and IRR.  
Six patients in the atezo+bev arm died due to fatal bleedings. Furthermore, a higher incidence of fatal 
infections is seen in the atezo+bev arm.  
A higher incidence of SAEs is observed in the atezo+bev arm, and the main differences are seen in terms 
of gastrointestinal disorder, including bleedings (14.9% vs. 11.5%) and infections (7.3% vs 1.9%).  
Dose modifications were not allowed in the atezo+bev arm. Overall, a higher incidence of discontinuation 
was observed in the atezo+bev arm, 15.6% vs. 10.3%. approximately 1/3 of discontinuations were due 
to  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  Bevacizumab  was  discontinued  due  to  AEs  much  more  often  than  atezo, 
14.6% vs 8.5%.  
A higher number of patients needed a dose interruption in the atezo+bev arm, and the most common 
AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  were  proteinuria  (6.7%),  hypertension  (6.1%),  ALT/AST  increase 
(5.2%), hyperthyroidism (2.7%), thrombocytopenia (2.4%) and pyrexia (2.4%).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
An analysis of safety as function of ADA status seems to show that ADA+ patients overall experience 
more AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, Grade 5 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or dose 
interruption.  Looking  at  Grade  3-4  AEs  and  SAEs,  patients  with  ADA+  status  experienced  more 
gastrointestinal bleedings and liver toxicity.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with HCC have a dismal prognosis with a relatively short median OS, as seen in the control 
arm. Thus, there is a high unmet need for new effective treatment options that can prolong OS in 
these patients. Atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab seems to prolong both PFS and OS. 
These findings are further supported by an increase in ORR and DOR. 
Efficacy results appear to be associated with PD-L1 expression status based on exploratory analysis in 
only 40% of the study population. Available data suggest a small overall survival benefit for Atezo + 
Bev compared to Sorafenib also in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. Considering also the safety profiles of 
both treatment arms and the fact that biopsies are often not part of the routine clinical management, a 
favourable benefit-risk assessment is accepted in an all-comer population. 
Atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab gives rise to considerably more bleeding episodes, 
including fatal bleeding, compared to sorafenib. Despite attempts to exclude all patients at risk for 
gastrointestinal bleeding from the study, a higher incidence of bleeding, including fatal bleeding, 
infections, discontinuations and dose interruptions due to AEs were seen in the atezo+bev arm. Overall 
the incidence of Grade 3-4 and Grade 5 AEs is similar between the two treatment arms. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated benefit in the overall study population is considered clinically relevant and there are 
no major safety concerns apart from a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is clearly reflected 
in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also reflected.  The benefits of atezolizumab in 
combination with bevacizumab outweigh the safety concerns in the target population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Raising ADA development as a concern is difficult since developing ADAs is a risk and cannot be 
determined a priori.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include, in combination with with bevacizumab, the treatment of patients 
with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy, 
based on the results of the pivotal study YO40245 (IMbrave150) as well as data from Arms A and F of 
the supportive Phase Ib study GO30140. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the Tecentriq 1200mg concentrate for solution for infusion SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1.  
An updated RMP version 13.1 was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above. 
Summary 
Please refer to Scientific Discussion Tecentriq EMEA/H/C/004143/II/0039.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 06 October 2020. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-
agencies/european-medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-
confidential-information_en.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after 
the Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP 
Opinion, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will 
be adopted within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted 
within 30 days after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised 
Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
The MAH is reminded that, at the same time as the submission on the eCTD closing sequence 
mentioned above, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP 
agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
4. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the 
MAH is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar 
days of the receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free 
of metadata, headers and footers.

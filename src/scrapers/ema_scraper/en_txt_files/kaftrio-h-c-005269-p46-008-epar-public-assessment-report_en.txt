1.  Introduction 
On 9-2-2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cystic Fibrosis Subjects 6 Through 
11 Years of Age Who Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function Mutation 
(F/MF), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Kaftrio is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kaftrio obtained initially a marketing authorization 
in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with 
a minimal function (MF) mutation in 2020. In 2021, the indication was extended to patients aged 12 
years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recently, the indication was extended to children with CF aged 6 
years through 11.  
Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors and facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, leading to an increase in the amount of CFTR protein, while ivacaftor increases channel 
gating of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor results in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR chloride transport 
The MAH stated that Study VX19-445-116, a Phase 3b, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects 6 
Through 11 Years of Age Who Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function 
Mutation (F/MF) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Description 
Methods 
Study 116 was a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter 
study in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/MF genotypes.

Figure 1 Study 116 Study Design 
CHMP comment 
The duration of treatment was approximately 24 weeks. This is adequate to observe an effect on 
pulmonary function and sweat chloride.  
Study participants 
Table 1 Key Eligibility Criteria in Study 116 
Other exclusion criteria were: 
•  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
o  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL

o  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
o  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥3 × ULN 
o  Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation) 
CHMP comment  
The inclusion criterion of ppFEV1 ≥70% is much higher than in other trials of the inclusion criterion of 
ppFEV1 ≥40%. This may have indicated that a less severe population could have been included. 
However, the inclusion of patients with LCI2.5 ≥ 7.5 indicates that the small airways had to be 
impaired. Although the limitation to patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 70% is not fully understood, the in-and 
exclusion criteria are accepted.   
Treatments 
The dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA evaluated is 200 mg qd/100 mg qd/150 mg every q12h 
Table 1 Treatment Period Groups and Dosages 
CHMP comment 
The used dosing is identical to authorised dosing for this age group using identical weight classes.  
Objective(s) 
The Primary Objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
with CF with F/MF genotypes.  
The Secondary Objectives are to evaluate the PD of ELX/TEZ/IVA and the safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24. 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Absolute change in sweat chloride (SwCl) from baseline through Week 24 
•  Safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, 
standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, pulse oximetry and ophthalmologic 
examinations (OEs)

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/627111/2022  
Page 8/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Endpoints 
•  Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) from 
baseline through Week 24 
•  Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain (RD) 
score from baseline through Week 24 
CHMP comment 
The endpoint are agreed, as they measure relevant aspects and goals for a treatment in CF. LCI2.5 is a 
sensitive measurement for impairment in smaller airways, the part that is affected in the beginning of 
CF.  
Sample size 
Approximately 108 subjects were planned to be randomized (54 subjects in each treatment group).  
The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline 
through Week 24 is the same for the 2 treatment groups, ELX/TEZ/IVA and placebo. The null 
hypothesis will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.  
Assuming a within-group SD of 1.5 and a treatment difference of -1.0 between ELX/TEZ/IVA and 
placebo, a sample size of 49 subjects completing the Treatment Period in each group for a total of 98 
subjects will have approximately 90% power for the LCI2.5 hypothesis testing, based on a 2-sided 2-
sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 108 
subjects will be enrolled. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Approximately 108 subjects are planned to be randomized (1:1) to the ELX/TEZ/IVA group or the 
placebo group. Randomization will be stratified by LCI2.5 determined at the Screening Visit (<10 
versus ≥10) and weight at the Screening Visit (<30 kg versus ≥30 kg). 
Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and may 
occur on either Day 1 or Day -1. 
The study was performed blinded.

Table 2 describes all efficacy and PD analyses based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), with subjects 
grouped by their randomized treatment. Each continuous efficacy and PD endpoint was analysed using 
a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment group, visit, and treatment-
by-visit interaction as fixed effects. Baseline LCI2.5 and weight at Screening (<30 versus ≥30 kg) were 
included in the model as covariates unless otherwise noted. In addition, descriptive summaries are 
provided for each efficacy and PD endpoint.

Table 3 Subject Disposition (All Subjects Set) 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 34 sites in Australia, Canada, Israel, Switzerland, UK, and the 
European Union (specifically, in Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain).  
Study initiation: 19 June 2020 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form)  
Study completion: 17 May 2021 (date last subject completed the last visit)  
Conduct 
There were no changes in conduct of the global study protocol and SAP 
Safety measures were implemented to provide subjects the opportunity to continue participation in this 
study while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure through travel. Remote 
monitoring visits, including remote source data verification, were permitted as allowed per local 
regulations. 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) was defined as any protocol deviation that may have 
significantly affected the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may have 
significantly affected a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. 
A total of 2 (1.7%) subjects had IPDs; for both subjects, the correct version of the ICF was not signed 
by subjects’ parents.

However, these baseline values LCI2.5 < 7.5 and/or ppFEV1< 70% were post-screening values. 
Therefore, the subjects were still considered to have met eligibility criteria.

Efficacy results LCI2.5 
Primary endpoint  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24 weeks in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/MF 
genotypes resulted in a statistically significant, improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint.   
The LS mean treatment difference for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change 
in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -2.26 (95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P<0.0001). 
The analysis of absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 is presented in Table 8 and 
Figure 2.

Figure 2 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change From Baseline in LCI2.5 by Visit (FAS) 
CHMP comments  
The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 was measured from baseline through Week 24. However, the 
use of absolute change from baseline at week 24, would have been preferred.  
The additional analysis of the absolute change in LCI2.5 at Day 15 showed that the results are 
consistent with the primary analysis of absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 (LS 
mean treatment difference of -2.26 [95% CI: -2.71, -1.81] for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus 
placebo). In table 14.2.1.6.5 also the change from baseline at week 24 were provided: -2.76 (-3.36, -
2.16). Based on this information, it is considered the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline at Week 
24 is also consistent (or a slightly better) than absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 
24 (Figure 2).  
The robustness of the data was confirmed by sensitivity analyses that account for the missing data.  
Secondary endpoints 
Results for absolute change from baseline through Week 24 for all efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
• 
The LS mean treatment difference for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo for the absolute 
change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; 
nominal P<0.0001).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/627111/2022  
Page 19/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The LS mean treatment difference for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo for the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 11.0 percentage points (95% CI: 6.9, 
15.1; nominal P<0.0001). 
• 
The LS mean treatment difference for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo for the absolute 
change in CFQ-R RD score from baseline through Week 24 was 5.5 points (95% CI: 1.0, 10.0; 
nominal P = 0.0174). 
CHMP comments 
For LCI2.5, sweat chloride, CFQ-R, ppFEV1, missing data patterns over the full follow up period were 
provided. These missing data was mostly at week 24 (e.g. for LCI2.5 8.2% missing in placebo vs 
16.7% in Kaftrio). Most common reason was ‘not meeting criteria’, and only in very few cases due AE, 
non-compliance, death, physician decision, or subject refusal or prohibited medication. Therefore, 
missing data can be considered not related to underlying outcome as the applicant explained that ‘not 
meeting criteria’ was not related to the underlying outcome. For LCI2.5, the primary endpoint, a jump-
to-reference missing data imputation was performed as sensitivity analysis. The estimate (95%-CI) 
was -2.32 ( -2.76, -1.88) for the jump-to-reference imputation compared to 2.26 (-2.71, -1.81) in the 
primary analysis. Thus, efficacy results are considered robust. 
Safety results 
Exposure  
A total of 121 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The mean 
exposure was 23.7 weeks in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 24.0 weeks in the placebo group.

Adverse events  
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 80.0% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 93.4% in the 
placebo group. The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity; 2 (3.3%) 
subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (3.3%) subjects in the placebo group had severe AEs. 
Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 4 (6.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 9 (14.8%) subjects in 
the placebo group. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 1 (1.7%) subject discontinued study drug due to an AE 
and 7 (11.7%) subjects interrupted study drug due to AEs. No subjects in the placebo group 
discontinued or interrupted study drug. There were no life-threatening AEs and no deaths.  
Table 10 Overview of Adverse Events (Safety Set) 
Common adverse events  
AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects in any treatment group are summarized by PT in Table 11.  
Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF disease in 
CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age or with the established safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.3%) subjects had severe AEs (both subjects had AEs of rash) and no 
subjects had life-threatening AEs. In the placebo group, 2 (3.3%) subjects had severe AEs (1 subject 
had an AE of nasal polyps and 1 subject had AEs of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome) and no 
subjects had life-threatening AEs. 
Relationship of Adverse Events 
Two (3.3%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (3.3%) subjects in the placebo group had an AE

Study drug discontinuation  
One (1.7%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had an AE of rash that led to study drug 
discontinuation. The event was assessed as severe and possibly related to study drug. Study drug was 
withdrawn, and the event resolved. No subjects in the placebo group discontinued study drug. 
Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
Seven (11.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group interrupted study drug due to an AE. AEs that led to 
treatment interruption that occurred in ≥2 subjects were ALT increased and AST increased. No 
subjects in the placebo group had AEs that led to treatment interruption.

Table 15 Summary of Elevated Transaminase Events (Safety Set) 
Eight (13.3%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (4.9%) subjects in the placebo group had a 
least 1 rash event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity. One (1.7 %) subject in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had a rash event that led to treatment discontinuation. Two (3.3%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group interrupted study drug due to rash events; both subjects successfully resumed 
study drug without recurrence of rash. No subjects in the placebo group had rash events that led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
There were no trends in mean values of other non-LFT chemistry parameters.  
Mean concentrations of LFT parameters were variable over time in both treatment groups. There were 
no trends in ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT for either group. 
ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 8 (13.6%), 3 (5.1%), and 1 (1.7%) subject(s) in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group, compared to 3 (4.9%), 1 (1.6%), and 0 subject(s) in the placebo group. No 
subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the EU, Kaftrio is approved as a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients 
with CF in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  
Design and conduct  
Study VX19-445-116 is a Phase 3b, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy and 
Safety of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age Who 
Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function Mutation (F/MF).  
The investigated dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA is identical with the dose authorized for the age group and 
weight classes.

Male and female CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/MF genotypes were included with 
screening FEV1 ≥70% and LCI2.5 ≥7.5. The inclusion criterion of ppFEV1 ≥ 70% may have indicated 
that a less severe population could have been included. However, the inclusion of patients with LCI2.5 
≥ 7.5 indicates that the small airways had to be impaired. Although the limitation to patients with 
ppFEV1 ≥ 70% is not fully understood, the in-and exclusion criteria are accepted.   
For efficacy evaluation, Multiple-breath washout, spirometry, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 
(CFQ-R), and sweat chloride (SwCl) were assessed. These are all relevant parameters. The LCI2.5 can 
measure changes in the small airways, while the ppFEV1 is more associated with large airways. In CF,   
the small airways are earlier affected than the large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a 
measurement of efficacy is acceptable, given the usually well-preserved lung function in children. 
However, the LCI2.5 at week 24 would have been preferred instead of through week 24. Evaluation of 
BMI-z-score would also have been appreciated. Nevertheless, the chosen endpoints are sufficient. 
Safety parameters were the usual measurements.  
All efficacy and PD analyses based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Each continuous efficacy and PD 
endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) including 
treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects. Baseline LCI2.5 and weight 
at Screening (<30 versus ≥30 kg) were included in the model as covariates unless otherwise noted. 
Statistics were considered adequate.  
Demographics and patient characteristics  
A total of 52 distinct F/MF genotypes were represented. More female (57.9% were included compared 
with male (42.1%). The demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced. The 
mean (SD) weight at baseline was 29.4 (8.1) kg, and the mean (SD) weight z-score at baseline was -
0.28 (0.97), indicating that baseline weights were below average for subjects’ age and sex. The mean 
(SD) baseline BMI z-score was -0.28 (0.89) and mean (SD) baseline height z-score was -0.08 (1.14).  
Mean (SD) baseline LCI2.5 was 10.01 (2.09) indicating that the small airways were already affected. 
Mean baseline ppFEV1 was 89.3% indicating that FEV1 was still well preserved, but the range (44.6-
121.8%) indicated that subjects could already have impaired FEV1. A total of 14 subjects had baseline 
ppFEV1 < 70%, thus lower than the inclusion criterion of ppFEV1 ≥ 70%. This could be explained that 
these baseline values LCI2.5 < 7.5 and/or of ppFEV1< 70% were post-screening values. Although it is 
acknowledged that there are usually some differences between screening and baseline values, the 
number of patients that were eligible but had lower values at baseline is considered rather high, 
Nevertheless, it is agreed that the subjects were eligible. 
Results  
The LS mean treatment difference for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change 
in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -2.26 (95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P<0.0001). The minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is not known. Therefore, an effect larger than the 
natural variability might be regarded as clinically relevant. The natural variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 0.9 
unit or 15 % of baseline1. Based on these recommendation and previously accepted margin of 1 unit, 
the study can be considered to have met the primary objective. Additional results at D15 and at Week 
24 were consistent with the results of absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24.  
As for the secondary endpoints, all endpoints showed a statistically significant difference for the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo. The results of all secondary endpoints can be considered 
supportive for the primary analyses as they also met the clinically relevant changes.

Sweat chloride is a biomarker of CFTR function. The absolute change from baseline through Week 24 
was for SwCl -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal P<0.0001), for ppFEV1 from baseline 
through Week 24 was 11.0 percentage points (95% CI: 6.9, 15.1; nominal P<0.0001) and for CFQ-R 
RD score from baseline through Week 24 was 5.5 points (95% CI: 1.0, 10.0; nominal P = 0.0174). For 
all endpoints it can be concluded that the differences are clinically relevant. A reduction SwCl ≥ 10-15 
mmol/l has been accepted as minimum. In the authorisation study in children aged 6 through 12 years 
of TEZ/ELX/IVA a decrease of -60.9 mmol/L from baseline through week 24 has been observed.  
Preservation of lung function is a main goal in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The less impaired lung 
function in this younger population may be of influence for this difference. Therefore, the increase in 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 of 11.0% is considered an important 
improvement and the relevance is beyond doubt.  
The CFQ-R indicates is used to indicate a patient benefit in daily life. An increase of > 4 points 
indicates that the patient can perceive a change in daily life, expressed as minimal clinical important 
difference (MCID). The LS mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score was 5.5 points. This was above the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 
points.  
For each of the endpoints, not all participants had data available at all timepoints. The current analysis 
methods assume that the data are missing at random. Missing data was largely at week 24 (e.g. for 
LCI2.5 8.2% missing in placebo vs 16.7% in Kaftrio). Most common reason was ‘not meeting criteria’, 
and only in very few cases due AE, non-compliance, death, physician decision, or subject refusal or 
prohibited medication. Therefore, missing data can be considered not related to underlying outcome. 
For LCI2.5, the primary endpoint, also a jump-to-reference missing data imputation was performed and 
this confirmed the primary analysis. Thus, efficacy results are considered robust. 
Safety  
All 121 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the treatment period with a mean exposure 
of 23.7 weeks in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 24.0 weeks in the placebo group. 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 80.0% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 93.4% in the 
placebo group. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects in either treatment arm) were 
headache, cough, nasopharyngitis, productive cough, rhinorrhoea, rash, abdominal pain, 
oropharyngeal pain, and infective PEx of CF. Relevant differences in incidence of AEs that were more 
frequent in ELX/TEZ/IVA compared with placebo (n (%) were observed for rash (6 (10.0) vs 3 (4.9)), 
alanine aminotransferase increased (5 (8.3) vs 3 (4.9)), pruritus (4 (6.7) vs 0), staphylococcus test 
positive (4 (6.7) vs 1 (1.6)) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (3 (5.0) vs 1 (1.6)). An 
important difference in favour of ELX/TEZ/IVA was the relevant difference in infective PEx of CF being 
much higher in the placebo group 16 (26.2) compared to 1 (1.7) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group.  
Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF disease in 
CF subjects 6 through 11 years of ageand the differences are consistent with the established safety 
profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity, while only 2 (3.3%) subjects 
in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (3.3%) subjects in the placebo group had severe AEs. There were no 
life-threatening AEs and no deaths. 
Serious adverse event (SAE) occurred in 4 (6.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 9 (14.8%) 
subjects in the placebo group. No SAE occurred in more than 1 subject each in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. 
Three (4.9%) subjects in the placebo group had an SAE of infective pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of 
CF. Overall, the observed SAEs were consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF 
disease in CF children 6 through 11 years of age or with the established safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 1 (1.7%) subject discontinued study drug due to an AE (rash), and 7 
(11.7%) subjects interrupted study drug due to AEs, mostly ALT increased and AST increased. No 
subjects in the placebo group discontinued or interrupted study drug. Treatment interruption due to 
ALT increased and AST increased is a known effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF. 
Adverse event of specific interest (AESI) were transaminase elevations and rash, in line with the 
known effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA and previous procedures of ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA. Alanine 
transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) >3, >5, and >8 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
occurred in 8 (13.6%), 3 (5.1%), and 1 (1.7%) subject(s) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, compared to 3 
(4.9%), 1 (1.6%), and 0 subject(s) in the placebo group. No subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with 
concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. These finding are comparable to the findings of the 
authorisation trial in children 6 though 11 years of age, study VX18-445-10.  
Elevated transaminase events occurred in 6 (10.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (4.9%) 
subjects in the placebo group. All elevated transaminase events were mild or moderate in severity, and 
none were serious. Four (6.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group interrupted study drug due to 
elevated transaminase events.  
Rash events (AESI of rash) occurred in 8 (13.3%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (4.9%) 
subjects in the placebo group. The majority of rash events were mild or moderate in severity. One 
(1.7%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group discontinued the study drug because of a rash event. Two 
(3.3%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group interrupted study drug due to rash events; both subjects 
resumed study drug without recurrence of rash.  
Overall, the frequencies of the AESIs are in line with the frequencies found in the authorisation study 
VX18-445-106. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study VX19-445-116 is well designed and has a sufficient duration to evaluate efficacy and safety. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant, and clinically relevant improvement 
through 24 weeks in LCI2.5, as compared to placebo. This was supported by a clinically meaningful 
improvement through 24 weeks in SwCl, ppFEV1 and CFQ-R RD.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated for 24 weeks of treatment. No new safety concerns 
were identified as the data were generally consistent the safety profile in the authorisation studies of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in children 6 through 11 years as well as in adults and adolescents.  
The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive. 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding safety and efficacy of treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in study 116 
the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no 
later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  the applicant is requested to explain how the patients with values outside the in-and exclusion 
criteria were handled, e.g. patients with LCI2.5 < 7.5 and/or h ppFEV1< 70%.  
2.  The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 at week 24 was preferred instead of through Week 24. 
The applicant is requested to provide the results at D15.  
3.  For each of the endpoints, not all participants had data available at all timepoints. The current 
analysis methods assume that the data are missing at random. For each endpoint, the 
Applicant is requested to provide the missing data patterns over the full follow up period and 
provide any available details on the reasons for missing data. The Applicant is also asked to 
provide sufficient justification to support the assumption that the data are MAR. Further, the 
Applicant is requested to provide results from a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint 
based on a jump to reference missing data assumption.   
4.  The current study VX19-445-116 is well designed and has a sufficient duration to evaluate 
efficacy and safety. Because the registration study was hampered by missing data because of 
the Covid pandemic, it is considered that the study results are valuable to add to the SmPC. 
The applicant is requested to include the results. To be noted, only the results of the primary 
and key secondary endpoints will be accepted. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
The applicant is requested to explain how the patients with values outside the in-and 
exclusion criteria were handled, e.g. patients with LCI2.5 < 7.5 and/or ppFEV1< 70%.  
Applicant’s response 
Eligibility criteria for number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration 
to 1/40th of its starting value (LCI2.5) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(ppFEV1) were based on Screening Visit values. Subjects with post-screening values below these 
thresholds (ppFEV1 <70, LCI2.5 <7.5) were still considered to have met eligibility criteria. 
Overall, 14 (11.6%) subjects had ppFEV1 <70 at baseline (e.g., Day 1) and 7 (5.8%) subjects had 
LCI2.5 <7.5 at baseline (Table 14.1.4 and Adhoc Table 14.1.4.1). 
All subjects who met the Full Analysis Set (FAS) definition (all randomized subjects who carry the 
intended CFTR allele mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug) were included in the efficacy 
analysis, in line with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.

Assessment of the response  
The applicant explained that the subjects with baseline values LCI2.5 < 7.5 and/or ppFEV1< 70% were 
post screening and were still considered to have met eligibility criteria. Although it is acknowledged 
that there are usually some differences between screening and baseline values, the number of patients 
that were eligible but had lower values at baseline is considered rather high, i.e. 14 (11.6%) subjects 
with ppFEV1 <70 at baseline (e.g., Day 1) and 7 (5.8%) subjects had LCI2.5 <7.5 at baseline. 
Nevertheless, it is agreed that the subjects were eligible, based on most recent non-missing 
measurement collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 2 
The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 at week 24 was preferred instead of through Week 
24. The applicant is requested to provide the results at D15.  
Applicant’s response 
Absolute change in LCI2.5 at Day 15 is presented in Table 1. Results are consistent with the primary 
analysis of absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 (LS mean treatment difference of 
-2.26 [95% CI: -2.71, -1.81] for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group versus placebo). 
Table 1 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change from Baseline in LCI2.5 at Day 15 (FAS) 
Assessment of the response  
The applicant provided the results of D15 as requested. The results are consistent with the results of 
absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24.

Although the intention was to request for the results at week 24 as is mentioned in the discussion part, 
this information is found in Table 14.2.1.6.5 that showed that the difference in change from baseline at 
week 24 was -2.76 (-3.36, -2.16). 
Based on the above information, it is considered the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline at Week 
24 is also consistent (or a slightly better) than absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 
24. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved 
Question 3 
For each of the endpoints, not all participants had data available at all timepoints. The 
current analysis methods assume that the data are missing at random. For each endpoint, 
the Applicant is requested to provide the missing data patterns over the full follow up period 
and provide any available details on the reasons for missing data. The Applicant is also 
asked to provide sufficient justification to support the assumption that the data are MAR. 
Further, the Applicant is requested to provide results from a sensitivity analysis for the 
primary endpoint based on a jump to reference missing data assumption.   
Applicant’s response 
Overall, analyses of missing data patterns demonstrate that the amount of missing data in Study 116 
is low and support Vertex’s assumption that data are missing at random. Sensitivity analyses using 
reference-based multiple imputation for absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 are consistent with 
the primary analysis and do not affect the interpretation of results from Study 116. Additional details 
are provided below. 
Missing data 
Missing data at each visit for subjects with monotone missing data, (i.e., a visit is imputed only if all 
data are missing in subsequent visit[s]) and thus whose data are imputed, are presented in Adhoc 
Table 14.2.1.1.1 (LCI2.5), Adhoc Table 14.2.2.1.1 (SwCl), Adhoc Table 14.2.3.1.1 (CFQ-R RD score), 
and Adhoc Table 14.2.4.1.1 (ppFEV1). 
Imputed missing data were categorized into 1 of 2 categories: 
•  Category 1: subjects who discontinued treatment because of either adverse events (AEs); 
noncompliance with study drug, death, physician decision, or because the subject refused 
further dosing or required prohibited medications. 
•  Category 2: subjects who either completed 24 weeks of treatment or discontinued treatment 
not due to reasons listed in Category 1.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/627111/2022  
Page 33/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the amount of missing data through Week 24 was low and almost all subjects with missing 
data were in Category 2. For LCI2.5, 16 (13.2%) subjects had monotone missing data: 1 (0.8%) 
subject was in Category 1 (discontinuation due to an AE) and 15 (12.4%) subjects were in Category 2. 
The primary reason for missing data was assessments not meeting criteria.  
Because assessment of multiple-breath washout criteria was independent of the efficacy data, Vertex 
considers that the missing-at-random assumption is reasonable. 
Similar trends were observed for sweat chloride (SwCl), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-
R), and ppFEV1; the amount of missing data through Week 24 was low, and the majority of subjects 
with missing data were in Category 2.  
Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis using reference-based multiple imputation was performed for the primary 
endpoint of absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 24 (Table 2). Results were 
consistent with the primary analysis. A similar sensitivity analysis by visit is presented in Adhoc Table 
14.2.1.6.5. 
Table 2 Sensitivity Analysis: MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change From Baseline in LCI2.5 
Through Week 24 With Reference-Based Multiple Imputation (FAS) 
Assessment of the response  
The applicant provided the following results.  
LCI2.5. Missing data was absent up to week 8, 1.6% (placebo) vs 5.0% (Kaftrio) at week 16, and 8.2% 
vs 18.4% in week 24. Virtually all this missing data was of category 2 (at most 1.7% in category 1, so 
at most 1.7% due to either AE, non-compliance, death, physician decision, or subject refusal or 
prohibited medication), and by the words of the Applicant mostly due to not meeting criteria (no 
further details were provided). The applicant explained that the primary reason for missing data was 
assessments not meeting criteria. ‘Not meeting criteria’ can be considered to be unrelated to the 
outcome because performing a valid pulmonary function test is prone to some invalid measurements 
due to the technical challenges.

The primary analysis for LCI2.5 (change from baseline *through* week 24) showed an effect of -2.26 (-
2.71, -1.81) and the reference based showed imputation -2.32 ( -2.76, -1.88). As most missings were 
in the Kaftrio arm, the reference based imputation is not to expected to favour the Kaftrio arm. In 
table 14.2.1.6.5 also the change from baseline *at* week 24 were provided: -2.76 (-3.36, -2.16). 
These results thus fully support the main analysis.  
Sweat Chloride: Missing data was absent up to week 8, 1.6% (placebo) vs 1.7% (Kaftrio) at week 16, 
13.1% vs 5% at week 24, mostly present in category 2. Although more missingness in the placebo, 
this is not expected to change the large effect (-51.2 mmol/L, (-55.3, -47.1)).  
CFQ-R: Missing data was absent up to week 8, 0% (placebo) vs 1.7% (Kaftrio) at week 16, 3.3% vs 
3.4% at week 24, mostly present in category 2. Given the similar drop-out, the original analysis is 
likely robust. 
ppFEV1: Missing data was absent up to week 8, 9.8% (placebo) vs 10% (Kaftrio) at week 16, 21.3% 
vs 20.0% at week 24, mostly present in category 2. Given the similar drop-out, the original analysis is 
likely robust. 
Overall, robustness is considered to be shown. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved  
Question 4 
The current study VX19-445-116 is well designed and has a sufficient duration to evaluate 
efficacy and safety. Because the registration study was hampered by missing data because 
of the Covid pandemic, it is considered that the study results are valuable to add to the 
SmPC. The applicant is requested to include the results. To be noted, only the results of the 
primary and key secondary endpoints will be accepted. 
Applicant’s response 
Vertex acknowledges that results from Study 116 may provide additional value and agrees to include 
results from the primary and key secondary endpoints in the SmPC. New text to added to the product 
information is underlined. Current text to be deleted is strikethrough.

In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and a minimal function mutation), treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
resulted in reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The LS mean 
treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for absolute 
change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; 
nominal P<0.0001). 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
[…] 
Study 445-116 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 
to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.2 years) who were heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 121 patients were randomised to receive either 
placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA weighing <30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg 
tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline 
were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg 
tablet in the evening. At screening, patients had a ppFEV1 ≥70% [mean ppFEV1 at baseline of 89.3% 
(range: 44.6%, 121.8%)], LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 [mean LCI2.5 at baseline of 10.01 (range: 6.91, 18.36)], 
and weighed ≥15 kg.

Patients who had lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary 
status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, or Mycobacterium 
abscessus, or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT ≥3 x ULN, 
or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN), were excluded. Patients in studies 445-102 and 445-103 were eligible to 
roll over into a 96-week open label extension study (Study 445 105). Patients in studies 445 104, and 
445 106, and 445-116 were eligible to roll over into separate open-label extension studies.

Study 445-116 
In study 445-116, treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in statistically 
significant improvement through 24 weeks in the primary endpoint (LCI2.5). The LS mean treatment 
difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change 
in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 was -2.26 (95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P<0.0001).

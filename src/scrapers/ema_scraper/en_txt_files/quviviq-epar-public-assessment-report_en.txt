2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5, 2013), insomnia 
disorder is defined as “a predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with one (or 
more) of the following symptoms:  
(i) 
difficulty initiating sleep,  
(ii) 
difficulty maintaining sleep characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep 
after awakenings, 
(iii) 
early‑morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.  
The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment with detrimental effects on daytime 
functioning,  including  social,  occupational,  educational,  academic,  behavioural,  or  other  important  areas  of 
functioning”.  
Similar  diagnostic  criteria  for  insomnia  disorder  were  defined  in  the  International  Classification  of  Sleep 
Disorders. 3rd Edition (ICSD-3, 2014). 
Insomnia  is  associated  with  an  abnormal  state  of  hyperarousal  that  overrides  the  normal  control  of  sleep. 
Orexin is a central promotor of arousal and vigilance.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Population-based  studies  across  several  European  countries  in  the  last  20  years  have  found  an  insomnia 
prevalence between 5 and 19%.  
Insomnia disorder occurs in all age groups. There is no clear relationship between insomnia prevalence and 
age, with several studies yielding conflicting results. Insomnia disorder occurs more frequently in females than 
in males.  
Longitudinal studies in Europe and US have found an annual insomnia incidence of 2–5%. For the elderly adult 
population, no incidence data are available for insomnia disorder.  
Predisposing  factors  and  factors  that  facilitate  the  development  of  insomnia  include  demographic  variables, 
familial/hereditary conditions, psychological factors, and health related factors. 
In addition to female sex, poor physical and mental health are main risk factors for insomnia. Individuals with 
certain psychological features, such as increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, worries, and lower ability 
to cope with stressful events are more prone to develop insomnia. Stress exposure in the form of severe and 
chronic life events is also a risk factor for the onset of insomnia. Chronic conditions with pain often precede the 
development of insomnia. A history of insomnia in first-degree family members also represents a risk factor, 
with genetic and epigenetic factors involved in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia, although the 
genetic basis for insomnia is not well characterised.

2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The diagnosis of insomnia on a clinician’s assessment of a patient’s conditions consistent with the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5, 2013) or the International Classification of 
Sleep Disorders. 3rd Edition (ICSD-3, 2014). 
Insomnia disorder is defined as “a predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with 
one (or more) of the following symptoms: difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep characterized 
by  frequent  awakenings  or  problems  returning  to  sleep  after  awakenings,  early‑morning  awakening  with 
inability to return to sleep.  
The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment with detrimental effects on daytime 
functioning,  including  social,  occupational,  educational,  academic,  behavioral,  or  other  important  areas  of 
functioning”.  
The definition of insomnia within the ICSD-3 largely follows that of the DSM-5 with the importance of the impact 
on daytime functioning. The patient complaint is an important part of the diagnosis leading to the importance 
of taking into account subjective criteria for drug efficacy assessment, as mentioned in the European Guideline 
on medicinal products for the treatment of insomnia (EMA, 2011). 
2.1.4.  Management 
According  to  treatment  guidelines  from  the  US  and  Europe,  the  first-line  treatment  is  Insomnia-specific 
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-i). Pharmacological intervention can be offered when CBT-i is not effective 
or not available. 
Use of hypnotic drugs is currently mostly recommended for short-term treatment, or as a temporary adjunct 
to CBT-i, due to safety limitations of existing drugs.  
Pharmacological  treatment  consists  of  benzodiazepines,  non-benzodiazepine  GABA-A  receptor  agonists, 
melatonin  receptor  agonists,  and  drugs  that  are  administered  off-label  (e.g.,  sedating  antidepressants, 
antihistamines). 
Two Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist DORAs (the drug class of daridorexant) are approved in some regions for 
the treatment of insomnia characterised by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance: suvorexant 
has  been  approved  since  2014  in  some  regions,  including  the  US,  Japan,  Canada  and  Australia,  while 
lemborexant has been approved since 2019 in some regions including the US, Japan and Canada. In Europe, 
no DORA is currently approved for the treatment of insomnia. 
In addition, several over-the-counter herbal medicines and devices are used by people with insomnia. 
2.2.  About the product 
Daridorexant, also known as ACT-541468, is a specific and potent DORA acting on both orexin 1 (OX1) and 
orexin 2 (OX2) receptors. The orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) act on orexin receptors to promote 
wakefulness. It could therefore be hypothesized that daridorexant will act both on sleep maintenance and on 
sleep latency in contrast with hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and z-drugs which act mainly on sleep latency.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is a complete and independent application.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 25 or 50 mg of daridorexant as active 
substance. The product contains the hydrochloride salt. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet  core:  mannitol,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  povidone,  croscarmellose  sodium,  silicon  dioxide  and 
magnesium stearate 
Film-coat: Hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, glycerol, talc, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red, iron oxide 
black and iron oxide yellow (50 mg tablets only). 
The product is available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated with polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC) and laminated 
with PVC film blister sealed with an aluminium foil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of daridorexant hydrochloride is [(S)-2-(5-chloro-4-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-2-
methylpyrrolidin-1-yl](5-methoxy-2-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)phenyl)methanone hydrochloride corresponding to 
the molecular formula C23H23ClN6O2.HCl. It has a molecular mass of 450.93 g/mol (free base) or 487.38 
g/mol (salt) and the following structure: 
.HCl 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of daridorexant hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C, NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectrophotometry, and elemental analysis. The solid-state 
properties of the active substance were measured by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning 
calorimetry, gravimetric vapour sorption and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).

The active substance is a white to light yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in 
acidic media but insoluble at neutral pH. Particle size is controlled in the active substance specification 
following the micronisation step. The proposed manufacturing process routinely delivers the desired 
polymorphic form. Daridorexant contains a single chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by 
chiral HPLC in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Daridorexant hydrochloride is synthesized in 3 main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Although several impurities which originate upstream of the starting materials, were listed in the active 
substance specification, the synthetic routes for the starting materials had not been described in sufficient 
detail and the control of impurities, including those which are potentially mutagenic, was deemed insufficient. 
In addition, a raw material representing a significant structural fragment of the active substance, was not 
originally proposed as a starting material but as a reagent. Therefore, the CHMP raised two major objections 
in relation to the definition of and control strategy for the initially proposed starting materials. Firstly, the 
MAH was asked to re-define the proposed starting materials and secondly, to provide more detail on their 
routes of synthesis including reagents and catalysts used, as well as on their impurity profiles and the 
subsequent fate and purge of these impurities. 
In response, the applicant explained how the impurities which originate upstream of the starting materials 
and carry over into the active substance can be considered “impurities that persist” according to ICH Q11 
Q&A 5.8. They are structurally similar to the active substance and thus are not readily purged. Limits for 
these impurities in the starting materials were tightened, rather than re-defined the starting materials. 
Furthermore, a detailed description of the actual and potential impurities in the starting materials was 
provided, including an explanation of the control of mutagenic impurities which are controlled according to 
ICH M7. The Applicant also defined another starting material. The CHMP considered the applicant’s approach 
acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The control strategy for impurities was justified by provision of extensive fate and 
purge data. Acceptable limits have been set in raw materials, intermediates, and the active substance. 
Critical steps were discussed and suitable process parameter controls are in place to ensure the purge of key 
impurities. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. The same principle route was used 
throughout with optimised conditions introduced as development progressed. 
Material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification shown in Error! Reference source not found. includes tests for 
appearance, colour, sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), identity (IR, HPLC), identity of chloride (Ph. 
Assessment report

Eur.), chloride content (titration), residual solvents (GC-HS), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), enantiomeric 
ratio (chiral HPLC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Limits for specified and total 
impurities were tightened during the procedure following a request from CHMP. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 12 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 24 
months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 9 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, colour, water content, impurities, assay, enantiomeric ratio, particle size distribution and 
microbial quality. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No 
significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under all three conditions and no 
trends were noted. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. The active substance is 
photostable in the solid state. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted on the solid active substance and in solution.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed container without 
specific storage conditions. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release triangle-shaped film-coated tablet, approximately 7 mm in 
diameter and 4 mm in thickness. The 25 mg and 50 mg strengths are the same size and weight and are 
distinguished by colour and debossing. The 25 mg tablet is light purple and debossed with “25” on one face. 
The 50 mg tablet is light orange and debossed with “50” on one face. Both tablets are debossed with the 
MAH logo on the other face (Figure 2).

Figure 2: finished product appearance 
The goal of pharmaceutical development was an immediate release tablet with a rapid disintegration time 
and a high dissolution rate in acidic media. The most stable of the known crystalline forms has been selected. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality (or the quality of the components 
of the film-coating mix) is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.4.1 of this report. The amounts of excipients used in the composition have been adequately justified. The 
development approach is based on an understanding of the relationship between formulation inputs and 
manufacturing process parameters on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of finished product such as 
appearance, content uniformity, assay, related substances, dissolution rate, shelf life and microbiological 
contamination defined according to the quality target product profile (QTPP). An overview of the formulations 
used in clinical trials was presented, including hard and soft gelatin capsules used in phase 1 and phase 2. 
Triangular 7 mm film-coated tablets were developed at strengths of 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg for use in 
pivotal phase 3 trials and for commercialisation. Clinical and the commercial tablets have a different 
appearance but this is not expected to impact their in vivo performance. 
The discriminatory power of the QC method was investigated using finished product manufactured with active 
substance with different particle sizes and with batches manufactured with meaningful changes in relevant 
parameters (e.g. over-granulated, change on granulation liquid content, different amounts of excipients). The 
proposed dissolution method was able to reject mis-manufactured batches and is thus considered as 
acceptable. The proposed release and shelf-life dissolution limits, some of which were tightened during the 
procedure, are considered acceptable. However, the applicant is recommended to tighten the shelf-life limit 
of the 50 mg tablet once additional real time stability data has been generated. 
Optimisation of the manufacturing process was carried out using elements of the QbD approach for the 
granulation step. A traditional approach was used for the optimisation of the final blending and tableting 
steps. Target set-points have been defined for all process parameters with PARs assigned to others. The 
proposed PARs have been adequately justified. For each process step, only one process parameter at a time 
can be varied within its PAR while others are maintained at the defined target. 
The development experiments are considered satisfactory for optimising the manufacturing process, for 
challenging the scaling-up and also for showing the robustness of the proposed manufacturing process. The 
overall control strategy is considered adequate for this type of formulation and manufacturing process. 
The commercial process will be run on a larger scale than that used for clinical batches and as a result, some 
parameters for granulation, drying, compression and film coating steps needed to be modified to 
accommodate scale and equipment changes. However, comparative dissolution profiles between the clinical 
and proposed commercial batches were not provided in the initial submission. In response to the resultant 
Assessment report

major objection raised by the CHMP, the parameters for the planned validation campaign were adjusted 
accordingly results from one validation batch were provided.No impact on dissolution rate was observed 
between biobatches and those used for scale-up and validation using the quality control (QC) dissolution 
method. The primary packaging is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated with polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC) and 
laminated with PVC film blister sealed with an aluminium foil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process and in-process controls consists of four main steps: blending of intra-granular 
excipients and granulation; blending with extra-granular excipients; compression; film-coating. The process 
is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 pilot scale batches of each strength tablet 
by the proposed manufacturer. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. An acceptable process validation 
scheme has been submitted, explaining how the process will be validated on 3 productions scale batches of 
each tablet strength prior to commercialization. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance (visual), colour (visual), water content (KF), identity (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product specifications are in line with ICH Q6A. Limits for impurities are acceptable according to 
ICH Q3B. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was assessed following a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data from 15 batches 
was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the 
respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
performed considering root causes mentioned in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing 
authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment 
report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). However, some of the potential root causes applicable to Quviviq 
had been omitted resulting in a major objection. In response, the applicant provided a comprehensive risk 
assessment covering all potential sources of nitrosamines, which were considered satisfactory. Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or 
the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 18 months under intermediate conditions (30 
ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, colour, 
water content, dissolution, assay and degradation products. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. An increase in water content was observed, along with a decrease in dissolution rate, under all 
storage conditions, more so at higher humidity and temperature. The changes are small and both parameters 
remained within specification throughout the studies. No trends to any of the other measured parameters 
were observed. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is not photosensitive. Additional studies 
under stressed conditions indicate the finished product is not sensitive to light, to heat, basic stress and high 
and frozen temperature cycles whereas some degradation occurs on exposure to acidic and oxidative stress 
conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The major objections relating to the choice of starting materials was resolved by providing additional 
information on impurity origin, fate and purge and by defining an additional starting material. Provision of 
comparative dissolution data between biobatches and batches manufactured on commercial scale resolved a 
major objection relating to comparability of batches made by different processes. Finally, the applicant 
provided additional risk assessment and purge data relating to the potential formation of nitrosamines 
impurities to resolve the fourth major objection.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to tighten the dissolution shelf-life limit of the 50 mg tablet once 
additional real time stability data has been generated. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical testing strategy was based on the ICH M3 guideline and other applicable nonclinical ICH 
guidelines. Daridorexant was formulated in the in vivo non-clinical studies to comply with the clinical route. 
Drug substance investigated in the non-clinical programme is the hydrochloride salt of Daridorexant.  
Non-clinical development of daridorexant (ACT-541468) included an exhaustive programme. Dedicated 
studies were included to support plasma profiles of metabolites in humans and to investigate their 
pharmacological properties. Species selection was based on pharmacologically relevant binding to Orexin 
receptors in humans and in these non-clinical species with high selectivity and potency, metabolically 
relevant pathways in these species are similar to those in humans, as well as close plasma protein binding 
properties for some species only. Doses for the pharmacodynamic studies were chosen to evaluate a range of 
dose-response activity that was considered to include both primary and secondary effects. Consistent with 
ICH M3, the high doses for toxicity studies were selected to provide substantial challenge to the test animals 
and cause systemic pharmacological and toxic effects.  Low doses were selected to provide no-observed-
effect and/or no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOEL, NOAEL).  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Low  Log  D  value  of  Daridorexant  (ACT-541468)  supported  a  brain  penetration  potential,  that  was 
experimentally  confirmed  in  a  pharmacology  wake-sleep  Wistar  rat  model,  in  which  Daridorexant  was 
demonstrated to cross blood-brain-barrier at doses pharmacologically active (resulting in -26% and -74% of 
the total sleep time following oral administration of 30 and 100mg/kg, respectively).  Whole brain concentration 
of  ACT-541468  reached  3206ng/g  (71nM  brain-free)  and  5201ng/g  (115nM  brain-free)  1h  following  oral 
administration of 30 and 100mg/kg, respectively.  
In cell-based assays, Daridorexant antagonized orexin-A–induced calcium release at OX1 and OX2 receptors, 
with similar high potencies at human, rat, and dog orexin receptors.

The 3 major human metabolites acted also as dual antagonists at both the OX1 and OX2 receptors, with free 
apparent Kb values ranging from 28 to 1035 nM and from 7.0 to 458 nM, respectively. These Kb values for 
human OX1/OX2 receptors were greater than those of ACT-541468A: at least 44/8-fold for M3, 81/47-fold for 
M1,  1545/555-fold  for  M10.  Then  M3  had  the  highest  potency  among  metabolites  and  M1  had  the  lowest 
potency on both receptors. On the whole, metabolites showed higher selectivity for OX2 receptor (3.9(M3), 
2.26(M10),  1.4(M1)-fold),  then  these  metabolites,  displayed  significantly  lower  potency  at  both  OX1R  and 
OX2R  than  daridorexant.  Given  free  apparent  Kb  at  OX2  for  the  parent  is  at  least  10-fold  lower  than  for 
metabolites,  the  contribution  of  metabolites  to  an  OX2-mediated  activity  may  be  low.  Considering  their 
abundance in human plasma, the high binding to plasma proteins, substrate potential for f P-gp which would 
limit  their  brain  penetration,  and  lower  potency  on  OX1R  and  OX2R  compared  to  parent  drug,  unbound 
concentrations of the these metabolites in the brain would not contribute to in vivo sleep-promoting activity in 
animals and humans  
Daridorexant  dose-dependently  decreases  wakefulness  and  promotes  sleep  in  rats  and  dogs,  with  onset  of 
somnolence within the first hour after administration and the effect of ACT-541468 on sleep lasted for 6 h at 
least. In both species, it decreases the latency to persistent non-REM sleep and increases both non-REM and 
REM  sleep  times;  the  proportion  of  non-REM  and  REM  sleep  within  the  total  sleep  time  is  not  affected  by 
daridorexant treatment.  
The  lowest  pharmacological  dose,  which  achieved  statistically  significant  decreasing  effects  on  home  cage 
activity, total sleep and total wake times, and latency to persistent non-REM sleep, was 30 mg/kg, and the 
effects lasted at least 6 h. At this dose, during the first 6h night period post administration, the home cage 
activity decreased by 30.9% and the time spent in active wake by 21.9% (32min). Total sleep time increased 
by  39.2%  (34  min;  including  21  min  of  non-REM  sleep  and  13  min  of  REM  sleep).  At  30mg/kg,  free 
concentrations in the brain reached 71nM at 1h following administration, with a brain/plasma ratio of 218%. 
Latency to the first persistent episode of non-REM sleep was markedly decreased from the lowest dose tested 
of 10 mg/kg (17 min compared with 61 min latency with vehicle), whereas total sleep time, total wake time or 
home cage activity were not significantly changed at this dose. Analysis of the EEG spectral frequencies within 
the sleep/wake stages showed that the spectral pattern of the different stages was not altered by ACT-541468 
at the highest dose of 300mg/kg in contrast to the GABAA receptor modulator zolpidem. It can be concluded 
that ACT-541468 decreases wakefulness and compensates by increasing total sleep without altering the general 
sleep architecture of adult rats.  
ACT-541468A did not induce muscular weakness in the activation test with food upon awakening, and did not 
affect motor performance in the rotarod and grip strength tests at any dose (10-100 mg/kg) that were effective 
on sleep-wake cycle. Zolpidem impaired motor performance in the tests in a dose-dependent manner. It means 
that rats under ACT-541468A treatment that are woken up from sleep are able to perform normally on the 
rotarod and grip strength tasks, then motor function upon awakening is expected not affected in humans at 
clinically effective dose in contrast to drugs for insomnia, which are GABAA receptor modulators and known to 
elicit  a  number  of  side-effects  such  as  residual  sleepiness,  motor  incoordination,  memory  and  cognitive 
impairment, and abuse liability. Then sleep promoted by ACT-541468 can be considered surmountable in rats 
as no next day residual occurred. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
ACT-541468A and its major metabolites M1, M3, and M10 were tested against a large and usual panel of ion 
channels, receptors, transporters, and enzymes. Concentration of ACT-541468, M1 and M3 able to result in 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 16/141 
 
 
 
 
off-target activities are considerably higher than the human free Cmax reached at 50mg/day highest clinical 
dose.  As  the  mean  free  human  Cmax  of  ACT-541468  at  clinical  dose  of  50  mg/day  is  3.0ng/mL  (6.7  nM), 
effective concentrations on the dopamine transporter, the adrenergic β3 receptor, and PDE4 are 2134-, 2493-
, and 1493-fold higher, respectively.  Considering the mean  free human Cmax of M1 at ACT-541468 clinical 
dose, effective concentrations on the AT1, NK3, and OP2 receptors were approximately 44,000-, 37,000- and 
27,000-fold higher than  M1  human  free  Cmax,  respectively.  As  the  mean  free  human  Cmax  of  M3  at ACT-
541468 clinical dose of 50 mg/day is 2.12 ng/mL, effective concentrations on the dopamine transporter was 
approximately 4,700-fold higher than M3 human free Cmax. No off-target is anticipated during human use. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
In the usual GLP-hERG assay, Daridorexant led to a concentration-dependent reduction of inward and outward 
K+  currents.  IC20  is  at  least  >1000-fold  higher  than  the  free  Cmax  observed  in  humans  at  clinical  dose  of 
50mg/day.  The  risk  for  daridorexant-induced  QT  prolongation  in  humans  is  considered  low  given  the  large 
safety margin to the hERG channel blockade. The 3 major human plasma metabolites accounting for 28.9% 
(M3), 12.7% (M1), and 9.0% (M10) of total drug-related material are intrinsically covered taking into account 
%Fu. 
Telemetred Beagle dogs administered by the oral route up to the dose 100mg/kg, did not relevantly modify 
the arterial blood pressure (mean, systolic and diastolic) and the duration of the QTc intervals and of the QRS 
complex, and body temperature during the 24h period following administration when compared with vehicle 
values. Considering the low amplitude and no dose-dependent changes in heart rate and PR, RR and QT interval 
durations, the NOAEL was established at the maximal dose of 100 mg/kg in this GLP study. The free Cmax 
values at this dose were at least 120-fold higher than exposure at clinical dose of 50mg/day in humans. These 
data do not support high risk for a clinical safety concern due to large safety margin and low amplitude effects. 
This  is  in  line  with  the  clinical  TQT  study,  which  results  excluded  QTcF  prolongation  >10ms  up  to 
supratherapeutic plasma concentrations of  daridorexant. Given known metabolites exposure in the  39-week 
study in dogs, exposure multiples are from 15 to 118-fold compared to human exposure at 50 mg/kg, then no 
further study is needed. 
Effects  on  hemodynamic  and  cardiac  parameters,  body  temperature,  and  locomotor  activity  were  also 
investigated in non-GLP studies in conscious normotensive versus spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and 
in anesthetized guinea pigs. Transient and low amplitude effect on these parameters occurred at mean Cmax 
value 52-fold above the human exposure at the 50mg/day dose in normotensive rats. ACT-541468A induced a 
slight decrease in heart rate and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, body temperature) in SHRs at Cmax 62-
fold higher than human exposure at highest clinical dose. The NOEL for cardiovascular function in guinea pigs 
was established at 30mg/kg, corresponding to a mean Cmax of 23,265 ng/mL that is largely higher than human 
exposure at clinical dose of 50mg/kg. Data suggest also a low risk in hypertensive patients. 
Single oral administration of Daridorexant up to 1000 mg/kg was associated with reduced activity and arousal 
within  0.5-5h,  supported  by  the  observation  of  several  hyporeactive  rats  in  each  test  item-treated  group, 
increased palpebral closure and tremor scores, decreased postural and arousal scores, and lower exploratory 
activity  during  a  GLP-compliant  Irwin  test.  Most  effects  disappeared  within  following  24h  after  dosing,  only 
exploratory  activity  remained  still  lower  at  1000mg/kg.  When  animals  were  stimulated,  their  behavioural 
responses  did  not  noticeably  differ  from  those  noted  in  animals  from  the  vehicle  group.  None  of  the  signs 
adversely  affected  the  health  of  the  animals  up  to  300  mg/kg  based  on  temperature,  body  weight  gain, 
activity/CNS excitability, autonomic functions, gait and muscle tone, motor and sensory reflexes, then NOAEL

is estimated 300mg/kg. An increased incidence and severity of tremors from 100 mg/kg, and lower body weight 
gain may be secondary to hyporeactivity and increased immobility. Findings are related to the pharmacological 
activity of daridorexant, and such effects occurred in rats and dogs at free Cmax >86-fold human free Cmax 
at clinical dose of 50 mg/day.  It is unclear whether rectal temperature decrease up to  -2.1°C/-1°C at 1000 
mg/kg may be cause or consequence of CNS-related effects.  
Similarly, daridorexant up to the dose of 1000mg/kg, did not exert any biologically relevant effect on the tidal 
and minute volumes, the respiratory rate, the inspiratory, expiratory and relaxation times, the peak inspiratory 
and  expiratory  flows,  and  on  the  enhanced  pause  as  evaluated  by  whole-body  plethysmography  in  freely 
moving rats.  This study supports no expected respiratory adverse effect in human at clinical dose. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The disposition of ACT-541468 has been studied in (Wistar) rats and (Beagle) dogs, which are the species used 
in pharmacology and toxicology programmes. The concentrations of ACT-541468 were at least quantified in 
plasma samples from at least toxicology relevant species, rat and dog, using validated LC-MS/MS method.  
Absorption 
Absorption parameters were mainly characterized after a single dose and after oral multiple doses in rats and 
dogs, which are the species used in pharmacology and toxicology programmes.  
Single dose studies indicated that: 
-Mean  plasma  clearance  was  49-74  mL/min/kg  in  the  rat  and  9.8  mL/min/kg  in  the  dog,  the  volume  of 
distribution was in large excess of total body water, and terminal half-lives were in the range of 0.5-2.1h in the 
rat and 2.5-4.1h in the dog. 
-Oral absorption of Daridorexant was rapid in rats and dogs, with Cmax at 0.3h post-dose in the rat, 0.8-2h in 
the fasted dog versus 2.5h in the fed dog (Cmax and AUC0 was 1.3-fold higher). Oral bioavailability was in the 
range of 10-30% and 31-58% in rats and dogs, respectively. Oral bioavailability of Daridotrexant in rats is not 
dose-dependent, but oral bioavailability increased with dose in dogs. 
-In rats, AUC generally increased in a more than proportional manner with increasing oral doses  from  1 to 
30mg/kg.  As  a  significant  first-pass  extraction  was  observed,  saturation  of  metabolic  processes  during  oral 
absorption might contribute to the observed non-linear PK. In dogs, exposure to Daridorexant increased in a 
broadly linear manner with respect to oral doses. Higher inter-animal variability in plasma exposure occurred 
in dogs than in rats. This variability is believed to depend on intrinsic factor as Daridorexant plasma clearance 
in the dog showed similar inter-animal variability.  
- In contrast to dogs, some gender effect was observed in rats, with females exhibiting slightly lower clearance, 
but highest oral bioavailability, Cmax and AUC values. 
Pharmacokinetics of Daridorexant after multiple doses were documented from 4-week toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs, but metabolites were not measured. Slight more than dose-proportionally increase in exposure is 
globally  observed  in  rats  and  dogs.    Some  gender-related  effect  had  been  identified  in  rats,  females  being 
generally  more  exposed  to  ACT-541468  with  increasing  doses.  No  accumulation  (week  4/day  1  ratio)  was 
observed in rats. In the dog, a slight gender effect may be possible. Daridorexant accumulated by about 2-fold 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 18/141 
 
 
 
 
at  30-100mg/kg  over  the  4-week  treatment  period.  Daridorexant  may  slightly  accumulated  between 
administrations for dogs (with week 4/day ratio around 1.4-2), with lowest accumulation at highest dose.   
Distribution 
Vss of Daridotrexant was measured in PK studies superior to the body water volume and increased with dose 
in rats and dogs, supporting distribution in  tissues. High unbound plasma concentrations facilitate also drug 
partitioning into tissues. This in a favour to achieve high exposure for free concentration of  Daridorexant on 
the toxicological species used in pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies (rat and dog).  
Interspecies  differences  occurred  for  Daridorexant  as  maximal  unbound  fractions  ranged  from  0.3–0.5% 
(rabbits and humans) to 2.4–2.8% in rodents and dogs, with some concentration-dependent plasma protein 
binding  (non-linearity  due  to  protein  binding  saturable  at  lower  concentration  and  decreased  binding  with 
increasing  concentration)  in  in  vitro  assay.  Variability  of  human  plasma  binding  was  low  as  assessed  from 
clinical sample from  the single-ascending dose  study  AC-078-101 with  subjects treated 25  mg and 200 mg 
(mean plasma protein binding ranged 99.7–99.9%). Then free plasma fraction are the lowest in humans and 
range for humans/non-clinical species from 0-1-0.3%/ 0.4-1.5% for M1, 0.4-1.4%/6.2-12% for M3 and 4.0-
7.8%/19.0-31.0% M10 respectively. The non-linear human  plasma binding  in  vitro  was also observed as in 
non-clinical species. Free plasma fraction are the lowest in humans and range for humans/ on-clinical species/ 
from  0-1-0.3%/0.4-1.5%  for  M1,  0.4-1.4%/6.2-12%  for  M3  and  4.0-7.8%/19.0-31.0%  M10  respectively. 
Strong in vitro plasma protein binding for the parent compound is at least attributable to serum albumin and 
α1-acid glycoprotein (>93.9% and >70.2%, respectively) in humans.  
As a remark, as Daridorexant is highly bound to plasma sample from human subjects administered 50-200 mg 
Daridorexant (with no evidence of significant inter-subject and dose-related variability in human plasma protein 
binding properties) and in plasma of non-clinical species, calculation of exposure ratio based on free Cmax and 
AUC is agreed for discussion of safety margins within the safety programme.   
The  blood/plasma  ratios  were  concentration‑dependent,  likely  as  a  consequence  of  the  increased  unbound 
concentrations in plasma: 1.33 and 1.67 in mouse, 2.07 and 2.32 in rat, 0.82 and 1.15 in rabbit, 0.67 and 0.96 
in dog, 0.54 and 1.06 in human at 0.5 and 20μg/mL. In human blood, the mean percentage of radioactivity 
associated with red blood cells and blood/plasma ratios increased steadily from 1.1% to 50%. The blood/plasma 
partitioning ratios support that daridorexant did not significantly partition into blood cells in rabbits, dogs and 
humans (50%<) contrary to rodents (>50%). These blood/plasma ratios were concentration‑dependent, likely 
as  a  consequence  of  the  increased  unbound  concentrations  in  plasma.  To  conclude  the  non-linear  plasma 
binding  manifests  as  dose-dependent increases  in the  volume  of  distribution at  steady  state  and  prolonged 
half-lives. 
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography in the albino versus pigmented rats indicated that Daridorexant was 
rapidly absorbed in all tissues with highest total radioactivity at 0.5h post dose, mainly in the gastrointestinal 
mucosa, the liver and kidney, adrenal gland, brown fat, and myocardium. The radioactivity decreased to the 
limit of quantification at 24h post dose in most tissues and blood except the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, 
and no remaining radioactivity was detected 7 days post-dose in any tissue. The fact radioactivity remained 
important in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract up to 72h may correlate to usual gastrointestinal tract 
transit times after an oral administration. The presence of Daridorexant-associated radioactivity in the kidney 
pyramid  and  urinary  bladder  up  to  24h,  as  well  as  in  bile  ducts  up  to  4h,  suggest  that  renal  and  biliary 
elimination occurred. Autoradiograms support also a rapid brain penetration within the 0.5h post-dose to 34% 
of the respective levels of blood, and no accumulation in rats. The choroid plexuses from one of the interfaces

that control the brain microenvironment by regulating the exchanges between the blood and the central nervous 
system, and it was confirmed rapid exposure  of  cerebrospinal fluid after oral administration as radioactivity 
was detected only at this time at choroid plexuses. Brain/plasma ratios reached up to 218% after oral in a 
pharmacology study in rats, and the achieved brain concentrations were demonstrated appropriate in rats to 
decrease active wake time and increased total sleep time. Unchanged parent drug, M1, M2, M3, M5 and M13 
were detected in their brain. 
Given there were no significant differences in tissue distribution and elimination of radioactivity in pigmented 
versus  albino  rats,  and  no  retention  of  radioactivity  in  the  uveal  tract/retina  and  pigmented  skin,  this  may 
suggest daridorexant (or metabolites) is not able to bind to melanin and a low concern for risk associated to 
phototoxicity. 
Metabolism 
A total of 77 metabolites of daridorexant were identified in human plasma, urine, and feces. Three  metabolites 
accounted each for 9% or more of the total drug-related material in human plasma: M3 (28.9%), M1 (12.7%), 
and M10 (9.0%). Non-clinical exposure to these 3 metabolites was confirmed appropriate to support at least 
equivalent level in toxicology programme. Daridorexant was metabolized along several metabolic pathways:  
1) Aliphatic hydroxylation of the methyl benzimidazole moiety yielded M3. The alcohol M3 underwent further 
stepwise  oxidation to  its  aldehyde  M1  and  its  acid M2.  Other  downstream  products  of  M3  resulted  from  O-
demethylation to M12, Odemethylation and oxidation to the carboxylic acid M13, and glucuronidation to M30. 
2)  O-demethylation  of  daridorexant  led  to  the  phenol  M4.  Downstream  products  of  M4  included  M31  as  a 
product of formal addition of water. M31 is subsequently oxidized to M22. M4 is also glucuronidated to M9, 
which is further hydroxylated to M17. Hydroxylation of M4 at the triazole ring followed by glucuronidation yields 
M20. 
3)  Hydroxylation  of  daridorexant  at  the  α-carbon  position  of  the  pyrrolidine  ring  produced  M5.  This  initial 
product  then  ring-opened  to  an  aminoaldehyde,  and  finally  yielded  a  piperidinol  via  re-cyclization  of  the 
aldehyde  with  the  benzimidazole  moiety.  Downstream  metabolites  of  M5  were  M7  resulting  from  O-
demethylation, and M10 resulting from aliphatic hydroxylation of the methyl benzimidazole moiety. The alcohol 
M10 was further oxidized to the corresponding acid M21. 
4) Hydroxylation of daridorexant at the anisole ring yielded M11, which underwent further glucuronidation to 
produce M6. 
5)  Hydroxylation  of  the  anisolyl  triazole  moiety  followed  by  glucuronidation  resulted  in  metabolite  M8.  The 
primary biotransformation product of this pathway was not detected. 
6)  Double  hydroxylation  on  the  triazole  ring  followed  by  glucuronidation  produced  M14.  The  primary 
biotransformation products of this pathway were not detected. 
7) Hydroxylation of the methylpyrrolidinyl benzimidazole moiety and subsequent glucuronidation led to M29. 
Further oxidation resulted in metabolite M18. 
Beyond daridorexant, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M9, M10 and M30 were observed in human plasma. Metabolites 
M1-M10 were identified from human hepatocytes. M11, M12, M13, M14, M17, M18, M20, M21, M22, M29 and 
M31 were structurally characterized in rat bile and faeces samples.

Rat shared with human, M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8, M9 and M10, thus supporting appropriateness of this specie 
for  toxicology  studies.  Among  the  non-rodent  species,  dog  showed  the  best  coverage  with  9/10  human 
metabolites and is best suited non-rodent species for toxicity  testing.  There  were species differences  in the 
rate of Daridorxant metabolism in liver microsomes. Under initial rate conditions, i.e. during the first 10min of 
incubation, Daridorexant turnover was only 19 % with human liver microsomes and thus the slowest among 
all species studied here. Little differences were observed between rat, dog, monkey and rabbit with turnover 
in the range of 29-45 %. Metabolism was fastest in the mouse with a 45% turnover in only 5min. 
Rat hepatocytes yielded 14 metabolites, with M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8, M9 and M10 also generated in human 
hepatocytes. Dog hepatocytes produced 8 metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M9 and M10) that were also 
found in humans. As for microsomes, there were species differences in the rate of Daridorexant metabolism, 
leading  to  21-34%  differences  in  turnover  1h.  The  fastest  metabolism  was  for  mouse  hepatocytes  as  70% 
turnover was reached (only 1h). 
Sex differences in the metabolic pattern of Daridorexant were investigated in the rat liver microsomes. There 
was no difference  in the nature of metabolic products between male and female rats. However, the rate of 
metabolite formation was 2-3 times slower with liver microsomes of female rats, as Daridorexant turnover was 
only  12  %  after  10  min  compared  to  29  %  with  liver  microsomes  from  male  animals.  Sex  differences  in 
metabolic competence is a well-known phenomenon in the rat and generally of no relevance for man. Similarly 
to liver microsomes, sex differences were evident in experiments with hepatocytes from male and female rats. 
Turnover was higher with liver cells from male rats with 71% turnover after 4h versus 42% in female. 
Based  on  enzyme  kinetic  analysis  of  Daridorexant  with  human  liver  microsomes  and  recombinant  P450 
enzymes,  CYP3A4  was  the  major  enzyme  responsible  for  daridorexant  metabolism  accounting  for  89%  of 
metabolic clearance.  
Excretion 
Excretion  pathways  were  deducted  from  QWBA  study  in  rats,  in  which  Daridorexant-derived  radioactivity 
remained important in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract up to 72h, and up to 24h in the kidney pyramid 
and urinary bladder. This supports the usual gastrointestinal tract transit times after an oral administration, 
with subsequent renal and biliary elimination.  Additional characterization comes from the metabolic profiling 
study in bile duct cannulated Wistar rats: excretion  of  radioactivity was fast with almost complete recovery 
achieved  within  24h  after  oral  14C-Daridorexant  (>90%),  and  within  4h  after  intravenous  administrations 
(>77%). The radioactivity recovered from bile (87%), urine (2%) and feces (1%) upon oral absorption.  
Irrespective of the route of administration, biliary secretion was the main excretion pathway whereas the role 
of renal excretion was negligible. Unchanged parent drug represented less than 1 % of the dose. Small amounts 
of radioactivity were found in faeces after intravenous dosing, indicating a minor degree of direct secretion of 
drug-related material from blood into the gastro-intestinal lumen. Daridorexant was extensively metabolized 
into  23  metabolites.  Eighteen  metabolites  were  observed  in  rat  bile,  of  which  M6  and  M9  were  the  main 
products, both being glucuronides of the primary metabolites M11 and M4. Five metabolites were observed in 
rat urine, none exceeding 0.3% of dose.  Daridorexant, M1,  M2, M3,  M5  and M13  were  the most prominent 
entities observed in plasma and were also detected in the brain. M1 that derived from M3 was not found in 
urine, faeces or bile. 
In lactating female rats Wistar following a single oral gavage administration at 30 mg/kg, Daridorexant and the 
3 major human metabolites were excreted wihin the first two hours into milk. Daridorexant, concentrations in

milk exceeded those in plasma by 14- to -20-fold while milk plasma ratios of the metabolites did not exceed 
1.6-fold.   
Inhibition, induction and drug-drug interactions  
Nonclinical data may support that daridorexant is not a substrate of OATP uptake transporters and the efflux 
pumps  P-gp/MDR-1  or  BCRP,  no  in  vivo  DDI  study  evaluating  the  effects  of  inhibitors/inducers  of  these 
transporters on daridorexant was conducted. Metabolites were demonstrated as possible in vitro substrates for 
PgP, but considering their low unbound peak plasma concentrations, they would not affect the disposition of 
concomitant drugs whose disposition is drug transporter‑dependent.  
The drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of daridorexant was investigated in vitro toward CYP450 enzymes 
and drug transport proteins (human liver microsomes,  recombinant P450 enzymes, and cellular systems or 
membrane vesicles overexpressing human transport proteins). CYP450 induction was investigated on the level 
of PXR activation and upregulation of CYP mRNA in human hepatocytes. 
Daridorexant  (and  to  a  smaller  extent,  M1  and  M3)  mainly  inhibited  CYP3A4,  and  showed  time-dependent 
inhibition  of  CYP3A4.  The  clinical  relevance  of  in  vitro  findings  was  assessed  clinically  with  midazolam  and 
rosuvastatin, and the study demonstrated Daridorexant is neither a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer, nor an inhibitor 
of BCRP.  Daridorexant  also inhibited  in vitro  a number of drug  transport proteins,  in particular BCRP, P-gp, 
MATE2K and MATE1. The clinical relevance of putative victim or perpetrator potency was investigated through 
a physiology-based pharmacokinetic modelling-based predictions of DDI (see clinical assessment report). The 
conclusion for the clinical doses in this model are: (i) Daridorexant may be a victim of CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers; (ii) Daridorexant may be a weak CYP3A4 inducer at clinical doses.  
However, based on interpretation of results in line with the EMA Guideline, in vivo inhibition of P-gp cannot be 
also completely excluded. Clinical relevance of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibition as well as whether daridorexant 
can be transported or not by the OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp and BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations, and 
data regarding inhibition of the BSEP transporter were discussed at clinical level for convenient interpretation 
with regard to clinical exposure. 
Daridorexant  activated  human  PXR  that  resulted  in  CYP3A4  mRNA  expression  upregulaton  in  human 
hepatocytes. In addition Daridorexant exposure after multiple dosing in the rat and in the dog resulted in a 
dose-dependent upregulation of  rat cyp3a1 and dog cyp3a12 mRNA in the livers, as well as rat ugt1a1 and 
ugt1a6  mRNA.  Then  Daridorexant  has  a  potential  for  induction  of  Drug  Metabolizing  Enzymes,  in  line  with 
known cyp3a and ugt enzymes regulation via the nuclear PXR. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Rats and dogs are pharmacologically species relevant for daridorexant, as the orexin system is highly conserved 
across mammalian species, and as activity on sleep parameters had been clearly demonstrated. Additionally 
Daridorexant crossed the brain of rats during pharmacology studies, leading to significant brain/plasma ratios 
support the activity. Major human metabolites were found in the plasma of rats and dogs

The multiple of exposure for the parent compound and M1, M3 and M10 major human metabolites calculated 
as the ratio of free Cmax and free AUC in male and female rats and dogs at NO(A)ELs versus plasma exposure 
in humans at 50 mg/day showed high safety margins for Daridorexant, M1, M3, and M10. Margins appeared 
higher  in  females  than  males  of  both  species.  The  lowest  margin  of  safety  relative  to  human  maximum 
recommended dose was established at 14/40- (M/F) and 18/50-fold in dogs, 72/121-, and 80/152-fold in rats 
for free AUC and Cmax, respectively. The lowest exposure ratio for free AUC and free Cmax of M1, M3 and M10 
are more than 147-, 238- and 73- fold at least for rats. These exposure ratio are more than 19-, 8.4- and 45- 
fold for M1, M3 and M10 in dogs. Theses margins may be sufficient to derisk non-clinical findings in the 26-
week and 39-week repeat dose studies and limit their translation to humans. 
In rats 
Daily administration of Daridorexant for 26 weeks (with 8-week recovery period) resulted in central nervous 
system at all dose levels associated to exacerbated pharmacology at supra-pharmacological doses or related 
to  the  sleep-promoting  effect  of  Daridorexant  at  pharmacological  doses.  Hypersalivation  at  all  doses  is 
considered related to poor oral palatability of the formulation. Other findings are reversible then toxicological 
significance  is  considered  low  (changes  in  hematology  parameters,  body  weight  gain,  increase  in  gamma 
glutamyl transferase, triglycerides, cholesterol). In addition the increase of plasma cholesterol, interpreted as 
related to drug-metabolizing enzymes induction and activation of human PXR by Daridorexant was not observed 
in humans with insomnia treated with daridorexant in clinical studies 
Reversible microscopic findings in the liver and in the thyroid gland occurred at doses ≥ 50mg/kg/day and can 
be  considered  non-adverse  as  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  is  commonly  considered  as  an  adaptation 
phenomenon in rodents and non-rodents and the hypertrophy of thyroid follicular cells could be secondary to 
hepatocellular hypertrophy. Regarding the  liver findings, there was no evidence of effect of  daridorexant on 
hepatic function in humans, no marked laboratory abnormalities were reported, and all hepatic TEAEs  were 
non-serious,  considered  not  medically  relevant  and  none  led  to  study  treatment  discontinuation.  The  liver 
findings correlated with the changes in clinical chemistry (increased gamma glutamyl transferase, decreased 
T4 levels)) and the follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid gland correlated with variations in thyroid hormone 
levels (slight increase in circulating TSH levels). Findings related to thyroid and hormones (and importantly, 
cell hypertrophy of the pars distalis in the anterior pituitary gland at 1000mg/kg in a 4-week study) may have 
no clinical relevance due to species differences in thyroid hormone transport, metabolism, and elimination, with 
rats  and  dogs  being  more  sensitive  than  humans  to  thyroid  changes  and  alterations  of  the  hypothalamo-
pituitary-thyroid  axis.  Follicular  cell  hypertrophy  of  the  thyroid  gland  in  rats  often  results  from  its 
overstimulation due to increased TSH production in the pituitary gland, which is a compensatory reaction to 
increased  metabolic  clearance  of  thyroid  hormones  through  ugt2b  enzyme  induction.  Based  on  the  clinical 
review of both thyrotropin abnormalities and AE pertaining to thyroid dysfunction during clinical trials, only AE 
attributable to the subjects’ medical history and/or thyrotropin levels already elevated at baseline were found. 
No  relationship  with  daridorexant  treatment  was  suggested,  and no dose-dependent  signal  was  detected  in 
these patients. 
The  kidney  findings  in  females  at  450  mg/kg/day  (increased  formation  of  tubular  hyaline  casts)  were  still 
present at the end of the treatment-free period, but considered non-adverse as such lesions are representative 
of  chronic  progressive  nephropathy  that  is  a  common  lesions  in  the  aging  rat,  and  do  not  correlate  with 
nephrotoxicity or renal injuries in humans. Then NOAEL can be established at 450 mg/kg/day, leading to safety 
margins relative to human maximum recommended dose at 72/121- and 80/152-fold in rats for free AUC and 
Cmax, respectively. Free AUC and Cmax for M1, M3 and M10 are also superior to free exposure in humans at 
50 mg/day. The lowest exposure ratio for free AUC and free Cmax of M1, M3 and M10 are more than 147-, 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 23/141 
 
 
 
238- and 73- fold at least for rats compared to the human clinical exposure. These data suggest low safety 
concern for non-reversible findings.  
If findings similar to those in the 26-week study were found in the 13-week GLP toxicity study (followed by a 
4-week treatment-free period) and in shorter studies (3 days to one month) with higher maximal dose, the 
administration of 1000 mg/kg/day led to deaths distended abdomen, severe hypothermia resulting in severe 
hypoactivity and bradycardia that likely contributed to death at high dose in rats (see mechanistic studies). 
Finally on the possible relationship between orexin receptor antagonism at very high doses and death related 
to gastrointestinal dysfunction and hypothermia, this is not considered clinically relevant as findings occurred 
at free Cmax largely exceeding free human exposure at clinical dose of 50mg/day. 
In dogs 
In  Beagle  dogs  were  administered  10,  30,  or  100mg/kg/day  Daridorexant  for  39  consecutive  weeks,  and 
followed by 8 weeks of recovery period, there were no test item-related deaths and no daridorexant-related 
clinical signs at 10mg/kg/day.  
The CNS-related clinical findings consisted mainly to exaggerated pharmacology-driven effects as  decubitus, 
lying down, loss of balance, unsteady gait, clumsy movements, unable to stand and/or immobility. They were 
observed in the exercise area after positive stimulation, approximately 1-2 h after dosing from Week 7 for the 
majority of animals given 100 mg/kg/day and for a few animals given 30mg/kg/day. While they were no more 
observed from the beginning of the recovery period, these clinical signs can be considered as adverse due to 
their  severity.  Hypersalivation,  and  a  higher  incidence  of  vomiting  and/or  regurgitation  occurred  at  100 
mg/kg/day for both sexes that were probably related to the poor palatability of the formulation. Daridorexant 
lowered food consumption for males given 100 mg/kg/day, without impacting body weight. These findings were 
considered non-adverse since there was no impact on the global health condition of the dogs. 
Daridorexant  related  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  parameters  consisted  mainly  of  increased  alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day and decreased albumin concentration and in total bilirubin 
concentrations in both sexes at 100 mg/kg/day.  These  variations were no longer present at  the end of the 
treatment-free period and were considered as non-adverse. One female treated at 100 mg/kg/day had high 
ALT,  GLDH,  AST  and  GGT  activities  without  histological  features.  These  changes  were  reversible,  then 
considered non-adverse. There were no Daridorexant-related changes at the low dose level of 10 mg/kg/day. 
Absolute and relative liver weight increased up to 100 mg/kg/day in both sexes, without histologic evidence of 
hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  Following  the  treatment-free  period,  changes  fully  reversed.  There  were  no 
histological changes at 10 mg/kg/day. It was shown in a non-GLP morphometry study, that the liver weight 
increase was due to a moderate and homogeneous enlargement of hepatocytes probably secondary to drug 
metabolizing enzymes induction (see mechanistic studies). At clinical level, there was no evidence of any effect 
of daridorexant treatment on hepatic function in humans. 
A slight increase in presence of adipocytes in the sternal bone marrow was observed in males and females at 
100mg/kg/day, and was considered non-adverse due to reversibility during the treatment-free period.  
Increased amount of luminal secretory material in the gallbladder of females at 30 mg/kg/day, and males and 
females at 100 mg/kg/day. As no gallstone developed, and no histological alteration of the gallbladder occurred 
at any dose  level and time, and finding were  reversible at recovery, observed functional excretory changes 
may  be  considered  not  adverse  and  unlikely  to  translate  in  humans  at  50  mg/day  clinical  dose  (exposures 
multiple around 134-and 780-fold in females and males, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 24/141 
 
 
 
 
Finally  the  NOEL  was  established  at  10  mg/kg/day  in  both  sexes,  corresponding  to  a  test  item  AUClast  of 
5180/6410 ng.h/mL (male/female) on Day 1 and 9100/17500 ng.h/mL (male/female) in Week 39. The multiple 
of exposure for the parent compound and M1, M3 and M10 major human metabolites calculated as the ratio of 
free Cmax and free AUC in male and female dogs at NOEL versus plasma exposure in humans at 50 mg/day 
showed  high  safety  margins  for  ACT-541468,  M1,  M3,  and  M10:  the  margin  of  safety  relative  to  human 
maximum recommended dose was established at 14/40-(male/female) and 18/50-fold for free AUC and Cmax, 
respectively. The lowest exposure ratio for free AUC and free Cmax of M1, M3 and M10 are more than 19-, 
8.4- and 45- fold. Theses margins may be sufficient to derisk non-clinical findings and limit their translation to 
humans. 
2.5.4.2.  Genotoxicity 
Usual battery of in vitro and in vivo GLP compliant-tests in line with ICH S2 guidelines were performed to assess 
the  genotoxic  potential  based  on  in  vitro  gene  mutations  test,  chromosomal  aberrations  test  in  human 
lymphocytes, as well as the micronucleus assay in bone marrow cells from rats treated Daridorexant. In vitro 
tests  were  performed  also  under  metabolic  activation  or  not,  using  appropriate  concentration  range  and 
maximal  concentration,  and  with  sufficient  replicates/counts  in  appropriate  cell/strains  systems.  S9  fraction 
was from a specie from which metabolism was demonstrated in ADME studies. In contrast to positive controls, 
Daridorexant  was  considered  to  be  non-clastogenic  in  this  chromosome  aberration  test,  when  tested  up  to 
cytotoxic and/or precipitating concentrations (52.2 μg/mL), and non-mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium 
reverse mutation assay up to 5000 μg/plate, neither in the presence nor absence of S9 metabolic activation. 
Regarding in vivo study, plasma concentrations in animals dosed with Daridorexant at 2000 mg/kg b.w. ranged 
from 4.70 to 12.5μg/mL that is at least 47-fold higher than human exposure at clinical dose considering free 
Cmax. These animals exhibited a reduction of spontaneous activity without statistically significant increase of 
micronucleus  frequency,  in  contrast  to  cyclophosphamide.  By  extension  M1,  M3  and  M10  metabolites  are 
intrinsically considered to not display genotoxic potential as metabolites were generated in this study at levels 
superior to human exposure with plasma concentrations of 53-, 11- and 19-fold respectively relative to human 
free Cmax at the 50mg clinical dose.  
2.5.4.3.  Carcinogenicity 
A slightly higher body weight gain was seen in males treated  Daridorexant at 150mg/kg/day, and weight of 
the liver increased up to +26% and +42% in males and females, respectively. Weight of the thyroid glands 
also  increased  up  to  +43%  in  males  and  +23%  in  females.  Marked  thyrotropin  abnormalities  and  thyroid 
dysfunction were found in clinical trials only in subjects with medical history and/or thyrotropin levels already 
elevated at baseline. Then thyroid changes in rats can be considered not clinically relevant.  
Non-neoplastic  findings  were  observed  in  females  treated  at  150mg/kg/day  and  consisted  of  increased 
incidence  and/or  severity  of  bile  duct  hyperplasia,  karyocytomegaly  /  multinucleated  hepatocytes,  and 
centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy in the liver. These effects were detected also in the pivotal 6-month 
repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. An increased incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy was observed. 
Chronic progressive nephropathy is a common lesions in the aging rat, and literature may suggest that such 
nephropathy in rats may not lead to nephrotoxicity or renal injury in humans. Finally the results in patients 
without and with severe renal impairment showed that daridorexant can be administered to subjects with any 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022

degree  of  renal  function  impairment  without  the  need  for  dose  adjustment.  Then  findings  in  rats  are  not 
clinically relevant.  
There  were  no  Daridorexant-related  effects  on  the  incidence  of  pre-neoplastic  and  neoplastic  microscopic 
findings. Masses were primarily located in the thoracic and ventral/dorsal abdominal regions and to a lower 
extent in the urogenital region. The neoplastic findings were considered unrelated to Daridorexant and within 
the spectrum of the spontaneous histopathological variation in this species in view of their nature and incidence. 
The number of adenomas of pars distalis and follicular adenomas in the thyroid gland in males treated at 150 
mg/kg/day  was  higher  than  in  the  control  groups,  but  without  statistical  significance  upon  Peto  analysis  of 
tumor incidences. In the pathology report,  higher incidence of cysts was reported in the ovaries of females 
treated at 150mg/kg/day. The ovarian cysts were generally focal and unilateral and were considered likely part 
of the spontaneous histopathological background variation in aging female rats based on litterature review. To 
conclude, daily administration of ACT-541468A by once daily oral gavage to the Wistar rat up to 150mg/kg/day 
for  104  weeks  did  not  induce  significant  neoplastic changes.  Given  the  safety  margins,  there  are  no  safety 
concern. 
The 26-week carcinogenicity assay in Tg.rasH2 mice daily administered by oral gavage with t 100, 200/300 
(females/males) or 1000 mg/kg/day of Daridorexant was conducted according to ICHS1 under GLPs. Selection 
of  high  dose  for  carcinogenicity  study  should  be  50-fold  ratio  (AUC)  in  TgrasH2  mice  according  to  ICHS1, 
however the multiple of exposure ratio for the 1000 mg/kg high dose are only 8.5-4.37 fold (males-females) 
for Daridorexant, and comprised between 5.3 and 7.7 fold for metabolites. This high dose may be accepted 
considering possible limiting toxicity for a 26-week treatment duration based on liver necrosis from the 4 week-
DRF  study  at  1500  mg/kg/day.  Oral  administration  of  Daridorexant  resulted  in  minor  test-article  related 
decreased body weights and body weight gain in males at ≥300 mg/kg/day and non-neoplastic findings limited 
to  increased  liver  weights  in  males  at  ≥300mg/kg/day  and  females  at  1000  mg/kg/day  and  corresponding 
hepatocellular hypertrophy in males at ≥ 100mg/kg/day and females at 1000 mg/kg/day. This hepatocellular 
hypertrophy, also occurring in other GLP toxicity studies, was considered to be an adaptive and non-adverse 
change. All these findings were known from other pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents. There was a 
lack of a dose response in the incidence of non-neoplastic findings. N-Nitroso-N-methylurea, as positive control 
resulted in induction of neosplastic lesions to validate the study.  Daridorexant did not induce any significant 
neoplastic changes and therefore was considered not carcinogenic. 
2.5.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility studies were conducted in male rats mated to untreated female rats at oral doses up to 450 mg/kg/day, 
and in female rats mated to untreated male rats at oral doses  up to 300 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related 
adverse effect was observed on male mating behaviour and fertility, reproductive organ weights and sperm 
parameters at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day. In females, there was no treatment related effect on estrous cycle, 
mating  behaviour  and  reproductive  indices.  However,  the  number  of  implantations  was  decreased  at  300 
mg/kg, causing reductions in the number of live embryos and in gravid uterine weight and an increase in the 
pre-implantation loss. The NOAEL for male and female reproduction is therefore set at 450 mg/kg/day and 100 
mg/kg/day, respectively, corresponding to safety margins of >30 based on free AUC levels suggesting that 
effects seen in females are of minor concern for clinical use. 
Embryo-fetal development toxicity studies  were  conducted in rats and rabbits. Treatment-related effects on 
embryo-foetal survival or foetal malformations were not reported in any species. A decrease in fetal weight 
was seen in rabbits at 88-fold the clinical exposure (based on free AUC levels) and would therefore be of minor 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 26/141 
 
 
 
 
concern for clinical use. At the developmental NOAELs of 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 60 mg/kg/day in rabbits, 
safety margins were ≥46 based on free AUC levels.  
In  the  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study,  there  was  no  treatment-related  effect  on  post‑weaning 
development of F1 rats including sexual maturation, behavioral tests, and mating performance and fertility at 
doses inducing exposure levels 123-fold higher than those reached in patients. (based on free AUC levels) The 
body  weight  of  F1  animals  at  the  high  dose  level  of  300  mg/kg  was  lower  than  that  of  controls  from  birth 
(males: -4.6%; females: -5.33%) to weaning (males: -7.5%; females: -6.54%). In males, this effect persisted 
during the postweaning period up to termination on PND98 (-4.5%), whereas it reversed between PND56 and 
PND77 in females. The changes were considered as non-adverse notably since the reported values lied within 
the historical control range, and because there was no consequence on the animals’ clinical condition and sexual 
maturation. 
Juvenile toxicity 
Although the current application is for adult patients, a 9-week juvenile toxicity study was conducted in rats 
aged  21  days  dosed  orally  at  0,  50,  150  and  450  mg/kg/day  to  further  support  development  in  paediatric 
patients from 2 years of age. To resume, the non-adversity of increased motor activity noted at ≥150 mg/kg 
had been discussed further, since the data point to a treatment-relationship in all treated groups. Moreover, 
the treatment-relationship of the increased incidence and severity of interstitial cell vacuolation in the ovary 
observed in treated animals. Otherwise, thyroid and liver findings reported in this study were in line with those 
seen in studies initiated in sexually mature animals. 
Motor activity: the applicant relies on the variability of motor activity measures which may be caused by non-
treatment-related  factors  (time  of  the  day,  state  of  wakefulness,  age,  level  of  anxiety,  etc.).  This  is 
acknowledged.  However  in  the  context  of  the  juvenile  animal  study  (JAS),  such  inter-individual  sources  of 
variability  should  have  been  limited  between  control  and  treated  animals.  Historical  data  were  provided, 
showing notably that motor activity measures for high dosed males were outside of the historical control range 
for both basic (4532 vs. 1660-4094) and fine (3659 vs. 1343-3255) movements. At the mid dose level, the 
reported motor activity for males were within the highest historical control range (basic: 4136; fine: 3283). 
Therefore, a treatment-related effect cannot be excluded at the high dose level. Nevertheless, the unchanged 
pattern of overall motor activity as well as the reversibility of the reported findings are noted. In addition, since 
they were observed at a high exposure ratio (x85 clinical exposure) with sufficient safety margin (x29), it can 
be concluded that the clinical relevance is most likely remote. Inclusion in the SPC 5.3 is therefore not needed 
at this stage. 
Histopathological findings in ovaries: interstitial cell vacuolation is reported as having been over-diagnosed in 
the current study due notably to technical (location of histological cut) and biological (stage of estrous cycle) 
factors. However, historical control data indicate that interstitial cell vacuolation was reported in none of 19 
JAS conducted for the past 5 years at the CRO where the current JAS study was performed. Since procedures 
applied in a given facility are expected to be similar from a study to another, over-diagnosis of a particular 
finding in a single study would not be expected. 
In the definitive JAS study, the incidence of interstitial cell vacuolation in ovaries at end of treatment was 1/10, 
4/10, 6/10, and 9/10 (10%, 40%, 60%, and 90%) in the control, low, mid, and high dose groups. At the end 
of recovery, these values were 4/6, 1/6, 2/5, and 3/6 (66%, 17%, 40%, and 50%). Therefore, it is considered 
that the incidence of this lesion was in the study control range (10-66%) in all groups, except in high-dosed 
females at end of treatment. Similarly, the severity of the lesion was in general similar in the control, low and

mid dose groups (minimal) and increased at the high dose level at the end of treatment (minimal to mild). 
Therefore, the NOAEL for this ovary finding could be set at the mid dose level of 150 mg/kg/day, from which a 
safety margin of x29 can be derived based on unbound AUC levels. The histopathological finding noted at 450 
mg/kg/day had no functional correlate since there was no treatment-related effect on estrous cycles, mating 
performance, and fertility. Considering the high exposure ratio at this dose level (x85), and the other nonclinical 
data  in  adult  rats  showing  no  drug-related  effect  on  ovaries,  estrous  cycle,  fertility,  and  tissues  with  high 
expression of orexin receptors, it is considered that the clinical relevance of this effect is most likely remote 
and therefore does not require to be included in the SPC 5.3. 
2.5.4.5.  Toxicokinetic data 
Interspecies comparison of the exposure profiles showed tendency to similar shape for the parent and major 
metabolites upon chronic treatment with dose dependent exposure levels and with significant less than dose 
proportionality in the range of higher doses. A tendency for less-than-dose-proportional increase in exposures 
was observed in non-clinical species in the range of lowest-moderate doses and could be interpreted as related 
to saturation of first-pass metabolism that may result in full saturation of first-pass metabolism when doses 
increase. Interestingly, exposure ratios between daridorexant and the sum of metabolites (M1, M3, M1 changed 
slightly  in  favour  of  the  parent,  supporting  occurrence  of  metabolism  saturation  when  Daridorexant  doses 
increase. 
Daridorexant, M1, M3, and M10 circulate in plasma of these species and cover human exposure at all doses 
equal  to  or  greater  than  human  exposure  levels,  excepted  for  mice  for  with  exposure  level  are  the  lower 
relatively  to  other  species.  A  plausible  explanation  for  the  lower  exposure  level  in  mice  compared  to  other 
species may be that the main metabolic pathways are significantly different in mice which generated rather M4 
and M9 than M1, M3, and M10, then changing exposure daridorexant: metabolite in favour to metabolites.  
Daridorexant  may  slightly  accumulated  between  administrations  in  all  species.  Auto-induction  of  CYP450 
enzymes  may  be  responsible  for  such  phenomenon  as  upregulation  of  cyp2b1/2  and  cyp3a1  had  been 
demonstrated in liver, at least in rats and dogs, but this slight accumulation may traduce also a saturation of 
clearance processes. 
Exposure  at  the  lowest-moderate  doses  for  both  parent  and  metabolites  generally  led  generally  to  higher 
exposure in females compared to males in dogs, whereas exposure in mice and rat females was generally the 
higher than in males whatever the dose. This gender effect was more characterized in dogs and rats for which 
the sex difference rarely exceeded 2-fold for ACT-541468. As ACT-541468 is primary metabolized by CYP450 
enzymes, this gender difference  may be explained at  least by known  sexual dimorphism (in rats and dogs) 
regarding the phase I metabolism pathway. 
Mechanistic studies  
Mechanistic studies for liver findings were conducted given the hepatotoxicity findings toxicity studies in mice, 
rats and dogs (exploratory and definitive repeat-dose toxicity studies, including carcinogenicity programme). 
A non-GLP study aimed at investigating the direct cytotoxic potency of daridorexant in primary-cultured CD-1 
mouse and human hepatocytes through the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay demonstrated Daridorexant 
had  no  direct  cytotoxic  potential  up  to  50  μM,  corresponding  to  a  22/7500-fold  the  total/free  plasma 
concentrations at the clinical dose of 50 mg/day. Then it is considered  daridorexant is not directly cytotoxic 
against hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposure.

2.5.4.6.  Other toxicity studies 
Dependence potential 
Because Daridorexant is a centrally penetrant, CNS-active drug, the potential risk of abuse was evaluated in 
non-clinical  studies.  On  one  hand,  Daridorexant  treatment  was  associated  with  signs  of  sedation  in 
pharmacology and toxicology studies. On the other hand, Daridorexant did not displayed a novel mechanism 
of action as two DORAs are presently marketed, but the background on the class may be considered low that 
supports the need of drug abuse and liability studies for Daridorexant at non clinical level. As a complement, 
off-target profiling included CNS targets known to be associated with substance abuse, including cannabinoid 
receptors, opioid receptors, serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, monoamine transporters, glutamate NMDA 
receptors,  and  various  ion  channels.  Data  from  human  receptor-ligand  binding  assays  related  to  neuronal 
systems evidenced some agonism or antagonism of the parent or M1 metabolite for : angiotensin II receptor 
type  1,  adrenergic  β3  receptor,  human  tachykinin  receptor  3,  opiate  OP2  receptor,  and  human  dopamine 
transporter, that may be related to abuse. Given IC50 and clinical exposure, off-target effects of Daridorexant 
and metabolites are considered to not activate any abuse-related molecular CNS targets at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  Then  the  Applicant’  strategy  was  to  investigate  Drug  Discrimination  studies  followed  by 
behavioural  assessment  of  dependence  through  the  withdrawal  syndrome  and  self-administration  test.  The 
plasma exposure reached during these experimental procedures were within the concentration range known to 
cause inhibition of orexin receptor signalling in the brain and to decrease wakefulness in rats, and compatible 
with the target exposure in humans at clinical dose of 50 mg. The level of M1, M3 and M10 in plasma was also 
compatible  with  the  clinical  exposure  in  humans.  In  the  three  GLP-compliant  abuse  liability  studies, 
daridorexant  had  no  potential  for  self-administration  in  rats  with  a  previous  history  of  cocaine  self-
administration and did not generalize to the effects of zolpidem in rats trained to discriminate zolpidem from 
placebo.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  changes  in  physiological,  neurobehavioral,  or  locomotor  activity 
parameters associated with the withdrawal syndrome after treatment discontinuation in rats. Taken together, 
based on animal studies, daridorexant did not reveal any sign indicative of physical dependence or drug abuse 
potential.  
Metabolites 
The safety profiles of major human metabolites (M1, M3 and M10) were obtained from pivotal oral toxicology 
studies with daradorixant wherein metabolites exposures were equal or greater to the human clinical exposure 
at 50 mg/day. Each major  metabolite was detected  at  least 50% of human exposure at the 50 mg dose in 
multiple species, consistent with ICHM3 (R2, Q&A, 2012). 
Impurities 
The  assessment  of  genotoxic  impurities  is  consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  ICH  M7.  All  potential, 
confirmed  or  known  mutagenic  impurities  in  the  final  substance  are  below  the  thresholds  of  toxicological 
concern, below the limit of detection in batches, or estimated as negligible amount due to large purge factors. 
Regarding non mutagenic impurities, specifications were extrapolated from oral GLP-repeat dose toxicological 
studies with batches of Daridorexant hydrochloride containing sufficient amount of impurities. Then all relevant 
impurities were qualified in vivo according to ICHM3/S3 guidelines, and the Applicant proposed specifications 
below the qualification thresholds. No safety concern is anticipated. 
Phototoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 29/141 
 
 
 
 
Daridorexant is not of concern for phototoxicity as (i) it did not display any phototoxic effects on BALB/c 3T3 
cells  under  the  experimental  conditions  compliant  with  ICHS10;  (ii)  there  were  no  significant  evidence  of 
binding to melanin based on tissue distribution studies in pigmented versus albino rats. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Log  octanol-water  partition  coefficient  was  experimentally  determined  below  the  trigger  value  of  4.5  at 
environmentally relevant pH’s, then daridorexant is not considered to be a persistent (P) and bioaccumulative 
substance, or a very (T) and very ‘B) substance. But based the active substance should be considered vP (due 
to persistence in sediment according to OECD 308), not B and not T. PECSW was determined above the action 
limit of 0.01 μg/L (0.25 μg free base/L), then a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was conducted 
by  the  Applicant  with  a  total  residue  approach  to  cover  environmental  fate  and  toxicity  of  metabolites  and 
parent compound. During Phase  II assessment,  shifting to the sediment in the water-sediment degradation 
test was observed. Risk assessments for the surface water, sediment and sewage treatment plant allowed to 
conclude  that  daridorexant  (and  metabolites)  do  not  represent  a  risk  for  the  aquatic  environment,  the 
groundwater, soil and sediment compartments, micororganisms, plants and biota.

The main toxicology, toxicokinetic, and safety pharmacology studies were performed in accordance with Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and were conducted in countries that are signatories to the Organization 
for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  mutual  acceptance  of  data  (MAD)  agreement  and  at 
laboratories  that  are  members  of  their  national  GLP  compliance  programme.  Other  pharmacodynamic  and

pharmacokinetic  studies  do  not  fall  under  these  regulations.  Applicable  International  Conference  for 
Harmonisation  (ICH),  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP),  or  Food  and  Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  guidance  documents  were  also  referenced  during  the  design  of  the  toxicology, 
toxicokinetic,  and  safety  pharmacology  studies.  When  deviations  to  protocols  were  identified,  they  were 
considered to have no or minimal impact on study outcomes.  
Proof-of-concept for the indication was sufficiently demonstrated in in vivo primary pharmacology studies using 
as usually naive rats and dogs as models. Daridorexant exerted its activity from the brain at clinically achievable 
concentration. Selective antagonism on OX1 and OX2 receptors was the primary mode of action on OX1 and 
OX2 receptors from in vitro calcium mobilization studies.  Daridorexant behaved very similarly the approved 
drug Suvorexant, with similar range of Kb and apparent occupancy half-life on human OX1 receptor and OX2 
receptor. It can be concluded that daridorexant induced surmountable and rapid sleep-wake effects, the overall 
non-REM and REM sleep times being increased without the wake period did not exceed the natural sleep period, 
without next-day residual effect, as animals can be awakened and able to perform normally in various motor 
tasks. The 3 major human metabolites M1, M3 and M10 exhibited Kb values for human OX1/OX2 receptors 
several  order  greater  than  those  of  Daridorexant  supporting  metabolites  are  not  expected  to  significantly 
contribute  to  sleep  effect.  Such  dual  OX1  and  2  receptor  antagonism  would  therefore  promote  slow  sleep 
(NREM), and paradoxical sleep (REM) in insomniac humans.  
Secondary pharmacology investigation showed that Daridorexant, M1, M3, and M10 do not bind to or inhibit 
the activity of a large panel of target receptors, channels, and enzymes, and for the few observed in vitro off-
target, the large multiple of exposure at the clinical exposure at clinical dose, allow to consider off-target risk 
is not considered relevant for humans for daridorexant and its major human metabolites at clinical exposure. 
Findings from dedicated GLP- and ICH7-compliant safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs, and additional 
non-GLP  studies  in  guinea  pigs,  are  considered  of  low  concern  for translation in  humans  given  large  safety 
margins.  Daridorexant  (and  major  human  metabolites)  plasma  concentrations  well  covered  clinical  human 
exposure. No relevant adverse effects for human were observed on respiratory system, central nervous system, 
or cardiovascular function at Cmax values more than 50-fold above the human exposure at the 50mg/day dose. 
Data suggest also a low risk in hypertensive patients. Non-adverse reduction of activity and arousal occurred 
in rats and dogs as pharmacology-driven effects. Only severe hypothermia at highest dose occurred in animals, 
but any similar finding was reported in clinical studies. 
ADME studies demonstrated that daridorexant is rapidly orally absorbed, and distributed in all tissues, mainly 
in  the  gastrointestinal  mucosa,  the  liver  and  kidney,  adrenal  gland,  brown  fat,  and  myocardium.  The 
radioactivity decreased to the limit of quantification at 24h post dose in most tissues and blood except the liver 
and  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  no  remaining  radioactivity  was  detected  7  days  post-dose  in  any  tissue. 
Excretion routes were renal and biliary elimination. Exposure generally increased in a more than proportional 
manner with increasing oral doses but a significant first-pass extraction was observed, saturation of metabolic 
processes during oral absorption that might contribute to non-linear PK at highest dose. PK profiles in subjects 
with insomnia and healthy subjects showed that the exposure was approximately dose proportional up to the 
maximum  therapeutic  dose  of  50  mg  with  no  influence  of  sex  on  daridorexant  PK  parameters,  and  no 
accumulation, in contrast to non-clinical species, which slight accumulation or gender effect were observed. 
Daridorexant  is  highly  bound  to  plasma  of  human  subject  and  non-clinical  species,  and  with  no  significant 
variability within human plasma sample, allowing to calculate exposure ratio based in free Cmax and AUC. 
Daridorexant crosses the blood-brain barrier and local concentration had been correlated to sleep-promoting 
activity in rats.  Significant plasma binding properties were evinced among non-clinical species and humans,

exposure. The non-linear plasma binding manifests as dose-dependent increases in the volume of distribution 
at steady state and prolonged half-lives, as higher unbound plasma concentrations facilitate drug partitioning 
into tissues. This in a favour to achieve high exposure for free concentration of ACT-541468 on the toxicological 
species used in pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies (rat and dog). No significant differences in tissue distribution 
and elimination of radioactivity in pigmented versus albino rats suggesting ACT-541468A (or metabolites) is 
not able to bind to melanin and a low concern for risk associated to phototoxicity (the usual phototoxicity test 
in on BALB/c 3T3 was negative).  Major human metabolites were generated at sufficient level in non-clinical 
species. Phase I metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) as well UGTs were 
found to mediate the metabolism of Daridorexant, CYP3A4 being the major enzyme responsible for ACT-541468 
metabolism accounting for 89% of metabolic clearance. Then from the ADME and pharmacology point of view, 
the rat and dog can be then considered relevant species for non-clinical efficacy and safety studies. As a remark, 
the standard analytical methods used for the ADME programme are considered appropriate and validated for 
their purpose. However, long-term stability testing of daridorexant and its metabolites in rat and rabbit plasma 
will only be completed in June 2022. The applicant commits to provide the missing data once available. 
Based on experiments with human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 enzymes, CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers are expected to modify daridorexant pharmacokinetics in man. Daridorexant is an inhibitor of several 
P450 enzymes tested in vitro, the strongest effect was observed on CYP3A4.  Daridorexant was also a weak 
time-dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor. The clinical relevance of CYP3A4 inhibition was further investigated in vivo 
and/or through physiology-based pharmacokinetic modelling-based predictions. The inhibitory potential of the 
metabolites showed a similar pattern but was generally weaker compared to parent drug. In vitro studies were 
performed  to  investigate  whether  daridorexant  induces  enzymes,  daridorexant  upregulated  CYP3A4  mRNA 
expression  in  human  hepatocytes:  Daridorexant  and  its  metabolites  elicited  a  concentration-dependent 
activation of human PXR. Daridorexant has a potential for induction of Drug Metabolizing Enzymes, cyp3a and 
glucuronyltransferases  enzymes  regulation  via  the  nuclear  PXR.  These  observations  were  also  confirmed  in 
vivo. 
Nonclinical  data  also  suggested that  daridorexant  may  be  not  a  substrate  of OATP  uptake  transporters  and 
efflux  pumps  as  P-gp/MDR-1  or  BCRP.  Daridorexant  also  inhibited  a  number  of  drug  transport  proteins,  in 
particular BCRP, P-gp, MATE2K and MATE1. The clinical relevance of putative victim or perpetrator potency was 
investigated  through  a  physiology-based  pharmacokinetic  modelling-based  predictions  of  DDI  (see  clinical 
assessment report). The conclusion for the clinical doses in this model are: (i) Daridorexant may be a victim of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers; (ii) Daridorexant may be a weak CYP3A4 inducer at clinical doses.  
Relevance of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibition, inhibition of P-gp, inhibition of the BSEP transporter and whether 
daridorexant  can  be  transported,  or  not,  by  the  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  P-gp  and  BCRP  at  clinically  relevant 
concentrations,  were  discussed  in  the  clinical  section  for  convenient  interpretation  with  regard  to  clinical 
exposure. 
As  daridorexant  and  its  three  major  metabolites  were  detected  in  milk  of  lactating  rats,  information  about 
presence of Daridorexant and its metabolites in the milk of lactating rats is indicated in the SmPC 4.6 as there 
are no data about human breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. 
There was no available data about placental transfer.  
Daridorexant treatment induced in non-clinical species some effects at the level of  the central nervous system 
that are mainly related to the sleep-promoting activity of daridorexant around the pharmacological dose range, 
but also signs of exaggerated pharmacology at supra-pharmacological doses (toxicity studies have identified 
clinical signs of sudden muscle weakness, reminiscent of cataplexy, upon positive stimulation in dogs as the 
main  relevant  target-related  toxicity;  cataplexy  is  a  known  phenomenon  in  dogs  and  with  DORAs  given  to

animals in the morning and at high doses (Mahoney 2020, Mieda 2017)). These comprised lying down, partly 
closed eyes, slow breathing and reduced physical activity  in rats; and decubitus, lying down, loss of balance, 
unsteady gait, clumsy movements, unable to stand and/or immobility in dogs. Hypersalivation, vomiting and/or 
regurgitation may occur reflecting poor palatability of oral formulations. These clinical signs were not adverse 
and were reversible upon cessation of treatment, and microscopic examination of the brain did not reveal any 
drug related anomalies. Neurological evaluation and microscopic examination of the brain did not reveal any 
treatment-related  anomalies.  Based  on  the  high  safety  margins  of  ≥  45  to  human  exposure  at  50  mg/day, 
cataplexy is unlikely to occur in patients. 
Regarding the relationship between orexin receptor antagonism at very high doses in non-clinical species and 
death related to gastrointestinal dysfunction, severe hypothermia and cardiovascular impairment, this is not 
considered  clinically  relevant  as  findings  occurred  at  exposures  (Cmax  /  AUC0-24)  ≥  170/450-fold  the  free 
human exposure at clinical dose of 50mg/day. 
In fertility studies, no treatment-related adverse effect was observed on male rats  up to 450 mg/kg/day, and 
in females only the number of implantations was decreased at 300 mg/kg, causing reductions in the number 
of live embryos and in gravid uterine weight and an increase in the pre-implantation loss ( safety margins of 
>30 based on free AUCs). Decrease in fetal weight was seen in rabbits at 88-fold the clinical exposure (based 
on free AUC levels), with developmental NOAELs of 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 60 mg/kg/day in rabbits (≥46-
fold free human AUC). Given margins, these finding were not considered of concern in humans. In the pre- and 
post-natal development study, there was no treatment-related effect on post‑weaning development of F1 rats 
up to exposure levels 123-fold higher than those reached in patients (based on free AUC). The changes in body 
weight of F1 animals at the high dose level of 300 mg/kg were considered as non-adverse notably since the 
reported values lied within the historical control range, and because there was no consequence on the animals’ 
clinical condition and sexual maturation. 
Daridorexant  (and  major  human  metabolites)  were  not  considered  of  genotoxic  potential  based  on  in  vitro 
(negative  Ames  and  chromosomal  aberration  assays)  or  in  vivo  (no  induction  of  micronuclei  in  the 
polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow of rats up to free Cmax 47-fold higher than human exposure) 
studies conducting according to ICHS2 guideline. No carcinogen potential is expected in humans. 
Drug  Discrimination  studies  followed  by  behavioural  assessment  of  dependence  through  the  withdrawal 
syndrome and self-administration test were performed at plasma exposure compatible/superior to inhibition of 
orexin receptor and decrease wakefulness in rats, and target clinical exposure in humans. In the GLP-compliant 
studies, daridorexant had no potential for self-administration in rats with a previous history of cocaine self-
administration and did not generalize to the effects of zolpidem in rats trained to discriminate zolpidem from 
placebo.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  changes  in  physiological,  neurobehavioral,  or  locomotor  activity 
parameters associated with the withdrawal syndrome after treatment discontinuation in rats. Taken together, 
based on animal studies, daridorexant did not reveal any sign indicative of physical dependence or drug abuse 
potential. Taken together, based on animal studies, daridorexant did not reveal any sign indicative of physical 
dependence  or drug abuse potential. These  data  may  support a low  potential  for abuse  and  dependence in 
humans at 50mg Daridorexant. In humans at the therapeutic dose of 50 mg, a dose-dependent drug-liking 
effect was seen lower than those at supratherapeutic doses of suvorexant 150mg or zolpidem 30mg, but similar 
at  daridorexant  supratherapeutic  doses  of  100  and  150mg.  TEAEs  suggestive  of  euphoria  such  as  euphoric 
mood  and  feeling  abnormal  were  less  frequent  at  therapeutic  and  supratherapeutic  doses  of  daridorexant 
compared to suvorexant and zolpidem. In addition, daridorexant showed fewer perceptual alterations and less 
impairment of cognitive function compared to zolpidem (at all doses of daridorexant) and suvorexant (at 50mg

of daridorexant only). Such clinical pattern may support a lower abuse potential of daridorexant at the dose of 
50 mg compared to higher clinical doses of zolpidem and suvorexant. 
Impurities were qualified in vitro and in vivo consistently with the ICH M7/M3/S3 recommendations.  
Environmental risk assessment concluded that the prescribed usage of  daridorexant film-coated tablets is at 
low risk. One transformation product (M-1, identified as ACT-774170) was considered a major transformation 
product  during  the  water/sediment  (OECD  308  study)  and  the  structure  and  formula  were  reported  in  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment report, as this information might be relevant for water suppliers and monitoring 
issues. In addition the following statement had been added to section 6.6 of the SmPC: “Any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.” 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An extensive data package of non-clinical studies has been provided. The  primary pharmacodynamic studies 
provided adequate evidence that Daridorexant exerted its activity from the brain at clinically achievable 
concentration. Selective and insurmountable antagonism on OX1 and OX2 receptors was the primary mode of 
action on OX1 and OX2 receptors from in vitro studies. It can be concluded that Daridorexant induced 
surmountable and rapid sleep-wake effects, the overall non-REM and REM sleep times being increased 
without the wake period did not exceed the natural sleep period, without next-day residual effect, and as 
animals can be awakened and able to perform normally in various motor tasks.  
The safety programme provided adequate evidence that Daridorexant would not induced adverse effects in 
humans at clinical doses.  
Daridorexant does not represent a risk for environment.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The Applicant is asked to submit the final reports evaluating the long-term stability of daridorexant and its 
metabolites (ACT-776063, ACT776537 and ACT-1016-3307) in rat (BA-17.030) and rabbit (BA-18.023) 
plasma by June 2022.

The clinical pharmacologic program includes 18 completed Phase 1 studies, 3 Phase 2 and 2 Phase 3 studies. 
The following Phase 1 studies have been conducted and are described in Table 1. Additional information was 
collected from  studies performed in adult patients as presented in Table 2 with two pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(Studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302).  
A Population PK analysis of daridorexant was performed and comprised PK data from 17 studies (13 Phase 1, 
2 Phase 2, 2 Phase 3 studies). Therein, 412 healthy subjects (9420 plasma concentrations) and 1486 adult and 
elderly  subjects  with  insomnia  (3207  plasma  concentrations)  were  included  in  the  analysis  (1898  subjects 
providing 12,627 plasma concentrations in total).

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK data were analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. 
Standard  non-compartmental  (model-independent)  pharmacokinetic  methods  were  used  to  calculate  PK 
parameters. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Population parameters were estimated using the nonlinear 
mixed–effects modelling approach. The Fisher information matrix and log-likelihoods were generally estimated 
using  stochastic  approximation  unless  specified  otherwise  (linear  approximations  were  employed  in  case 
numerical convergence could not be achieved with stochastic approximation).  
Absorption 
Following single or multiple-dosing of daridorexant at doses between 5 mg to 200 mg in healthy volunteers, 
absorption was reasonably rapid with Cmax approximately achieved at median Tmax of 0.75-2.75 hours. At 25 
or 50 mg, median Tmax was generally achieved at 1-2h. 
Absolute bioavailability 
Absolute  bioavailability  (F)  of  daridorexant  has  been  investigated  in  humans.  In  the  100  mg  dose  group  of 
study AC-078-101, daridorexant showed an absolute bioavailability of 62.1%, with a 95% CI ranging from 
51.6 to 74.8%. 
Relative bioavailability / bioequivalence 
Throughout the clinical development, three  formulations were used, a soft gelatine capsule (Formulation B, 
strength at 25 mg), a hard gelatin capsule (Formulation A, strength at 5, 10, 25 and 100 mg), and a film-
coated  tablet  (strength  at  5,  10,  25  and  50  mg)  intended  for  commercial  use.  However  the  commercial 
formulation (please refer to the Quality section) have never been produced yet. 
Biocomparison Formulation B vs Formulation A  
Biocomparison  of  formulation  A  and  B  was  evaluated  in  the  25  mg  dose  group  of  Study  AC-078-101  in  a 
crossover design. Results of this study indicated  that  compared to Formulation A, Tmax  was shorter with a 
median difference (90% CI of the median) of –0.6 h (–1.09, –0.34), and Cmax was slightly higher with a ratio 
of geometric means (90% CI of the means) of 1.3 (1.06–1.53), AUC and t½ were similar.

Comparability Formulation A vs Tablet formulation 
The comparability of the daridorexant film coated tablets and hard gelatine capsule was investigated trough 
dissolution profiles comparison. 
Influence of food 
The effect of a standardized high fat meal on daridorexant PK was investigated in healthy subjects using the 
hard capsule formulation (Study AC-078-104) or the tablet formulation (Study ID-078-113).  
In  Study  AC-078-104,  the  effect  of  a  high  fat  meal  on  daridorexant  PK  was  investigated  in  20  healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 25 mg daridorexant (hard capsule) in the fasted and 
the fed states. PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal delayed Tmax by 1.88 h decreased 
Cmax by 24.3% and increase AUC0-24 by 3%. 
In  Study  ID-078-113,  the  effect  of  a  high  fat  meal  on  daridorexant  PK  was  investigated  in  20  healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 50 mg daridorexant (film-coated tablet) in the fasted 
and the fed states. PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal delayed Tmax by 1.28 h decreased 
Cmax by 15.6% and AUC0-24 by 8.7%. 
Gastric modifier 
In Study ID-078-120, the effect of a gastric pH modifier on daridorexant PK was investigated in 24 healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 50 mg daridorexant (film-coated tablet) in the fasted 
and 3h following the administration of 40 mg famotidine. PK results indicated that administration of famotidine 
delayed Tmax by 0.5 h, decreased Cmax by 39% and increased AUC0-48 by 3%. 
Distribution 
Protein Binding 
From samples collected during study AC-078-101, (Study B-16.001) using rapid equilibrium dialysis, the 
binding of daridorexant to human plasma proteins ranged between 99.7 and 99.9%. 
Blood Plasma ratio 
B/P ratio was approximately 0.64, indicating limit penetration of daridorexant into red blood cells. 
Volume of distribution 
Daridorexant Vss following an IV administration was estimated at 31 L suggesting low diffusion in tissue. This 
results was confirmed in studies ID-078-112 and ID-078-115 after accounting for F (Vz/F = 59 L to 66 L).  
Elimination 
Across clinical studies in healthy volunteers, after single oral (morning) administration of daridorexant as film 
coated  tablets  (25  or  50  mg),  median  half-life  ranged  from  6.2  to  11.7  h,  and  8.5  h  following  night  time 
administration. After repeated dose of daridorexant as HCG formulation (Formulation A) median half-life ranged 
from 5.6 to 8.5h. 
In healthy volunteers, CL was estimated at 4.97 L/h following administration of  daridorexant HCG. Based on 
the PopPK analysis a Michaelis-Menten elimination of daridorexant was considered with a Vm of 6.94 mg/h and 
a Km of 2.36 ng/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 42/141 
 
 
 
The main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme and excretion of metabolites in both 
urine and feces. 
•  Mass balance 
In study AC-078-101, a single oral dose of a 14C-radiolabeled daridorexant microtracer given simultaneously 
with a single oral dose of daridorexant as hard capsule of 50 mg was administered in 8 healthy subjects. 
The total recovery of radioactivity in this mass balance study was approximately 84.5% (CI95%: 78.3-90.6%). 
Approximately  56.6  %  and  27.9%  of  the  radioactive  dose  was  recovered  in  feces  and  urine  respectively, 
unchanged daridorexant was found at trace levels in both excretas (0.3% of cumulative dose excreted). 
•  Metabolism 
Daridorexant  was  extensively  metabolized.  9  metabolic  pathways  were  identified  with  3  are  of  major 
importance for excretion (63% of the dose) and 6 minor pathways, none of which contributed more than 3% 
to total dose excreted. 
A total of 77 metabolites and parent daridorexant were identified in plasma, urine and feces. Five metabolic 
reactions had been identified first in plasma, leading to 30 metabolites, of which 23 were found in urine as well, 
and 17 also found in faeces.  
In plasma, M3, M1, M10 and daridorexant accounted for 28.9%, 12.7%, 9.0% and 20.9%, respectively. 
Based on in vitro investigations daridorexant was found to be predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 (89%). 
M3 formation is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4. 
• 
Interconversion 
Daridorexant has an asymmetric carbon (S). 
• 
Pharmacokinetic of metabolites 
M1, M3 and M10 were investigated in several clinical trials (Study AC-078-104, AC-078-105, ID-078-112). 
None of them were found to be active. Estimated half-life of these metabolites ranged from 10 to 13h.  
Based  on in vitro investigations all  these  metabolites were  found to be P-gp  substrate and  highly bound  to 
plasma proteins. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Daridorexant exhibit a dose proportional increase of exposure for doses between 25 to 50 mg.  Across all the 
available clinical studies in both healthy and adult patients,  daridorexant show no or minimal accumulation. 
Steady state is generally reached by Day 2-3. 
Population-PK modeling 
Additional to formal PK investigations in healthy volunteers (phase 1 studies) and in patients with insomnia 
disorders (phase 2 and 3 studies), the applicant has performed one population PK analysis in order to describe 
and identify sources of variability of daridorexant in patients.  
The population PK analysis of daridorexant used pooled data from 17 clinical studies (13 Phase 1 [AC-078-
101, -102, -104, -105; ID-078-106, -107, -108, -111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -117], 2 Phase 2 [AC-
078A201, AC-078A202], and 2 Phase 3 studies [ID-078A301, and ID-078A302]). PK samples in insomnia 
patients (phase 2/3 studies) were sparsely taken (1 to 3 samples each), while in healthy volunteers (phase 1

studies) 6 to 28 post-dose samples were drawn each. Overall, the Population PK dataset (Table 3) included 
12,627 concentration measurements (3207 and 9420 from patients and HV, respectively) from 1898 subjects 
(1486  patients  and  412  Healthy  volunteers)  who  received  single  and  repeated-dose  administration  of 
daridorexant 5-200 mg in healthy volunteers and 5-50 mg in patients

doses,  an  absorption  lag  time  (Tlag),  a  linear  absorption  (ka),  and  nonlinear  elimination  (Vm,  Km)  at  high 
concentrations (> 800 ng/mL) reached with doses higher than 50 mg. IIV were included on all parameters.

Clinical relevance of effects of covariates / modality of use 
To  assess  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  covariates,  model-based  simulations  were  performed.  Using  the

Covariates were varied to include different ages (23 and 74 years), fat masses (13.1 and 39.1 kg), lean body

24h, and C8h summarised in Table 6 and

Simulations  indicated  that  the  largest  effects  on  daridorexant  exposures  were  seen  in  food  status,  time  of 
administration and fat mass composition. Food status fed results in a decrease of Cmax by 36%, a prolongation 
of tmax more than twice (4.48 h vs 2.1 h), a 16% higher C8h, and 7% lower AUC0-24h compared to light meal/ 
uncontrolled. Morning administration compared to evening administration showed an increase of Cmax by 29% 
and a shortening of 40% in tmax  (0.85 h). In  subject with  a fat mass, Cmax  was 21% lower, while  Tmax  was 
slightly shortened by about 14% and AUC0-24h only reduced by about 7.5% compared to that observed for a 
typical subject of 20 kg fat mass.  
All others subject-specific characteristics, including age, food status fasted, lean body weight and ALP, showed 
no  relevant  difference  (i.e.,  <20%)  in  exposure  parameters  AUC,  tmax,  Cmax,  and  C8h  compared  to  a  typical 
subject.  
Overall, given the fact that morning administration is not relevant clinically (with regards to the indication) and 
that high-fat high-calorie food is an extreme-case scenario unlikely to occur in clinical practice, the applicant’s 
recommendation that daridorexant is to be taken in the evening / night (within 30 minutes before going to 
bed) is endorsed.  
Special populations 
•  Hepatic impairment 
A formal dedicated PK study (ID-078-112) was performed in subjects with impaired hepatic function compared 
to matched-control healthy subjects to investigate the effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the 
PK of a single 25-mg dose of daridorexant.  
Results of the formal dedicated PK study indicated that the daridorexant Cmax decreased by 50% and 58% in 
mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects compared to healthy subjects. Similarly, daridorexant AUC0-inf 
decreased by 50% and 26%, in mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects. In contrast, half-life was found 
1.6-fold (11h) in mild and 2-fold increased (19h) in moderate compared to healthy subjects. 
The  unbound  fraction  of  daridorexant  appears  to  be  affected  by  increasing  hepatic  impairment  with 
approximately  an  increase  of  Cu/C  by  2-fold  in  moderate  hepatic  impaired  subjects  compared  to  healthy 
subjects. Therefore for moderate hepatic impairment subjects a dose of 25 mg is recommended.  
Daridorexant has not been studied and is not recommended in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. (Child-
Pugh score ≥ 10).  
•  Renal impairment 
A formal dedicated PK study (ID-078-115) was performed in subjects with impaired renal function compared 
to matched-control healthy subjects to investigate the effect of severe renal impairment on the PK of a single 
25-mg dose of daridorexant. PK results show that renal impairment have no effect on  daridorexant PK, this 
was expected, provided the results from the mass balance study.  
Therefore no dose adjustment are recommended in patients with any level of renal impairment. 
•  Gender 
No formal PK study to investigate the effect of gender on the PKs of daridorexant has been performed. Besides, 
the  effect  of  gender  on  the  PKs  of  daridorexant  was  investigated  in  patients  based  on  the  Population-PK 
approach. Among the 1898 included in the dataset, both sexes were represented with more female (n= 1155; 
60.9%) than male (n = 743; 39.1%).

In  Phase  3  studies  in  patients  with  insomnia  disorders,  next-morning  plasma  concentrations  tended  to  be 
slightly higher in females than in males. However, these differences disappeared once body composition (lean 
body weight and fat mass) was accounted for, which suggest that these two body size descriptors capture the 
sex difference ( 
Figure 11). The relationship, i.e., the slope of the linear regression fit, appears strongest in fat mass and BMI. 
Most relationships show a difference between the sexes (red and turquoise lines) while fat mass shows very 
similar regression fits for the sexes. 
Figure 11. Morning concentrations (dose-normalized) after evening administration vs body size descriptors in 
patients with insomnia disorder 
Assessing body composition, the graphical display of individual fat mass vs lean body weight shows a complete 
separation of sexes, suggesting that these two body size descriptors capture the sex difference (Figure 12).  
Figure 12. Fat mass vs lean body weight by sex in patients with insomnia disorder 
Based on the Population-PK analysis, when body composition is included in the model (lean body mass was 
found to be significant covariate on Vc and elimination parameter Km; while body fat mass was associated to 
Vp and Q), gender was no more identified as a significant covariate influencing PK parameters of daridorexant. 
Overall, based on these results, the applicant concluded that no adjustment dosing regimen is warranted based 
on sex. This conclusion is agreed.

•  Race 
Race effect was investigated in several clinical studies (AC-078-105, ID-078-116, ID-078A206).  
A formal dedicated From Study AC-078-105, in Japanese subjects, Cmax and AUC0-24h exposure (at 50 mg) 
were  higher  by  1.4-  and  1.3-fold,  respectively  compared  to  Caucasian  subjects.  However,  in  a  subsequent 
study (ID-078-116, please refer to next section), the daridorexant PK in Japanese subjects were similar to 
the  PK  observed  in  Caucasian  subjects  in  previous studies.  In  the  Japanese  Phase  2  study  in  subjects  with 
insomnia (ID-078A206), mean residual morning concentrations at 9−10 h post dose were slightly lower than 
those observed in the global Phase 2 and Phase 3 program, with no indication of next-day residual effects at 
any dose. 
Therefore there are no evidence that race have a clear effect on daridorexant PK at the 25 mg or the 50 mg 
dose. 
Among the 1898 subjects included in the dataset, a majority of patients n= 1646 (86.7%) are White Caucasian, 
n= 175 (9.2%) are Black or African American, n= 36 (0.02%) are Asian, n=17 (0.009%) are Japanese and 24 
are other race or not classified.  
Based  on the  Population-PK  approach, the  effect  of  race/ethnicity  on  daridorexant  PK  was  investigated  and 
found not to be a statistically significant covariate influencing PK parameters of  daridorexant. Given the  PK 
data available, this conclusion could only be endorsed for Black or African American (compared to the reference 
Caucasian race). For other races,  very limited data are  available to allow for valid  conclusions. Overall, the 
recommendation to no adjust the dose for Black or African American patients (compared to Caucasian) could 
be agreed. Dosing recommendations in other races (Asian, Japanese) should be rather based on NCA results 
from formal studies. 
•  Weight 
No formal studies were conducted to investigate the effect of BW on daridorexant PK.  
Based upon the Population-PK analysis, the effect of BMI and body weight as well as lean body weight (LBM) 
and fat mass (FM) were explored. LBM and FM were found to be a statistically significant covariates on volumes 
of  distribution  (Vc  and  Vp),  inter-compartmental drug  transfer  Q,  and elimination:  Vc  and  Vp  increase  with 
higher LBM and FM, respectively, while Km decrease (increase on elimination) with higher LBM. Despites this 
statistically significance of LBM and FM on PK parameters, this does not result on a clinically significant impact 
on the exposure parameters of daridorexant. Indeed, model-based simulations (50-mg once daily regimen) for 
a typical subject [60 years of age, 20 kg FM, 55 kg LBM, and 60 U/L ALP] using different LBM (from 36.2 to 
69.1 kg) and FM (13.1 and 39.1 kg) values corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentiles of the data, show 
that all LBM and FM effects on Cmax, AUC, tmax, and residual next-morning concentrations C8h metrics were <20% 
difference from the reference, excepted for the upper limit of FM (39.1 kg) which was associated to a decrease 
on Cmax of 21% (border line  influence) compared to that observed for a typical subject (Table 6 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 54/141 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13). It should be noted also that subsequent add of BW and BMI as covariates (assessed by graphical 
analyses and statistical criteria) did not result on additional relevant significance.   
Based on these findings, a flat dosing regimen (irrespective to BW) is proposed for daridorexant. This conclusion 
could be endorsed.

•  Age / Elderly  
PK of daridorexant in elderly (> 65 years) was evaluated after single and repeated administration in healthy 
subjects during two phase 1 studies (MAD and SAD parts of AC-078-102 and dedicated study ID-078-116 in 
elderly Japanese subjects), but also in patients with insomnia in Phase 2 and 3 studies. The impact of age was 
further investigated as a covariate in the Population-PK analysis of daridorexant. 
From Study AC-078-102, at a 25 mg dose, half-life was increased by 60%, and both Cmax and AUC increased 
by 30% in elderly subjects compared to young subjects.  
From Study ID-078-116, the PK parameters (Cmax and AUC) were generally similar except half-life which 
was approximately 2-fold greater in elderly subjects compared to non-elderly subjects. 
From Phase 2 and 3 studies, in line with observations from Phase 1 study (AC-078-102) in healthy volunteers, 
next-morning  plasma  concentrations  (C8-9h)  in  patients  with  insomnia  disorders  which  received  the 
recommended  50  mg  dose  were  found  28%  (557  /433  ng/mL  =1.28;)  and  27%  (591  /465  ng/mL  =1.27) 
higher elderly patients compared to those observed in younger adults in Phase 2 and Phase 3, respectively.  
Population-PK approach 
- The median age (min; max) of subjects included in the population dataset was 54 years (18; 88). However, 
among the 1898 subjects included, the number of elderly subjects and PK samples included in the different 
subgroups of age: [65 to 74 years], [75 to 84 years] and >85 years old is not known.  
Age was investigated as a continuous covariate in the context of the population-PK analysis, wherein it was 
identified as a statistically significant covariate and retained in the final model for daridorexant on elimination 
parameter Km [(Age/60)0.3] with exponent estimated to 0.3 (RSE =6.87%). This suggests that patients with 
higher age are expected to have higher Km (i.e., drug elimination decreases). However, based on model-based 
simulations,  this  finding  did  not  result  on  a  clinically  significant  difference  on  the  exposure  parameters  of 
daridorexant (Cmax, AUC0-24h, tmax, and C8-9h). Indeed, when varying age from 23 to 74 years (corresponding to 
the 5th and 95th percentiles of the data), all effects are found <20% difference from a typical subject (aged 60 
years-old). The more pronounced difference is predicted in subject aged 23 years, with AUC0-24h and C8h to be 
16% and 16.7% lower than those in a typical subject of 60 years. Further, when taking extremes 5th and 95th 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 56/141 
 
 
 
 
percentiles of age values, the Population-PK model predicted that, after taking 50 mg daridorexant at bedtime, 
a 74-year‑old subject would have a residual C8-9h morning 20% higher than a 23-year-old subject. 
Based on all the above, the applicant concluded that dose adjustments in elderly patients are not warranted. 
Further investigations regarding PKs of daridorexant in elderly were requested and provided by the applicant 
during the responses to the D120 and D180 LoQ. These data overall support that no significant PK change is 
to be expected in the elderly population. Therefore, the applicant’s dosing recommendation in elderly patients 
can be supported although it should be emphasized that limited PK data are available in patients > 75 years of 
age. A specific statement reflecting this point has been included in section 5.2. of the SmPC. 
Interactions 
Effects of other drugs on daridorexant 
Daridorexant was not identified as BCRP or P-gp substrates. Only metabolites M1 and M10 transports were 
mediated by P-gp.  
Daridorexant clearance is mostly dependent on CYP3A4, accounting for 89% of metabolic turnover based on 
nonclinical experiments [B-15.073]. CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are expected to modify daridorexant PK.  
CYP Daridorexant administered at 25 mg induced a 1.4- and 2.4-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-∞ 
respectively when co-administered with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor diltiazem (240 mg, at steady state). 
It is expected an even more marked inhibition of CYP3A4 following strong CYP3A4 administration at the 
therapeutic dose of 50 mg.  
Co-administration with the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz (600 mg) at steady state, daridorexant 50 mg 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ decreased by 35% and 61%, respectively.  
Based on in vitro results, daridorexant induction potential for CYP2C9 and CYP2B6 could not be excluded. No 
in vivo study to assess daridorexant induction potency for CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 has been provided. 
The main metabolites M1 and M3 induction potential was only evaluated for CYP2B6 and 1A2. Both 
metabolites were inducers of CYP2B6 but not of CYP1A2. No investigation was conducted for CYP2C9 (e.g. 
warfarin or tolbutamide as probe substrate). 
SSRI Coadministration of citalopram 20 mg, a SSRI, did not affect daridorexant PK at 50 mg (study ID-078-
114).  
Alcohol Co-administration of daridorexant 50 mg and ethanol as an i.v. infusion led to a prolonged tmax of 
daridorexant of 1.25 h. The other PK parameters, Cmax, AUC0-∞, and t½, were unchanged (study ID-078-
111). 
Effect of daridorexant on other drugs 
CYPs Daridorexant and its metabolites M1, M3, and M10 inhibition potential for CYPs isoforms recommended 
per EMA guideline was, in general, adequately conducted. In vitro, daridorexant was identified as potential 
inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 which latter inhibition was time-dependent. Only daridorexant 
inhibition for CYP3A4 was investigated in vivo in study AC-078-104 with midazolam following a two fold-lower 
dose than the recommended (i.e. 25 mg versus 50 mg). Inferences of expected inhibition of CYP3A4 by 
daridorexant following 50 mg oral dosing was assessed by PBPK model, which is not endorsed due to 
unsufficient qualification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 57/141 
 
 
 
 
The PK results showed no significant impact on midazolam exposure (GMR = 1.1 and 90% CI 1.03 - 1.19) 
but a trend toward an increase in Cmax (GMR = 1.2 and 90% CI 1.07 – 1.34). Inferences of expected 
inhibition of CYP3A4 by daridorexant following 50 mg oral dosing addressed by a PBPK model is not 
endorsed. The clinical results with midazolam should be reflected in SmPC, in particular the trend toward a 
Cmax increase following 25 mg daridorexant. Effect on CYP3A4 substrate following 50 mg daridorexant is 
thus uncertain. 
In vitro, daridorexant induced CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. It may be inducer of CYP enzyme regulated by PXR 
pathway including CYP2C9 in vivo. No clinical study with CYP2C9 was submitted to assess the clinical 
relevance of the in vitro results. 
Transporters In vitro investigations on daridorexant potential inhibition for transporters were conducted in 
agreement with EMA interactions guideline. Daridorexant inhibition for P-gp or BCRP in vivo cannot be 
excluded with estimated IC50 of 24 µM (digoxin as substrate) for P-gp and 3 µM for BCRP.  
Only daridorexant inhibition potential for BCRP was further investigated in the clinical DDI (study 78-106) 
where co-administration of 25 mg daridorexant with rosuvastatin, BCRP probe substrate. The result of this 
study show daridorexant following 25 mg oral dosing did not affect rosuvastatin PK. The impact of 
daridorexant at the 50 mg therapeutic dose was addressed by PBPK which model is not considered 
sufficiently qualified. 
No in vivo investigation was performed for P-gp inhibition with adequate probe substrate (e.g. dabigatran). 
Alcohol Co-administration of daridorexant 50 mg and ethanol as an i.v. infusion led to a prolonged tmax of 
daridorexant of 1.25 h. The other PK parameters, Cmax, AUC0-∞, and t½, were unchanged (study ID-078-
111). 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
Daridorexant, also known as ACT-541468, is a specific and potent DORA acting on both orexin 1 (OX1) and 
orexin 2 (OX2) receptors. The orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) act on orexin receptors to promote 
wakefulness. It could therefore be hypothesized that daridorexant will act on sleep maintenance and on sleep 
latency in contrast with hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and z-drugs which act mainly on sleep latency.  
Exposure-response analysis for efficacy 
Data from the two pivotal B/R Phase 3 studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302 were used.  
The observed steady state (Month 1 and Month 3) daridorexant plasma concentrations measured in the morning 
9–10 h (C9-10h) was the exposure PK metric. To  assess efficacy,  the changes from  baseline  to month 1 and 
month 3 for the primary [Latency to persistent sleep (LPS and Wake after sleep onset (WASO)], secondary 
[Total  sleep  time  (sTST)  and  Insomnia  Daytime  Symptoms  and  Impacts  Questionnaire  (IDSiq) 
sleepiness/tiredness domain score] efficacy endpoints (determined by PSG), with additional clinical endpoints 
[Visual analog scale (VAS) for quality of sleep, depth of sleep, daytime alertness and daily ability to function] 
were analyzed. These clinical endpoints are qualified as clinically valid / pertinent for the purpose (please refer 
to clinical efficacy report).  
Assessment report

No population PKPD modelling was developed. Graphical scatter plots with a linear regression were provided 
to  link  exposure  parameter  C9-10h  to  the  efficacy  endpoints  (LPS  and  WASO,  sTST,  and  IDSIQ 
sleepiness/tiredness domain score). From the provided plots ( 
Figure 14 and  
Figure 15), no correlation between the change from baseline in the selected efficacy variables and daridorexant 
C9-10h  from  both 25 and  50 mg (study  ID-078A301)  or 10 and  25  mg  (study  ID-078A302) was observed. 
However, it should be noted that the estimated regression coefficients β and error terms ε for the different 
relationships were not provided or could not be found.

Based on these findings, the applicant concluded that daridorexant concentrations measured the next morning 
do not have an obvious correlation to the efficacy  assessed during the previous night. Even this conclusion 
could  be  agreed  (based  on  the  shape  of  provided  exposure/clinical  endpoints  relationships),  the  provided 
analyses do not appear relevant to draw valid conclusions regarding the purpose of dosing recommendations; 
and this at least for two points:   
- The targeted response (changes from baseline) that should at least be reached to inform success of treatment 
is neither stated / clear nor its achievement (or not) was investigated and compared between doses levels to 
allow more robust comparison of dose/exposure effectiveness, 
- From a PK perspective, the probabilities of distributions of the PK endpoint (C9-10h) observed at both 25 and 
50 mg doses (Figure 16) on one hand or those from 10 and 25 mg doses (

provided exposure-efficacy analysis should only be considered as exploratory and not be used to support dosing

 Overall,  the 
Exposure-response analysis for safety 
Data from the two pivotal B/R Phase 3 studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302 were used. Exposure PK metric 
is the same that for the E-R analysis for efficacy (morning C9-10h concentrations at Month 1 and 3). To assess 
the safety, the changes from baseline to month 1 and month 3 for the related parameters on next-morning 
residual effect: coding sub-test© and morning sleepiness score on the visual analog scale were selected.  
No population PKPD modeling was developed. Graphical scatter plots with a linear regression were provided to 
link  steady  state  exposure  parameter  (C9-10h)  to  the  safety  endpoints  (coding  sub-test©  and  morning 
sleepiness score on the visual analog scale).  No correlation between the change from baseline in the selected 
efficacy variables and daridorexant exposure parameter (C9-10h) issued from both 25 and 50 mg (study ID-
078A301) or 10 and 25 mg (study ID-078A302) was observed.  
Based on this finding, the applicant concluded that the exposure to daridorexant measured the next morning 
does not have an obvious correlation to the safety next-morning residual effect. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
ADME 
Relative Bioavailability/Bioequivalence 
Across the  clinical development, three oral  formulations were  developed (Formulation B, Formulation A and 
film coated tablets). Importantly, no PK data are available for the commercial formulation which differs slightly 
compared to the film coated tablets used in phase 1 and pivotal B/R phase 3 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 63/141 
 
 
 
 
Bridging Capsule formulation A versus Tablet formulation   
The capsule formulation A (used in early phase 1 and phase 2 studies) and the tablet product (used in phase 
1 to pivotal B/R studies) have different qualitative composition and different manufacturing process. No formal 
dedicated  comparative  bioavailability  study  was  performed  to  confirm  the  comparability  of  the 
biopharmaceutical  performance  between  the  two  formulations  and  allow  extrapolation  of  PK  properties  / 
findings  collected  with  capsule  A  to  the  tablet  formulation.  Instead,  in  vitro  investigations  (comparison  of 
dissolution profiles) and food effects comparison have been performed.  
Both formulations have a pH-dependent dissolution profiles, and except at, the dissolution profiles are different 
between formulations. Moreover, indirect comparison between studies (with different subjects, design, doses, 
experimental conditions, uncontrolled variability etc..) is not considered to provide adequate /appropriate data 
to draw valid conclusions regarding the PK/ bioavailability comparability between the two formulations neither 
for  the  fasted  nor  for  the  fed  state.  In  conclusion,  bioavailability  comparative  data  between  the  capsule 
formulation A and the tablet product are lacking. The applicant was requested to provide such data or explain 
why not doing so. No bioavailability comparative data between the two formulations (hard capsule vs tablet) 
was provided. According to the applicant, a bio comparison study was not considered necessary before starting 
Phase  3  studies,  provided  the  in  vitro  dissolution  profiles  and  a  claimed  near  complete  absorption  of 
daridorexant  as  no  parent  drug  was  observed  in  feces.  Nevertheless  based  on  the  PopPK  analysis  the 
formulation effect, tested as a covariate was not found to have a significant effect on daridorexant PK.   
Bridging to-be marketed product versus phase 3 B/R tablet formulation   
No PK/ clinical data is available with the product intended for commercial use that was never used throughout 
the clinical development. However, this product version is identical to tablet formulation used in phase 1 and 
in the pivotal phase 3 studies, except for the colour of coating (light orange during clinical studies for blinding 
purpose  versus different colours for commercial formulation). From  a PK point  of view,  it’s agreed that this 
small /minor difference is not expected to have a significant impact on the biopharmaceutical performances of 
the product.  Additional  in vitro  investigations  (comparison of  dissolution  profiles)  were  requested  to  ensure 
quality pharmaceutical comparability and submitted with satisfactory results. 
Distribution volume 
Daridorexant Vss following an IV administration was estimated at 31 L suggesting low diffusion in tissue. This 
results was confirmed in studies ID-078-112 and ID-078-115 after accounting for F (Vz/F = 59 L to 66 L).  
However these NCA estimates of the volume of distribution appears to be not consistent with that estimated 
based on the Population-PK model (V/F = 28.3 L with Vp and Vc of 14.6 and 13.7 L, respectively). The applicant 
was asked to explain such discrepancy, however no conclusive explanation was provided, the issue was not 
further pursued. 
Dose proportionality  
Dose proportionality was assessed in several studies: 
From 5 to 200 mg or 5 to 50 mg a less than dose proportional increase of PK parameters was observed (Study 
AC-078-101), or from 10 to 75 mg (single dose or at steady-state, Study AC-078-102-Part A), or from 25 
to 50 mg (Study AC-078-105) or from 50 mg to 150 mg (AC-078-107). In these studies daridorexant was 
administered as hard capsule. Such dose non-linearity was to note handled in the PopPK analysis by using a 
MM elimination.

Only  in  study  ID-078-116,  from  10  to  50  mg,  where  daridorexant  was  administered  as  tablet,  both  PK 
parameters increased with increasing dose. In contrast in the multiple dose study ID-078A206 performed in 
Japenese  subjects,  no  dose  proportionality  assessment  was  performed,  nevertheless,  as  stated  by  the 
applicant, the C9h-10h increase after increasing dose, this is agreed, however in a less than dose proportional 
manner.  
In addition, based on the structure of the PopPK model (please refer to section 2.1.8), the non-linear behaviour 
of  daridorexant  has  been  handled  at  two  levels  with  the  parameterization  of  a  less  than  dose  proportional 
bioavailability (dose as covariate on F), and by using a MM elimination. 
All together the statement in the SmPC that “Daridorexant plasma exposure is dose proportional at doses up 
to 50 mg” is not endorsed, as available PK data suggests a less than dose proportional increase for the entire 
tested range of doses up to 50 mg. The applicant was asked to discuss this issue and to propose a rewording 
of this statement. To this end, throughout the clinical development program, the applicant summarized all the 
observed exposure AUC0-24h, Cmax and C9-10h ratios compared to the theoretical expected ones using the 
different dose levels tested. Currently, the focus is met on the recommended dose interval 25 to 50mg and the 
statement of an approximately dose proportional increase of exposure of daridorexant between 25 and 50 mg 
could be agreed. Over the course of the assessmenthe Applicant shared this statement and updated the SmPC 
accordingly. 
Population PK analysis  
In response to D120 question, the applicant has clarified that models 611 and 623 in the Pop-PK model (report 
D‑20.188)  used  exclusively  dense  PK  sampling  from  Phase  1  studies.  The  structural  model  as  well  as  PK 
parameters estimates were subsequently fixed in the further models (710 and the final one 831) that integrated 
sparse  PK  data  from  phase  2  and  3  studies  (providing  only  next ‑ morning  C9-10  samples  i.e.,  single 
measurements over a dosing interval) As such samples cannot robustly estimate absorption and elimination 
parameters and may lead to unreliable parameter estimates and large RSE, the adopted sequential approach 
of parameter estimation is acceptable. 
Overall, population typical values, associated variabilities and covariate effects were in general fixed for the 
final model (run 831) except for covariate effects on volumes, Q and Km who were precisely estimated (low 
RSE% <20%, except for the effect of lean body weight on km: RSE 25.95%). The magnitude of the proportional 
errors  was  low  (16%)  and  the  additive  error  was  estimated  at  17.6  ng/L  (acceptable  when  compared  to 
geometric mean steady state Cmax around 800 ng/L with the recommended 50 mg dose and taking into account 
that no correlation between low concentrations neither with efficacy nor safety endpoints was demonstrated). 
A high variability was observed for absorption-related parameters: CV% of 51% and 76.8% for Tlag and ka, 
respectively, 64.8% for F; while moderate IIV was observed for remaining parameters: 41.2 and 47.9% Vcentral 
and Vperipheral, respectively and 30% and 60% for Vm and Km, respectively.  
No major deficiencies could be noted for the diagnostic plots. Furthermore, pcVPCs suggests that the model 
describe well the observed data across the dose range from 5 to 200 mg in healthy subjects and 5 to 50 mg in 
patients  with  insomnia  disorder  (despite  some  over-prediction  and  high  predicted  variability  for  the  higher 
doses of 150 and 200 mg, which will have no clinical consequences, given the recommended doses of 25 to 50 
mg  in  clinic).  The  model  seems  to  show  acceptable  descriptive  and  predictive  performance  across  the 
recommended dose range from 25 to 50 mg in patients with insomnia disorder. 
Based on the findings of the Pop-PK model, the typical absolute bioavailability (F) was estimated to 0.41 for 
the reference dose 50 mg. F was found to decrease with higher doses: at 100 mg dose, F is estimated to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 65/141 
 
 
 
around 0.33. However, using the NCA approach, daridorexant showed an average F estimate of 0.62 for the 
100 mg dose based on results of the ADME study AC-078-101. At D120, the applicant was asked to provide a 
clear estimate of F at the recommended dose of 50 mg. Based on the relative bioavailability of  daridorexant 
for the 50 mg versus 100 mg calculated based on the modelling approach (0.41/0.33 =1.23), an estimate of F 
= 0.75 is proposed at 50 mg for the NCA approach. This estimate (0.75) is not consistent with that from the 
Population  approach  (0.41).  Overall,  estimation  of  F  daridorexant  after  oral  administration  appears  not 
consistent from both methods (NCA versus population modeling). The applicant was again asked to justify this 
discrepancy. In the responses to Day180 LoQ, the Applicant explain that the population PK model did not utilise 
the  i.v.  data  and  that  the  most  robust  estimate  of  F  should  be  derived  by  the  NCA  method  applied  to  the 
dedicated study AC-078-101 with oral and intravenous administration of  daridorexant to the same subjects. 
This statement is agreed. Therefore, data from the Population PK model (neither F estimate = 0.41 nor the 
relation of F for 2 different doses based on which F estimate is calculated: F = 62.1%*1.23 = 75% with a dose 
of 50 mg.) should not be used to estimate F. Overall, the only reliable estimate of F is available with the 100 
mg dose and no data could be provided with the 50 mg dose level. This was reflected in the SmPC and the 
issue was considered as solved.  
The apparent typical volume of distribution was estimated to 28.3 L (Vp and Vc of 14.6 and 13.7 L, respectively) 
which  appears  far  from  that  estimated  by  NCA  analysis  (see  above).  In  response  to  D120  question,  the 
requested daridorexant half-life elimination (t½) estimate from the Pop-PK model is provided. Based on model 
parameters estimates, this gives a t½ = 8.1 h and 7.4 h, in line with NCA analyses (t½ = 6–8 h). 
Food status (fasted, light meal/ uncontrolled, fed) and time of drug administration (morning, evening) were 
identified as significant covariates on absorption parameters (ka and or Tlag). The Vc was associated with lean 
body mass and the Vp and Q were associated with body fat mass. The elimination parameter Km was found to 
be related to lean body weight, age, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). To assess the clinical relevance of the 
covariates,  model-based  simulations  were  performed  using  the  recommended  50  mg  once  daily  (o.d)  for  3 
days and a typical subject (60 years of age, 20 kg fat mass, 55 kg lean body weight and 60 U/L ALP). Covariates 
were varied to include different ages (23 and 74 years), fat masses  (13.1 and 39.1 kg), lean body weights 
(36.2 and 69.1 kg), and ALP (38 and 99 U/L), corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentiles of the data.  
Simulations  of  exposure  parameters  Cmax,  tmax,  AUC0-24h,  and  C8h  indicated  that  the  largest  effects  on 
daridorexant exposures were seen in food status, time of administration. Food status fed results in a decrease 
of Cmax by 36%, a prolongation of tmax more than twice (4.48 h vs 2.1 h), a 16% higher C8h, and 7% lower 
AUC0-24h compared to light meal/ uncontrolled. Morning administration compared to evening administration 
showed  an  increase  of  Cmax  by  29%  and  a  shortening  of  40%  in  tmax  (0.85  h).  All  others  subject-specific 
characteristics, including age, Food status fasted, lean body weight and ALP,  showed no relevant difference 
(i.e., <20%) in exposure parameters AUC, tmax, Cmax, and C8h compared to a typical subject.  
Overall, given the fact that morning administration is not relevant clinically (with regards to the indication) and 
that high-fat high-calorie food is an extreme-case scenario unlikely to occur in clinical practice, the applicant’s 
recommendation that daridorexant is to be taken in the evening / night (within 30 minutes before going to 
bed) is endorsed.  
Special populations 
Age/Elderly 
For completeness of the data and in order to endorse the proposed flat dosing recommendations in the elderly 
population, the applicant was asked to specify the number of patients with PK observations included in the 
following  subgroups  of  age:  [65  to  74  years],  [75  to  84  years]  and  >85  years.  For  each  class  of  age,  PK 
Assessment report

exposure  metrics  at  steady  state  (AUC0-24h,  Cmax,  C8h  and  Cmin)  after  repeated  administration  of  the 
recommended 50 mg OD should be derived from the final Pop-PK model to provide dosing recommendations. 
If no clinical / PK data were available or insufficient for one of the subgroups, this should be clearly implemented 
(warnings for inclusion) in the SmPC.  The requested data was provided over the course of the assessment. 
Overall,  data  from  495  and  85  subjects  were  available  in  the  age  ranges  65–74  years  and  75–84  years, 
respectively. However, only 4 subjects with age 85 and higher were included in the study population.  
Overall,  the  model-predicted  concentrations  did  not  indicate  any  significant  (>20%)  PK  change  in  elderly 
patients (C8h ranging from 512 to 548 ng/mL in comparison to a reference C8h value of 491 ng/mL in subjects 
≤65 years old). Therefore, the applicant conclusion that no dose adjustment in elderly patients is warranted 
could be endorsed. A statement reflecting the limited extent of PK data available in patients > 75 years of age 
has been included in section 5.2. of the SmPC. 
Interactions 
The PBPK model submitted is considered insufficiently qualified for its intended purpose. Therefore 
extrapolations on DDI outcomes based on PBPK simulations is not considered acceptable. In general, because 
of the large target population with high probabilities of various co-morbidities, the drug-drug interactions 
study mentioned below needs to be addressed in vivo as post-approval measure.  
Effects of other drugs on daridorexant 
CYPs Daridorexant administered at 25 mg induced a 1.4- and 2.4-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-∞ 
respectively when co-administered with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor diltiazem (240 mg, at steady state). 
It is expected an even more marked daridorexant exposure following strong CYP3A4 administration at the 
therapeutic dose of 50 mg. Given the large target population which includes the elderly, and the SNC-related 
AEs (e.g. dizziness, somnolence), an increase in these AE’s along with the increase in exposure resulting from 
association with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is probable. Daridorexant is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor.  
Effect of daridorexant on other drugs 
CYPs:  
The conducted DDI study to assess daridorexant effect on midazolam PK, CYP3A4 probe substrate, was not 
conducted at the therapeutic dose of 50 mg but two-fold lower (i.e. 25 mg). These results could thus not be 
extrapolated to PK interactions between midazolam and daridorexant administered at the therapeutic dose of 
50 mg, in particular when considering the trend toward a Cmax increase following 25 mg daridorexant. 
Daridorexant as CYP3A4 both time-dependent inhibitor and inducer, the net effect following 50 mg 
daridorexant is thus uncertain, and this is reflected in SmPC by caution of use with CYP3A4 substrates and 
avoidance of concomitant use with CYP3A4 substrates with NTI. To document this interaction potential, 
following D195 response, the Applicant has committed to conduct interaction study with midazolam as PAM.  
Based on in vitro results, daridorexant induction potential for CYP2C9 could not be excluded. Cautions of use 
in case of association of daridorexant with CYP2C9 substrates with close monitoring in case of NTI drugs co-
administration has been specified in SmPC. To document the interaction potential with CYP2C9 substrates, I 
the Applicant has committed to conduct n vivo study to assess daridorexant induction potency for CYP2C9 
should be provided as PAM.

In vitro investigations showed daridorexant inhibition for P-gp or BCRP in vivo cannot be excluded with 
estimated IC50 of 24 µM (digoxin as substrate) for P-gp and 3 µM for BCRP.  
Only  daridorexant  inhibition  potential  for  BCRP  was  further  investigated  in  the  clinical  DDI  (study  78-106) 
where  co-administration  of  25  mg  daridorexant  with  rosuvastatin,  BCRP  probe  substrate.  The  result  of  this 
study show daridorexant following 25 mg oral dosing did not affect rosuvastatin PK. The impact of daridorexant 
at the 50 mg therapeutic dose was addressed by PBPK which model is not endorsed. As a results, the impact 
of co-administration of BCRP substrate with daridorexant at 50 mg, on BCRP substrate PK is uncertain. Caution 
should be use in case of concomitant treatment of daridorexant with BCRP substrates has been specified in 
SmPC. The Applicant has committed to conduct clinical DDI study with rosuvastatin at therapeutic dose as PAM. 
No in vivo investigation was performed for  P-gp inhibition with  adequate probe  substrate (e.g.  dabigatran). 
Consequently, following 50 mg daridorexant, clinically significant inhibition of P-gp cannot be excluded. As a 
result, SmPC 4.5 section has specified caution of use in case of concomitant treatment of daridorexant with P-
gp drug substrates with cross reference to 5.2 section where in vitro interaction results should be reported. 
The Applicant has committed to conduct the clinical drug-drug interactions with 50 mg daridorexant and P-gp 
drug substrates as PAM.  
PKPD relationships 
No PKPD modelling were provided to link daridorexant exposure parameters with relevant PD parameters that 
would  be  associated  to  clinical  efficacy  and  safety.  For  the  purpose,  only  graphical  scatter  plots  with  linear 
regressions were provided. Based on the pivotal B/R Phase 3 studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302, no evident 
correlation  between  the  available  exposure  parameter  (morning  C9-10h  measured  at  Month  1  and  3)  neither 
with the selected efficacy (changes from baseline to month 1 and month 3 of treatment for LPS, WASO, sTST, 
and IDSIQ sleepiness/tiredness domain score) nor with and safety endpoints (changes from baseline to month 
1 and month 3 for coding sub-test© and morning sleepiness score on the visual analog scale) was observed for 
both 25 and 50 mg (study ID-078A301) or 10 and 25 mg doses (study ID-078A302). Even these conclusions 
could  be  agreed  (based  on  the  shape  of  provided  exposure/clinical  endpoints  relationships),  it  should  be 
emphasized  that  the  provided  analyses  do  not  appear  relevant  to  draw  valid  conclusions  on  dosing 
recommendations. Indeed, a) the targeted response (changes from baseline) that should at least be reached 
to inform success / safety of treatment is neither clear nor its achievement (or not) was compared between 
the dose levels; and b) the substantial overlap for the probabilities of distributions on C9-10h observed for the 
25 and 50 mg doses on one hand and for the 10 and 25 mg doses on the other hand preclude a clear distinction 
between dose levels.  
To conclude from a PKPD perspective, the provided analyses for exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety 
should only be considered as exploratory and not be used to support dosing recommendations, that should 
be based on formal clinical efficacy and safety evidence at the doses of interest. 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SAFETY STUDIES 
In a specific phase 1 study (111), the concomitant administration of daridorexant 50 mg and ethanol (5 h 
intravenous infusion at 0.6 g/L) was assessed and led to reinforced drug actions indicative of an additive 
effect on PD markers without any evidence of a synergic effect of daridorexant and ethanol on any of the 
defined PD variables. Somnolence is the main reported AE with a higher frequency in the daridorexant group 
with or without alcohol compared to the placebo group with or without alcohol. Alcohol consumption is

therefore not recommended during treatment with daridorexant in the SmPC. For this matter, a precaution 
for concomitant use is stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This kind of precaution is in accordance with CNS-
depressant effect, which reflects the expected pharmacological effect. 
In a specific phase 1 study (108), a driving study was performed with a simulator in healthy subjects without 
sleep disorder, at therapeutic (50 mg) and supratherapeutic (100 mg) doses, compared to placebo and 
zopiclone. The results showed a dose-dependent impairment of driving performance 9 hours after first dose 
administration with daridorexant, but that effect disappeared after repeated doses (4 consecutive nights), 
even at the supratherapeutic dose of 100 mg. The incidence of AEs i.e. fatigue or somnolence was rather 
high at Day 2 and considerably decreased at Day 5. Thus the driving performance seems not significantly 
impaired after a few days of treatment. However, some clarifications need to be provided regarding this 
study. Concerning the SmPC, a special warning and precaution for use is stated in sections 4.4 and 4.7. 
In two specific phase 1 studies (109 and 110), the effect of daridorexant 50 mg on night-time respiratory and 
sleep parameters in subjects with moderate COPD and in subjects with mild or moderate OSA was 
investigated. For study 109, patients with COPD received 50 mg daridorexant and the treatment did not 
cause oxygen desaturation after single-dose administration and at steady state compared to placebo. Overall, 
there seems to be no deleterious effect of daridorexant in subjects with moderate COPD. A statement related 
to the absence of data in patients with severe COPD is added in the SmPC. The statement for subjects with 
moderate COPD was deleted from the SmPC as no safety signal has been observed (see SmPC). For study 
110, patients with mild or with moderate OSA received 50 mg daridorexant and the treatment had no effect 
on AHI after single-dose administration and at steady state compared to placebo. Overall, there seems to be 
no deleterious effect of daridorexant in subjects with mild-to-moderate OSA. A statement related to the 
absence of data in patients with severe OSA is added in the SmPC. The statement for subjects with mild to 
moderate OSA was deleted from the SmPC as no safety signal has been observed. 
In a specific phase 1 study (117), patients received daridorexant to evaluate the effect of single therapeutic 
(50 mg) and supratherapeutic (200 mg) single doses of daridorexant on the QT/QTc interval duration in ECGs 
within the first 24 hours of administration vs placebo and the active comparator moxifloxacine 400 mg. It 
fulfilled the requirements to conclude that daridorexant meets the ICH E14 criteria of a negative TQT study. 
Thus, daridorexant doses up to 200 mg did not prolong the QT interval. The statement related to the cardiac 
electrophysiology was deleted from section 5.1 of the SmPC as no safety signal has been observed. 
In a specific study assessing the human abuse potential of daridorexant (107), patients received daridorexant 
at therapeutic and supratherapeutic single oral doses compared to the control drugs suvorexant and zolpidem 
in healthy recreational drug users. Daridorexant (50 mg, 100, mg and 150 mg) drug-liking was observed as 
compared to placebo in healthy current sedative recreational users and seems comparable to that of 
suvorexant (150 mg), and zolpidem (30 mg) at supratherapeutic doses (100 mg and 150 mg). The analysis 
of TEAES suggestive of drug abuse potential from phase 3 studies did not permit to confirm the abuse risk of 
daridorexant for the target population of patient with insomnia under experimental conditions (exclusion of 
patients with a history of abuse or addiction to alcohol or other drugs). The Applicant’s proposal to add 
“Abuse potential” safety concern as important potential risk on the RMP, and a warning in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC was endorsed.  
Considering the risk of withdrawal syndrome, no AEs indicating a withdrawal syndrome were observed in 301, 
303 and pool safety data while significant higher proportion of subjects with at least one risk symptom BWSQ 
item scored as severe (>20) at the end of treatment withdrawal period in the daridorexant group was observed 
as compared to placebo.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of daridorexant was thoroughly investigated using the non-compartmental and nonlinear-mixed effects 
modelling approaches. Overall, the PK properties of daridorexant product to be administered by oral route are 
considered as sufficiently characterized.  
There are concerns on the clinical relevance of the in vitro induction of CYP2C9 and the inhibition of BCRP and 
P-gp,  and  most  importantly  on  the  clinical  outcome  of  daridorexant  at  50  mg  as  perpetrator  on  CYP3A4 
substrates in absence of clinical data. These interactions should be investigated in vivo considering the large 
target population with various co-morbidities and/or co-medications, and daridorexant being a first in class in 
Europe. As a consequence, in absence of clinical data 4.5 section of SmPC  was amended to cover potential 
interactions which may affect efficacy, and or safety of the drug products. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The DDI studies have been requested and will be conducted by February 2023:   
Clinical interaction study with midazolam, clinical interaction study with P-gp drug substrate (dabigatran) 
clinical interaction study with BCRP drug substrate (rosuvastatin), clinical interaction study with CYP2C9 drug 
substrate (warfarin).  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical evidence of the efficacy and safety of daridorexant in the treatment of patients with insomnia is 
primarily derived from 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies, ID-078A301 (named study 301 in this AR) and ID-078A302 
(study 302), supported by the interim results from one ongoing DB Phase 3 extension study, ID-078A303 
(study 303), and two Phase 2 dose-finding studies, AC-078A201 (study 201 in adult subjects) and 
AC‑078A202 (study 202 in elderly subjects). 
Dose-response studies  
Dose finding was performed in phase 2 studies in adults (study 201) and elderly patients (study 202) with 
moderate to severe insomnia. The following doses were assessed: 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg compared to 
placebo. Study 201 includes zolpidem arm as an active reference. No statistical comparison between 
daridorexant and zolpidem was performed. 
Study 201 
The primary efficacy objective parameter is Wake after sleep onset (WASO) and secondary endpoints are 
latency to persistent sleep (LPS), subjective latency to sleep onset (sLSO) and subjective WASO (sWASO). 
WASO represents duration in minutes of awakenings. LPS measures the time in minutes to sleep onset. Both 
are assessed objectively by polysomnography. sLSO and sWASO are reported by the patient with sleep diary 
questionnaire (SDQ).

In study 201, statistically significant superiority over placebo is shown at the 25 mg and 50 mg doses for the 
primary efficacy objective parameter (WASO) and first objective secondary endpoint (LPS). No statistically 
significant superiority over placebo at the 10 mg dose is observed for the primary endpoint. Statistically 
significant superiority over placebo at the 10 mg dose is observed for first secondary endpoint (LPS). 
Subjective endpoint (sWASO and sLSO) did not show a statistically significant difference over placebo for all 
doses. No statistically significant effect of zolpidem compared to placebo is observed for WASO. A Statistically 
significant superiority of zolpidem over placebo is observed for LPS. This might be explained by zolpidem 
mechanism of action. 
Study 202 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022

Study 202 performed in elderly patients provided dose finding data compared to placebo with a crossover 
design.  
Statistically significant superiority over placebo is shown at the 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg doses for the 
primary efficacy objective parameter (WASO) and first objective secondary endpoint (LPS). No statistic 
comparison is made on sWASO and sLSO but the effect on these secondary endpoints is higher with 
daridorexant than placebo and increase with the dose.  
The dose selected for phase 3 studies are 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg. These doses are well justified based on 
the two phase 2 dose ranging study results.

evening, for 12 weeks. The 12-week treatment period was followed by a 7-day single-blind placebo run-out, 
after which subjects could enter the 9-month extension study 303.

limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm disorder, rapid eye movement (REM) 
behaviour disorder, narcolepsy, subjects with MMSE score <25, caffeine consumption ≥ 600 mg per day or 
any caffeine consumption after 4 pm and heavy tobacco use. 
Subject treated with central nervous system-active drugs were excluded; cognitive behavioural therapy was 
allowed if started at least 1 month prior to the run-in PSG nights and continued throughout the study. 
Treatments 
In study 301, daridorexant tablets were provided at strengths of 25 mg and 50 mg. In study 302, 
daridorexant tablets strengths was 10 mg and 25 mg. The treatment was administered orally, once daily in 
the evening during the DB treatment period (12 weeks). At the site, 1 tablet of study treatment was taken at 
least 2 h after the last meal and 30±5min before lights off, in the evening of each PSG night. At home, study 
treatment was taken at bedtime to mimic real life drug intake habits. 
Daridorexant matching placebo was administered in the evening during the single-blind run-in period (13–24 
days), the DB treatment period (84 ± 2 days) and the single-blind run-out period (7+ 2 days). 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of daridorexant, at 25 mg and 50 mg in study 301 and at 
10 mg and 25 mg in study 302, on objective sleep parameters in subjects with insomnia disorder. Secondary 
objectives were also the same in both pivotal studies and were to evaluate the efficacy daridorexant on 
subjective sleep parameters and daytime functioning in subjects with insomnia disorder. 
Safety objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of daridorexant in subjects with insomnia disorder 
during treatment and upon treatment discontinuation.

•  Change from baseline to Month 1 and Month 3 in the IDSIQ mood and alert/cognition domain scores, 
IDSIQ total score, evening VAS for ability to function and daytime alertness, to further characterize 
daytime functioning, 
•  Change from baseline to Month 1 and Month 3 in ISI© score. 
PHARMACOKINETICS: Daridorexant plasma concentrations, measured 9–10 h post-dose (morning after the 
second PSG night at Visits 6 and 8), or in the event of excessive sleepiness based on the investigator’s 
opinion. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subject were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to daridorexant 25 mg, 50 mg, and placebo in study 301 and in a 
1:1:1 ratio to daridorexant 10 mg, 25 mg, and placebo in study 302. In both studies, treatment allocation 
was stratified by age into 2 categories: < 65 and ≥ 65 years. It was planned that approximately 40% of 
subjects would be elderly (≥ 65 years old), with approximately 5% of these elderly subjects above 75 years 
old.  
During placebo run-in and run-out periods, placebo treatment was administered in a single-blind fashion. 
Subjects remained blinded to their study treatment until the unblinding of the ID-078A303 extension study. 
From randomization until EODBT, the study was performed in a DB fashion.  
Statistical methods 
The analysis were performed using the Full analysis set. 
For WASO, LPS, and sTST, the difference compared to placebo in the mean change from baseline to Month 1 
and Month 3 (± the assumed standard deviation [SD]per treatment group), was assumed to be 15 (±40) 
min, 15 (±40) min, and 20 (±54) min, respectively (based on Phase 2 data from studies AC-078A201 and 
AC-078A202). The corresponding effect size (mean/SD) was approximately 0.37.  
For IDSIQ sleepiness domain score, the difference compared to placebo in the mean change from baseline to 
Month 1 and Month 3 (± the assumed SD per treatment group) was assumed to be 5 (±5) (based on data 
from study AC-078A203). The corresponding effect size (mean/SD) was approximately 1.  
For study 301, based on a two-sample z-test, at least 900 subjects randomized to 50 mg daridorexant, 25 
mg daridorexant, and placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.e., 300 per group) provided at least 90% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.37 for testing 9 independent null hypotheses. This accounts for the Bonferroni correction. 
For study 302, based on a two-sample z-test, at least 900 subjects randomized to 25 mg daridorexant, 10 
mg daridorexant, and placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.e., 300 per group) provided at least 90% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.37 for testing 9 independent null hypotheses. This accounts for the Bonferroni correction.

IDSIQ scores 
IDSIQ total score ranging from 0 to 140 include sleepiness domain (ranging from 0 to 40) alert/cognition 
domain score (ranging from 0 to 60), and mood domain score (ranging from 0 to 40). 
At baseline, mean IDSIQ total scores ranged between 73.1 and 75.1 across treatment groups of both studies, 
approximately at the mid-point of the 140-point scale. Both at Month 1 and Month 3, differences to placebo 
were in favor of daridorexant at all doses. The LS mean difference to placebo at month 1 and month 3 are 
higher in the daridorexant 50 mg arm (-7.2 [-10.5; -3.9] at month 3) compared to the 25 mg arm (-3.5 [-
6.8; -0.1] at month 3 in study 301).  
At baseline, mean IDSIQ alert /cognition domain ranged between 31.7 and 32.5 across treatment groups of 
both studies, approximately at the mid-point of the 60-point scale. Both at Month 1 and Month 3, differences 
to placebo were in favor of daridorexant at all doses. The LS mean difference to placebo at month 1 and 
month 3 are higher in the daridorexant 50 mg arm (-2.5 [-3.9; -1.1] at month 3) compared to the 25 mg 
arm (-0.9 [-2.3; 0.5] at month 3 in study 301).  
At baseline, mean IDSIQ mood domain ranged between 19.1 and 19.8 across treatment groups of both 
studies, approximately at the mid-point of the 40-point scale. Both at Month 1 and Month 3, differences to 
placebo were in favor of daridorexant at all doses. The LS mean difference to placebo at month 1 and month

3 is higher in the daridorexant 50 mg arm (-2.8 [-3.8; -1.7] at month 3) compared to the 25 mg arm (-1.6 [-
2.6; -0.5] at month 3 in study 301).  
Exploratory endpoints 
Visual analog scales 
As part of the SDQ, 5 VAS scores collected daily information on the quality of sleep, depth of sleep, morning 
sleepiness (all assessed in the morning: morning VAS), as well as daytime alertness and daily ability to function 
(both assessed in the evening: evening VAS). The VAS scores were answered on a continuous bipolar scale 
ranging from 0–100 points, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome. 
Observed  results  on  VAS  scores  are  consistent  with  the  effects  observed  on  the  other  endpoints.  An 
improvement of sleep quality and daytime functioning is observed with daridorexant 50 mg but also at 25 mg 
compared to placebo. The LS mean difference to placebo is higher with the 50 mg dose compared to the 25 
mg dose.  
Insomnia Severity Index© score 
The proportion of subjects with an ISI© score < 10 at the end of the study was higher in daridorexant 50mg 
group (about 35% at month 3) compared to the placebo groups (about 24% at month 3). The proportion of 
subjects with an ISI© score < 10 in daridorexant 25 mg was about 20%.  
The proportion of subjects with a decrease in ISI© score of ≥ 6 points from baseline was higher in daridorexant 
50  mg  group  (56.5%  at  month  3)  compared  to  the  placebo  groups  (46%  at  month  3).  The  proportion  of 
subjects with an ISI© score of ≥ 6 points from baseline in daridorexant 25 mg was about 50% at month 3. 
Difference between daridorexant doses is low with a slight higher proportion with the 50 mg dose. Effect on 
ISI score observed at month 1 is increased at month 3.

Sleep architecture 
PSG assessments done at baseline, Month 1 and Month 3 evaluated the effect of treatment on sleep architecture 
in the pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
The percentage of rapid eye movement in relation to TST did not change with  daridorexant treatment when 
compared to baseline.  
Ancillary analyses 
In the individual studies, subgroup analyses were performed by age (< 65; ≥ 65 years), sex (male; female), 
and region (US; other).  
An additional post-hoc subgroup analysis by region (Europe; other) at Month 1 and Month 3 was performed for 
the 2 studies separately. “Europe” included subjects enrolled in sites from Denmark, Germany, Poland, Spain 
and Switzerland (study 301) and Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, and 
Sweden (study 302). 
There is no apparent difference of the results depending on the sex, age or region observed in study 301 or in 
study 302.  
For the pooled FAS, pre-planned subgroups of interest included age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years, and < 75 years 
vs ≥ 75 years), sex (male/female), region (US vs other ), ethnicity (White vs Black/African American vs others), 
and BMI (> 30 kg/m2 vs ≤ 30 kg/m2). No difference is observed.

The study protocol comprised a core study, and a patient preferences sub-
study (PAUSe). The core study consisted of a Screening phase with a 
screening period and placebo run-in period (20-31 days), a DB treatment 
phase (84 days), and a safety follow-up phase (30 days). Subjects who 
completed study treatment (DB treatment and placebo run-out treatment) in 
the core study were eligible to enter an extension study, ID-078A303 that 
was conducted at all study sites in the USA and Germany. At site visits (prior 
to PSG nights), study treatment (placebo run-in, DB, or placebo run-out 
treatment) was administered at least 2 h after the evening meal and 
approximately 30 min before lights off. At home, study treatment was taken 
at bedtime.

Analysis 
description 
Secondary analysis 
Please refer to respective sections in the AR 
Multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, three doses, 40-week 
extension to studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302 to assess the long-term safety and tolerability 
of ACT-541468 in adult and elderly subjects with insomnia disorder. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
The main inclusion criteria was completion of the DB study treatment and placebo run-out period of 301 or 
302 (Visit 1). 
Main exclusion criteria are unstable medical condition, significant medical disorder or acute illness, or ECG, C-
SSRS©, hematology or biochemistry test results in 301 or 302 study, which, in the opinion of the investigator, 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 96/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could affect the subject’s safety or interfere with the study assessments (Visit 1). Patients with positive urine 
drug  test  for  benzodiazepines,  barbiturates,  cannabinoids,  opiates,  amphetamines  or  cocaine  (Visit  1)  were 
also excluded.  
Treatments 
Subjects  who  were  assigned  to  a  daridorexant  arm  in  studies  301  and  302  were  assigned  to  the  same 
daridorexant dose, 10 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg, in study ID-078A303 (abbreviated to 303), while subjects assigned 
to the placebo arm in studies 301 and 302 were re-randomized to receive either placebo or 25 mg daridorexant 
in a 1:1 ratio in the extension study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of 10, 25 and 50 mg daridorexant. 
Efficacy  of  10  mg,  25  mg,  and  50  mg  daridorexant  on  subjective  sleep  parameters  (using  a  sleep  diary 
questionnaire [SDQ]) and daytime functioning (using the dedicated Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts 
Questionnaire [IDSIQ]) in subjects with insomnia disorder during long-term treatment was exploratory. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
• Change from baseline over time in sTST, in (sLSO), in (sWASO) 
•  Change  from  baseline  over  time  in  IDSIQ  scores  (i.e.,  total  score;  alert/cognition,  mood  and  sleepiness 
domain scores), on the SDQ VAS (mm) 
• Change from baseline to Visit 3 (Week 14), Visit 4 (Week 27), and Visit 5 (Week 40) in Insomnia Severity 
Index© (ISI©) scores. 
• Number (%) of subjects with ≥ 6-point decrease in ISI© total score from baseline to Visit 3 (Week 14), Visit 
4 (Week 27), and Visit 5 (Week 40). 
• Change from baseline over time in mean number of self-reported awakenings.  
• Change from baseline over time in Patient Global Assessment of Disease Severity (PGA-S) scores (daytime 
symptoms). 
• Change from baseline over time in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scores (daytime symptoms). 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
As  the  extension  study  is  an  extension  of  the  ID-078A301  and  ID-078A302  Phase  3  studies,  there  are  no 
statistical sample size considerations. It is expected that approximately 1260 subjects (i.e., ~70% of the total 
subjects in the combined pivotal studies) will enter the extension study. 
The study is performed in a DB fashion. The subjects, the investigator and site personnel, and the monitors 
remain  blinded  to  the  study  treatment  until  the  end  of  the  ID-078A303  extension  study.  Until  the  time  of 
unblinding for ID-078A303 final data analysis, the randomization lists of studies ID-078A301 and ID-078A302 
(and thus, also ID-078A303) are kept strictly confidential.

Statistical methods 
As the 303 study was an extension of the 301 and 302 Phase 3 studies, there were no statistical sample size 
considerations. Approximately 1260 subjects (approx. 70% of the total number of subjects randomized in the 
confirmatory studies 301 and 302) were anticipated to enter the long-term extension study 303, assuming 
that all sites from the confirmatory studies participated in the study. 
The final analysis was conducted as planned, when all subjects who did not prematurely discontinue study 
treatment had reached Week 44 (Visit 7, end of study). 
Results 
804 subjects consented to participate and were randomized (142 [10 mg], 270 [25 mg], 137 [50 mg], 128 
[placebo], and 127 [ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg]). 
801 subjects (99.6%) started DB treatment; 3 subjects discontinued from the study prior to starting DB 
treatment due to withdrawal by the subject (2 subjects, daridorexant 25 mg), and randomization in violation 
of an exclusion criterion (positive urine drug test at Visit 1; 1 subject, ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg). 
559 of the 804 randomized subjects (69.5%) completed the study (EOS visit); 245 discontinued the study 
prematurely. 550 subjects (68.4% of randomized subjects) completed DB treatment (Week 40, 
corresponding to 52 weeks of cumulative treatment); 251 (31.2%) prematurely discontinued DB treatment. 
The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation from DB treatment was lack of efficacy (11.9% 
overall), which was at least twice as frequent in the placebo group (22.7%) compared to any other treatment 
group (10.6%, 10.7% and 9.5% in the daridorexant 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg groups, respectively, and 
7.9% in the ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg group). 
Demographic characteristics (at screening in the respective confirmatory study) for subjects enrolled into the 
extension study were overall balanced across treatment groups and similar to the baseline characteristics of 
the whole populations recruited into the 301 and 302 studies.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analysis and meta-analysis) 
Data from the same treatment groups that are common across the two pivotal Phase 3 studies ID-078A301 
and ID-078A302 are pooled. Together, these studies contain efficacy data for 25 mg of ACT-541468 (in terms 
of number of subjects and extent of exposure) in a randomized placebo-controlled setting. 
The pooled analysis were performed on the primary, secondary and ‘other’ endpoints. 
Results from pooled analysis are presented with pivotal studies results.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  2  pivotal  phase  3  studies  (301  and  302)  were  both  large,  multinational,  multi-center,  double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week studies including both adult and elderly subjects with 
insomnia disorders. The recommended daily dose (50 mg) is only assessed in one pivotal study.  
The design and duration of phase 3 studies are in accordance with the Guideline on medicinal products for the 
treatment of insomnia: double-blind, randomised, parallel group trials with placebo of 12 week duration. The 
note for guidance recommended at least 2 to 4 week duration for the short term study. The patient numbers 
of around 1850 included and around 830 elderly patients are also well adapted. However the recommendation 
of an active comparator arm in at least one of the phase 3 studies as stated by the EMA guideline on clinical 
investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of insomnia was not followed by the Applicant. However 
the addition of zolpidem as an active comparator in one of the pivotal studies during the first 4 weeks would 
have complicated results interpretation and make them unsuitable for inclusion in the primary analysis. Also, 
one phase 2 study (201) includes zolpidem as active comparator for validation assay.  
The population intended to be included in the pivotal trials is insomnia patients according to DSM-V (18th May 
2013) criteria. These criteria include predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, 
associated with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or early morning awakening with inability to return to 
sleep. The sleep disturbance induces clinically significant distress or impairment in social or other important 
areas of functioning. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week and is present for at least 3 months, 
and  it  occurs  despite  adequate  opportunity  for  sleep.  The  insomnia  is  not  attributable  to  the  physiological 
effects of a substance (e.g., drug abuse, medication). 
Furthermore, to be included patients needed to present with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ≥15. The validated 
Insomnia  Severity  Index  (ISI)  is  a  brief  self-report  instrument  measuring  the  patient's  perception  of  both 
nocturnal and diurnal symptoms of insomnia and has been validated in the past (Bastien CH, Validation of the 
Insomnia Severity Index as an outcome measure for insomnia research. Sleep Med 2001;2:297-307). A total 
score  ≥15 correspond to moderate to severe  insomnia. A total  score  equal  or  higher  than 22  correspond to 
severe insomnia.  
The EMA guideline (2011) recommends to start the development of a medicinal product in adults in primary 
insomnia to establish efficacy and safety and only later to focus on secondary insomnia in addition to primary 
insomnia. However, there is no longer distinction between primary and secondary insomnia according to DSM-
V criteria and ICSD-3.  
Subjects  with  insomnia  associated  with  major  comorbidities,  including  sleep  related  breathing  disorder  and 
acute or unstable  psychiatric disorders (e.g.,  depression, anxiety  or  dementia),  were  excluded  according  to 
exclusion criteria. Central nervous system-active drugs should be discontinued for 5 half-lives of the respective 
drug  (but  at  least  2  weeks)  prior  to  Visit  1.  Overall  the  population  is  composed  preferentially  of  primary 
insomnia since only a low percentage of patients with psychiatric co morbidity were studied.  
The ability of daridorexant to treat insomnia and the impact on daytime functioning was evaluated using both 
objective and subjective efficacy parameters.  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 101/141 
 
 
 
 
Co-primary endpoints are objective measures are: WASO and LPS. As already mentioned for phase 2 studies 
(same endpoints), WASO represents duration in minutes of awakenings. LPS measures the time in minutes to 
sleep onset. 
The applicant did not follow the EMA guideline that recommended to establish efficacy on clinically relevant 
improvements on subjective sleep parameters of the patients in their natural setting and that results should 
be supported by objective data. The Applicant chose to do so to comply with FDA requirements.   
The  expected  treatment  effect  compared  to  placebo  for  primary  endpoints  WASO  and  LPS  (15  minutes 
decrease)  and  sTST  secondary  endpoint  (20  min  increase)  could  be  considered  as  relatively  small  gain  as 
compared  to  the  placebo  response.  The  corresponding  effect  size  (mean/SD)  was  approximately  0.37 
corresponding  to  a  small  to  medium  effect  size.  It  is  well  known  that  there  is  an  important  placebo  effect 
insomnia treatment.  The Applicant had to further justify why the choice of these differences for WASO, LPS 
and sTST reflect a clear clinical benefit for patients presenting with insomnia.  
For IDSIQ sleepiness domain score (ranging from 0 to 40), the difference compared to placebo in the mean 
change  from  baseline  to  Month  1  and  Month  3  was  assumed  to  be  5  (±5)  (based  on  data  from  study  AC-
078A203). The corresponding effect size (mean/SD) was approximately 1 which is a large effect size.  
The sample size was appropriately justified. The randomisation was balanced across the 3 treatment arms and 
within the two planned stratification levels (patients < 65 years and ≥ 65 years). Missing data were adequately 
managed. The overall type-one error was adequately controlled. 
Long term efficacy and safety study 
Long term efficacy and safety at the three doses 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg is assessed as part of study 303 
that  remain  in  DB  fashion.  After  a  7-day  single-blind  placebo  run-out,  subjects  could  enter  the  9-month 
extension study and placebo patients were re-randomized either to 25 mg dose or placebo. Final report of this 
extension study was submitted during the assessment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The analysis were performed using the Full analysis set, which is consistent with the intent-to-treat principle. 
Population randomized was 930 patients in study 301 and 924 patients in study 302 and well balanced between 
treatment arms. Data from both studies were pooled for the 25 mg dose and placebo.  
There  was  a  large  number  of  non-eligible  patients  in  the  pivotal  trials  with  a  potential  impact  on  the 
generalizability of pivotal study results. 
The rate of patients completing the double-blind treatment period was high with more than 90% of randomized 
patients in each arms of the two phase 3 studies  including in the placebo arm. Main reasons for premature 
discontinuation of double blind treatment were adverse events (between 1% and 2.3% in each arms), lack of 
efficacy (between 1.3% and 1.9% in each arms) or withdrawal by subject (between 1.3% and 4.2%). No clear 
difference on reason for premature discontinuation is observed between arms including with the placebo arms. 
Patient mean age at screening was around 55 years (age range between 18 and 88 years in study 301 and 
between  19  and  85  years  in  study  302)  and  39%  in  each  arms  were  higher  than  65  years  reflecting  the 
predominantly  old  target  population.  The  high  percentage  of  patients  higher  than  65  years  is  appreciated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 102/141 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethnicity  was  well  balanced  with  around  90%  Caucasians  in  each  arm  of  both  studies.  About  two  thirds  of 
recruited subjects were female corresponding to the epidemiology of the disease. Mean BMI at screening was 
high (around 26 kg/m2) with most patients obese (around 18%) or overweight (around 40%).  Few patients 
with psychiatric comorbidities (between 6 % and 8 % depending on the study) such as depression and anxiety 
were included.  
Insomnia severity at baseline assessed by ISI score is the same in each arm of both studies and was around 
19  (moderate  insomnia)  ranging  between  2  and  28  in  study  301  and  between  5  and  28  in  study  302). 
Percentage of patients with severe insomnia (ISI score ≥ 22) was well balanced between arms and was around 
30% in each arm. The mean time since insomnia diagnosis is more than 10 years. The applicant did describe 
the type of insomnia disorders: characterized mainly by difficulty to falling asleep, or maintaining or waking up 
early in the morning; with or without reduced sleeping time and with or without psychiatric comorbidity. 
Objective duration of wake after sleep onset (WASO) at baseline is around 100 minutes on average per night 
and slightly higher in study 302 compared to  study  301. Latency to  sleep onset (LSO) is around 1 hour on 
average. Subjective sleeping duration assessed by sTST is also well balanced between arms and studies, and 
around 5 hours per night. Although insomnia severity is not formally  defined by total sleep duration, WASO 
duration and LSP duration, insomnia patient characteristics at baseline support insomnia severity as assessed 
by ISI score.  
For the primary endpoint WASO, the decrease as compared to placebo is statistically significant at 50 mg at 
month 1 and month 3 in study 301 and at 25 mg in both studies (301 and 302). The decrease of wake after 
sleep onset (WASO) compared to placebo is higher with 50 mg per day (-22.8 [-28.0; -17.6] min and -18.3 [-
23.9; -12.7] min at Month 1 and Month 3) compared to the 25 mg dose (study 301: -12.2 [-17.4; -7.0] min 
and -11.9 [-17.5; -6.2] min at Month 1 and Month 3; study 302: -11.6 [-17.6; -5.6] min and -10.3 [-17.0; -
5.6] min at month 1 and month 3). The effect is maintained at 3 months. Responder analysis on WASO was 
provided as part of D120 answers to LoQ. For the higher value of the responder threshold (-30 min), 49.5% of 
treated patients in the 50 mg group (study 301) are considered as responders with 37.5% of responders in 
placebo groups (p=0.0041). 
For the primary endpoint LPS, the decrease is statistically significant at 50 mg at month 1 and month 3 in study 
301. The decrease is not statistically significant at 25 mg in study 302 and is statistically significant in study 
301. In study 301, the decrease of LPS compared to placebo is higher with 50 mg per day (-11.4 [-16.0;-6.7] 
min and - 11.7 min [-16.3; -7.0] at Month 1 and Month 3) compared to the 25 mg dose (-8.3 [-13.0; -3.6] 
min and -7.6 [-12.3; -2.9] min at Month 1 and Month 3). Based on the responders definition for LPS provided 
by  the  Applicant  at  month  3,  for  the  higher  value  of  the  responder  threshold  (-25  min),  56.1%  of  treated 
patients in the 50 mg group (study 301) are considered as responders with 45.2% of responders in placebo 
groups (p=0.0096) (please see Q129). 
With regard to the assumed difference compared to placebo in the mean change from baseline for WASO (-15 
min) and LPS (- 15 min), and the confidence intervals of the mean difference to placebo at 25 mg for these 
endpoints,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  25  mg  dose  is  questionable.  The  results  for  the  50  mg  dose  seem 
clinically relevant. The assumed difference compared to placebo in the mean change from baseline for WASO 
(-15 min) and LPS (- 15 min) was further discussed and can be considered as acceptable.  
LPS log-transformed analysis is consistent with analysis performed on raw LPS values.  
For the subjective secondary endpoint sTST, the increase of sleep duration is statistically significant at 25 mg 
and 50 mg at month 1 and month 3. The increase compared to placebo at 50 mg is 22.1 [14.4; 29.7] and 19.8 
[10.6; 28.9] at Month 1 and Month 3. The increase compared to placebo at 25 mg is 12.6 [5.0; 20.3] min and

With regard to the assumed difference compared to placebo in the mean change from baseline for this endpoint 
(-20 min) and the confidence intervals of the mean difference to placebo at 25 mg at month 1 and month 3 in 
study 301, the clinical relevance  of the 25  mg  dose is questionable. The results with 50 mg seem  clinically 
relevant.  
The Applicant provided responders analysis on sTST with a minimum change in sTST of clinical importance at 
an individual level of 55 minutes. 48.4% of treated patients in the 50 mg group are considered as responders 
based  on  this  definition  with  36.7%  of  responders  in  placebo  groups.  In  the  25  mg  dose  group,  41.1%  of 
patients treated are considered as responders in both studies that is close to placebo. 
For  the  subjective  secondary  endpoint  IDSIQ  sleepiness  domain  score,  the  subjective  effect  on  daytime 
sleepiness is statistically significant versus placebo only at 50 mg at month 1 and month 3. The mean difference 
to placebo at 50 mg is -1.8 [-2.5;-1] and -1.9 [-2.9;-0.9] at month 1 and month 3. The effect observed at 
month 1 seems maintained at month 3. With regard to the assumed difference compared to placebo in the 
mean change from baseline for this endpoint (-5 points) and the confidence intervals of the mean difference to 
placebo at 50 mg, the clinical relevance is questionable.  
The Applicant provided responder analysis on  IDSIQ  sleepiness domain  with a 4 points or 8 points change. 
Taking into account the 0-40 scale, the 8 points change could be considered as particularly clinically relevant. 
In study 301, at the 50 mg dose at 3 month, 37% of treated patients reported at least 8 points decrease at 3 
months compared to 24.0% of responders in the placebo group. In the same study, the percentage of subjects 
showing a decrease from baseline at Month 3 of at least 4 points was 52.9% in the daridorexant 50 mg group, 
50.0% in the 25 mg group and 44.4% in the placebo group. The impact on daytime functioning assessed by 
IDSIQ scores is supported by results observed on VAS daytime alertness and on VAS on ability to function. 
Same trend of improvement is observed through these tools leading to a positive impact of daridorexant at 50 
mg per day on daytime functioning. 
The multiplicity testing procedure set up in both trials for the formal statistical demonstration of efficacy was 
rigorously applied by the Applicant. In study 301, 25 mg and 50 mg doses have achieved efficacy objectives 
for the primary and key secondary endpoints at month 1 and 3, except for IDSIQ at 25 mg. In study 302, none 
of the tested dose (10 mg and 25 mg) has formally demonstrated its efficacy.  
In conclusion, 50 mg dose can be validated as clearly efficient dose. The 25 mg dose used in both phase 3 
trials  failed  to  demonstrate  consistent  and  robust  efficacy  results  from  statistical  point  of  view  on  primary 
efficacy parameters.  
For  the  main  other  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  TST  (objective  sleep  duration),  significant  differences  are 
observed at 50 mg and at 25 mg in both studies at month 1 and month 3. The difference to placebo at 50 mg 
is 33.4 [26.3; 40.4] at month 1 and 28.6 [21.5; 35.8] at month 3. The difference to placebo at 25 mg is 20.6 
[13.5; 27.7] at month 1 and 18.4 [11.2; 25.5] at month 3 in study 301; 17.7 [10.2; 25.2] at month 1 and 
17.4 [9.2; 25,5] at month 3 in study 302. The effect is similar at 1 month and 3 months, and thus maintained. 
The improvement of TST at all daridorexant doses compared to placebo is lower when assessed subjectively 
by the patient compared to objective assessment. At the 50 mg dose, the improvement of TST compared to 
placebo is about 20 minutes when assessed subjectively and around 30 minutes when assessed objectively. 
However  the  results  on  responders  for  sTST  confirm  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect:  48.4%  of  treated 
patients in the 50 mg group have a minimum change in sTST of clinical importance at an individual level of 55 
minutes compared to 36.75% in placebo groups.

For the assessment of awakenings duration reported by the patient (sWASO), the mean improvement compared 
to baseline at 50 mg is -23.1 [-27.6; -18.5] min at month 1 (mean difference to placebo  -7.1 [-13.5, -0.7] 
min) and -28.8 [-33.9; -23.7] min at month 3 (mean difference to placebo -4.8 [-11.9, -2.4] min). The effect 
increasing with the dose observed for objective WASO is no longer observed with subjective WASO. 
Regarding the assessment of latency to sleep onset by the patient (sLSO), the mean improvement compared 
to baseline at 50 mg is -15.3 [-18.5; -12.1] min at month 1 (mean difference to placebo  -7.8 [-12.3, -3.3] 
min) and -18.3 [-31.8; -14.6] min at month 3 (mean difference to placebo -6.5 [-11.6, -1.4] min). No clear 
difference of the effect between doses is observed. 
The patient complaints which are assessed by subjective measures (sTST, sWASO, sLSO) are important points 
to  consider  in  insomnia.  The  values  of  subjective  measures  are  lower  with  daridorexant  than  the  objective 
values.  This  was  discussed  by  the  Applicant  during  the  assessment.  There  is  a  weak  correlation  of  the 
parameters  which  may  be  explained  by  the  different  in  nature  and  collection  methods  of  objective  and 
subjective endpoints. 
In exploratory endpoints, the Applicant proposed a responders analysis based on ISI improvement 
corresponding to insomnia severity. Patients were considered as responders if their ISI change score relative 
to baseline was greater than 6. The analysis is also performed with patients with ISI score < 10 
corresponding to none or mild insomnia. The proportion of subjects with an ISI© score < 10 at the end of the 
study was higher in daridorexant 50mg group (about 35% at month 3) compared to the placebo groups 
(about 24% at month 3). The proportion in daridorexant 25 mg group was about 20%. The proportion of 
subjects with a decrease in ISI© score of ≥ 6 points from baseline was higher in daridorexant 50 mg group 
(56.5% at month 3) compared to the placebo groups (46% at month 3). The proportion in daridorexant 25 
mg group was about 50% at month 3. Difference between daridorexant doses is low with a slight higher 
proportion with the 50 mg dose. This responder analysis was completed with a post hoc analysis according to 
the responder definition from Morin et al. (JAMA, 2009) which confirm the benefit of daridorexant 50 mg 
compared to placebo (please see Q131).  
Daridorexant does not seem to have an impact on sleep architecture in humans based on polysomnography 
data as well as in animals as reported in preclinical data.  
Results of pooled analysis at the 25 mg dose are consistent with the results observed at 25 mg in each pivotal 
study.  
In the individual studies, subgroup analyses were performed by age (< 65; ≥ 65 years), sex and region (US; 
other).  An  additional  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis  by  region  (Europe;  other)  at  Month  1  and  Month  3  was 
performed for the 2 studies separately. For the pooled data, subgroups of interest included age (< 65 years vs 
≥ 65 years, and < 75 years vs ≥ 75 years) and BMI (> 30 kg/m2 vs ≤ 30 kg/m2).  
Results by subgroups for primary (WASO, LPS) and secondary endpoints (sTST, IDSIQ sleepiness domain 
score) were consistent with the overall results. There is no apparent difference depending on the sex, age or 
region. In all demographic subgroups, the 50 mg dose provided a larger benefit than the 25 mg dose across 
almost all endpoints.  
It appears that 50 mg daridorexant performs slightly better in elderly subjects (> 65 years) compared to adults 
for the WASO, LPS, sTST and IDSIQ sleepiness domain score.  
The Applicant included approximately 40% of patients ≥ 65 years (364/930 in study 301 and 363/925 in study 
302) in the pivotal Phase 3 studies that could be considered acceptable overall. There are around 100 patients 
older than 75 years (54/930 in study 301 and 56/925 in study 302). However there are almost no patient older 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 105/141 
 
 
 
than 85 years (3/930 in study 301 and 1/925 in study 302). Data on patients older than 75 years at 50 mg 
(19  patients and 11 patients in phase  2 study)  are  limited. The Applicant further discussed the benefit risk 
balance at 50 mg in patients older than 75 years and advantage of a lower dose/ Based on data analysis over 
the full age range, the higher efficacy of the 50 mg dose on primary and secondary endpoints in patients aged 
from  65 to 75 years is considered as demonstrated  and seems maintained in patients older than 75 years. 
Although there is no risk signal in elderly population at this time, caution should be used in this population.  
Additional subgroups analysis was provided according to ISI score at baseline (patients with moderate insomnia 
and  patients  with  severe  insomnia),  predominant  type  of  insomnia  at  baseline  (difficulty  to  falling  asleep, 
maintaining or waking up early in the morning; insomnia with or without reduced sleeping time), patients with 
psychiatric co-morbidity at baseline.  
Long term efficacy and safety study 
The  long  term  extension  study  assessing  daridorexant  10  mg,  25  mg  and  50  mg  doses  is  completed.  This 
extension study also includes a placebo arm. The main objective was the assessment of long term safety. 559 
of  the  804  randomized  subjects  (69.5%)  completed  the  study  (EOS  visit);  245  discontinued  the  study 
prematurely. 550 subjects (68.4% of randomized subjects) completed DB treatment (Week 40, corresponding 
to 52 weeks of cumulative treatment); 251 (31.2%) prematurely discontinued DB treatment.  
Efficacy endpoints are explorative and assessed by subjective endpoints (sTST, IDSIQ scores, sLSO, sWASO). 
Baseline values are those from the beginning of pivotal studies. Subjects assigned to a daridorexant arm in the 
301 or 302 study were assigned to the same daridorexant dose. Subjects assigned to the placebo arm in the 
301 or 302 studies  were re-randomized to receive either placebo or 25 mg  daridorexant in a 1:1 ratio. The 
blind was maintained between pivotal and extension studies.  
In the placebo arm, patients were already on placebo in phase 3 study. As these patients accepted to continue 
the treatment in study 303, they can be considered as good responders under placebo. This could explained 
the higher values for sTST, sWASO and sLSO reported with placebo compared to the values for same endpoints 
observed with placebo in the phase of 3 month pivotal studies.  
As for patients treated with placebo, patients treated with daridorexant at all doses who accepted to continue 
in the extension study were satisfied by the treatment. This could explained high values at 10 mg especially 
for sLSO and sWASO.  
There is no efficacy decrease on sTST endpoint at 1 year. The within-patient LS mean difference from baseline 
at 50 mg was 57.7 min [51.2; 64.2] at month 3 in study 301. At 1 year the LS mean difference from baseline 
is  maintained  in  patients  receiving  the  50  mg  and  even  a  bit  increased  to  75.1  min  [62.7;  87.6].  When 
compared  to  the  placebo,  the  50  mg  dose  treatment  effect  is  also  maintained  between  3  and  12  months 
treatment  and  is  close  to  the  20  minutes  treatment  effect  targeted  in  the  trial.  The  LS  mean  difference  to 
placebo is 19.8 min at 3 months versus 17.8 at 12 months. The effect on IDSIQ score are also maintained. 
Regarding the importance of sWASO and sLSO as subjective endpoints compared to sTST, please see question 
121. sTST can be considered as a good subjective endpoint.  
The efficacy of daridorexant 50 mg can be considered as maintained at 1 year. 
Overall, to be noticed that patients treated with daridorexant 50 mg sleep more than 6 hours per night, with a 
sleep latency of around 30 minutes and have less than 1 hour of awakenings during the night. An important 
Assessment report

placebo effect on subjective endpoints (sTST, sLSO, sWASO) is observed for patients treated with placebo in 
the long term study.  
The initially proposed indication for daridorexant was “the treatment of adult patients with insomnia to improve 
sleep and daytime functioning”.  
The CHMP considered that the indication should reflect the characteristic of chronic insomnia and so mentioned 
insomnia duration (at least 3 months) and the impact on daytime functioning to allow clear characterisation of 
the patients who could be treated with daridorexant. The indication was agreed to be “the treatment of adult 
patients with insomnia characterised by symptoms present for at least 3 months and considerable impact on 
daytime functioning”. 
The  applicant  was  requested  to  present  the  results  of  these  two  outcomes  “to  improve  sleep  and  daytime 
functioning” in SmPC section 5.1.  
To inform prescribers on insomnia severity of patients included in pivotal studies, insomnia severity according 
to ISI score at baseline was also mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The Applicant recommended dosing regimen is one tablet of 50 mg once per night in adults and elderly, taken 
orally in the evening within 30 minutes before going to bed. The recommended dose in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment or using moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is one tablet of 25 mg once per night.  
The  indication  does not  indicate  a time  limit  for  treatment.  A  discussion  was  requested on  limitation of  the 
treatment duration, stopping rules and inclusion in the SmPC. Chronic insomnia is defined in ICSD-III and DSM-
5.  Both  definitions  defines  a  patient  with  chronic  insomnia  disorders  as  patient  who  experiences  sleep 
disturbances for the last  three months, corresponding to patients included in pivotal studies.  The treatment 
efficacy improves until 3 months and efficacy seems maintained on the long term up to 12 months without 
safety signal on long term use. Thereby the CHMP agreed that no specific treatment duration can be mentioned 
in  the  SmPC.  Nevertheless,  the  appropriateness  of  continuing  the  treatment  should  be  reassessed  within  3 
months and the treatment should be as short as possible. Also, as there is no risk of withdrawal or rebound 
effect,  treatment  can  be  stopped  without  specific  stopping  rules.  The  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  Quviviq 
(daridorexant) in the intended indication is based on data from 2 pivotal phase 3 studies versus placebo (study 
301 and study 302), supported by the interim results from one ongoing DB Phase 3 extension study (study 
303), and two Phase 2 dose-finding studies one in adult subjects versus placebo with an active arm (zolpidem) 
(study 201) and one cross-over versus placebo in elderly (study 202).  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The statistically significant and clinical relevant difference over placebo is achieved for the 2 primary objective 
endpoints (WASO, LPS) at 50 mg in one of the 2 pivotal study since this dose was studied in only one pivotal 
study. Although it would have been appreciated to confirm the data observed at the 50 mg dose in another 
pivotal  study  with  the  same  dose,  the  results  of  the  2  studies  remain  supportive.  Objective  endpoints  are 
supported  by  subjective  endpoints,  although  to  a  lesser  extent.  Efficacy  could  be  considered  statistically 
demonstrated to decrease wake after sleep onset, latency to persistent sleep and increase of total sleep time 
over 3 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 107/141 
 
 
 
 
The  analysis  of  responders  defined  as  patients  with  minimum  change  in  sTST  of  clinical  importance  at  an 
individual level of 55 minutes support the clinical relevance of the effect. A clinical relevance of the effect is 
also observed at 50 mg with the responder analysis for WASO, LPS and ISI score.  
The responder analysis on IDSIQ sleepiness domain with  a 4 points or 8 points change were provided.  The 
results are not impressive. However, the impact on daytime functioning assessed by IDSIQ scores is supported 
by results observed on VAS daytime alertness and on VAS on ability to function. Same trend of improvement 
is observed through these tools that could confirm the positive impact of  daridorexant at 50 mg per day on 
daytime functioning. 
Statistically significant difference over placebo is achieved for the 2 primary endpoints (WASO, LPS) at 25 mg 
in study 301 and not achieved for one of the primary endpoint (LPS) at 25 mg in study 302. The efficacy of 10 
mg dose is not demonstrated.  
Maintenance of the effect is assessed as part of the long term extension study 303. The effect on subjective 
endpoints seems maintained at 1 year for daridorexant 50 mg.  
From the efficacy perspective, the clinical development adequately supports the proposed indication at 50 mg. 
Available data could support the use of the 25 mg dose, when in judgement of the clinician a lower dose than 
50 mg could be appropriate, for example in patients already treated with CNS depressant. 
A  discussion  was  requested  on  limitation  of  the  treatment  duration.  If  it  could  be  agreed  to  not  specify  a 
maximum treatment duration, the treatment should be as short as possible and appropriateness of continued 
treatment should be reassessed  within  3 months. Also, as there is no  risk  of  withdrawal  or  rebound effect, 
treatment can be stopped without specific stopping rules. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The  main  focus  of  the  safety  analysis  for  daridorexant  is  based  on  placebo  controlled  safety  data  from  the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies of 3-month duration, i.e., the two individual studies 301 (daridorexant 25 and 50 mg, 
and placebo) and 302 (daridorexant 10 and 25 mg, and placebo).  
The safety data from the long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled extension study 303 were also assessed. 
Study 303 was ongoing at the time of submission; therefore, interim data are provided initially. At the time of 
the  interim  cut-off  (22  July  2020),  all  subjects  who  were  included  to  study  303  without  prematurely 
discontinuation had completed at least 6 months of double-blind daridorexant treatment overall (i.e., 3 months 
in study 301 or 302, and 3 months in study 303); a subset of subjects had been treated for 9 months: 473 
subjects (67.3%) or 12 months: 314 subjects (46.7%) of the 303 treated cohort. 
A pre-planned pooled safety data set of daridorexant 25 mg and placebo groups was also used, since these 
two groups were the only treatment groups replicated across studies 301 and 302. This pooled safety analysis 
was used to compare the rates of AEs within subgroups and to compare withdrawal symptoms in the 25 mg 
group vs placebo. 
In addition, safety data from Phase 2 studies in subjects with insomnia (studies 201 and 202, as well as study 
206  performed  in  Japanese  subjects)  were  also  considered.  Furthermore,  data  from  18  Phase  1  clinical 
pharmacology  studies  are  presented,  particularly  those  studies  that  assessed  special  populations  (insomnia 
subjects with hepatic or renal impairment and with respiratory disease) or with addressed specific safety topics 
Assessment report

Page 108/141 
 
 
 
 
(human abuse potential and potential negative effects on driving performance for example), and safety  data 
related to higher doses (up to 200 mg). 
Of note, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had slight impact on study 115 and 117 that were put on hold. 
In study 117 (Thorough QT study), 1 subject discontinued due to the need to quarantine following a visit to a 
COVID-19 risk region; in study 115 (renal impairment study), 1 subject was not enrolled due to the ongoing 
situation. 
The overall development program is considered adequate for the intended treatment in subjects with insomnia. 
Patient exposure 
The overall exposure during the double-blind treatment period in subjects with insomnia in the completed Phase 
2 and 3 studies, and up to the cut-off date for the interim analysis of study 303 is shown in Table 3 below. 
A total of 1655 subjects with insomnia in phase 2 and phase 3 studies including the ongoing phase 3 study 
received at least one dose of daridorexant all doses combined, and 729 subjects received at least one dose of 
placebo. Of these 1655 subjects, 804 subjects received 25 mg, 369 subjects received 50 mg and 364 subjects 
received 10 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 109/141 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical pharmacology program for  daridorexant  consisted  of  18 completed Phase  1 trials (567 subjects 
exposed to daridorexant), including single and repeated dose studies. Of these 567 subjects, 194 were exposed 
to single doses of daridorexant (up to 200 mg) and 373 received multiple doses of  daridorexant (up to 100 
mg). 
Due to the prevalence of insomnia in elderly, nearly 40% of subjects ≥ 65 years were recruited in the phase 2 
and 3 studies. Some other subgroup analyses were performed for the combined safety set in particular by sex, 
in which female subjects constituted two-thirds of the overall population, reflecting the higher prevalence of 
insomnia in females than in males. 
According  to  the  ICH  Topic  E  1  “Population  Exposure:  The  Extent  of  Population  Exposure  to  Assess  Clinical 
Safety”, it is anticipated that the total number of individuals treated with the investigational drug, including 
short-term exposure, will be about 1500. This recommendation is satisfied as from phase 2 and phase 3 studies, 
a total of 1655 subjects with insomnia received at least one dose of daridorexant, at any dose. 
Subjects from the phase 3 studies were exposed to 12 months of treatment to determine the long-term safety 
of daridorexant at doses of 25 or 50 mg, as recommended in the regulatory guidance [ICH 1995]. Regarding 
the safety database, 126 (10 mg), 122 (50 mg) and 335 (25 mg) patients had been exposed to daridorexant 
for at least 6 months, and 72 (10 mg), 83 (50 mg) and 159 (25 mg) subjects had been exposed for at least 1 
year.  This  represents  583  patients  exposed  for  at  least  6  months,  at  any  daridorexant  dose,  with  20%  of 
patients in the 50 mg group and 57% in the 25 mg group. For the one-year exposure, a total of 314 subjects 
were exposed to daridorexant, at any dose, with 26% of patients in the 50 mg group and 50% in the 25 mg 
group.  
Adverse events 
The collection of AEs were coded to MedDRA PTs. In the individual pivotal Phase 3 studies and in the pooled 
safety analysis, TEAEs  were defined as AEs occurring  or worsening between the start of double-blind study 
treatment up to 30 days after the end of DB study treatment, or enrolment in the extension study 303.  
All  AE,  TEAE  whatever  the  study  period,  TEAE  related  to  study  treatment,  AE  leading  to  premature 
discontinuation or temporary interruption of treatment, TESAE, TESAE related to study treatment and TEAESI 
after ISB (Independent Safety Board) adjudication  were presented and discussed for the overall treatment-
emergent period, as well as for the double-blind treatment period, the placebo run-out and the follow-up period. 
The incidence of AEs was explored in the pooled safety data set across the following subgroups: Age group (< 
65 years, ≥ 65 years and < 75 years, ≥ 75 years); Sex (male / female); BMI (low [< 25 kg/m2], middle [≥ 25 
– ≤ 30 kg/m2], and high [> 30 kg/m2]); Ethnicity (White / Black or African American) and Region (US / non-
US). 
Based on the mechanism of action of daridorexant, the potential for narcolepsy-like symptoms was carefully 
considered  and  narcolepsy-like  symptoms  monitored  during  the  daridorexant  clinical  program.  The  use  of 
hypnotics may increase the risk of suicidality and self-injury (McCall 2017). These risks were adjudicated by 
the ISB as potential AESIs. Overall, from the nonclinical and clinical program, no off-target effect was identified. 
Specifically, from a non-clinical aspect, off-target risk is not considered relevant for human for daridorexant as 
well as for its major human metabolites.

Based on information with other products commonly used in insomnia, additional safety topics of importance 
were identified and thoroughly assessed: 1) next-morning residual effects, 2) risks associated with driving, 3) 
daytime  somnolence  and other  CNS-depressant  effects,  4)  falls,  accidents  and  injuries,  5)  anxiety,  6)  drug 
abuse potential, 7) overdose (accidental/intentional), 8) withdrawal symptoms and 9) rebound insomnia. 
Regarding the overview of AE, in the Phase 3 studies 301 and 302, the percentage of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs was numerically slightly higher in the daridorexant treatment groups compared to the placebo groups 
(by 41.3% vs 37.2% in study 301 and 43.1% vs 36.3% in study 302) with however a similar incidence in the 
daridorexant groups of each study.  
On the contrary, the rate of treatment-emergent SAEs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation during the DB study 
period, was slightly higher in the placebo groups compared to the daridorexant treatment groups. Indeed, the 
rates of treatment-emergent SAEs are 0.6% and 1% in all  daridorexant groups whereas it is slightly higher 
(1.3% and 2.3%) in the placebo groups of both studies. The rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation is 2.3% 
and 3.2% in the placebo groups whereas it is slightly lower (1.0%, 1.3%, 2.0% or 2.3%) in the daridorexant 
groups of both studies. The rate of Treatment-emergent AESI is overall higher in the daridorexant groups (10 
mg,  25  mg  and  50  mg)  compared  to  the  placebo  groups  for  both  studies.  However  no  trend  for  a  dose 
dependence  is  highlighted  as  the  incidence  rate  in  the  50  mg  group  (0.6%)  for  study  301  is  similar  to  the 
incidence rate in the 10 mg group (0.7%) for study 302, and lesser to the incidence rate in 25  mg groups of 
both studies (1.3% and 2.3%). One treatment-emergent SAE with fatal outcome in study 301 was not related 
to study drug (see dedicated section “deaths”). 
For study 303, a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs was observed in the daridorexant groups compared to the 
placebo group however not carried out by any specific PT, except for nasopharyngitis which was more frequent 
in the 50 mg group and the ex-placebo / 25 mg group compared to any other groups. Nevertheless, regarding 
the mechanism of action of daridorexant, nasopharyngitis is not expected to be related to the study treatment. 
Two treatment-emergent not drug related SAEs with fatal outcome were observed in study 303 (see dedicated 
section “deaths”). 
Overall, a trend for a dose dependence in the incidence of AE is uncertain. 
Regarding the TEAE, the three most commonly reported primary SOCs were infections and infestations, nervous 
system disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders, in both phase 3 studies 301 and 302. 
Nasopharyngitis  and  headache  were  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs,  with  quite  similar  rates  in 
daridorexant compared to the placebo groups. Fatigue was numerically more frequent in daridorexant groups 
compared to placebo in both studies, which could be expected regarding the mechanism of action (antagonism 
of the orexin receptors). However, no clear dose-related increase was observed for somnolence regarding the 
comparative rates between the different daridorexant groups and the placebo groups of both studies (either 
the highest rate is observed for the 25 mg dose and not the 50 mg dose or the rate is equivalent with the 
placebo rate). Same remark can be made for dizziness, even if less obvious numerically. 
For the accidental overdose, the highest rate is 2.6% for daridorexant 50 mg although no dose dependence is 
particularly highlighted (the rate in the placebo group of 1.6% is higher than the rate in the 25 mg group). 
Same trend for nausea (2.3%) without any consistent dose dependence. 
In the 301 study, falls were reported more frequently in the placebo group in 8 subjects (2.6%) than in either 
daridorexant group in 1 subject (0.3%) in each. In study 302, the events of falls were balanced and consistent 
across treatment groups: 3 subjects (1%) in placebo group vs 7 subjects in each daridorexant 10 mg and 25 
mg group (1.3% and 1%) respectively. There seems to be no dose dependence for the events of fall. None of 
the cases of fall occurred during the night. Cases of falls were systematically sent for adjudication as a potential 
AESI and none were finally considered as AESIs.

Overall, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, falls, and accidental overdoses are discussed in more details as AESI, 
as they are of special significance given the indication. 
The pattern of TEAEs during the 9-month long-term extension study (up to the interim cut-off) was similar to 
the  observations  on  studies  301  and  302.  No  specific  safety  signal  appeared  during  the  long-term  study 
regarding the safety of daridorexant. The most commonly reported TEAE was nasopharyngitis. TEAEs with an 
incidence of ≥ 2% in any treatment group and reported more frequently for daridorexant than placebo (≥1% 
difference)  included  nasopharyngitis  (8.0%  in  the  daridorexant  50  mg  group),  somnolence  (2.9%  in  the 
daridorexant 50 mg group), accidental overdose, urinary tract infection (2.8% each, in the daridorexant 10 mg 
group),  and  less  frequent  cough,  tonsillitis,  pneumonia,  fall,  hepatic  enzyme  increased  and  myalgia. 
Specifically, the incidence of somnolence was very low in the placebo, 10 mg, 25 mg and ex-placebo/25 mg 
daridorexant groups (0%, 0%, and 0.7% and 0.8% respectively) compared to the 50 mg group (2.9%). The 
high rate of incidence of this AE in the 50 mg group (2.9%) compared to the other treatment groups (placebo, 
10 mg, 25 mg and ex-placebo/daridorexant groups with 0%, 0%, and 0.7% and 0.8% respectively) of study 
303 have been clarified by the Applicant. 
TEAEs  of  fall  were  reported  with  a quite  similar  rate  in  the  daridorexant  groups,  slightly  higher  than  in  the 
placebo group. None of the falls occurred during the night or was reported as an AESI. 
For the phase 2 studies, the TEAE profile was similar to the observations on studies 301, 302 and 303. It could 
however  be  noted  that  the  AE  gait  disturbance  occurred  in  6  subjects,  1  subject  in  placebo,  2  subjects  on 
daridorexant 5 mg, and 1 subject each on daridorexant 10, 25 and 50 mg which resolved before leaving the 
study center. No dose-dependence emerge for this AE regarding its consistent distribution amid the treatment 
groups.  A  few  isolated  cases  (7)  of  gait  disturbance  occurred  in  both  studies  301  and  302  without  being 
considered clinically significant and resolved without treatment. 
Overall, no new safety signal appeared during these phase 2 studies regarding the safety of daridorexant as 
compared to pivotal studies. 
Adverse Events considered drug related are displayed in the table below: 
The majority of ADRs (headache, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue and nausea) were mild to moderate in intensity 
and no evidence of a dose-relationship for the frequency or the severity of ADRs is observed. Sleep paralysis 
(transient, dissociated sleep state during which REM sleep atonia continues into wakeful consciousness) were 
observed with daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg at a frequency lesser than 1% (0.5% for 25 mg and 0.3% for 
50 mg) and no case observed with placebo. Cases of sleep-related hallucinations were only observed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 112/141 
 
 
 
 
 
daridorexant 25 mg group in 0.8% of subjects and no case with placebo or daridorexant 50 mg. In the SmPC, 
the frequency of sleep-related hallucinations is reported at a frequency of 0.6%. The Applicant has provided 
justification for these observations and these AE are classified as “uncommon” in the SmPC. 
Regarding the severity of TEAE, a majority of TEAEs reported during the studies 301 and 302 were of mild or 
moderate intensity. A low rate of TEAE were of severe intensity, around 1% to 2% in the  daridorexant and 
placebo groups. TEAEs of severe intensity were reported with a frequency similar or even higher in the placebo 
groups than in the daridorexant groups. Most of the AEs of severe intensity were also reported as SAEs and/or 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Moreover, the cases of mixed hallucination, sleep paralysis and suicidal ideation in studies 301 and 302 are 
scrutinized and discussed among the AESI. The same trend is observed during the Phase 3 extension study 
303. And no specific pattern of severity of TEAE is observed in the phase 2 or phase 1 studies. 
Regarding the AESI,  considering the mechanism of action  of  daridorexant  which  intends to  stimulate sleep-
promoting effects, special attention was given to several safety topics of medical significance. 
The  AESI  were  assessed  according  to  the  following  4  categories:  narcolepsy-like  symptoms  related  to  EDS 
(excessive  daytime  somnolence),  narcolepsy-like  symptoms  related  to  complex  sleep  behavior,  including 
hallucinations and sleep paralysis, narcolepsy-like symptoms related to cataplexy-like events and suicide/self-
injury (and worsening of depression). 
The other safety topics of  medical significance are next-morning  residual  effects; ability  to drive or operate 
machinery; daytime somnolence / CNS-depressant effects; falls, accidents and injuries, which may result from 
EDS; anxiety; drug abuse potential; cases of overdose; withdrawal symptoms; and rebound insomnia. It is to 
be noted that the ability to drive or operate machinery, drug abuse potential and withdrawal symptoms are 
safety topics assessed in the clinical pharmacology safety studies. 
Narcolepsy-like symptoms 
A total of 453 potential AESIs occurring in 367 subjects were submitted to the ISB for adjudication during the 
Phase 2 and 3 programs. Of these, 31 events (6.8%) in 24 subjects of submitted potential AEs were adjudicated 
by the ISB as AESIs.  
For the narcolepsy-like symptoms, three quarters (3/4) of the narcolepsy-like AESIs (15/20) occurred in the 
25 mg daridorexant groups (and 2 in the daridorexant 50 mg, 2 in the 10 mg daridorexant group and 1 in the 
placebo group) for both 301 and 302 studies.  
The majority of narcolepsy-like symptoms related to EDS and the narcolepsy-like symptoms related to complex 
sleep behaviour including hallucinations and sleep paralysis occurred in the 25 mg daridorexant groups without 
any clear trend for a dose  dependence. None of the  events  evoked a typical  narcolepsy phenotype  with an 
increase in sleep propensity and recurrence, for example. No hallucinations and sleep paralysis occurred in the 
placebo groups of both studies. Most AESIs were non-serious and required no intervention.  
Based on the evaluation of the 3 subcategories of “narcolepsy-like symptoms”, the main facts could be pointed 
out: 
- No AESIs belonging to the category “narcolepsy-like symptoms related to cataplexy” occurred in the Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies. Indeed, among the 6 cases of muscle weakness observed with high doses administered 
during the daytime in Phase 1 studies (2/8 subjects at 75 mg and 4/6 subjects at 200 mg), 1 case (at 200 mg) 
was considered to be possibly a cataplexy-like event which could be explained by the high daridorexant dose 
of 200 mg. All the more that in phase 1 studies it was highlighted that the duration of AEs related to depression 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 113/141 
 
 
 
of the CNS showed a trend to an increase with dose, in particular above 50 mg. In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, 
muscle weakness was reported for 1 subject at 10 mg and 1 subject at 25 mg in study 302 only. 
- The total number of AESIs belonging to the category “narcolepsy-like symptoms related to EDS” was rather 
low: in total, 13/1597 subjects in studies 201, 301, 302, and 303 combined treated with daridorexant (0.8%), 
in  comparison  to  2/675  subjects  (0.3%)  treated  with  placebo.  In  study  301,  this  AESI  was  quite  similarly 
distributed across treatment groups: 2 (25 mg), 1 (50 mg), and 1 (placebo). In study 302, most EDS occurred 
in the 25 mg group: 1 (10 mg), 4 (25 mg), 1 (placebo). In study 303: only 1 subject (25 mg), out of 673 
treated  with  daridorexant  (0.2%)  with  no  case  reported  in  the  50  mg  group.  For  the  3  studies,  a  slight 
predominance of the AESI in the 25 mg group  is observed. One case of moderate somnolence in study 303 
required nearly 50 days of duration for the resolution of the event in a 57-year-old Caucasian female which is 
questionable. The Applicant has justified this rather long time (50 days) before resolution of the event and no 
specific pattern is raised from this observation. 
- Seven cases (5 in 25 mg, 2 in 50 mg) of sleep paralysis and/or hallucinations, with a low incidence rate (< 
1%), were reported in subjects who received daridorexant in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. One subject presents 
3 events of intermittent sleep paralysis, occurring on different days, and each lasting approximately 1.5 min 
(study  301:  50  mg),  and  1  other  subject  presents  3  events  of  abnormal  dreams  (study  303:  50  mg).  The 
reported cases of sleep paralysis and/or hallucinations occurred independently of any symptoms suggestive of 
narcolepsy. No dose dependency was observed.  
Apart from sleep paralysis and hallucinations, no cases of other complex sleep behaviours such as sleep walking 
/  somnambulism,  sleep  driving,  sleep  talking,  sleep  eating,  or  sleep  sex  were  reported  in  the  50  mg 
daridorexant group. The Applicant has explained the highest incidence of this AESI in the 25 mg daridorexant 
group in comparison to the other groups and to the incidence in the general population. The Applicant has also 
justified  the  less  frequent  incidence  of  these  AESI,  sleep  paralysis  and/or  hallucinations,  in  the  long-term 
extension study than in the 3-month pivotal studies. 
Suicide/self-injury 
AESIs  denoting  suicide  /  self-injury  were  assessed  based  on  a)  reported  TEAEs  pertaining  to  suicide  /  self-
injury and b) findings of suicidal ideation and/or behaviour on the C-SSRS. 
A total of 8 cases of suicide / self-injury were noted across the Phase 1 to 3 studies: 7 in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies, and 1 in Phase 1 study (HAP study 107). 
The AEs of suicidal ideation in Phase 3 studies were reported in 4 isolated cases, 2 in study 302 and 2 in study 
303, equally distributed across daridorexant treatment and placebo groups (1 subject in each treatment group 
:  10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg and placebo). All events reported with  daridorexant occurred  in subjects with pre-
existing psychiatric disorders known to be associated with high suicidal risk (paranoid schizophrenia undeclared 
at screening in 1 subject, who should not have been randomized; depression in the other subject, stable and 
asymptomatic at screening) and/or acute difficult circumstances (family stress, financial stress, illicit drug use). 
In addition, there was 1 case of suicidal ideation detected on the C-SSRS in study 201 (on 5 mg), which was 
mistakenly not reported as an AE. The Applicant has provided the narrative and justified the lack of adjudication 
as an AESI. Based on the C-SSRS scores assessment of the individual cases, there was no evidence of increased 
risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour during treatment with daridorexant, as well as no dose-dependent trend, 
however this potential risk need to be followed in the RMP. 
In the SmPC, there is a precaution for use in the SmPC in accordance with these observations: “As with other 
hypnotics, QUVIVIQ should be administered with caution in patients exhibiting symptoms of depression” as “In 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 114/141 
 
 
 
primarily depressed patients treated with hypnotics, worsening of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions 
have been reported”. This precaution for use is in accordance with these observations. 
Depression/worsening of depression 
There were 4 TEAEs of depression in study 301, 5 events in study 302 and 5 events in study 303 in subjects 
receiving daridorexant. They were balanced across treatment groups within each study and did not occur in 
patients with a medical history of depression. The majority of AEs were non-serious except 3 events (2 in study 
301 and 1 in study 303) of depression each in the placebo group. 
A medical history within the psychiatric disorders SOC was reported in a total of 54 subjects (approximately 
6%)  in  study  301  and  63  subjects  (approximately  7%)  in  study  302.  No  AEs  pertaining  to  depression  or 
worsening of depression occurred in these subjects. 
In summary, the number of AEs denoting depression was rather low and balanced between treatment groups 
and study periods (run-in, double blind and run-out periods). There was no evidence of depression or worsening 
of depression during treatment with daridorexant, in particular in subjects with a medical history of psychiatric 
disorders, including depression. However, this risk is followed as an important potential risk in the RMP under 
the  safety  concern  “Suicidal  behaviour  in  high-risk  patients  (with  a  medical  history  of  depression  or  other 
psychiatric disorders)”. 
Next-morning residual effects 
In parallel to improve sleep through the daridorexant treatment, it is important for the subjects not to present 
next-morning residual effects from the treatment. Therefore, assessing the risk of increased morning sleepiness 
with the use of a drug that induce sleep is a major issue of its safety.  
The Morning Sleepiness VAS scores improved (morning sleepiness was decreased) as early as Day 1 following 
the start of treatment until at least Month 3, with a larger dose-dependent improvement in the daridorexant 
treatment groups compared to placebo, revealing a lack of signal of next-morning residual somnolence under 
treatment.  The  beneficial  effect  of  daridorexant  on  morning  sleepiness  seems  to  be  maintained  over  three 
months of time. When assessing the next-morning residual effects through other validated methods (coding 
sub-test, neurological examination, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), the same trend is observed. 
Overall,  the  various  assessments  did  not  reveal  any  propensity  of  a  next-morning  residual  effect.  On  the 
contrary, it was shown that the morning sleepiness, which could also be a consequence of insomnia, improved 
on daridorexant treatment, according to the results of the daily morning sleepiness VAS. 
Ability to drive or operate machinery 
The driving performance seems not significantly impaired after a few days of daridorexant treatment although 
slightly  impaired  at  the  beginning  of  the  treatment.  Clarifications  have  been  provided  regarding  the 
methodology of the study. Concerning the SmPC, caution are stated in sections 4.4 and 4.7. 
Daytime somnolence / CNS-depressant effects 
In studies 301 and 302, the observed changes in ESS total score from baseline to the last value during the 
double-blind  treatment  period  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups,  indicating  no  trend  in  excessive 
daytime sleepiness linked to treatment. 
In parallel to a positive impact of daridorexant in daytime sleepiness (IDSIQ, see clinical efficacy part of the 
AR),  it  was  also  important  to  examine  the  TEAEs  of  somnolence  and  CNS-depressant  effects.  The  overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 115/141 
 
 
 
incidence rate of TEAEs pertaining to CNS-depressant effects in the 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg groups remained 
low (2.3%, 3.6%, and 1.6%, respectively) compared to 2.1% in the placebo group. 
Both  MedDRA  searches  have  shown  a  slightly  increased  incidence  of  events  for  daridorexant  compared  to 
placebo, with the highest incidence for 25 mg. The main CNS-depressant AE is somnolence (22/26 subjects in 
301 and 20/22 in 302) with no observed dose dependence (the incidence rate in the 50 mg group is similar or 
even smaller than in the placebo group).  
Overall, fatigue and somnolence are the most frequent CNS-depressant AE, of mild or moderate intensity, in 
the  daridorexant  groups.  These  AE  are  could  be  expected  regarding  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the  DORA 
(antagonism of the orexin receptors, stimulation of sleep-promoting effects). 
Accidents and injuries (including falls) 
In the individual pivotal studies 301 and 302, there was a consistently lower or similar incidence rate of TEAEs 
pertaining to accidents and injuries including falls in the daridorexant groups compared to the placebo group.  
In the long-term study 303, the rates of TEAEs of falls, accidents and injuries in the different groups, were 
comparable. The rate in the 50 mg group even tended to be lower than in any other group. 
The  3  cases of  treatment-emergent  road  traffic  accidents  reported  were  all  due  to  external  factors  and  not 
related to the study drug. 
More than half of falls occurred in elderly (aged ≥ 65 years). There were external contributing factors for each 
case  and  none  was  treatment  related.  There  was  no  evidence  of  any  CNS-depressant  effects,  such  as 
somnolence or impaired attention, reported for any subject reporting accidents (including the road traffic ones), 
or injuries with or without falls. No falls occurred during the night. 
Overall, there was no evidence of any drug effect or dose dependence as there was no evidence of any CNS-
depressant effect that may have caused the reported falls, accidents or injuries AEs following treatment with 
daridorexant. None of the falls was considered as AESIs, which could exclude a signal for cataplexy. The addition 
of a caution in elderly is added in the SmPC, similarly to other hypnotics . 
Anxiety symptoms 
There was no evidence of any causal relationship between daridorexant treatment and anxiety. 
Drug abuse potential 
An abuse potential for daridorexant was observed as compared to placebo and seems comparable to that of 
suvorexant (150 mg), and zolpidem (30 mg) at supratherapeutic doses (100 mg and 150 mg). The analysis of 
data from phase 3 studies did not permit to confirm the abuse risk of daridorexant for the target population of 
patients  with  insomnia  under  experimental  conditions.  In  conclusion,  the  mechanism  of  action,  the 
pharmacological and safety data are relevant enough to constitute substantial evidence of potential for abuse 
of daridorexant. The Applicant’s proposal to add “drug abuse” safety concern as important potential risk on the 
RMP is supported. The warning in section 4.4 has been amended. 
Overdose 
A total of 44 subjects reported AE of overdose during the double-blind treatment periods of the Phase 3 studies, 
of whom 35/44 were reported as accidental overdose, referring to taking 1 additional tablet on 1 or more than 
1 occasion. Intentional overdose was reported in 2 subjects on placebo in study 302 and was asymptomatic.  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 116/141 
 
 
 
All AEs of accidental overdose were non-serious, mild and asymptomatic except for 2 cases: 1 subject in study 
301, in the 25 mg group, who reported AEs of disturbance in attention and hypersomnia during the placebo 
run-out period, and 1 subject in study 302, in the 25 mg group, who reported AE of mixed hallucination and 
sleep paralysis during the DB treatment period (this case has already been discussed among the narcolepsy-
like symptoms). Nearly half of the overdose AE (19/44) were reported during the placebo run-in period (10 
events, including an intentional overdose in study 302) and the placebo run-out period (9 events) in studies 
301 and 302. No clear reason is provided for these cases of overdose in the placebo groups, and the lack of 
efficacy could be supposed. 
There is no specific antidote for daridorexant. In the event of an overdose, symptomatic and supportive medical 
care should be provided, and subjects should be carefully monitored, as appropriate. Dialysis is unlikely to be 
effective as daridorexant is highly protein-bound. 
Overall, these data did not raise any specific concern across all studies.  
Withdrawal symptoms 
Overall  assessment  of  withdrawal  effects  showed  no  evidence  of  a  withdrawal  syndrome  after  daridorexant 
treatment abrupt discontinuation, regardless of the dose.  
In 301, 303 and pool safety data, no AEs indicating a withdrawal syndrome were observed while significant 
higher  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  symptom  BWSQ  item  scored  as  severe  (>20)  at  the  end  of 
treatment withdrawal period in the daridorexant group was observed as compared to placebo (respectively, 
5.6% and 2.8%).  
The Applicant was asked to (1) provide the list of AEs indicating a withdrawal syndrome used, (2) provide the 
frequency  of  each  BWSQ  symptom  scored  as  severe  (>20),  and  (3)  compare  AEs  to  BWSQ  symptoms. 
According to submitted data, the raised issues were solved. 
Rebound insomnia 
Compared to baseline, there was no mean increase in WASO, LPS or decrease in sTST in any treatment group. 
Overall, based on the change from baseline to the run-out period in objective (WASO and LPS) and subjective 
(sTST)  sleep  parameters,  no  evidence  of  rebound  insomnia  was  observed.  Moreover,  no  AEs  suggesting 
rebound insomnia or exacerbated insomnia were reported during the placebo run-out period of both DB studies 
301 and 302. 
Rebound insomnia after 12 months of treatment was also assessed based on the change in sTST from baseline 
to the placebo run-out period in study 303 for those subjects who had already completed the placebo run-out 
period. The observations were similar to those obtained after studies 301 and 302. There was also no sign of 
rebound insomnia following a 12-month treatment with daridorexant, whatever the dose. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
In studies 301 and 302, a total of 22 SAE occurred. In both daridorexant treatment groups, the incidence of 
SAE  were  numerically  higher  in  the  placebo  groups  than  in  each  daridorexant  groups:  2  subjects  in  the 
daridorexant 25 mg group (0.6%), 3 subjects in the daridorexant 50 mg group (1.0%), and 7 subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 117/141 
 
 
 
 
placebo group (2.3%) for study 301; 3 subjects in the daridorexant 10 mg group (1.0%), 3 in the daridorexant 
25 mg group (1.0%), and 4 in the placebo group (1.3%) for study 302. 
All SAE in studies 301 and 302, except one in study 302, were assessed as not related to study treatment. 
According to the analysis of the narratives, this position is endorsed, except for the SAE considered as related. 
Indeed,  the  case  of  microvascular  coronary  artery  disease  for  a  60-70-year-old  female  subject  (with  many 
comorbidities in daridorexant 10 mg group considered as related to study treatment although not resolved at 
EOS after treatment discontinuation) has probably been erroneously considered related to daridorexant 10 mg. 
For both studies, each SAE PT was reported for 1 subject only, except for 2 cases of syncope and 2 cases of 
depression in the placebo groups. No trend in relation to a system organ class was thus identified. 
Among the 22  SAE  for  both  studies,  two  SAE  led  to  study  discontinuation  in  study  302:  the one  in  subject 
discussed above and the other in a subject within the context of “worsening of paranoid schizophrenia”. This 
last discontinuation is justified, all the more that an AESI of suicidal ideation was also reported for this subject. 
In  study  303,  three  cases  of  diverticulitis  (25  and  50  mg),  two  confusional  state  (25  and 50  mg),  and two 
myocardial infarctions (10 and 25 mg) were reported in various daridorexant treatment groups vs no case in 
the  placebo  group.  Otherwise,  each  SAE  was  reported  for  1  subject  only,  mostly  in  the  25  mg  and  50  mg 
daridorexant groups 
Among the 27 SAEs mainly reported as not related to study treatment, 2 cases were reported as related to the 
study  treatment.  Another  not  study  treatment  related  SAE  occurred  after  the  interim  cut-off  date  (22  July 
2020) in the daridorexant 10 mg group: The event was assessed as a “cerebrovascular accident” and finally 
categorized  as  “chronic  ischemic  changes”  in  a  70-80  year  old  female.  The  narrative  has  been  thoroughly 
assessed and this final categorization seems  appropriate and is endorsed. The lack of relation to treatment 
could be explained by the medical history and comorbidities of the subject. 
In  the  phase  2  study  201,  three  SAE  (2  cases  in  the  10  mg  daridorexant  group  and  1  case  in  the  50  mg 
daridorexant group) not related to study drug were reported. After assessment of the narrative for the minor 
septal myocardial infarction, the lack of treatment relation is considered appropriate regarding the pre-existing 
stenosis of the artery of the subject, but undetected at enrolment. For the other two subjects, the TESAE were 
obviously  not  treatment  related.  The  three  subjects  completed  the  study.  There  was  no  SAE  with  a  fatal 
outcome.  
No SAE was reported in study 202. 
During  the  phase  1  study  program,  two  SAE  in  the  50  mg  daridorexant  group  were  reported,  both  were 
considered as not related to study drug which is endorsed after assessment of their narratives. 
Overall, during the phase 1 to 3 studies, most SAE that occurred were not treatment related or erroneously 
treatment related, with various medical histories or comorbidities underlying the occurrence of the SAE. There 
was not specific pattern of any system organ class or PT that could be highlighted from these SAE in any study 
treatment group, even if numerically most of the SAE (mainly related to orthopaedic injuries, cardiovascular 
disorders, infectious situations or cancer events) occurred in the 25 mg and 50 mg daridorexant groups. A few 
SAE led to discontinuation, mainly in relation to comorbidities as not treatment related. None of these SAE led 
to death. 
Deaths 
A total of 4 deaths were reported during the development program of daridorexant, three of them during the 
301 and 303 studies and one non-treatment emergent SAE (metastatic lung cancer) at the end of study 303. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 118/141 
 
 
 
The 4 narratives have been extensively read, analyzed and summarized to keep the relevant information related 
to the deaths. 
None of these cases was considered related to study treatment which is endorsed. Indeed the deaths could be 
attributed to the subjects’ confounding pre-existing risk factors and comorbidities such as age  and relevant 
medical history.

Overall, marked abnormalities in haematology parameters without clinical significance were reported in similar 
proportions of subjects in the 3 treatment groups and  placebo of the phase  2 and 3 studies. No pattern of 
haematology  abnormalities  related  to  daridorexant  was  observed  with  no  consistent  treatment  or  dose-
dependent  trend  for  any  of  the  haematology  parameter.  No  SAE  related  to haematology  abnormalities  was 
reported. 
Chemistry 
Overall, marked abnormalities in clinical chemistry parameters without clinical significance  were reported in 
similar proportions of subjects in the 3 treatment groups and placebo of the phase 2 and 3 studies. No pattern 
of  chemistry  abnormalities  related  to  daridorexant  was  observed  with  no  consistent  treatment  or  dose-
dependent trend for any of the chemistry parameter. No SAE related to chemistry abnormalities was reported. 
Vital signs and ECG findings  
Vital signs 
Daridorexant did not have any clinically relevant effect on vital signs following its administration in any of the 
Phase 1–3 clinical studies. 
ECG findings 
For all ECG findings during double-blind period, no treatment or dose-related pattern was observed. And the 
incidence of marked ECG abnormalities during the phase 2 and 3 studies was comparable across treatment 
groups, with no consistent treatment or dose-related trend. There was no indication of any systematic effect 
when compared to placebo. This lack of concern is corroborated by the safety pharmacology TQT study . 
Safety in special populations 
The safety in special populations was mainly focused on a comparison of safety data (overall incidence of TEAE) 
in the elderly (≥ 65 years) compared to the younger adult (<65 years) subgroups, in male compared to female 
subjects. Indeed, taking into account the epidemiology of insomnia, subjects aged ≥ 65 years constituted nearly 
40% of the overall included population. Moreover, elderly subjects may be more sensitive to the AE of insomnia 
therapies than younger adults justifying that the pattern of AE between age groups was carefully scrutinized. 
According to the pooled data set, the overall incidences of TEAEs were higher in daridorexant dose groups than 
in placebo groups in both the < 65 years and  ≥ 65 years subgroups and the pattern of the most frequently

reported TEAE was consistent between the age subgroups. Although there were a few numerical differences 
regarding the incidence of the AE falls and dizziness between the age subgroups, both in the daridorexant and 
the placebo groups, there was no specific signal of increased incidence of falls or dizziness in the elderly treated 
with  daridorexant  vs  those  treated  with  placebo.  This  is  supported  by  a  lesser  incidence  rate  of  falls  and 
dizziness in the 50 mg  daridorexant  vs 25 mg for both AE.   Regarding the  AE  somnolence  and fatigue, the 
same trend is observed in the elderly vs adults, with a lesser incidence in the 50 mg daridorexant for both AE.  
Overall, for the most frequent AE of somnolence, dizziness, and fatigue, the incidence was slightly higher in 
the elderly at 25 mg compared to subjects < 65 years, this difference is however not seen in elderly subjects 
at 50 mg. In the SmPC, the following sentence is stated: ”The adverse reaction profile in elderly subjects was 
consistent with younger subjects”.  
The overall pattern of the most frequently reported TEAE was consistent between male and female subjects 
with no clear sex-associated effect  on the  incidence of  these  TEAE  in  the pooled  daridorexant  25 mg group 
compared to the pooled placebo group. 
Regarding  other  criteria,  there  is  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  TEAE  when  comparing  US  subjects  vs 
Europeans, low vs high BMI subjects and White vs Black or African American, although the small number of 
subjects in the Black or African American and other ethnic subgroups (around 10%) limits the ability to detect 
risk differences by ethnicity and limits the interpretation of the data. 
In summary, no trend of specific safety concern has been highlighted in special populations, considering the 
age, the sex, the ethnicity, the region and the BMI. There is a lack of data about the use of daridorexant during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In accordance with the data assessed in the AR, safety related to DDI and other interactions are mandatory 
and the following statement are displayed in the SmPC: 
-  Caution  should  be  exercised  when  prescribing  QUVIVIQ  concomitantly  with  CNS-depressant  medicinal 
products due to potentially additive effects, and a dose adjustment of either QUVIVIQ or the concomitant CNS 
depressants should be considered. 
- Patients should be cautioned about drinking alcohol during treatment with QUVIVIQ (see section 4.5). Co-
administration of 50 mg daridorexant with alcohol led to additive effects on psychomotor performance. 
- Concomitant use of QUVIVIQ with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 is not recommended and the MAH is asked to 
list them in the SmPC. 
- The consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice in the evening should be avoided. 
- Based on these results, concomitant use with a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducer substantially decreases 
exposure to QUVIVIQ, which may reduce efficacy

The statements in the SmPC of cautions when using daridorexant concomitantly with CNS-depressant medicinal 
products,  with  alcohol,  with  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  and  with  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A4  inducer  is 
endorsed and fully justified.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Sixty-nine  (69)  subjects  prematurely  discontinued  from  studies  301,  302  and  303.  Additional  9  subjects 
discontinued from phase 1 and phase 2 studies. A total of 76 discontinuations in phase 2 and phase 3 studies 
represents a rate of 4.5% of premature discontinuation which is rather low. 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 TEAE leading to premature discontinuation of studies 301 and 302 
was low (from 1.0 to 3.2%). There was no dose relationship and the incidence of these AEs was numerically 
higher in the placebo group than in either daridorexant group. 
In study 303, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an AE was higher than in pivotal 
studies in each daridorexant group or placebo group (3.7% for 25 mg, 6.6% for 50 mg and 4.7% for placebo) 
except in the daridorexant 10 mg group (0.7%). Although a higher rate of discontinuation could be explained 
by the longer treatment exposure, the low rate of discontinuation observed in the 10 mg daridorexant group 
may be due to a lower occurrence of AE in this low-dose group. 
Across the pivotal studies and the long-term extension study, most of the AE leading to discontinuation were 
reported in 1 subject. However, in terms of CNS effects, some AE were noted in more than 1 case and shared 
out between the treatment groups: there were 3 cases of dizziness (daridorexant 10 and 25 mg), 2 cases of 
syncope (placebo), 3 cases of suicidal ideation (daridorexant 10 and 50 mg, and placebo), 3 cases of fatigue 
(daridorexant  50  mg,  placebo  and  ex-placebo/daridorexant  25  mg),  2  cases  of  sedation  complication 
(daridorexant  25  mg  and  placebo)  and  2  cases  of  confusional  state  (daridorexant  25  and  50  mg).  No 
discontinuation for morning somnolence, sleepiness, or daytime somnolence was reported. 
No specific trend could be observed from these AE leading to discontinuation in any group as there was no dose 
relationship and the incidence of AE leading to discontinuation was numerically higher in the placebo groups of 
the pivotal studies than in the daridorexant groups.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  focus  of  the  safety  analysis  for  daridorexant  is  based  on  placebo  controlled  safety  data  from  the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies of 3-month duration, i.e., the two individual studies 301 (daridorexant 25 and 50 mg, 
and placebo) and 302 (daridorexant 10 and 25 mg, and placebo). The safety data from the long-term, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  extension  study  303  were  also  assessed.  Study  303  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of 
submission; therefore, interim data are provided initially. A pre-planned pooled safety data set of daridorexant 
25 mg and placebo groups was also used, since these two groups were the only treatment groups replicated 
across studies 301 and 302. This pooled safety analysis was used to compare the rates of AEs within subgroups 
and to compare withdrawal symptoms in the 25 mg group vs placebo. 
Assessment report

Page 121/141 
 
 
 
 
In addition, safety data from Phase 2 studies in subjects with insomnia (studies 201 and 202, as well as study 
206 performed in Japanese subjects) and from 18 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies are also considered.  
The overall development program is considered adequate for the intended treatment in subjects with insomnia. 
Exposure 
The overall exposure during the double-blind treatment period in subjects with insomnia in the completed Phase 
2 and 3 studies, and up to the cut-off date for the interim analysis of study 303 (22 July 2020) 
A total of 1655 subjects with insomnia in phase 2 and phase 3 studies including the ongoing phase 3 study 
received at least one dose of daridorexant all doses combined, and 729 subjects received at least one dose of 
placebo. Of these 1655 subjects, 804 subjects received 25 mg, 369 subjects received 50 mg and 364 subjects 
received 10 mg. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  daridorexant  consists  of  18  completed  Phase  1  trials  (567  subjects 
exposed to daridorexant), including single and repeated dose studies. Of these 567 subjects, 194 were exposed 
to single doses of daridorexant (up to 200 mg) and 373 received multiple doses of  daridorexant (up to 100 
mg). 
Due to the prevalence of insomnia in elderly, nearly 40% of subjects ≥ 65 years were recruited in the phase 2 
and 3 studies. Some other subgroup analyses were performed for the combined safety set in particular by sex, 
in which female subjects constituted two-thirds of the overall population, reflecting the higher prevalence of 
insomnia in females than in males. 
Safety profile 
Safety data are driven by the subjects with insomnia included in the phase 3 studies, including 40% elderly. 
Based on the mechanism of action of daridorexant, the potential for narcolepsy-like symptoms was carefully 
considered and narcolepsy-like symptoms monitored during the daridorexant clinical program.  
In the Phase 3 studies 301 and 302, the percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs was numerically slightly 
higher in the daridorexant treatment groups compared to the placebo groups (by 41.3% vs 37.2% in study 
301 and 43.1% vs 36.3% in study 302) with however a similar incidence in the  daridorexant groups of each 
study. For study 303, a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs was observed in the daridorexant groups compared 
to the placebo group however not carried out by any specific PT. 
On the contrary, the rate of treatment-emergent SAEs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation during the DB study 
period, was slightly higher in the placebo groups compared to the  daridorexant treatment groups. Overall, a 
trend for a dose dependence in the incidence of AE is uncertain. 
•  TEAE 
The three most commonly reported primary SOCs were infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, 
and gastrointestinal disorders, in both phase 3 studies 301 and 302. 
The majority of ADRs (headache, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue and nausea) were mild to moderate in intensity 
and no evidence of a dose-relationship for the frequency or the severity of ADRs is observed. Sleep paralysis 
(transient, dissociated sleep state during which REM sleep atonia continues into wakeful consciousness) were 
observed with daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg at a frequency lesser than 1% (0.5% for 25 mg and 0.3% for 
50 mg) and no case observed with placebo. Cases of sleep-related hallucinations were only observed in the 
daridorexant 25 mg group in 0.8% of subjects and no case with placebo or daridorexant 50 mg.

•  AESI 
Considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  daridorexant  which  intends  to  stimulate  sleep-promoting  effects, 
special attention was given to several safety topics of medical significance. 
The  AESI  were  assessed  according  to  the  following  4  categories:  narcolepsy-like  symptoms  related  to  EDS 
(excessive  daytime  somnolence),  narcolepsy-like  symptoms  related  to  complex  sleep  behavior,  including 
hallucinations and sleep paralysis, narcolepsy-like symptoms related to cataplexy-like events and suicide/self-
injury (and worsening of depression). 
The other safety topics of medical significance are next-morning  residual  effects; ability  to drive or operate 
machinery; daytime somnolence / CNS-depressant effects; falls, accidents and injuries, which may result from 
EDS; anxiety; drug abuse potential; cases of overdose; withdrawal symptoms; and rebound insomnia.  
Narcolepsy-like symptoms 
A total of 453 potential AESIs occurring in 367 subjects were submitted to the ISB for adjudication during the 
Phase 2 and 3 programs. Of these, 31 events (6.8%) in 24 subjects of submitted potential AEs were adjudicated 
by the ISB as AESIs.  
For the narcolepsy-like symptoms, three quarters (3/4) of the narcolepsy-like AESIs (15/20) occurred in the 
25 mg daridorexant groups (and 2 in the daridorexant 50 mg, 2 in the 10 mg daridorexant group and 1 in the 
placebo group) for both 301 and 302 studies.  
The majority of narcolepsy-like symptoms related to EDS and the narcolepsy-like symptoms related to complex 
sleep behaviour including hallucinations and sleep paralysis occurred in the 25 mg daridorexant groups (seven 
cases: 5 in 25 mg, 2 in 50 mg) with a low incidence rate (< 1%), without any clear trend for a dose dependence. 
None of the events evoked a typical narcolepsy phenotype with an increase in sleep propensity and recurrence, 
for example. No hallucinations and sleep paralysis occurred in the placebo groups of both studies. Most AESIs 
were non-serious and required no intervention.  
- No AESIs belonging to the category “narcolepsy-like symptoms related to cataplexy” occurred in the Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies. 
- The total number of AESIs belonging to the category “narcolepsy-like symptoms related to EDS” was rather 
low: in total, 13/1597 subjects in studies 201, 301, 302, and 303 combined treated with daridorexant (0.8%), 
in comparison to 2/675 subjects (0.3%) treated with placebo. For the 3 studies, a slight predominance of the 
AESI in the 25 mg group is observed. One case of moderate somnolence in study 303 required nearly 50 days 
of  duration  for  the  resolution  of  the  event  in  a  57-year-old  Caucasian  female  which  is  questionable.  The 
Applicant has justified this rather long time (50 days) before resolution of the event and no specific pattern is 
raised. 
Apart from sleep paralysis and hallucinations, no cases of other complex sleep behaviours such as sleep walking 
/  somnambulism,  sleep  driving,  sleep  talking,  sleep  eating,  or  sleep  sex  were  reported  in  the  50  mg 
daridorexant group. The Applicant has explained the highest incidence of this AESI in the 25 mg daridorexant 
group in comparison to the other groups and to the incidence in the general population. The Applicant has also 
justified  the  less  frequent  incidence  of  these  AESI,  sleep  paralysis  and/or  hallucinations,  in  the  long-term 
extension study than in the 3-month pivotal studies, with a statement in the SmPC that these events more 
often occur during the first weeks after treatment initiation. 
Suicide/self-injury 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 123/141 
 
 
 
AESIs  denoting  suicide  /  self-injury  were  assessed  based  on  a)  reported  TEAEs  pertaining  to  suicide  /  self-
injury and b) findings of suicidal ideation and/or behaviour on the C-SSRS. 
A total of 8 cases of suicide / self-injury were noted across the Phase 1 to 3 studies: 7 in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies, and 1 in Phase 1 study (HAP study 107). 
In summary, the AEs of suicidal ideation in Phase 3 studies were reported in 4 isolated cases, 2 in study 302 
and 2 in study 303, equally distributed across daridorexant treatment and placebo groups (1 subject in each 
treatment  group  :  10  mg,  25  mg,  50  mg  and  placebo).  All  events  reported  with  daridorexant  occurred  in 
subjects  with  pre-existing  psychiatric  disorders  known  to  be  associated  with  high  suicidal  risk  (paranoid 
schizophrenia undeclared at screening in 1 subject, who should not have been randomized; depression in the 
other  subject,  stable  and  asymptomatic  at  screening)  and/or  acute  difficult  circumstances  (family  stress, 
financial stress, illicit drug use). In addition, there was 1 case of suicidal ideation detected on the C-SSRS in 
study 201 (on 5 mg), which was mistakenly not reported as an AE. The Applicant has provided the narrative 
and justified the lack of adjudication as an AESI. Based on the C-SSRS scores assessment of the individual 
cases,  there  was  no  evidence  of  increased  risk  of  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  during  treatment  with 
daridorexant, as well as no dose-dependent trend, however this potential risk need to be followed in the RMP 
(see RMP part). 
In the SmPC, there is a precaution for use in the SmPC in accordance with these observations: “As with other 
hypnotics, QUVIVIQ should be administered with caution in patients exhibiting symptoms of depression” as “In 
primarily depressed patients treated with hypnotics, worsening of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions 
have been reported”. This precaution for use is in accordance with these observations. 
Depression/worsening of depression 
There were 4 TEAEs of depression in study 301, 5 events in study 302 and 5 events in study 303 in subjects 
receiving daridorexant. They were balanced across treatment groups within each study and did not occur in 
patients with a medical history of depression. The majority of AEs were non-serious except 3 events (2 in study 
301  and  1  in  study  303)  of  depression  each  in  the  placebo  group.  A  medical  history  within  the  psychiatric 
disorders  SOC  was  reported  in  a  total  of  54  subjects  (approximately  6%)  in  study  301  and  63  subjects 
(approximately 7%) in study 302. No AEs pertaining to depression or worsening of depression occurred in these 
subjects. 
In summary, the number of AEs denoting depression was rather low and balanced between treatment groups 
and study periods (run-in, double blind and run-out periods). There was no evidence of depression or worsening 
of depression during treatment with daridorexant, in particular in subjects with a medical history of psychiatric 
disorders, including depression. However, this risk is followed as an important potential risk in the RMP under 
the  safety  concern  “Suicidal  behaviour  in  high-risk  patients  (with  a  medical  history  of  depression  or  other 
psychiatric disorders)”. 
Next-morning residual effects 
In parallel to improve sleep through the daridorexant treatment, it is important for the subjects not to present 
next-morning residual effects from the treatment. Therefore, assessing the risk of increased morning sleepiness 
with the use of a drug that induce sleep is a major issue of its safety. Overall, the various assessments did not 
reveal  any  propensity  of  a  next-morning  residual  effect.  On  the  contrary,  it  was  shown  that  the  morning 
sleepiness, which could also be a consequence of insomnia, improved on daridorexant treatment, according to 
the results of the daily morning sleepiness VAS.

Ability to drive or operate machinery 
The driving performance seems not significantly impaired after a few days of daridorexant treatment although 
slightly  impaired  at  the  beginning  of  the  treatment.  Clarifications  have  been  provided  regarding  the 
methodology of the study. Concerning the SmPC, caution are stated in sections 4.4 and 4.7. 
Daytime somnolence / CNS-depressant effects 
In studies 301 and 302, the observed changes in ESS total score from baseline to the last value during the 
double-blind  treatment  period  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups,  indicating  no  trend  in  excessive 
daytime sleepiness linked to treatment. In parallel to a positive impact of daridorexant in daytime sleepiness 
(IDSIQ, see clinical efficacy part of the AR), it was also important to examine the TEAEs  of somnolence and 
CNS-depressant effects. The overall incidence rate of TEAEs pertaining to CNS-depressant effects in the 10 mg, 
25  mg,  and  50  mg  groups  remained  low  (2.3%,  3.6%,  and  1.6%,  respectively)  compared  to  2.1%  in  the 
placebo group. 
Overall, fatigue and somnolence are the most frequent CNS-depressant AE, of mild or moderate intensity, in 
the  daridorexant  groups.  These  AE  are  could  be  expected  regarding  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the  DORA 
(antagonism of the orexin receptors, stimulation of sleep-promoting effects). 
Accidents and injuries (including falls) 
In the individual pivotal studies 301 and 302, there was a consistently lower or similar incidence rate of TEAEs 
pertaining to accidents and injuries including falls in the daridorexant groups compared to the placebo group. 
In the long-term study 303, the rates of TEAEs of falls, accidents and injuries in the different groups, were 
comparable.  More  than half  of  falls  occurred  in  elderly  (aged  ≥  65  years).  There  were  external  contributing 
factors for each case and none was treatment related. There was no evidence of any CNS-depressant effects, 
such  as  somnolence  or  impaired  attention,  reported  for  any  subject  reporting  accidents  (including  the  road 
traffic ones), or injuries with or without falls. No falls occurred during the night. 
Overall, there was no evidence of any drug effect or dose dependence as there was no evidence of any CNS-
depressant effect that may have caused the reported falls, accidents or injuries AEs following treatment with 
daridorexant. None of the falls was considered as AESIs, which could exclude a signal for cataplexy. However, 
a caution in elderly is added in the SmPC, similarly to other hypnotics. 
Drug abuse potential 
An abuse potential for daridorexant was observed as compared to placebo and seems comparable to that of 
suvorexant (150 mg), and zolpidem (30 mg) at supratherapeutic doses (100 mg and 150 mg). The analysis of 
data from phase 3 studies did not permit to confirm the abuse risk of daridorexant for the target population of 
patients  with  insomnia  under  experimental  conditions.  In  conclusion,  the  mechanism  of  action,  the 
pharmacological and safety data are relevant enough to constitute substantial evidence of potential for abuse 
of daridorexant. The Applicant’s proposal to add “drug abuse” safety concern as important potential risk on the 
RMP is supported. The warning in section 4.4 has been also amended. 
Overdose 
A total of 44 subjects reported AE of overdose during the double-blind treatment periods of the Phase 3 studies, 
of whom 35/44 were reported as accidental overdose, referring to taking 1 additional tablet on 1 or more than 
1 occasion. Intentional overdose was reported in 2 subjects on placebo in study 302 and was asymptomatic.  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 125/141 
 
 
 
All AEs of accidental overdose were non-serious, mild and asymptomatic except for 2 cases in the 25 mg group 
(disturbance  in  attention  and  hypersomnia  during  the  placebo  run-out  period,  and  mixed  hallucination  and 
sleep paralysis during the DB treatment period). Nearly half of the overdose AE (19/44) were reported during 
the placebo run-in period (10 events, including an intentional overdose in study 302) and the placebo run-out 
period (9 events) in studies 301 and 302. No clear reason is provided for these cases of overdose in the placebo 
groups, and the lack of efficacy could be supposed. 
Overall, these data did not raise any specific concern across all studies. The potential for abuse has otherwise 
been discussed and  added in the RMP. 
Withdrawal symptoms 
Overall  assessment  of  withdrawal  effects  showed  no  evidence  of  a  withdrawal  syndrome  after  daridorexant 
treatment abrupt discontinuation, regardless of the dose. In 301, 303 and pool safety data, no AEs indicating 
a withdrawal syndrome were observed while significant higher proportion of subjects with at least one symptom 
BWSQ item scored as severe (>20) at the end of treatment withdrawal period in the daridorexant group was 
observed as compared to placebo (respectively,  5.6%  and 2.8%).  The Applicant has provided clarifications. 
According to this analysis, withdrawal syndrome was not added in the RMP as a safety concern and a statement 
that there is no evidence of withdrawal symptoms was included the SmPC.  
Rebound insomnia 
Based on the change from baseline to the run-out period in objective (WASO and LPS) and subjective (sTST) 
sleep  parameters,  no  evidence  of  rebound  insomnia  was  observed.  Moreover,  no  AEs  suggesting  rebound 
insomnia or exacerbated insomnia were reported during the placebo run-out period of both DB studies 301 and 
302. There was also no sign of rebound insomnia following a 12-month treatment with daridorexant, whatever 
the dose. 
SAE 
Overall, during the phase 1 to 3 studies, most SAE that occurred were not  treatment related or erroneously 
treatment related, with various medical histories or comorbidities underlying the occurrence of the SAE. There 
was not specific pattern of any system organ class or PT that could be highlighted from these SAE in any study 
treatment group, even if numerically most of the SAE (mainly related to orthopaedic injuries, cardiovascular 
disorders, infectious situations or cancer events) occurred in the 25 mg and 50 mg daridorexant groups. A few 
SAE led to discontinuation, mainly in relation to comorbidities as not treatment related. None of these SAE led 
to death. 
Vital signs and ECG findings  
Daridorexant did not have any clinically relevant effect on vital signs following its administration in any of the 
Phase 1–3 clinical studies. 
For all ECG findings during double-blind period, no treatment or dose-related pattern was observed. There was 
no indication of any systematic effect when compared to placebo. This lack of concern is corroborated by the 
safety pharmacology TQT study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022

Safety in special populations 
The safety in special populations was mainly focused on a comparison of safety data (overall incidence of TEAE) 
in the elderly (≥ 65 years) compared to the younger adult (<65 years) subgroups, in male compared to female 
subjects. Indeed, elderly subjects may be more sensitive to the AE of insomnia therapies than younger adults 
justifying that the pattern of AE between age groups was carefully scrutinized. 
According to the pooled data set, the overall incidences of TEAEs were higher in daridorexant dose groups than 
in placebo groups in both the < 65 years and  ≥ 65 years subgroups and the pattern of the most frequently 
reported TEAE was consistent between the age subgroups. Although there were a few numerical differences 
regarding the incidence of the AE falls and dizziness between the age subgroups, both in the daridorexant and 
the placebo groups, there was no specific signal of increased incidence of falls or dizziness in the elderly treated 
with  daridorexant  vs  those  treated  with  placebo.  This  is  supported  by  a  lesser  incidence  rate  of  falls  and 
dizziness in 50 mg vs 25 mg daridorexant group for both AE. Regarding the AE somnolence and fatigue, the 
same trend is observed in the elderly vs adults. Overall, for the most frequent AE of somnolence, dizziness, 
and fatigue, the incidence was slightly higher in the elderly at 25 mg compared to subjects < 65 years, this 
difference is however not seen in elderly subjects at 50 mg. In the SmPC, the following sentence is stated: 
«The  adverse  reaction  profile  in  elderly  subjects  was  consistent  with  younger  subjects”.  This  is  acceptable. 
However, the experience in patients above the age of 75 years is very limited and this is  reflected in the SmPC. 
It seems that the Japanese subjects (ethnicity study) might be more sensitive to the effects of daridorexant 
(somnolence  and  other  AE  of  interest  such  as  sleep  paralysis,  sudden  onset  of  sleep,  and  disturbance  in 
attention  were  more  frequently  reported  in  Japanese  subjects)  compared  to  Caucasian  subjects.  After 
clarification, there is no precaution in the SmPC for this specific population. 
In summary, no trend of specific safety concern has been highlighted in special populations, considering the 
age, the sex, the ethnicity, the region and the BMI. It seems that the Japanese subjects might be more sensitive 
to the effects of daridorexant compared to Caucasian subjects. This aspect has been clarified based on further 
data provided by the Applicant. There is a lack of data about the use of daridorexant during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding that does not allow to make a statement. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Sixty-nine  (69)  subjects  prematurely  discontinued  from  studies  301,  302  and  303.  Additional  9  subjects 
discontinued from phase 1 and phase 2 studies. A total of 76 discontinuations in phase 2 and phase 3 studies 
represents a rate of 4.5% of premature discontinuation which is rather low. 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 TEAE leading to premature discontinuation of studies 301 and 302 
was low (from 1.0 to 3.2%). There was no dose relationship and the incidence of these AEs was numerically 
higher in the placebo group than in either daridorexant group. 
In study 303, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an AE was higher than in pivotal 
studies in each daridorexant group or placebo group (3.7% for 25 mg, 6.6% for 50 mg and 4.7% for placebo) 
except in the daridorexant 10 mg group (0.7%). Although a higher rate of discontinuation could be explained 
by the longer treatment exposure, the low rate of discontinuation observed in the 10 mg daridorexant group 
may be due to a lower occurrence of AE in this low-dose group. 
No specific trend could be observed from these AE leading to discontinuation in any group as there was no dose 
relationship and the incidence of AE leading to discontinuation was numerically higher in the placebo groups of 
the pivotal studies than in the daridorexant groups.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
A total of 1655 subjects with insomnia in phase 2 and phase 3 studies including the ongoing phase 3 study 
received at least one dose of daridorexant all doses combined, and 729 subjects received at least one dose of 
placebo. Of these 1655 subjects, 804 subjects received 25 mg, 369 subjects received 50 mg and 364 subjects 
received 10 mg. 
The following clinical safety conclusions and concerns that have been clarified are summarized hereafter: 
• The majority of ADRs were mild to moderate in intensity and there was no evidence of any dose relationship 
for either the frequency or the severity of ADRs. The ADR profile in the elderly was consistent with the profile 
in younger subjects. The applicant was requested to provide a respective justification/calculation as a process 
of estimation of frequency category for each ADR separately (i.e. “common” for all the ADRs). It should follow 
the guidance on how to estimate the frequency of ADR which is available within the EC document “A guideline 
on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)”, September 2009. The Applicant provided a brief explanation 
of  the  frequency  categories  assigned to  the  ADRs  which  are  to  be  outlined  in  the  section  4.8  of  SmPC  and 
respective part of the PIL. The data comes from the clinical trial incidences and leads to the frequency “common” 
in 5 ADRs and “uncommon” in 2 ADRs. 
•  A  small  increase  in  AEs  of  headache,  somnolence,  fatigue,  dizziness,  and  nausea  was  observed  for 
daridorexant compared to placebo, with no apparent dose dependence. 
• No suicidal ideation or worsening of depression is highlighted. However as regards to the potential suicidal 
behaviour in high-risk patients (with a medical history of depression or other psychiatric disorders), this risk 
has been added as a safety concern in the RMP among the important potential risks. 
• No cases of cataplexy and no cases of complex sleep behaviours (such as sleep walking / somnambulism, 
sleep driving, sleep talking, sleep eating, or sleep sex) were reported with daridorexant treatment. However, 
there were isolated cases of sleep paralysis and/or sleep-related hallucinations with daridorexant treatment, 
without dose dependency. However, although not frequent and not categorized as serious during the phase 2 
and 3 studies, a few cases of sleep paralysis were encoded as severe and led to study discontinuation. This 
safety concern was not added in the RMP. Follow up this safety concern via routine pharmacovigilance (i.e., 
signal detection and adverse reaction reporting) as proposed by the Applicant is deemed sufficient. 
•  No  next-morning  residual  effect  was  observed  and  there  was  no  clinically  significant  trend  of  daytime 
sleepiness or increased somnolence. There was also no rebound insomnia when daridorexant is discontinued. 
No AEs indicating a withdrawal syndrome were observed while significant higher proportion of subjects with at 
least one risk symptom BWSQ item scored as severe (>20) at the end of treatment withdrawal period in the 
daridorexant group was observed as compared to placebo and clarified by the Applicant. There was no evidence 
of withdrawal symptoms upon drug discontinuation in clinical trials with daridorexant in subjects with insomnia. 
• There was no increase in the risk of fall, accident or injury, in particular in elderly, considering that subjects 
> 65 years are of particular concern for these events. A caution in the SmPC has been added. 
• A relative risk of abuse potential was suggested, based on the ‘drug-liking’ assessment in the HAP study (with 
no nonclinical signal). As regards to the potential for drug abuse, this risk has been added as a safety concern 
in the RMP among the important potential risks.

• Impairment of driving was shown at treatment initiation in healthy subjects, with disappearance of the effect 
after repeated doses. Clarifications regarding the methodology used in the study before have been provided. 
In addition, the SmPC statement has been adequately amended. 
•  No  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  moderate  COPD  subjects  and  in  mild  and  moderate  OSA  subjects. 
Special statement are added in the SmPC for severe COPD and OSA related to the lack of data in these subjects. 
• No dose reduction in patients with mild to severe renal impairment was recommended. There is insufficient 
knowledge about the use of daridorexant in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and a statement in the 
SmPC to not recommended daridorexant for this specific population has been added.  
•  No  difference  in  the  safety  profile  of  daridorexant  was  identified  in  subgroups  according  to  age,  sex, 
race/ethnicity, region, or BMI that would influence the therapeutic dose. A precaution in Japanese subjects was 
not necessary. However studies are ongoing and the PI could be further updated if relevant 
•  No  safety  issues  were  identified  during the  preliminary  results  of  the  long-term  study  303.  The  Applicant 
further provided data from this extension study and the number of subjects is around 100 subjects at 1 year 
for the recommended 50 mg daridorexant dose.

2.7.3.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 07 January 2022. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
{EBD} {IBD} to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, QUVIVIQ (daridorexant) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it includes new active substance.   
Assessment report

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5, 2013), insomnia 
disorder is defined as “a predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with one (or 
more) of the following symptoms:  
(i) 
difficulty initiating sleep,  
(ii) 
difficulty maintaining sleep characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep 
after awakenings, 
(iii) 
early‑morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.  
The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment with detrimental effects on daytime 
functioning, including social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of 
functioning”.  
Similar diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were defined in the International Classification of Sleep 
Disorders. 3rd Edition (ICSD-3, 2014). 
Insomnia is associated with an abnormal state of hyperarousal that overrides the normal control of sleep. 
Orexin is a central promotor of arousal and vigilance.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to treatment guidelines from the US and Europe, the first-line treatment is Insomnia-specific 
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-i). Pharmacological intervention can be offered when CBT-i is not 
effective or not available. 
Use of hypnotic drugs is currently mostly recommended for short-term treatment, or as a temporary adjunct 
to CBT-i, due to safety limitations.  
Pharmacological treatment consists of benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor agonists, 
melatonin receptor agonists, and drugs that are administered in off-label use (e.g., sedating antidepressants, 
antihistamines). 
In addition, several over-the-counter herbal medicines are used by people with insomnia.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence of the efficacy of Quviviq (daridorexant) in the intended indication is based mainly on data from 
2 pivotal phase 3 studies versus placebo (study 301 and study 302), supported by the interim results from 
one ongoing DB Phase 3 extension study (study 303). 
Supportive data was obtained from two Phase 2 dose-finding studies one in adult subjects versus placebo 
with an active arm (zolpidem) (study 201) and one cross-over versus placebo in elderly (study 202).   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal studies, the difference from placebo of the 50 mg dose on objective co-primary endpoints 
(WASO, LPS) is statistically significant at month 1 and month 3 (-18.3 [-23.9; -12.7] min, p-value <0.0001 
for WASO; –11.7 [–16.3, –7.0] min, p-value <0.0001 for LPS). The difference from placebo of the 50 mg 
dose is also statistically significant on subjective secondary sTST endpoint at month 1 and month 3 (22.1 
[14.4, 29.7] min, p-value <0.0001 at month 1). The effect observed at month 1 is similar to efficacy at 
month 3.   
The efficacy of the 50 mg dose studied in one pivotal study on sleep awakenings, sleep latency and total 
sleep time seems clinically relevant. Indeed, after 3 months of daridorexant treatment at the 50 mg dose, 
patients sleep more than 6 hours on average per night, with a sleep latency of around 30 minutes and have 
around 1 hour of awakenings during the night.  
Statistically significant difference over placebo was achieved for the 2 primary endpoints (WASO, LPS) at 25 
mg in study 301 but failed for one of the primary endpoint (LPS) at 25 mg in study 302. The efficacy of 10 
mg dose is not demonstrated.  
Results by subgroups were consistent with the overall results. There was no apparent difference depending 
on the sex, age or region. In all demographic subgroups, the 50 mg dose provided a larger benefit than the 
25 mg dose across almost all endpoints. 
The long term study was a 40 weeks double-blind and placebo-controlled with efficacy exploratory subjective 
endpoints. Although an important placebo effect on subjective endpoints (sTST, sLSO, sWASO) was observed 
for patients treated with placebo, the effect seems maintained at 1 year for daridorexant 50 mg. 
No next-morning residual effect was observed and there was no clinically significant trend of daytime sleepiness 
or increased somnolence. On the contrary, it was shown that the morning sleepiness, which could also be a 
consequence of insomnia, improved on daridorexant treatment, according to the results of the daily morning 
sleepiness VAS.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
EMA guideline recommends including an active comparator in phase 3 studies and this recommendation were 
not followed by the Applicant since the phase 3 studies did not include an active comparator. However, the 
addition of zolpidem as an active comparator in one of the pivotal studies during the first 4 weeks would have 
complicated results interpretation and make them unsuitable for inclusion in the primary analysis. Also, one 
phase 2 study (201) includes zolpidem as active comparator for validation assay. 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 133/141 
 
 
 
 
EMA guideline recommends using subjective primary endpoints. Results should be supported by objective 
data. Those recommendation were not followed by the Applicant since the phase 3 studies used objective 
criteria (WASO, LPS) for primary endpoints and subjective criteria as secondary endpoints as this allowed 
them to comply with FDA requirements.  
The objective assessment of awakenings during the night is not supported by subjective assessment. 
However, the total sleep time assessed subjectively follows the same trend that sleep duration assessed 
objectively with an acceptable observed dose effect at 50 mg. The choice of sTST as a key secondary 
endpoint with a well-controlled type 1 error is accepted by the CHMP to support the reassurance on efficacy. 
The EMA guideline also recommends to include next-day daytime functioning as a co-primary endpoint in 
both studies. This was not followed by the Applicant. The Applicant justification related to the unavailable 
IDSIQ score at the time of phase 3 program discussion is partially endorsed. The impact on daytime 
functioning could also have been assessed by the ISI score which takes into account the impact on daytime 
functioning.      
Based on pivotal studies results, 50 mg dose can be validated as efficient dose. However, this dose was only 
assessed in one pivotal study (301). It would have been appreciated to confirm the data observed at the 50 
mg dose by another pivotal study performed with the same dose. The Applicant specifies that design of the 2 
pivotal studies with only one study with the 50 mg dose was considered the most efficient design based on 
the knowledge at the time of the phase 3 program. 
For the subjective secondary endpoint IDSIQ sleepiness domain score, the subjective effect on daytime 
sleepiness is statistically significant at 50 mg at month 1 and month 3. The mean difference to placebo at 50 
mg is -1.8 [-2.5;-1] and -1.9 [-2.9;-0.9] at month 1 and month 3. The difference of 2 points on average on a 
graduated scale from 0 to 40 looks weak. The responder analysis on IDSIQ sleepiness domain with a 4 points 
or 8 points change were provided. Taking into account the 0-40 scale, the 8 points change could be 
considered as particularly clinically relevant. In study 301, at the 50 mg dose at 3 month, 37% of treated 
patients reported at least 8 points decrease at 3 months compared to 24.0% of responders in the placebo 
group. In the same study, the percentage of subjects showing a decrease from baseline at Month 3 of at least 
4 points was 52.9% in the daridorexant 50 mg group, 50.0% in the 25 mg group and 44.4% in the placebo 
group. These results are not impressive. However, the impact on daytime functioning assessed by IDSIQ 
scores is supported by results observed on VAS daytime alertness and on VAS on ability to function. Same 
trend of improvement is observed through these tools leading to a positive impact of daridorexant at 50 mg 
per day on daytime functioning. 
The patient complaints which are assessed by subjective measures (sTST, sWASO, sLSO) are important 
points to consider in insomnia. The values of subjective measures are lower with daridorexant than the 
objective values.  The Applicant proposes a Pearson correlation analysis between objective (TST, WASO, LPS) 
and subjective endpoints (sTST, sWASO LSO). According to this analysis, there is a poor correlation between 
objective and subjective endpoints. The objective and subjective endpoints are different in nature and 
collection methods, this may partly explain the weak correlation of the parameters. 
Subjects with insomnia associated with acute or unstable psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety or 
dementia) were excluded from pivotal studies according to exclusion criteria. 6% to 8% patients with stable 
psychiatric comorbidities depending on the pivotal study were included. There are very few efficacy data on 
patients with psychiatric co-morbidities, whereas psychiatric comorbidities are often associated with 
insomnia. A warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 134/141 
 
 
 
Overall there are around 100 patients older than 75 years included in the phase III studies at different doses 
(54/930 in study 301 and 56/925 in study 302) however data on patients older than 75 years at 50 mg (19 
patients in pivotal studies and 11 patients in phase 2 study) are limited. There are almost no patient older 
than 85 years (3/930 in study 301 and 1/925 in study 302). Based on data analysis over the full age range, 
the higher efficacy of the 50 mg dose on primary and secondary endpoints in patients aged from 65 to 75 
years is considered as demonstrated and seems maintained in patients older than 75 years. Although there is 
no risk signal in elderly population at this time, caution should be used in this population.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• A small increase in AEs of headache, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea was observed for 
daridorexant compared to placebo, with no apparent dose dependence. Regarding the daytime somnolence 
and CNS-depressant effects, it was shown that fatigue and somnolence are the most frequent CNS-
depressant AE, of mild or moderate intensity, in the daridorexant groups. These AE could be expected 
regarding the mechanism of action of the DORA (antagonism of the orexin receptors, stimulation of sleep-
promoting effects). 
• The concomitant administration of daridorexant and alcohol led to additive PD effect without any evidence 
of a synergic effect. As somnolence is the main reported AE in case of concomitant administration, alcohol 
consumption is therefore not recommended during treatment with daridorexant. 
• Regarding the SAE, during the phase 1 to 3 studies, most were not treatment related or erroneously 
treatment related, with various medical histories or comorbidities underlying the occurrence of the SAE. 
There was not specific pattern of any system organ class or PT that could be highlighted from these SAE in 
any study treatment group, even if numerically most of the SAE (mainly related to orthopaedic injuries, 
cardiovascular disorders, infectious situations or cancer events) occurred in the 25 mg and 50 mg 
daridorexant groups. A few SAE led to discontinuation, mainly in relation to comorbidities since not treatment 
related. None of these SAE led to death. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No cases of cataplexy and no cases of complex sleep behaviours (such as sleep walking / somnambulism, sleep 
driving, sleep talking, sleep eating, or sleep sex) were reported with daridorexant treatment. However, there 
were isolated cases of sleep paralysis and/or sleep-related hallucinations with daridorexant treatment, without 
dose dependency. Although not frequent and not categorized as serious during the phase 2 and 3 studies, a 
few cases of sleep paralysis were encoded as severe and led to study discontinuation.  Considering the AESI 
sleep paralysis, some clarifications were provided in the SmPC, in  particular that these events mainly occur 
during  the  first  few  weeks  after  treatment  initiation.  Following  up  on  this  safety  concern  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance  (i.e.,  signal  detection  and  adverse  reaction  reporting)  as  proposed  by  the  Applicant  is 
deemed sufficient by the  CHMP. 
The AEs of suicidal ideation in Phase 3 studies were reported in 4 isolated cases, 2 in study 302 and 2 in study 
303, equally distributed across daridorexant treatment and placebo groups (1 subject in each treatment group 
: 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg and placebo). Based on the C-SSRS scores assessment of the individual cases, and the 
pre-existing psychiatric disorders, and/or acute difficult circumstances (family stress, financial stress, illicit drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/187589/2022 
Page 135/141 
 
 
 
 
 
use),  there  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  risk  of  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  during  treatment  with 
daridorexant, as well as no dose-dependent trend. However, considering the potential seriousness of this AESI, 
this potential risk is added in the RMP which is supported by the CHMP.   
A medical history within the psychiatric disorders SOC was reported in a total of 54 subjects (approximately 
6%)  in  study  301  and  63  subjects  (approximately  7%)  in  study  302.  No  AEs  pertaining  to  depression  or 
worsening of depression occurred in these subjects. The number of AEs denoting depression was rather low 
and balanced between treatment groups and study periods. There was no evidence of depression or worsening 
of depression during treatment with daridorexant, in particular in subjects with a medical history of psychiatric 
disorders, including depression. However, considering the potential seriousness of this AESI, this potential risk 
is added in the RMP under the safety concern “Suicidal behaviour in high-risk patients (with a medical history 
of depression or other psychiatric disorders)”which is supported by the CHMP. 
An abuse potential for daridorexant was observed as compared to placebo and seems comparable to that of 
suvorexant (150 mg), and zolpidem (30 mg) at supratherapeutic doses (100 mg and 150 mg). The analysis of 
data from phase 3 studies did not permit to confirm the abuse risk of daridorexant for the target population of 
patients  with  insomnia  under  experimental  conditions.  The  Applicant’s  proposal  to  add  “drug  abuse”  safety 
concern as important potential risk on the RMP is supported as well as the warning in section 4.4  of the SmPC. 
No dose reduction in patients with mild to severe renal impairment was recommended.  There is insufficient 
knowledge about the use of daridorexant in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and a statement in the 
SmPC to not recommended daridorexant for this specific population has been added.  
No safety data are available with daridorexant in pregnant women and in breastfeeding women. These safety 
concerns are added among the missing information in the RMP. Statements in the SmPC have been amended. 
The experience in patients above the age of 75 years is very limited and this has been reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy package presented in this application establishes the  efficacy of daridorexant in the treatment of 
adult patients with insomnia of moderate to severe intensity and insufficient sleep quantity during at least 3 
months.  
Insomnia is associated with an abnormal state of hyperarousal that overrides the normal control of sleep. 
Daridorexant is a specific and potent dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA). Orexin neuropeptides (orexin A 
and orexin B) are central promotor of arousal and vigilance. It could therefore be hypothesized that 
daridorexant acts on sleep maintenance and on sleep latency in contrast with hypnotics such as 
benzodiazepines and z-drugs which act mainly on sleep latency. 
The insomnia first-line treatment is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). However, pharmacological 
intervention can be added when CBT is not effective or not available. At this time, use of hypnotic drugs is 
currently mostly recommended for short-term treatment due to safety limitations of benzodiazepines and z-
drugs. There is an unmet medical need for patients with chronic insomnia.  
The statistically significant difference over placebo is achieved for the 2 primary objective endpoints (WASO, 
LPS) at 50 mg in study 301. Efficacy data obtained from pivotal study 301 conducted in patients with 
moderate to severe insomnia demonstrated significant clinical superiority over placebo. 
Clarifications were provided for efficacy data especially regarding the absence of active comparator, the use 
of objective endpoints as primary endpoints and daridorexant efficacy assessed by subjective endpoints 
which seems less important than when assessed by objective endpoints. The clinical relevance of sleep 
improvement is acceptable and the impact on daytime functioning seems positive although difficult to assess 
based on the selected IDSIQ score.  
The safety profile of daridorexant is consistent with its mechanism of action (a specific and potent dual orexin 
receptor antagonist, acting on both orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors and equipotent on both) and other DORA, 
suvorexant and lemborexant are already  marketed in the USA.  
The common adverse reactions of mild to moderate intensity are somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, headache and 
nausea  which  were  observed  more  frequently  in  the  daridorexant  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups.  The 
adverse reaction profile in elderly subjects was consistent with younger subjects. There was no evidence of a 
dose-relationship for the frequency or severity of adverse reactions at the recommended therapeutic dose. 
A relative risk of abuse potential was suggested, based on the ‘drug-liking’ assessment in the HAP study (but 
with no nonclinical signal). The “drug abuse” safety concern has been added as an important potential risk on 
the RMP.  
No safety issues were identified during the preliminary results of the long-term study 303. The Applicant further 
provided data from this extension study and the number of subjects is around 100 subjects at 1 year for the 
recommended 50 mg daridorexant dose. The provided long-term safety data are consistent with those observed 
during the first 3 months of treatment, and do not more represent a concern with regards to long-term potential 
risks, even in the absence of a recommended treatment duration.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The use of daridorexant in treatment of patients with insomnia which is based on antagonist (DORA) of both 
orexin 1 (OX1) and orexin 2 (OX2) receptors is supported by favourable effects observed with the 50 mg 
dose.  
The statistically significant difference over placebo was achieved for the 2 primary objective endpoints (WASO, 
LPS) at 50 mg in study 301. Efficacy data obtained from pivotal study 301 conducted in patients with moderate 
to  severe  insomnia  and  insufficient  sleep  quantity  for  at  least  3  nights  per  week  during  at  least  3  months 
demonstrated  significant  clinical  superiority  over  placebo.  From  the  efficacy  perspective,  the  clinical 
development adequately supports the proposed indication at 50 mg. Available data could support the use of 
the 25 mg dose, when in judgement of the clinician a lower dose than 50 mg could be appropriate, for example 
in patients already treated with CNS depressant. 
The agreed indication “the treatment of adult patients with insomnia characterised by symptoms present for at 
least 3 months and considerable impact on daytime functioning” reflects the characteristic of chronic insomnia. 
The treatment should be as short as possible and the need to reassess the appropriateness of continued 
treatment within 3 months should be specified in the SmPC. 
Overall, favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects.

Elderly
Population pharmacokinetic modelling suggests no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences 
between elderly and younger subjects. No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 15-29 mL/min), and 
in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 15 mL/min), the recommended dose is 10 mg 
once daily. For patients with ESRD undergoing intermittent dialysis, AQUIPTA should preferably be 
taken after dialysis.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). Atogepant should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of atogepant in children (< 18 years of age) have not yet been established. No 
data are available.
Method of administration
AQUIPTA is for oral use. Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or 
chewed.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Atogepant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Excipients with known effect
AQUIPTA 10 mg tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
AQUIPTA 60 mg tablets contain 31.5 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1.6% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
CYP3A4 inhibitors
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) can 
significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant. Co-administration of atogepant with 
itraconazole resulted in increased exposure (Cmax by 2.15-fold and AUC by 5.5-fold) of atogepant in 
healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Changes in atogepant exposure when co-administered with weak or 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.
Transporter inhibitors
Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors (e.g., rifampicin, ciclosporin, ritonavir) can 
significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant. Co-administration of atogepant with single dose 
rifampicin resulted in increased exposure (Cmax by 2.23-fold and AUC by 2.85-fold) of atogepant in 
healthy subjects (see section 4.2).
Frequently co-administered medicinal products
Co-administration of atogepant with oral contraceptive components ethinyl estradiol and 
levonorgestrel, paracetamol, naproxen, sumatriptan, or ubrogepant did not result in significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions for either atogepant or co-administered medicinal products. Co-
administration with famotidine or esomeprazole did not result in clinically relevant changes of 
atogepant exposure.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are limited data from the use of atogepant in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Atogepant is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether atogepant is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals 
have shown excretion of atogepant in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from atogepant therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of atogepant on fertility are available. Animal studies showed no impact 
on female and male fertility with atogepant treatment (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Atogepant has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, it may 
cause somnolence in some patients. Patients should exercise caution before driving or using machinery 
until they are reasonably certain that atogepant does not adversely affect performance.

4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Safety was evaluated in 2 657 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of atogepant in 
clinical studies. Of these, 1 225 patients were exposed to atogepant for at least 6 months and 
826 patients were exposed for 12 months.
In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 678 patients received at least one dose of atogepant 
60 mg once daily, and 663 patients received placebo.
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions were nausea (9%), constipation (8%), and 
fatigue/somnolence (5%). Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The adverse 
reaction that most commonly led to discontinuation was nausea (0.4%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and from post-marketing experience are listed below by 
system organ class and frequency, most frequent reactions first. Frequencies are defined as follows: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of 
decreasing seriousness.

* Defined in clinical trials as weight decrease of at least 7% at any point.
** Cases of ALT/AST elevations (defined as ≥ 3× upper limit of normal) temporally associated with atogepant 
were observed in clinical trials, including cases with a potential positive dechallenge history that resolved within 
8 weeks of discontinuation. However, the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations was similar in the 
atogepant and placebo groups.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
In clinical studies, atogepant was administered as single doses up to 300 mg and as multiple doses up 
to 170 mg once daily. Adverse reactions were comparable to those seen at lower doses, and no specific 
toxicities were identified. There is no known antidote for atogepant. Treatment of an overdose should 
consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC 
code: N02CD07
Mechanism of action
Non-clinical receptor binding studies and in vitro functional studies point to an involvement of more 
than one receptor type in the pharmacological effects of atogepant. Atogepant shows affinity to several 
receptors  of  the  calcitonin/CGRP-receptor  family.  In  view  of  the  clinically  relevant  free  plasma 
concentrations  of  atogepant  (Cmax > 20 nM  for  a  60 mg  dose)  and  the  fact  that  CGRP  and  amylin-1 
receptors  are  considered  to  be  involved  in  the  pathophysiology  of  migraine,  inhibitory  effects  of 
atogepant at these receptors (Ki-value 26 pM and 2.4 nM, respectively) could be of clinical relevance. 
However, the precise mechanism of action of atogepant in the prophylaxis of migraine remains to be 
established.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Atogepant was evaluated for the prophylaxis of migraine in two pivotal studies across the migraine 
spectrum in chronic and episodic migraine. The episodic migraine study (ADVANCE) enrolled 
patients who met International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis of 
migraine with or without aura. The chronic migraine study (PROGRESS) enrolled patients who also 
met ICHD criteria for chronic migraine. Both studies excluded patients with myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or transient ischemic attacks within six months prior to screening.
Episodic migraine
Atogepant was evaluated for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine (4 to 14 migraine days per month) 
in a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ADVANCE). Patients were 
randomised to AQUIPTA 60 mg (N = 235) or placebo (N = 223) once daily for 12 weeks. Patients 
were allowed to use acute headache treatments (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives, NSAIDs, 
paracetamol and opioids) as needed. The use of a concomitant medicinal product that acts on the 
CGRP pathway was not permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine.
A total of 88% patients completed the 12-week double-blind study period. Patients had a mean age of 
42 years (range: 18 to 73 years), 4% were 65 years or older, 89% were female, and 83% were white. 
The mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 8 migraine days per month and was 
similar across treatment groups.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMD) 
across the 12-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints controlled for multiplicity included the 
change from baseline in mean monthly headache days, the change from baseline in mean monthly 
acute medication use days, the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction from baseline 
in mean MMD (3 month average), and several patient-reported outcome measures assessing 
functioning. Statistically significant findings were demonstrated for AQUIPTA versus placebo for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in ADVANCE, as summarized in Table 3.

Long-term efficacy
Efficacy was sustained for up to one year in an open-label study in which 546 patients with episodic 
migraine were randomised to receive AQUIPTA 60 mg once daily. 68% (373/546) of patients 
completed the treatment period. The reduction in the least-squares mean number of monthly migraine 
days in the first month (weeks 1-4) was -3.8 days and improved to a least-squares mean reduction of -
5.2 days in the last month (weeks 49-52). Approximately 84%, 70%, and 48% of patients reported 
≥ 50%, ≥ 75%, and 100% reduction in monthly migraine days at weeks 49-52, respectively.

Chronic migraine
Atogepant was evaluated for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine (15 or more headache days per 
month with at least 8 migraine days) in a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study (PROGRESS). Patients were randomised to AQUIPTA 60 mg (N = 262) or placebo (N = 259) 
once daily for 12 weeks. A subset of patients (11%) was allowed to use one concomitant migraine 
prophylaxis medicinal product (e.g., amitriptyline, propranolol, topiramate). Patients were allowed to 
use acute headache treatments (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives, NSAIDs, paracetamol and 
opioids) as needed. Patients with acute medication overuse and medication overuse headache also 
were enrolled. The use of a concomitant medicinal product that acts on the CGRP pathway was not 
permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine.
A total of 463 (89%) patients completed the 12-week double-blind study. Patients had a mean age of 
42 years (range: 18 to 74 years), 3% were 65 years or older, 87% were female, and 59% were white. 
The mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 19 migraine days per month and was 
similar across treatment groups.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMD across the 12-week
treatment period. Secondary endpoints controlled for multiplicity included the change from baseline in 
mean monthly headache days, the change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days, 
the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction from baseline in mean MMD (3-month 
average), and several patient-reported outcome measures assessing functioning. Statistically 
significant findings were demonstrated for AQUIPTA versus placebo for the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints for PROGRESS, as summarized in Table 4.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
AQUIPTA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prophylaxis of migraine headaches 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following oral administration, atogepant is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations at 
approximately 1 to 2 hours.  Following once daily dosing, atogepant displays dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetics up to 170 mg (approximately 3 times the highest recommended dose), with no 
accumulation.
Effect of food
When atogepant was administered with a high-fat meal, AUC and Cmax were reduced by 
approximately 18% and 22%, respectively, with no effect on median time to maximum atogepant 
plasma concentration. Atogepant was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies.
Distribution
Plasma protein binding of atogepant was not concentration-dependent in the range of 0.1 to 10 µM; 
the unbound fraction of atogepant was approximately 4.7% in human plasma. The mean apparent 
volume of distribution of atogepant (Vz/F) after oral administration is approximately 292 L.
Biotransformation
Atogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. The parent compound 
(atogepant), and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite (M23) were the most prevalent circulating 
components in human plasma.
9
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4 inducers
Co-administration of atogepant with steady state rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in a 
significant decrease in exposure  (Cmax by 30% and AUC by 60%) of atogepant in healthy subjects.
Co-administration of atogepant with steady-state topiramate, a mild CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in a 
decrease in exposure (Cmax by 24% and AUC by 25%) of atogepant.
In vitro, atogepant is not an inhibitor for CYP3A4, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, MAO-A, or 
UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant also is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations.
Elimination
The elimination half-life of atogepant is approximately 11 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance 
(CL/F) of atogepant is approximately 19 L/h. Following single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-atogepant to 
healthy male subjects, 42% and 5% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atogepant in faeces and 
urine, respectively.
Transporters
Atogepant is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OAT1. Dose adjustment for 
concomitant use with strong inhibitors of OATP is recommended based on a clinical interaction study 
with a strong OATP inhibitor. Atogepant is not a substrate of OAT3, OCT2, or MATE1.
Atogepant is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, NTCP, BSEP, MRP3, or MRP4 at 
clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and 
MATE1, but no clinically relevant interactions are expected.
Special populations
Renal impairment
The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of atogepant in 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-89 mL/min) relative to those with normal 
renal function (CLcr  90 mL/min). As patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD; CLcr < 30 mL/min) have not been studied, use of atogepant 10 mg is recommended in 
those patients.
Hepatic impairment
In patients with pre-existing mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), total atogepant exposure was increased by 24%, 15% and 
38%, respectively. However, unbound atogepant exposure was approximately 3-fold higher in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment. The use of AQUIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment
should be avoided.
Other special populations
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, sex, race, and body weight did not have a significant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics (Cmax and AUC) of atogepant. Therefore, no dose adjustments are 
warranted based on these factors.
10
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Notwithstanding marked interspecies differences in CGRP-receptor affinity of atogepant, non-clinical 
data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  atogepant  in  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, phototoxicity or carcinogenic potential.
Impairment of fertility
Oral administration of atogepant  to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in 
females to gestation day 7 resulted in no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance. 
Plasma exposures (AUC) are up to approximately 15 times that in humans at the maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD).
Reproductive and developmental toxicology
Oral administration of atogepant to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis 
resulted in decreased foetal body weight in rats and an increased incidence of foetal visceral and 
skeletal variations at doses associated with minimal maternal toxicity. At the no-effect dose for 
adverse effects on embryofoetal development, plasma exposure (AUC) was approximately 4 times in 
rats and 3 times in rabbits that in humans at the MRHD of 60 mg/day.
Oral administration of atogepant to rats throughout gestation and lactation resulted in non-adverse 
significant decreased pup body weight which persisted into adulthood. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the 
no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal development were approximately 5-times that in humans at the 
MRHD. In lactating rats, oral dosing with atogepant resulted in levels of atogepant in milk 
approximately 2-fold higher than those in maternal plasma.

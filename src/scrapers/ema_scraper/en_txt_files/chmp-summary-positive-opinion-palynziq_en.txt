Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Palynziq 
pegvaliase 
On 28 February 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Palynziq, 
intended for the treatment of phenylketonuria. Palynziq was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 
28 January 2010. The applicant for this medicinal product is BioMarin International Limited. 
Palynziq will be available as 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg solutions for injection. The active substance of 
Palynziq is pegvaliase, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme that converts 
phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid, which are then eliminated from the body primarily by 
liver metabolism. 
The benefits with Palynziq are its ability to reduce levels of phenylalanine in the blood. The most common 
side effects are injection site reactions, arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions. 
The full indication is: “treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 16 years and older who have 
inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 micromol/l) despite 
prior management with available treatment options”. It is proposed that Palynziq be prescribed by 
physicians experienced in the the management of PKU. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

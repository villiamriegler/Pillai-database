1.  Introduction 
On 19 October 2022, the MAH submitted a clinical study report for a non-interventional clinical study 
(study number CAIN457A1402) for Cosentyx. In principle, the completed study was not a paediatric 
study, but since a single adolescent patient (aged 16 years) had been enrolled into the study, the 
clinical study report was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. It briefly summarises the study results in the 
overall population as well as for the single adolescent patient. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CAIN457A1402, titled “Special drug-use investigation for Cosentyx 
subcutaneous injection”, is part of the development program to support the registration of Cosentyx in 
pustular psoriasis in Japan and completed on 19 April 2022. As part of the post-marketing surveillance 
request from the Japanese Health Authority to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Cosentyx 
subcutaneous injection in pustular psoriasis patients in Japan, the study enrolled 99 patients, including 
1 paediatric patient aged < 18 years. 
The results of the study were submitted to the CHMP as a stand-alone submission. According to the 
MAH, the submitted data from the single paediatric patient do not warrant any update of the currently 
approved product labelling. Notably, within the EU, Cosentyx is currently not authorised for pustular 
psoriasis. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study was a post-marketing surveillance study. The following presentations are listed in the study 
report as having been used: 
(1) Cosentyx 150 mg Syringe for Subcutaneous Injection 
(2) Cosentyx 150 mg for Subcutaneous Injection 
(3) Cosentyx 150 mg Pen for Subcutaneous Injection

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CAIN457A1402, titled “Special drug-use investigation for Cosentyx 
subcutaneous injection” 
Description 
The study was a post-marketing surveillance conducted as requested by the Japanese regulatory 
authorities at approval to collect safety and efficacy data of Cosentyx subcutaneous injection (hereafter 
called Cosentyx) in clinical use in the newly approved indication. 
Methods 
The study was an open-label, multicentre, uncontrolled, single-arm, prospective observational 
surveillance in Japanese patients with pustular psoriasis receiving Cosentyx for the first time since the 
approval of a supplemental application for this new indication. The study was to be conducted at 
around 30 Japanese dermatology departments and other sites that have dermatologists familiar with 
the diagnosis and treatment of pustular psoriasis and that had adopted Cosentyx or to which Cosentyx 
had been delivered. 
The observation period was 52 weeks from the start of treatment with Cosentyx. The follow-up period 
was 2 years from the end of the observation period (156 weeks from the start of treatment with 
Cosentyx). 
Study participants 
Patients with pustular psoriasis who are not adequately responding to conventional therapies, and who 
were receiving Cosentyx for the first time since the approval of a supplemental application for this new 
indication were registered in this surveillance. Patients had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria: 
Inclusion criteria 
1.  Patients who provide written consent to cooperate with this surveillance before registration 
2.  Patients who meet either of the following 
a.  Patients not adequately responding to ultraviolet light therapy and other conventional 
systemic therapies (other than biological drugs) and whose eruption covers 10% of the 
body surface area or more 
b.  Patients with refractory eruption, joint symptoms, or pustules 
Exclusion criteria 
1.  Patients previously treated with secukinumab or a product containing the same active ingredient 
as Cosentyx (either as an investigational drug or in a post-marketing clinical study) 
2.  Patients who will be treated with a product containing the same active ingredient as Cosentyx (in 
a post-marketing clinical study) 
Treatments 
Being a non-interventional surveillance, there was no binding treatment strategy, and patients were 
treated in accordance with approved labelling. For Japan, the usual Cosentyx psoriasis dose for adults

is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by administration of 300 mg 
every 4 weeks. According to body weight, 150 mg can be administered. 
Objective 
The stated objective of the surveillance was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Cosentyx 
subcutaneous injection in clinical use in Japanese pustular psoriasis patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
• 
Incidence of adverse events during the 52-week observation period in patients treated with 
Cosentyx 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Number of patients with incidences of serious infections and malignant tumours occurring 
during the total 156 weeks of the observation period 
PASI 50/75/90/100 response rates at Week 16 and Week 52 
Percent change in PASI from baseline to different time points until Week 52 
• 
• 
•  DLQI score improvement to 0 or 1 at Week 16 and Week 52 
•  Changes in DLQI total score from baseline to Week 16 and Week 52 
• 
Pustular psoriasis severity scores at each timepoint and changes from baseline, based on the 
generalized pustular psoriasis severity criteria of the JDA 
•  Number and proportion of patients in each of the 3 pustular psoriasis severity categories (mild, 
moderate, or severe) at each assessment time point 
•  Number and proportion of patients with global impression of change grades (complete 
response, partial response, no response, progression, and not evaluable) at each assessment 
time point 
There were no binding treatment steps or visit schedule. Routine medical practice was followed for the 
visit frequency and tests to be performed, and only these data were collected as part of the 
surveillance. 
Events considered as identified risks or potential risks in the Cosentyx risk management plan were 
separately defined as priority investigation items for purposes of the surveillance. The priority 
investigation items included: serious infections, tuberculosis, neutropenia, fungal infections, 
hypersensitivity reactions, malignant tumours, inflammatory bowel disease, and 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. 
Sample size 
The target sample size of the safety analysis set in this surveillance was set at 100 patients and the 
target number of patients to be registered was set at 110 patients, expecting that some patients would 
be excluded from the safety analysis set. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable.

Statistical Methods 
Presentation of data is based on descriptive statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment and numbers analysed 
The first patient was registered and FPFV occurred on 25 February 2016. The end date of registration 
period (LPFV) was on 5 December 2018, and the end date of the surveillance period (LPLV) was on 
24 November 2021. 
During the recruitment period for this surveillance (up to 30 November 2018), 99 patients were 
enrolled at 71 sites, and the surveillance form data were locked for 96 patients on 19 April 2022 
(database lock) at 69 sites. Of these patients, 95 were included in the safety analysis set after 
excluding 1 ineligible patient. A total of 82 patients were included in the efficacy analysis set after 
excluding 13 patients in the safety analysis set who were not evaluable for efficacy. 
Baseline data 
In the safety analysis set, 42 patients (44.2%) were male, and 53 patients (55.8%) were female. 
Mean (SD) age at the start of treatment with Cosentyx was 56.9 (16.0) years. Most patients 
(61 patients, 64.2%) were aged ≥ 15 years and < 65 years, and 34 patients (35.8%) were aged 
≥ 65 years. One of these patients, a single female patient aged 16 years at enrolment, was considered 
a paediatric patient per EU definition. Mean (SD) body weight was 61.3 (13.9) kg and mean (SD) BMI 
was 24.0 (4.8) kg/m2. 
The most common total psoriasis duration was ≥ 10 years to < 20 years (22 patients, 23.2%), followed 
by ≥ 30 years (19 patients, 20.0%) and ≥ 20 years to < 30 years (15 patients, 15.8%). The most 
common pustular psoriasis duration was < 1 year (30 patients, 31.6%) followed by ≥ 1 year to 
< 5 years (15 patients, 15.8%), and ≥ 10 years to < 20 years and ≥ 20 years to < 30 years in 
13 patients (13.7%) each. At baseline, 44 patients (46.3%) had PASI ≤ 20 and 17 patients (17.9%) 
had PASI > 20. Most patients had been previously treated with non-biological products (85 patients, 
89.5%), with the most common being corticosteroids for topical use (50 patients, 52.6%). Biological 
products were used for the treatment of psoriasis or other reasons in 38 patients (40.0%) and for the 
treatment of psoriasis in 37 patients (38.9%). 
Paediatric patient 
As stated above, the single paediatric patient was a 16-year-old female. She had psoriasis for 
≥ 10 years and <20 years, a BMI of 22 kg/m2, and a 1st degree family history of psoriasis. She had 
received previous biological and non-biological drugs for psoriasis. 
Efficacy results 
The changes in PASI score were evaluated in the 59 patients with PASI score results among the 
82 patients in the efficacy analysis set. The mean (SD) PASI scores were 17.3 (16.0) at the start of 
treatment with Cosentyx, 3.6 (4.8) at Week 4, and 1.2 (2.0) at Week 16, showing decreases over time 
from Week 1 of treatment. The mean PASI score was maintained from Week 16 to Week 52 without 
major changes and was 0.8 (1.1) at Week 52. The mean (SE) percentage changes in PASI score were 
−28.1 (7.8) at Week 1, −54.8 (5.2) at Week 2, −73.5 (4.3) at Week 3, −75.2 (3.6) at Week 4, 
−90.2 (3.1) at Week 16 and −85.2 (5.1) at Week 52. The mean percentage change in PASI score 
decreased over time until Week 16 and was stable thereafter.

The PASI response rates were evaluated in 59 patients for which PASI scores were available at the 
start of treatment with Cosentyx and at the last evaluation. The PASI response rate showed increases 
from Week 1 of treatment to Week 16 and until Week 52. At Week 16, the PASI 75 response rate was 
89.2% (33/37 patients), the PASI 90 response rate was 75.7% (28/37 patients), and the 
PASI 100 response rate was 45.9% (17/37 patients). At Week 52, the PASI 75 response rate was 
76.9% (20/26 patients), the PASI 90 response rate was 65.4% (17/26 patients) and the 
PASI 100 response rate was 46.2% (12/26 patients). 
The changes in DLQI total score were evaluated in 47 patients for which DLQI total scores were 
available at the start of treatment with Cosentyx and at the last evaluation. For clarity, higher 
DLQI scores represent higher impairment in health-related quality of life. The mean DLQI total 
scores (SD) were 8.7 (7.0) at the start of treatment with Cosentyx, 4.8 (4.1) at Week 4, 3.3 (4.7) at 
Week 16 and 1.9 (2.1) at Week 52, showing decreases over time. The proportion of patients with 
a DLQI total score of 0 or 1 (no impairment) increased over time and was 17.0% (8/47 patients) at the 
start of treatment with Cosentyx, 30.8% (12/39 patients) at Week 4, 51.7% (15/29 patients) at 
Week 16, and 57.1% (8/14 patients) at Week 52. 
Severity assessments were based on the generalised pustular psoriasis severity criteria of the 
Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA). By JDA total score (category), the proportions of patients 
at the start of treatment with Cosentyx were: no symptom (remission) in 3.4% (2/59 patients), mild 
symptoms in 59.3% (35/59 patients), moderate symptoms in 23.7% (14/59 patients) and severe 
symptoms in 13.6% (8/59 patients). The proportion of patients without symptoms (remission) 
increased from 22.2% (8/36 patients) at Week 4 of treatment, to 36.7% (11/30 patients) at Week 16 
and to 47.8% (11/23 patients) at Week 52. The proportion of patients with mild symptoms were 
77.8% (28/36 patients) at Week 4, 63.3% (19/30 patients) at Week 16 and 52.2% (12/23 patients) at 
Week 52. At Week 12 and later, no patient was classified as moderate or severe. The mean JDA total 
score (SD) was 5.5 (4.0) at the start of treatment with Cosentyx and showed decreases over time from 
Week 1 to 1.7 (1.5) at Week 4 and 1.1 (1.2) at Week 16, with a further decrease to 0.8 (1.2) at 
Week 52. 
For global impression of change, patients started showing response (defined as “complete response” or 
“partial response”) at Week 1 of treatment. The response rate at Week 4 was 93.8% (60/64 patients), 
including 43.8% (28/64 patients) who achieved “complete response” and 50.0% (32/64 patients) who 
achieved “partial response”. The response rate at Week 16 was 94.4% (51/54 patients), including 
55.6% (30/54 patients) who achieved “complete response” and 38.9% (21/54 patients) who achieved 
“partial response”. The response rate at Week 52 was 90.0% (36/40 patients), including 
65.0% (26/40 patients) who achieved “complete response” and 25.0% (10/40 patients) who achieved 
“partial response”. 
Paediatric patient 
According to the MAH, the single paediatric patient enrolled into the study was not evaluable for 
efficacy, and no efficacy data has therefore been presented. For clarity, “not evaluable for efficacy” 
was defined as a patient who either had no global impression of change at all or who was not evaluable 
for global impression of change at all time points. 
Safety results 
The mean (SD) observation duration in the safety analysis set (n = 95) was 346 (65) days, and the 
observation durations were longer than 48 weeks in 87 patients (91.6%). The mean (SD) duration of 
treatment with Cosentyx was 278 (120) days and the median (min-max) was 344 (8-365) days.

Treatment duration was > 4 weeks for 87 patients (91.6%), > 16 weeks for 80 patients (84.2%), and 
> 48 weeks for 58 patients (61.1%). 
The initial dose of Cosentyx per administration was 300 mg in 90 patients (94.7%), and the most 
commonly used dose per administration was 300 mg in 92 patients (96.8%). The mean (SD) total 
number of Cosentyx doses was 13.1 (4.3). Self-administration was performed at least once in 
44 patients (46.3%) during the observation period. 
Most patients completed the observation period (52 weeks) and entered the follow-up period. The 
mean (SD) total observation duration including the follow-up period was 991 (278) days. Patients 
completed observation duration as follows: >52 weeks (87 patients, 91.6%), >104 weeks 
(85 patients, 89.5%), and >156 weeks (81 patients, 85.2%). 
In the safety analysis set, 9 patients (9.5%) discontinued the surveillance period for reasons including 
“failure to return before completion (including a hospital transfer)” in 5 patients (5.3%), “withdrawal of 
consent by the patient” in 3 patients (3.2%), and death in 1 patient (1.1%). The death occurred in 
a patient who developed hepatocellular carcinoma 149 days after the start of treatment with Cosentyx 
and died 1234 days (about 3.5 years) after the occurrence; the causal relationship with Cosentyx was 
considered not related by the investigator. 
Adverse events were reported in 49 patients (51.6%). The most commonly affected system organ 
class was Infections and Infestations, with an incidence of 16.8% (16 patients). Common AEs (≥ 3%) 
were reported as follows: pustular psoriasis (verbatim events: worsening of the underlying disease) in 
9 patients (9.5%), and folliculitis, oral candidiasis, interstitial lung disease, upper respiratory tract 
inflammation, rash and pyrexia in 3 patients (3.2%) each. The only AE reported in ≥ 3% of patients 
before Week 12 from the start of treatment was pyrexia in 3 patients (3.2%). 
The incidence of adverse events that led to Cosentyx discontinuation was 16.8% (16 patients). The 
adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation were pustular psoriasis (verbatim: worsening of 
the underlying disease) in 4.2% (4 patients), nasopharyngitis, pneumonia staphylococcal, sepsis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, interstitial lung disease, liver disorder, drug eruption, erythema, pruritus, 
rash, drug ineffective, therapeutic response decreased, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell 
count decreased, and KL-6 increased in 1.1% (1 patient) each. The outcomes were resolved or 
resolving except for hepatocellular carcinoma, for which the outcome was death (see above). 
Serious AEs were reported in 12 patients (12.6%). There was no event that occurred in ≥ 2 patients, 
and the serious AEs included oral candidiasis, pneumonia staphylococcal, sepsis, septic shock, 
tonsillitis, breast cancer stage II, pancreatic carcinoma recurrent, hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenal 
insufficiency, colitis ulcerative, intestinal obstruction, erythema, pruritus and pyrexia in 
1 patient (1.1%) each. The outcomes of the serious AEs were resolved or resolving except for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (death; see above for details), breast cancer stage II, pancreatic carcinoma 
recurrent, and intestinal obstruction (unknown). 
For this study, adverse reactions were defined as AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to 
Cosentyx. Adverse reactions were reported in 34 patients (35.8%). The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions (≥ 3%) were as follows: pustular psoriasis (verbatim events: worsening of the 
underlying disease) in 4 patients (4.2%), and oral candidiasis and rash in 3 patients (3.2%) each. 
In the 34 patients with adverse reactions, the most common time of the first occurrence was “≤ 4 
weeks” in 11 patients, followed by “> 4 weeks to ≤ 16 weeks” in 6 patients. Thus, adverse reactions 
first occurred within 16 weeks from the start of treatment in approximately half of the patients. There 
was no adverse reaction that occurred uniquely in one specific time category.

Serious adverse reactions (serious AE suspected by the investigator to be related to Cosentyx) were 
reported in 6 patients (6.3%). They included oral candidiasis, pneumonia staphylococcal, sepsis, septic 
shock, breast cancer stage II, colitis ulcerative, erythema and pruritus in 1 patient each (1.1%). 
Occurrence of adverse events and adverse reactions of the priority investigation items in the safety 
analysis set (n = 95) during the observation period are summarised in Table 2.3.2.1.

Table 2.3.2.1  Data on the occurrence of priority investigation items (adverse events and adverse 
reactions) (by priority investigation item, PT) (safety analysis set) 
Adverse events and adverse reactions of “serious infections” were reported in 4 patients (4.2%) and 
3 patients (3.2%), respectively. Median (min-max) time to onset (first occurrence) was 
54 (11-170) days. The outcomes in these 3 patients were resolved or resolving and the median 
(min-max) time to resolved or resolving was 33 (28-129) days. During the follow-up period, a “serious 
infection” occurred, which was pneumonia aspiration (1 patient). This event occurred at 1.006 days

from the start of treatment (986 days from the most recent dosing) and was resolving at 18 days after 
the occurrence following hospitalisation/prolongation of existing hospitalisation. This event was 
assessed to be serious, but not causally associated with Cosentyx. 
Adverse events and adverse reactions of “neutropenia” (comprising events of neutrophil count 
decreased and white blood cell count decreased) were reported in 2 patients (2.1%); times to onset 
were 29 and 32 days. Both events were reported as resolved or resolving, and times to resolved or 
resolving were 67 and 237 days. 
Adverse events and adverse reactions of “fungal infections” were reported in 8 patients (8.4%) and 
6 patients (6.3%), respectively. Median (min-max) time to onset (first occurrence) was 
142 (92-337) days. The outcomes in these 6 patients were resolved or resolving, with a median 
(min-max) time to resolved or resolving of 85 (15-162) days. 
Adverse events and adverse reactions of “hypersensitivity reactions” were reported in 
6 patients (6.3%) and 5 patients (5.2%), respectively. Median (min-max) time to onset (first 
occurrence) was 132 (8-311) days. The outcomes in these 5 patients were all resolved or resolving, 
with a median (min-max) time to resolved or resolving of 24 (8-71) days (population for calculation: 
4 patients). 
Adverse events and adverse reactions of “malignant tumours” were reported in 3 patients (3.2%) and 
1 patient (1.1%), respectively. The adverse reaction (breast cancer stage II) occurred 21 days from 
the start of treatment with Cosentyx (1 day from the most recent dosing) and was assessed to be 
serious. The outcome following actions (follow-up, changes made to concomitant drugs etc., 
hospitalisation/prolongation of existing hospitalisation) was unknown. Cosentyx was not resumed after 
follow-up and the total number of doses was 4 times. During the follow-up period, an event of 
“malignant tumours” (small intestine carcinoma) occurred, in the same patient that developed breast 
cancer stage II during the observation period. This event occurred at 374 days from the start of 
treatment with Cosentyx (354 days from the most recent dosing). The outcome following actions 
(changes made to concomitant drugs etc., hospitalisation/prolongation of existing hospitalisation) was 
unknown. This event was assessed by the investigator as serious and related to Cosentyx. 
The adverse event and adverse reaction of “inflammatory bowel disease” was colitis ulcerative reported 
in 1 patient (1.1%). Time to onset (first occurrence) was 54 days, the outcome was resolved and the 
number of days to resolved was 40 days. 
The adverse event and adverse reaction of “cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events” were both 
hypertension in 2 patients (2.1%). Times to onset (first occurrence) were 1 day and 227 days, the 
outcomes for both were reported as resolving and the numbers of days to resolving were 29 days and 
99 days. 
A factorial analysis of adverse event and adverse reaction data based on various baseline 
characteristics (such as age, sex, body weight, disease duration, medical history, prior use of 
biologicals) identified no particular trends. 
Paediatric patient 
The 16-year-old paediatric patient initiated treatment with Cosentyx at 300 mg with no dose increases 
or reductions. The patient had an administration duration of 344 days and received 16 doses of 
Cosentyx with no self-administration. According to the MAH, no AEs were reported for this paediatric 
patient during the surveillance period.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study reported within the current submission was a non-interventional surveillance study 
developed and carried out by the MAH to collect safety and efficacy data from the patient population 
that received Cosentyx after the approval of a supplemental application for the new indication of 
pustular psoriasis. The study design and execution in themselves seem typical for a non-interventional 
surveillance study, with no unusual features. For purposes of assessment from the perspective of 
Article 46, the overall relevance of the study is very limited, as it primarily enrolled an adult population 
in accordance with the authorised use. No patients under the age of 15 years (Japanese definition of 
paediatric patients) were enrolled, but one 16-year-old patient was enrolled and was thus considered 
a paediatric patient as per the EU definition. 
The reported study was a small, uncontrolled non-interventional survey, and as such, very limited 
conclusions can overall be drawn from the results. Moreover, pustular psoriasis is not an authorised 
indication for secukinumab in the EU. Recognising these inherent limitations, it can nevertheless be 
generally noted that the reported results are broadly consistent with previous results from controlled 
clinical studies with secukinumab in other indications, and there are no new findings or observations of 
concern. The safety findings are also appropriately addressed in existing EU Product Information for 
secukinumab, and no updates are warranted. In terms of paediatric use, the reported survey assessed 
adult patients, and no conclusions relevant to Article 46 can be made based on a single treated 
adolescent patient. Overall, the results of the study do not change the benefit-risk profile of 
secukinumab. 
The MAH has concluded that the surveillance results do not show any new safety concerns for 
Cosentyx in long-term treatment. In addition, because Cosentyx showed long-term efficacy in patients 
with pustular psoriasis also in clinical use, additional safety measures are considered unnecessary. The 
MAH’s conclusion is endorsed.

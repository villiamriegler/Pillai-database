SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
BPH is a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate due to cellular hyperplasia of both glandular and 
stromal elements. As the prostate increases in size it may exert pressure on the lumen of the prostatic 
urethra, resulting in a gradual obstruction to urine flow. The manifestation and severity of the disease 
vary and BPH does not always progress to cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Studies have 
shown that urinary flow rate and prostate size usually do not correlate with the severity and number of 
symptoms, which vary from subject to subject. The prevalence of BPH increases with age, especially 
after the fifth decade. On the basis of autopsy studies, BPH prevalence is 8% in men aged 31 to 40 
years, 40 to 50% in men aged 51 to 60 years and >80% in men aged >80 years. In subjects with LUTS 
suggestive  of  BPH,  both  an  obstructive  and  a  storage  component  contribute  to  the  symptoms  and 
impairment  of  outflow.  The  obstructive  component  relates  primarily  to  the  increased  size  of  the 
prostate, and the storage component relates to the tone of the smooth muscle in the prostatic capsule 
and  stroma.  The  aim  of  therapy  is  to  improve  LUTS  and  quality  of  life  (QOL)  and  to  prevent 
complications, such as urinary retention or upper urinary tract dilatation. Initial management of men 
with LUTS can be categorised into 1) watchful waiting, 2) medical therapy, and 3) surgical treatment. 
Medical  therapy  may  consist  of  the  use  of  5  α-reductase  inhibitors  (finasteride,  dutasteride)  or  α-
adrenoreceptor antagonists (terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, prazosin, alfuzosin). 
The  active  substance  of  Urorec  is  silodosin.  Silodosin  is  an  α1-adrenoreceptor  antagonist  that 
selectively affects the prostate, the urethra, and the trigone of the urinary bladder in the lower urinary 
tract as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH).  
This  application  is  made  via  a  centralised  procedure  according  to  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
Article 3(2)(a), i.e. new active substance. The application is submitted in accordance with the Article 
8(3)  in  Directive  2001/83/EC,  i.e.  new  active  substance,  full  dossier.  The  initial  indication  at  the 
submission was: “Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)”. 
No formal scientific advice had been given by the CHMP. No regulatory guidance on the investigation 
of products for the treatment of signs and symptoms of BPH is available. 
The  claimed  indication  was:  “Treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia 
(BPH)”. 
The  approved  indication  is:  “Treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia 
(BPH)”. The recommended dose is one capsule of Urorec 8 mg daily. For special patient populations, 
one capsule of Urorec 4 mg daily is recommended. 
There is no paediatric development programme for silodosin. A class waiver on conditions, granted for 
products intended to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia has been issued by the EMEA.

2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Urorec  is  presented  in  the  form  of  hard  capsules  containing  4  mg  and  8  mg  of  silodosin  as  active 
substance.  The  other  ingredients  are  mannitol,  pregelatinised  starch,  purified  water,  sodium  lauril 
sulfate and magnesium stearate. Other ingredients of the capsule shell are gelatine, titanium dioxide 
and colourants. 
The hard capsules are marketed in polyvinylchloride (PVC)/polyvinylidenchloride (PVDC)/aluminium 
foil blisters, packed in carton packs. 
Active Substance  
The drug substance is silodosin its chemical name is (-)-1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-5-[(2R)-2-({2-[2-(2,2,2-
trifluoroethoxy)phenoxy]ethyl}amino)propyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-7-carboxamide according to the 
IUPAC nomenclature. 
Silodosin  is  a  white  to  pale  yellowish  white  powder  and  it  is  odorless.  Silodosin  can  exist  in  three 
polymorphic forms. The forms can be differentiated by  IR, PXRD and solid-state  13C-NMR. A well 
defined polymorph was selected to manufacture the finished product. Silodosin is not considered to be 
hygroscopic and it is very soluble in acetic acid, freely soluble in methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide 
(DMF), and ethanol, sparingly soluble in 1-octanol, and very slightly soluble in water. It was verified 
that this active substance is soluble in various buffers at acidic pH but very slightly at alkaline pH. The 
above-mentioned active substance has one chiral centre and is used as a single enantiomer (R).

•  Manufacture 
Silodosin  is  synthesised  in  five  reactions  steps.  The  active  substance  is  manufactured  by  two 
manufacturers.  However,  it  is  important  to  underline  that  the  synthetic  process  and  controls  on  the 
active substance are the same for the two sources of silodosin. The manufacturing process has been 
adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls 
included.  Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents,  and  solvents  have  been  provided.  Adequate 
control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  has  been  presented.  The  active  substance  is  purified  by 
recrystallisation and the crystallised active substance is finally milled.  
infrared  absorption 
Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  ultraviolet  spectroscopy, 
two 
spectroscopy, 
dimensional NMR spectroscopy (COSY, NOESY, HMCQ and HMBC), mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS 
and  ESI-MS/MS)  and  optical  rotation.  The  proposed  molecular  structure  was  confirmed  by  X-ray 
single crystal structural analysis.

•  Specification 
The  active  substance  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance  (white  to  pale  yellowish  white 
powder), identification (IR, fluoride, mp), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), impurities 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph.Eur.) and residual solvents (Ph.Eur.).

All specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods, 
which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance 
with the relevant ICH Guidelines.   
Impurities were described, classified as process-related impurities and possible degradation products, 
and  qualified.  All  potential  genotoxic  impurities  were  discussed  and  are  below  the  qualification 
threshold.  Residual  solvents  were  satisfactorily  controlled  in  the  active  substance  according  to  the 
relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of analyses for  the active  substances for both  manufacturers 
were  provided  and  all  batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  specifications  and  show  a  good 
uniformity from batch to batch.  
•  Stability 
Three  pilot-plant  batches  from  each  manufacturer  of  the  active  substance  were  put  on  long-term 
condition  (25±2°C/60±5%RH),  and  accelerated  condition  (40±2°C/75±5%RH).  At  present,  the 
stability studies for three production scale batches from each manufacturer of silodosin are currently 
being performed in accordance with the protocol. 
All stability studies were completed according to ICH guidelines and demonstrated adequate stability 
of  the  active  substance.  The  following  parameters  were  monitored  during  the  stability  studies: 
appearance,  identification  (IR),  impurities  (HPLC),  optical  isomer  (S-isomer),  water  content, 
polymorphic form, microbial limits. 
The same analytical methods have been used in the stability programme as for release. In addition, the 
stability  studies  included  a  specific  control  of  polymorphic  form  using  an  X-ray  powder  diffraction 
and the determination of microbial content. 
Based  on  the  stability  results  it  was concluded  that the  proposed  re-test  period is justified  when the 
active substance is stored in the original packing material and protected from light. 
Medicinal Product  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified.  
The  main  aim  of the formulation  development  was  to  obtain a  composition  with  good  homogeneity 
and performance (disintegration and dissolution) characteristics.  
The manufacturer developed silodosin 8 mg capsules with a content which is proportionally similar in 
its  active  and  inactive  ingredients  to  the  4  mg  capsules  already  marketed  in  Japan  by  Kissei  and 
utilised also by Watson. It was noted that there were no changes in the manufacture of the blend of the 
two strengths. 
Silodosin 8 mg capsules developed were used in Phase I and Phase III clinical studies.  
Comparative dissolution profiles were obtained for the 4 mg and 8 mg capsules using three different 
dissolution media pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8. Based on the disintegration data and dissolution results provided 
and according to the “Note of Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence” 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  the  applicant  justified  the  absence  of  an  in-vivo  test  to  demonstrate  the 
equivalence of the different capsules formulations. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
Neither the excipients nor the active substance is derived from human or animal origin. Certificates of 
Suitability were provided for the gelatine capsule which is of ruminant origin. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard 
manufacturing processes such as mixing, granulation, sieving and capsule filling. 
Page 6 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It  was  noted  that  the  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  was 
demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process. 
The  proposed  commercial  process  was  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  manufacturing 
process. The batch analysis data show that the medicinal product can be manufactured reproducibly 
according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of the capsules. 
•  Product Specification 
The  drug  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the 
following  tests:  appearance,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.),  identification  (HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph.Eur.), titanium dioxide identification (4 mg & 8 mg), iron 
oxide identification (4 mg) and microbial limits (Ph Eur). 
All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  finished  product  were  properly  described. 
Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH 
guidelines.  
Batch analysis data on five (one lab and four pilot scale) batches of silodosin 4 mg and three (one lab 
and  two  pilot  scale)  batches  of  silodosin  8  mg  confirms  satisfactory  uniformity  of  the  product  at 
release. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The stability studies were conducted according to the ICH guideline. Two lab batches and four pilot 
batches for  silodosin  4  mg  have  been  stored  at long  term  (25±2°C/60±5%RH);  two  lab  batches  and 
four pilot batches for silodosin 4 mg have been stored at intermediate conditions (30°C ± 2°C/65% RH 
±  5%  RH)  and  two  lab  batches  and  four  pilot  batches  for  silodosin  4  mg  have  been  stored  at 
accelerated  (40°C±2°C,  75  ±5%RH) conditions in  the  proposed  market  packaging.  Two  lab  batches 
and two pilot batches for silodosin 8 mg have been stored at long term (25±2°C/60±5%RH); two lab 
batches and two pilot batches for silodosin 8 mg have been stored at intermediate conditions (30°C ± 
2°C/65% RH ± 5% RH) and two lab batches and two pilot batches for silodosin 8 mg have been stored 
at accelerated (40°C±2°C, 75 ±5%RH) conditions in the proposed market packaging. 
The  following  parameters  were  controlled:  appearance,  assay, 
microbiological contamination. 
One  pilot  batch  of  each  strength  was  stored  under  ICH  photostability  conditions  and  no  significant 
changes were observed.  
Based  on  the  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the 
SmPC are acceptable.

Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH 
guidelines.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the 
finished  product.  Therefore,  this  medicinal  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in the clinic. 
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Silodosin is an α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) blocker that selectively affects the prostate, urethra, and 
trigone of the urinary bladder in the lower urinary tract as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of the 
signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  
During development of the product, several morphological forms of the drug substance were used. The 
drug substance used in the pharmacology studies was the selected crystalline form of silodosin (KMD 
3213).  In  the  pharmacokinetic  studies,  the  selected  crystalline  form  of  silodosin  administered  in  a 
capsule was used in a single oral administration study in dogs. A suspension solution of the selected 
Page 7 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crystalline form of silodosin containing a small amount of another form was used in the 7-day repeat-
dose oral administration study in which the effect of silodosin on hepatic drug metabolic enzymes was 
studied. All toxicity studies were conducted using the selected crystalline form of silodosin, with the 
exception of part of the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, which were conducted using 
a  mixture  of  the  selected  crystalline  form  and  another  form  of  silodosin.  There  were  no  differences 
between the selected crystals and the other utilised crystals in physicochemical characteristics such as 
solubility, stability in water, and melting point. 
Silodosin  metabolites  were  evaluated  in  several  studies  in  order  to  characterise  their  pharmacology 
and toxicity. 
GLP aspects  
Pivotal  core  safety  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics  and  toxicology  studies  were 
conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice.  
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
An  extensive  programme  of  pharmacology  studies  has  been  performed;  of  which  only  the  pivotal 
studies have been included in this assessment report.  
In vitro studies 
Affinity  for  human  α1-AR  subtypes  was  assessed  in  a  receptor  binding  study  using  membrane 
fractions of mouse-derived LM(tk-) cells in which each of three human α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) 
subtypes (α1A-,  α1B-  and  α1D-ARs)  were expressed.  Silodosin  showed a  high  affinity  for  α1A-AR 
subtype  (pKi  value:  10.4).  The  selectivity  of  silodosin  for  α1A-AR  subtype  was  162  times  and  55 
times  higher  than  for  subtypes  α1B-AR  and  α1D-AR,  respectively.  The  selectivity  of  silodosin  for 
subtype  α1A-AR  was  higher  compared  to  other  α1-AR  blockers  tested,  including  tamsulosin 
hydrochloride,  prazosin  hydrochloride,  and  terazosin  hydrochloride.  The  affinity  for  the  α1A-AR 
subtype was highest with tamsulosin hydrochloride, followed by silodosin, prazosin hydrochloride and 
terazosin hydrochloride.  
Another  study  examined  silodosin  actions  on  noradrenaline-induced  contractions  in  various  isolated 
tissues.  Silodosin  showed  antagonism  to  noradrenaline-induced  contraction  in  lower  urinary  tract 
tissues of rabbits including the prostate, urethra and trigone of the bladder (α1A-AR) with pA2 or pKb 
of 9.60, 8.71 and 9.35, respectively. The pA2 of the antagonism to noradrenaline-induced contraction 
for silodosin in the isolated rat spleen (α1B-AR) and isolated rat thoracic aorta (α1D-AR) were 7.15 
and 7.88, respectively. The selectivity of silodosin for the prostate was approximately 280-fold higher 
than that for spleen and approximately 50-fold higher than that for the thoracic aorta, indicating high 
selectivity of the compound for the lower urinary tract tissues. 
In vivo studies 
The effects of silodosin on the increase in urethral pressure and mean blood pressure in rats induced 
by phenylephrine (a α1-AR agonist agent), were investigated in vivo. The characteristics of the effects 
were compared with those of other α1-AR blockers. Intravenous silodosin (0.3-300 µg/kg) suppressed 
the phenylephrine-induced increase in urethral pressure by approximately 50% at doses of 1 µg/kg and 
higher  and  decreased  blood  pressure  by  approximately  15%  at  doses  of  10  µg/kg  and  higher  in 
anaesthetised  rats.  Tamsulosin  hydrochloride,  prazosin  hydrochloride  and  terazosin  hydrochloride, 
also  inhibited  phenylephrine-induced  increases  in  urethral  pressure  and  decreased  blood  pressure, 
although  the  required  doses  of  the  three  compounds  were  lower  than  that  of  silodosin.  The  three 
compounds  also  showed  a  greater  effect  on  blood  pressure  compared  to  silodosin.  Similarly,  after 
intraduodenal  administration  silodosin  (0.003-3  mg/kg)  dose-dependently  inhibited  phenylephrine-
induced increases in urethral pressure and showed hypotensive effects at higher doses in anaesthetised 
rats. 
Page 8 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In another study, effects of silodosin and tamsulosin at doses of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 mg/kg IV on rat 
benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  model  were  assessed.  Both,  silodosin  and  tamsulosin  hydrochloride,  at 
doses of 0.01 mg/kg and higher, inhibited overactive bladder-like symptoms.  
The active substance has a chiral centre. The CHMP has expressed a concern regarding the possibility 
of  in  vivo  chiral  conversion  of  silodosin  and  its  metabolites.  In  their  responses  the  applicant  has 
referred to data from the phase I clinical study (98364) which showed that the chiral centre was not a 
target  for  metabolic  reactions  and  no  inversion  was  detected  in  any  sample  indicating  that  in  vivo 
isomerisation of silodosin did not occur in humans. 
Metabolites 
The glucuronide conjugate of silodosin (KMD 3213G) and a metabolite KMD 3293 were detected as 
the  major  metabolites  in  human  plasma.  KMD  3213G  was  not  detected  in  animal  plasma.  KMD 
3213G had 1/8 times the affinity of silodosin for human α1A-AR. In animals, this human metabolite 
had 1/4.5 and 1/35 times the affinity of silodosin for α1A-AR subtype in rat mandibular gland and for 
α1B-AR subtype in rat liver, respectively, and approximately 1/2 the inhibitory effect on contraction 
induced  by  noradrenaline  in  the  isolated  prostate  in  rats,  and  not  more  than  1/10  of  silodosin 
transferability  to  the  prostate.  KMD  3293  was  detected  in  animal  plasma  and  had  1/42  times  the 
affinity of silodosin for subtype α1A-AR in humans.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
A receptor binding study was conducted using animal tissues and cells expressing human receptors, 
i.e. rat cerebral cortex and rat striatum and human β2-AR, dopamine (D1, D2 long and D4.2) receptors 
expressed in Sf9 cells and rat dopamine D3 receptor expressed in Sf9 cells. Silodosin’s affinity for β2-
AR (pKi: 8.25) was almost equal to that for α1D-AR subtype (pKi: 8.66) and α1B-AR subtype (pKi: 
8.19),  but  it  showed  affinity  only  at  high  concentrations  for  α2-  and  β1-AR,  muscarinic  receptor, 
serotonin  (5-HT1)  receptor  and  dopamine  (D1,  D2  long,  D3  and  D4.2)  receptors.  In  general,  the 
affinities of silodosin for other receptor subtypes were lower than that for α1A-AR.  
The affinity of silodosin for β2-AR was determined in the functional pharmacological study using a 
uterus specimen  isolated from  pregnant rats.  Silodosin’s affinity for  β2-AR  was  approximately  140-
fold lower than for α1A-AR subtype, and the concentration required to obtain action on the pregnant 
uterus was higher than that required to obtain action on the prostate. In this study silodosin showed no 
agonist action on β2-AR and demonstrated an antagonistic action at 3×10-6 mol/L and above. 
Metabolites 
The  affinity  for  receptors  other  than  α1-AR  was  assessed  in  order  to  determine  pharmacological 
characteristics of the glucuronide conjugate of silodosin (KMD 3213G) and KMD 3293, the two main 
metabolites in humans. The pKi values of KMD 3213G and KMD 3293 were less than 7 for all of the 
receptors other than α1-AR (see table).

•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Central Nervous System 
The effects of silodosin on the central nervous system were assessed in male Wistar rats (10/group) by 
the functional observational battery (FOB) test. Orally administered silodosin showed no effects on the 
central nervous system at doses up to 2 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg, marked decreases in arousal, as well as 
tremors,  in  2  of  10  animals  were  noted  at  the  highest  dose.  Decreases  in  body  temperature  of 
approximately 1°C were observed at 0.5 to 4 h after this dose.  
Respiratory System 
In  conscious  male  beagle  dogs  (n=5),  blood  haemoglobin  oxygen  saturation,  oxygen  and  carbon 
dioxide partial pressures and pH were measured as indicators of the depth of respiration. Silodosin had 
no effect on these parameters after a single oral dose at 0.2, 2 and 20 mg/kg (washout period between 
doses  –  1  week).  Transient  increases  in  respiratory  rate  were  noted  at  4  h  after  administration  at  2 
mg/kg  and  at  3  and  6  h  after  administration  at  the  high  dose.  However,  there  was  no  effect  on  the 
depth of respiration at these doses. The increase in respiratory rate was not considered to be a direct 
action of silodosin on respiratory function. 
Cardiovascular System 
The hERG (human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene) tail current using HEK293 cells was determined at 
concentrations  of  1×10-7,  3×10-7,  1×10-6,  3×10-6  and  1×10-5  mol/L.  The  hERG  tail  current  was 
inhibited  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner  at  1×10-6  mol/L  and  higher,  with  an  IC50  value  of 
8.91×10-6 mol/L. 
In  male  Hartley  guinea  pigs  myocardial  action  potential  waveform  in  the  papillary  muscle  was 
investigated at concentrations of 1×10-7, 1×10-6 and 1×10-5 mol/L. The duration of 90% repolarisation 
of action potential (APD90) was prolonged by 6.4% and 17.1% at concentrations of 1×10-6 and 1×10-5 
mol/L, respectively. 
Conscious male beagle dogs (n=7) were used to evaluate blood pressure, heart rate and ECG after a 
single  oral  administration  of  silodosin  at  0.2,  2  and  20  mg/kg  (washout  period  of  7  days  between 
doses).  Silodosin  did  not  show  any  effect  on  heart  rate  and  ECG  at  20  mg/kg.  A  decrease  in  blood 
pressure  was  observed,  which  was  attributable  to  α1-AR  antagonistic  effect.  Transient  decreases  in 
mean blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (by 12% and 16%, respectively) were observed at 1 
h post-dose at 0.2 mg/kg. At 2 mg/kg, transient decreases in mean blood pressure and diastolic blood 
pressure  (by  13%  and  12%,  respectively)  were  observed  at  1  h,  and  a  decrease  in  systolic  blood 
pressure  (by  up  to  18%)  was  observed  at  1  to  6  h.  After  administration  of  20  mg/kg  a  decrease  in 
systolic blood pressure (by up to 24%) at 0.5 to 8 h, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (by up to 
22%) at 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h, and a decrease in mean blood pressure (by up to 23%) at 0.5 to 8 h were 
also observed. These effects were resolved by 24 h after administration 
Metabolites 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  on  KMD  3213G,  the  main  metabolite  in  humans  that 
was not detected in animal plasma. KMD-3213G did not show any effect on the central nervous (rats), 
respiratory (dogs) and cardiovascular (dogs) systems after intravenous injections up to the dose of 3 
mg/kg.  In addition, no effect on hERG tail current and myocardial action potential waveform in the 
papillary  muscle  isolated  from  guinea  pigs  at  concentrations  up  to  1×10-5  mol/L  was  observed.  See 
below for further discussion. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted. Drug interactions 
were examined in clinical studies hence the absence of non-clinical data can be accepted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of silodosin (KMD 3213) were studied using 
non-labelled silodosin and radiolabelled silodosin (14CKMD 3213) in ICR mice, Sprague Dawley rats 
Page 10 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Beagle dogs. Oral dosing was used as the main route of administration for these studies, as this is 
the  intended  clinical  route.  Studies  using  intravenous  administration  were  also  performed  to 
investigate bioavailability (BA). 
The data presented below refer to rat and dog pharmacokinetic studies as those species were used also 
in toxicology studies.  
In  the  rat  (oral)  dose  studies,  radiolabelled  silodosin,  was  dissolved  in  dilute  hydrochloric  acid, 
followed  by  dilution  with  a  0.5%  aqueous  solution  of  methylcellulose.  For  the  intravenous  studies, 
radiolabelled  silodosin  was  dissolved  in  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  followed  by  dilution  with 
physiological  saline.  In  the  rat  enzyme  induction  study,  non-labelled  silodosin  was  suspended  in  a 
0.5% aqueous solution of methylcellulose.  
In the dog (oral) dose studies, radiolabelled silodosin, was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and 
filled  into  capsules.  For  the  oral  dose  of  non-labelled  silodosin  in  dogs,  silodosin  was  filled  into 
capsules, while the salt of silodosin (KMD 3213•2HBr), dissolved in saline was used in intravenous 
injection studies.  For the clinical  pharmacological  study  (mass  balance), radiolabelled  silodosin  was 
dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and administered orally. 
Absorption 
Single dose 
In rats and dogs after single oral doses (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg in rats; 0.5 mg/kg in dogs) under fasting 
conditions  silodosin  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  Tmax  of  0.10-0.15  and  0.88  hour,  respectively.  In 
rodents, the Cmax and AUC of silodosin increased dose-dependently but were not dose-proportional at 
higher  levels,  i.e.  following  0.3  mg/kg  the  Cmax  was  9.3  ng/ml  and  AUC0-∞  was  6.9  ng*hr/ml, 
following 1.0 mg/kg the Cmax was 28.7 ng/ml and AUC0-∞ was 27.9 ng*hr/ml, following 3.0 mg/kg 
the Cmax was 202 ng/ml and AUC0-∞ was 170 ng*hr/ml. In the dog following the single dose of 0.5 
mg/kg  the  Cmax  was  37.6  ng/ml  and  AUC0-∞  was  97.3  ng*hr/ml.  The  oral  bioavailability  was 
approximately  9%  in  rats  and  25%  in  dogs.  Plasma  concentrations  of  silodosin  were  also  measured 
after a single oral dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg under non-fasting conditions in the dog. Results showed 
that  the  exposure  (AUC0-24  and  Cmax)  after  higher  doses  of  silodosin  did  not  increase  dose-
proportionally. 
In rats after single intravenous doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg under non-fasting conditions, the 
CLtot and Vd were 55.1 to 71.7 ml/min/kg and 4.7 to 11.4 L/kg, respectively. In dogs the CLtot and 
Vd after an intravenous injection of silodosin under fasting conditions were 22.3 mL/min/kg and 3.1 
L/kg, respectively. The CLtot was nearly identical to the hepatic blood flow indicating hepatic blood 
flow-limiting pharmacokinetic. 
The measurements of the plasma radioactivity of 14C-silodosin performed after a single oral dose (1 
mg/kg, under fasting and non fasting conditions) and a single intravenous injection (1 mg/kg, under 
fasting conditions) in male Sprague Dawley rats suggested that food intake decreased the absorption of 
silodosin. 
When exposure (Cmax and AUC) was compared between rats, dogs, and humans after a single oral 
dose,  Cmax  at  1  mg/kg  in  rats  and  0.5  mg/kg  in  dogs  corresponded  to  4  mg  in  humans  (half  the 
recommended clinical dose of 8 mg per day). The AUC at 3 mg/kg in rats was approximately 1.3- to 
1.5-fold higher than in humans after a single oral dose of 4 mg, while the AUC at a 0.5 mg/kg in dogs 
was approximately 1.2- to 2.1-fold lower compared to humans after a single oral dose of 4 mg 
Repeat dose 
In repeat-dose (14-day) oral studies in rats, AUC and Cmax generally increased in a dose-dependent 
manner reaching 163-203 ng*h/ml and 13 ng/ml after 15 mg/kg/day, 942-1194  ng*h/ml and 81-106 
ng/ml after 50 mg/kg/day, and 2947-3078 ng*h/ml and 228-352ng/ml after 150 mg/kg/day. In 14-day 
study in dogs the AUC and Cmax values after administration of 80 mg/kg/day of silodosin were higher 
in males compared to females - 36977 ng*h/ml  vs. 22065 ng*h/ml and 5303 ng/ml vs. 3477 ng/ml, 
respectively. Similarly, in longer pharmacokinetic studies (1-month studies in rats and dogs, 26-week 
study in rats, 13- and 52-week study in dogs) the PK indices tended to increase dose-proportionally. 
Silodosin was absorbed from the entire small intestine. Reabsorption by the enterohepatic circulation 
was also observed.

Metabolites  
In single dose studies in rats dose-proportional AUC and Cmax increases in metabolites KMD 3241 
and 3289 were noted, while AUC0-24 for KMD 3295 increased more than dose-proportionally. The 
AUC0-24 was slightly lower in females. KMD 3295 was not detected in females and was detected at a 
low level in males. KMD 3293 was detected both in males and females but at low levels. In dogs after 
single oral dose exposure to KMD 3241 did not increase dose-proportionally, while dose-proportional 
increases in exposure to KMD 3289 and 3293 were noted. In repeat dose studies in rats KMD 3241, 
KMD 3289, KMD 3293, and KMD 3295 were detected in the plasma and showed the same biphasic 
elimination  as  silodosin.  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  values  of  metabolites  increased  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner.  In  dogs  plasma  concentrations  and  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  males  were  higher  than 
those of the females. The order of metabolites starting with the highest concentration was: silodosin > 
KMD 3241 > KMD 3289 > KMD 3293 > KMD 3295.  
Distribution 
In rats after a single intravenous injection (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg), t1/2 was 2.4 to 3.2 h. After a 
single  oral  dose  (0.3,  1  and  3  mg/kg)  t1/2  was  1.5  to  2.0  h.  The  t1/2  after  a  single  oral  dose  and  a 
single intravenous injection were 2.0 and 3.3 h, respectively in the dog, indicating rapid elimination 
from plasma.  
In rats, following the single dose of 1 mg/kg, the radioactivity was widely distributed to the organs and 
tissues, and it was detected most prevalently in the liver, kidney, spleen, the gastrointestinal tract and 
bladder. Low radioactivity was detected in the central nervous system except for the pituitary gland. 
Radioactivity  in  plasma  peaked  at  4  h  post-dose.  By  168  h  post-dose  plasma  levels  of  radioactivity 
were below the limit of detection suggesting no retention of radioactivity over a long period occurred 
in blood cells. A repeat-dose 21-day study with radiolabelled silodosin at 1 mg/kg/day has provided 
similar results. 
The binding ratio of silodosin to human plasma proteins was 94.6% to 95.8%, which was higher than 
that in rats and dogs (80%). The binding ratios of KMD 3213G and KMD 3293, the major metabolites 
of silodosin in humans, were 91.2-92.0% and 90.2-91.9%, respectively. Silodosin, KMD 3213G and 
KMD  3293  bind  predominantly  to  α1  acid  glycoprotein  in  human  plasma.  Silodosin  was  associated 
with blood cells at 30% to 60% of the administered dose in rat and dog plasma and not greater than 
5% in human plasma. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies 
In  vitro  studies  using  rat,  dog,  monkey,  and  human  hepatocytes  showed  that  KMD  3293  and  KMD 
3213G were predominantly synthesised in human hepatocytes accounting for approximately 43% and 
36% of the administered radioactivity. KMD 3293 was produced in all animal species tested as well as 
humans, whereas KMD 3213G was generated in humans and monkeys.  
In vivo studies 
Radiolabelled  silodosin  (1  mg/kg)  was  administered  in  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  and  levels  of 
metabolite radioactivity were measured in plasma and various organs and tissues. Metabolites in urine, 
faeces and bile collected 24 h after were also measured. The main metabolites were KMD 3310, KMD 
3250,  KMD  3295  and  KMD  3241.  KMD  3310  was  the  most  predominant  metabolite  in  plasma 
(74.7%) urine (38%), kidney (69%) and prostate (54%) and the second predominant metabolite in the 
liver (22%) after 30 minutes post-administration. KMD 3250 was the most predominant metabolite in 
the  liver  (25%),  bile  (26%)  and  faeces  (32%).  KMD  3295  was  detected  in  bile  (16%),  while  KMD 
3241 in prostate (19%) and kidney (11%).  
KMD  3213G,  the  main  metabolite  in  humans,  was  detected  in  the  rat  liver  (≤  7%  of  the  hepatic 
radioactivity). KMD 3293 was also found in the rat liver (≤ 3% of liver and bile radioactivity). 
In dogs after a single oral dose of radiolabelled silodosin (0.5 mg/kg) metabolites in plasma, urine and 
faeces were measured. The main metabolite detected in plasma collected between 15 min and 4 h after 
administration was KMD 3310 (73.1 to 95.3%). KMD 3213G (the main metabolite in humans) was 
Page 12 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not detected in plasma at any time point. KMD 3293 and KMD 3295 were detected in plasma at 1 and 
1.5 h after administration (0.5% and 0.3%). KMD 3241 was present in the plasma at most sampling 
times and did not account for more than 4% of the radioactivity. In urine (24 h post dose), the major 
metabolite was KMD 3310 (82%). Metabolites KMD 3293 and KMD 3295 accounted for less than 1% 
of the dose, and KMD 3241 was not detected. In faeces (24 h post dose), KMD 3293 and KMD 3295 
accounted  for  approximately  29%  and  24%  of  the  radioactivity,  respectively.  In  faeces  collected 
between  24  and  48  h  after  administration, KMD  3293  and KMD  3295  accounted  for approximately 
35% and 24%, respectively, of the radioactivity. 
KMD  3213G  was  detected  in  dog  faeces  collected  at  24  h  and  between  24  and  48  h  post  dose 
(proportion was less than 6% in both samples). KMD 3293 was detected in dog plasma and urine at a 
ratio of 0.5% or less, and was the main metabolite in faeces. 
Studies revealed that there is a difference in metabolism of silodosin between the animals and humans; 
that  particularly  applies  to  the  glucuronide  conjugate  of  silodosin  (KMD  3213G)  not  detectable  in 
either rat or dog plasma. The applicant was asked to clarify why rat and dog were chosen as relevant 
species for repeat-dose toxicity studies. In their response the applicant emphasised that in vivo studies 
indicated  formation  of  KMD  3213G  (the  main  human  metabolite)  also  in  the  studied  species. 
Moreover,  the  pharmacological  profile  of  silodosin  had  been  already  appropriately  evaluated  in  rats 
and dogs: as a consequence these species were selected for toxicity studies. The applicant’s response 
has been acknowledged by the CHMP. 
Enzyme induction and inhibition 
Drug  metabolising  enzyme  activities  were  measured  using  liver  microsomes  from  male  Sprague 
Dawley rats (fasting) following once-daily repeat oral dose of 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day silodosin for 7 
days. Silodosin was found to increase cytochrome P-450 levels at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day and decrease 
activity of aniline 4-hydroxylase and UDP-GT (at 10 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively). No significant 
differences  were  observed  in  levels  of  microsome  protein,  cytochrome  b5,  aminopyrine  N-
demethylase  activity,  7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase  activity,  and  glutathione  S-transferase  activity 
compared  to  the  control.  The  silodosin  potential  to  inhibit  and/or  induce  CYP  P450  as  well  as 
interactions with the drugs that are likely to be used in combination and may affect the metabolism via 
CYP3A4  were  studied  with  the  use  of  human  biomaterials  (see  clinical  part  of  the  report  for  more 
detail). 
Excretion 
After  a  single  oral  dose  of  1  mg/kg  of  radiolabelled  silodosin  in  male  rats  under  fasting  and  non-
fasting  conditions,  the  remaining  radioactivity  levels  in  excreted  urine  and  faeces,  expired  air  and 
carcass  up  to  168  h  after  administration  were  measured.  More  than  95%  of  the  administered 
radioactivity was excreted in urine, faeces and expiration in 168 h after administration under fasting 
conditions.  Corresponding  fractions  of  administered  radioactivity  were  15.3%,  81.7%  and  0.5%, 
respectively indicating that the main route of elimination in rats was in the faeces. A single-dose study 
and repeat-dose 21-day study under non-fasting conditions in rats, and a single-dose (0.5 mg/kg) study 
under fasting conditions in dogs yielded similar results. 
Additionally, results from mass balance study in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions indicated 
that the fraction of radioactivity excreted in faeces after a single oral dose was also higher compared to 
urine. 
Results from studies with radiolabelled silodosin suggest enterohepatic circulation of the drug. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The  applicant  provided  no  non-clinical  data  of  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions.  However  clinical 
drug  interactions  studies  have  been  conducted.  As  there  is  adequate  clinical  data  regarding  drug 
interactions, the absence of non-clinical data can be accepted.

•  Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity of silodosin was assessed after oral administration of 400, 800, and 1600 mg/kg, 
and  intravenous  administration  of  60,  75  and  90  mg/kg  to  male  and  female  Sprague-Dawley  rats 
(5/sex/group). Noteworthy findings after oral administration included: lachrymation, ptosis, salivation, 
deep  respiration,  crouching  posture,  decreased  locomotor  activity,  mucoid  faeces  and  stained  fur, 
trembling and coldness to the touch, prone position and no faeces, decreased body weight in males and 
decreases  in  body  weight  gain  in  females.  In  decedent  animals,  clonic  convulsion,  dyspnoea  and 
gasping,  shallow  respiration  and  bradypnea  were  observed.  White  lesions  in  the  liver,  vacuolar 
degeneration in the portal area and focal necrosis of the liver were also noted in decedent animals. No 
abnormal  changes  were  observed  in  animals  that  survived  through  the  observation  period.  Similar 
overt signs of toxicity were noted after IV administration, there were however no necropsy findings.  
In male beagle dogs (2/group) after single oral doses of 1000 and 1500 mg/kg overt signs of toxicity 
consisted of redness of auricular, ptosis, conjunctival congestion, relaxation of nictitating membrane, 
faecal abnormality and vomiting, decreased rectal temperature and decreased heart rate, relaxation of 
the anus and muscle weakness, decrease in body weight. Decreased red erythrocyte, haemoglobin and 
haematocrit, decreased albumin and sodium and increased total cholesterol and triglyceride were noted 
in the surviving animal at 1500 mg/kg. These changes returned to normal by the end of observation 
period. Erosion, ulcer and haemorrhage lesions were noted in the stomach and gastrointestinal mucosa 
in the animals that died and histopathological examinations showed erosion of the stomach and small 
intestinal mucosa. At single intravenous doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg, overt signs of toxicity consisted of 
staggering gait, decreases in locomotor activity and foamy vomit at both doses, while the inability to 
stand/walk was seen, trembling, lateral position, general muscle weakness, muscle weakness of hind 
limbs,  deep  respiration,  conjunctival  congestion,  redness  of  auricular,  relaxation  of  the  nictitating 
membrane, lacrimation, salivation, vomiting-like behaviour, diarrhoea, loose stools and mucoid faeces 
were observed at 50 mg/kg. 
The oral LD50 value was estimated to be 878 mg/kg in both male and female rats. The approximate 
lethal doses after a single-dose intravenous administration of silodosin were 75 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg, 
Page 14 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively in males and females. In male dogs the approximate lethal dose was 1500 mg/kg orally 
and 50 mg/kg intravenously. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeat  dose  toxicity  was  assessed  in  several  studies  of  varying  duration  (2  weeks  –  52  weeks)  in 
which a wide range of oral doses have been administered (1-600 mg/kg/day) to rats and dogs.  
Rats 
Noteworthy  findings  in  rats  seen  across  all  studies  irrespective  of  the  dose  administered  included 
lachrymation, ptosis and salivation in both sexes. Decreased body weight and food consumption were 
generally  observed  in  male  rats  while  at  higher  doses  (>300-400  mg/kg)  increases  in  food 
consumption and body weight were noted in females.  
In  3-month  and  26-week  studies  loose  stools  and  diarrhoea  were  observed  at  higher  doses  (>300 
mg/kg/day) in both sexes. In the 26-week study occasionally decreased locomotor activity and prone 
positions were noted in both sexes at 300 mg/kg/day. Paraphimosis and deep respiration was noted in 
all males at >60 mg/kg/day. Deep respiration was also observed at all doses in females.   
In  one-month  study  increases  in  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALT) and decreases in triglycerides were noted in males at 600 mg/kg/day. Similarly, decreases in 
triglycerides  and  free  fatty  acids,  together  with  increases  in  blood  glucose,  albumin  and  inorganic 
phosphorus  were  noted  in  3-month  and  26-week  studies.  Decreased  daily  excretion  of  sodium  was 
noted  in  males  at  600  mg/kg/day  in  the  one-month  study,  while  an  increase  in  urinary  volume  was 
observed in males at 300 mg/kg/day in the 26-week study. 
Macroscopically,  changes  in  the  liver  appearance  including  a  clear  lobular  pattern,  yellow/pale 
colouring,  white  granular  changes  as  well  as  enlargement  of  the  liver  were  noted  predominantly  in 
males  (>5  mg/kg/day),  while increased liver  weight was  seen in  both sexes  across  all  studies (>200 
mg/kg/day).  In  the  one-month  study  mild  enlargement  of  the  thyroid  in  females  at  >200  mg/kg/day 
and  males  at  600  mg/kg/day,  increased  thyroid  weight  in  both  sexes  at  600  mg/kg/day  and  minor 
haemorrhage  lesions  in the  stomach  in  both  sexes  at  600  mg/kg/day  were  observed.  In  the  3-month 
study increased adrenal weights were noted in males at >100 mg/kg/day and females at 400 mg/kg/day 
and  decreased thymus  weight  were  noted  in  both  sexes  at 400  mg/kg/day.  Increased  adrenal  weight 
was  seen  in  males  at  60  mg/kg/day  also  in  the  26-week  study,  while  increased  ovary  weight  and 
decreased uterus weight was noted in females at 300 mg/kg/day. 
Histopathological findings seen across the studies included fatty degeneration of hepatocytes in both 
sexes, eosinophilic degeneration of centrilobular hepatocytes predominantly in males, and enlargement 
of hepatocytes in both sexes (>1 mg/kg/day). In males hyperplasia of the connective tissue and focal 
fibrosis  were  also  observed  (>300  mg/kg/day).  Electron  microscopy  showed  moderate  to  severe 
increases  of  lipid  droplets  in  hepatocytes  in  males  and  hyperplasia  of  smooth-surfaced  endoplasmic 
reticulum  in  both  sexes  (>100  mg/kg/day).  An  increase  in  hepatic  cytochrome  P-450  enzymes  was 
also noted in males in the one-month study and in both sexes in the 26-week study. In the 3-month and 
26-week  study  moderate  microgranuloma  was  seen  in  the  liver.  Hypertrophy  of  vaginal  mucosal 
epithelial  cells,  hyperplasia  of  the  mammary  gland  and  increased  lactation  activity,  together  with 
atrophy of the uterus were noted in females (>60 mg/kg/day). Atrophy of the gastric fundic gland and 
oedema  of  the  submucosal  layer  of  the  glandular stomach  was  seen  in  both  sexes  in the  one-month 
study. In the 26-week study extended adrenocortical regions were seen in males. 
In  the  one-month  study  during  the  recovery  period  reversal  of  the  mild  fatty  degeneration  of 
hepatocytes was not seen in males previously treated at 600 mg/kg/day. Recovery was shown for all 
other findings.  
In general, a dose proportional increase in AUC and Cmax was seen. The NOAEL was considered to 
be 20 mg/kg/day in the one-month study, 25 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females in the 
Page 15 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-month study, less than 15 mg/kg/day in males and 60 mg/kg/day in females in 26-week study and 5 
mg/kg/day in 26-week study with low doses of silodosin. 
In the 2-week intravenous study in rats silodosin was given at 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day. Six males and 
4 females at 50 mg/kg/day died during the study (immediately after dosing). In these animals, overt 
signs  of  toxicity  consisted  of  clonic  convulsions  and  gasping  (just  after  drug  administration).  In 
surviving  animals  (both  sexes)  ptosis  starting  just  after  administration  was  noted  at  all  doses,  deep 
respiration at >10 mg/kg/day and prone position and decreased locomotor activity were observed at 50 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day since death occurred at 50 mg/kg/day. 
No histopathology was conducted.  
Dogs 
In dogs (both sexes) overt toxicity findings seen across the studies consisted of relaxation of nictitating 
membranes, conjunctival congestion, ptosis, trembling and liquid stools, ataxic gait or abnormal gait, 
vomiting and salivation, lateral position was occasionally observed (>10 mg/kg/day). Decreased body 
weights  were  also  observed.  The  duration  and  severity  of  these  symptoms  usually  decreased 
throughout the duration of the studies. In the dog 1-month study with one month recovery, prolonged 
PR and QT intervals were noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG) at 400 mg/kg/day. In the same study 
decreases in heart rate and blood pressure were observed in both sexes. However these effects were 
not  noted  in  the  13-week  and  52-week  study.  Refer  to  the  discussion  on  the  non-clinical  aspects 
section for further detail.  
Changes  in  haematology  parameters  were  observed  in  the  one-month  and  52-week  study.  They 
included  increased  fibrinogen,  platelet  counts  and  neutrophils,  decreased  lymphocytes,  eosinophils, 
reticulocytes,  erythrocyte  counts,  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  (>80kg/mg/day).  Bone  marrow 
analysis showed increased immature neutrophils and an increased granulocyte/erythrocyte cell ratio, as 
well as a slight decrease in the percentage of polychromatic erythroblasts in males at 400 mg/kg/day. 
Increased total cholesterol and α-globulin ratios were noted in both sexes at >100 mg/kg/day in the 1-
month study while decreases in triglycerides, total cholesterol and albumins were seen in females in 
the 13-week study (>50 mg/kg/day). In the one-month study at 400 mg/kg/day increased urea nitrogen 
and  decreased  total  protein,  sodium,  potassium  and  chloride  were  noted  in  both  sexes.  Increased 
alkaline phosphatase in males and increased AST (GOT), ALT (GPT) and creatinine in females were 
also  noted  at  this  dose.  Decreased  creatine  phosphokinase  was  also  noted  in  males  at  100  and  400 
mg/kg/day and in females at 400 mg/kg/day. In the 52-week study decreased urea nitrogen was seen in 
both  sexes  and  increased  chloride  was  noted  in  females  at  this  dose.  Urinalyses  showed  decreased 
sodium  in  both sexes  at  80  mg/kg/day.  Faecal  occult  blood  tests  were  positive  in  both sexes  at  400 
mg/kg/day in the one-month study.  
Macroscopically,  changes  in  the  liver  appearance  including  clear  hepatic  lobular  pattern,  darkened 
colour, sinusoidal dilation and congestion of the liver were seen across the studies (>20 mg/kg/day). 
An increase in relative liver weights was noted (>80 mg/kg/day). Erosions, haemorrhage and ulcers of 
gastric  mucosa  were  observed  in  the  one-month  study  (>100  mg/kg/day).  Atrophy  of  the  thymus, 
enlargement of the adrenal cortex, fibrin adhesion and congestion of the gut, increases in adrenal and 
kidney weights and a decrease in thymus weights were noted across the studies (>50 mg/kg/day). A 
degeneration  of  seminiferous  tubular  epithelium  was  noted  in  males  at  all  doses  in  the  one-month 
study.  
Histopathologically, an enlargement of hepatocytes, atrophy of the thymus, erosions of gastric mucosa 
and delayed maturation of the genital organs were observed across the studies (>50 mg/kg/day). These 
findings were also observed in dead animals and those sacrificed for humane reasons. In the 52-week 
study  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  deposition  of  yellow  or  brown  lipofuscin-like  materials  in 
hepatocytes in both sexes was noted at all doses. Depositions of brown lipofuscin-like materials were 
observed  in  tubular  epithelial  cells  of  the  renal  cortex  in  males  at  all  doses  and  in  females  at  >20 
mg/kg/day. Refer to the discussion on the non-clinical aspects section for further detail.

In  the  one-month  study  findings  in  the  recovery  animals  included  decreased  prostate  weights  and 
degeneration of seminiferous tubular epithelium in males at >100 mg/kg/day, increased platelet counts 
in  females  at  100  mg/kg/day  and  males  at  400  mg/kg/day,  increased  fibrinogen  levels,  decreased 
thymus  and  testis  weights,  enlargement  of  hepatocytes,  and  atrophy  of  the  thymus  in  males  at  400 
mg/kg/day.  However,  there  were  no  noticeable  findings  in  animals  at  25  mg/kg/day,  indicating  a 
favourable recovery at this dose. 
In  general, a dose proportional increase in AUC and Cmax was seen with a plateau observed in the 
one-month study at >100 mg/kg/day. There were no major sex differences in the PK indices in other 
studies. The NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg/kg/day in the one-month study, 10 mg/kg/day in the 
13-week study and 20 mg/kg/day in 52-week study. In the one-month study one male and two females 
at  400  mg/kg/day  died,  and  one  male  and  one  female  were  killed  in  a  moribund  state  for  humane 
reasons. In the 13-week study one male at 200 mg/kg/day was killed (humane sacrifice). 
In  the  2-week  intravenous  study  1,  5,  25  mg/kg/day  were  given  to  male  and  female  Beagle  dogs 
(3/sex/group) for 2 weeks. Overt signs of toxicity were similar to those observed in oral studies and 
started  at  25  mg/kg/day.  Increased  heart  rates  were  noted  on  Day  7  in  males  at  >5  mg/kg/day. 
Decreased erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin and haematocrit were noted in females at 25 mg/kg/day 
and  decreased  triglycerides  were  noted  in  males  at  >5mg/kg/day  and  females  at  25  mg/kg/day. 
Increased  liver  weights  were  noted  in  females  at  all  doses  and  increased  pituitary  and  lung  weights 
were noted in females at >5 mg/kg/day. Dose proportional increases in the AUC0-24 and Cmax were 
noted. There was no sex difference. The NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg/kg/day. 
•  Toxicokinetic data 
In rats and dogs, there were occasional differences (which were sometimes marked) in exposure 
between males and females. There was no evidence of accumulation.

without metabolic activation. Concentrations of 156 – 5000 and 78 – 2500 µg/plate were used without 
and  with  metabolic  activation, respectively.  No  increase  over  2-fold  was  observed  in the  number  of 
revertant  colonies  compared  with  the  vehicle  control  with  or  without  metabolic  activation.  KMD 
3213G was not considered mutagenic under these test conditions.

Chinese hamster lung-cells (CHL/IU cells) were used in this study and concentrations of 1250, 2500 
and  5000  µg/ml  both  for  short-term  treatment  with  and  without  metabolic  activation  and  continued 
treatment  without  metabolic  activation  were  used  to  observe  chromosome  responses.  No  significant 
increases  were  noted  in  the  frequency  of  cells  with  structural  chromosome  aberrations  or  that  of 
polyploid  cells,  compared  the  control.  KMD  3213G  did  not  induce  chromosomal  aberrations  under 
these test conditions. 
In  conclusion,  there  was  a  slight increase  in  the  number  of  chromosomal  aberrations  in  mammalian 
cells in the  absence  of  metabolic activation.  Further  analysis  demonstrated  a  decrease in the  mitotic 
index indicative of cellular toxicity. Although an increase was noted in the Mouse lymphoma mutation 
assay (Test 2) it was not reproducible. This increase, therefore, was not considered to be significant in 
terms  of  the  evaluation  of genotoxicity.  Moreover, silodosin  and  its  glucuronide  conjugate  were  not 
mutagenic in other tests. Hence, the weight of evidence suggests that silodosin is not genotoxic. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
The  carcinogenicity  of silodosin  was  studied in  mice (50/sex/group)  and  rats  (60/sex/group) in  104-
week studies. The findings noted in females, although not directly relevant as silodosin is indicated in 
males only have been included in this report for completeness. The administered doses were 60, 150 
and  400  mg/kg/day  in  female  mice,  20,  60,  and  200/100  mg/kg/day  in  male  mice,  15,  80  and  250 
mg/kg/day  in  female  rats  and  15,  50  and  150  mg/kg/day  in  male  rats.  All  studies  were  by  dietary 
administration and the doses stated are estimated target doses. 
In female mice, neoplastic lesions included mammary adenocarcinomas, and adenoacanthoma in mice 
treated  at  150  mg/kg/day  and  higher;  and  non-statistically  significant  increases  in  pituitary  and 
hepatocellular  adenomas  in  animals  treated  at  400  mg/kg/day.  Non-neoplastic  findings  included 
uterine adenomyoma at all doses, mammary atypical hyperplasia, lobular hyperplasia, squamous cell 
metaplasia,  increased  cystic  uterine  glands,  and  decreased  cystic  endometrial  hyperplasia  at  ≥150 
mg/kg/day,  diffuse  or  focal  hyperplasia  and  focal  hypertrophy  of  the  anterior  lobe  of  the  pituitary, 
dilation of the mammary acinus and duct, and increased dilation of the uterine gland at 400 mg/kg/day. 
These  findings  appeared  to  be  related  to  increased  prolactin  production.  Prolactin  levels  were 
increased either at one dose or multiple doses over 14-24 days. Increased liver and pituitary weights 
and  decreased  uterus  and  cervix  weights  were  observed  at ≥150  mg/kg/day.  AUC0-24  and  Cmax  at 
week 26 showed greater than dose proportional increases at ≥150 mg/kg/day. 
In  male  mice  no  increase  in  neoplastic  lesions  or  tumour  development  were  noted.  Non-neoplastic 
lesions  included  dilated  seminal  vesicles  and  coagulating  glands  as  well  as  increased  interstitial 
infiltration of lymphocytes at all doses. Decreased heart weights were noted at all doses and increased 
epididymis  weights  were  noted  at  ≥60  mg/kg/day,  along  with  decreased  prostate  weights  at  100 
mg/kg/day.  AUC0-24  and  Cmax  values  at  week  26  increased  more  than  dose  proportionally  at  ≥60 
mg/kg/day.  
In  male  rats,  neoplastic  lesions  included  statistically  significant  increases  in  thyroid  follicular  cell 
adenomas  as  well  as  combined  thyroid  follicular  cell  adenomas  and  carcinomas  in  males  at  150 
mg/kg/day. Non-neoplastic lesions included increased hypertrophy of thyroid follicular cells in males 
at all doses and in females at 250 mg/kg/day.  Increased cystic hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells 
was  also  noted  in  males  at  150  mg/kg/day.  Based  on  the  results  from  mechanistic  studies  these 
tumours  were thought  to  be  related  to increased  UDP-GT  levels  and  disturbances  of the T3  and  T4 
metabolism.  Toxicology  findings  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  single-  and  repeat-dose  studies. 
AUC  and  Cmax  values  at  week  26  increased  dose-proportionally  with  the  exception  of  the  highest 
dose of 250 mg/kg/day in females. Refer to the discussion on the non-clinical aspects for further detail. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
In  the  study  assessing  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  doses  of  20,  60,  200  and  600 
mg/kg/day were administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before mating (64 days) and through the 
mating  period  until  the  day  before  necropsy  and  to  females  for  15  days  before  mating,  through  the 
Page 20 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mating period and up to Day 7 of gestation. Decreased fertility rate was noted in males at all doses, 
and a decreased mating rate was observed in males at ≥200 mg/kg/day. In females, findings included a 
decreased  fertility  rate  at  all  doses,  prolonged  or  disappeared  oestrous  cycle  at  ≥60  mg/kg/day, 
decreased mating rate at ≥200 mg/kg/day and decreased implantation index at 20 and 600 mg/kg/day. 
Decreases in foetal body weight were also noted at 600 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related changes in 
the number of corpora lutea, sex ratio and foetal anomalies were noted. In order to determine whether 
a decrease in fertility and early embryo development were caused by males or females two studies in 
which treated males were paired with untreated females were performed. In the first one (Mating I) the 
highest dose of 600 mg/kg/day was chosen while in the second one (Mating II) the highest dose of 20 
mg/kg/day was selected. A third study in which females treated with the highest dose of 20 mg/kg/day 
were  paired  with  untreated  males  was  also  conducted.  Noteworthy  findings  in  the  first  two  studies 
included decreased sperm counts and decreased viable sperm numbers at 600 mg/kg/day, decrease in 
the  fertility  rate  at  20,  60  and  600  mg/kg/day,  aspermatogenesis  at  ≥200  mg/kg/day,  decreased 
implantation  index  at  all  doses.  In  males  treated  with  lower  doses  (Mating  II)  recoverability  was 
confirmed.  In  the  third  study  (study  in  female  rats)  there  were  no  test  article-related  effects  on 
caesarean section examinations. The NOAEL for general toxicity and reproductive functions of male 
animals and early embryo development was considered to be 6 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for general 
toxicity  of  female  animals  was  considered  to  be  6  mg/kg/day,  while  the  NOAEL  for  reproductive 
function  of  females  and  early  embryo  development  was  considered  to  be  20  mg/kg/day.  This 
information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Silodosin was not teratogenic in rats given up to 1000 mg/kg/day from Day 7 to Day 17 of gestation. 
The  NOAEL  for  general  toxicity  of  dams  was  estimated  to  be  less  than  30  mg/kg/day,  while  the 
NOAEL for reproductive function in dams and embryo-foetal development was estimated to be 1000 
mg/kg/day. Teratogenicity was not observed in rabbits at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (Day 6 to Day 18 
of gestation). 4 cases of abortion in the late stages of gestation along with emaciation, decreased body 
weight  and food  consumption  were  observed at  200 mg/kg/day.  These finding were not  seen at  any 
other dose. Decreased foetal weight and placental weight, and increased post-implantation loss were 
attributed  to  decreased  food  consumption  in  dams  at  200  mg/kg/day.  The  NOAEL  for  dams  and 
embryo-fetal development was considered to be 60 mg/kg/day. 
In  the  study  assessing  prenatal  and  postnatal  development,  including  maternal  function  daily  oral 
doses of silodosin were given to female SD rats from Day 7 of gestation to Day 20 after delivery. A 
high  dose  of  300  mg/kg/day  was  selected  for  this  study  (other  doses  selected  were  10,  30  and  100 
mg/kg/day).  No  test  article-related  effects  were  observed  on  maternal  body  weight.  No  test  article-
related  effects  were  noted  in  nursing  by  dams,  post-natal  growth,  development  and  reproductive 
functions of offspring, and development in the next generation (F2). The NOAEL was considered to 
be 10 mg/kg/day for general toxicity of dams (F0), 30 mg/kg/day for maternal function in dams, and 
300 mg/kg/day for the offspring (F1). 
•  Local tolerance  
Intravenous,  perivenous  and  intra-arterial  tolerance  studies  using  silodosin  for injection  (0.2  mg/ml) 
were carried out to support a clinical pharmacology study (BA / influence of food intake). Silodosin 
for injection showed a very minor haemolytic effect (0.4 – 0.6%) and muscle damage. Nevertheless, 
no specific concerns derive from the local tolerance studies. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
The  applicant  has  conducted  several  additional  toxicity  studies  including  phototoxicity  studies, 
antigenicity studies, immunotoxicity studies, studies on impurities and numerous mechanistic studies. 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  phototoxicity  studies  suggest  that  silodosin  may  have  the  ability  to  minimally 
increase  sensitivity  to  sunlight.  From  the  data  presented  the  effects  seen  were  mild  in  nature  and 
seemed to be a high dose phenomenon. This information is adequately reflected in the RMP. 
Silodosin was considered not to have antigenic potential in guinea pigs.

The evaluation of potential adverse effects of silodosin on the immune system was incorporated in the 
repeat-dose toxicity tests. Effect of repeat-dose treatment with silodosin on the immune system such as 
the morphology of thymus and lymph nodes were assessed. The observed changes were generally not 
dose limiting (apart from mortality and body weight) and can be attributed to the study-related stress. 
Metabolites 
Toxicity of glucuronide conjugate of silodosin was assessed in a single-dose (10 and 50 mg/kg) and 2-
week (2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day) intravenous dose study in rats. The lethal dose of KMD 3213G in the 
single-dose study was considered to be 50 mg for both sexes with no practical difference in the lethal 
dose compared to silodosin. 
In the 2-week intravenous study in rats the toxicology findings were similar to those observed in the 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  Toxicokinetic  examinations  showed  a  higher  exposure  to  KMD  3213G 
compared with silodosin. The Cmax and AUC of KMD 3213G given at 50 mg/kg/day were 530-and 
10-fold higher than the respective indices in humans given at the recommended clinical dose. Under 
this  condition,  the  toxicity  of  KMD  3213G  was  considered  to  be  qualitatively  and  quantitatively 
similar  to,  or  less  severe  than  that  of  silodosin.  It  should  however  be  noticed  that  the  CHMP  has 
expressed concern whether 2-week study has been of sufficient duration to evaluate the toxicity of the 
glucuronide  metabolite.  Responses  provided  by  the  applicant  underlined  that  the  toxicity  observed 
with  KMD  3213G  was  similar  to  that  of  silodosin  in  the  circumstances  where  sufficient  systemic 
exposure exceeding that achieved in human has been reached after the iv administration of the drug.  
Furthermore, a 4-week oral dose study in dogs (25 mg/kg/day) was performed in order to assess the 
accumulation  of  metabolites  KMD  3241 and  3289 in the liver and  kidney.  As the  concentrations  of 
metabolites were considered to reach the steady state on Day 21 it was concluded that no accumulation 
in the liver and kidney was observed. 
Metabolites  KMD  3241  and  KMD  3289,  were  identified  as  a  degradation  products  and  were 
commonly seen in stability test results. Exposure to KMD 3241 as a metabolite was confirmed after 
single  and  repeat  oral  toxicity  studies  in  the  rodents  and  dogs,  therefore  this  metabolite  has  been 
adequately evaluated. In addition genotoxicity micronucleus test with mice and an UDS test with rat 
hepatocytes have been conducted with KMD 3241 and KMD 3289. Sufficient toxicity data has been 
provided to support qualification of these degradation products/metabolites. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  has  submitted 
the  Fpen  value  of  0.181  %  based  on  recently  published 
pharmacoepidemiological data taking into account the whole male population from >45 years in the 
entire EU 25 (Eurostat). The revised estimate of Fpen based on published pharmacoepidemiological 
data has been rounded up to 0.2%, which is associated with a PECsurfacewater of 0.008 µg/L. It was 
concluded  that  the  updated  ERA  provides  clarification  that  the  PECsurface  water  for  silodosin  was 
less  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L,  and  therefore  a  phase  II  assessment  was  not  required. 
Consequently, it was considered that the use of silodosin for the treatment of BPH is unlikely to pose a 
risk to the environment.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  of  silodosin  have  been  studied 
extensively. The product shows high affinity for alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (subtype A) in the lower 
urinary tract causing relaxation of the prostate capsule, urethra and trigone of the urinary bladder. This 
action supports the indication of silodosin in the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia.  The  affinity  of  silodosin  for  other  alpha-receptors  (subtypes  B  and  D)  has  been 
demonstrated  to  be  50-160-fold  lower  indirectly  indicating  a  lower  risk  of  alpha-receptor-  mediated 
adverse events, e.g. orthostatic hypotension. Silodosin showed no effect on the central nervous system 
of  rats  at  doses  up  to  2  mg/kg.  At  20  mg/kg  trembling,  decreased  awakening  levels  and  body 
temperature were observed.  
Page 22 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  vitro  silodosin  inhibited  hERG  tail  current  and  prolonged  the  APD90  in  the  papillary  muscle 
isolated  from  guinea  pigs.  Furthermore,  it  decreased  blood  pressure  at  0.2  mg/kg  in  the  safety 
pharmacology study and prolonged PR and QT intervals at 400 mg/kg/day in the 1-month toxicology 
study in dogs. Therefore, the CHMP requested the applicant to discuss these findings. The responses 
underlined that no effects on the heart rate and ECG and blood pressure were observed at doses up to 
20 mg/kg in the 52-week study corresponding to AUC safety margin of 20-fold and 12-fold in males 
and females, respectively. Similarly, no abnormality in the ECG was noted in the 13-week study. The 
CHMP has therefore acknowledged that silodosin is unlikely to cause a significant decrease in blood 
pressure and has little effect on the repolarisation process of the heart. 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  revealed  a  difference  in  metabolism  of  silodosin  between  animals  and 
humans.  This  particularly  applied  to  the  glucuronide  conjugate  of  silodosin,  the  main  metabolite  in 
human plasma. It has been concluded that due to the fact that the pharmacological profile of silodosin 
and  its  metabolites  had  been  already  thoroughly  evaluated  in  rats  and  dogs  those  species  would  be 
appropriate for the toxicology studies. 
In the single-dose toxicity studies the oral LD50 value was estimated to be 878 mg/kg in both male 
and female rats. The approximate lethal doses for male and female rats receiving a single iv dose were 
75  mg/kg  and  90  mg/kg,  respectively.  The  findings  observed  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies 
were  related  to  enzymatic  induction  in  the  dog  liver  (fatty  degeneration),  increased  prolactin 
production (changes in mammary gland and sex organs in female rats), stress (atrophy of the thymus 
and lipid accumulation) or were considered a high dose phenomenon (atrophy of the fundic gland and 
oedema  of  stomach  submucosa  in  rats  and  dogs).  In  dogs  degeneration  of  the  seminiferous  tubular 
epithelium  and  delayed  maturation  of  male  genital  organs  were  observed.  These  findings  were  not 
considered to be significant in terms of human safety since no changes in male reproductive organs 
were observed in the 52-week oral dose study and there was a sufficiently wide safety margin between 
the NOAEL in dogs and the recommended human clinical dose. 
In the 52-week oral dose study in dogs the deposition of lipofuscin-like  materials, in hepatocytes in 
both sexes was noted at all doses with no histopathological correlates or blood biochemical changes. 
No clear signal of liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials; however impaired hepatic function and 
jaundice  have  been  reported  from  post-marketing  use  of  silodosin  in  Japan.  Therefore  the  CHMP 
requested  that  the  applicant  provide  a  more  robust  scientific  discussion  of  these  findings  and  their 
relevance  to  man.  Following  the  applicant’s  response  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  findings  were  not 
considered of toxicological significance and relevant to man as 1) the severity was minimal or slight, 
2)  this  finding  was  observed  in  dogs  only,  and  3)  no  other  histopathological  findings  and  blood 
biochemical changes suggestive of hepatotoxicity were observed. 
Silodosin was considered not to be genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. 
Neoplastic lesions observed in female mice, including mammary adenocarcinomas, adenoacanthoma, 
pituitary  adenomas  appeared  to  be  related  to  the  increased  prolactin  production  as  discussed  by  the 
applicant  in  responses  to  the  CHMP  questions.  In  male  rats,  an  increase  in  incidence  of  thyroid 
follicular  cell  tumours  was  noted.  The  discussion  provided  by  the  applicant  indicated  that  these 
tumours  were  related  to  increased  UDP-GT  levels  and  disturbances  of  the  T3  and  T4  metabolism, 
common findings specific to rodents. 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or rabbits. Slight, but reversible, decreases in sperm 
counts and mobility were noted in male rats. In female rats, silodosin was associated with alterations 
in  the  oestrus  cycle  at  high  doses, but  not  with infertility.  Decreased fertility  and  implantation  rates 
were also noted at >20 mg/kg/day in a study in which only males were treated with silodosin after a 2-
week  drug-free  period.  In  dogs,  delayed  maturation  of  genital  organs  (13  week  study)  was  noted  at 
50mg/kg/day and decreased spermatogenesis was observed at doses approximately 5 times higher than 
the  maximum  recommended  human  dose  at  13  weeks.  This  finding  was  not  seen  in  52-week  dog 
study.

In  vitro  and  in  vivo  phototoxicity  studies  suggest  that  silodosin  may  have  the  ability  to  increase 
sensitivity to sunlight. 
Muscular damage of silodosin for injection was more severe than physiological saline but less severe 
than damage from 0.425% and 1.7% acetic acid solution (positive control). 
All toxicology findings have been adequately reflected in the SmPC and risk management programme 
for silodosin. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Silodosin  has  been  developed  for  the  treatment  of  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  (BPH).  It  is  an  α1-
adrenoreceptor  antagonist  that  selectively  affects  the  prostate,  the  urethra,  and  the  trigone  of  the 
urinary  bladder  relaxing  smooth  muscles  in  the  lower  urinary  tract.  Silodosin  is  intended  to  be 
administered to adult males at a dose of 8 mg daily. The 4 mg strength has also been developed for 
special populations (patients with moderate renal impairment).  
The clinical development programme consisted of 36 studies. 
The efficacy and safety of silodosin has been assessed in four controlled clinical studies: one Phase II 
study conducted in the United Stated (US), and three Phase III studies, two of which were conducted 
in the US and one in Europe. Additionally, the long-term efficacy of silodosin was evaluated in two 
open-label  (OL)  safety  extension  studies,  one  OL  study  conducted  in  the  US  (extension  of  studies 
SI04009 and SI04010) and one conducted in Europe (extension of study IT-CL 0215), as summarised 
in the table below.

Pharmacokinetics 
Thirteen  clinical  pharmacology  studies  provided  general  pharmacokinetic  information.  Five  studies 
investigated intrinsic factors affecting pharmacokinetics (including age, renal and liver dysfunction), 
five  studies  focused  on  pharmacokinetic  interactions,  one  study  was  a  QTc  investigation,  and  one 
study  investigated  a  pharmacodynamic  drug-drug  interaction.  Four  phase  II/III  studies  provided 
pharmacokinetic  information  from  595  patients  (85  from  KMD-201,  9  from  US021-99,  243  from 
SI04009 and 258 from KMD-305). 
Several analytical methods were used during the various stages of development of the product. All of 
them  have  been  sufficiently  validated  for  selectivity  (blank  check  and  matrix  effect),  linearity, 
precision, accuracy, reproducibility, recovery and stability parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a non-compartmental analysis. In the food effect study 
(KDM-308),  fasting/non-fasting  ratio  of  Cmax  and  AUC  and  corresponding  90%CI  were  calculated 
using the standard methodology. The mixed model using log-transformed values of Cmax and AUC0-
48 as the response variable, the presence or absence of food and period as fixed effect, and subject as 
random effect was applied. 
•  Absorption  
- Bioavailability 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  silodosin  was  investigated  in  an  open-label  cross-over  study  after  a 
single dose of 4 mg compared to a single 2 mg intravenous administration over 4 h (KMD-308). The 
study also assessed the food effect after single oral doses of 4 mg.   
Pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged silodosin were as follows:  
PK indices (mean ± SD) 
Cmax:  
AUCinf:  
tmax:  
t1/2:  
Single oral administration  
4 mg (fasting state) 
27.986±9.555 ng/mL, 
133.7±58 ng/h/mL, 
1.36±1.12 h 
4.714±3.710 h 
Single IV administration  
2 mg (fasting state) 
42.907±7.902 ng/mL 
206.9±41 ng/h/mL 
4.00±0.00 h 
3.614±1.718 h 
The extent (mean ± SD) of bioavailability (F) was calculated as 32.2±11.4%.  
An  in  vitro  study  using  Caco-2  cells  overexpressing  P-gp  was  also  performed  to  determine  the 
involvement  of  P-gp  in  the  membrane  transport  of  silodosin.  The  membrane  transport  coefficient 
(Papp) of 14C-silodosin for B (basolateral) to A (apical) transport was 10.4 times higher than that for 
A to B, suggesting an involvement of an efflux transporter preferred direction in cellular membrane 
transport. Basal to apical transport was inhibited by verapamil, a well known inhibitor of P-gp. This 
information is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
- Bioequivalence 
During the course of drug development clinical supplies of silodosin capsules have been produced by 
three  distinct  methods  of  manufacture.  The  first  generation  capsules  were  used  in  the  early  clinical 
studies (manufacturing method A). The second and third generation capsules (methods B and C) were 
used  in  phase  II  and  phase  III  clinical  studies.  An  active  and  placebo  controlled  phase  III  efficacy 
study  (IT-CL-0215)  was  conducted  with  the  final  marketing  product  8  mg  capsule.  Dose  finding 
(US021-99) and the two placebo controlled studies (SI04009, SI04010) were conducted with a 4 mg 
final marketing formulation.  
In vivo investigation of the bioequivalence of the 8 mg capsules and 4 mg capsules utilised in pivotal 
clinical  trials  was  not  performed.  According  to  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence”  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98,  silodosin  capsules  are  considered 
highly water soluble, since the amount contained in the highest strength (8 mg) is dissolved in 250 mL 
Page 25 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of each of three buffers at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 at 37°C, and >85% dissolves within 15 min. Therefore, 
a biowaiver to conduct a bioequivalence study with the 8 mg and 4 mg capsules is acceptable from the 
clinical point of view.  
- Influence of food 
In three studies (Studies 95283, UK01-97, KMD-308) the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 
silodosin  was  investigated.  Food  decreased  Cmax  by  approximately  30%,  delayed  tmax  by 
approximately  1  h,  and  had  a  negligible  effect  on  the  AUC.  Silodosin  is  recommended  to  be  taken 
with  food  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  of  orthostatic  hypotension.  This  information  is  adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Distribution 
In  healthy  adult  males  the  volume  of  distribution  was  0.8  L/kg  (49.5  L)  after  a  single  intravenous 
administration of a 2 mg of silodosin over a 4 h infusion (Study KMD-308). 
Plasma protein binding 
Plasma  protein  binding  was  evaluated  in  three  studies  (PK10153,  DMPK2003-0053,  DMPK2004-
0033).  The  binding  rate  against  human  plasma  protein  was  almost  constant  regardless  of  the 
concentration  of  14C-silodosin  added,  and  was  between  94.6%  and  95.8%.  The  binding  to  α1-acid 
glycoprotein was predominant (94.3 to 96.0%). The binding rate of the metabolites KMD 3213G and 
KMD  3293  against  human  plasma  protein  was  91.2%  to  92.0%  and  90.2%  to  91.9%,  respectively. 
Similarly to silodosin, binding to α1-acid glycoprotein appeared to be predominant for KMD 3213G 
and  KMD  3293.  Silodosin  did  not  distribute  to  blood  cells  in  the  study  assessing  plasma-blood 
partition (PK10091). 
•  Elimination 
Excretion  
Results from a mass balance study (US012-99) in which 6 healthy male volunteers received a single 
dose  of  8  mg  of  silodosin  showed  that  the  product  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  tmax  of  2.17  h.  The 
AUC0-t  of  silodosin  represented  less  than  10%  of  the  total  plasma  radioactivity.  The  plasma 
concentration decreased with t½ of 12 h while the elimination half life of radioactivity in plasma was 
125 h suggesting that silodosin undergoes extensive first pass and systemic metabolism and some of 
the metabolites have very  long elimination half life. Radioactivities were excreted mainly in faeces; 
55% of the dose was excreted in faeces by 144 h post-dose. Cumulative urinary excretion was 34% of 
total dose by 48 hours post-dose. In faeces, unchanged silodosin accounted for 28% and 15% of total 
faecal  radioactivity  and  of  total  dose  radioactivity,  respectively.  The  urinary  recovery  of  unchanged 
silodosin  was  less  than  3%  of  the  dose.  A  metabolite  profiling  was  performed  and  two  of  the 
metabolites,  KMD  3213G  and  KMD  3293,  were  determined  as  major  contributors  for  the  total 
circulating radioactivity. 
Similarly,  other  single-dose  oral  administration  studies  (95283  and  98363)  and  the  7-day  repeated-
dose oral administration studies (95284 and 98364) showed that the urinary cumulative excretion rate 
of unchanged silodosin was less than 5%. 
In study KMD-308 after intravenous administration of a 2 mg of silodosin over a 4 h infusion, the total 
body clearance was determined to be 2.8 mL/min/kg. In the same study, after oral administration of 4 
mg silodosin the calculated total clearance was 9.5 mL/min/kg and 10.2 mL/min/kg under fasting and 
fed conditions, respectively. The clearance values were recalculated as L/h/kg in response to CHMP 
request.  They  ranged  from  0.164  L/h/kg  after  the  iv  administration  to  0.998  L/h/kg  after  the  oral 
administration. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
A  series  of  in  vitro  studies  were  performed  in  order  to  detect  the  metabolic  pathway  of  silodosin 
(studies  PK10104,  PK-03-519,  AE-3348,  PK10126, KMD-OIR  001,  DMPK  2003-0037).  The  major 
Page 26 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metabolites  observed  after  incubation  with  human  hepatic  cells  was  KMD  3213G  and  KMD  3293. 
While generation of KMD 3293 was also observed in rat, dog and monkey hepatic cells, KMD-3213G 
was  generated  in  only  an  extremely  small  amount  in  the  species  other  than  humans.  In  addition  to 
these  metabolites,  KMD  3295,  KMD  3310  and  KMD  3289  were  observed  in  human  hepatic  cells, 
though  their  percentages  of  generation  were  very  small.  The  generation  of  KMD  3213G  was  noted 
with  UGT2B7,  while  both  alcohol  dehydrogenase  and  aldehyde  dehydrogenase  were  assumed  to  be 
involved in generation of KMD 3293. Results revealed also that CYP3A4 played a predominant role 
(70%)  in  the  oxidation  and  metabolism  of  silodosin  in  human  hepatic  microsomes.  CYP2D6  (20%) 
and  CYP1A2  (20%)  also  contributed  to  the  metabolism  of  silodosin  as  shown  by  the  decrease  of 
metabolites  after  co-incubation  with  an  enzyme-specific  inhibitor.  The  CHMP  has  requested  the 
applicant to discuss possible metabolic interactions and subsequent potential for drug-drug interactions 
of  silodosin.  In  their  response,  the  applicant  has  presented  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  metabolic 
pathways  of  silodosin.  Moreover,  a  warning  regarding  the  co-administration  of  silodosin  with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors was added to the SmPC.  
In vivo 
In  a  mass  balance  study  (US012-99),  the  major  metabolites  were  KMD  3213G  and  KMD  3293  in 
plasma, KMD 3293, KMD 3310 and KMD 3213G in urine, and KMD 3293, KMD 3241, KMD 3295 
and KMD 3289 in faeces. 
Inter-conversion 
• 
Silodosin  exhibits  chirality  and  the  drug  substance  is  the  R-enantiomer.  The  potential  for  silodosin 
inter-conversion was discussed. The submitted results confirmed that no inter-conversion occurred in 
the clinical setting.  
•  Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Less  than  5%  of  silodosin  is  excreted  unchanged  in  urine.  Silodosin  undergoes  extensive  first  pass 
metabolism  (absolute  bioavailability  30%)  and  is  metabolised  extensively.  Main  metabolites  are 
silodosin glucuronide (KMD 3213G) and KMD 3293. The exposure of KMD 3213G is 4-times higher 
than the exposure to unchanged silodosin. KMD 3213G is eliminated in urine with half-life of 15 to 20 
h. KMD 3293 is also eliminated renally with half-life of 10 to 15 h. No accumulation of silodosin or 
KMD 3293 occurred after multiple dose administration, whereas the KMD 3213G exposure increased 
more  than  2  fold  after  repeated  administration.  In  early  phase  I  studies,  the  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  of  metabolites  KMD  3241  and  KMD  3289  were  determined.  Results  from  the  mass 
balance study indicated that these metabolites accounted for less than 2% of total radioactivity. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  and  time  dependencies  were  assessed  in  healthy  volunteers  including  older 
subjects (50-70) in a number of single-dose studies 95283, 98363, KMD3213-UK01-97, and repeat-
dose studies 95284, 98364, UK02-97, US011-98, KMD-207; while steady state PK parameters were 
assessed in studies SI06004, SI05008, and SI07004.  
Dose linearity of silodosin has been shown over a dose range of 0.1 mg to 48 mg. After multiple-dose 
administration, steady state of silodosin was reached on day 3 and no accumulation of silodosin after 
multiple  dose  compared  to  a  single  dose  administration  occurred.  The  KMD  3213G  metabolite 
exhibited  2-3  fold  increase  in  systemic  exposure  after  multiple  dose  administration.  At  steady  state 
KMD  3213G  reached  exposure  that  was  approximately  4.5-fold  that  of  silodosin.  Inter-individual 
variability for Cmax and AUC of silodosin in phase I studies ranged from 35% to 50%. 
•  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In  phase  III  study  SI04009  plasma  levels  of  silodosin  and  its  metabolites  were  monitored  in  233 
patients with BPH after first dose and following 4 weeks of therapy (8 mg once daily). Plasma samples 
were collected between 2 and 6 hours post-dose. Concentrations of silodosin, KMD 3213G and KMD 
3293 are presented below:

The data showed no significant accumulation of silodosin or metabolite KMD 3293 after four weeks 
of  treatment,  an  observation  that  is  congruent  with  the  known  half-life  of  these  two  moieties 
(approximately  11  hours).  Some  accumulation  was  observed  for  the  silodosin  glucuronide  after 
multiple dosing, as expected based on its longer half-life (approximately 18 hours). 
The pharmacokinetic analysis was also conducted in 2 phase II studies (US021-99, KMD-201) in 94 
patients. In the study US021-99 the peak plasma concentrations of silodosin were reached 1 to 2 hours 
post-dose, and ranged between 5.29 ng/mL and 49.30 ng/mL, after 4 and 8 mg doses. The metabolites 
reached peak plasma levels 1.5 to 4 hours (KMD 3293) or 1.5 to 6 hours (KMD 3213G) post-dose. In 
a 4-week repeat-dose study KMD-201 silodosin plasma concentrations 4 to 6 h after administration of 
the last dose were similar in patients <65 years and >65 years irrespective of the dose administered. 
Another  study (IT-PK 0241) investigated pharmacokinetics of 8 mg once daily silodosin in healthy 
adult  males  (45-64  years)  and  in  two  groups  of  elderly  men,  65  to  75  years  of  age  and  >75  years. 
Capsules  containing  8  mg  of  silodosin  were  administered  orally  for  7  days  30  min  after  a  standard 
breakfast. The levels of silodosin and its main metabolites at steady state were similar among subject 
with  different  ages:  group  A  (65-75  years),  group  B  (over  75  years)  and  group  C  (45-64  years). 
Population PK analysis indicated that steady-state concentrations would increase by approximately 1.2 
times when age is increased by 10 years from 67 years. Therefore it can be concluded that exposure to 
silodosin  and  its  metabolites  is  not  expected  to  change  significantly  with  age.  This  information  is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Two  studies  (KMD-309,  IT-PK  0234)  investigated  the  pharmacokinetics  of  silodosin  and  its 
metabolites  in  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment  (from  mild  to  severe)  and  healthy 
Page 28 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
controls after a single oral dose. In the first study the dose of 4 mg was administered to 13 participants 
under fasting conditions (6 patients and 7 controls), while in the second study most of the patients and 
healthy  controls  received  8  mg  (n=17  and  8,  respectively),  while  four  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment  were  given  4  mg.  The  drug  was  administered  after  a  standard  breakfast.  The  results 
showed  that  systemic  exposure  to  silodosin  and  KMD  3213G  metabolite  was  increased  2-fold  in 
patients with mild (50 ≤ CLCr ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) and moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ CLCr < 
50 mL/min/1.73 m2) after a single dose administration. In patients with severe renal failure (CLCr < 
30  mL/min/1.73  m2)  dose-normalised  Cmax  and  AUC  were  2-  to  4-fold  higher  than  in  healthy 
subjects. Population PK analysis (KMD-305) revealed that silodosin exposure is increased 1.2 times 
when serum creatinine is increased from 1.0 to 1.5 mg/dL.  
The CHMP has asked the applicant to further discuss these findings. Following the discussion it was 
acknowledged  that  the  2-3  fold  increase  in  exposure  of  silodosin  seen  in  patients  with  renal  failure 
might be caused by increased serum concentrations of the acid alpha 1-glycoprotein, a finding often 
encountered in the renally-impaired patients. Consequently, silodosin is not recommended in patients 
with  severe  renal  failure  and  a  starting  dose  of  4  mg  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  is 
proposed.  Based  on  the  efficacy  data  (in  placebo  controlled  studies  273  patients  with  mild  renal 
impairment  received  silodosin)  and  safety  data  (no  additional  safety  risks  were  identified),  no  dose 
reduction  is  required  in  the  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.  This  information  is  adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The study SI05010 investigated a single dose pharmacokinetics of silodosin in subjects with moderate 
liver dysfunction, and in healthy controls. The study was designed as a two-period crossover study, 9 
healthy volunteers and 9 subjects with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9) received 4 
mg and 8 mg of silodosin after a standard breakfast in period 1 and 2. Dosing periods were separated 
by  7-14  days.  The  indocyanine  green  test  was  performed  on  all  liver  dysfunction  subjects  to 
qualitatively evaluate liver function. 
Cmax  and  AUC  values for  total  concentrations of all  moieties  were slightly  lower  for subjects  with 
liver  dysfunction  compared  with  healthy  controls  (ratios  of  means  0.8  and  0.8,  respectively),  while 
Cmax and AUC values for unbound concentrations were slightly higher for silodosin (ratio of means 
1.1, 1.2), and slightly lower for KMD 3213G (0.9, 0.5) and KMD 3293 (0.9, 0.8). Vd of total silodosin 
was  234.3  (71.4)  L  and  280.8  (40.1)  L  in  control  subjects  for  a  dose  of  4  mg  and  8  mg;  and 
286.3(119.2) L and 447.5 (181.1) L in subjects with moderate liver failure for a dose of 4 mg and 8 
mg,  respectively.  Total  clearance  was  approximately  50%  increased  in  patients  with  moderate  liver 
failure. Relative to healthy controls renal clearance of unchanged silodosin as calculated from urinary 
data  appeared  larger  in  subjects  with  moderate  liver  dysfunction,  724.2  (188.0)  mL/h  versus  413.8 
(230.0) mL/h.  
The  CHMP  has  asked  the  applicant  to  submit  the  individual  Child-Pugh  scores  and  laboratory  test 
results  in  order  to  elucidate  the  reasons  for  the  unexpected  lower  silodosin  exposure  observed  in 
patients with moderate liver failure, as compared to healthy controls. The submitted data showed that 
one subject had Child-Pugh score 9, three subjects had score 8, and five additional subjects had the 
score  7  providing  reassurance  that  the  enrolled  patients  were  representative  of  a  population  with 
impaired  liver  function.  All  patients  had  normal  biochemistry  values;  except  for  the  patient  with 
Child-Pugh score 9, who had slightly decreased albumin levels. Most of the patients had clinical signs 
of liver failure including ascites and encephalopathy. It was therefore concluded that the unexpected 
lower silodosin exposure could be explained by an increased volume of distribution due to ascites. The 
Cmax  and  AUC  of  KMD  3213G  was  1.5  to  2  fold  lower  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment, 
indicating  lower  glucuronidation  in  subjects  with  liver  impairment.  These  results  are  expected  from 
the PK profile of silodosin. Since KMD 3213G is pharmacologically active and accounts for a part of 
pharmacological  activity  of  silodosin,  it  is  agreed  that  no  dose  reduction  is  needed  in  patients  with 
moderate liver failure. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

Gender, race and weight 
Silodosin is indicated for the treatment of BPH. No PK studies have been conducted in women and 
this is acceptable. 
No clinical studies were performed to specifically investigate the effect of race. However, a review of 
the pharmacokinetic data obtained in Caucasians and Japanese does not suggest a significant effect of 
race on the pharmacokinetics of silodosin or its main metabolites. 
Population PK showed that silodosin exposure is expected to be increased by 1.2-times when weight is 
decreased by 10 kg (from 64 kg to 54 kg). Therefore it can be concluded that weight does not affect 
systemic exposure of silodosin in a clinically significant manner. 
Children  
No specific studies have been performed in children. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Five  in  vivo  studies  investigated  effects  of  concomitant  medication  on  silodosin  and  its  main 
metabolites. Two studies were conducted with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (KMD-306-UK, 
SI06008), one study with diltiazem (IT-PK 02042), an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and two studies 
assessed  silodosin  effect  on  the  PK  of  digoxin  (KMD  307,  IT-PK  0263),  a  substrate  of  P-gp. 
Ketoconazole  was  found  to  cause  a  3-fold  increase  in  AUC  and  a  3-4-fold  increase  in  Cmax  of 
silodosin. AUC and Cmax of the metabolites were also increased but to a lesser extent. Yet, Kel of 
silodosin  was  only  slightly  reduced  (-18%)  by  ketoconazole,  and  that  of  the  metabolites  was 
unchanged. Ketoconazole markedly reduced CL/F by about 65% and Vz/F by about 55%. Ditiazem, a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased AUC of silodosin by approximately 30% and decreased the 
drug’s  apparent  clearance  by  26%,  while  Cmax  was  not  affected.  Diltiazem  increased  also  the 
exposure to metabolites KMD 3293 and KMD 3213G to a similar extent as the parent drug (32% and 
39%, respectively). In vitro data generated using Caco-2 cell monolayers have shown that silodosin is 
a substrate for P-gp. In the 2 in vivo studies after administration of silodosin no changes in the digoxin 
pharmacokinetics  at  steady-state  were  observed.  Overall  results  from  these  studies  indicate  that  no 
dose  reduction  is  needed  when  silodosin  is  co-administered  with  digoxin  or  diltiazem,  however 
caution  should  be  exercised  when  starting  concomitant  use  of  silodosin  and  antihypertensives. 
Silodosin should not be administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors since its exposure was increased 
by  3-fold  after  co-administration  with  ketoconazole.  Information  on  potential  for  drug-drug 
interactions is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Several  in  vitro  studies  were  performed  in  order  to  examine  the  potential  for  pharmacokinetic 
interactions of silodosin and its metabolites. Studies PK10049 and KMD 3213-IT-PK 0239 evaluated 
the effects of silodosin, KMD 3293 and KMD 3213G on the metabolic activities of CYP isoforms in 
human liver microsomes. In Study PK 03-010 possible effects of concomitant drugs (clarithromycin, 
cimetidine,  fluvoxamine,  diltiazem,  nifedipine,  verapamil,  glibenclamide,  prednisolone,  simvastatin, 
triazolam  and  ketokonazole  as  positive  control)  on  CYP3A4-mediated  metabolism  of  silodosin  to 
KMD-3241 were studied using CYP3A4-expressing microsomes, while study ZXA0002 investigated 
the  potential  of  silodosin  and  its  metabolites  KMD  3213G  and  KMD  3293  to  induce  CYP1A2  and 
CYP3A4/5  in  cryopreserved  human  hepatocytes.  The  results  of  in  vitro  studies  suggested  that 
silodosin  and  its  metabolites  KMD  3213G  and  KMD  3293  do  not  inhibit  CYP450  activity 
significantly.  There  is  no  indication  for  the  induction  of  either  CYP1A2  or  CYP3A4/5  by  silodosin 
and its two main metabolites.

Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action and primary pharmacology 
In the absence of a robust biomarker predictive of therapeutic response no specific pharmacodynamic 
were performed. In non-clinical studies, silodosin was shown to block the sympathetic nervous system 
via  the  α1A-AR  subtype  distributed  in  the  prostate,  urethra  and  trigone  of  the  bladder  to  relieve 
tension of the smooth muscles of lower urinary tract tissues. This reaction decreases urethral pressure, 
thereby improving the symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.  
The  preliminary  effects  of  silodosin  on  symptoms  of  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  were  assessed  in 
three  phase  I/II  clinical  studies  conducted  in  Japanese  patients  (KMD-201,  KMD-202,  KMD-206). 
Moreover,  a  phase  III  confirmatory  study  (KMD-303)  conducted  in  Japan  was  assigned  as  a 
supportive pharmacodynamic study for the European submission.  
The brief outline of the early studies is presented in the table.

Study  KMD-303  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group  controlled  study  comparing  4  mg 
silodosin BID (n=176), 0.2 mg tamsulosin (n=192) and placebo (n=89) over 12 weeks. Patients with 
micturition disorder associated with BPH who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled to the 
study:  total  IPSS  score  ≥8,  Qmax  <15  mL/sec,  residual  urine  volume  >100mL,  voiding  volume 
<100mL, prostate volume in ultrasound >20 mL, QOL ≥3. Eligible patients were 50 years and older.  
Primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the total score of IPSS at week 12 in the full analysis set. 
Various  secondary  outcome  measures,  including  change  in  Qmax,  were  also  determined.  The 
superiority  of  silodosin  to  placebo  was  confirmed  (p<0.001)  and  the  non-inferiority  of  silodosin  to 
tamsulosin  was  also  confirmed  (p<0.001)  for  the  primary  endpoint.  No  difference  between  the 
Page 31 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment  groups  for  the  maximum  flow  rate  was  observed,  while  silodosin  showed  superiority  to 
placebo  in  the  IPSS  obstructive  and  irritative  symptom  scores  (p<0.001  and  p=0.006,  respectively). 
Slightly  more  patients in  the  silodosin arm  discontinued  study  prematurely  (22  vs.  14  in  tamsulosin 
and  8  in  placebo  group).  The  incidence  of  adverse  drug  reactions  was  also  slightly  higher  in  the 
silodosin group (69.7%, 47.4% and 36.4% in the silodosin, tamsulosin and placebo group). The most 
common  adverse  event  in  the  silodosin  group  was  ejaculation  disorder  with  a  frequency  of  22%, 
whereas  in  the  tamsulosin  group  it  was  reported  in  1.6%  of  patients.  Adverse  events  related  to  the 
orthostatic  hypotension  occurred  with  a  frequency  of  5.7%,  6.8%  and  2.2%  in  the  silodosin, 
tamsulosin and placebo groups, respectively.  
•  Secondary pharmacology 
Silodosin effect on the prolongation of QT interval was investigated in the study SI05014. This was 
randomised, placebo controlled, four-arm parallel group investigation with 400 mg moxifloxacin as an 
active control (N=47). Silodosin was administered for 5 days at two different dose levels (8 mg and 24 
mg) to healthy male subjects aged 18-45 (N=48 and 45, respectively). A total of 50 ECGs per subject 
were planned to be analysed at baseline (5 ECGs x 10 time points). These baseline ECGs were used to 
construct  an  individually  corrected  QT  value  (QTcI)  in  addition  to  the  Bazett’s  and  Fridericia’s 
corrections. For the proposed therapeutic dose 8 mg of silodosin, the upper 90%CI for the difference 
was less than 10 msec throughout 24 h post dose. Mean change in QT interval was slightly higher for 
silodosin  24  mg  arm,  but  at  all  time  points  upper  90%CI  was  less  than  20  msec,  regardless  of 
correction.  It  was  therefore  concluded  that  no  significant  changes  in  QT  interval  were  observed 
compared to placebo. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In  the  absence  of  a  robust  biomarker,  no  rigorous  concentration-response  investigations  in  humans 
have been performed with silodosin to investigate PK/PD relationship. The PK of silodosin has been 
sufficiently  investigated  in  phase  I  studies,  therefore  further  studies  on  PK/PD  relationship  are  not 
required. 
•  Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal product or substances 
Another pharmacodynamic study (SI06002) examined interaction with PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and 
tadalafil.  The  study  was  primarily  designed  to  evaluate  the  effects  on  orthostatic  blood  pressure 
following co-administration of a single dose of 100 mg sildenafil, 20 mg tadalafil or placebo with 8 
mg silodosin at steady state. It was an open-label, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 
22 healthy male subjects of 45 years of age and older, including 6 subjects 65 years of age or older. 
Subjects received 8 mg silodosin daily for 21 days, representing three consecutive 7-day periods. At 
the  end  of  each  of  these  periods  (days  7,  14,  and  21),  the  subject  was  confined  to  the  clinic  for 
approximately 12 hours during which a PDE5 inhibitor (100 mg sildenafil, 20 mg tadalafil) or placebo 
were administered in the morning and orthostatic blood pressure tests were performed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6,  8,  and  12  hours  later.  No  significant  changes  in  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  occurred  when 
silodosin  was  co-administered  with  PDE5  inhibitors  at  a  maximum  daily  dose.  This  information  is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Clinical efficacy  
The  efficacy  of  silodosin  has  been  assessed  in  four  controlled  clinical  studies:  one  Phase  II  study 
conducted in the United Stated (US), and three Phase III studies, two of which were conducted in the 
US and one in Europe. Additionally, the long-term efficacy of silodosin was evaluated in two open-
label (OL) safety extension studies, one OL study conducted in the US (extension of studies SI04009 
and SI04010) and one conducted in Europe (extension of study IT-CL 0215). 
The  three  placebo-controlled  Phase  II/III  studies  conducted  in  the  US  enrolled  1,187  patients  with 
BPH. In the European Phase III study KMD-3213-IT-CL 0215 a total of 977 patients with BPH were 
randomised,  however,  the  final  analysis  excluded  22  subjects  from  one  of  the  clinical  sites  due  to 
inadequate adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The analyses presented further on are based on 
a  total  number  of  955  patients  enrolled  in  this  study.  Of  the  1,187  patients  enrolled  in  the  US 
controlled studies, 661 continued into a 9-month open-label study (SI04011). Similarly, 500 of the 955 
Page 32 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients enrolled in the EU controlled study continued into a 9 month open-label phase (IT-CL 0215 
OL extension phase), completing a 12 month treatment period. 
•  Dose response study 
Study  US021-99  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled, 
dose adjustment study designed to evaluate the effective dosage and tolerability of silodosin in patients 
with  BPH.  It  consisted  of  three  periods:  4-week  placebo  lead-in  period,  2-week  dose-adjustment 
period,  and  6-week  stable  dosing  period.  264  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  either  placebo 
(N=86), silodosin 4 mg (N=88) or silodosin 8 mg (N=90) once daily.  
The primary effectiveness parameters were change from baseline in the overall AUA Symptom Score, 
and  change  from  baseline  in  Qmax.  A  number  of  secondary  endpoints  including  proportion  of 
responders  at  each  visit  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period  were  assessed.  Responders  were 
defined  as  patients  who  have  a  ≥30%  improvement  in  Qmax  and  a  ≥25%  improvement  in  overall 
AUA Symptom Score. Safety was assessed by AEs, changes in physical examinations, monitoring of 
vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, orthostatic tests, and clinical laboratory tests.  
Statistically significant results were obtained on both co-primary endpoints for the 8 mg silodosin arm 
compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0018  and  p=0.0174,  respectively).  The  overall  AUA  Symptom  Score 
improved also in 4 mg group (p=0.0355), while the change in Qmax was not statistically significant 
for the lower dose. The differences in responders rate were statistically significant between the 8 mg 
group  and  the  placebo  group  for  the  AUA  symptom  index  score  responders,  and  between the  4  mg 
group and the placebo group for Qmax responders. Slightly more patients in the 8 mg silodosin arm 
experienced sexual dysfunction-type adverse events; retrograde ejaculation was more frequent in the 8 
mg group (15.6%), as compared to the 4 mg group (11.4%), and placebo (0%). Similarly, ejaculation 
failure was seen in 11.1% patients in the 8 mg group, 9.1% patients in the 4 mg group, while it did not 
occur in the placebo group. Dizziness, headache and positive orthostatic test occurred more often in 
the 4 mg arm. Based on the results from this study the 8 mg dose was chosen for further development. 
In the dose finding study the American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index was used for 
the primary efficacy assessment. This questionnaire is identical to the International Prostate Symptom 
Score  (IPSS),  used  in  the  placebo  controlled  US  studies  (SI04009,  SI04010)  and  in  the  active 
controlled  EU  study  (IT-CL0215),  except  that  it  does  not  contain  the  quality  of  life  question  (8th 
question  in  the  IPSS).  Hence,  AUA  Bother  Score  and  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  were  used  for 
secondary outcome assessment in the US021-99. 
•  Main study(ies)  
Two  placebo-controlled  studies  (SI04009  and  SI04010,  US  studies)  and  one  active-controlled  study 
(IT-CL-0215, European study) investigated the effect of 8 mg silodosin daily on the symptoms of BPH 
after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Long  term  safety  and  efficacy  data  were  collected  up  to  52  weeks  of 
treatment  in  an  open-label  extension  phase.  The  two  US  placebo-controlled  studies  (SI04009  and 
SI04010) had almost identical design. As mentioned above the Study IT-CL-0215 (a pivotal study for 
EU submission) was a three-arm study.  
Unless  specified  otherwise  the  information  presented  in  the  following  sections  applies  to  all  main 
studies. 
METHODS 
All  main  efficacy  studies  were  conducted  according  to  the  classical  randomised,  double-blinded, 
controlled design. They were multicentre and of 12-week duration. In all main studies 4-week single-
blind  placebo  run-in  period  preceded  12  weeks  of  therapy  with  silodosin,  placebo  or  active  control 
(study  IT-CL-0215).  Additionally,  the  study  IT-CL-0215  used  14-day  wash-out  period  prior  to  the 
placebo  run-in.  Study  IT-CL-0215  was  a  placebo-  and  active-controlled  (tamsulosin)  and  was 
conducted in 76 European sites located in Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, 
Romania, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, and the UK. At the end of all main studies patients had the option to 
enter a 40-week open-label extension.

Efficacy of silodosin was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).  
The  seven  questions  of  IPSS  are  identical  to  the  questions  of  the  American  Urological  Association 
Symptom  Index  (AUASI),  and  assess  urinary  symptoms  occurring  in  the  last  month  including 
incomplete  emptying,  frequency,  intermittent  stream,  urgency,  weak  stream,  straining,  and  nocturia. 
Questions 1-6 are graded using a 6-point scale with 0=”not at all” and 5=”almost always”, while for 
question 7 the descriptors vary from 0=”none” to 5=”5 or more times”. The total score is the sum of 
questions 1 through 7 with a maximum total score of 35 points. Sub-scores of irritative and obstructive 
symptoms is the sum of questions 2, 4, 7 and 1, 3, 5, 6, respectively. The symptom score is used to 
classify  the  severity  of  BPH  symptoms  as  mild  (score  0-7),  moderate  (8-19),  and  severe  (20-35). 
Additionally,  to  the  AUASI,  the  IPSS  includes  a  disease-specific  Quality  of  Life  (QoL)  question 
assessing  the  impact  of  urinary  symptoms  on  the  quality  of  life.  The  answers  to  this  question  are 
graded using a 7-point scale with 0=”delighted” and 6=”terrible” (Rosette et al. 2004, AUA guideline 
2003). 
The  AUA  symptom  score  was  first  published  in  1992  (Barry  et  al.)  and  assessed  the  severity  of 
symptoms during the last month. The score was not validated in men at similar age with and without 
BPH.  It was not established whether the score had a discriminatory power from other lower urinary 
tract symptoms (LUTS). LUTS may reflect obstructive voiding (weak urine flow, hesitancy, straining, 
incomplete  emptying)  or  bladder  storage  problems  (frequency,  urgency,  nocturia).  LUTS  are  often 
considered  to  be  due  to  BPH,  but  are  also  common  for  detrusor  overactivity  and  urodynamic  stress 
incontinence.  However,  from  the  existing  questionnaires  the  IPSS  has  been  most  widely  used,  also 
during  drug  development  and  therefore  enables  an  indirect  comparison  of  the  treatment  effect  with 
literature data. 
Study Participants  
The  study  population  consisted  of  male  subjects  aged  ≥  50  years  with  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia. 
The inclusion criteria were an IPSS score ≥ 13 and presence of bladder outlet obstruction as defined 
by a Qmax between 4 and 15 mL/sec, with a minimum voided volume of ≥ 125.  
Patients  with  post-void  bladder  residual  volume  greater  than  250  mL  determined  by  ultrasound, 
history  of  postural  hypotension  and  relevant  medical  conditions  (e.g.  prostate  or  bladder  cancer)  or 
receiving medications which might have produced confounding effects including alpha-blockers and 
5-alpha-reductase  inhibitors  were  excluded.  In  addition,  patients  with  marked  placebo  response,  i.e. 
greater than 30% decrease on the IPSS, or 3 mL/sec increase in Qmax in the US studies and >25% 
decrease  on  the  IPSS  in  the  EU  study  during  the  4-week,  single-blind,  placebo  run-in  were  also 
excluded.  
Treatments 
All studies dosed silodosin at 8 mg (2 capsules of 4 mg in US studies, 1 capsule of 8 mg in EU study), 
placebo  or  active  control  once  daily  at  breakfast  in  the  US  studies  (SI04009  and  SI04010)  or  after 
breakfast in the European study IT-CL-0215. The study IT-CL-0215 used tamsulosin 0.4 mg as active 
control. 
Objectives 
The primary objective in all three studies was to determine whether silodosin 8 mg given once daily 
for  12  weeks  is  superior  to  placebo for the relief  of symptoms  of  BPH;  the  European  study  IT-CL-
0215 evaluated also the non-inferiority of silodosin to tamsulosin 0.4 mg administered once daily.  
The  secondary  objectives  included  further  assessment  of  efficacy  (see  secondary  endpoints), 
assessment of quality of life and safety evaluation.  
Additionally, a pharmacokinetic analysis of silodosin and major metabolites (plasma concentrations) 
was conducted during the SI04009 study only (see section on pharmacokinetics). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the total score of IPSS (Questions 1-7 referring to 
symptoms). 
Page 34 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary outcomes of the studies were: 
• a baseline to endpoint change in the maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), and 
•  irritative  and  obstructive  symptoms  subscales  of  the  IPSS  and  QOL  due  to  urinary  symptoms 
(question 8 of the IPSS), 
•  the  safety  of  silodosin  compared  to  placebo  using  an  evaluation  of  adverse  events,  vital  signs 
(including orthostatic test), ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, and physical exams. 
Additional secondary endpoints in the IT-CL 0215 study included:  
• percentage of respondents to IPSS, defined as percentage of patients with ≥ 25% decrease in IPSS 
compared to baseline,  
• percentage of respondents to Qmax, defined as percentage of patients with ≥ 30% increase in Qmax 
compared to baseline. 
The  CHMP  has  considered  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  as  appropriate  given  that  the 
assessment  of  symptom  severity  is  the  most  important  outcome  measure  from  the  patient’s 
perspective. 
Sample size 
In  the  US  studies  (SI04009,  SI04010)  the  sample  size  considerations  were  based  on  a  statistical 
estimation of the number of patients needed to achieve at least 90% power in the comparison of the 
silodosin treatment group to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. the difference of 1.54 of 
mean  change  from  baseline  in  IPSS  total  score.  The  common  standard  deviation  of  change  from 
baseline in IPSS total score was estimated as 5.2 based on previous studies. It was estimated that with 
90%  power  using  a  two-sided  t-test  and  Z=0.05  the  difference  between  treatment  groups  could  be 
detected  with  240  patients  (20%  drop-out  of  300  patients)  completing  the  study  in  each  treatment 
group.  
In the European study (IT-CL-0215) the value of 2 was assumed as the minimum clinically significant 
difference  to  be  used  in  sample  size  calculation  for  the  comparison  between  active  treatments  and 
placebo  (superiority),  while  1.5  was  the  value  considered  as  the  maximum  difference  not  clinically 
relevant for the comparison between two active treatments (non-inferiority). Taking into account the 
assumptions  above,  assuming  a  randomisation  ratio  silodosin:  tamsulosin:  placebo  2:2:1,  a  common 
standard deviation of 5.2 and a 0.025 one-sided significance level, a sample size of 260 subjects for 
each active treatment group and of 130 subjects for the placebo group has 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the two active treatments are not equivalent, when the difference in mean change from 
baseline  in  IPSS  total  score  is  1.5  or  less.  This  sample  size  would  be  also  sufficient  to  detect  a 
difference of 2 in IPSS total symptom score between each active group and placebo using a two-sided 
test at 0.05 significance level and 90% power. 
Randomisation  
The  US  studies  SI04009,  SI04010  randomised  patients  in  a  1:1  allocation  scheme  to  receive  either 
placebo or silodosin 8 mg, respectively. In the European study IT-CL-0215, patients were randomised 
according  to  a  2:2:1  scheme  to  receive  either  silodosin  8  mg,  tamsulosin  0.4  mg  or  placebo.  A 
randomisation schedule was produced using a block size of 5 to achieve the 2:2:1 ratio. The subject 
randomisation codes were to be allocated sequentially in the order in which subjects were randomised. 
A number of randomisation irregularities were noted in the US studies including the allocation of the 
same  treatment  pack  to  two  patients  in  one  of  the  centres  due  to  a  transcription  error.  They  were 
deemed not to have had an important impact on the results.  
Blinding (masking) 
All  main  studies  were  double-blind  with  blinding  maintained  throughout  by  use  of  identical 
medication packaging and a placebo that matched active treatment in size and external appearance. In 
the  study  IT-CL-0215  the  blinding  procedures  included  over-encapsulation  of  tamsulosin  with  the 
same capsules used for silodosin and placebo; double blind labelling with the subject randomisation 
number  and  a  unique  code  identifying  the  global  batch  which  maintained  blinding  of  the  study 
Page 35 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medication.  Dissolution  study  results  presented  in  response  to  the  CHMP  request  demonstrated  that 
the over-encapsulation of tamsulosin did not affect the bioavailability of the drug. All studies used a 
statistical analysis plan that was approved before the study blind was broken. Any additional analyses 
that  were implemented  after  the  blind  was  broken  were  clearly  described as  post-hoc  in  the  clinical 
study reports. 
Statistical methods 
For all main studies Intent-to-treat and modified ITT analyses included all randomised patients who 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  double  blind  study  medication  and  had  the  IPSS  assessment  either  at 
baseline in the US studies SI04009, SI04010, or both at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit 
(EU Study IT-CL-0215). In the EU study the PP (per protocol) population was defined as all patients 
in  the  ITT  population  without  any  major  protocol  violations.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  this 
study was analysed for both the ITT and the PP populations; the primary population for the primary 
efficacy variable was stated to be the PP population for the non-inferiority analysis and the ITT for the 
superiority comparisons.  
The analysis of the primary efficacy variable was planned using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with centre  and treatment as  effects and the  baseline  value as covariate.  In  the US  studies  SI04009, 
SI04010  the  pooling  algorithm  would  not  apply  and  the  centre  effect  would  be  removed  from  the 
analysis  model  if  more  than  10%  or  more  than  5  centres  were  small.  No  centre  effect  on  the  study 
results  was  observed  in  the  post-hoc  analyses  submitted  at  the  request  of  the  CHMP  providing 
reassurance on the consistency and robustness of pooled results. Hypotheses were tested at the two-
sided 5% level of significance. As only one comparison was required between silodosin and placebo in 
the US studies SI04009, SI04010, no adjustment for multiplicity was necessary. In the European study 
IT-CL-0215  the  superiority  of  the  active  treatments,  silodosin  and  tamsulosin  versus  placebo  were 
tested first. If both were statistically established the superiority of silodosin compared with tamsulosin 
was tested subsequently. As this stepwise procedure was used no adjustments were made for multiple 
testing of the primary endpoint.  
The ‘last observation carried forward’ approach (LOCF) was applied for the handling of missing data 
for the primary  efficacy  endpoint.  A  number  of  sensitivity  analyses,  including  ‘baseline  observation 
carried  forward’  (BOCF),  were  conducted  in  order  to  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the 
analysis of the LOCF dataset in the US studies SI04009, SI04010.   
In  the  US  studies  subgroup  analyses  were  pre-defined  by  race  and  by  geriatric  status.  A  number  of 
post-hoc  analyses  were  carried  out  including  an  analysis  of  subgroups  based  on  baseline  creatinine 
clearance. 
In  general,  the  statistical  methods  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  were 
considered to be appropriate.

A total of 351 patients in the study SI04009, 264 in the study SI04010 and 149 in the EU study IT-CL-
0215 were not randomised following the placebo run-in.  
Conduct of the study 
In the IT-CL-0215 study subjects from one of the centres were excluded from the statistical analysis 
following  concerns  regarding  the  GCP  compliance  of  the  site.  Other  most  frequently  reported 
violations that resulted in the exclusion of subjects from the PP population were a major violation of 
the  IPSS  questionnaire  (missing  or  invalid  IPSS  total  score  at  baseline  or  at  week  12)  and  major 
violation  of  compliance  (overall  compliance  during  the  double  blind  treatment  period  or  at  the  last 
visit week 12 outside 80-120%). Three, four, and two patients in the silodosin, tamsulosin and placebo 
arm  received  prohibited  concomitant  medications.  Minor  amendments  were  made  to  the  US  study 
protocols  SI04009  and  SI04010.  They  were  reviewed  and  approved  by  an  independent  ethics 
committee prior to implementation. The protocol violations were considered to have not affected the 
statistical analysis. 
Baseline data 
US  studies  SI04009  and  SI04010:  Demographic  characteristics,  general  and  urological  medical 
history  were  similar  for  the  treatment  arms  in  both  studies.  Mean  age  was  64  and  65  years  in  the 
SI04009 and SI04010, respectively. In study SI04009, 195 (42.3%) were older than 65 years and 52 
(11.3%) were older than 75 years. Approximately 87.6% of subjects were Caucasian, 6.3% Hispanic 
3.7% African American and 1.7% Asian. In study SI04010, 220 (47.6%) were older than 65 years and 
63 (13.6%) were older than 75 years. Approximately 90.9% of subjects were Caucasian, 4.1% African 
American, 3.5% Hispanic and 0.6% Asian. 
EU study IT-CL-0215: Baseline demographic characteristics, medical history and efficacy variables 
were similar for the treatment groups. Mean age was 66 years, mean weight 80 kg, mean height 173 
cm. All subjects enrolled in this study were Caucasian therefore the CHMP has requested the applicant 
to  discuss  generalisability  of  results  to  non-Caucasian  patients.  In  their  response  the  applicant  has 
provided reassurance that results obtained in EU study could be extrapolated to other ethnic groups as 
PK  studies  did  not  suggest  any  meaningful  differences  between  races  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
silodosin,  no  clinically  meaningful  treatment  differences  were  observed  between  the  races  on  any 
efficacy parameter in the US studies and data available from Asian patients suggested similar efficacy. 
Numbers analysed 
In  the  US  studies  (SI04009,  SI04010)  efficacy  assessment  was  planned  to  be  performed  using  the 
following patient populations: 
• Intent-to-treat (ITT) population – all randomised patients who provided data for the primary efficacy 
variable at baseline; patients were included ‘as randomised’,  
•  Modified  Intent-to-Treat  (mITT)  population  –  all  randomised  patients  who  provided  data  for  the 
primary efficacy variable at baseline; patients were included ‘as treated’.

In  the  European  study  IT-CL-0215  the  primary  populations  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy 
variable was the PP population for the non-inferiority analysis (silodosin vs tamsulosin) and the ITT 
population for the superiority analyses (silodosin vs placebo, tamsulosin vs placebo and, if applicable, 
silodosin vs. tamsulosin).

In the EU study the ITT population represented a ‘modified’ ITT population as 23 randomised patients 
without post baseline IPSS assessment have been excluded. The additional analysis presented in the 
response  to  the  CHMP  request  which  included  all  randomised  patients  confirmed  that  this 
modification had no impact on results of superiority and non-inferiority analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
US studies SI04009 and SI04010: 
Mean changes from baseline in the primary efficacy parameter (IPSS total score) are presented below 
(mITT). 
At the primary endpoint, silodosin was significantly superior to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. 
The treatment effect was seen already after 1 week of therapy and change in the IPSS score compared 
with placebo was maintained over the 12-week treatment period. Following the request of the CHMP 
the  applicant  has  provided  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  focusing  on  the  estimated 
treatment differences from the ANCOVA with the associated 95% confidence intervals and results of 
the analysis of the primary endpoints for the evaluable patient population. The findings across the two 
studies  and  between  evaluable  and  mITT  populations  were  similar,  i.e.  silodosin  vs.  placebo  -2.8  in 
study SI04009 and -2.9 in study SI04010, respectively.

- Treatment with silodosin was superior to placebo with respect to the change from baseline to week 
12 in the total IPSS score in both the ITT and the PP populations. 
- Treatment with silodosin was non-inferior to treatment with tamsulosin with respect to the change 
from baseline to week 12 in the total IPSS score in both the ITT and the PP populations. 
-  Treatment  effect  with  silodosin  was  greater  than  with  tamsulosin,  but  this  difference  was  not 
statistically significant.

In  the  EU  study  results  for  secondary  variables  were  consistent  across  treatment  groups  and  were 
similar to those observed in the US studies except for Qmax. The percentage of responders on IPSS 
(≥25%  decrease)  was  66.8%,  65.4%  and  50.8%  in  the  silodosin,  tamsulosin  and  placebo  group, 
respectively, and was statistically significant vs. placebo (p<0.001). The percentage of responders on 
Qmax (≥30% increase) was 46.6%, 46.5% and 40.5% in the silodosin, tamsulosin and placebo group, 
respectively, without significant differences between the treatment groups (p>0.1).  
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Three US studies were included in the integrated summary of efficacy: one phase II study (US021-99) 
and two phase III studies (SI04009 and SI04010). The integration was performed with two data groups 
that reflect the differences in study design. The first integrated group included all three studies. The 
second integrated group included only the two placebo-controlled US phase III studies. Data analysis 
was performed on the mITT and evaluable population. 
An  integrated  analysis  of  efficacy  from  the  phase  II  and  phase  III  studies  revealed  consistent  and 
statistically  significant  results  on  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints.  The  difference  in  the  mean 
change from baseline between the silodosin and placebo arms was -2.8 with the lower 95%CI of -2.0. 
Silodosin’s effect on symptoms of BPH as measured by a change from baseline in the IPSS total score 
exceeded that of placebo in a statistically significant manner (p<0.0001). The mean change in the total 
IPSS score was -6.4, versus -3.6 for placebo (all US studies). Statistically significant effect between 
the  placebo  and  silodosin  was  revealed  already  after  approximately  0.5  week  of  therapy  with 
reductions in the IPSS scores of -4.2 versus -2.3 for placebo (p<0.0001) in phase III studies. 
In phase III studies, silodosin’s effect on irritative and obstructive symptoms of BPH as measured by a 
change  from  baseline  in  the  subscale  scores  exceeded  that  of  placebo  in  a  statistically  significant 
manner (p<0.0001). The mean change in the irritative score was -2.3 versus -1.4 for placebo, and in 
the  obstructive  score  -4.0  versus  -2.1  for  placebo.  Similarly,  silodosin  effect  on  Qmax  was 
significantly superior to that of placebo (p=0.0007). The mean change in Qmax was 2.6 mL/sec versus 
1.5 mL/sec for placebo. Similar onset of effect (2-6 hours post first dose) as that noted in the IPSS and 
subscales scores was observed for the Qmax.  
The  integrated  analysis  did  not  identify  any  age,  race  or  renal  function  related  differences  in  the 
efficacy.  For  the  first  integrated  group  (all  US  studies)  7.2%  patients  on  silodosin  arm  and  1.9% 
patients on placebo arm discontinued the study due to adverse event. 
Additional analyses were submitted following the CHMP request:  
1.  Post-hoc  responder  analysis  including  placebo  responders  in  the  run-in  period;  responders  were 
defined as subjects showing a decrease in the total IPSS score ≥25% as compared to baseline. 
In  the  European  study  IT-CL-0215  149  patients  who  entered  placebo  run-in  were  excluded  from 
randomisation. For the post hoc analysis, 31 additional subjects were included and randomly assigned 
Page 40 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to one of the three treatment arms. The 118 patients who were not included in the post-hoc analysis 
did not meet the inclusion criteria, suffered from adverse events, voluntarily withdrew from the study, 
were lost to follow-up or discontinued the treatment upon the investigator recommendation.  
In the US studies 351 patients in the study SI04009 and 264 in the study SI04010 were not randomised 
following the placebo run-in; 125 out of 351 and 106 out of 264 patients were included in the post-hoc 
analysis. The reasons for non randomising remaining  patients were similar to those in the European 
study. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
In  the  EU  study  IT-CL0215,  the  inclusion  of  placebo-responders  in  the  post-hoc  analysis  did  not 
change the original conclusions of the study on efficacy. Also in the post-hoc analysis responder rates 
were significantly higher in the silodosin than in the placebo arm.  
Similar  findings  were  observed  in  the  US  studies;  the  inclusion  of  placebo-responders  in  the  run-in 
period, according to the IPSS data, did not change the efficacy conclusions of silodosin superiority vs. 
placebo. 
2. Subgroup analysis in patients with moderate (IPSS<20) and severe symptoms (IPSS>20) 
Post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  have  been  conducted,  separately  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe 
symptoms (IPSS total score < 20 or ≥ 20, respectively) to evaluate whether silodosin is effective also 
in patients with the moderate condition.  
The results from the European study are presented in the tables. 
Page 41 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similar results were observed in both US studies; the difference between placebo and silodosin arm 
was  statistically  significant  in  patients  with  IPSS<20  and  with  IPSS≥20,  with  slightly  more 
pronounced difference in patients with severe condition. 
Additional  analysis  provided  by  the  applicant  confirmed  that  the  treatment  effect  observed  both  in 
patients  with  moderate  and  severe  condition  was  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  in  the  whole 
patient population. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
No formal studies in special populations were conducted. Race, age and renal function were not found 
to  be  associated  with  the  efficacy  of  silodosin  in  phase  III  studies  based  on  subgroup  analysis 
conducted for the US studies. 
•  Supportive study(ies) 
Long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  silodosin  was  investigated  in  two  open-label  non-comparative 
studies. At the end of the US studies, SI04009 and SI04010, patients had an option to enter a 40-week 
open-label  extension  study  (SI04011).  Similarly,  after  the  completion  of  the  EU  study  IT-CL-0215 
patients  were  enrolled  into  an  open-label  extension  phase  of  the  study  that  lasted  40  weeks.  The 
primary objective in both studies was the safety of silodosin 8 mg given once daily for 40 weeks. The 
secondary objective was to evaluate the sustained efficacy of silodosin 8 mg given once daily for 40 
weeks for the relief of the signs and symptoms of BPH as measured by the change in the IPSS score. 
In addition, two long-term open-label studies (up to 52 weeks of treatment) had been conducted with 
the silodosin 4 mg bid for the submission in Japan. Study KMD-203 was an extension of the KMD-
Page 42 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
202 (see section on Pharmacodynamics). Thirty eight patients were enrolled in the 2 mg bid and 37 
patients  in  the  4  mg  bid  group;  28  and  26  patients, respectively,  completed  the  52  week  open  label 
treatment. Due to a limited data set, efficacy results from this study are not discussed here in details. 
Study  KMD-305  was  initiated  as  an  open  label  single  arm  (4  mg  bid  silodosin,  2  mg  bid  if  not 
tolerated) treatment for 52 weeks.  
SI04011 
Visit 1 of this study occurred on the same day as the last visit of the double blind study. 661 men with 
signs and symptoms of BPH received silodosin 8 mg once daily at breakfast. ECGs were performed at 
Week  8  and  40,  clinical  laboratory  tests  and  vital  signs  were  performed  at  Week  8,  16  and  40  or 
discharge  and  a  physical  examination  was  performed  at  Week  40  or  discharge.  The  IPSS  was 
completed  at  Week  8  and  40  or  discharge.  Qmax  was  not  assessed.  A  total  of  661  patients  were 
enrolled  and  435  patients  completed  the  study.  The  discontinuation  rate  was  34.2%.  Ninety  three 
patients  (14.1%)  withdrew  due  to  adverse  events,  58  (8.8%)  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  33  (5%) 
discontinued voluntarily and 21 (3.2%) were lost to follow-up.  
Data showed that silodosin 8 mg once daily was effective in treating the symptoms of BPH for up to 9 
months. Patients who had received placebo during the double blind study had larger decreases in the 
IPSS  (-3.0±6.2)  than  patients  who  had  received  silodosin  (-1.0±5.5).  However,  patients  who  had 
previously  received  silodosin  continued  to  have  meaningful  effect  on  their  BPH  symptoms  (IPSS 
score). Similar results were observed on the irritative and obstructive symptoms subscale.  
In  conclusion,  patients  who  had  received  placebo  in  the  double-blind  phase,  demonstrated 
improvement in the IPSS score at week 40 in the same order of magnitude as reported for silodosin 
arm at the end of 12-week treatment (i.e. end of the double blind phase).  
IT-CL 0215 open label  
After completion of the double-blind phase, a total of 54 centres enrolled 509 subjects into an open-
label phase. Four visits were planned: at week 14, week 26, week 39 and week 52 (or earlier, in case 
of  premature  study  termination)  after  double-blind  period.  The  IPSS  score,  Qmax  and  ECG  were 
assessed at Week 26, 39, and 52 at 2-6 hours after dosing. Overall 56 (11.2%) patients discontinued 
the  study  prematurely,  including  19  (3.8%)  due  to  adverse  event.  9  subjects  enrolled  at  one  of  the 
centres were excluded from the analysis due to an inadequate GCP compliance. 
Change from baseline in the total IPSS score for the open-label safety population is summarised in the 
figure. 
With reference to the IPSS total score, a marked reduction (-2.7±3.8) was observed at the first visit, 
after 14 weeks of an open-label treatment in subjects previously treated with placebo, while a smaller 
improvement was observed in subjects previously treated with silodosin or tamsulosin (-0.82±4.2 and 
Page 43 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-0.83±3.8,  respectively.  The  treatment  effect  was  maintained  up  to  52  weeks.  Similar  findings  were 
observed  for  the  irritative  and  obstructive  symptoms  subscores.  No  clinically  significant  changes  in 
Qmax measurements were observed in the open-label extension phase. No formal statistical analysis 
was performed. 
Study KMD-305 enrolled 364 patients with signs and symptoms of BPH; inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and safety/efficacy assessment were similar to those in other studies. 260 patients completed an open-
label  52-week  treatment  with  4  mg  bid  silodosin  (if not  tolerated  2  mg  bid).  Sixty  three  out  of  104 
patients discontinued due to adverse events. The reported change in the total IPSS score in numerical 
terms was similar to other studies (difference between weeks 12 and 52 – (-2.3)).  
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  silodosin  in  the  treatment  of  signs  and  symptoms  of  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia 
(BPH) was assessed in three main studies, two placebo-controlled US studies (SI04009, SI04010) and 
one active-controlled European study (IT-CL-0215). The CHMP has discussed the following efficacy 
aspects of the main studies: 
a) 
Patients eligible at screening but demonstrating a significant placebo response after a 4-week 
placebo run-in period in phase III efficacy studies were excluded from randomisation. It is expected 
that  the  real  treatment  effect  is  smaller  than  reported  for  the  enriched  population  in  the  efficacy 
studies.  
Subsequently, the post-hoc analysis including also placebo responders from all three main studies was 
performed.  Placebo  responders  were  defined  as  subjects  showing  a  decrease  in  the  total  IPSS  score 
>25% in  the  run-in  period.  Additional  231  subjects  in  the  US  studies  (125  and  106  in  SI04009  and 
SI04010,  respectively)  and  31  in  the  European  study  were  included  in  the  post-hoc  analysis.  The 
reasons  for  not  including  the  remaining  subjects  were  discussed  sufficiently  by  the  applicant  and 
acknowledged by the CHMP. The inclusion of placebo-responders in the analysis did not change the 
original conclusions of silodosin superiority versus placebo and non inferiority versus tamsulosin.  
The  applicant  was  also  asked  to  justify  why  the  cut-off  >13  in  the  IPSS  score  was  chosen  for  the 
inclusion  in  the  phase  III  efficacy  studies.  Consequently,  a  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis  has  been 
conducted separately  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  symptoms  (IPSS  total  score  <  20  or  ≥ 20, 
respectively) in order to evaluate the efficacy of silodosin with respect to the severity of the condition. 
The  results  confirmed  that  the  treatment  effect  observed  both  in  patients  with  moderate  and  severe 
condition was in the same order of magnitude in as in the whole patient population.  
The choice of the clinically important difference (-2 points) and the non-inferiority margin (-
b) 
1.5 points) for study IT-CL-0215 has not been sufficiently justified either statistically or clinically. In 
addition, the clinical relevance of the treatment effect, namely -2.3 to -2.8 points change in the IPSS 
score on the silodosin arm compared to placebo should be established.  
The literature data review submitted in response to the CHMP question demonstrated that the change 
in  the  IPSS  score  from  baseline  observed  in  silodosin  arms  was  similar  to  those  reported  for  other 
alpha-blockers providing justification for the non-inferiority margin. Similarly, the value of -2 points 
in  the  IPSS  total  score  was  considered  as  clinically  relevant  based  upon  previous  clinical  evidence 
showing that the minimum level of perception of improvement among men with moderate symptoms 
was set at -1.9 points. In addition, recently published meta-analysis on alpha-blockers also showed that 
the  difference  from  placebo  in  American  Urological  Association  Symptom  Index/International 
Prostate Symptom Score was -1.92 points (95%CI: -2.71 to -1.14). Hence, it can be concluded that the 
treatment effect observed in the European study was similar to that observed in other trials with alpha-
blocking agents. 
c) 
Duration of the main efficacy studies was 12 weeks. No placebo controlled efficacy data are 
available beyond 12 weeks of treatment. The long term benefits of silodosin have not been established. 
No regulatory guideline exists on the investigation of products for the treatment of BPH. In previous 
clinical studies with drugs approved for BPH, the duration of main efficacy studies has been 12 weeks 
due to the fact that alpha-blocking agents show immediate therapeutic benefits. 
Page 44 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Answering  to  the  requests  to  provide  data  beyond  12  weeks  of  treatment,  the  applicant  emphasised 
that the long-term benefits of silodosin have been shown in two open-label long-term studies in more 
than 900 patients treated for at least 6 months, and in more than 300 patients treated for 12 months. In 
both  studies  the  treatment  effect  appeared  soon  after  treatment  initiation  and  was  maintained  over 
time.  In  acknowledging  the  response  the  CHMP  underlined  the  limited  validity  related  to  an 
uncontrolled design of the open-label extension trials. 
Clinical safety 
A total of 36 clinical studies that provide safety data of silodosin were conducted in Europe, US and 
Japan involving both, healthy subjects or patients. More than 3000 subjects received at least one dose 
of the drug. Additional safety information is available from post-marketing experience in Japan from 
January 2006 until January 2008. 
•  Patient exposure 
For the purpose of this application the overall silodosin safety population used to calculate frequencies 
of adverse events was integrated from the main controlled and open-label extension trials. A total of 
1581 patients were exposed of which 961 (62.4%) were exposed for 6 months or more (438 patients 
<65 years, 523 patients >65 years) and 384 patients (24.9%) were exposed for 12 months or more (179 
patients <65 years, 205 patients >65 years). 931 patients received daily doses of 8 mg silodosin and a 
total of 733 patients received placebo. 
Demographic characteristics of the integrated safety population are shown below. 
Page 45 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally,  88  patients  were  exposed  to  4  mg  of  silodosin  for  8  weeks  in  the  dose-finding  study 
US021-99. 
A total of 873 Japanese patients with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH were exposed to silodosin 
doses  ranging  from  0.2  mg  up  to  8  mg/daily,  with  650  patients  administered  8  mg/daily  (mean 
exposure 211 days ± 146 days). 
Safety  data  collected  in  healthy  volunteers  or  in  special  populations  (elderly  volunteers,  renal 
insufficiency)  from  PK  studies  was  not  integrated,  but  described  separately.  Twenty-five  clinical 
pharmacology studies were performed in a total of 595 subjects treated with silodosin at doses ranging 
from 0.1 mg to 48 mg. 
Size  of  the  safety  population,  both  in  terms  of  number  of  patients  and  duration  of  treatment,  meets 
requirements  in  the  ICH  Topic  E1  “Population  Exposure:  The  Extent  of  Population  Exposure  to 
Assess  Clinical  Safety”.  Demographic  characteristics  of  the  integrated  safety  population  are 
representative of the target patient population. 
•  Adverse events  
In placebo controlled trials adverse reactions were observed in 268/931 (28.8%) patients treated with 
silodosin  and  66/733  (9.0%)  patients  receiving  placebo.  Across  all  studies  in  the  integrated  safety 
population the most common (>1%) adverse reactions were retrograde ejaculation (23.6%), dizziness 
(2.1%),  orthostatic  hypotension  (1.3%),  nasal  congestion  (1.3%),  headache  (1.3%)  and  diarrhoea 
(1.0%).  The  adverse  reactions  observed  in  more  than  one  patient  in  the  overall  safety  population 
included testicular pain, urinary hesitation, urticaria, pruritus, arthralgia and blurred vision (N=2 each, 
0.1%). 
The  occurrence  of  adverse  reactions  was  not  associated  with  the  onset  or  duration  of  treatment.  No 
remarkable  age-related  difference  was  seen  in  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  considered  related  to 
study treatment with the exception of retrograde ejaculation which was observed at a higher frequency 
in younger subjects (<65 yrs and <75 yrs vs. >65 and >75 yrs, 32.4% and 25.7% vs. 14.7% and 6.8%, 
respectively). 
Study US021-99 investigated the efficacy and safety of 4 mg daily (n=88) and 8 mg daily (n=90) of 
silodosin. As mentioned earlier, slightly more patients in the 8 mg silodosin arm experienced sexual 
dysfunction-type adverse events: retrograde ejaculation (15.6% vs. 11.4% in the 4 mg group and 0% in 
placebo arm) and ejaculation failure (11.1% vs. 9.1% patients in the 4 mg group, while it did not occur 
in the placebo group). Dizziness (8% vs. 5.6%), headache (5.7% vs. 2.2%) and positive orthostatic test 
(4.5% vs. 3.3%) occurred slightly more often in the 4 mg than in the 8 mg arm. The differences were 
not statistically significant. 
In  Japanese  studies  adverse  drug  reactions  were  observed  in  391/873  (44.8%)  patients  treated  with 
silodosin and in 28/178 (15.7%) patients treated with placebo.

The information on adverse events is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Three deaths occurred in the US clinical development programme of silodosin: 
• acute myocardial infarction in a silodosin patient, considered not related by the investigator 
• pulmonary embolism in a silodosin patient, considered not related by the investigator 
• cerebral haemorrhage in a placebo patient. 
In the European study IT-CL 0215 there were two deaths: 
•  severe  lung  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (stage  unspecified)  in  a  silodosin  patient,  considered  not 
related by the investigator; 
•  lung  neoplasm  malignant,  renal  cell  carcinoma  (stage  unspecified),  and  adrenal  carcinoma  in  a 
tamsulosin patient, considered not related by the investigator. 
In  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  occurred  in  10/931  (1.1%)  with 
silodosin  and  8/733  (1.1%)  with  placebo.  Overall,  SAEs  were  reported  by  47/1581  patients  on 
silodosin.  SAEs  occurring  in  more  than  one  patient  were:  myocardial  infarction  (5  cases), 
osteoarthritis  (4  cases),  lung  neoplasm  and  prostate  cancer  (3  cases,  each),  gastric  cancer,  atrial 
fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, hip arthroplasty, urinary retention and diverticulitis (2 cases each). 
One  case  of  myocardial  infarction  was  considered  possibly  related since  there was  no  other  evident 
pre-existing or concomitant condition that could explain the onset of the infarction. Nevertheless, this 
event  occurred  after  9  months  of  silodosin  treatment,  during  which  blood  pressure,  heart  rate  and 
ECGs had remained normal. One case of supraventricular arrhythmia was also reported in a 69-year-
old patient with a relevant medical history of arterial hypertension. It was regarded as possibly related 
to the treatment. 
One  case  of  syncope  occurred  in  a  patient  enrolled  in  the  US  study  SI04010,  also  receiving  a 
prohibited  concomitant  medication,  the  alpha-blocker  prazosin.  Since  some  cases  of  syncope  have 
been reported in the postmarketing experience in Japan, syncope is considered as an identified risk and 
discussed in the  Risk  Management  Plan. Moreover, the  appropriate  guidance  on  concomitant  use  of 
other alpha blockers has been included in the SmPC. 
A  formal  ECG  trial  (study  SI05014)  demonstrated  that  silodosin  at  therapeutic  (8  mg)  and  supra-
therapeutic (24 mg) doses had no meaningful effects on heart rate, PR, and QRS interval duration. The 
effects  on  cardiac  repolarisation,  did  not  suggest  that  silodosin  affected  cardiac  repolarisation.  With 
regard to the EU/US phase II/III studies, no meaningful effect of silodosin on ECG categorisation was 
observed during the therapy for up to 1 year. 
Page 47 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three  cases  of  prostatic  cancer  were  reported.  Since  BPH  and  prostate  carcinoma  may  present  the 
same symptoms and can co-exist, patients suspected to have BPH should be examined prior to starting 
therapy with an alpha-blocker to rule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate. The misdiagnosis 
of  prostatic  carcinoma  during  silodosin  treatment  is  considered  a  potential  risk  and  appropriate 
guidance has been included in the SmPC. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
The  “Intraoperative  Floppy  Iris  Syndrome”  (IFIS,  a  variant  of  small  pupil  syndrome)  has  been 
observed  during  cataract  surgery  predominantly  in  some  patients  on  or  previously  treated  with 
tamsulosin. One case of IFIS occurred also with silodosin in the US open-label study SI04011 and in 
the post-marketing experience in Japan, while no cases were reported in the European study. Isolated 
reports have also been reported with other α-1 blockers, and the possibility of a class effect cannot be 
excluded. As IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications during the cataract operation, the 
ophthalmic surgeon should be informed before surgery on current or past use of α-1 blockers. IFIS is 
considered an identified risk and discussed in the Risk Management Plan. Appropriate guidance has 
been also included in the SmPC. 
•  Laboratory findings 
Hypercreatininaemia was reported by 3 patients, however overall there is no evidence indicating that 
silodosin treatment may deteriorate renal function.  
In non-clinical studies silodosin induced stimulation of TSH secretion in the male rat and decreased 
circulating  levels  of  thyroxine  (T4).  In  clinical  studies  including  40  weeks  open  label  phase,  blood 
TSH  increased  was  reported  in  3  patients.  There  was  no  evidence  that  silodosin  may  affect  thyroid 
function.  Moreover,  in  female  mice  treated  for  2  years  with  silodosin  doses  of  150  mg/kg/day  or 
greater had statistically significant increases in the incidence of mammary gland adenoacanthoma and 
adenocarcinomas considered secondary to silodosin-induced hyperprolactinemia. In two US phase III 
clinical studies serum prolactin levels were unaffected after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Post-marketing  data  in  Japan  indicated  occurrence  of  impaired  hepatic  function  and  jaundice,  since 
some cases suspected of being related to silodosin have been reported. In the EU/US studies the only 
serious case of hepatitis was considered as not related (food poisoning) and resolved. Overall, there is 
no evidence to indicate that silodosin treatment may cause impaired hepatic function or jaundice. 
In  addition  to  standard  clinical  chemistry  parameters,  the  following  laboratory  parameters  were 
analysed:  PSA,  HbA1C,  TSH,  total  T3,  free  T4,  and  total  T4.  Although  in  the  integrated  safety 
population, increased PSA was reported as treatment-emergent adverse event in 23 patients (1.5%), no 
significant change in serum PSA could be expected on silodosin therapy.  
•  Safety in special populations 
Age 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  by  age  was  reviewed  and  no  clinically  relevant  difference  was 
observed  for  patients  of  different  ages.  Overall,  silodosin  appears to  be  well tolerated in  the  elderly 
and  the  incidence  of  the  most  common  adverse  reaction  (retrograde  ejaculation)  is  lower  than  in 
younger patients. There is no evidence of an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension in patients over 
65  years.  For  the  subgroup  over  75  years  the  incidence  of  orthostatic  hypotension  in  the  silodosin 
group  was  slightly  higher  than  in  younger  patients,  however  there  is  no  statistical  evidence  of  an 
increased risk. 
Race 
The majority (94.6%) of patients enrolled in the EU/US phase II and III studies were Caucasians. No 
integrated  analyses  of  treatment-related  adverse  events  by  race  have  been  conducted  as  the  low 
percentage of patients of the other races would not provide meaningful data. However, in individual 
studies performed in the US, safety data was analysed by race and no differences were observed.

Renal Insufficiency 
A  large  number  of  patients  (487/1,581)  in  the  overall  silodosin  safety  population  had  mild  renal 
impairment (CrCl of 80-50 ml/min). A high number of patients with mild renal impairment were also 
included  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  (273  for  silodosin  and  204  for  placebo).  Mild  renal 
impairment  does  not  confer  additional  safety  risks,  such  as  increased  dizziness  and  orthostatic 
hypotension,  during  silodosin  therapy  in  comparison  with  patients  with  normal  renal  function.  No 
warning  or  dose  adjustment  is  therefore  required  in  these  patients.  The  experience  in  patients  with 
moderate renal impairment (n=35) and even more in severe renal impairment (n=1) is too limited to 
draw firm conclusions. The incidence of dizziness (2/35, 5.7%) was apparently increased in patients 
with moderate renal impairment in comparison with normal patients (20/955, 2.1%) or with patients 
with mild renal impairment (10/487, 2.1%). Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 2/35 (5.7%) patients 
with  moderate  renal  impairment  as  compared  with  2/487  (0.4%)  with  mild  renal  impairment  and 
15/955 (1.6%) with normal renal function. A starting dose of 4 mg is recommended for patients with 
moderate  renal  impairment,  while  the  use  of  the  product  is  not  recommended  in  severe  renal 
impairment. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Hepatic Insufficiency 
On the basis of the clinical pharmacology study investigating the effects of hepatic dysfunction (Study 
SI05010), no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The 
effects  of  severe  hepatic  insufficiency  were  not  evaluated.  The  use  of  silodosin  in  these  patients  is 
therefore presently not recommended. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Antihypertensive medication 
A  large  number  of  patients  received  concomitant  treatment  with  antihypertensive  agents  during  the 
clinical development programme. In particular, 24% of the patients were administered drugs acting on 
the renin-angiotensin system, 13% beta-blocking agents, 8.7% calcium antagonists and 7.5% diuretics. 
Only  individual  patients  were  treated  concomitantly  with  α-adrenoceptor  antagonists  in  violation  of 
the protocol (2 with doxazosin, 1 with prazosin, 1 with terazosin). 
A comparison of the safety data from patients on concomitant antihypertensive therapy and those not 
receiving  the  antihypertensive  treatment  indicate  no  increase  in  risk  of  orthostatic  hypotension  in 
patients  taking  antihypertensive  agents.  Dizziness  was  slightly  more  frequent  in  patients  taking 
antihypertensive  medication,  while  there  is  no  increase  in  the  number  of  patients  complaining  of 
vertigo, fatigue or asthenia. Appropriate guidance regarding concomitant use of antihypertensives has 
been  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  concomitant  use  of  an  α-adrenoceptor  antagonist  is  not 
recommended, since clinically relevant interactions might occur. 
PD interactions with PDE5 inhibitors 
Results from the pharmacodynamic interaction study with silodosin and sildenafil, tadalafil, or placebo 
(Study  SI06002)  suggest  a  minimal  risk  of  orthostatic  hypotension  due  to  and  interaction  between 
PDE5  inhibitors  and  silodosin.  Data  from  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  show  that  orthostatic 
hypotension occurs more frequently in patients on PDE5 inhibitors both in the silodosin group (3/58, 
5.2%) and in the placebo group (2/56, 3.6%) in comparison with patients not on concomitant treatment 
(8/873,  0.9%  with  silodosin  and  5/677,  0.7%  with  placebo).  Overall,  orthostatic  hypotension  was 
reported by 4/114 patients treated with silodosin and PDE-5 inhibitors (3.5%), as compared to 16/1467 
(1.1%) not on concomitant medications. Patients taking silodosin concomitantly with PDE-5 inhibitors 
should  be  monitored  for  possible  adverse  reactions.  This  information  is  adequately  reflected  in  the 
SmPC. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No clinical investigations have been performed examining silodosin potential to affect response time 
or coordination. Based on the clinical study results, as well as experience with other selective agents 
from  this  pharmacologic  class,  the  likelihood  of  a  significant  effect  is  considered  low.  However, 
patients  should  be  instructed  about  the  possible  occurrence  of  symptoms  related  to  postural 
Page 49 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypotension (such  as  dizziness)  and  should  be  cautioned  about  driving  or  operating  machinery  until 
they know how silodosin will affect them. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the double-blind phase of the US and EU studies, treatment-related adverse events leading to 
study discontinuation occurred in 40/931 (4.3%) patients treated with silodosin, as compared to 14/733 
(1.9%) patients on placebo. Taking into consideration also the data collected in the open label long-
term extension phase of the studies, overall 148/1581 (9.4%) subjects discontinued the study due to 
AEs  during  silodosin  therapy.  The  most  frequent  cause  of  study  discontinuation  was  retrograde 
ejaculation (62/1581, 3.9%). Dizziness was a cause of discontinuation in 8/1581 patients (0.5%) and 
orthostatic hypotension in 3/1581 patients (0.2%). 
•  Post marketing experience 
The international birth date of silodosin is January 23, 2006. Silodosin was first approved in Japan and 
has  been  launched  there  in  May  2006.  The  recommended  dose  in  Japan  is  4  mg  twice  daily  after 
breakfast  and  the  evening  meal  that  can  be  reduced  to  2  mg  twice  daily  according  to  the  patient’s 
conditions. Based on cumulative sales of silodosin (Urief) in Japan from launch (May 2006) until 30th 
January 2008, approximately 344,000 patients have been exposed to silodosin during this period. Up 
to January 30, 2008, a total of 2,672 adverse reactions have been reported in Japan, including 98 cases 
assessed as serious, 2,570 as non-serious and 4 as unknown. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions have been abnormal ejaculation, diarrhoea, dizziness, 
nasal congestion and thirst. The large majority of those events were assessed as non serious. 
The Company Safety Information was updated with the undesirable effects syncope, unconsciousness, 
and warnings/precautions including a class statement on IFIS, jaundice and hepatic function disorder. 
In the drug usage survey presently ongoing in Japan no special safety issues have been identified. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 3049 subjects received at least one dose of silodosin. A total of 1581 patients were exposed 
to  the  daily  doses  of  8  mg  silodosin  and  were  included  in  the  integrated  summary  of  safety;  961 
(62.4%)  patients  were  exposed  for  at  least  6  months  and  384  patients  (24.9%)  were  exposed  for  at 
least 12 months. In addition, studies in Japan provided safety information on 873 patients and clinical 
pharmacology studies on 595 subjects.  
In the integrated summary of safety the most common adverse events on silodosin treatment was an 
event coded as ‘retrograde ejaculation’ (23.6%). In the active-controlled study IT-CL-0215 retrograde 
ejaculation  was  reported  by  a  significantly  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  silodosin  treatment 
group (14.2%) compared with the tamsulosin treatment group (2.1%) and the placebo group (1.1%). It 
was  the  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  in  this  study  and  in  the  overall  safety  population  of 
patients treated with silodosin (62/1581, 3.9%). The CHMP has expressed concern about the high rate 
of ejaculatory disorders in patients treated with silodosin and asked the applicant to discuss further this 
issue and other related adverse events as well as their impact on patients’ sexual life. In their responses 
the applicant emphasised that retrograde ejaculation (i.e. orgasm with reduced or no semen) is due to 
the  potent  and  selective  alpha1A-adrenoreceptor  antagonism  of  the  drug,  with  consequent  marked 
smooth muscle relaxation in the lower urinary and genital tract. There was no evidence for damage to 
the urological system and the effect of silodosin on ejaculation was transitory and reversible without 
permanent effects on fertility. Retrograde ejaculation was not perceived as bothersome by the majority 
of  patients.  In  the  clinical  study  programme  conducted  with  silodosin  this  event  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation  in  a  minority  of  patients  (1.3%  on  silodosin  arm  compared  to  0.3%  on  tamsulosin 
arm). Relevant warnings have been included in product labelling. To further investigate the psycho-
sexological  impact  of  the  ejaculatory  disturbances,  a  detailed  PSUR  review  of  adverse  events 
regarding sexual life will be performed as a follow-up measure (FUM).  
Other adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients were dizziness (2.1%), nasal congestion (1.3%), 
headache  (1.3%)  and  diarrhoea  (1.0%).  Orthostatic  hypotension  was  reported  by  20/1581  patients 
(1.3%), with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo (1.2% vs. 1.0%) in placebo-controlled 
studies. Comparative data with tamsulosin revealed that headache was reported by a somewhat lower 
Page 50 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentage of subjects in the silodosin group (2.9%) compared with the tamsulosin group (5.5%) and 
the placebo group (4.7%). The occurrence of related TEAE was not associated with onset or duration 
of treatment. Five deaths occurred during the clinical development programme. They were considered 
as  not  related  by  the  investigators.  In  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  SAEs  occurred  in  10/931 
(1.1%)  with  silodosin  and  8/733  (1.1%)  with  placebo.  The  “Intraoperative  Floppy  Iris  Syndrome” 
(IFIS, a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery predominantly in 
some patients on or previously treated with alpha-blocking agents. IFIS is considered an identified risk 
and  discussed  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  Appropriate  guidance  has  been  also  included  in  the 
SmPC.  Moreover,  a  detailed  PSUR  review  of  cases  of  IFIS,  orthostatic  hypotension,  syncope  and 
photosensitivity reactions will be performed as a FUM.  
Silodosin did not appear to prolong the QT interval. 
Silodosin  did  not  appear  to  have  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  laboratory  values  tested,  including 
serum PSA.  
The  frequency  and  profile  of  adverse  events  was  similar  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  and 
mild renal impairment and in patients with < 65 and > 65 years of age. Concomitant disease such as 
hypertension  did  not  have  significant  effect  on  the  safety  profile.  There  is  a  limited  experience  of 
silodosin use in patients with moderate renal failure and no experience in patients with severe renal 
failure  and  hepatic  failure.  This  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  a  detailed  PSUR 
review of the use of the 4 mg dose in moderate/severe renal impairment will be performed as a FUM. 
Post-marketing experience with silodosin 4 mg bid from Japan has not identified any additional risks.  
In conclusion, safety profile of silodosin can be considered similar to other alpha1-adrenoreceptor 
antagonists, except fort the higher frequency of retrograde ejaculation.

SmPC section 4.4  
IFIS (a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some 
patients on α1-blockers or previously treated with α1-blockers. This may lead to increased 
procedural complications during the operation.  
The initiation of therapy with Urorec is not recommended in patients for whom cataract surgery is 
scheduled. Discontinuing treatment with an α1-blocker 1-2 weeks prior to cataract surgery has 
been recommended, but the benefit and duration of stopping the therapy prior to cataract surgery 
has not yet been established.  
During pre-operative assessment, eye surgeons and ophthalmic teams should consider whether 
patients scheduled for cataract surgery are being or have been treated with Urorec, in order to 
ensure that appropriate measures will be in place to manage IFIS during surgery.

Orthostatic effects 
The incidence of orthostatic effects with Urorec is very low. However, a reduction in blood 
pressure can occur in individual patients, leading in rare cases to syncope. At the first signs of 
orthostatic hypotension (such as postural dizziness), the patient should sit or lie down until the 
symptoms have disappeared. In patients with orthostatic hypotension, treatment with Urorec is not 
recommended.

A starting dose of 4 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CLCR ≥30 to <50 ml/min), which may be increased to 8 mg once daily after one week of 
treatment, depending on the individual patient’s response. The use in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CLCR <30 ml/min) is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

presence of carcinoma of the prostate. Digital rectal examination and, when necessary, 
determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at 
regular intervals afterwards.

Fertility 
In clinical studies, the occurrence of ejaculation with reduced or no semen has been observed 
during treatment with Urorec (see section 4.8), due to the pharmacodynamic properties of 
silodosin. Before starting treatment, the patient should be informed that this effect may occur, 
temporarily affecting male fertility.

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
There are no unresolved quality issues which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The toxicological profile of silodosin was assessed in a sufficient set of studies which appropriately 
described the main characteristics of the product relevant for the proposed conditions of use. The main 
findings observed in the repeat-dose toxicology studies were related to enzymatic induction in the dog 
liver (fatty degeneration), increased prolactin production (changes in mammary gland and sex organs 
in female rats), stress (atrophy of the thymus and lipid accumulation), were considered to be a high 
dose phenomenon (atrophy of the fundic gland and oedema of stomach submucosa in rats and dogs) or 
irrelevant in terms of human safety (degeneration of the seminiferous tubular epithelium and delayed 
maturation  of  male  genital  organs  in  dogs).  Following  the  detailed  discussion  on  silodosin  cardiac 
safety the CHMP has acknowledged that the product has little effect on the repolarisation process of 
the heart and is unlikely to cause a significant decrease in blood pressure. Similarly, the deposition of 
lipofuscin-like  materials  observed  in  dog  hepatocytes  was  deemed  not  to  be  relevant  to  man  due  to 
minimal  severity  and  absence  of  other  histopathological  findings  and  blood  biochemical  changes 
suggestive  of  hepatotoxicity.  Silodosin  was  considered  not  to  be  genotoxic  in  a  standard  battery  of 
including  mammary  adenocarcinomas, 
tests.  Neoplastic 
adenoacanthoma,  pituitary  adenomas  appeared  to  be  related to  the  increased  prolactin  production  as 
discussed  in  detail  in  responses  to  the  CHMP  questions.  In  male  rats,  an  increase  in  incidence  of 
thyroid  follicular  cell  tumours  was  noted.  The  discussion  provided  by  the  applicant  following  the 
CHMP request indicated that these tumours were related to increased UDP-GT levels and disturbances 
of the T3 and T4 metabolism specific to rodents. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or 
rabbits.  Slight,  but  reversible,  decreases  in  sperm  counts  and  mobility  were  noted  in  male  rats.  In 
female rats, silodosin was associated with alterations in the oestrus cycle at high doses, but not with 
in  female  mice, 
lesions  observed 
Page 56 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infertility, although decreased fertility and implantation rates were also reported. In vitro and in vivo 
phototoxicity studies suggest that silodosin may have  the ability to minimally increase sensitivity to 
sunlight. 
All toxicology findings have been adequately reflected in the SmPC and risk management programme 
for silodosin. 
Efficacy 
The efficacy of silodosin was assessed in three main multicentre efficacy studies of 12-week duration 
conducted  according  to  the  classical  randomised,  double-blinded,  controlled  design.  Two  studies, 
SI04009  and  SI04010,  were  conducted  in  the  US  and  one  (IT-CL-0215)  in  Europe.  The  European 
study was an active- and placebo-controlled trial. In all main studies 4-week single-blind placebo run-
in period preceded 12 weeks of therapy with silodosin, placebo or active control (study IT-CL-0215). 
In the main studies 837 patients received silodosin, 376 active control (tamsulosin) and 642 placebo. 
The  average  age  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  studies  was  65  years.  In  all  studies  the  final  marketing 
formulation of the product was used.  
The primary endpoint used across the studies was a change from baseline in the total score of IPSS 
(International Prostate Symptom Score, Questions 1-7 referring to symptoms) as measured at week 12. 
A  number  of  secondary  endpoints  were  used  including  change  in  the  maximum  urine  flow  rate 
(Qmax), irritative and obstructive symptoms subscales of the IPSS and QOL. The safety of silodosin 
compared to placebo based on adverse events, vital signs (including orthostatic test), ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests, and physical exams was also assessed. Additional secondary endpoints in the IT-CL 
0215 study included percentage of respondents to IPSS, defined as percentage of patients with ≥ 25% 
decrease in IPSS compared to baseline, and percentage of respondents to Qmax, defined as percentage 
of  patients  with  ≥  30%  increase  in  Qmax  compared  to  baseline.  The  CHMP  has  considered  the 
primary and secondary endpoints as appropriate given that the assessment of symptom severity is the 
most important outcome measure from the patient’s perspective. 
The  treatment  with  silodosin  was  shown  to  be  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  the  change  from 
baseline  to  week  12  in  the  total  IPSS  score  in  all  main  studies  and  non-inferior  to  treatment  with 
tamsulosin in the European study.  
Exclusion from randomisation of patients eligible at screening but demonstrating a significant 
The CHMP has discussed the following efficacy aspects of the main studies: 
a) 
placebo response after a 4-week placebo run-in and its impact on the treatment effect.  
The post-hoc analysis including also placebo responders defined as subjects showing a decrease in the 
total  IPSS  score  >25%  in  the  run-in  period  did  not  change  the  original  conclusions  of  silodosin 
superiority  versus  placebo  and  non  inferiority  versus  tamsulosin.  Additional  231  subjects  in  the  US 
studies  (125  and  106  in  SI04009  and  SI04010,  respectively)  and  31  in  the  European  study  were 
included in the post-hoc analysis. The reasons for not including the remaining subjects were discussed 
sufficiently  and  acknowledged  by  the  CHMP.  Moreover,  a  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis  conducted 
separately in patients with moderate or severe symptoms (IPSS total score < 20 or ≥ 20, respectively) 
in order to evaluate the efficacy of silodosin with respect to the severity of the condition and justify the 
cut-off of ≥13 in the IPSS score as an inclusion criterion was also performed. The results confirmed 
that the treatment effect observed both in patients with moderate and severe condition was in the same 
order of magnitude in as in the whole patient population. 
b) 
Choice of the clinically important difference (-2 points) and the non-inferiority margin (-1.5 
points) and the clinical relevance of the treatment effect (-2.3 to -2.8 points change in the IPSS score 
on the silodosin arm) for study IT-CL-0215.  
The literature data review submitted in response to the CHMP question demonstrated that the change 
in  the  IPPS  score  from  baseline  observed  in  silodosin  arms  was  similar  to  those  reported  for  other 
alpha-blockers providing justification for the non-inferiority margin. Similarly, the value of -2 points 
in  the  IPSS  total  score  was  considered  as  clinically  relevant  based  upon  previous  clinical  evidence 
showing that the minimum level of perception of improvement among men with moderate symptoms 
was set at -1.9 points. In addition, recently published meta-analysis on alpha-blockers also showed that 
Page 57 of 60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  difference  from  placebo  in  American  Urological  Association  Symptom  Index/International 
Prostate  Symptom  Score  was  -1.92  points  (superiority  margin).  Hence,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
treatment effect observed in the European study was similar to that observed in other trials with alpha-
blocking agents. 
Duration of the main efficacy studies of 12 weeks.  
c) 
The CHMP acknowledged that in previous clinical studies with drugs approved for BPH, the duration 
of main efficacy studies has been 12 weeks due to the fact that alpha-blocking agents show immediate 
therapeutic benefits. Moreover, no regulatory guideline exists on the investigation of products for the 
treatment of BPH. The long-term benefits of silodosin have been shown in two open-label long-term 
studies in more than 900 patients treated for at least 6 months, and in more than 300 patients treated 
for  12  months.  In  both  studies  the  treatment  effect  appeared  soon  after  treatment  initiation  and  was 
maintained  over  time.  In  acknowledging  the  response,  the  CHMP  underlined  the  limited  validity 
related to an uncontrolled design of the open-label extension trials.  
Safety 
A total of 3049 subjects received at least one dose of silodosin. A total of 1581 patients were exposed 
to  the  daily  doses  of  8  mg  silodosin  and  were  included  in  the  integrated  summary  of  safety;  961 
(62.4%)  patients  were  exposed  for  at  least  6  months  and  384  patients  (24.9%)  were  exposed  for  at 
least 12 months. In addition, studies in Japan provided safety information on 873 patients and clinical 
pharmacology  studies  on  595  subjects.  Size  of  the  safety  population,  both  in  terms  of  number  of 
patients  and  duration  of  treatment,  meets  requirements  in  the  ICH  Topic  E1  “Population  Exposure: 
The  Extent  of  Population  Exposure  to  Assess  Clinical  Safety”.  Demographic  characteristics  of  the 
integrated safety population are representative of the target patient population. 
In  the  integrated  summary  of  safety  the  most  common  adverse  event  on  silodosin  treatment  was  an 
event coded as ‘retrograde ejaculation’ (23.6%). In the active-controlled study IT-CL-0215 retrograde 
ejaculation  was  reported  by  a  significantly  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  silodosin  treatment 
group (14.2%) compared with the tamsulosin treatment group (2.1%) and the placebo group (1.1%). It 
was  also  the  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  in  this  study  and  in  the  overall  safety  population 
(3.9%).  The  CHMP  has  expressed  concern  about  the  high  rate  of  ejaculatory  disorders  in  patients 
treated  with  silodosin and asked  the applicant to  discuss  further this  issue and other  related adverse 
events as well as their impact on patients’ sexual life. In their responses the applicant emphasised that 
retrograde ejaculation (i.e. orgasm with reduced or no semen) is due to the potent and selective alpha 
1A-adrenoreceptor antagonism of the drug, with consequent marked smooth muscle relaxation in the 
lower urinary and genital tract. There was no evidence for damage to the urological system and the 
effect of silodosin on ejaculation was transitory and reversible without permanent effects on fertility. 
Retrograde  ejaculation  was  not  perceived  as  bothersome  by  the  majority  of  patients.  In  the  clinical 
study programme conducted with silodosin this event lead to treatment discontinuation in a minority 
of  patients  (1.3%  on  silodosin  arm  compared  to  0.3%  on  tamsulosin  arm).  Relevant  warnings  have 
been included in the product labelling.  
To  further  investigate  the  psycho-sexological  impact  of  the  ejaculatory  disturbances  a  close 
monitoring  and  review  in  PSURs  of  adverse  events  regarding  sexual  life  is  foreseen  as  a  follow-up 
measure.  
Other adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients were dizziness, nasal congestion, headache and 
diarrhoea. Orthostatic hypotension was reported by 1.3% of patients with an incidence similar to that 
observed with placebo (1.2% vs. 1.0%) in placebo-controlled studies. The occurrence of related TEAE 
was  not  associated  with  onset  or  duration  of  treatment.  Five  deaths  occurred  during  the  clinical 
development  programme.  They  were  considered  as  not  related  by  the  investigators.  In  placebo-
controlled clinical trials SAEs occurred in 1.1% with silodosin 1.1% with placebo. The “Intraoperative 
Floppy  Iris  Syndrome”  (IFIS,  a  variant  of  small  pupil  syndrome)  has  been  observed  during  cataract 
surgery predominantly in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-blocking agents. IFIS is 
considered an identified risk and discussed in the Risk Management Plan. Appropriate guidance has 
been also included in the SmPC.

Silodosin  did  not  appear  to  prolong  the  QT  interval.  Silodosin  did  not  appear  to  have  clinically 
meaningful  effect  on  laboratory  values  tested,  including  serum  PSA.  The  frequency  and  profile  of 
adverse events  was similar  in  patients  with  normal  renal function  and  mild renal  impairment  and in 
patients  with  <  65  and  >  65  years  of  age.  Concomitant  disease  such  as  hypertension  did  not  have 
significant effect on the safety profile. There is a limited experience of silodosin use in patients with 
moderate renal failure and no experience in patients with severe renal failure and hepatic failure. This 
is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Post-marketing experience with silodosin 4 mg bid from Japan has not identified any additional risks.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 2.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The applicant has submitted results from the user testing of package leaflet which was performed in 
English. The results of the test were found to be acceptable. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The  treatment  with  silodosin  was  shown  to  be  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  the  change  from 
baseline to week 12 in the total IPSS score (the overall treatment effect -2.3 to -2.8) in all main studies 
and  non-inferior  to  treatment  with  tamsulosin  in  the  European  study.  Additional  analyses  including 
also  placebo  responders  did  not  change  the  original  conclusions  and  confirmed  that  the  treatment 
effect  was  significant  both  in  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  condition  with  slightly  more 
pronounced effect in severe patients.  
Clinical relevance of the observed absolute change in the IPSS score is difficult to establish. The IPSS 
score was used for the primary efficacy assessment. Although it is the most widely used questionnaire 
in clinical trials for BPH, it is not specific to BPH, but rather measures LUTS. The score has not been 
fully validated to meet regulatory requirements. 
Interpretation of study results is further hampered by the use of enriched population. 
The  clinical  development  programme  of  silodosin  has  been  similar  to  that  of  other  alpha-blockers 
approved for the treatment of BPH. The literature review of studies conducted with alpha-blockers for 
the treatment of BPH has shown similar changes in the IPSS score as those observed with silodosin. 
Given that the results obtained for silodosin were very similar to those reported previously for other 
alpha-blockers  and  were  confirmed  in  the  tamsulosin-controlled  EU  study  IT-CL0215,  it  can  be 
concluded that the efficacy of silodosin has been demonstrated. 
The safety profile of silodosin is comparable to that of other products in this therapeutic class (alpha 1-
adrenoreceptor  antagonists),  except  for  the  frequency  of  ejaculatory  disorders.  In  a  12-week 
comparative  trial,  14%  of  patients  on  silodosin  arm  compared  to  2%  of  patients  on  tamsulosin  arm 
reported retrograde ejaculation. However, retrograde ejaculation was not perceived as bothersome by 
the  majority  of  patients.  There  is  no  evidence  for  damage  to  the  urological  system;  the  effect  of 
silodosin  on  ejaculation  is  transitory  and  reversible  without  permanent  effects  on  fertility.  Other 
aspects of silodosin safety profile seem to be similar to those reported for other alpha 1-adrenoreceptor 
antagonists. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
the  following  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required:  Direct  Healthcare 
Professional  Communication  (DHPC)  on  the  association  of  silodosin  with  Intraoperative 
Floppy  Iris  Syndrome  (IFIS),  a flow-chart  describing  the  management  of  patients  scheduled 
for cataract surgery, an educational programme on the prevention and management of IFIS.

Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Urorec in the treatment of the signs and symptoms 
of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the 
marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application rests mainly on the safety and efficacy data relevant to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
in adults that were submitted and fully assessed under EMEA/H/C/594/II/126. The current application 
includes very limited new clinical data from two studies of PrEP in the target population that were not 
sponsored by the MAH: 
•  ATN-113, which investigated the use of Truvada (TVD) for PrEP in HIV-uninfected male 
adolescents aged 15 to 17 years with a history of having sex with other males (presented publicly 
in 2016)   
•  ATN-110, which investigated the use of TVD for PrEP in HIV-uninfected MSM aged 18-22 years 
(published in 2017) 
HIV-1 seroconversion rates and limited PK data are available from these two studies. Available safety 
information was provided for studies ATN 110 and ATN-113. Additional PK, safety and efficacy data on 
treatment of HIV-infected adolescents come from the Stribild (STB) Study GS-US-236-0112. 
The dossier contains several Gilead-sponsored studies that were already assessed as part of numerous 
prior applications and which have supported the use of FTC, TDF and TVD for the treatment of HIV in 
children and adults. The efficacy data from these studies are not strictly relevant to use of TVD for PrEP. 
The PK data and safety data pertaining to daily dosing of HIV-1-infected adolescents with FTC, TDF or 
STB are of some relevance to the current application. However, the PrEP usage will be in the HIV-1 
uninfected population and will not involve additional anti-retroviral agents that may have influenced the 
PK and safety profiles described in the treatment studies. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP 
since TVD is already approved for the treatment of adolescents from age 12 years using a once daily 
dose. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The two ATN trials were conducted in accordance with operative FDA regulations and usual GCP 
requirements.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Truvada is authorised for the treatment of HIV-1 in adolescents from the age of 12 years and 35 kg 
(opinion reached in II/131). The pharmacokinetic data to support that usage have been assessed in 
various assessment reports. Since PrEP uses the same once daily dose of Truvada, all of the relevant data 
in HIV-1 infected adolescents were already assessed with the exception of full data from the STB study in 
adolescents GS-US-236-0112 and some data on TFV-DP in dried blood spots in ATN 110 and 113.  
The dossier includes a Summary of Pharmacokinetics and an Extrapolation Report which: 
•  Compares the FTC and TFV exposures achieved in adults and in adolescents 12 to < 18 years of 
age 
•  Discusses extrapolation of efficacy data for PrEP in adults to adolescents based on comparable PK 
The report presents data for plasma FTC, TDF and STB from HIV-infected and uninfected adults and 
infected adolescents. Some TFV-DP data in dried blood spots are available from ATN 110 and 113.

To support a conclusion on similar PK between HIV-infected and uninfected adolescents and adults the 
following data are summarised: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
FTC and TFV exposures following multiple doses of FTC, TDF or STB in HIV-infected adolescents 
and HIV-infected adults 
TFV-DP exposures following treatment with TVD in HIV-uninfected young adults 
FTC and TFV exposures in HIV-infected and uninfected adults 
FTC and TFV exposures following treatment with TVD in body fluids and mucosal tissues in HIV-
uninfected adults 
Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the FTC studies in paediatric subjects (FTC-202, FTC-211 and 
FTC-203) were combined. FTC was given at 6 mg/kg once daily up to 40 kg, after which subjects received 
a 200 mg capsule or 240 mg oral solution once daily. The mean and CV% values for the principal PK 
parameters for 27 adolescents aged 13-17 years are shown in Table 4.

Parameters at Steady-State for Adolescents (All Subjects) 
a One subject  (study FTC-203) was excluded from the summary statistics. 
The mean AUCtau values in adolescents were in the range seen for HIV-infected adults as shown in Figure

Plasma TFV levels are available for 8 HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12-16 years who received TDF (300 
mg QD without regard to food) plus a background ARV regimen for at least 4 weeks in Study GS-US-
104-0321. Serial plasma sampling over a 12-hour period after dosing provided the concentration data 
for steady state PK analysis. A pre-dose concentration, where available, was used as a surrogate for the 
24-hour concentration. 
Comparison of the plasma TFV data in adolescents in this study with historical data in HIV-1 infected 
adults under steady-state conditions revealed slightly higher TFV exposures despite a shorter t 1/2.

Pharmacokinetic data for FTC and TFV are available for 14 adolescent subjects who received STB in the 
PK Analysis Set of Study GS-US-236-0112. Blood samples were collected on Day 10 at pre-dose (0 hours) 
and at 2, 4, 4.5, 5, 8 and 12 hours post-dose.  
FTC exposures were in the range of those observed in adults in historical studies. Cross-study comparison 
showed that the means were slightly higher in adolescents but the 90% CIs of the GLSM ratios for 
AUCtau, Cmax and Ctrough were contained within 70% to 143%.

c The predose trough concentration (Ctrough) represents Ctau. 
The mean TFV AUCtau and Cmax in adolescents were higher (approximately 31% to 37%) compared with 
adults receiving STB in historical studies but they were in the range of those observed in adults taking 
TDF-containing boosted-protease inhibitor regimens.  
For example, among adult subjects taking ATV/r + FTC/TDF the mean (%CV) AUCtau for TFV was 3944.0 
(29.7) ng*h/mL (Study GS-US-216-0114), among adults taking LPV/r +TDF the median (range) AUCtau 
for TFV was 4199 (2031 to 6362) ng*h/mL and among adults taking DRV/r + TDF the mean (%CV) 
AUCtau for TFV was 4633 (15.9) ng*h/mL. 
Regarding PK differences between HIV-1 uninfected and infected adults, FTC PK parameter estimates 
following oral administration are characterised by relatively low inter-subject variability and consistent PK 
data regardless of HIV-1 status. The lack of a difference may reflect the oral bioavailability of FTC and the 
fact that it is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine (~65 to 70% of an oral dose) with only ~13% 
being metabolised.

There were no significant differences in the PK of TFV between HIV-1 infected patients (n = 17) and 
uninfected subjects (n = 36) (p = 0.1538) in Studies GS-97-901, GS-99-907 and GS-00-914 with the 
exception of terminal elimination half-life (p = 0.0001), which was ascribed to a shorter duration of blood 
sampling post-dose in HIV-1 infected patients vs. healthy subjects (24 hours and 48 hours, respectively).

In the publication from Patterson (2011), concerning administration of a single oral dose of TVD to 15 
healthy male and female individuals, the concentrations of TFV and FTC and their respective active 
metabolites TFV-DP and FTC-TP varied according to the mucosal tissue type (see below). The TFV 
concentration in rectal mucosa was greater and persisted for longer than the FTC concentration. The FTC 
concentration in vaginal and cervical tissue was greater than the TFV concentration. TFV, TFV-DP and FTC 
could be quantified in mucosal tissues for 10 to 14 days, whereas FTC-TP was only detected for up to 2 
days. The applicant’s summary states that the concentrations of ART achieved in female genital tract 
tissue suggest that standard TDF/FTC oral dosing may not be sufficient to prevent HIV acquisition. It also 
states that prevention of vaginal acquisition of HIV may require a stronger barrier to infection than that 
provided by oral dosing with TVD.

Pharmacokinetic data are available for TFV-DP in HIV-uninfected young adults 18 to 22 years of age in 
Study ATN 110 who received TVD QD for PrEP. The study enrolled 200 subjects and 135 completed 48 
weeks of treatment. Pharmacokinetic data for plasma TFV and FTC are not reported. Levels of TFV-DP in 
dried blood spots (DBS) that were ≥ 700 fmol/punch were reported for between 50% and 60% of 
subjects through Week 12. Only 35% of subjects had this TFV-DP level by Week 48. Participants who 
reported unprotected intercourse had higher levels of TFV-DP.

47 completed 48 weeks of treatment. Plasma TFV and FTC data are not available. TFV-DP levels in DBS 
were ≥ 700 fmol/punch (indicator of dosing for ≥ 4/7 days/week) for 52% to 60% of subjects through 
Week 12 but in only ~23-31% from Weeks 24-48, indicating a marked drop in treatment adherence.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The exposure to FTC at steady state in 27 HIV-infected adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) dosed with 6 
mg/kg or the adult dose (or equivalent) was similar to that seen in HIV-infected adults receiving a dose of 
200 mg once daily. 
The exposure to TFV after dosing with 300 mg TDF QD to steady state in 8 HIV-infected adolescents 
(aged 12 to 16 years) was higher than that seen in similarly dosed HIV-infected adults. 
In 14 HIV-infected adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) receiving STB once daily, the exposure to FTC was 
~20% higher and the exposure to TFV was ~40% higher than that in HIV-infected adults treated with 
STB. The exposures to TFV in the adolescents were within the range described for adults who received 
TDF with various ritonavir-boosted PIs in prior studies.  
Plasma exposures to FTC and TFV are similar in HIV-infected and uninfected adults.  
Plasma exposures to FTC and TFV were not determined in uninfected adolescents who received 200 mg 
FTC and 300 mg TDF QD. Based on the comparisons made above, it is reasonably expected that plasma 
exposures to FTC and TFV in HIV-uninfected adolescents will be slightly higher than those in uninfected 
adults at the same level of adherence to TVD for PrEP. This observation underlines the potential safety 
concerns regarding TFV effects on renal function and bone formation and maintenance, especially in 
adolescents who are pre-pubertal (noting that the applicant proposes use for PrEP from the age of 12 
years) and in those who have not completed their growth spurt. In this regard, it should be noted that 
the MAH has not addressed the potential that plasma exposures may differ between genders, possibly 
being even greater in post-pubertal females compared to post-pubertal males. There are inadequate PK 
data in male and female adolescents to assess this matter. The safety implications of the higher 
exposures to FTC and TFV in adolescents vs. adults are discussed in the safety section. 
Although plasma exposures to TFV and FTC are expected to be higher in adolescents than adults at the 
same level of adherence, the few published data that are available strongly suggest that adherence to 
TVD QD for PrEP will very likely be even less in adolescents than in adults, even when the comparison is 
made between 15-17 year-olds and 18-22 year-olds in two studies conducted by the same group of 
investigators in the US. This matter is discussed further in the clinical efficacy section.  
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 17/55 
 
  
  
  
 
 
The published data on penetration of FTC and TFV to the genital tract and rectum on dosing 15 adults 
with TVD QD for 14 days were discussed in II/126. Also considered at that time was a publication by 
Cottrell et al. (2016) describing a PK/PD model based on mucosal tissue concentrations in 47 healthy 
women. Overall, there is a suggestion from publications that adherence may be even more critical for 
women at risk of HIV-1 acquisition via the genital tract compared to men at risk from rectal transmission. 
The two published studies ATN 100 and 113 did not enrol any females. Data reported to the MAH indicate 
that there was no gender difference in poor adherence observed in the CHAMPS study conducted in 148 
teenagers, including 98 females. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The plasma exposures to FTC and especially to TFV are expected to be higher in adolescents than in 
adults at the same level of adherence. It is possible that exposures could be even higher in female 
adolescents than male adolescents after completion of the growth spurt. However, the actual plasma 
exposures in adolescents who are prescribed TVD for PrEP may be lower than in adults due to poor 
adherence. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Since the PrEP data in adults were fully assessed in EMEA/H/C/594/II/126 this section will focus on the 
efficacy data available on FTC, TDF and STB for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adolescents and the very 
limited data available on use of TVD for PrEP in males aged 15-17 years and aged 18-22 years.  
Treatment of HIV-1 in adolescents 
FTC in ART-Naive and ART-Experienced HIV-Infected Adolescents 
Analysis by age group across the study populations of FTC-203 and FTC-211 showed similar antiviral 
response rates in the different age groups. In the 13-17 years age group 17/18 (94%) achieved and 
maintained suppression at ≤ 400 copies/mL at Week 48 and 14/18 (78%) had < 50 copies/mL.  
Table 10.  Summary of Primary Efficacy Endpoint at Week 48 by Age Group: Studies FTC-203 and FTC-
211 (ITT Population) 
a Two subjects are censored, because they had no Week 48 data and were below the LLOQ (≤ 50 copies/mL) at the visits immediately prior to and after Week 
48.

The mean absolute CD4 cell count increase from baseline to Week 48 ranged from 165 to 273 cells/mm3 
across the paediatric studies.  
Table 11.  Summary of Change in Absolute and Percent CD4 Cell Counts from Baseline to Week 48 by 
FTC Studies and ART Experience 
These data were not analyzed by ART stratum. Because all but one patient was ART-naive, overall data are presented in the ART-naive column. 
After a median duration of follow up of 96 weeks virologic failure had occurred in 16/132 patients 
(12.1%), of which 3 were adolescents (aged 12 – 17 years). Genotypic testing of TLOVR-defined virologic 
failures confirmed the emergence of the M184V mutation in 4/16, all of whom were < 12 years of age.  
TDF in ART-Experienced HIV-Infected Adolescents 
Study GS-US-104-0321 involved randomisation of treatment experienced adolescents with plasma HIV-
1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL (i.e. failing their prior regimen) to TDF or placebo, each given with a genotype-
guided OBR. After week 48 a switch from placebo to TDF was allowed. The TDF and placebo groups 
exhibited decreases from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA with median time-weighted average changes 
from baseline through Week 24 (DAVG24) of −1.580 log 10 copies/mL in the TDF group and −1.549 log 10 
copies in the placebo group. According to Della Negra et al. (2015) at week 144 the proportions with HIV-
1 RNA <50 copies/mL were 30.4% (7/23) for those initially randomised to TDF and 41.7% (5/12) for 
those who switched from PBO to TDF.  
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in HIV-1 RNA DAVG24 or for 
any of the secondary efficacy endpoints at any of the time points analysed as follows: 
• 
• 
The median DAVG48 in plasma HIV-1 RNA was −1.423 log 10 copies/mL in the TDF group and 
−1.352 log10 copies/mL in the placebo group (p = 0.40). 
The median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels at Week 48 (LOCF) was −0.97 log 10 
copies/mL in the TDF group and −1.53 log 10 copies/mL in the placebo group (p = 0.37). 
•  Nine of 45 TDF subjects compared to 2/42 placebo subjects developed NRTI-associated resistance 
mutations at Week 48. This difference was due to more subjects developing K65R (n = 1), M184V 
(n = 4) and thymidine-analogue associated mutations (TAMs; n = 4) in the TDF group as 
compared to the placebo group (n = 0, 2 and 1, respectively). 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 19/55 
 
  
  
  
 
• 
The mean CD4 cell count increase from baseline to Week 48 was 155 cells/mm³ for TDF and 182 
cells/mm³ for placebo. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in CD4 
percentage or change from baseline at any post-baseline time point up to Week 48. 
Study GS-US-236-0112 evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of the 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate single-tablet regimen (Stribild) in HIV-1 
infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive adolescents. Fifty subjects aged 12-<18 years and at least 
35 kg in the US, South Africa and Thailand. Subjects had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 1,000 copies/mL, 
CD4 cell counts > 100 cells/μL and eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2 (as calculated using the Schwartz formula) 
at screening. At the data cut for the interim Week 48 analysis, 48 had completed main study treatment 
and 40 had entered into the extension phase, with 35 still receiving study treatment. 
The virologic success rate achieved with STB was 88.0% (44/50) at Weeks 24 and 48 using the FDA-
defined snapshot algorithm with a cut-off of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. Rates were 94.0% at Week 24 
and 92.0% at Week 48 at the < 400 copies/mL cut-off. Using both the M = F and M = E analyses, the 
percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 20 copies/mL was 80.0% and 86.0% at Weeks 24 and 48, 
respectively. The percentage of subjects who were pure virologic responders at Week 48 was 84.0% 
(42/50). Through Week 48, 2 subjects experienced pure virologic failure (PVF) and study drug 
discontinuation (1 who had PVF before study drug discontinuation due to non-adherence and 1 who 
discontinued due to pregnancy before PVF). 
At Weeks 24 and 48, the mean (SD) change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA was −3.08 (0.922) log10 
copies/mL and −3.16 (0.705) log10 copies/mL, respectively. At Weeks 24 and 48, the mean (SD) increase 
from baseline in CD4 cell count was 178 (165.4) cells/μL and 229 (245.3) cells/μL, respectively, and the 
mean (SD) increase from baseline in CD4% was 7.4% (4.70%) and 8.1% (5.34%), respectively. 
Of the 50 subjects, 3 (6%) met the criteria for inclusion in the resistance analysis population. No subjects 
developed resistance to study drugs. 
PrEP in young adults (MSM aged 18-22 years) 
Study ATN 110 was an open-label study of once daily TVD in 200 MSM (77.8% homosexual; rest 
bisexual) aged 18-22 years. They were also offered one of two types of counselling in addition to that 
supplied at each visit under the protocol routine measures. The median age of subjects enrolled was 20 
years. The most common races were black/African American (46.5%), white/non-Hispanic (21.0%) and 
other/mixed race (21.0%). Overall, 81% reported unprotected (no condom) rectal intercourse in the past 
month, 58% reported unprotected rectal intercourse with their last partner and 28.6% reported 
exchanging sex for money. At baseline, 22% had a positive STI test result.  
Of the 200 enrolled, 58 prematurely discontinued from the study including 34 LTFU and two because of a 
diagnosis of acute HIV infection identified by HIV RNA assay at the baseline visit. Overall, study retention 
was 71% but for those that remained on study the visit retention was 91.8% of all expected visits.  
Through 48 weeks 4 subjects experienced seroconversion events (HIV incidence = 3.29 per 100 person-
years; 95% CI 0.07 to 6.52) with one event each at Week 4, 32, 40 and 48. None of the subjects who 
seroconverted had detectable levels of TFV-DP in the sample that was drawn closest to the 
seroconversion date (see Figure 4). All subjects who seroconverted were immediately linked to medical 
care and no ARV drug resistance was detected.

Adherence decreased over the 48-week treatment period. The most common reasons reported by 
subjects for missing study pills were forgot (28.5%), away from home (27.3%) and too busy with other 
things (26.7%). Subjects also reported missing their medication due to wanting to avoid side effects 
(4.48%), because they did not want others to see them taking the medication (2.47%) and because they 
believed the pill was harmful (1.9%).  
Based on categorisation of subjects as adherent (≥ 4 pills/week) or non-adherent (< 4 pills/week) the 
adherent subjects worried less about getting HIV (p = 0.01), felt more comfortable having sex with a 
HIV-positive partner (p = 0.01) and feared developing medication resistance if they contracted HIV (p = 
0.004) compared with non-adherent subjects. Significantly more non-adherent subjects reported not 
liking taking pills than adherent subjects (p = 0.02). One-third of subjects did not like the size of the pill 
and over half (52.2%) did not like the taste of the pill. However, most subjects (60.3%) found that it was 
acceptable taking a pill every day.  
The overall STI incidence rate on study was 66.44 (95% CI: 50.53 – 82.35), with greater STI incidence in 
the first 24 weeks of study (76.48/100 person-years) than the latter half of the study (60.99/100 person-
years). An additional indicator of HIV exposure – post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) prescriptions – 
remained stable with 1 or 0 subjects requesting PEP at each study visit week. 
PrEP in adolescents 
Study ATN 113 was an open-label study of once daily TVD in 15 to 17-year-old HIV uninfected MSM 
(homosexual [58%] or bisexual) who reported HIV transmission risk behaviour in the previous 6 months. 
Study visits occurred at baseline, monthly through week 12 and then quarterly through week 48. Dried 
blood spots were serially collected for the quantification of TFV-DP.  
There were 79 subjects enrolled and 32 discontinued early, including 19 who were LTFU. The mean age of 
subjects was 16.5 years. Subjects reported a mean of 2 male partners in the past month, 60% reported 
unprotected receptive anal intercourse with their last partner and 17% had been previously been paid for 
sex. At baseline, 15.4% of subjects had a positive sexually transmitted infection (STI) test result.  
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 21/55 
 
  
  
  
 
 
The 3 subjects with seroconversion through 48 weeks (HIV incidence = 6.4 per 100 person-years; 95% 
CI: 0.0 to 13.7) had TFV-DP levels consistent with < 2 doses per week. 
Figure 5.  ATN-113: TDF-DP levels among seroconverts  
Adherence  decreased  over  the  48-week  treatment  period,  as  demonstrated  by  the  levels  of  TFV-DP  in 
DBS (see the previous section). The most common overall non-adherence reasons were away from home 
(31.7%),  too  busy  (27.6%),  forgot  to  take  medication  (25.8%)  and  change  in  routine  (18.5%).  Non-
adherent  subjects  were  more  likely  to  worry  about others  observing  them taking  pills  and  thinking  they 
were HIV positive and/or that they were having sex with other men. At Weeks 12 and 48 over 70% and 
over 60% found Truvada pills acceptable and about 40% found the taste to be acceptable.  
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Once daily dosing with FTC 200 mg and TDF 300 mg when used as part of appropriate regimens, is 
effective for the treatment of HIV-1 in adolescents who are adherent.  
The efficacy of daily TVD for PrEP in male adolescents who have sex with other males can be expected to 
be the same as that previously described in MSM at the same level of treatment adherence. However, the 
few available data in adolescent males aged 15-17 years and in 18-22 year-old adult males who had a 
history of unprotected rectal intercourse indicate a marked drop off in study participation and in 
adherence to treatment over time. 
Through 48 weeks of treatment with TVD for PrEP in adult males aged 18-22 in ATN 110 the HIV 
incidence was 3.29 per 100 person-years. In the adolescents in ATN 113 the HIV seroconversion rate was 
double this at 6.4 per 100 person-years. In reality, PrEP may be far less successful in subjects aged < 18 
years or 18-22 years compared to older adult men simply due to poor adherence. 
For example, although cross-study comparisons must be made with caution, ATN 100 and 113 gave HIV 
seroconversion rates similar to or higher than observed in the placebo group in the randomised phase of 
iPrEX. In the open label extension phase of iPrEX 1526/1678 eligible subjects were MSM who had 
previously been enrolled in iPrEx and avoided acquisition of HIV-1. Other subjects came from two other 
studies in men and transgender women who have sex with men. Of those receiving PrEP, the HIV 
incidence was 1.8 infections per 100 p-y, compared with 2.6 infections per 100 p-y in those who 
concurrently did not choose PrEP (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–1.01, adjusted for sexual behaviours). These 
rates compare with 3.9 infections per 100 p-y in the placebo group of the previous randomised phase in 
iPrEx (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31–0.77). Considering only participants from iPrEx, the HIV incidence on PrEP 
was 53% (95% CI 26 to 70) lower than in the placebo group of the randomised phase (3.93 infections 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 22/55 
 
  
  
  
 
 
per 100 p-y) and 51% (95% CI 23 to 69) lower than during the gap between the randomised phase and 
the OLE (3.81 infections per 100 p-y). 
There is also an issue surrounding gender. Effectiveness data from the Partners PrEP study showed that 
women had a numerically higher seroconversion rate than their male counterparts across all 3 treatment 
groups (including placebo). When efficacy was assessed by sex, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the hazard ratios (HRs) for reduction in HIV-1 infection risk were overlapping between males and females 
for the Truvada or Viread groups relative to placebo. Poor adherence (< 80% pill count) was less 
prevalent among women than men in the sub-study. Overall, the Partners PrEP results supported an 
association between high rates of adherence and high rates of efficacy among study participants of both 
sexes. However, there are no data on TVD PrEP in female adolescents. No assumptions can be made 
regarding adherence in female adolescents, especially when women in Partners’ PrEP were highly 
motivated to protect themselves within the setting of stable serodiscordant couples, which is not a setting 
likely to apply to adolescents. This is a concern in female adolescent sex workers who request PrEP as 
they could have multiple risk exposures per day or per week. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Use of TVD from the age of 12 years is supported by efficacy data. If adherence were to be similar in 
adolescents as in the older subjects enrolled into iPrEX and Partners’ PrEP then there is no reason to think 
that protection would be any different. Study ATN 113 indicate that adherence to Truvada for PrEP in 
male adolescents (15 to 18 years of age) was good in the first three months but then declined over time, 
a result that was partially confounded by the decreased frequency of scheduled clinic visits over the 
course of the study. To address this concern the CHMP requested to reinforce the importance of 
maintaining adherence at frequent intervals for the duration of the PrEP intervention with Truvada. 
Subjects aged 12-15 years are likely to be even more vulnerable to the considerations that led to poor 
adherence in subjects aged 15-22 years. Setting a minimum age of 12 years or simply referring to 
adolescents in the indication rather than mentioning a lower age cut-off would require very careful 
consideration of the position and level of understanding of the individual patient. It is not just the 
subjects’ ability to understand the importance of adherence but also to appreciate the potential risks of 
taking Truvada in terms of the possible long term effects on bone and renal function. These concerns are 
adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.4. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Exposure of adolescents to FTC, TDF and TVD 
In FTC-202, FTC-203 and FTC-211 there were 34 subjects aged 13 to 21 years (29 aged < 18 years). 
Collectively, across the three clinical studies, 152 subjects aged < 18 years received FTC for at least 48 
weeks and 88 were treated for at least 96 weeks. 
The long-term paediatric and adolescent study GS-US-104-0321 included 45 adolescents initially 
randomised to TDF + OBR in whom median (Q1, Q3) exposure to TDF in the double-blind phase was 
47.71 (37.7, 48.0) weeks. In the open label phase, including those who switched to TDF, 81 subjects 
received TDF. Up to Week 336, the median duration of exposure was 72.0 weeks (Q1, Q3: 37.7, 144.0) 
with a maximum of 294 weeks. 
In GS-US-236-0112 as of the cut-off for the Week 48 CSR, the median (Q1, Q3) duration of exposure to 
study drug was 61.6 weeks (52.1, 96.3) and 30.0% had received STB for ≥ 96 weeks.

Exposure data are not available for ATN 110 but 135/200 completed a Week 48 visit. Similarly, exposure 
data are not available for ATN 113 but 32/79 discontinued prematurely. Also, exposure is unknown since 
there was marked waning in adherence over 48 weeks (see previous section). 
Adverse Events 
Over 48 weeks and across the age groups 113/116 subjects (97.4%) had at least 1 AE in Study FTC-203 
as did 10/16 subjects (62.5%) in Study FTC-211. Also, 11/37 subjects (29.7%) in Study FTC-202 had 
AEs of Grade 3 or Grade 4 severity, most of which were SAEs (see below) but including non-serious rash 
(n = 1), low glucose (n = 1) and ear pain (n = 1), all considered unrelated to study treatment. The most 
frequent (≥ 10%) AEs reported through the 48-week cut-off date in Study FTC-203 are shown below. A 
number  of  events  (e.g.  rash,  eczema,  diarrhoea  and  otitis  media)  were  reported  with  decreasing 
frequency according to increasing age. All except one subject in Study FTC-211 were aged 13 to 17 years 
and the AE profile was similar to that in this same age range in Study FTC-203.

A subset of skin discoloration events, identified by medical review of adverse events that coded to COSTART term “skin discoloration.” 
In GS-US-104-0321 in the double-blind treatment period up to Week 48, all 45 TDF and 40 (95%) 
placebo patients reported at least 1 AE. In the TDF group, the most commonly reported AEs were 
vomiting, sinusitis, nausea and cough. By Week 336, AEs were reported for 77 subjects (95.1%) in the 
All TDF group. The most common AEs in the All TDF group were sinusitis, cough and vomiting.

AEs considered to be related to study drug by the investigator were reported for 18 subjects (22.2%) in 
the All TDF group, including 14 subjects (31.1%) in the TDF subgroup and 4 subjects (11.1%) in the 
placebo/TDF subgroup. The study drug-related AEs reported for more than 1 subject in the All TDF group 
were vomiting (4), osteopenia (5 [6.2%]) and gastritis (2).  
The majority of AEs reported in the study were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported for 7 
subjects (8.6%) in the All TDF group, including 5 subjects (11.1%) in the TDF subgroup and 2 (5.6%) in 
the placebo/TDF subgroup. No Grade 3 or 4 AE was reported for more than 1 subject. One subject (2.2%) 
in the TDF subgroup experienced Grade 3 hyperamylasaemia considered by the investigator to be related 
to study drug with onset on Day 1341. No action was taken and the event resolved on Day 1352.

Multiple AEs were counted only once per subject for each system organ class and preferred term, respectively. System organ class was presented 
alphabetically and preferred term was presented by descending order of the total frequencies. 
Adverse events related to study drug were reported for 10 subjects (20.0%). Headache (8.0%, 4 
subjects) and nausea (6.0%, 3 subjects) were the only study drug-related AEs reported for more than 2 
subjects. Most AEs reported were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. No Grade 4 AEs were reported. Grade 3 
AEs were reported for 2 subjects (4.0%) including Shigella gastroenteritis and suicidal behaviour in one 
subject and weight decreased in the other subject. 
Three subjects in Study ATN 110 had AEs deemed related to study drug: nausea, weight loss and 
headache. All were Grade 3 (ATN Grading Severity of Adolescent Adverse Events) and resolved when 
medication was discontinued. An additional 21 Grade 3 or higher AEs deemed unrelated to study drug 
were reported for 15 subjects; no further information regarding these events is available. 
In ATN-113 three Grade 3 AEs were reported for 2 subjects that were considered related to study drug 
by the investigator.  
SAEs and deaths  
In Study FTC-203 one child aged 2 years died with acute myeloid leukaemia. No other deaths were 
reported in the studies of interest. 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 27/55 
 
  
  
  
In Study FTC-203, 24 subjects (20.7%) experienced at least one SAE but no SAEs occurred in the 13-17 
years age group. SAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject were pneumonia (7), hepatitis A (4), 
pharyngitis and accidental injury (3 for each) and pancreatitis (2). Three SAEs were assessed by the 
reporting investigator as possibly or probably related to study drug, including one subject with Grade 3 
anaemia and 2 subjects with pancreatitis assessed as related to the use of FTC and d4T who discontinued 
from the study. 
In FTC-202 12 subjects developed SAEs, including 6 who were hospitalised. Four of these SAEs occurred 
in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. No SAE occurred in more than two subjects. SAEs included elevated 
creatine kinase (2) and single reports of LFTs increased, decreased glucose, nausea with asthenia and 
dizziness, abdominal pain with headache (subject was also hospitalised for lymphadenitis), mild cervical 
dysplasia with human papilloma virus, rash with diarrhoea, rectal pain, herpes zoster, otitis media and 
major depression. 
In Study FTC-211, a 15-year-old subject had 2 SAEs of mumps and orchitis not related to FTC. 
During the double-blind treatment period up to Week 48 of Study GS-US-104-0321, SAEs were reported 
for 10 TDF subjects [22.2%] and 3 placebo subjects [7.1%]. SAEs reported for more than 1 subject were 
pneumonia (TDF 3; placebo 1) and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and sinusitis (TDF 2; placebo 0). 
By the end of the study at Week 336, SAEs were reported for 20 subjects (24.7%) in the All TDF group, 
including 12 subjects (26.7%) in the TDF subgroup and 8 subjects (22.2%) in the placebo/TDF subgroup. 
SAEs reported for > 1 subject in the All TDF group were pneumonia (5), herpes zoster (3), Pneumocystis 
jiroveci pneumonia (2) and sinusitis (2). No SAE was considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Through 48 weeks of STB treatment in GS-US-236-0112 four subjects (8.0%) had an SAE. Acute kidney 
injury in 1 subject was noted as a clinically significant renal event (see details below). Disseminated 
tuberculosis in another subject was noted as a CDC Class C AIDS-defining event. No SAE occurred in 
more than 1 subject, and none was considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Information on SAEs for Studies ATN 110 and ATN 113 is not available.  
AEs leading to discontinuation 
Three 3 subjects in Study FTC-203 (none was adolescent) discontinued due to AEs. Two subjects in 
Study FTC-202 had an AE of rash (one adolescent) that led to study drug discontinuation and both 
resolved within 3 weeks of the last dose. No instances occurred in FTC-211 or in GS-US-236-0112. 
In Study GS-US-104-0321 through Week 336 one subject had an AE of vomiting that led to study drug 
discontinuation. The event resolved the same day. 
In Study ATN 110, the most common reasons for discontinuation were personal choice/decision and AEs 
(predominantly GI symptoms). In the publication details are available for 3 subjects who discontinued 
due to nausea, weight loss or headache. One participant in ATN 113permanently discontinued TDF/FTC 
due to possibly related Grade 3 weight loss. 
Adverse Events of Interest or Important Adverse Events 
From preclinical studies, the target organs of toxicity associated with FTC were confined to high dose 
groups and consisted of changes in erythrocyte parameters. Mild reversible anaemia was observed in 
mice at more than 150 times the AUC exposure in humans dosed with 200 mg/day. In the FTC SmPC the 
ADRs that were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects vs. adults in clinical studies and post-
marketing experience were anaemia (common) and increased skin pigmentation (very common). 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 28/55 
 
  
  
  
Gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhoea and nausea were reported as very common ADRs with both 
FTC and TDF components of TVD. Renal and bone ADRs are considered to be of special interest for TDF 
because of nonclinical toxicity findings and post-marketing safety surveillance data. 
Hyperpigmentation 
The overall incidence of hyperpigmentation was 42/132 subjects (31.8%) across Studies FTC-203 and 
FTC-211 but all reported cases occurred in study FTC-203 and there were no events in Study FTC-202. 
None of the cases of hyperpigmentation occurred in adolescents. 
Haematologic toxicities 
The overall incidence of anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia in studies FTC-203, FTC-202 and FTC-211 
was 9.5% (16/169). In Study FTC-203 there were no cases in the 13 to 17 years age group. 
Renal Events 
During the double-blind treatment period of Study GS-US-104-0321, 6 TDF (13.3%) and 4 placebo 
subjects (9.5%) reported at least one AE in the renal and urinary disorders SOC. The only renal event 
reported for > 1 subject in either group was haematuria, which was reported for 2 in each treatment 
group. No renal and urinary AEs in the TDF group were considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. In the placebo group, AEs of nephrolithiasis and haematuria (each reported for 1 subject 
[2.4%]) were considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
By the end of the study at Week 336, no AEs of Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy were reported. The 
only renal AE reported for > 1 subject in the All TDF group was proteinuria in 2 subjects (2.5%). Two 
subjects met the algorithm-specified criteria for potential PRT, of which one was not considered to have 
PRT because of intermittent laboratory abnormalities that were not confirmed and generally were not 
concurrent. The other subject had findings consistent with PRT, some of which resolved during continued 
therapy with TDF. Neither subject discontinued TDF prematurely. 
During the double-blind treatment period up to Week 48 the median serum creatinine concentrations 
were below the normal range at baseline and did not change markedly to Week 48 in either group. No 
graded serum creatinine abnormalities were reported. After the double-blind treatment period at Weeks 
144 and 336 there were small increases from baseline in serum creatinine in the All TDF group (median 
change from baseline at Week 144 was 0.16 mg/dL [n = 25] and at Week 192 was 0.24 mg/dL [n = 16]). 
No graded serum creatinine abnormalities were reported. 
Median serum phosphate concentrations were within the normal range at baseline and did not change 
markedly to Week 48 in either group. By the end of the study at Week 336, no clinically relevant changes 
from baseline were seen in the All TDF group.  
Reductions from baseline to Week 48 in estimated creatinine clearance were observed with median 
changes from baseline to Week 48 of −11.00 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the TDF group and −5.35 mL/min/1.73 
m2 in the placebo group. The median absolute values remained within normal ranges. At Week 144, the 
median change from baseline was –38.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the All TDF group (n = 25, p < 0.001, 
Wilcoxon signed rank test). Median changes from baseline at Week 144 were −36.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 
12, p < 0.001) in the TDF subgroup and −43.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 13, p < 0.001) in the placebo/TDF 
subgroup. The changes were considered to be consistent with normal changes in renal function in an 
adolescent population progressing towards adulthood. 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 29/55 
 
  
  
  
No case of Grade 3/4 proteinuria was reported in either treatment group up to Week 48. Proteinuria was 
reported as an SAE for 1 subject in the TDF group but it was not considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. By Week 336, Grade 3 proteinuria was reported for 1 subject in the TDF subgroup.  
No graded urine glucose abnormalities were reported in the double-blind period. By Week 336, Grade 1 
glycosuria was reported for 3 subjects (3.7%) in the All TDF group, including 2 subjects (4.4%) in the 
TDF subgroup and 1 subject (2.8%) in the placebo/TDF subgroup. 
In GS-US-236-0112, with cobicistat in the STB, increases in serum creatinine were noted as early as 
Week 2, after which they generally stabilised through Week 48. The median change from baseline at 
Weeks 2 and 24 was 0.08 mg/dL and at Week 48 it was 0.11 mg/dL.  
Median serum phosphorus values were within normal ranges throughout the study. 
Decreases in eGFR using the Schwartz formula followed the pattern of serum creatinine changes. The 
median change from baseline at Week 2 and Week 48 was −15.0 mL/min/1.73 m2. Using the modified 
Schwartz formula, the median changes from baseline at Weeks 2, 24 and 48 were −7.4, −4.2 and −3.6 
mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. 
The only urine glucose abnormality reported was Grade 2 urine glucose in 1 subject. The subject had 
Grade 1 urine glucose on Day 225, which increased to Grade 2 on Day 421 and was ongoing at Day 684 
(trace), but was normoglycaemic throughout. The subject also had concurrent Grade 1 to 2 proteinuria. 
At baseline, 4/50 (8.0%) had proteinuria as assessed by dipstick analysis (all Grade 1). Post-baseline, 
Grade 1 or 2 proteinuria, generally isolated and transient, was reported for 22 subjects (44%; 15 Grade 
1, 7 Grade 2). There was an increase in proteinuria as assessed by urine protein to creatinine ratio for 
which the median [Q1, Q3] percentage change from baseline to Week 48 was 8.70% [−20.64%, 
52.06%]. There was an increase in urine retinol binding protein to creatinine ratio with a median 
percentage change from baseline to Week 48 of 14.21% [−15.12%, 61.13%]). The urine beta-2-
microglobulin to creatinine ratio decreased with a median percentage change from baseline to Week 48 of 
−23.7% [−38.7%, 51.3%]). Other renal laboratory parameters (renal tubular maximum reabsorption 
rate of phosphate to the glomerular filtration rate, fractional excretion of phosphate and fractional 
excretion of uric acid using serum creatinine standard or adjusted values) remained relatively stable from 
baseline through Week 48. 
There were no reported cases of PRT or Fanconi syndrome. One clinically significant renal SAE involved 
acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration from Shigella dysentery, with onset on Day 275 and 
duration of 6 days. The event was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator and study drug 
was continued. Serum creatinine at baseline was 0.90 mg/dL and values on Days 282, 337 and 366 were 
1.19, 1.23 and 0.92 mg/dL, respectively. Estimated GFR (Schwartz) at baseline was 121 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and values at Days 282, 337 and 366 were 92, 89 and 119 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. No graded 
abnormality of serum creatinine was reported. Intermittent Grade 1 proteinuria was noted at Days 113, 
144, 170, 282, 337 (Week 48) and 366. Serum phosphate and urine glucose were within normal 
reference ranges at all visits. The absence of persistent renal abnormalities suggested no PRT. 
Bone Safety 
Fracture AEs were reported for 2 subjects in the TDF group (clavicle fracture and right malleolar fracture) 
during the double-blind treatment period of Study GS-US-104-0321. These were non-serious and were 
not considered related to study drug by the investigator. Osteopenia was reported as a non-serious AE for 
3 subjects (6.7%) in the TDF group and 2 subjects (4.8%) in the placebo group in the double-blind 
treatment period and all were considered related to study drug. After the double-blind treatment period, 
up to Week 336 no further fracture AEs or AEs of osteopenia were reported. 
EMA/10650/2018

In Study GS-US-236-0112, no fracture events were reported. In Study ATN-110, 5/200 reported 
fracture events that all appear to have been trauma-related.  
Different methodologies were used for the analyses of BMD between TDF in HIV-infected adolescents, FTC 
and TDF in HIV-infected adolescents and TVD in HIV-uninfected young adults. Therefore, no direct 
comparisons can be made. The following describes BMD and bone biomarker data by study. 
During the double-blind treatment period of GS-US-104-0321, differences between the TDF and placebo 
groups in the percentage change from baseline in spine BMD were not statistically significant.  
As expected for this adolescent population, increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD were seen for 
both treatment groups at Weeks 24 and 48 with mean [SD] changes from baseline at Week 48 of 3.148% 
[7.2936%] for TDF and 3.807% [4.9797%] for placebo (p = 0.54). After the double-blind treatment 
period, the median percentage changes for the All TDF group in spine BMD from baseline (baseline 
median 0.964 g/cm2) to Week 144 were 12.702% (n = 26) and at Weeks 192 and 240 the changes were 
16.920% (n = 18) and 19.137% (n = 11), respectively. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in spine BMD Z-scores in either TDF or placebo group at Weeks 
24 or 48. In the TDF group, no clinically relevant changes were seen at any time point. After the double-
blind treatment period, among the 28 subjects who received TDF for 96 weeks, a decrease in the spine 
BMD Z-score was observed (−0.341). After Week 96, the median changes from baseline in unadjusted 
spine BMD Z-scores were not significant.

During the double-blind treatment period at Week 48, differences between groups in the percentage 
change from baseline in total body BMD were not statistically significant. As expected for this adolescent 
population, increases from baseline in total body BMD were seen in both groups at Weeks 24 and 48 with 
mean [SD] changes from baseline to Week 48 of 1.495% [3.1138%] for TDF and 1.518% [3.8072%] for 
placebo (p = 0.96). The median percentage change in total body BMD from baseline to Week 144 was 
4.322% (n = 26), to Week 192 was 5.869% (n = 18) and to Week 240 was 6.951% (n = 11). 
The mean (SD) total body BMD Z-score at baseline was −0.866 (1.2293) for subjects in the TDF group 
and −0.584 (1.2245) for subjects in the placebo group, suggesting that these children were below 
average height and weight for their sex and age There were no clinically relevant changes in total body 
BMD Z-scores in either group at Weeks 24 or 48. At Week 48, the mean (SD) change in total bone BMD 
Z-score was −0.254 (0.3918) for subjects in the TDF group and −0.179 (0.3453) for subjects in the

placebo group. Among the 15 subjects who received TDF for 96 weeks, the mean (SD) total body BMD Z-
score had decreased −0.403 [0.6647]). By Week 336, 13/81 (16.05%) in the All TDF group had 
decreases from baseline of > 4% in spine and/or total body BMD at ≥1 time points (11 subjects in the 
TDF subgroup and 2 in the placebo/TDF subgroup). Of these 13, 11 had decreases > 4% in spine BMD 
only, 1 had decreases > 4% in total body BMD only and 1 had decreases > 4% in spine and total body 
BMD. 
Decreases > 4% were persistent (occurring at more than 1 consecutive visit) in 5/13 subjects. Also, 3/13 
had low BMD at any visit (spine or total body unadjusted Z-score ≤ −2.0).

During the double-blind treatment period at Week 48 there were no significant differences between 
treatment groups in the change from baseline in markers of bone formation (serum osteocalcin and bone-
specific alkaline phosphatase) at any time point. By Week 336, decreases from baseline were observed 
with long-term treatment in the All TDF group: 
• 
• 
The median changes from baseline in serum osteocalcin were −16.6 ng/mL at Week 144 (n = 
22), −42.3 ng/mL at Week 192 (n = 14) and −73.0 ng/mL at Week 240 (n = 6).  
The median changes from baseline in bone specific alkaline phosphatase were −24.6 U/L at Week 
144 (n = 24), −51.8 U/L at Week 192 (n = 15) and −38.6 U/L at Week 240 (n = 5). 
During the double-blind treatment period at Week 48, there were no statistically significant differences 
between groups in the change from baseline in markers of bone resorption (N- and C-telopeptides) at any 
time point. There were decreases from baseline in C-telopeptides after Week 48 in the All TDF group with 
median changes from baseline of −0.434 ng/mL at Week 144 (n = 21), −0.406 ng/mL at Week 168 (n = 
15), −0.512 ng/mL at Week 192 (n = 14) and −0.580 ng/mL at Week 240 (n = 5). There were also 
decreases from baseline in N-telopeptides at Weeks 72 to 168, but from Week 192 there were increases 
in N-telopeptides for the small numbers of subjects with available data. 
The median change from baseline for bone collagen equivalent [BCE] N-telopeptides was −3.9 nM BCE at 
Week 144 (n = 18), −20.3 nM BCE at Week 168 (n = 13), 24.2 nM BCE at Week 192 (n = 10) and 113.6 
nM BCE at Week 240 (n = 3). 
The baseline values for PTH were significantly lower in the TDF group (median 38 pg/mL vs. 47 pg/mL, p 
= 0.033). Differences between groups in the change from baseline in PTH were statistically significant at 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 32/55 
 
  
  
  
 
Weeks 4, 16, and 24, but not at Weeks 32 and 48. There were small increases in PTH in the TDF group 
compared to small decreases in the placebo group but the median values remained in the normal range in 
both groups. By Week 336, there were generally small increases from baseline in PTH in the All TDF 
group. The median changes were 8.0 pg/mL (n = 23, p = 0.010) at Week 144, 8.0 pg/mL (n = 13, p = 
0.37) at Week 192 and −1.4 pg/mL (n = 6, p = 0.69) at Week 240 and values were in the normal range. 
During the double-blind treatment period, there were no statistically significant differences between TDF 
and placebo groups in the change from baseline in 25-OH Vitamin D at any time. There were statistically 
significant median increases from baseline through Week 144 in the All TDF group. The median decreases 
in 25-OH vitamin D observed at some of the later time points in the study were in small numbers of 
subjects and were not sustained. 
In GS-US-236-0112 the percentages of subjects with ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine and TBLH 
BMD at Weeks 24 and 48 were as follows: 
•  Spine: 10/47 (21.3%) at Week 24 and 7/46 (15.2%) at Week 48 (6 had ≥ 4% decrease at both 
Weeks 24 and 48) 
• 
TBLH: 1/49 (2.0%) at Week 24 and 2/48 (4.2%) at Week 48 (1 had ≥ 4% decrease at both 
Weeks 24 and 48).

In Study ATN 110, the median BMD Z-Scores at baseline (spine −0.50, hip −0.45, whole body −0.40) 
were consistent with other PrEP studies in HIV-negative at-risk men.   
Figure 6.  ATN 110: Percentage Changes from Baseline in BMD and Z Scores at Weeks 24 and 48 
Bone results in seroconverters (n = 4) were censored beginning with date of seroconversion. 
Hip results in 1 participant were censored due to interference from implants. 
Between baseline and Week 24, median BMD decreased in the hip (−0.44%), spine (−0.23%) and whole 
body (−0.61%). The decreases were statistically significant in the hip and whole body (p < 0.001). 
Median BMD decreased from baseline at Week 48 in the hip and whole body (approximately −1.0% and 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 34/55 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
−0.7%, respectively; p < 0.001 for the change from baseline), but increased in the spine (approximately 
0.4%). 
Decreases from baseline in all Z-scores were small but statistically significant at Weeks 24 and 48 
(median absolute change from baseline at Week 24: spine approximately −0.08, hip approximately −0.02 
[p = 0.02], whole body approximately −0.09; at Week 48: spine approximately −0.10, hip approximately 
−0.04, whole body approximately −0.10; p < 0.001 for all other parameters at both time points).  
After 48 weeks, changes in hip and spine BMD were negatively correlated with the magnitude of TFV 
exposure. That is, bone loss in participants with TFV-DP in the range considered to be highly protective in 
adults (> 700 fmol/punch) was significantly greater than in those with drug levels below the limit of 
quantitation. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Through Week 48 in study FTC-203, treatment-emergent grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in 
6/116 subjects (5%). The overall incidence of Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities through a median 
follow up of 96 weeks was 8.6% (10 subjects). These included elevated ALT (3), neutropenia, 
hyperbilirubinaemia, and elevated amylase [normal lipase] (each in 2) and elevated AST, low 
haemoglobin, elevated lipase and low platelets (each in 1 subject). The overall incidence of Grade 3 and 4 
laboratory abnormalities was consistently low in FTC-211 and FTC-202. 
In GS-US-104-0321 up to Week 48, Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were reported for 10 in the TDF group 
and 9 in the placebo group. The most frequently reported were abnormalities of neutrophil counts (7 TDF 
and 2 placebo) and total bilirubin (4 in each group). By Week 336, Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were 
reported for 25 subjects in the All TDF group, including 12 in the TDF subgroup and 13 in the placebo/TDF 
subgroup. The most commonly reported were abnormalities in neutrophil counts (15) and total bilirubin 
(7).  
In Study GS-US-236-0112, transient Grade 3 increased AST and Grade 4 increased creatine kinase at 
Week 40 were reported for 1 subject, who had a tendency toward increased creatine kinase values from 
screening onward. Grade 3 increased creatine kinase at Weeks 16 and 40 were reported for 1 subject, 
who also had Grade 1 increased AST at the same time points.  
Clinical laboratory data were not available for Study ATN 110 or ATN 113. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Effectively, the safety data on use of FTC and TDF in adolescents come from studies in HIV-infected 
subjects. The safety profiles of each of FTC and TDF are well known for HIV-infected adults. Although 
there are relatively few safety data obtained in clinical trials with these agents in adolescents the overall 
safety profile appears to be similar to that in adults. 
Whilst FTC is not without its safety issues, the main concerns with regard to the use of TVD in uninfected 
adolescents relate to the effects of TFV on renal function and normal bone formation and turnover. 
Renal effects 
During the double-blind treatment period of Study GS-US-104-0321, 6 TDF (13.3%) and 4 placebo 
subjects (9.5%) reported at least one AE in the renal and urinary disorders SOC but none in the TDF 
group was considered related to study drug by the investigator. By the end of the study at Week 336, no 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 35/55 
 
  
  
  
AEs of Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy were reported. The only renal AE reported for > 1 subject in the 
All TDF group was proteinuria in 2 subjects (2.5%).  
Two subjects met the algorithm-specified criteria for potential PRT, one of which had findings consistent 
with PRT although some of these resolved during continued therapy with TDF. Neither subject 
discontinued TDF prematurely. 
Reductions from baseline to Week 48 in eGFR were −11.00 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the TDF group and −5.35 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group and at Week 144 the median change from baseline was –38.1 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the All TDF group. The changes were considered to be consistent with normal 
changes in renal function in an adolescent population progressing towards adulthood but there was no 
control group after Week 48 to put the changes into context. 
In GS-US-236-0112, with cobicistat in the STB, there were expected initial increases in serum creatinine 
and decreases in eGFR that stabilised through Week 48. At baseline, 4/50 (8.0%) had proteinuria as 
assessed by dipstick analysis (all Grade 1). Post-baseline, Grade 1 or 2 proteinuria, generally isolated and 
transient, was reported for 22 subjects (44%; 15 Grade 1, 7 Grade 2). There was an increase in 
proteinuria as assessed by urine protein to creatinine ratio, an increase in urine retinol binding protein to 
creatinine ratio and a decrease in the urine beta-2-microglobulin to creatinine ratio. There were no 
reported cases of PRT or Fanconi syndrome. 
Bone effects 
Cross-study comparisons cannot be made due to the differences in methodologies and the different age 
ranges enrolled. In this regard, peak bone mass is generally achieved by 30 years of age, and 80% of 
peak bone mass is attained by age 18 years. The greatest gains in bone mass at the spine and the hip 
occur between 11 and 14 years of age in girls and 13 and 17 years of age in boys.  
Adolescent subjects in Study GS-US-104-0321 were within the period of greatest gain and BMD 
increased. Over 48 weeks the differences between the TDF and placebo groups in the percentage change 
from baseline in spine or total body BMD were not statistically significant. Increases from baseline in 
lumbar spine BMD at Week 48 were 3.148% for TDF and 3.807% for placebo (p = 0.54). After the 
double-blind treatment period, the median percentage change for the All TDF group in spine BMD from 
baseline to Week 144 was 12.702% (n = 26). There were no clinically relevant changes in spine BMD Z-
scores in either TDF or placebo group at Weeks 24 or 48. After the double-blind treatment period, among 
the 28 subjects who received TDF for 96 weeks, a decrease in the spine BMD Z-score was observed 
(−0.341).  
Increases from baseline in total body BMD to Week 48 were 1.495% for TDF and 1.518% for placebo (p 
= 0.96). The median percentage change in total body BMD from baseline to Week 144 was 4.322%. At 
Week 48, the mean change in total bone BMD Z-score was −0.254 in the TDF group and −0.179 in the 
placebo group. Among the 15 subjects who received TDF for 96 weeks, the mean (SD) total body BMD Z-
score had decreased by −0.403.  
By Week 336, 13/81 (16.05%) in the All TDF group had decreases from baseline of > 4% in spine and/or 
total body BMD at ≥ 1 time points. Decreases > 4% were persistent in 5/13 subjects. Also, 3/13 had low 
BMD at any visit (spine or total body unadjusted Z-score ≤  −2.0). 
The overall picture in these HIV-infected adolescents points to a slightly greater effect of TDF over 48 
weeks and a negative effect over time that cannot be put into context due to lack of a longstanding 
control group.  
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 36/55 
 
  
  
  
 
In GS-US-236-0112, with no control group, the percentages of subjects with ≥  4% decrease from 
baseline in spine BMD were 10/47 (21.3%) at Week 24 and 7/46 (15.2%) at Week 48 (6 had ≥  4% 
decrease at both Weeks 24 and 48). Similar decreases on TBLH were observed in 1/49 (2.0%) at Week 
24 and 2/48 (4.2%) at Week 48 (1 had ≥  4% decrease at both Weeks 24 and 48). Five of the 50 
subjects showed a worsening from baseline (change from > −2 to ≤  −2) in their spine and/or TBLH 
height-age BMD Z-scores at Week 24 and/or Week 48. The picture is compatible with the conclusion 
above but there is no control group. 
In Study ATN 110, in male subjects aged 18-22 years, the median BMD decreased over 24 weeks in the 
hip (−0.44%), spine (−0.23%) and whole body (−0.61%). Median BMD also decreased from baseline at 
Week 48 in the hip and whole body (approximately −1.0% and −0.7%, respectively; p < 0.001 for the 
change from baseline), but increased in the spine (approximately 0.4%). Decreases from baseline in all 
Z-scores were small but statistically significant at Weeks 24 and 48 (median absolute change from 
baseline at Week 24: spine approximately −0.08, hip approximately −0.02 [p = 0.02], whole body 
approximately −0.09; at Week 48: spine approximately −0.10, hip approximately −0.04, whole body 
approximately −0.10; p < 0.001 for all other parameters at both time points). Bone loss in participants 
with TFV-DP in the range considered to be highly protective in adults (> 700 fmol/punch) was 
significantly greater than in those with drug levels below the limit of quantitation. 
Within the limitation of the ATN 113 study there are no new safety concerns raised. 
The MAH has concluded that the impact of TDF on BMD is less in uninfected adults and young adults 
compared with infected adults and proposes that by extrapolation there will be a lesser effect in HIV-
uninfected adolescents vs. infected adolescents and adults. However the CHMP considered that this 
supposition cannot be concluded from available data. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As was the case in the adult PrEP studies, there were no confirmed and clear cases of PT or Fanconi’s 
syndrome in the small number of adolescents exposed to TDF in clinical trials for treatment or for PrEP. In 
uninfected adolescents total TDF consumption was limited to 48 weeks and adherence was poor, so that 
exposure was lower than likely occurred in HIV-infected adolescents.  
The available data in infected adolescents and uninfected adult males do suggest some negative effects of 
TDF on bone. It is not possible to compare the data with those previously described for adult HIV-1 
infected males and therefore the MAH’s conclusion that the effects are lesser in adolescents vs. adults 
cannot be supported. Furthermore, some adolescents who commence PrEP may choose to persist with 
intermittent usage into adulthood with unknown implications for long-term effects. 
The TVD SmPC already warns about the renal and bone effects of TFV but this is in the context of the 
considerable efficacy that has been demonstrated for TVD-containing regimens in HIV-1 infected persons. 
The risk in uninfected adolescents cannot be quantified from the available data.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC and the Truvada 
Package Leaflet warn that Truvada should only be taken 
as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy and 
that individuals should be counselled at frequent 
intervals to strictly adhere to the recommended 
Truvada daily dosing schedule. 
Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC and the Truvada 
Package Leaflet warn that Truvada should only be used in 
individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative prior to initiating and 
routinely while taking Truvada for PrEP. 
Renal toxicity (TDF)  Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC provides guidance on 
calculating creatinine clearance at baseline and the regular 
monitoring of renal function during Truvada use. In individuals 
at risk for renal impairment, more frequent monitoring of 
renal function is required. Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC 
states that use of Truvada should be avoided with concurrent 
or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products and that if 
concomitant use of Truvada and nephrotoxic agents is 
unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that cases of acute 
renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDS 
have been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with 
Truvada and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. If 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is coadministered with an 
NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that the potential 
risks and benefits associated with coadministration of 
LDV/SOF or SOF/VEL with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate given 
in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. 
atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in 
patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction, and that

Routine Risk Minimization Measures 
patients receiving LDV/SOF or SOF/VEL concomitantly with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease 
inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Section 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC provides guidance that 
coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with 
LDV/SOF and atazanavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir 
should be used with caution with frequent renal monitoring if 
other alternatives are not available, and that when LDV/SOF is 
coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 
dolutegravir , efavirenz or rilpivirine no dose adjustment is 
recommended but renal function should be closely monitored. 
Section 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC provides guidance on the 
coadministration of tenofovir DF with SOF/VEL. 
Section 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC provides information on 
interactions due to elimination of FTC and TDF by the kidneys 
and provides recommendations against the use of Truvada 
with nephrotoxic medications. 
Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC recommends monitoring of 
renal function as Truvada may cause renal damage. 
Renal ADRs associated with the TDF component of Truvada 
are provided in Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC. 
Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC states that proximal renal 
tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate discontinuation. Individuals at risk of renal 
impairment (such as individuals with baseline renal risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease, or individuals receiving 
concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of 
experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation. Adults 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada should 
only be used in individuals with creatinine clearance below 
80 mL/min if the potential benefits of treatment are 
considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
For treament of HIV-1 infection: 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC also contains 
recommendations on dosing in mild renal impairment (Cl cr 
50-80 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30-49 
mL/min) and states that Truvada is not recommended for 
patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
<30 mL/min) and patients who require hemodialysis. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that a higher risk of 
renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir 
or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of 
renal function is required in these patients. In patients with 
renal risk factors, the coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully 
evaluated. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning 
statement that renal function should be re-evaluated within a 
week should serum phosphate decrease < 1.5 mg/dL, or 
creatinine clearance decrease to < 50 mL/min in any patient 
receiving Truvada. Consideration should be given to 
interrupting treatment with Truvada in patients with creatinine 
clearance <50mL/min or decreases in serum phosphate to 
<1.0mg/dL (0.32mmol/L). Interrupting treatment with 
Truvada should also be considered in case of progressive 
decline of renal function when no other cause has been 
identified.

Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a recommendation 
that dose interval adjustments for HIV-1 patients with 
creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min should be made. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning that a 
careful benefit-risk assessment is needed when Truvada is 
used in patients with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and 
that renal function should be closely monitored. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning that the 
clinical response to treatment should be closely monitored in 
patients receiving Truvada at a prolonged dosing interval. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or on dialysis as the 
appropriate dose adjustments cannot be achieved with the 
combination tablet. 
For PrEP: 
Section 4.2 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that 
Truvada has not been studied in HIV-1 uninfected 
individuals with creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min and 
is therefore not recommended for use in this 
population. Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC also 
contains a warning statement that renal function should 
be re-evaluated within a week should serum phosphate 
decrease < 1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance decrease 
to < 60 mL/min in any individual receiving Truvada. 
Consideration should be given to interrupting use of 
Truvada in individuals with creatinine clearance 
< 60mL/min or decreases in serum phposphate to 
<1.0mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L). Interrupting use of Truvada 
should also be considered in case of progressive decline 
of renal function when no other cause has been 
identified. 
Pediatrics, for the HIV-1 treatment and for PrEP; 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC include a 
statement indicating that use of Truvada is not 
recommended in individuals under the age of 18 years 
with renal impairment. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that renal adverse 
reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have 
been reported in HIV-1 infected pediatric patients aged 2 to 
<12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC recommends 
monitoring renal function (creatinine clearance and 
serum phosphate) as recommended for adults. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC recommends to 
measure serum potassium and blood and urine glucose 
levels in any pediatric patient within one week if serum 
phosphate is < 3.0mg/dL (0.96 mmol/L); consultation 
with a nephrologist should be obtained to consider 
interruption of treatment if renal abnormalities are 
suspected or detected. Interrupting treatment with 
Truvada should also be considered in case of 
progressive decline of renal function when no other 
cause has been identified. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC recommends that, 
when Truvada is prescribed for PrEP, the individual 
should be reassessed at each visit to ascertain whether 
they remain at high risk of HIV-1 infection and that the 
risk of HIV-1 infection should be balanced against the

Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC warns about loss of BMD 
associated with TDF and that more pronounced decreases in 
BMD were seen in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease 
inhibitor and provides guidance that alternative treatment 
regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis 
that are at a high risk for fractures. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC provide a 
description of bone events associated with TDF-associated 
proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC recommends that if bone 
abnormalities are detected or suspected in pediatric patients, 
consultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist 
should be obtained. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC recommends that, 
when Truvada is prescribed for PrEP, the individual

Missing Information 
Safety in children 
(including long-term 
safety) (TDF) 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC notes that the safety and 
efficacy of Truvada has not been established in children 
< 12 years old. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that there are 
uncertainties associated with the long term renal and 
bone effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
pediatric population during the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that there are 
no data on the long-term renal and bone effects of 
Truvada when used for PrEP in uninfected adolescents 
and the reversibility of renal toxicity after cessation of 
TDF for treatment of HIV-1 or Truvada for pre-exposure 
prophylaxis cannot be fully ascertained. 
Safety in elderly 
patients (FTC, TDF) 
Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC note that Truvada

Safety in pregnancy 
(FTC, TDF) 
Section 4.6 of the Truvada SmPC provides information on 
pregnancy in humans for the FTC and TDF components and in 
animals for all components of Truvada and notes that Truvada 
may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. 
Safety in lactation 
(FTC, TDF) 
Section 4.6 of the Truvada SmPC provides information on 
secretion of FTC and TDF in human milk and notes that 
Truvada should not be used during breastfeeding. 
Safety in patients 
with renal 
impairment (TDF) 
Adults 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada should 
only be used in individuals with creatinine clearance below 
80 mL/min if the potential benefits are considered to 
outweight the potential risks. 
For treatment of HIV-1 infection 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada should 
only be used in HIV-1 infected patients with creatinine 
clearance below 80mL/min if the potential benefits are 
considered to outweight the potential risks. 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC states that limited data 
support once daily dosing of Truvada in patients with mild 
renal impairment (CL cr 50-80 mL/min). In patients with 
moderate renal impairment (CL cr 30-49 mL/min) Truvada 
every 48 hours is recommended but Truvada is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment 
(CL cr<30 mL/min) and patients who require hemodialysis. 
For PrEP 
Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada 
has not been studied in HIV-1 uninfected individuals with 
creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and is therefore not 
recommended for use in this population. 
Pediatrics 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC state 
that Truvada is not recommended in individuals under 
the age of 18 with renal impairment. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Study 2 (Extrapolation study to support the use of Truvada in 
combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually 
acquired HIV-1 infection in adolescents at high risk), which is contained in the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0294/2015 and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as 
significant.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Truvada is approved for use in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk in the EU, US and several 
other countries worldwide. There remains a need for additional methods of HIV prevention to further 
reduce new HIV infections, especially among adolescents. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Data from studies with FTC, TDF, and TVD in HIV-infected and uninfected subjects were provided. 
Exposure, efficacy, and safety data from TDF and/or FTC treated HIV-infected adults and adolescents, 
and from uninfected subjects receiving TVD for PrEP support extrapolation to high risk adolescents for the 
use of TVD in combination with safer sex practices for PrEP to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 
infection. In addition, this data is further supplemented by Study ATN-113 investigating TVD PrEP in HIV-
uninfected adolescents (aged 15 to 17 years). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The current application to extend the use of daily Truvada for PrEP from adults to adolescents is 
principally based on the adult PrEP studies that were previously assessed in II/126 and on a comparison 
of safety and PK between HIV-1-infected adolescents and adults dosed with FTC 200 mg and/or TDF 300 
mg QD as part of a complete ART regimen. There are minimal data available from the actual target 
population and these are confined to 79 adolescent males aged from 15-17 years, many of whom did not 
complete 48 weeks of treatment and had poor adherence.  
The iPrEx study was conducted in adult MSM (mean age ~27 years) and reported relative effectiveness of 
44% (mITT) and 47% (ITT) in the primary analysis. The lower bounds of the 95% CI were above zero 
but below the pre-defined cut-off of 30%. In mITT subjects reporting ≥90% pill adherence the relative 
efficacy was 73% (41%, 88%) and for those with quantifiable plasma or intracellular drug levels the 
relative efficacy was 92% (40%, 99%), even in those reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse 
(URAI). Thus, the efficacy of oral Truvada for PrEP depended on adherence. Adherence and efficacy were 
related to age, level of education and reporting URAI at screening. 
In the open label extension (OLE) phase the HIV incidence on PrEP was 53% (95% CI 26 to 70) lower 
than in the placebo group of the randomised phase (3.93 infections per 100 p-y) and 51% (95% CI 23 to 
69) lower than during the gap between the randomised phase and the OLE (3.81 infections per 100 p-y). 
HIV incidence was strongly inversely related to detection of TFV-DP in dried blood spots (DBS). 
The Partner’s PrEP study provided efficacy data in HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (mean age ~33 years) in 
which the index cases were not considered to be in need of HIV treatment at the time of study conduct. 
In the mITT population the HRs indicated a 67% reduction (95% CI: 44%–81%) in risk of HIV-1 
acquisition with TDF and a 75% reduction (95% CI: 55%–87%) in risk of HIV-1 acquisition with TVD. 
Overall, similar protective trends for TDF and FTC/TDF compared with placebo were observed in each 
sub-group including gender. Cases were much less likely than controls to have detectable TFV in plasma.  
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 46/55 
 
  
  
  
Those who had been assigned to placebo were offered re-randomisation (in a 1:1 ratio) to TDF or 
Truvada in a blinded fashion. In total, 52 infections occurred after randomisation in subjects taking active 
treatment, including 31 in the TDF arm (0.71 per 100 p-y) and 21 in the Truvada arm (0.48 per 100 p-y). 
The difference between these arms was not significant (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39–1.17; p=0.16). Having 
detectable plasma TFV was associated with an estimated relative risk reduction for acquiring HIV-1 of 
85% for TDF and 93% for Truvada. HIV-1 incidences in subjects receiving PrEP were similar before and 
after the DSMB intervened to stop the placebo group, in which the HIV-1 incidence was 2 per 100 p-y.  
Additional data came from the PROUD study in MSM with a mean age of 35 years. At the time when the 
steering committee recommended that all deferred treatment group participants should be offered PrEP, 
three HIV infections had occurred in the immediate treatment group (1.2/100 person-years) vs. 20 in the 
deferred group (9.0/100 person-years) despite 174 non-study prescriptions for PrEP in the deferred group 
(leaving 167 without prior use of PrEP). These results give a relative reduction of 86% (90% CI 64–96, 
p=0·0001) and an absolute difference of 7.8/100 person-years (90% CI 4.3–11.3). 
Based on plasma exposures to FTC and TFV when dosed (200 mg and 300 mg QD) to steady state, the 
efficacy of daily TVD for PrEP in male adolescents who have sex with other males can be expected to be 
the same as that previously described in older MSM provided that they have the same level of treatment 
adherence. Unfortunately, available evidence indicates that adherence in adolescents and adults aged 18-
22 years is lower than that in older adults and wanes rapidly, with implications for efficacy. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are two issues that are expected to negatively impact on the benefit of once daily Truvada for PrEP 
when it is used over longer periods than have been studied within formal clinical trial settings.  
The first is the potential for dwindling adherence to daily dosing, which has already been shown very 
clearly to impact on efficacy. The second is that taking an oral PrEP will prompt some individuals to 
engage in more risky behaviours, which could result in a higher rate of HIV seroconversion despite PrEP 
compared to the trial settings, especially if behavioural change is accompanied by dwindling adherence. 
In iPrEx and Partner’s PrEP the assessment of behavioural change suggested that being in a study without 
knowledge of treatment assignment reduced risky behaviours compared to subjects’ screening visit 
reports but this finding cannot be extrapolated to non-study settings or to adolescents. 
There are very few data available on the use of TVD for PrEP in adolescent males aged 15-17 years and in 
young adult males aged 18-22 years with a history of URAI. What data there are indicate lesser efficacy 
than was observed in the prior MSM studies. Poor efficacy was associated with a marked drop in 
adherence to treatment over time. Through 48 weeks of treatment with TVD for PrEP in adult males aged 
18-22 in ATN 110 the HIV incidence was 3.3 per 100 person-years. In the adolescents in ATN 113 the 
HIV seroconversion rate was 6.4 per 100 person-years. Thus, ATN 100 and 113 gave HIV seroconversion 
rates similar to or higher than the rate observed in the placebo group in the randomised phase of iPrEX 
(3.9 infections per 100 person-years). In reality, PrEP may be far less successful in subjects aged < 18 
years (or indeed in adults aged 18-22 years) compared to older adults simply due to poor adherence. 
There is a lack of information on PrEP in female teenagers. There is a suggestion from publications that 
adherence may be even more critical for women at risk of HIV-1 acquisition via the genital tract 
compared to men at risk from rectal transmission. Overall, the Partners PrEP study supported an 
association between high rates of adherence and high rates of efficacy among study participants of both 
sexes. Therefore similar levels of adherence in female adolescents should provide protection comparable 
to that observed in women in Partners PrEP but there are no fully reported and published data to support 
this assumption. One study (CHAMPS) has completed in S. Africa. Over the course of this 12-month study 
in 148 teenagers (98 female) adherence based on detectable plasma TFV waned from 57% at week 12 to 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 47/55 
 
  
  
  
38% at week 24 and 38% at study end but there was no gender-specific trend in adherence. One HIV 
seroconversion occurred (0.76/100 person-years) in a 19-year-old female who had stopped PrEP 24 
weeks prior to diagnosis. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of each of FTC and TDF, as well as that of Truvada, is very well known. When used for 
PrEP in HIV-1 uninfected adults the safety profile was much as expected based on the wealth of 
experience with this combination within complete ART regimens. There were lower rates of factors 
associated with renal abnormalities during TDF exposure (including higher age, lower CrCL, underlying 
diabetes and concomitant nephrotoxic agents) in adults suitable for PrEP vs. HIV-1 infected adults, which 
may explain why there were not major differences in renal markers between active and placebo groups in 
adult PrEP studies. 
Safety data on use of FTC and TDF in adolescents come mostly from small numbers of HIV-1 infected 
subjects enrolled in clinical trials. The available data suggest that the overall safety profile is similar to 
that in infected adults. There are very limited safety data available from ATN113 but there are several 
ongoing studies known to the MAH that are enrolling HIV uninfected teenagers. These trials should 
provide more safety information in the future. 
Whilst FTC is not without its safety issues, the main concern is the use of TVD in uninfected adolescents 
due to the renal and bone effects of TFV. 
Renal effects 
During the double-blind treatment period of Study GS-US-104-0321, 6 TDF (13.3%) and 4 placebo 
subjects (9.5%) reported at least one AE in the renal and urinary disorders SOC but none in the TDF 
group was considered related to study drug by the investigator. By Week 336, the he only renal AE 
reported for > 1 subject in the All TDF group was proteinuria in 2 subjects (2.5%). One subject had 
findings consistent with PRT although some of these resolved during continued therapy with TDF and 
treatment was continued. Reductions from baseline to Week 48 in eGFR were −11.00 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 
the TDF group and −5.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group and at Week 144 the median change 
from baseline was –38.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the All TDF group. The changes were considered to be 
consistent with normal changes in renal function in an adolescent population progressing towards 
adulthood but there was no control group after Week 48 to put the changes into context. 
In GS-US-236-0112, with cobicistat in the STB, there were expected initial increases in serum creatinine 
and decreases in eGFR that stabilised through Week 48. At baseline, 4/50 (8.0%) had proteinuria as 
assessed by dipstick analysis (all Grade 1). Post-baseline, Grade 1 or 2 proteinuria, generally isolated and 
transient, was reported for 22 subjects (44%; 15 Grade 1, 7 Grade 2). There was an increase in 
proteinuria as assessed by urine protein to creatinine ratio, an increase in urine retinol binding protein to 
creatinine ratio and a decrease in the urine beta-2-microglobulin to creatinine ratio. There were no 
reported cases of PRT or Fanconi syndrome. 
Bone effects 
Peak bone mass is generally achieved by 30 years of age, and 80% of peak bone mass is attained by age 
18 years. The greatest gains in bone mass at the spine and the hip occur between 11 and 14 years of age 
in girls and 13 and 17 years of age in boys. Adolescent subjects in Study GS-US-104-0321 were within 
the period of greatest gain and BMD increased. Over 48 weeks the differences between the TDF and 
placebo groups in the percentage change from baseline in spine or total body BMD were not statistically 
significant. Increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at Week 48 were 3.148% for TDF and 3.807% 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 48/55 
 
  
  
  
for placebo (p = 0.54). After the double-blind treatment period, the median percentage change for the All 
TDF group in spine BMD from baseline to Week 144 was 12.702% (n = 26).  
There were no clinically relevant changes in spine BMD Z-scores in either TDF or placebo group at Weeks 
24 or 48. After the double-blind treatment period, among the 28 subjects who received TDF for 96 weeks, 
a decrease in the spine BMD Z-score was observed (−0.341). Increases from baseline in total body BMD 
to Week 48 were 1.495% for TDF and 1.518% for placebo (p = 0.96). The median percentage change in 
total body BMD from baseline to Week 144 was 4.322%. At Week 48, the mean change in total bone BMD 
Z-score was −0.254 in the TDF group and −0.179 in the placebo group. Among the 15 subjects who 
received TDF for 96 weeks, the mean (SD) total body BMD Z-score had decreased by −0.403.  
By Week 336, 13/81 (16.05%) in the All TDF group had decreases from baseline of > 4% in spine and/or 
total body BMD at ≥1 time points. Decreases > 4% were persistent in 5/13 subjects. Also, 3/13 had low 
BMD at any visit (spine or total body unadjusted Z-score ≤ −2.0). 
In GS-US-236-0112, with no control group, the percentages of subjects with ≥ 4% decrease from 
baseline in spine BMD were 10/47 (21.3%) at Week 24 and 7/46 (15.2%) at Week 48 (6 had≥ 4% 
decrease at both Weeks 24 and 48). Similar decreases on TBLH were observed in 1/49 (2.0%) at Week 
24 and 2/48 (4.2%) at Week 48 (1 had ≥ 4% decrease at both Weeks 24 and 48). Five of the 50 subjects 
showed a worsening from baseline (change from > −2 to ≤ −2) in their spine and/or TBLH height-age 
BMD Z-scores at Week 24 and/or Week 48.  
The overall picture in these HIV-infected adolescents points to a slightly greater effect of TDF over 48 
weeks vs. placebo and a negative effect over time that cannot be put into context due to lack of a 
longstanding control group.  
In Study ATN 110, in HIV uninfected male subjects aged 18-22 years, the median BMD decreased over 24 
weeks in the hip (−0.44%), spine (−0.23%) and whole body (−0.61%). Median BMD also decreased from 
baseline at Week 48 in the hip and whole body (approximately −1.0% and −0.7%, respectively; p < 
0.001 for the change from baseline), but increased in the spine (approximately 0.4%). Decreases from 
baseline in all Z-scores were small but statistically significant at Weeks 24 and 48 (median absolute 
change from baseline at Week 24: spine approximately −0.08, hip approximately −0.02 [p = 0.02], 
whole body approximately −0.09; at Week 48: spine approximately −0.10, hip approximately −0.04, 
whole body approximately −0.10; p < 0.001 for all other parameters at both time points). Bone loss in 
participants with TFV-DP in the range considered to be highly protective in adults (> 700 fmol/punch) 
was significantly greater than in those with drug levels below the limit of quantitation. 
In Study ATN 113, in uninfected male subjects aged 15-17 years, baseline BMD was in the normal range 
for age, based on Z-scores. At week 48, results for 43 participants showed statistically significant 
increases from baseline in spine (median +2.6%, IQR 0.0-4.6, P<0.001), hip (+1.2%, IQR -0.9-4.3, 
P=0.02) and total body BMD (+0.7%, IQR -0.2-2.6, P<0.001). Z-scores in the hip and spine did not 
change significantly from baseline to week 48, but total body BMD Z-score decreased (-0.20, p<0.001).  
In adults and adolescents another important risk is that subjects could acquire HIV-1 despite PrEP and 
continue to expose the virus to Truvada until such time as the infection is discovered and a full ART 
regimen is commenced as necessary. This raises the risk of development of clinically important 
resistance. The SmPC already contains warnings on this issue but the apparent lower adherence and 
efficacy of PrEP in adolescents means that the risk of such occurrences can be expected to be greater. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In addition to the few and mostly uncontrolled safety data available in adolescents, plasma exposures to 
FTC and TFV were not determined in uninfected adolescents who received 200 mg FTC and 300 mg TDF 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 49/55 
 
  
  
  
QD for PrEP. Based on all the available data, it is reasonably expected that plasma exposures to FTC and 
TFV in HIV-uninfected adolescents will be slightly higher than those in uninfected adults at the same level 
of adherence to TVD for PrEP. This observation underlines the potential safety concerns regarding TFV 
effects on renal function and bone formation and maintenance, especially in adolescents who are pre-
pubertal and in those who have not completed their growth spurt. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out 
that plasma exposures may differ between genders, possibly being even greater in post-pubertal females 
compared to post-pubertal males. Unfortunately, there are insufficient data at this time to assess this 
possibility.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Truvada has been shown to provide some degree of protection against HIV-1 infection in treatment-
adherent adult persons who put themselves at risk due to their sexual practise. The degree of protection 
provided by PrEP has been repeatedly shown to be related to the level of adherence, supported by finding 
drug in plasma, although the minimum concentrations that are needed to provide protection have not 
been identified. Thus, if taken regularly, Truvada can be regarded as having a benefit in persons unwilling 
or unable to take adequate non-pharmacological and behavioural steps to prevent HIV-1 infection.  
Use of TVD from the age of 12 years is supported by efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. It can be agreed 
that if adherence were to be similar in adolescents as in the older subjects enrolled into iPrEX and 
EMA/10650/2018 
Page 50/55 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Partners’ PrEP then protection should be similar. However, the few data available indicate that adherence 
is poor and dwindles rapidly in male and female subjects aged < 18 years. Indeed, this seems to apply 
even in male subjects aged 18-22 years. Thus, the benefit of prescribing TVD to adolescents appears very 
likely to be less than that achievable in motivated adults.  
There are no clinical data on PrEP below 15 years of age. Based on plasma exposures to FTC and TFV 
when dosed (200 mg and 300 mg QD) to steady state, the efficacy of daily TVD for PrEP in male 
adolescents who have sex with other males can be expected to be the same as that previously described 
in older MSM provided that they have the same level of treatment adherence. Subjects aged 12-15 years 
could be even more vulnerable to the considerations that were reported to lead to poor adherence in 
older subjects.  
As was the case in the adult PrEP studies, there were no confirmed and clear cases of PT or Fanconi’s 
syndrome in the small number of adolescents exposed to TDF in clinical trials for treatment. In uninfected 
adolescents, total TDF consumption was limited to 48 weeks and adherence was poor, so that exposure 
was lower than likely occurred in HIV-infected adolescents.  
The available data in HIV-1 infected adolescents and in uninfected adult males do suggest some negative 
effects of TDF on bone tissue. It is not possible to directly compare the data between uninfected 
adolescents and adults. The MAH’s conclusion that the effects are lesser in adolescents vs. adults cannot 
be supported by available data. 
The TVD SmPC already warns about the renal and bone effects of TVF but this is in the context of the 
considerable efficacy that has been demonstrated for TVD-containing regimens in HIV-1 infected persons.  
The benefit-risk relationship when Truvada is used for treatment vs. prophylaxis in adolescents rests on 
two problems: firstly the risk in uninfected adolescents cannot be quantified from the available data and 
secondly the benefit that may be expected is not known but can be expected to be substantially lower 
compared to adults due to differences in adherence levels. Finally, the benefit-risk relationship must 
consider that the proposed usage is in subjects in whom HIV-1 infection could be prevented if appropriate 
non-pharmacological measures were to be adequately and consistently employed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ultimately, since it has been concluded that oral PrEP with Truvada is effective if it is taken, it is for 
subjects and their physicians to discuss to what extent adequate non-pharmacological preventive 
measures will be applied and to weigh up the benefit of the additional protection that may be afforded by 
daily oral prophylaxis with TVD against the risks of renal and bone effects as well as the more minor side 
effects that can occur. Truvada can be used for PrEP in adolescents.  
The MAH committed to set up a PrEP registry to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk minimization 
materials. The establishment of the PrEP Registry is expected to enable monitoring of outcome measures 
such as seroconversion rates and renal/ bone effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Truvada is positive.

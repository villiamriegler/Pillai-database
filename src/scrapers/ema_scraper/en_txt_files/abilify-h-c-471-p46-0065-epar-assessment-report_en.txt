ASSESSMENT 
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
results of the final clinical study report (CSR) for Study CN138603.1 
Study CN138603 was a United States Food and Drug Administration post-approval commitment designed 
to assess whether paediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment for 
their  symptoms  of  irritability  associated  with  autistic  disorder  would  experience  a  relapse  significantly 
later when continuing therapy with aripiprazole than subjects treated with placebo. 
Methodology 
This  was  a  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  study  with  2  parallel  treatment 
groups designed to assess the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the long-term maintenance treatment of 
pediatric subjects with irritability associated with autistic disorder. The study included 2 phases: Phase 1 
(stabilization  phase)  -  13  -  26  weeks  of  single-blind  aripiprazole  treatment  and  Phase  2  (randomization 
phase) - 16 weeks of double-blind treatment with aripiprazole or placebo. 
The study design is presented graphically in Figure below: 
The  population  included  male  or  female  subjects  6  to  17  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  baseline  visit 
meeting  DSM-IV-TR  diagnostic  criteria  for  autistic  disorder  and  demonstrating  behaviors  such  as 
tantrums,  aggression,  self-injurious  behavior,  or  a  combination  of  these  problems.  The  diagnosis  of 
autistic disorder was to be confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Subjects were to have 
Clinical Global Impressions-Severity( CGI-S) scores ≥ 4 AND an Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability 
(ABC-I) Subscale score ≥ 18 at the screening and baseline visits and to have a mental age of at least 24 
months, as assessed by the investigators. A total of 215 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 157 (73%) 
completed  the  screening  phase  and  entered  Phase  1.  Eighty-five  subjects  (54%)  completed  Phase  1  and 
were randomized in Phase 2 (41 and 44 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively). 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  compared  with  placebo  to  prevent 
relapses in pediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment for their 
symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder as measured by the time from randomization to 
relapse. 
Secondary objectives of the study were:

•  To  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  aripiprazole  on  the  mean  change  from  end  of  Phase  1  to 
endpoint on the Irritability subscale of the ABC-I score 
•  To  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  aripiprazole  on  the  mean  Clinical  Global  Impressions-
Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score at endpoint 
Statistical Considerations 
The analysis populations included the following: 
•  The Enrolled Sample comprised all subjects who signed informed consent. 
•  The  Phase  1  Safety  Sample  comprised  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  single-blind 
aripiprazole in Phase 1 (Stabilization Phase), as indicated on the study therapy form.  
•  The Phase 1 Efficacy Sample comprised all subjects who were in the Phase 1 Safety Sample and 
had at least 1 efficacy evaluation after the start of Phase 1 study drug. 
•  The Randomized Sample comprised all subjects who were randomized in Phase 2 (Randomization 
Phase). 
•  The Phase 2 Safety Sample comprised all subjects in the Randomized Sample who took at least 1 
dose of double-blind medication in Phase 2, as indicated on the study therapy form. 
•  The Phase 2 Efficacy Sample comprised all subjects who were in the Phase 2 Safety Sample and 
had at least 1 efficacy evaluation after the start of Phase 2 study drug. 
Analysis Data Sets: 
•  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) data set included data recorded at a given visit or, if 
no observation was recorded at that visit, data carried forward from the previous visit. 
•  Baseline data of either Phase 1 or Phase 2 was not carried forward or averaged with on treatment 
data to impute missing values for the LOCF data set. 
•  The Observed Case (OC) data set consisted of the actual observation at each visit. 
The LOCF data set was the primary data set. The analyses of the OC data set were considered secondary, 
and were performed to corroborate those analyses on the LOCF data set. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the time from randomization to relapse. A total of 30 relapses 
would  have  provided  80%  power  to  detect  a  significant  difference  in  time  to  relapse  between  the  2 
treatment groups using the log-rank test. This assumed a relapse rate of 25% in the aripiprazole group, a 
relapse rate of 55% in the placebo group, and a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The hazard ratio for these assumed relapse rates was 0.36. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure above was evaluated by a survival analysis using the Randomized 
Sample.  The survivorship function and estimated survivorship curves were obtained from Kaplan-Meier 
estimates. Survival distributions of the 2 treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test, stratified 
by  baseline  body  weight  (2  categories:  ≥  40  kg  and  <  40  kg).  The  estimated  hazard  ratio  and  95% 
confidence  interval  (CI)  was  obtained  from  the  Cox  regression  model,  with  baseline  body  weight  (2 
categories: ≥ 40 kg and < 40 kg) as a stratification factor and with treatment group as a covariate. 
The secondary outcome measures were mean change from baseline (end of Phase 1) to Week 16 endpoint 
(LOCF)  in  the  ABC-I,  and  mean  CGI-I  score  at  Week  16  endpoint  (LOCF).  The  mean  change  from 
baseline in the Irritability Subscale score was evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
that included the end of Phase 1 Irritability score as covariate, and treatment and baseline body weight (2 
categories: ≥ 40 kg and < 40 kg) as main effects. 
The  mean  CGI-I  score  was  evaluated  using  an  ANCOVA  model,  with  CGI-S  end  of  Phase  1  score  as 
covariate and treatment and baseline body weight (2 categories: ≥ 40 kg and < 40 kg) as main effects. 
Analysis  of  the  secondary  efficacy  measures  was  performed  on  the  Phase  2  Efficacy  Sample,  and  was 
repeated utilizing the OC data set. 
For the analysis of the secondary outcome measures, a hierarchical testing procedure was used in order for 
the overall experiment-wise type I error rate to be kept at ≤ 0.05.

A  total  of  215  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study,  and  157  (73%)  completed  the  screening  phase  and 
entered  Phase  1  (Table  below).  Eighty-five  subjects  (54%)  completed  Phase  1  and  were  randomized  in 
Phase 2 (41 and 44 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively). 
Overall, 54% and 43% of aripiprazole and placebo subjects, respectively, completed Phase 2, and the most 
common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy in both treatment groups. 
Demographics 
Demographic characteristics for the randomized sample were comparable across treatment groups (Table 
4.3-1). The majority of subjects were male and White, and the median age was 10 years. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
In the Phase 1 safety sample, 81.3% of subjects were ≤ 12 years of age, 79.4% were male, and 69.0% were 
White. 
Psychiatric  evaluation  of  the  randomized  sample:  at  baseline,  overall  mean  ABC  Irritability, 
Hyperactivity,  Stereotypy,  Social  Withdrawal,  and  Inappropriate  Speech  Scores  appeared  to  be  slightly 
higher  in  the  aripiprazole  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Mean  CGI-S  Scores  were  similar  in  both 
groups. In the Randomization Sample, the mean (median) time in stabilization was 135.0 (129.0) days and 
125.3 (125.5) days in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively:

Exposure 
The  number  of  subjects  in  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample  receiving  double-blind  study  medication  and  the 
mean  and  range  of  the  weekly  mean  daily  dose  is  summarized  in  Table  4.4.  For  aripiprazole-treated 
subjects, the mean weekly daily dose ranged from 8.9 to 10.5 mg/day. The mean daily dose of aripiprazole 
ranged from 2.0 to 15.0 mg/day. 
The  mean  and  range  of  the  weekly  mean  daily  dose  of  aripiprazole  for  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample  are 
summarized in Table S.4.2 of the CN138603 final CSR1. The mean daily dose of aripiprazole ranged from 
2.1 to 12.5 mg/day.

Efficacy Results 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  (p  =  0.097)  between  aripiprazole  and  placebo  for  the 
primary endpoint (time from randomization to relapse) (Randomized Sample). The Kaplan-Meier relapse 
rates  at  Week  16  were  32%  for  aripiprazole  and  50%  for  placebo  (hazard  ratio  of  0.57;  95%  CI:  0.28, 
1.12). 
The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy 
Sample) was 5.2 and 9.6 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -4.4; 
95% CI: -8.8, 0.0). The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (OC data set, 
Phase 2 efficacy sample) was improved in the aripiprazole group (-1.0) compared with the placebo group 
(3.6) (treatment difference of -4.55; 95% CI: -8.62, -0.48). The mean endpoint, CGI-I Score at Week 16 
(LOCF  data  set,  Phase  2  Efficacy  Sample),  was  4.2  and  4.8  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively (treatment difference of -0.6; 95% CI: -1.3, 0.1). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  (p  =  0.097)  between  aripiprazole  and  placebo  for  the 
primary endpoint (time from randomization to relapse) (randomized sample) (Figure 4.5 below and Figure 
S.5.1 and Table S.5.1 of the CN138603 final CSR). The Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at Week 16 were 32% 
for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo (hazard ratio of 0.57; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.12).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
ABC Irritability (ABC-I) Subscale Scores 
The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy 
Sample) was 5.2 and 9.6 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -4.4; 
95% CI: -8.8, 0.0). The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (OC data set, 
Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was improved in the aripiprazole group (-1.0) compared with the placebo group 
(3.6)  (treatment  difference  of  -4.55;  95%  CI:  -8.62,  -0.48).  The  median  change  from  baseline  in  ABC-I 
Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was improved in the aripiprazole 
group  (2.0)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (10.0)  (95%  CI:  0.0,  10.0).  At  Phase  1  endpoint,  the 
unadjusted mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score (OC data set, Phase 1 Efficacy Sample) 
was improved (-15.5). 
Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Score 
The mean endpoint, CGI-I Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample), was 4.2 and 4.8 
in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -0.6; 95% CI: -1.3, 0.1). At 
the Phase 1 endpoint, the unadjusted mean CGI-I Score (LOCF data set, Phase  1 Efficacy Sample) was 
2.1.  
Additional Efficacy Endpoints 
Time from Randomization to Relapse by Subgroups: The Cox proportional hazards model relapse rates at 
Week 16 for subjects ≤ 12 years were 37.5% and 48.5% for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively (hazard 
ratio  of  0.68;  95%  CI:  0.32,  1.43)  (Table  S.5.6  of  the  CN138603  final  CSR1).  The  Cox  proportional

hazards  model  relapse  rates  at  Week  16  for  subjects  >  12  years  were  11.1%  (1  subject)  and  54.5%  for 
aripiprazole and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio of 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.51). 
SAFETY 
No deaths were reported in this study. 
Phase 2 Safety Sample 
No  subjects  had  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  One  subject  had  an  adverse  event  (AE)  that  started  in 
Phase  1  and  was  randomized  in  error  in  Phase  2;  this  subject  did  not  receive  treatment  in  Phase  2.  No 
treated subjects discontinued due to AEs. 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was higher in the aripiprazole group (56.4%) than in the 
placebo group (32.6%). 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  in  ≥  5%  of  subjects  in  either  the  aripiprazole  or  placebo  groups  were  upper 
respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs 2.3%), constipation and movement disorder (5.1% each vs 0% each), 
and vomiting (5.1% vs 4.7%). 
Three subjects (7.7%) in the aripiprazole group had treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptom (EPS)-
related  AEs  (movement  disorder  in  2  subjects  and  akathisia,  extrapyramidal  disorder,  and  tremor  in  1 
subject each). In the placebo group, 3 subjects (7.0%) had treatment-emergent EPS-related AEs (akathisia, 
muscle twitching, and tremor in 1 subject each). 
The  median  changes  from  baseline  in  laboratory  values  to  endpoint  were  generally  similar  between  the 
aripiprazole and placebo groups; however, numerical differences were observed for relative eosinophils, 
creatine kinase, prolactin, and uric acid. Few clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed, 
except for non-fasting triglycerides and combined triglycerides: there were potentially significant changes 
in 6/20 in placebo (withdrawal) and 10/17 in aripiprazole group. 
Median change for non fasting triglycerides values were -7.0 mg/dL in the placebo (withdrawal group) vs 
2.0 mg/dL in the aripiprazole group. Median change for combined triglycerides values were 7.0 mg/dL in

group.
The adjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin (OC data set and Week 16 LOCF) was -0.2 
and 4.6 ng/mL in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively. 
The median changes from baseline in vital signs to endpoint were similar in both treatment groups. Few 
potentially  clinically  relevant  vital  sign  abnormalities  were  observed,  except  for  a  decrease  in  supine 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and a decrease in standing DBP. The adjusted mean change from baseline 
to  Week  16  (LOCF)  in  weight  was  significantly  greater  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (2.2  kg)  than  in  the 
placebo group (0.6 kg). Only 2 subjects (both in the placebo group) had relevant weight loss. 
Phase 1 Safety Sample 
One subject had an SAE (aggression) that was not considered related to aripiprazole by the investigator. 
Thirteen  subjects  (8.4%)  had  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation;  the  only  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation 
reported in > 1 subject were aggression and weight increased (1.3% each). Eighty percent of subjects had 
treatment-emergent AEs, and the most common events were weight increased, somnolence, and vomiting. 
Twenty-seven  subjects  (17.4%)  had  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  AEs,  and  the  only  treatment-
emergent EPS-related AE reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was tremor (6.5%). 
Few  clinically  relevant  laboratory  abnormalities  were  observed,  except  for  non-fasting  triglycerides  and 
combined  triglycerides,  which  have  changed  from  a)  nonfasting:  a  median  101  at  baseline  to  112  at

endpoint, and b) combined median 88 at baseline to 92 at endpoint: 
The  unadjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  serum  prolactin  at  endpoint  was  -4.7  ng/mL.  Potentially 
clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities observed in ≥ 10% of subjects were a decrease in sitting DBP, 
sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), standing SBP and DBP, and supine SBP and DBP and an increase in

sitting DBP. Mean and median changes from baseline to Week 26 in weight generally increased over time. 
Eleven  subjects  had  potentially  clinically  relevant  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  abnormalities  (sinus 
tachycardia in 3 subjects, ventricle premature beat in 1 subject, and other abnormalities in 7 subjects). 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
No subjects in the Phase 2 Safety Sample had SAEs. 
In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  1  subject  (CN138603-37-47)  had  Grade  3  aggression  that  was  not 
considered  related  to  aripiprazole  by  the  investigator.  Aripiprazole  was  discontinued,  and  the  event 
resolved with sequela. 
One enrolled subject (CN138603-1-2) had SAEs that started before or during the screening phase of the 
study  (Grade  3  worsening  of  aggression  and  Grade  3  delusions)  that  were  not  considered  related  to  the 
study drug by the investigator; the events resolved without treatment. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy 
One subject had an AE that started in Phase 1 and was randomized in error in Phase 2; this subject did not 
receive treatment in Phase 2. None of the treated subjects in the Phase 2 Safety Sample discontinued due 
to AEs. In the Phase 1 Safety Sample,  13 subjects (8.4%) had  AEs  that led to discontinuation. Adverse 
events that led to discontinuation reported in > 1 subject were aggression and weight increased (2 subjects 
[1.3%] each). No subjects discontinued due to AEs with onset before or during the screening phase. 
Overall Adverse Events 
In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  higher  in  the 
aripiprazole  group  (56.4%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (32.6%).  Treatment-emergent  AEs  in  ≥  5%  of 
subjects  in  either  the  aripiprazole  or  placebo  groups  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (10.3%  vs 
2.3%), constipation and movement disorder (5.1% each vs 0% each), and vomiting (5.1% vs 4.7%). 
In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, 80.0% of subjects had treatment-emergent AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs 
reported  in  ≥  5%  of  subjects  were  weight  increased  (25.2%),  somnolence  (14.8%),  vomiting  (14.2%), 
increased  appetite (12.9%), upper respiratory  tract infection (10.3%), fatigue and insomnia  (8.4% each), 
diarrhea  (7.1%),  tremor  (6.5%),  aggression  and  nasopharyngitis  (5.8%  each),  headache,  lethargy,  and 
pyrexia (5.2% each). 
Treatment-related Adverse Events 
In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  AEs  was  higher  in  the 
aripiprazole group (23.1%) than in the placebo group (14.0%). All treatment-related AEs were reported in 
< 5% of subjects in either treatment group (Table below). 
In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  59.4%  of  subjects  had  treatment-related  AEs.  Treatment-related  AEs 
reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were weight increased (23.9%), increased appetite and somnolence (12.9% 
each), fatigue (7.7%), tremor (6.5%), and insomnia (5.8%).

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Intensity 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the majority of treatment-emergent AEs were mild in intensity. No Grade 4 
treatment-emergent AEs were reported. Two subjects had Grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs (sinusitis in 1 
subject in the aripiprazole group and aggression and irritability in 1 subject in the placebo group). In the 
Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  majority  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  mild  in  intensity.  No  Grade  4 
treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported.  Six  subjects  had  Grade  3  treatment-emergent  AEs  (weight 
increased in 4 subjects and aggression in 2 subjects). 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events During Phase 2 by Subgroup 
By Gender 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was lower in male subjects 
in  the  aripiprazole  group  (42.9%)  than  in  female  subjects  (90.9%).  In  the  placebo  group,  the  overall 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar in male and female (32.4% and 33.3%, respectively).

By Age 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was greater in 
subjects > 12 years in the aripiprazole group (62.5%) than in subjects „T 12 years (54.8%). In the placebo 
group, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was also greater in subjects > 12 years (36.4%) 
than in subjects ≤ 12 years (31.3%). 
By Race 
In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  greater  in  White 
subjects in the aripiprazole group (62.1%) than in non-White subjects (40.0%). In the placebo group, the 
overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  also  greater  in  White  subjects  (35.7%)  than  in  non-
White subjects (26.7%). 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  median  changes  from  baseline  in  laboratory  values  to  endpoint  were 
generally  similar  between  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups;  however,  differences  were  observed  for 
relative  eosinophils,  creatine  kinase,  prolactin,  and  uric  acid.  Few  clinically  relevant  laboratory 
abnormalities were observed, except for non-fasting triglycerides and combined triglycerides. In the Phase 
2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin (OC data set and Week 16 
LOCF) was -0.2 and 4.6 ng/mL in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference 
of -4.81; CI: -6.77, -2.85). 
In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  median  changes  from  baseline  in  laboratory  values  to  endpoint  are 
summarized  in  Table  S.7.6.  Few  clinically  relevant  laboratory  abnormalities  were  observed,  except  for 
non-fasting triglycerides (32.3%) and combined triglycerides (23.1%). 
In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin at endpoint 
was -4.7 ng/mL. 
Electrocardiograms 
In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the mean change from baseline in ECG parameters is summarized in Table

“Other abnormalities” meant single visit abnormalities as stated: pt 15-121: prolonged QTcB: 439 msec; 
pt 21-18: prolonged QTcB 448; pt 21-10: QTcF increased >10% (from 370 to 409); pt 21-103: prolonged 
QTcB:  439;  pt  43-13:  prolonged  QTcB:  436;  pt  43-70:  prolonged  QTcB:  445;  pt  51-145:  prolonged 
QTcB: 438 and 1st AV block (PR 170 msec). 
Vital Signs and Physical Findings 
Vital Signs 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the median changes from baseline in vital signs to endpoint were similar in 
both treatment groups. Few potentially clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities were observed, except 
for a decrease in supine DBP (15.6% and 16.7% in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively) and 
a decrease in standing DBP (13.5% and 12.2% in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively). In the 
Phase 1  Safety Sample, the  median changes from baseline in  vital signs to Week  26  are  summarized in 
Table S.7.17 of the CN138603 final CSR1. Potentially clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities observed 
in ≥10% of subjects were a decrease in sitting DBP (53.5%), a decrease in sitting SBP (46.5%), a decrease 
in standing SBP and DBP (20.4% each), a decrease in supine SBP and DBP (17.4% each), and an increase 
in sitting DBP (11.6%). 
Physical Examination Findings 
In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  no  differences  in  height  were  observed  between  the  aripiprazole  and 
placebo groups. The change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at Week 16 was significantly greater 
in the aripiprazole group than in the placebo group across all analyses, except for the median percentile 
change in BMI. 
In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  26  in  height  varied 
slightly  over  time.  An  may  reflect  the  challenges  of  securing  subject  cooperation  with  a  height 
measurement  in  this  patient  population.  Mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  26  in  BMI 
varied slightly over time. 
Tanner Staging 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the number of subjects who advanced a Tanner stage for pubic hair was 3 
and 4 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively. The number of subjects who advanced a Tanner 
stage for breast/genitals was 5 and 4 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively. In the Phase 1

Safety  Sample,  24  and  21  subjects  advanced  a  Tanner  stage  for  pubic  hair  and  breast/genitals, 
respectively. 
Other Observations Related to Safety 
Weight Increase or Loss 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 16 (LOCF) in 
weight z-score was significantly greater in the aripiprazole group (0.1 kg) than in the placebo 
group (-0.0 kg) (treatment difference of 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.24): 
Phase  1  Safety  Sample  mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  26  in  weight  are  summarized

Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS)-related Side Effects 
EPS-related  side  effects  of  dyskinesias,  akathisia,  parkinsonism,  and  other  unwanted  effects  of 
psychotropics were evaluated with the following standardized and generally recognized scales: Abnormal 
Involuntary  Movement  Scale  (AIMS),2  Barnes  Akathisia  Rating  Scale  (BARS),3  and  Simpson  Angus 
Scale (SAS).4 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, 3 subjects (7.7%) in the aripiprazole group had treatment-emergent EPS-
related  AEs  (movement  disorder  in  2  subjects  and  akathisia,  extrapyramidal  disorder,  and  tremor  in  1 
subject each). In the placebo group, 3 subjects (7.0%) had treatment-emergent EPS-related AEs (akathisia, 
muscle twitching, and tremor in 1 subject each):

In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  27  subjects  (17.4%)  had  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  AEs.  The  only 
treatment-emergent EPS-related AE reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was tremor (6.5%): 
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in AIMS Total Score to Week 16 
(OC  data  set  and  LOCF)  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (-0.1)  and  the  placebo  group  (0.1) 
(treatment difference of -0.15; 95% CI: -0.50, 0.19). In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean 
change from baseline in AIMS Total Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.4. 
Simpson Angus Scale (SAS)

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in SAS Score to Week 16 (OC data 
set and LOCF) was significantly greater in the aripiprazole group  (-0.3) than in the placebo group (0.0) 
(treatment difference of -0.37; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.00;). In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean 
change from baseline in SAS Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.4. 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BARS Score to Week 16 (OC 
data  set  and  LOCF)  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (-0.1)  and  the  placebo  group  (0.0)  (treatment 
difference  of  -0.10;  95%  CI:  -0.23,  -0.03).  In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  unadjusted  mean  change 
from baseline in BARS Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.1. 
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 
Aripiprazole did not achieve statistical significance vs placebo on the primary outcome measure, the time 
to relapse. The effect size observed was smaller than what was used to power the study. Similar findings 
were  observed  on  the  2  secondary  outcome  measures:  mean  change  from  baseline  (end  of  Phase  1)  to 
Week 16 endpoint (LOCF) in ABC-I score, and mean CGI-I score at Week 16 endpoint (LOCF). 
No SAEs or discontinuations of treatment due to AEs occurred during the randomized phase. AEs were as 
expected  with  aripiprazole  in  pediatric  subjects.  The  Week  16  LOCF  mean  change  in  weight  z-score 
during Phase 2 was -0.0 in the placebo group and 0.1 in the aripiprazole group. During Phase 2, median 
changes were small in both the aripiprazole and placebo groups on fasting total cholesterol, low density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides. 
BENEFITS AND RISKS CONCLUSIONS 
The results from Study CN138603 do not change the overall benefit/risk profile of aripiprazole. 
Assessment 
MAH has presented the final results of a randomised withdrawal study to assess safety / maintenance of 
efficacy  beyond  3  months  (12  weeks)  for  paediatric  patients  with  irritability  associated  with  autistic 
disorder with ages 6 to 17 years old, requested by FDA as a post approval commitment. 
Analysis of data do not raise particular concerns in efficacy beyond 12 weeks in the presented indication, 
although  some  tolerance  seem  to  develop.  Presented  efficacy  data  do  not  jeopardise  any  of  the  EU 
approved indications. 
Regarding safety, there were relevant adverse events occurring in paediatric population, both in frequency 
and in severity, as compared to the adult population, namely concerning weight gain and EPS.  
These  however  are  in  line  with  the  adverse  event  profile  observed  in  the  main  studies  which  led  to 
approval of the paediatric indications. 
Regarding the  cardiac  effects and  the  changes  in  QTc  since  there  was  at  least  a  case  with  QTc  increase 
above > 30 msec, the MAH should continue monitoring effects on ECG and cardiac AEs and present the 
data in the PSURs. 
The  drop  out  rate  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  and  /  or  adverse  events  is  very  high  (46%).  These  values 
however,  are  within  the  range  of  both  aripiprazole  in  other  indications  and  age  ranges  and  of  other 
antipsychotics in autism. During stabilization phase most patients / caregivers may withdraw their consent 
without further notice, and lack of efficacy vs intolerance cannot be disentangled. On the other hand, in 
phase  2,  when  caregivers  know  that  the  pt  may  be  under  placebo,  drop  out  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  is 
expected. Thus we would also not consider this high drop out rate as unexpected. 
The MAH has received the initial proposal of SmPC change where we proposed for Section 5.1: 
Where it reads: 
“Irritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2): 
Aripiprazole  was  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years  in  two  8-week,  placebo-controlled  trials  [one 
flexible-dose  (2-15  mg/day)  and  one  fixed-dose  (5,  10,  or  15  mg/day)]  and  in  one  52-week  open-label 
trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and increased 
by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. 
Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour

Checklist  Irritability  subscale.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  finding  has  not  been  established. 
The  safety  profile  included  weight  gain  and  changes  in  prolactin  levels.  The  duration  of  the  long-term 
safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in 
females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 
(86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 
1.6 kg for aripiprazole.”

Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  a  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  safety  study,  after  a  13-26  week 
stabilisation on aripiprazole 2-15 mg; after this period, patients were either maintained on aripiprazole or 
switched  to  placebo  for  further  16  weeks.  The  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole 
compared with placebo to prevent relapses in pediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks 
of aripiprazole treatment. Relapse rates at Week 16 were 32% for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo (non 
statistically significant difference).There was an increase in median weight of 2.5 Kg in the stabilisation 
phase  on  aripiprazole,  and  a  further  median  increase  on  aripiprazole  (1.5  Kg)  as  compared  to placebo 
(0.3  Kg)  in  the  second  phase  of  the  study.  Extrapyramidal  symptoms  were  also  reported  in  17%  of 
patients, with tremor totalling 6.5%.” 
The MAH has proposed the new version: 
Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years  in  a  placebo-controlled,  long-term 
maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable 
response  were  either  maintained  on  aripiprazole  or  switched  to  placebo  for  further  16  weeks.  Kaplan-
Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo and the hazard ratio for 
relapse  (aripiprazole/placebo)  was  0.57  (non-statistically  significant  difference).  In  this  growing 
paediatric population, the mean weight gain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole 
was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was 
observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were reported during the 
open  stabilisation  phase  in  17%  of  patients,  with  tremor  accounting  for  6.5%.  During  the  placebo 
substitution phase, extrapyramidal symptoms were equally reported in aripiprazole patients 3/39 (7.7%) 
and patients on placebo 3/43 (7.0%). 
Applicant’s Rationale for Changes: 
The Applicant is in agreement to amend SmPC section 5.1 with information on study CN138-603. 
Besides  some  editorial  changes  on  the  study  design,  the  Applicant  would  like  to  clarify  the  proposed 
modifications related to the primary endpoint: 
The relapse rates quoted of 32% for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo reported in the clinical study report 
(CSR)  synopsis  and  Efficacy  Results  and  Discussion  sections  of  the  CSR  were  mislabelled  as  Kaplan-
Meier  rates,  when  in  fact  they  are  the  simple  proportions  (Number  of  Events/Number  of  Patients)  from 
Table  S.5.1.  The  simple  proportions  are  not  adjusted  for  censoring  in  the  time  from  randomization  to 
relapse  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  actual  Kaplan-Meier  relapse  rates  are  estimated 
from the product-limit survival estimates at Week 16 from Table S.5.3. Kaplan-Meier rates are calculated 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/488884/2013  
Page 21/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as 1 minus the proportion of subjects not experiencing relapse, which works out to 35% for aripiprazole 
and  52%  for  placebo.  These  Kaplan-Meier  rates  reflect  the  impact  of  censored  observations  in  the 
estimates of probability of no relapse at a given point in time. 
With regard to the observed weight gain the Applicant would like to highlight that given the investigated 
age range (6-17 years) this is a growing paediatric population. 
Please note that the EPS rate (17%) reported during the open stabilisation phase corresponds to the overall 
randomised population and not just to the responder population from the subsequent double-blind placebo 
substitution phase. 
Assessors comments: 
It  makes  no  sense  to  repeat  the  sentence  Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years, 
because  it  is  previously  stated  above.  Moreover,  it  reports  to  this  special  autistic  population,  and  not 
children in any indication. The string “long term study” is acceptable, since it follows the Guideline for 
long  term  studies  in  schizophrenia  –  the  randomised  withdrawal  design  is  not  accompanied  by  a 
description of a minimal duration to be considered a long term study. 
The introduction “In this growing paediatric population” is compelling and induces readers to think that 
these children are growing and is therefore normal to put up 5,4 Kg within 32 to 40 weeks on aripiprazole 
treatment – and this is simply not the case. Therefore this must not be introduced. 
The wording regarding Kaplan Meyer curve analysis is accepted, but the timeframe of relapse should be 
highlighted. 
The sentence “During the placebo substitution phase, extrapyramidal symptoms were equally reported in 
aripiprazole patients 3/39 (7.7%) and patients on placebo 3/43 (7.0%)” may be misleading: in the second 
phase  there  was  a  selection  bias,  since  the  patients  that  had  significant  EPS  in  the  stabilisation  phase 
possibly did not continue to the substitution phase (there was a significant reduction in the sample from 
phase 1 to phase 2). Moreover, the 3 patients in each arm that constituted the 7.7 and 7.0% were described 
as “treatment emergent AEs”, meaning that these were “de novo” EPS, and not patients continuing from 
one phase to the other with EPS. Therefore we propose not to include this statement. 
In conclusion, it is proposed the text below: 
Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  a  placebo-controlled,  long-term  maintenance  trial.  After  a  13-26  week 
stabilisation  on  aripiprazole  (2-15  mg/day)  patients  with  a  stable  response  were  either  maintained  on 
aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 
35%  for  aripiprazole  and  52%  for  placebo;  the  hazard  ratio  for  relapse  within  16  weeks 
(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over the 
stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for 
aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. 
Extrapyramidal  symptoms  were  mainly  reported  during  the  stabilisation  phase  in  17%  of  patients,  with 
tremor accounting for 6.5%.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER 
ACTION IF REQUIRED 
This randomised withdrawal study for the study of maintenance of effect / possible rebound phenomena 
upon discontinuation of abilify in irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents 
ages 6 to 17 years old, requested by FDA as a post approval commitment did not raise new efficacy or 
safety concerns.

The  study  involved  a  population  and  indication  not  approved  in  Europe.  Although  no  new  safety  issues 
have  arisen  in  comparison  with  the  AE  profile  of  EU  approved  indications,  there  is  information  on 
Irritability associated with autistic disorder in the SPC that can be updated. 
Therefore a change to SPC is proposed. 
Regarding the cardiac effects and the changes in QTc since there was at least a case with QTc increase 
above > 30 msec, the MAH should continue monitoring effects on ECG and cardiac AEs and present the 
data in the PSURs. 
PAC No. P46-065 
Overall Conclusion: 
The  results  from  Study  CN138603  do  not  change  the  paediatric  or  the  overall  benefit/risk  profile  of 
aripiprazole. 
  PAC not fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled but further action required): 
As outcome of this assessment, the MAH is requested to update the Product Information as follows 
and to submit the corresponding variation by one month: 
Proposed changes to the SPC: 
Section 5.1: 
Where it reads: 
“Irritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2): 
Aripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one 
flexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label

by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. 
Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour 
Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. 
The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term 
safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in 
females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298

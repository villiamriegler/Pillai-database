1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Analyses from the THIN study showed that the mortality 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
rate appeared lower in the Suboxone user group than in 
of studies to the competent authority 
the buprenorphine and methadone user groups. Two 
comparative analyses were conducted using the cohort 
design with intention-to-treat approach and the nested 
case control design. Both analyses yielded consistent 
results that Suboxone was not found associated with any 
elevated risk for all-cause mortality in comparison to 
buprenorphine or methadone. Based on the current 
findings, no safety signal was detected for Suboxone. 
Therefore, no change to the product information is 
warranted.

SmPC, 
The group of nine (9) type II variations was submitted as 
Group of 8 type II variations: 
-  
Update to section 4.2 of the SmPC to add a 
clarification on withdrawal signs based on the 
literature. 
 -  
Update to sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC 
to add new or revised warning, respectively, on the 
risk of respiratory depression in non-opioid 
dependent individuals, children and pregnant 
women, supported by relevant pharmacovigilance 
data. 
-  
Update to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC, 
to strengthen existing warning on hepatic injury, 
supported by relevant pharmacovigilance data. 
-  
Update to sections 4.4 of the SmPC to 
Labelling and 
result from a pharmacovigilance audit conducted by the UK 
PL 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 
(MHRA) on 29-31 May and 19-20 July 2012, where it was 
identified that the EU Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) for Suboxone should be aligned with the current 
CCDS. 
The variations included proposed changes to the SmPC and 
the package leaflet, and the MAH took this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the QRD template version 9. Eight 
(8) of the variations were acceptable and the sections 4.2, 
4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9 of the SmPC were updated, and in 
particular: 
-  
a clarification was added on withdrawal signs based 
on the available literature data. 
 - 
a new or revised warning, respectively, on the risk 
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strengthen the warning related to the use of 
suboxone in patient with severe renal impairment, 
supported by literature reference. 
-  
Update to sections 4.4 of the SmPC to 
strengthen general warning relevant to the 
administration of opioids, supported by literature 
references. 
-  
Update to section 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on the interaction of suboxone with full 
opioid agonist supported by literature references. 
-  
Update to sections 4.5 and 4.9 of the SmPC 
to add information on the interaction of suboxone 
with Naltrexone, supported by relevant literature 
references. 
-  
Update to section 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on the interaction of suboxone and 
CYP3A4 inducers, supported by literature references. 
The PL was updated accordingly. 
The MAH took the opportunity to make minor 
editorial changes to the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the QRD template version 9.  
The requested group of variations proposed 
amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
of respiratory depression in non-opioid dependent 
individuals, children and pregnant women,  supported by 
relevant pharmacovigilance data was added.  
-   
strengthening of the existing warning on hepatic 
injury, supported by relevant pharmacovigilance data, was 
done. 
-  
the warning related to the use of suboxone in 
patient with severe renal impairment was strengthened. 
This is supported by literature reference. 
-  
The general warning relevant to the administration 
of opioids was strengthened, supported by literature 
references. 
-  
Additional information on the interaction of 
suboxone with full opioid agonist supported by literature 
references was introduced. 
-  
An update to the information on the interaction of 
suboxone with Naltrexone and CYP3A4 inducers was made, 
supported by relevant literature references. 
In addition, the CHMP considers the following variation not 
acceptable: 
-  
Update to section 4.8 of the SmPC, to reclassify 
‘injury’ and ‘heat stroke’ under the MedDRA SOC ‘drug 
withdrawal symptom’, to add adverse events observed in 
post-marketing settings in accordance with current 
pharmacovigilance data.

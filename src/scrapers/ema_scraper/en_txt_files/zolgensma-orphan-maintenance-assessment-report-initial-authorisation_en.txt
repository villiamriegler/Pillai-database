COMP opinion date (adoption via written 
1 April 2020 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion (orphan medicinal product 
designation) 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor AveXis EU, Ltd submitted on 24 February 2015 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing adeno-
associated viral vector serotype 9 containing the human SMN gene for treatment of spinal muscular 
atrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of 
Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing adeno-associated viral 
vector serotype 9 containing the human SMN gene was considered justified based on preclinical 
data in a valid in vivo model of the condition, where administration of the product resulted in 
expression of the missing protein and improved motor function and survival; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to muscle wasting, weakness, 
failure to thrive, pulmonary and orthopaedic complications; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 containing 
the human SMN gene as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of spinal 
muscular atrophy.

Condition 
Spinal muscular atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease manifesting with progressive alpha motor 
neuron degeneration and subsequent muscle atrophy. In approximately 95% of cases it is caused by 
the deletion, -mutation or conversion of the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q and is inherited as an 
autosomal recessive disease. SMN1 produces the Survival Motor Neuron protein, which role is 
multifactorial and still incompletely understood. One of the most studied functions is assembly of small 
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which is mediated through a complex of several proteins 
including Gemin2-8 and unrip (Arnold et al 2015, Muscle Nerve 51:157-167, Howell et al. Future Med 
Chem. 2014 Jun; 6(9): 1081–1099.).   
SMN protein is found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus and has been identified in structures 
called “Gemini of coiled bodies” or simply “gems”. The SMN gene is present in multiple copies in the 
human genome: one SMN1 (telomeric) and several SMN2 (centromeric). SMN2 transcripts are not able 
to translate properly, as during mRNA splicing exon7 is not included, resulting in a presumably 
unstable and not functional protein that is degraded. Consequently, in case SMN1 function is lost, even 
though several SMN2 copies may exist, they cannot fully compensate for the loss of expression of SMN 
protein. Correct splicing may vary by the severity of the disease and may be said to occur in as low as 
only about 10% of SMN2 transcripts (Lunn 2008 Lancet; 371:2120-33).   
The disease has been traditionally classified according to the clinical severity and age of onset as: Type 
I (severe, Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) Type II (intermediate), Type III (mild, Kugelberg-Welander 
disease) and Type IV (adult).  
The proposed therapeutic indication “ZOLGENSMA is indicated for the treatment of: 
-  patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and a 
clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, or  
-  patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 
gene” 
falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan condition “spinal muscular atrophy”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The intention to treat the condition was accepted based on the positive benefit/risk assessment of the 
CHMP (see EPAR of Zolgensma). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has previously acknowledged that the condition is life-threatening and chronically 
debilitating due to muscle wasting, weakness, failure to thrive, pulmonary and orthopaedic 
complications. This view is retained. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
There are three methods used by the sponsor to give estimates of the number of affected patients: a) 
review of the current literature mainly focusing on a review paper by Verhaart et al, based on which 
the sponsor suggests a prevalence range of between less than 0.1 and 0.9 per 10,000; b) an 
estimation from birth incidence data suggesting a prevalence of approximately 0.2 per 10,000 and c) 
an estimation of prevalence from carrier frequency studies of 0.2 to 0.44 per 10,000. 
In particular, the sponsor cites a review paper by Verhaart and colleagues (Prevalence, incidence and 
carrier frequency of 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy - a literature review. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

2017a Jul 4;12(1):124). The applicant used country-specific data from this application and corrected 
for all subtypes by also taking into consideration the proportions reported in Ogino et al., (Eur J Hum 
Genet 2004;12:1015–1023). Overall the sponsor provides an estimate between <0.1 and 0.7 per 
10,000 (Table 1 below). 
Table 1.  Adopted from the sponsor’s March 2020 maintenance report.  
The sponsor has also derived an estimate from birth incidence, by referring data reported by Verhaart 
et al (Verhaart et al., J Neurol. 2017 Jul;264(7):1465-1473.) in conjunction with i) Eurostat birth rates 
for 2016 ii) proportions of subtypes as per Ogino et al., (Eur J Hum Genet 2004;12:1015–1023) and 
iii) median survival for each subtype reported by Farar et al (J Pediatr 2013;162(1):155-159). This 
method yields an estimate of 0.24 per 10,000.  
A third estimate based on carrier frequencies reported in the recent literature (from mainly non-
European studies) and the original orphan drug application (using European data from 2013), is also 
provided by the sponsor, giving a theoretical prevalence between 0.2 and 0.44 in 10,000. 
The COMP has previously considered less than 0.4 per 10,000 and this can be retained for this 
application, in line with the main review paper cited by the sponsor. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition.

Existing methods 
Spinraza, which is a 2´-O-(2-methoxyethyl) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) consisting of 18 
nucleotides has received a centralised MA in the EU and is indicated for “the treatment of 5q Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy”.   
Patients are also managed by supportive care, including provision of nutrition and respiratory 
assistance as needed and treating or preventing complications of weakness. 
Significant benefit 
Protocol Assistance was obtained including a question on significant benefit. It was discussed at the 
time that a) that significant benefit could be based on indirect comparisons between the Spinraza 
study CS3B (also called ENDEAR) and the CL-101 study of the sponsor and b), any claim of major 
contribution to patient care should be supported by clinical data supporting improved convenience by 
reduction of the burden of treatment for patients and caregivers. 
At this stage of maintenance (updated report of the sponsor submitted March 13, 2020), an indirect 
comparison versus nusinersen is presented in line with the above recommendations. With regards to 
efficacy, comparisons of both symptomatic type 1 patients, as well as pre-symptomatic patients are 
presented. 
As regards the symptomatic type 1 patients, improved efficacy is argued on the basis of data from 
study CL-101, juxtaposed to Spinraza studies ENDEAR (CS3B) as well as CS3A. CS3B was the pivotal 
phase 3 DB study for nusinersen enrolling SMA Type 1 patients, while CS3A was an open label study in 
type 1 patients. 
Study CS3B (ENDEAR) enrolled symptomatic infants (symptom onset before 6 months of age, and ≤7 
months of age at screening), diagnosed with SMA-1 (2 copies of the SMN2 gene).  In comparison, 
patient population in study AVXS-101-CL-101 was 6 months of age and younger at the day of vector 
infusion with Type 1 SMA as defined by: (a) Bi-allelic SMN1 gene mutations with 2 copies of SMN2; (b) 
Patients 6 months and younger with disease onset up to 6 months of age; (c). Hypotonia by clinical 
evaluation with delay in motor skills, poor head control, round shoulder posture, and hypermobility of 
joints (The first 9 patients were enrolled under previous versions of the protocol, which allowed an age 
range of 9 months or younger). 
Survival in ENDEAR was defined as time to either (a) death or (b) permanent ventilation, defined as 
≥16 hours ventilation/day continuously for >21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or 
tracheostomy. For CS3A, event-free survival was determined by the proportion of patients who were 
alive and did not require permanent ventilatory support (defined as tracheostomy or the need for 
≥16 hours ventilation/Day continuously for at least 2 weeks in the absence of an acute reversible 
illness). 
In the AVXS-101-CL-101 study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the time from birth to either 
(a) requirement of tracheostomy or ≥16-hour respiratory assistance per day (includes bi-level positive 
airway pressure [BiPAP]) continuously for ≥2 weeks in the absence of an acute reversible illness, 
excluding perioperative ventilation or (b) death. 
It should be noted that the main efficacy survival endpoint for the nusinersen ENDEAR study was 
slightly less restrictive than the criteria used in the AveXis AVXS-101-CL-101 study (permanent 
ventilation, defined as ≥16 hours ventilation/day continuously for >21 days compared with the 
conventional 14 day criteria used in the AveXis study). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

The sponsor discusses that all 12 patients (100%) in AVXS-101-CL-101 Cohort 2 (the therapeutic 
dose) were event-free over a 24-month follow-up period, compared with 61% of nusinersen-treated 
patients and 32% of control patients in ENDEAR over a ~13-month observation period.  In the 
nusinersen CS3A study, 3 patients died during the study period.  Event-free survival at Day 910 was 
69% in CS3A Cohort 2 (64% when the 2 children with 3 copies of SMN2 are excluded), with all events 
occurring by study Day 546.  In the 12 mg nusinersen cohort, 2 participants had a tracheostomy at 6.3 
months and 17.4 months  
In the AVXS-101-CL-101 study all patients (15/15) were alive and without the need for permanent 
ventilatory support at the final study visit 24 months post-dose (one patient in Cohort 1 required 
permanent ventilation at approximately 28 months [22 months post-dose] for hypersalivation; 
however, the child’s ventilatory requirement lessened to below the 16 hours/day threshold after 
surgical ligation of the salivary glands, thus meeting the survival endpoint). All 12 patients in the 
therapeutic dose arm remained alive and without the need for permanent ventilation throughout 
the 24-month follow-up period of the study.  No patients failed therapy and no other additional SMA 
targeted therapies (such as nusinersen) were given. 
Figure 1.  Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time to Death or Permanent Ventilation: 
Nusinersen vs. AVXS-101  
Further to the comparison of the main endpoint, the sponsor also notes: 
• 
Improvements in motor function, as assessed by CHOP-INTEND total score. The score increased 
shortly after AVXS-101 administration and was sustained over time for all 12 patients in 
AVXS-101-CL-101 Cohort 2 and that the level of motor function improvement achieved by AVXS-
101-treated patients substantially exceeded that achieved by nusinersen-treated patients in either 
ENDEAR or Study CS3A.  
•  Ventilation improvements: It is reported that 7 of 12 AVXS-101-treated patients (58%) did not 
require any chronic ventilatory support (and thus required <10% of time on ventilator support) 
assessed when all patients had reached at least 13.6 months of age.  Among the 5 patients that 
did, all were single instances of intubation while the patient was hospitalised, with the duration of 
use ranging from 1 to 9 days.  By comparison, only 33% of nusinersen-treated patients in ENDEAR 
required <10% of time on ventilator support, and 31% required ventilatory support for >50% of 
the time.  
• 
It is also argued that all of the comparable developmental milestones showed an advantage for 
AVXS-101 over nusinersen.  For example, 92% of AVXS-101-treated patients achieved 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000003028   
Page 8/12 
 
 
 
 
independent sitting versus 10% of nusinersen-treated patients in the final analysis of the ENDEAR 
study and 36% at the interim analysis in Study CS3A.  Two of 12 (17%) AVXS-101-treated 
patients were able to walk independently at the time of the primary efficacy endpoint of 13.6 
months, whereas no nusinersen-treated patients achieved this milestone after similar treatment 
periods. 
•  An improvement in the number of hospitalisations is also discussed. Patients treated with the 
therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 required an average of 2.1 hospitalisations per patient year (up to 
24 months follow-up), whereas nusinersen-treated patients in ENDEAR required an average of 4.5 
hospitalisations per patient year (up to 13 months follow-up).  The mean proportion of time 
hospitalized for nusinersen-treated patients was 11.4% (range, 0-50.0%); 59% were hospitalized 
<10% of the time, and 18% were hospitalized ≥20% of the time. For AVXS-101-treated patients, 
the mean proportion of time hospitalized was 4.4% (range, 0-18.3%); 83% were hospitalized 
<10% of the time; none were hospitalized ≥20% of the time (Arjunji et al., 2019). Sixteen percent 
of AVXS-101-treated patients required no hospitalisations, whereas only 2% of nusinersen-treated 
patients required no hospitalisations 
A second indirect comparison with the effects on presymptomatic patients is also performed between 
the ongoing studies CL-304 of the sponsor and nusinersen’s study CS5 (NURTURE).  AVXS-101-CL-304 
is a global Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single IV infusion of AVXS-101 in pre-
symptomatic SMA patients with genetically diagnosed Types 1 and 2 who are aged ≤6 weeks.  
The study is ongoing and was fully enrolled as of 08 November 2019 with a total of 30 patients 
enrolled.  This is juxtaposed to nusinersen study CS5 (NURTURE) which is an ongoing, Phase 2, open-
label, single-arm, multinational study of intrathecal nusinersen in infants who initiate treatment early. 
NURTURE consists of a 5-year treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up evaluation. Participants 
received nusinersen 12 mg administered as intrathecal injections by lumbar puncture, with four loading 
doses (administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and 64), followed by a maintenance dose every 119 days over 
five years. 
The NURTURE study has been ongoing for over 24 months and at the time of the recently 
published interim results from March 2019, all infants were ≥25 months old (De Vivo et al., J 
Neuromuscul Disord. 2019; 29(11):842-856).  The AVXS-101-CL-304 study has been ongoing for 
about 18 months and the patients are younger than those reported in the NURTURE study. The 
sponsor notes a “comparable” efficacy across the efficacy parameters presented, that are common to 
both trials in pre-symptomatic SMA infants (survival, attainment of developmental milestones, motor 
function). 
Such a “comparable” efficacy is not helpful to establish significant benefit. For example with regards to 
survival, at an interim analysis of the CS5 (NURTURE) study when patients had been on study for a 
median of 27.1 months and were of a median age at last visit of 26.0 months, all 25 patients (2 SMN2 
gene copies, n=15; 3 SMN2 gene copies, n=10) were alive without permanent ventilation. The primary 
endpoint of time to death or respiratory intervention could not be estimated at the interim analysis as 
there were too few events.  
Another group of arguments is based on a major contribution to patient care. It is postulated that only 
a single dose of AVXS-101 is highly likely to reduce the burden of treatment for patients and 
caregivers when compared with nusinersen and is not limited by the potential for interruption of 
therapy. AVXS-101 shows improvement in outcomes expected to impact patient care (including 
swallowing function, nutritional support, frequency and duration of hospitalisations, pulmonary events 
and ventilatory support and bulbar function).  However, there is little or no data available in the 
literature for nusinersen for these other outcomes, that would allow for a comparison.

• 
In CL-101, parent(s)/legal guardian(s) reported the number of hours per day the patient required 
ventilation support over the two weeks prior to the visit if support was being used (Al-Zaidy et al., 
Pediatr Pulmonol 2019;54(2):179-185). At baseline (mean age 3.4 months, range [0.9-7.9]), 10 of 
12 (83%) patients in Cohort 2 did not require noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and no patient 
required a tracheostomy at any time throughout the 2-year study period. As of their final study 
visit, 7 of the 10 patients who did not require ventilator support before dosing completed the study 
without any ventilator support. All three patients who did not require NIV at baseline but required 
it postdosing had an early onset of symptoms in the first month of life and a rapid disease 
progression characterized by diffuse muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and inability to 
swallow. The NIV was required in the context of viral illnesses and was maintained thereafter. All 
five infants who required NIV at the final study visit remained stable post-dosing (Al-Zaidy et al. 
Pediatr Pulmonol 2019;54(2):179-185). 
•  CL-101 included videofluoroscopic swallow test assessment to determine swallowing integrity and 
the need for supplemental enteral feeding.  This test was performed at baseline and at the end of 
study (Al-Zaidy et al., Pediatr Pulmonol 2019;54(2):179-185).  At baseline, 7 of 12 (58%) patients 
were able to feed orally and did not require supplemental nutritional support, defined as enteral 
feeding.  Of these 7 patients who entered the study requiring no nutritional support, 6 (86%) 
continued to receive no nutritional support and exclusively fed by mouth (the seventh patient 
continues to feed orally). Video-fluoroscopic swallow studies showed that the number of patients 
who achieved safe swallow function using thin liquids increased from 4 (33%) patients pre-
treatment to 10 (83%) patients at the end of the follow-up period. The number of patients able to 
safely swallow to allow for at least partial oral feeding increased from 7 (58%) patients at baseline 
to 11 (92%) patients at the end of the follow-up period.  Of the 5 patients who entered study 
AVXS-101-CL-101 receiving non-oral feeding support, 4 developed or maintained the ability to feed 
by mouth.  
•  Speech following AVXS-101 treatment was also analysed and 11 of 12 (92%) patients were able to 
speak by the end of the study (Al-Zaidy et al. Pediatr Pulmonol 2019;54(2):179-185). 
As discussed above, while there are no comparisons to be made on the patient care presented data, 
the sponsor has included an indirect comparison of the pivotal trial of nusinersen versus CL-101 data, 
that supports an improvement in the time to death or permanent ventilation. This may be considered 
as a clinically relevant advantage. However, it also has to be noted that during the evaluation the CL-
101 study was considered to be a supportive study due to the manufacturing process of the used 
product. 
It  is  of  note  that  some  of  the  above  data  stem  from  a  different  process  of  manufacturing  than  the 
commercial (process B) product. This is the reason why CL-101 was considered during the assessment 
procedure  to  be  a  supportive  study,  and  study  CL-303  a  pivotal  study.  The  latter  is  a  recently 
completed  (last  patient  last  visit  12  Nov  2019)  Phase  3,  open-label,  single-arm,  single-dose  study  in 
patients with SMA Type 1 with 1 or 2 copies of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene conducted in 
the United States. 
With regards to the CL-303-study results: 
•  Co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved functional independent 
sitting for ≥ 30 seconds at the 18 months of age study visit and survival at 14 months of age. Of 
the 22 enrolled patients, it was reported that 20 (90.9%) were alive without permanent ventilation 
at 14 months of age. The applicant also reported that 14 patients (63.6%) achieved the co-primary 
endpoint, sitting without support for at least 30 seconds. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000003028   
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
•  Co-secondary efficacy endpoints include the proportion of patients maintaining the ability to thrive, 
and the proportion of patients who are independent of ventilatory support. Nine patients (40.9%) 
met all criteria for ability to thrive at 18 months of age. Seventeen of 22 patients (77.3%) were 
independent of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP data) at 18 months of age. It is 
also reported by the sponsor that 21 patients (95.5%) achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40, 14 
patients (63.6%) had achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 50, and 5 patients (22.7%) had achieved a 
CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 60.  
Despite  the  fact  that  the  sponsor  does  not  use  the  CL-303  study  to  perform  comparisons  versus 
nusinersen, the improvement in survival with regards to the CL-101 comparisons, as presented above, 
can be considered as a clinically relevant advantage of improved efficacy.

5.  COMP position adopted on 1 April 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of spinal muscular atrophy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.4 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to muscle wasting, weakness, 
failure to thrive, pulmonary and orthopaedic complications; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Zolgensma may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by 
the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has presented an indirect comparison versus 
nusinersen, supporting an improvement in survival or time to permanent ventilation in treated 
patients with type I disease. The Committee considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Zolgensma, adeno-associated 
viral vector serotype 9 containing the human SMN gene, onasemnogene abeparvovec, EU/3/15/1509 
for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

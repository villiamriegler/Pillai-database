2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin Sandoz is a generic medicinal product of Lyrica, which has been authorised in the EU since 
6 July 2004.  
The  active  substance  of  Pregabalin  Sandoz  is  pregabalin,  an  analogue  of  the  neurotransmitter 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pregabalin decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an 
auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of a voltage-gated calcium channel on neurons in the central nervous 
system.  Pregabalin  reduces  the  release  of  several  neurotransmitters,  including  glutamate, 
noradrenaline, and substance P. 
Pregabalin Sandoz 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102862/2015 
Page 6/23 
 
  
The safety and efficacy profile of pregabalin has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Lyrica. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application  referring  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Lyrica,  summary  of  the  clinical  data  of 
pregabalin is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Pregabalin Sandoz hard capsules have the same qualitative and quantitative composition, in terms of 
active substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Lyrica. Bioequivalence 
of the 50 mg dose with the reference 50 mg Lyrica capsule and 300mg dose with the reference 300mg 
Lyrica capsule was demonstrated clinically. For the remaining doses, CHMP has accepted a biowaiver. 
The indication proposed for Pregabalin Sandoz is the same as authorized for the Reference medicinal 
product. The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 
200 mg, 225 mg or 300 mg of pregabalin as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Capsule content: pregelatinised starch, maize starch and talc. 
Capsule shell: gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide red (E172), and 
iron oxide black (E172) 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC/Alu blisters and HDPE bottle with PP screw cap. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  pregabalin  is  (3S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic  acid  and  it  has  the 
following structure: 
The structure has been confirmed by the following methods: elemental analysis, thermogravimetric 
analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy and 
optical rotation. 
The active substance is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder and is highly soluble 
in hydrophilic media. 
Pregabalin Sandoz 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102862/2015 
Page 7/23 
 
  
 
 
Pregabalin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 1 chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled  routinely  by  chiral  HPLC.    Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  pregabalin.  The  active 
substance  suppliers  produce  polymorphic  form  I  (anhydrous  crystalline  form)  which  is 
thermodynamically stable with respect to conversion to other polymorphs. This form is also present in 
the reference medicinal product. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is sourced from two manufacturers and its production is supported by two active 
substance master files (ASMFs). 
Pregabalin is synthesized in three (for one of the manufacturers) and four (for the other) main steps 
using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacture of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
parts of the ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR), loss on drying (Ph 
Eur), sulphated ash (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur),  related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric purity 
(HPLC), assay (potentiometric titration), and residual solvents (GC).  The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines.    
Analysis data on commercial scale batches of the active substance from both manufacturers (six from 
one, three from the other) were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch and indicate that active substance from both sources is of suitable quality. 
Stability 
Stability data on ten commercial scale batches of active substance from one manufacturer and four on 
commercial scale from the other, stored in container closure systems representative of those intended 
for the market for up to 60 and 24 months respectively under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
was provided. Additional data on six commercial scale batches from one manufacturer and four on 
commercial scale from the other stored for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) was also provided. The protocols and conditions are in line with the ICH guidelines. The following 
parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identification  (IR),  water  content  (KF),  related  substances 
(HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and polymorphic form (PXRD). Results were within 
acceptance criteria for all parameters tested for both manufacturers and no trends were observed. 
One  production  batch  of  pregabalin  from  each  manufacturer  was  tested  under  different  stressed 
conditions: in solution in the presence of acid, base, oxidant or reductant; in the solid state at high 
temperature and high humidity, high temperature and low humidity, and exposed to daylight and UV

light following ICH guideline Q1B, in order to study its degradation. Results show that pregablin is not 
very stable under acidic, alkaline and oxidative conditions but stable under the other tested conditions 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest periods in the proposed containers. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  objective  was  to  develop  a  hard  gelatine  capsule  containing  pregabalin  bioequivalent  to  the 
reference medicinal product Lyrica. 
The  solubility  and  permeability  of  the  active  substance  was  studied  during  development. 
Polymorphism  and  particle  size  are  not  critical  parameters  for  the  dissolution  rate.  Both  active 
substance suppliers produce one polymorphic form (form I). 
All excipients of the capsule filling (talc, starch pregelatinised and maize starch) are commonly used 
in the pharmaceutical industry and are described in Ph Eur.  The hard gelatin capsules contain gelatin 
(Ph Eur) and colorants, titanium dioxide (Ph Eur) and ferric oxides (USP/NF and 231/2012/EC). All 
excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph  Eur 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Two bioequivalence studies were performed investigating Pregabalin 300 mg and 50 mg hard gelatin 
capsules  versus  the  innovator  products  Lyrica  300  mg  and  50  mg  hard  gelatin  capsules.  In  both 
studies, the test products meet the bioequivalence criteria in terms of rate and extent of absorption 
after administration of single dose when compared to the reference products. 
Difference  in  content  of  active  substances  in  both  products  is  within  5  %.  Due  to  the  dissolution 
properties (> 85 % within 15 minutes) and the proportionality of 25 mg and 50 mg on the one side 
and 75 mg to 300 mg on the other side, a biowaiver is acceptable for the strengths 25 mg and for 75 
mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg. 
The only qualitative differences in composition of the test product used in bioequivalence studies and 
the proposed commercial formulation are in the colouring agent in capsule shell and the imprinting of 
capsule. Comparative dissolution profile results of the clinical batches have been provided for both 
strengths (300 mg and 50 mg) of generic and reference products used in bioequivalence studies in 
three  dissolution  media  (0.1N  HCl;  pH  4.5  phosphate  buffer  and  pH  6.8  phosphate  buffers).  The 
dissolution profiles are similar in all three pHs for 50 mg strength. More than 85% of the product is 
released within 15 minutes, therefore the calculation of f2 is not necessary for 50 mg strength. The f2 
factors were calculated for BE batches of 300 mg strength for reference and test product. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  for  hard  gelatine  capsules  with  well-known 
excipients. It consists of mixing steps and encapsulation. The validation results of the manufacturing 
process as well as final batch release and stability data prove that the manufacturing process gives 
products of consistently good quality. 
Pregabalin capsules are packed in PVC/PVDC//Al blisters or HPDE bottles. The packaging materials 
were selected taking into account stability considerations and marketing aspects. The materials are in 
accordance with the Ph Eur and Directive 2002/72/EC. The suitability of the container closure systems 
have been demonstrated by means of stability studies. 
Pregabalin Sandoz 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102862/2015 
Page 9/23 
 
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: production of a pre-mix blend, production of 
a  final  mix  (mother  blend),  filling  of  capsules  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a 
standard manufacturing process. 
Based  on  the  validation  data,  there  are  no  particular  critical  steps  in  the  standard  capsules 
manufacturing process. Four process validation reports were provided. According to these reports, 
in-process parameters, quality parameters and process parameters were controlled, all three process 
validation batches fulfilled the requirements of the relevant control methods, and all three process 
validation  batches  of  mother  blend  and  six  batches  of  capsules  fulfilled  the  requirements  of  the 
relevant control methods. Therefore, the process is reproducible and capable of consistently yielding 
product of the required quality. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and 
comprise  of  tests  for  appearance,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph  Eur),  dissolution  (Ph  Eur), 
identification  (HPLC,  IR),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  water  content  (Ph  Eur),  and 
microbial purity (Ph Eur). 
The proposed limits for water content are quite high, so the CHMP recommends revising them once 
additional  commercial  manufacturing  experience  has  been  gained  and  additional  stability  data 
generated. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  finished  product  to  the  intended 
specification. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot batches of all strengths batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines was provided. The batches were identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), 
dissolution, identification (HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC) and microbiological 
purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Additionally, a photostability study was performed on one batch according to the conditions given in 
ICH guideline Q1B. Samples were illuminated without packaging material for 22 hours with 250 W/m2 
and  samples  packed  in  PVC/PVDC-Al  blisters  were  also  tested  as  a  control.  The  temperature  was 
controlled and did not exceed 30 °C. 
A reduced stability testing design (bracketing) was used for the 100mg, 150mg, 200mg and 225mg 
strengths  according  to  ICH  guideline  Note  for  guidance  on  bracketing  and  matrixing  designs  for 
stability testing of drug substances and drug products (CPMP/ICH/4104/00). 
All results comply with the proposed specifications and no significant change in product quality was 
observed.

Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of 
the gelatine used in the manufacture was provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The proposed limits for water content are quite high, so the CHMP recommends revising them once 
additional  commercial  manufacturing  experience  has  been  gained  and  additional  stability  data 
generated. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  was  provided.  The  overview  justifies  why  there  is  no  need  to 
generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the 
introduction of Pregabalin Sandoz manufactured by Sandoz GmbH is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all pregabalin containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is expected to be 
Pregabalin Sandoz 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102862/2015 
Page 11/23 
 
  
similar and not increased. The CHMP endorsed this view.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
NA 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview presented by the applicant is largely based on published scientific literature 
which is acceptable since pregabalin is a well-known active substance.  
There are no objections to the approval of Pregabalin Sandoz from a non-clinical point of view. The 
SmPC  of  Pregabalin  Sandoz  is  in  line  with  that  of  the  reference  product  Lyrica  and  is  therefore 
acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing pregabalin. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting 
conditions; 2011-17-HGC-4 (with the highest strength, 300 mg), and Study 2011-16-HGC-2 (with 50 
mg). These studies were pivotal for the assessment. 
The biowaivers for 25 mg (from the 50 mg strength), and for 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 
225 mg strengths (from the 300 mg strength) are acceptable. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of pregabalin based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment the 
Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1/Corr**)  is  of 
particular relevance.   
GCP 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
According 
to 
the  Guideline  on 
the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(Doc.  Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear 
and that the bioequivalence is demonstrated for one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the 
other  strengths  could  be  waived.  An  exemption  from  the  requirement  to  perform  bioequivalence 
studies would be justified when the following conditions are met: the pharmaceutical products have 
the  same  manufacturer,  same  qualitative  composition,  same  ratio  between  active  substance  and 
excipients and in vitro dissolution profile comparable to the reference product.

The composition of the strengths 25 and 50 mg of the test product is quantitatively proportional. 
Further, the composition of the strengths 75, 100, 150, 200, 225 and 300 mg of the test product is 
quantitatively proportional. Therefore, two single-dose bioequivalence studies have been conducted 
with the highest strength of both composition groups, i.e. with 50 and 300 mg hard gelatine capsules. 
A biowaiver has been applied for the 25 mg (from the 50 mg strength), and for 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 
mg, 200 mg and 225 mg strengths (from the 300 mg strength). The applicant provided a tabular 
listing of the composition of the respective strengths and their dissolution curves at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 
6.8. More than 85% of the drug was dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values tested.  
Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria were met. Therefore, 
two bioequivalence studies with the 50 mg and the 300mg doses and a biowaiver for the additional 
strengths were considered adequate. 
Clinical studies 
To  support  the  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  2  bioequivalence  studies;  Study 
2011-17-HGC-4  (with  the  highest  strength,  300  mg),  and  Study  2011-16-HGC-2  (with  50  mg). 
Neither pharmacodynamic nor therapeutic equivalence studies were submitted.

Test and reference products  
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 
Pregabalin Sandoz 50 mg manufactured by Hexal AG (batch No. AS6609-A/1, manufacturing date 
Feb 2010; retest date Jan 2012) has been compared to Lyrica 50mg manufactured by Pfizer Limited 
(Batch No: 0463120D/1, exp. date Nov 2013.  
Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
Pregabalin Sandoz 300 mg manufactured by Hexal AG (batch No. AS3167-A/1, manufacturing date 
Feb 2010; retest date Jan 2012) has been compared to Lyrica 50mg manufactured by Pfizer Limited 
(Batch No: 04671 20D11, exp. date Nov 2013.  
For  both  50mg  and  300mg  formulations,  the  differences  between  the  formulation  of  the  tested 
product and the formulation intended for marketing were minor. The CHMP was of the opinion that 
these differences have no clinical impact.   
Population studied   
Study 2011-16-HGC-2  
Assuming an intra-subject co-efficient of variation of approximately 20% for Cmax, the number of 
subjects required would be 52 subjects (with an expected ratio of 0.91 to 1.10, power: 95% and 
α=5%). To account for possible dropouts, 56 subjects were enrolled in this study in order to complete 
with a minimum of 52 subjects.  
56  male,  healthy,  non-smoker  subjects  were  enrolled.  One  subject  (No.48)  discontinued  due  to 
serious adverse event (convulsion) in the first period of the study, and his data were not included in 
the  PK  evaluation.  In  total,  data  from  55  subjects  were  used  for  the  pharmacokinetic/PK  and 
statistical analysis/evaluation. 
Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
Assuming an intra-subject co-efficient of variation of approximately 15% for Cmax, the number of 
subjects required would be 30 subjects (with an expected ratio of 0.91 to 1.10, power: 95% and α
=5%). To account for possible dropouts, 34 subjects were enrolled in this study in order to complete 
with a minimum of 30 subjects. 
34  male,  healthy,  non-smoker  subjects  were  enrolled.  There  were  no  drop-outs  or  withdrawn 
subjects. Data from all subjects were used in the PK and statistical evaluation.

Analytical methods   
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 and Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
Plasma  pregabalin  concentrations  were  measured  using  a  validated  solid  phase  extraction  with 
UPLC-ESI-MS/MS bioanalytical method on Waters Acquity and Quattro Premier XE mass spectrometer 
using deuterium labelled pregabalin (pregabalin D4) as internal standard. K3-EDTA was used as an 
anticoagulant. A calibration curve was extending from 0.0300 to 15.00 μg/mL with a LLOQ of 0.0300 
μg/mL. Additional precision and accuracy was conducted for calibration curve parameters in range of 
0.03 µg/ml to 3.00 µg/ml and for back calculated concentration for calibration curve standards in 
range of 0.03 µg/ml to 2.40 µg/ml. 
In-study validation  
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 
Plasma concentrations of pregabalin were determined by the above mentioned validated method. In 
total 4416 samples were collected and 2208 samples were run in 31 batches including 3 batches of 
incurred samples for reanalysis. Calibration range was validated to be between 0.03 and 3.0 µg/ml. 
QC  concentration  samples  were  0.09  µg/ml  (LQC),  1.20  µg/ml  (MQC)  and  2.40  µg/ml  (HQC). 
Inter-run precision was ≤3.09% and the mean accuracy ranged from 98.67 to 100.0%. LLOQ was 
below 1/20 of average Cmax (i.e.1.744 µg/ml). Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed on 
222  samples.  Results  of  ISR  were  within  the  acceptance  criteria  i.e.  at  least  2/3rd  of  reanalysed 
samples had difference within ±20% compared to initial analysis (only two samples for subject No. 26 
have not passed). 
Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
2270  samples  were  collected  and  1360  samples  were  run  in  20  batches  including  2  batches  for 
incurred samples for reanalysis and 1 batch for repeat analysis. Reanalysis was performed due to 1 
sample (out of acceptance criteria for accuracy) in calibration standard concentration STD 7 (0.150 
µg/ml)  in  run  No.  3.  Calibration  range  was  validated  to  be  between  0.03  and  15.0  µg/ml.  QC 
concentration samples were 0.09 µg/ml (LQC), 6.0 µg/ml (MQC) and 12.0 µg/ml (HQC). Inter-run 
precision was ≤3.0% and the mean accuracy ranged from 98.33 to 99.0%. LLOQ was below 1/20 of 
average  Cmax  (i.e.  8.478  µg/ml).  ISR  was  performed  on  136  samples,  of  which  none  of  them 
deviated more than 20% from the original value. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 and Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  evaluated  using  a  standard  non-compartmental  model.  The 
primary and secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (AUCo-t, AUCo-inf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel and T1/2) 
were evaluated by using WinNonlin® Enterprise Software (Version 5.3). 
Statistical methods   
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 and Study 2011-17-HGC-4  
The statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters was carried out using procedure PROC 
GLM of SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). Analysis of variance was carried out using SAS® 
Version  9.2  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  USA)  for  ln-transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-inf  and 
untransformed Tmax, Kel and t½. ANOVA model included sequence, subject nested into sequence, 
period and formulation effects.

Criteria  for  conclusion  of  bioequivalence  were  based  on  the  statistical  results  of  90%  confidence 
intervals (80.00-125.00%) for the geometric least square mean ratio (A/B) of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-t.  
The sequence effect has been tested at the 0.10 level of significance using the subjects nested within 
sequence mean square from the ANOVA as the error term. All other effects such as formulation and 
period were tested at 0.05 level of significance. 
Two one-sided 90% confidence intervals for geometric least square means ratio obtained from the 
analysis of ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf of Test (A) and Reference (B) formulations 
were constructed using root mean square error computed by PROC GLM. 
Intra-subject variability and power were calculated for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf using root mean square error computed by PROC GLM. 
No interim analysis was performed in either of the studies

Safety data 
Study 2011-16-HGC-2 
One serious adverse event was observed during the course of the study. Subject No. 48 reported the 
SAE (convulsion) during period 1 of the study after the administration of the test product. The SAE 
was not life threatening, but severe in intensity and had a suspected relationship to the study drug. No 
other adverse events were observed.  
Study 2011-17-HGC-4 
Pregabalin test and reference formulation were generally well tolerated. Three subjects (subject No. 
06, 07 and 25) reported adverse events during the conduct of the study (two cases of vomiting and 
one case of clinically significant increase in triglycerides levels) after treatment with the reference 
medication. In one case of vomiting (subject No. 25), causal relation with the reference product was 
suspected. There were no deaths, SAEs or significant AEs during the course of the study.

Conclusions 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  2011-16-HGC-2  Pregabalin  Sandoz  50  mg  is 
considered bioequivalent with Lyrica 50 mg. The results can be extrapolated to other strength 25 mg, 
according 
to 
conditions 
in 
the  Guideline  on 
the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  2011-17-HGC-4  Pregabalin  Sandoz  300  mg  is 
considered bioequivalent with Lyrica 300 mg. The results can be extrapolated to other strengths 75 
mg,  100  mg,  150  mg,  200mg  and  225  mg,  according  to  conditions  in  the  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, two bioequivalence studies have been conducted with the highest strength 
of both composition groups, i.e. with 50 and 300 mg hard gelatine capsules.  
Taking into account that the pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range are linear and the 
requirements for in vitro dissolution testing, as set in Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
for  biowaiver  of  additional  strengths,  have  been  met,  the  applied  bracketing  approach  for 
bioequivalence testing with two strengths is adequate.  
The  BE  studies  were  performed  as  per  protocol  and  all  other  pertinent  requirements  of  the  ICMR 
guidelines,  ICH  (Step  5)  Guidance  on  Good  Clinical  Practice,    Declaration  of  Helsinki  (1996),  EMA 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence and in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice.  
The  methodological  aspects  of  the  design  of  the  studies  2011-16-HGC-2  and  2011-17-HGC-4  are 
appropriate, i.e.  open label, single-dose, randomized, 2-way crossover study design, where subjects 
are randomized into one of two sequences, each consisting of four periods is fully in line with the 
European requirements. 
Both studies were conducted under standardised conditions. The sampling time points as well as the 
wash-out  period  of  7  days  were  adequate.  Pregabalin  was  measured  in  human  plasma  using  a 
validated  UPLC-ESI-MS/MS  method.  The  analytical  method  for  the  determination  of  pregabalin  in 
human plasma and respective validations were adequate; the validation was performed according to 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
EMA 
“Guideline 
on 
bioanalytical  method 
validation” 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). Acceptance criteria were in a plausible range and were fulfilled.  
The pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test to reference ratio of 
geometric LSmeans and the corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax and AUC0-t were all 
within the standard acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%.  
The  CHMP  has  asked  the  Applicant  to  provide  more  information  concerning  the  GCP  inspection 
reports.  The  additional  details  were  assessed  by  CHMP  to  provide  sufficient  reassurance  of  the 
compliance of dosing in conducted bioequivalence studies.

The safety of the formulations was also assessed on the basis of clinical and laboratory examinations 
at the beginning, during and at the end of the study and by the registration of adverse events. As 
expected, the test and reference products had a comparable safety profile.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  pivotal  bioequivalence  studies  submitted,  Pregabalin  Sandoz  hard 
capsules are considered bioequivalent to Lyrica hard capsules.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Lyrica (for content) and Sandoz generic clozapine, 
memantine and ziprasidone (for style and format). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has 
been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pregabalin hard capsules. The reference product Lyrica 
is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, adjunctive therapy 
in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but 
an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented 
and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on 
the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active 
substance;  the  applicant’s  clinical  overview  on  these  clinical  aspects  based  on  information  from 
published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with an open label, single-dose, randomized, 2-way 
crossover study design. The design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Pregabalin Sandoz met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Lyrica. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 
125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The results of study 2011-17-HGC-4 with 300 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths: 
75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg, and the results of study 2011-16-HGC-2 with 50 mg 
formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  25 mg  strength,  according  to  conditions  in  the  relevant 
Guideline. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
required beyond those included in the product information.  
4.  Recommendation

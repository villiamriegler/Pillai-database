2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The following indication is claimed in this extension of indication procedure: “Jyseleca is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a 
biologic agent.” 
Epidemiology 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, idiopathic inflammatory disease that affects the colon, most 
commonly afflicting adults aged 30 to 40 years and resulting in disability. It is characterized by 
relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation, starting in the rectum and extending to proximal 
segments of the colon. From the turn of the 21st century, UC has become a global disease with 
accelerating incidence in newly industrialized countries. Although the incidence is stabilizing in Western 
countries, burden remains high, as prevalence exceeds 0.3%. These data highlight the need for 
research into the prevention of UC and innovations in health care systems to manage this complex and 
costly disease (Ng 2017).  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial and comprises immune, genetic, environmental, and microbial 
components.  
Clinical presentation 
Dis-coordinated activity of both innate and adaptive immune responses, in combination with epithelial 
barrier defects and dysbiosis, leads to an inflammatory cascade, resulting in clinical signs and 
symptoms of UC (Ungaro 2016). Hallmark symptoms of UC are bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency, and 
tenesmus. The clinical course usually involves periods of remission interspersed with periods of active 
disease. Ulcerative colitis may also be associated with extraintestinal manifestations, including ocular 
lesions, skin lesions, arthritis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, UC carries an increased 
risk of colorectal cancer.  
Management 
The treatment paradigm for UC has historically comprised an initial treatment for acute disease, with 
the goal of inducing a state of clinical remission, followed by a therapeutic intervention to maintain 
remission. Generally, patients presenting with mild to moderate disease activity are initially 
administered an anti-inflammatory agent such as a 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) derivative, with or 
without concurrent corticosteroids. Patients who fail to respond to initial therapy or who present with 
Assessment report

moderate to severe disease activity require treatment with more effective agents such as 
immunomodulators and biologic therapy. For nearly 2 decades, biological therapies were dominated by 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents but have recently included anti-integrin and anti–interleukin 
(IL)-12/IL-23 antibodies (Sands 2019b, Singh 2018). Although biological therapies have led to 
substantial improvements in the care of patients with UC and have become an integral part of standard 
therapy, not all treated patients benefit from these therapies (Colombel 2010, Feagan 2013). 
Depending on the duration of therapy and the clinical endpoints chosen, approximately one-third of 
patients do not respond after initiation of biological therapy (primary nonresponse). Among patients 
who initially respond to treatment with biologics, 30% to 50% eventually stop responding (secondary 
nonresponse), resulting in exposure to potential side effects and toxicities without durable clinical 
benefit. These findings highlight the unmet medical need in these patients. The clinical need for new 
therapies has led to the development of orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitors that target signal 
transduction pathways involved in the pathogenesis of UC, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. 
Janus kinases are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine signaling from 
membrane receptors to signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors. The 4 known 
JAK family members are JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Upon cytokine binding, JAKs autophosphorylate 
or transphosphorylate, creating sites for STAT binding and subsequent phosphorylation, dimerization, 
and translocation to the nucleus where STATs modulate the transcription of effector genes. Currently, 
the only JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment of UC is tofacitinib.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Filgotinib (FIL; GS-6034, formerly GLPG0634) is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive and 
reversible inhibitor of the JAK family. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising 
from cytokine or growth factor receptor interactions on the cellular membrane. JAK1 is important in 
mediating inflammatory cytokine signals, JAK2 in mediating myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis and JAK3 
plays critical roles in immune homeostasis and lymphopoiesis. Within the signalling pathway, JAKs 
phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate 
intracellular activity including gene expression. Filgotinib modulates these signalling pathways by 
preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. In biochemical assays, filgotinib preferentially 
inhibited the activity of JAK1 and showed > 5 fold higher potency of filgotinib for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3 
and TYK2. In human cellular assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited JAK1/JAK3 mediated signalling 
downstream of the heterodimeric cytokine receptors for interleukin (IL) 2, IL 4 and IL 15, JAK1/2 
mediated IL 6, and JAK1/TYK2 mediated type I interferons, with functional selectivity over cytokine 
receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2 or JAK2/TYK2. GS-829845, the primary metabolite of filgotinib, 
was approximately 10 fold less active than filgotinib in in vitro assays, while exhibiting a similar JAK1 
preferential inhibitory activity. In an in vivo rat model, the overall pharmacodynamic effect was 
predominantly driven by the metabolite. 
It is currently indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease modifying 
anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Jyseleca may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX). 
The pivotal Study GS-US-418-3898 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled combined 
Phase2b/3 study in adult subjects with moderately to severely active UC who were biologic naive or 
biologic experienced. Filgotinib and placebo were administered orally for up to 58 weeks. This study 
was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in the induction and maintenance of 
remission of UC.

guidance/scientific advice 
No scientific advice has been sought from the CHMP.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive package of non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology data for 
filgotinib was submitted as part of the original marketing application (MAA) (EMA/CHMP/367247/2020) 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). New pharmacology data has been generated to support 
the extension of the indication to include the treatment of UC.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
The MAH has evaluated the effect of filgotinib and its metabolite, GS-829845, in three intestinal 
inflammation models of human UC in mice: the acute DSS model, the chronic DSS model and the T cell 
transfer model. While these animal models cannot recapitulate all aspects of human UC, DSS models 
and T cell transfer models are commonly suited to screen for substances that affect the innate immune 
system and the adaptive immune system, respectively. The new in vivo studies with filgotinib are 
presented in the table below.

PK analysis 
Filgotinib plasma exposure was above the mouse whole blood EC50 value 
of 3.1 μM (IL-6 stimulated pSTAT1 in CD4+ T cells) for approximately 2 
hours in the 30 mg/kg group, and GS-829845 was below the mouse whole 
blood EC50 value of 19.9 μM for the full dosing period.  The maximum 
inhibition of whole blood IL-6-stimulated phosphor STAT1 in CD4+ T cells 
of 45%±10 was observed in the 30 mg/kg group at 0.5 hours post-last 
dose. 
CHMP conclusion: 
In the acute DSS model in mice, filgotinib dose-dependently improved 
DSS-induced acute colitis-associated disease activity, reduced some 
histological measures of colonic inflammation, and reduced inflammatory 
serum proteins.   
Most effects of filgotinib at 30 mg/kg in this model appeared to be 
comparable to the positive control sulfasalazine. 
Objective: Evaluation of filgotinib activity in the chronic DSS induced 
colitis model

Filgotinib showed a trend to improve Colon Lesion Scores 
PK analysis 
Plasma exposures of filgotinib and GS-829845 did not exceed 
mouse whole blood EC50 values at steady state in this model (IL-
6-stimulated pSTAT1 in CD4+ T cells), calculated as 1600 ng/mL 
and 7100 ng/mL, respectively. 
CHMP conclusion: 
Filgotinib 30 mg/kg significantly reduced DAI score on Days 4, 11, 
14, 15, and 16 in the chronic DSS model. A trend in colon lesion 
score reduction by 43% was observed with filgotinib 30 mg/kg.The 
plasma exposure of filgotinib was estimated to be lower than EC50 
in mouse whole blood assay over the entire dosing interval. 
Tofacitinib and sulfasalazine had no significant effect on the DAI 
score in this study.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetics data were provided. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology data were submitted. In the initial marketing authorisation application, filgotinib 
related adverse effects were observed in male reproductive system including microscopic testicular 
changes and reduced spermatogenesis and fertility. The lesions in testis consisted of germ cell 
depletion/degeneration and/or tubular vacuolation with correlating changes in epididymides (reduced 
sperm content and/or increased cell debris) and was observed in animals including rats and dogs with 
dogs being most sensitive. In dogs, effects were observed already after 4-weeks of administration 
while in rats, effects were seen after 13 weeks. In dogs, adverse testicular effects were observed at 
AUC exposure margins from 0.9-fold of the clinical exposure at 200mg. In fertility studies in rats, 
reduced male fertility (5% fertility) and marked testicular lesions and marked reduced sperm quality 
and quantity occurred at 60 mg/kg/day with a NOAEL at 30 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 
approximately a 3-fold AUC exposure marginal to the clinical daily dose at 200 mg. 
At LOAEL for male reproductive organs generally no changes of hormonal levels or seminology 
parameters was observed except for increased LH levels in rats. At higher doses (and exposure) a 
decrease of testosterone, FSH and inhibin levels was observed in rats. In dogs, no changes of 
testosterone or FSH levels were observed at any dose. 
A recovery group was included in the 13-week study in rats in which partial reversibility of findings in 
testes (minimal to moderate) and epididymides (minimal to severe) was observed after 8 weeks of 
recovery when dosed at 60 mg/kg/day (only high dose animals were included during the recovery 
period). Further, partial reversibility was observed in dogs treated for 13 weeks with the high dose of 
filgotinib (15 mg/kg/day) followed by 8 weeks of recovery showing reduced number of sperms and 
normal sperms without microscopic testicular changes. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) was previously submitted for Jyseleca (filgotinib) as part of 
the EU initial MAA. The initial ERA for filgotinib predicted environmental concentrations were estimated 
based on forecasted sales figures provided by the MAH. These forecasts covered the period of 2020 – 
2028 for filgotinib and included predicted consumptions for future indications to be filed for filgotinib. 
Therefore, the MAH stated that it can be considered that the sales forecasts employed in the previous 
ERA accounted for the potential sales increase due to the proposed addition of the ulcerative colitis 
indication. The CHMP agreed with the MAH that the estimated predicted environmental concentrations 
(PECs) are still conservative and that no further update to the assessment is necessary.  
The ERA for filgotinb is summarised below.

In summary, filgotinib was found to be very persistent in the sediment compartment but is not 
considered as a PBT or vPvB substance. One transformation product U1 is identical with the major 
metabolite GS-845829. Based on a complete Phase II assessment it can be concluded that filgotinib is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A series of in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in order to characterize the efficacy of 
filgotinib and the major metabolite GS-829845 in animal models of intestinal inflammation. 
In innate and adaptive immune cell-driven UC models of intestinal inflammation, filgotinib dosed alone 
or in combination with its metabolite GS-829845, showed improvements of body weight, fecal

consistency and bleeding with a reduction in colonic histological measures of inflammation, a reduction 
in colonic pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels, a reduction in colonic inflammatory gene expression and tissue 
cytokines, immune cell subset homeostatic restoration, and a reduction in serum inflammatory 
proteins.   
Consistent with a longer duration of filgotinib exposure, the improvements in disease activity and 
pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced in the T cell transfer model compared to the DSS 
models. 
Overall, the results from the provided in vivo pharmacodynamic studies provide supportive scientific 
rationale for filgotinib as a treatment in patients with UC. 
The toxicological program provided at the initial MAA, revealed that filgotinib induced adverse effects 
on male reproductive system and fertility. Despite further investigations, intended to shed light on 
potential mechanisms for the toxicity, no further understanding has been gained. Thus, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. However, it seems clear that the toxicity is caused by 
filgotinib, and not by GS-829845, the major metabolite of filgotinib (see Clinical Safety section).  
Furthermore, a mistake from the initial marketing authorisation in 5.3 of the SmPC was corrected and 
it is now stated that spermatogenic and histopathological effects were not fully reversible at exposure 
margins of approximately 7- to 9-fold the exposure at the 200 mg once daily dose in humans. This 
information is based on studies GLPG0634-TX-012 and GLPG0634-TX-024 according to which 
histopathological effects in the testes were no longer present in 15 mg/kg/day animals, while in rats 
complete recovery was demonstrated after 5 weeks recovery at 30 mg/kg in the fertility study 
(GLPG0634-TX-024). 
The new indication is not likely to lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of filgotinib. Filgotinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment, since the calculated 
risk quotients were all below 1.  
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive package of non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology data for 
filgotinib has been assessed as part of the initial MAA (EMA/CHMP/367247/2020) for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
New pharmacology data has been generated to support the extension of the indication to include the 
treatment of UC. Those results provide supportive scientific rationale for filgotinib as a treatment in 
patients with UC. 
The new indication is not likely to lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of filgotinib. Filgotinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment, since the calculated 
risk quotients were all below 1.  
Overall, the CHMP considered that the non-clinical package to support the new indication in UC was 
acceptable.

Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical method for the determination of filgotinib and GS-829845 (primary metabolite of 
filgotinib) in human plasma with dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) as 
anticoagulant was developed and validated at QPS, LLC (Newark, DE, United States). The method 
involved protein precipitation of filgotinib and GS-829845 and their deuterated internal standards (GS 
833369 and GS-833368, respectively) from human plasma, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). Bioanalytical method validation parameters are summarized in the 
table below.

To provide model predicted individual subject PK parameter estimates from PopPK models for 
exposure-response (ER) analysis 
PopPK analyses of filgotinib and GS-829845 evaluated data from a Phase 2b/3 clinical study in subjects 
with UC (GS-US-418-3898). The table below provides further details regarding study drug regimens 
and the number of subjects with intensive or sparse PK sampling. Subjects were evaluable for PopPK 
analysis if they had at least 1 adequately documented filgotinib administration and a corresponding 
measurable plasma concentration after administration of the dose. 
Table 5 
GS-US-418-3898 - study drug regimens and the number of subjects with 
intensive or sparse PK sampling 
Filgotinib is extensively metabolized primarily via carboxylesterase 2, and GS-829845 is the major 
circulating active metabolite, accounting for 92% of the circulating total radioactivity in plasma. Clinical 
and non-clinical data indicate that renal elimination is the primary clearance pathway for GS-829845. 
The PK was similar between subjects with UC and subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for both 
filgotinib and GS-829845, based on comparison of intensive PK from Phase 3 studies. Thus, the current 
models for filgotinib and GS-829845 in subjects with UC were based on previously developed models 
to characterize PK in subjects with RA and healthy subjects. External model validation was first applied 
to assess model adequacy. Parameter re-estimation based on the same structural models would be 
further performed if improvement in model fitting was needed to better describe the PK profiles in 
subjects with UC.   
The PopPK analysis was performed using the computer program NONMEM (ICON; Gaithersburg, MD) 
Version 7.4 or later, Perl-speaks-NONMEM Version 4.8.1 or later, and R Version 3.6.3 or later. 
Filgotinib Model 
The Original Dataset contained 2759 filgotinib concentration-time data points from 1020 subjects. The 
Model Evaluation Dataset included all PK data except the BLQ samples (6%, 159 PK samples). In the 
Model Development Dataset, 239 samples (9%) of the filgotinib plasma concentrations were further 
censored based on pre-specified criteria (pre-dose samples and late PK samples etc). The remaining 
data in the Model Development Dataset had a total of 2361 data points from 1001 subjects. A 
summary of the filgotinib PopPK Analysis datasets is presented in the table below.

The final filgotinib model was based on a previously developed model for subjects with RA and healthy 
subjects. The external validation indicated that the RA model systematically underpredicted Cmax and 
overpredicted Ctau of filgotinib in subjects with UC (Figure 1). As such, the model parameters were re-
estimated and RA-related covariates adjusted.

The final filgotinib population PK model based on data from UC subjects compriced of a 2-compartment

clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume of distribution of the drug (Vc/F), ka, and duration of the 
zero-order input (D1). Previously identified significant covariates were retained in the model, including 
formulation on relative bioavailability (F); baseline body weight (WT) on CL/F, apparent 
intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), Vc/F, and apparent peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F); sex 
female (SEXF) on CL/F; and race (white and Asian versus black or African American versus other) on 
Vc/F. Baseline C-reactive protein (bCRP) on CL/F, which was included in the previous model, was

considered irrelevant to UC and was removed based on lack of statistical significance in covariate 
re-evaluation. Also, formulation effect was fixed due to the use of only 1 formulation in 
Study GS-US-418-3898, which is the same as that in the RA Phase 3 studies and is the commercial 
formulation. No additional covariates were evaluated for this population. The final model parameters 
and the shrinkage estimates of the inter-individual variability (IIV) are presented in the tables below.

Parameter estimates in this UC model were similar to those in the previous model for subjects with RA 
and healthy subjects. The post hoc individual exposures of filgotinib in subjects with UC were 
comparable with those in the subjects with RA, with a percent geometric mean ratio (%GMR) of 
109.1%, 97.4%, and 142.2% for AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau, respectively.

Datasets in Study GS-US-418-3898 
An external model validation using the previously developed model for RA and healthy subjects was 
used to predict the GS-829845 PK in subjects with UC. The previous model was a 1-compartment 
model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. An IIV was included on CL/F, Vc/F, and ka. 
Baseline creatinine clearance (bCLcr), bCRP, subject status, and SEXF were identified as statistically 
significant covariates on CL/F, whereas RA duration, WT, and Asian race were identified as statistically 
significant covariates on Vc/F. In addition, formulation was found as a significant covariate on F. In 
subjects with UC, coefficient for RA duration was fixed to 0 and the formulation effect was fixed due to 
the use of only 1 formulation in Study GS-US-418-3898. No additional covariates were evaluated for 
this population for the GS-829845 model. The previously developed model adequately captured the 
observed GS-829845 plasma concentrations in subjects with UC, and parameter re-estimation was not 
necessary.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
According to the MAH, cytokine signalling is a major component of innate and adaptive immune 
responses and aberrant cytokine receptor activation is associated with many chronic inflammatory 
conditions, including UC (Salas 2020).  Inhibition of cytokine signalling via the disruption of the JAK-
STAT pathway can target multiple processes involved in intestinal inflammation, cellular activation, 
proliferation of immune cells associated with UC, and disruption of immune homeostasis (cf Figure 
below).  Filgotinib is being developed to inhibit intracellular signalling pathways associated with 
cytokine receptor activation.

Page 25/178 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4 
Pleiotropic Role of JAK-Associated Receptors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease  
In vivo pharmacology has demonstrated that inhibition of JAK1 results in marked inhibition of 
pathways that drive intestinal STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and in the reduction of disease 
activity in animal models of UC. In the mouse acute dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of UC, 
pharmacological inhibition of JAK1 with filgotinib demonstrated significant dose-dependent efficacy in 
improving body weight, fecal consistency, intestinal bleeding, and histological measures of colonic 
inflammation, as well as reducing serum inflammatory protein markers tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In the mouse chronic DSS model of UC, 
filgotinib was effective in improving body weight, fecal consistency and occult positivity (bleeding), in 
reducing colonic pSTAT3 levels and neutrophil and macrophage infiltrates, and in reducing serum 
inflammatory protein markers and chemoattractant factors. In the T cell adoptive transfer model of 
UC, co-administration of filgotinib with GS-829845 was used to model the pharmacodynamic pSTAT1/3 
inhibition observed in human clinical studies.  Co-administration of filgotinib and GS-829845 once daily 
resulted in improvements in body weight, fecal consistency, bleeding, colonic histology inflammation 
measures, and a reduction in colonic pSTAT1+ and pSTAT3+ cells. Additional homeostatic alterations 
in immune cellular subsets in blood, colon and spleen, and improvements in colonic inflammatory gene 
expression and cytokine levels were observed.  According to the MAH, these in vivo studies 
demonstrate that filgotinib can markedly reduce intestinal inflammation in mouse models of UC. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In both innate and adaptive immune cell-driven UC models of intestinal inflammation, filgotinib dosed 
alone or in combination with GS-829845, resulted in improvements of body weight, fecal consistency 
and bleeding with a reduction in colonic histological measures of inflammation, a reduction in colonic 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 26/178 
 
 
 
 
pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels, a reduction in colonic inflammatory gene expression and tissue cytokines, 
immune cell subset homeostatic restoration, and a reduction in serum inflammatory proteins.   
In both acute and chronic DSS models JAK target inhibition in the 30 mg/kg group was calculated to be 
at or below EC50 throughout the dosing period.  In the adaptive T cell transfer model where filgotinib 
was co-dosed with GS-829845, target inhibition was above EC50 for approximately one quarter of the 
dosing interval. Target inhibition in the T cell transfer model most closely mirrors the predicted human 
pharmacodynamic pSTAT1/3 inhibition in UC patients. Consistent with a longer duration of inhibition, 
the improvements in disease activity and pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced in the T cell 
transfer model. For example, both pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 were reduced in colons, nearly all histological 
measures of inflammation were significantly reduced, and extensive inhibition of inflammatory gene 
expression and tissue cytokines were observed.     
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response (ER) analyses were performed following completion of the Phase 2 study in 
subjects with Crohn’s disease (CD) (GLPG0634-CL-211) to support dose selection for the Phase 2b/3 
study, as well as on completion of the Phase 2b/3 study (GS US 418-3898), to confirm the dose 
proposed for commercialization. As both filgotinib and its metabolite, GS-829845, contribute to efficacy 
via JAK1 inhibition, their exposures were combined by accounting for relative inhibition potency in the 
analyses for efficacy, see equation below.  
AUCeff = AUCtau-FIL + AUCtau-met * 1/10 * (425.51/357.43) 
Where AUCtau-FIL and AUCtau-met are the steady-state AUCtau of filgotinib and GS-829845, respectively. 
The corresponding equation was used to calculate effective concentration (Ceff). Predicted exposures in 
terms of AUCeff and Ceff were based on PopPK modelling. 
The ER analyses for safety were performed separately for filgotinib and GS-829845 to characterize the 
individual safety profile of each analyte based on Phase 2b/3 data in subjects with UC. 
Exposure-Response for Efficacy 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint of EBS remission at week 
10 for the induction studies and at week 58 for the Maintenance Study. Additional secondary efficacy 
endpoints were also included in the exposure-efficacy analyses. The efficacy endpoints evaluated are 
summarized as follows: 
• 
Induction studies: EBS remission at Week 10 (primary), MCS remission, an endoscopic 
subscore of 0, Geboes histologic remission, and MCS remission (alternative definition) 
•  Maintenance Study: EBS remission at Week 58 (primary), MCS remission, an endoscopic 
subscore of 0, Geboes histologic remission, MCS remission (alternative definition), sustained 
EBS remission, and 6-month corticosteroid-free EBS remission 
The PK/PD Analysis Set for PK-efficacy included subjects with UC who received filgotinib and had 
evaluable PopPK-based exposure estimates (AUCeff and Ceff) for both filgotinib and GS-829845 (N = 
1001 for the induction studies and N = 362 for the Maintenance Study). 
Induction Studies 
In the induction studies, exposure-efficacy relationships were evaluated by comparing AUCeff in 
subjects who achieved and who did not achieve EBS remission at Week 10 by dose (Figure 5). The 
AUCeff overlapped between subjects who achieved (black) and subjects who did not achieve (gray) EBS

remission within each dose, for Cohort A (biologic-naive subjects), Cohort B (biologic-experienced 
subjects), or combined Cohorts A and B, indicating a lack of ER relationship within each dose. 
Figure 5 Induction Studies: AUCeff in Subjects with UC by EBS Remission Status and 
Filgotinib Dose at Week 10 (PK/PD Analysis Set, Study GS-US-418-3898) 
Additional graphical analyses based on MCS remission, an endoscopic subscore of 0, Geboes histologic 
remission, and MCS remission (alternative definition) against AUCeff and EBS remission against Ceff, did 
not show an exposure-efficacy relationship within each dose. 
Maintenance Study 
In the Maintenance Study, AUCeff also overlapped between those who achieved (black) and those who 
did not achieve (gray) EBS remission within each dose, indicating a lack of ER relationship within each 
dose (Figure 6).  
Exposure-efficacy graphical analyses combining data from the 2 doses of filgotinib showed a positive 
relationship between the proportions of subjects who achieved EBS remission and the AUCeff quartile 
groups in the Maintenance Study (Figure 7).

by AUCeff Quartile Group (PK/PD Analysis Set and Placebo Subjects, Study GS US 418 3898) 
Additional graphical analyses based on MCS remission, an endoscopic subscore of 0, Geboes histologic 
remission, MCS remission (alternative definition), 6-month corticosteroid-free EBS remission, and 
sustained EBS remission against AUCeff and EBS remission against Ceff did not show an exposure-
efficacy relationship within each dose. 
Exposure-Response for Safety 
The ER analyses for safety were based on the pooled population across biologic-naive and biologic-
experienced subjects and were performed separately for filgotinib and GS-829845 to characterize the 
individual safety profiles of each analyte. The filgotinib exposures (AUCtau) were compared in pooled 
subjects across the filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg groups between who experienced and who did not 
experience the selected safety events. 
The 5 most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in the filgotinib 200 
mg once daily group in the induction studies combined and in the Maintenance Study (GS-US-418-
3898 Final) were selected for evaluation in the ER analyses for safety. Similarly, the 5 most frequent 
Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities that occurred in the filgotinib 200 mg once daily group in the 
induction studies combined and in the Maintenance Study (GS-US-418-3898 Final) were also 
evaluated. In the event that 2 or more safety endpoints of interest shared the same occurrence, they 
were all included in the analyses. Accordingly, 6 TEAEs in total were evaluated for both the induction

studies combined and for the Maintenance Study, while 6 and 5 Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities 
were evaluated for the induction studies combined and the Maintenance Study, respectively.  
Safety endpoints evaluated are summarized as follows: 
• 
TEAEs in the induction studies: headache (5.9%), nasopharyngitis (5.3%), colitis ulcerative 
(5.3%), anemia (3.7%), nausea (3.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (3.0%).  
•  Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the induction studies: phosphate decrease (3.6%), 
lymphocyte decrease (2.2%), hemoglobin decrease (2.0%), creatine kinase increase (1.4%), 
neutrophil decrease (0.6%), and white blood cell (WBC) decrease (0.6%). 
• 
TEAEs in the Maintenance Study: nasopharyngitis (10.9%), colitis ulcerative (10.4%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.4%), arthralgia (4.0%), abdominal pain (4.0%), and back pain 
(4.0%).  
•  Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the Maintenance Study: creatine kinase increase 
(4.0%), phosphate decrease (2.5%), lymphocyte decrease (2.5%), hemoglobin decrease 
(1.5%), and serum potassium increase (1.5%).

for neutrophil decrease and N = 3 for WBC decrease) and thus, analyses in these groups may not be 
conclusive.

A similar finding was observed for Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. It is worth mentioning that 
higher data variability was noted, particularly for Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, due to small 
sample size (N < 12) of subjects who experienced selected Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The main investigation of filgotinib’s PK properties was assessed and reported in the initial marketing 
authorisation application (i.e. the RA indication). Population PK analyses of filgotinib and GS-829845 
evaluated data from a Phase 2b/3 clinical study in subjects with UC (GS-US-418-3898). Intensive PK 
samples were collected in 41 subjects and sparse PK samples were collected in 1001/1010 
(parent/metabolite) subjects. The filgotinib population PK model for the RA population was used as the 
basis for the UC population model. The external validation of the RA model indicated that the model 
did not adequately describe UC subject data. Subsequently, the model parameters were re-estimated 
and the bCRP covariate (RA specific) was removed from the model. However, systematic 
underprediction of Cmax is still present in the final model. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimates 
(%RSE) are unreasonably low (<2%) for several model parameters and the condition number (highest 
divided by lowest eigenvalue) for the model is >300 000 indicating that the model has severe stability 
issues. In addition, the covariate ‘other race’ on volume of distribution have a confidence interval that 
includes zero (bootstrap results), suggesting that the covariate is not informative and should be 
removed from the model. The model stability issues as well as the inability to describe the absorption 
phase (and subsequently Cmax) were also present in the RA model and subsequently, in the RA 
submission the population PK results were not considered reliable. The population PK analysis for the 
metabolite GS-289845 is considered adequate. 
In summary, the filgotinib PK model for UC subjects is not considered reliable by the CHMP. However, 
as this issue was already identified during the initial MAA and there is sufficient clinical data to support 
the dose selection, the issues with the filgotinib PK model have not be further pursued by the CHMP. 
An NCA analysis for patients with ulcerative colitis was requested by CHMP in order to consistently 
compare the expected exposure between the patients with different diseases, doses and methods. 
Additionally, the MAH was asked to provide graphical presentation of the observed PK data stratified on 
dose. Furthermore, it was pointed out by CHMP that predefined criteria used for assessing clinical 
relevance are required. An NCA analysis of PK data from 13 UC patients was submitted in the response 
to CHMP questions and the results indicate that filgotinib exposure increased more than dose 
proportionally after administration of 200 mg filgotinib. Furthermore, the results indicate that the 
disproportional increase in exposure is slightly more pronounced in patients with ulcerative colitis 
compared to those with rheumatoid arthritis (2.7-times vs. 2.5-times, respectively). Nonetheless, it 
should be kept in mind that the overall number of patients with ulcerative colitis included in this 
analysis is very small (n=13, 200 mg dose), thus results should be interpreted with caution. Overall, 
the CHMP concluded that these results were acceptable from a PK perspective considering the data 
gathered in the clinical study using the proposed dosing regimen in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
Graphical exposure-response analyses have been performed based on predicted exposure based on the 
population PK analyses. Due to the issues identified with the filgotinib population PK analysis, the 
reliability of the predicted exposure is uncertain and thus, the results from the exposure-response 
analyses should be interpreted with caution.  
Exposure-efficacy relationships has been explored with a combined exposure for filgotinib and the 
active metabolite GS-289845 which is the same approach as was used in the initial MAA. For both 
induction and maintenance treatment, the graphical analyses of exposure-response indicate that there 
is no difference in exposure between responders and non-responders within each dose. For the full 
exposure range (exposures from both maintenance doses combined), a trend of increasing efficacy 
with increasing exposure was visible supporting that an increased dose leads to an increase in efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 37/178 
 
 
 
Graphical exploration of exposure-safety relationships has been performed separately for filgotinib and 
the active metabolite GS-289845 which is acceptable. However, it should be noted that there is a 
concern regarding the reliability of predicted filgotinib exposure and as such the exposure-response 
relationships should be interpreted with caution.  
In summary, although the exposure-response analyses are not considered pivotal for dose selection in 
the UC population, the CHMP concluded that the results support that an increased dose results in 
increased efficacy and no unexpected or concerning exposure-safety trends were apparent. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The filgotinib PK model for UC subjects is not considered reliable by the CHMP. However, as this issue 
was already identified during the initial MAA and there is sufficient clinical data to support the dose 
selection, the issues with the filgotinib PK model have not be further pursued by the CHMP. 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC has been adequately updated with information on PK parameters in UC. 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the new UC indication was acceptable from a PK perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No Phase 2 dose-ranging studies were conducted with filgotinib in subjects with moderately to severely 
active UC. The doses evaluated in the UC program were based on the results of a Phase 2 Study 
GLPG0634-CL-211 (FITZROY) evaluating the safety and efficacy of filgotinib in subjects with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD). An overview and a summary of the results of the 
FITZROY study are included below: 
Study GLPG0634-CL-211 (FITZROY): Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-
centre study to investigate the efficacy and safety of GLPG0634 in subjects with active 
Crohn’s disease with evidence of mucosal ulceration 
Methods 
The study design was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase II study.   
It comprised 2 parts (Figure below). The treatment assignment was blinded for the full 20 weeks study 
duration.

Figure 16 - Study GLPG0634-CL-211 (FITZROY) study diagram 
At baseline, eligible subjects with documented history ileal, colonic or ileo-colonic CD, with of moderate 
to severe active disease (CDAI score during screening ≥ 220 to ≤ 450) and with evidence of active 
inflammation as demonstrated by endoscopic confirmation of active disease were randomized in a 3:1 
ratio to receive either filgotinib 200 mg QD or placebo for 10 weeks. Based on their clinical response in 
Part 1, subjects in Part 2 either continued their current treatment or were reassigned to a different 
treatment (filgotinib 100 mg QD or placebo) for an additional 10 weeks. Clinical response was defined 
as a reduction in CDAI of ≤ -100 points. 
The filgotinib study medication was presented as an oral brown film-coated tablet containing filgotinib 
as HCl-salt equivalent to 100 mg filgotinib. It was administered with a glass of water daily in the 
morning. 
Subjects receiving mesalazine and olsalazine, or oral steroids for UC (≤30 mg prednisolone 
equivalent/day or budesonide dose ≤9 mg/day) were eligible provided they were on a stable dose for 
the required period of time. Previous exposure to immunomodulators (e.g., thiopurines and MTX) was 
permitted, but had to be discontinued at least 25 days prior to the first dose. Subjects previously not 
exposed to anti-TNF treatment (TNF-naïve) and subjects previously exposed to anti-TNF therapy 
(infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab pegol) at a dose registered for the treatment of CD were 
both eligible, but anti-TNFs had to be discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to Baseline. Subjects deemed 
by the treating physician as a primary or secondary non-responder or intolerant to anti-TNF treatment 
or responders to anti-TNF treatment where treatment was stopped for other reasons (TNF-
experienced) could also be included. 
The stratification factors in the randomization process were: 
Part 1:  
- anti-TNF naïve or anti-TNF experienced (responder and non-responder) (50%/50% fixed strata) 
- Screening CRP ≤ 10mg/L / Screening CRP > 10 mg/L 
- oral glucocorticosteroids use at Baseline (yes/no). 
- Part 2: 
- clinical response (yes/no) at Week 10 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 39/178 
 
 
 
 
- anti-TNF naïve or anti-TNF experienced (responder and non-responder) 
- oral glucocorticosteroids use at Baseline (yes/no). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate efficacy in terms of the percentage of subjects achieving 
clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score < 150) following 10 weeks treatment with filgotinib 200 mg 
q.d. versus placebo in subjects with active CD with evidence of mucosal ulceration. 
The secondary objectives were: 
1. To evaluate the efficacy in terms of percentage of subjects achieving clinical response, clinical 
remission, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and mucosal healing with filgotinib given q.d. 
compared to placebo.  
Clinical response was defined as a decrease in CDAI of at least 100 points versus Baseline. 
Endoscopic remission was defined as a SES-CD score ≤ 4, with ulcerated surface subscore no 
greater than 1 in any segment. 
Endoscopic response was defined as a reduction of SES-CD score by at least 50% versus 
Baseline. 
Mucosal healing was defined as a SES-CD score equal to 0. 
2. To assess the effect of filgotinib (compared to placebo) on subject’s quality of life using the 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). 
3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of filgotinib given to subjects with CD. 
4. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of filgotinib and its metabolite (G254445) in subjects with 
CD. 
5. To assess the effects of filgotinib on selected pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers (eg, C-reactive 
protein [CRP], fecal calprotectin, serum analytes/micro ribonucleic acid [miRNA], whole blood gene 
expression/miRNA, fecal microbiota). 
6. To evaluate the effect of GLPG0634 on histopathological features of the intestinal mucosa. 
The following evaluations were performed: 
- Simplified Endoscopy Score for CD (SES-CD) scoring during colonoscopy at baseline and Week 10. 
Only central reading results were used in the efficacy analysis. 
- During each colonoscopy, biopsies covering 6 segments [rectum, sigmoid, left colon, transverse 
colon, right colon, and ileum] were obtained. Histopathology findings were scored using the D’Haens 
scoring system for CD by a central laboratory. The scoring system contained 8 histological variables 
that were scored independently, with grading from 0-3. 
- CDAI scoring at baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 20, and at end of treatment (if applicable). All 
diary data for this assessment were collected over 7 days immediately prior to the study visit. An 
additional local laboratory hematocrit value was used to calculate the CDAI at Week 10 for re-
randomization purposes only. The CDAI score calculation at Screening Visit 2 and Week 10 visit 
excluded diary data from the day prior to the colonoscopy visit (due to the bowel preparation during 
that day). 
- Assessment of quality of life using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at baseline, 
Weeks 10, 20, and end of treatment visit (if applicable). The IBDQ is a 32-item disease-specific 
Assessment report

questionnaire consisting of 4 domains (bowel symptoms, emotional function, social function, and 
systemic symptoms). 
- Pharmacodynamic assessments at every visit: C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum, calprotectin levels 
in stool  
- Blood samples were collected from subjects participating in the PK substudy, to assess the steady-
state PK of filgotinib and its metabolite (G254445). Samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 
hours post morning dose of study medication at either the Week 2 or the Week 4 visit. 
- No exposure-response (E-R) modelling was performed due to the fact that only one filgotinib dose 
was tested versus placebo in Part 1 of the study. 
- Safety evaluations were monitored in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
Statistical Methods for the main analysis (Part 1 of the study)  
The intent-to-treat [ITT] population was defined as all randomized subjects who have at least 1 dose 
of study drug and have at least 1 post baseline assessment of the CDAI score in the period (n=172). 
The Per-protocol [PP] population was a subpopulation of ITT, excluding major protocol deviations 
related to the first study period (n=141). The safety population was defined as all subjects randomized 
and exposed at least once dose (n=174). 
The methods of handling missing data during the first part of the study were as follows: 
- Missing data for subjects who prematurely discontinue the study during the first part were imputed 
for the remainder of the first part but were not imputed for the second part. 
- Binary data in discontinued subjects: subjects were classified as non-responders (non-responder 
imputation (NRI) algorithm) for the remaining visits in the analysis period. 
-Continuous data (e.g., CDAI, SES-CD, IBDQ, CDAI subscores) in discontinued subjects: a last-
observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach was used to impute missing data for the remaining visits 
in the analysis period. 
The sample size calculation was based on the expected clinical remission rates at Week 10. Assuming 2 
treatment arms with unequal 3:1 group allocation (n=135 for the filgotinib 200 mg group and n=45 for 
the placebo group, total n=180 subjects), a 5% 2-sided type I error and a 20% to 30% clinical 
remission rate for placebo, then the study has 80% power to detect a 22% to 24% treatment 
difference versus placebo at Week 10.   
Statistical Methods for Part 2 of the study  
The study was not powered for Part 2. All results (including any provided p-values) are purely 
descriptive. In addition, the number of subjects in the different groups was low. 
Subjects disposition 
A total of 311 subjects were screened and 174 subjects across 52 sites in 9 countries (Belgium, Czech 
Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia and the UK) were randomized and 
treated. 
A schematic overview of the subject disposition in the ITT Population for the entire study (i.e. including 
re-randomization based on response during Weeks 1-10) is provided in the Figure below.

Overall, a total of 148 subjects (85.1%) completed study part 1. A total of 26 subjects (14.9%) 
discontinued the study during the first 10 weeks of treatment. The reasons for discontinuation were 
treatment failure (13 subjects [7.5%]), the occurrence of AEs (7 subjects [4.0%]), subject withdrew 
consent (4 subjects [2.3%]), subject lost to FU and reasons listed as “other” (1 subject [0.6%] each). 
Overall, no relevant difference in the number of subjects who discontinued was observed between the 
GLPG0634 and placebo groups in the first 10 weeks of the study (refer to table below).

A total of 123 subjects out of 147 subjects (83.7%) who completed Part 1 and were treated in Part 2 
completed study part 2. A total of 24 subjects (16.3%) discontinued the study during the second study 
part. The reasons for discontinuation were treatment failure (11 subjects [7.5%]), subject withdrew 
consent (7 subjects [4.8%]), and the occurrence of AEs (6 subjects [4.1%]) (refer to table below).

At Baseline of part 1, the mean (SE) CRP was 15.61 (1.551) mg/L, the mean (SE) fecal calprotectin 
was 606.9 (72.95) mg/kg, the mean (SE) CDAI clinical score was 293.1 (4.13), and the mean (SE) 
Baseline endoscopic SES-CD score was 14.6 (0.53). The overall mean (SE) duration of CD was 8.31 
(0.598) years.  
At Baseline, 88 subjects (50.6%) used oral GCSs; 101 subjects (58.0%) were anti-TNF experienced 
non responders, 69 subjects (39.7%) were anti-TNF naïve, and 4 subjects (2.3%) were anti-TNF 
experienced responders. 
Efficacy results in part 1 of the study  
CDAI Clinical Remission at Week 10 (Primary Efficacy Endpoint) 
The primary endpoint of the study was met. At Week 10, 60 of 128 subjects (46.9%) who received 
filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission versus 10 of 44 subjects (22.7%) who received placebo (p 
= 0.0077). (Refer to Table below). 
Sensitivity analysis (NRI-LOCF-OC [ITT Population [Part 1]] and NRI-LOCF [PP Population [Part 1]] 
confirmed the above results proving a negligible influence of both missing data (early discontinuations) 
and major protocol deviations.

Main efficacy secondary endpoints  
● CDAI clinical remission at Week 10 by stratification factors   
A statistically significant influence of anti-TNF experience on CDAI clinical remission was shown. After 
10 weeks of treatment, CDAI remission was achieved by 59.6% of subjects on filgotinib 200 mg q.d. 
compared with 12.5% of subjects on placebo in the subgroup of anti-TNF naïve subjects; CDAI 
remission was achieved by 36.6% and 28.6% of subjects, respectively, in the subgroup of anti-TNF 
experienced subjects. 
No statistically significant influence of Baseline use of oral glucocortisosteroids or Screening CRP was 
shown. 
● CDAI 100-points clinical response 
The percentage of subjects achieving CDAI 100-points clinical response in the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. 
group increased over time and was numerically higher in the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. group compared 
with the placebo group at all time points. The difference was statistically significant at Week 10 
(76/128 (59.4%) versus 18/44 (40.9%), p = 0.0453). 
● Total SES-CD score 
The total SES-CD score (centrally read) showed a small mean decrease in the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. 
treatment group (-2.6 at Week 10) and the placebo group (-2.7 at Week 10); the difference was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.8051). 
● Endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, mucosal healing 
- The percentage of subjects with SES-CD endoscopic remission at Week 10 was numerically higher in 
the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. group compared with the placebo group (17/128 (13.3%) versus 3/44 
(6.8%), p = 0.3682); however, the difference was not statistically significant. 
- The percentage of subjects with SES-CD endoscopic response at Week 10 was numerically higher in 
the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. group compared with the placebo group (32/128 (25.0%) versus 8/44 
(18.2%), p = 0.4390); however, the difference was not statistically significant. 
- The percentage of subjects with SES-CD mucosal healing at Week 10 was low and similar in the 
filgotinib 200 mg q.d. group and the placebo group (2/128 (2.3%) versus 1/44 (2.3%), p = 0.7785). 
● Total D’Haens score 
The histopathology total D’Haens score showed a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in 
the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. treatment group (-3.5 at Week 10) compared with the placebo group (-0.6 
at Week 10) (p = 0.0359). 
● Total IBDQ score  
The total IBDQ score improved during the 10 weeks of treatment in both the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. and 
placebo groups at Week 10 (+33.82 and +17.56 respectively); the increase was statistically 
significantly higher in the filgotinib 200 mg q.d. treatment group compared with placebo at Week 10 (p 
= 0.0046).

The proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical remission slightly decreased through the end of the study 
in initial responders (filgotinib 200 mg q.d. or placebo) (refer to table below). 
In initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. non-responders continuing on filgotinib 200 mg q.d. and initial placebo 
non-responders switching to filgotinib 100 mg q.d., the proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical 
remission increased after Week 10. However, also in initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. non-responders 
switching to placebo, an increased number of subjects achieved clinical remission at Week 20 (refer to

● Clinical response at Weeks 12, 16, and 20. 
The proportion of subjects with CDAI 100-points clinical response slightly decreased through the end of 
the study in initial responders (filgotinib 200 mg q.d. or placebo) (refer to table below). 
In initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. non-responders continuing on filgotinib 200 mg q.d. and initial placebo 
non-responders switching to filgotinib 100 mg q.d., the proportion of subjects with CDAI 100-points 
clinical response remained stable or increased after Week 10. However, also in the group of initial non-
responders switching to placebo, some subjects achieved these clinical response criteria at Week 20 
(refer to table below).

- In the initial responders’ population, the total CDAI score remained stable or increased slightly after 
Week 10, but it remained lower than Baseline at Week 20. The mean change in CDAI score between 
Week 10 and Week 20 was equal to: 
- Initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. responders→placebo: - 2.0 (± 13.83) 
- Initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. responders→ filgotinib 100 mg q.d: + 32.5 (± 17.28) 
- Initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. responders→ filgotinib 200 mg q.d: + 31.6 (± 15.94) 
- In the initial non-responders’ population, the mean change in CDAI score between Week 10 and 
Week 20 was equal to: 
- Initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. non-responders→ placebo: - 43.0 (± 29.02) 
- Initial filgotinib 200 mg q.d. non-responders→ filgotinib 200 mg q.d: + 16.5 (± 18.40) 
- Initial placebo non-responders→ filgotinib 100 mg q.d: -18.8 (± 28.01)

Justification for the selection of doses for phase 2b/3 studies in UC as provided by the MAH: 
In the Phase 2 study GLPG0634-CL-211 (FITZROY), the primary endpoint was met, establishing the 
efficacy of filgotinib 200 mg: at Week 10, 46.9% (6/128) subjects who received filgotinib 200 mg 
achieved clinical remission versus 22.7% (10/ 44) subjects who received placebo (p = 0.0077).   
In Part 2, 31.8% (7/22) subjects, who did not achieve clinical remission at Week 10 on placebo in Part 
1 and were subsequently reassigned to filgotinib 100 mg in Part 2, achieved clinical remission at Week 
20. Although exploratory, the efficacy results for filgotinib 100 mg in Part 2 suggest a treatment effect 
of filgotinib 100 mg. 
Based on the similarities in the targeted inflammatory pathways between CD and UC, existing 
treatment regimens for UC and CD are generally similar between the 2 conditions (e.g., infliximab, 
adalimumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab). In the absence of data from dose ranging Phase 2 
studies of filgotinib in subjects with UC, the efficacy observed in subjects with CD in the exploratory 
10- to 20-week arm of study GLPG0634-CL-211 supported the evaluation of the 100-mg and 200-mg 
once-daily dose regimens of filgotinib in study GS-US-418-3898, with an interim futility analysis for 
each induction study. The interim futility analysis for Study GS-US-418-3898 was performed after 
approximately 175 subjects completed Week 10 or discontinued from each induction study, and 
efficacy as assessed by endoscopic response (i.e. the proportion of subjects who achieved an 
endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 for each treatment group) and overall safety were reviewed by a Data 
Monitoring Committee. The Cohort A Induction Study and the Cohort B Induction Study passed the 
predefined futility criteria and both filgotinib dose groups were evaluated for efficacy and safety in 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC in the induction studies and the maintenance Study.

Figure 18 Design of the pivotal Study GS-US-418-3898 
Study GS-US-418-3898 comprised the Cohort A Induction Study (biologic-naive subjects), the Cohort 
B Induction Study (biologic-experienced subjects), and the Maintenance Study.  
In the induction studies, subjects were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive filgotinib 200 mg, 
filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo. Male subjects in the United States (US) and Korea who were not dual 
refractory (having failed any TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive either filgotinib 100 mg or placebo. 
Subjects in the induction studies were permitted to receive stable doses of the following: oral 5-ASA 
compounds, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX]), and 
oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone prescribed at a stable dose of ≤ 30 mg/day or budesonide 
prescribed at a stable dose of ≤ 9 mg/day). 
Subjects who completed the induction studies (Day 1 to Week11) and achieved either 
endoscopy/bleeding/stool frequency (EBS) remission or Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) response at Week 10 
were rerandomized into the Maintenance Study (Week 11 to Week 58), as follows: subjects who 
received filgotinib 200mg in the induction studies were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on 
filgotinib 200mg or switch to placebo; subjects who received filgotinib 100 mg in the induction studies 
were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on filgotinib 100 mg or switch to placebo; and 
subjects who received placebo in the induction studies continued on placebo.  
Starting at Week 14, subjects who were on concomitant steroids began tapering steroid therapy.  
Subjects who completed the Week 58 visit in the Maintenance Study had the option to continue study 
drug in a blinded fashion in an LTE study (GS-US-418-3899; study ongoing).  
Subjects who did not achieve EBS remission or MCS response at Week 10 of induction treatment, or 
who met disease-worsening criteria in the Maintenance Study, were discontinued from blinded 
treatment in Study GS-US-418-3898 and had the option to receive open-label filgotinib 200 mg in 
StudyGS-US-418-3899, with the exception of males in the US and Korea who were not dual refractory

(having failed any TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab); these subjects received open-label filgotinib 
100 mg in Study GS-US-418-3899. After Study GS-US-418-3898 was unblinded, Study GS-US-418-
3899 was also unblinded, at which point subjects who were receiving blinded placebo treatment were 
discontinued and subjects who were receiving blinded filgotinib treatment continued on the same dose 
(as received when blinded) of open-label filgotinib treatment. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects must have met all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in either the 
Cohort A Induction Study or the Cohort B Induction Study. 
1) Had the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which was obtained prior to 
initiation of study procedures. 
2) Were males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive, based on the 
date of the screening visit. 
3) Females of childbearing potential (as defined in the clinical study protocol) must have had a 
negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline. 
4) Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who engaged in heterosexual 
intercourse must have agreed to use protocol-specified method(s) of contraception as described in the 
clinical study protocol.  
5) Had a documented diagnosis of UC of at least 6 months AND with a minimum disease extent of 15 
cm from the anal verge. Documentation should have included endoscopic and histopathologic evidence 
of UC as follows: 
a) The criteria for documentation of UC based on endoscopy was medical record 
documentation of, or an ileo-colonoscopy (full colonoscopy with the intubation of the terminal 
ileum) report dated ≥ 6 months before enrolment, which showed features consistent with UC, 
determined by the procedure performing physician. 
b) The criteria for documentation of UC based on histopathology was medical record 
documentation of or a histopathology report indicating features consistent with UC as 
determined by the pathologist. 
6) A surveillance colonoscopy was required prior to screening in subjects with a history of UC for ≥ 8 
years, if one was not performed in the prior 24 months. 
7) Had moderately to severely active UC as determined by a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a 
rectal bleeding (RB)score ≥ 1, a stool frequency (SF) score ≥ 1 , and Physician’s Global Assessment 
score of ≥ 2 as determined by the Mayo Clinic scoring system, with endoscopy occurring during 
screening; total score must have been between 6 and 12, inclusive. 
8) Have met one of the following TB screening criteria:  
a) No evidence of active or latent TB: i)  A negative Quanti-FERONTB-Gold In-Tube test (or 
centrally reported equivalent assay) at screening, AND ii) A chest radiograph (views as per 
local guidelines) taken at screening or within the 3 months prior to screening (with the report 
or films available for investigator review) without evidence of active or latent TB infection, AND 
iii) No history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 49/178 
 
 
 
b) Previously treated for TB: i.e., if a subject had previously received an adequate course of 
therapy per local standard of care for either latent TB (e.g., 9 months of isoniazid in a location 
where rates of primary multi-drug resistant TB infections were <5% or an acceptable 
alternative regimen) or active TB (acceptable multi-drug regimen). In these cases, no Quanti-
FERON TB-Gold In-Tube test (or centrally reported equivalent assay) needed to be obtained, 
but a chest radiograph was obtained if not already obtained within 3 months prior to screening 
(with the report or films available for investigator review). It was the responsibility of the 
investigator to verify the adequacy of previous anti-TB treatment and provide appropriate 
documentation. 
c) Newly identified latent TB during screening: i.e., a subject who had a newly identified 
positive diagnostic TB test result (defined as a positive Quanti-FERON®TB-Gold In-Tube test 
[or centrally reported equivalent assay]) in which active TB had been ruled out and for which 
appropriate, ongoing, prophylactic treatment for latent TB had been initiated for a minimum of 
4weeks prior to the first administration of study medication. Adequate treatment for latent TB 
was defined according to local country guidelines for immunocompromised subjects. Quanti-
FERON® testing was not repeated except in the case of a single repeat for indeterminate 
results. Cases that fell under category “b” and “c” needed to be approved by the sponsor prior 
to enrolment in the study. No subject with currently active TB was enrolled in the study, 
regardless of past or present anti-TB medication use.

Mayo Clinic Scores (MCS): 
The MCS system is a composite index of 4 disease activity variables. Each variable is scored 
individually on an integer scale of 0 to 3, inclusive, with higher scores indicating greater disease 
activity. The individual components of the MCS include stool frequency (SF), rectal bleeding (RB), 
endoscopic subscore, and the physician’s global assessment (PGA). SF and RB are determined using an 
electronic daily diary, which collects subject reported components directly. The primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, except for histologic based endpoints, are all based on the four individual 
components. MCS is calculated as the sum of the 4 subscores, ranging from 0 to 12. A pMCS is 
calculated as the sum of the 3 subscores excluding the endoscopic subscore, ranging from 0 to 9.

SF 36  
The SF-36 is a HRQoL instrument consisting of 36 questions belonging to 8 domains in 2 components 
and covers a 4-week recall period: 
• 
Physical well-being, 4 domains: physical functioning (10 items), role physical (4 items), bodily 
pain (2 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). 
•  Mental well-being, 4 domains: vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role emotional (3 
items), and mental health (5 items). The remaining item (health transition) is not part of the 
above domains but is kept separately. These scales were rescaled from 0 to 100 (converting 
the lowest possible score to 0 and the highest possible score to 100), with higher scores 
indicating a better quality of life. The SF-36 is not disease specific and has been validated in 
numerous health states.

The number of subjects planned were approximately 650 subjects for each cohort, for a total of 1300 
subjects. A sample size of 130 subjects in the placebo group and 260 subjects in each filgotinib dose 
(200 mg or 100 mg) group was expected to provide 90% power for each filgotinib dose group 
comparison to placebo at a 2-sided 0.025 significance level to detect a treatment difference in EBS 
remission rate at Week 10 of 15% (25% on filgotinib and 10% on placebo). 
Maintenance Study 
Assuming an induction response rate (i.e., proportion of subjects achieving either EBS remission or 
MCS response at Week 10) of 55% among subjects receiving filgotinib 200 mg or 100 mg treatment, 
approximately 285 subjects from each filgotinib dose group from Cohorts A and B Induction Studies 
combined would be eligible to be re-randomised into the Maintenance Study. A sample size of 95 
subjects in the placebo group and 190 subjects in the filgotinib group at the same dose level as the 
induction dose (200 mg or 100 mg) was expected to provide more than 85% power for each filgotinib 
dose group comparison to placebo at a 2-sided 0.025 significance level to detect a treatment difference 
in maintenance EBS remission rate at Week 58 of 20% (40% on filgotinib and 20% on placebo).

Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups via an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS) using stratified randomisation schedules. 
Induction studies (cohorts A and B) 
Subjects who were found eligible were enrolled in Cohort A or Cohort B based on prior exposure to 
biologic therapy and were subsequently randomised 2:2:1 to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 
mg or placebo. Male subjects from the US and Korea who had not failed at least 2 biologic therapies 
(any TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab; non-dual refractory) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either 
filgotinib 100 mg or respective placebo. 
Within each cohort, treatment assignments were stratified according to the following factors: 
Cohort A, Biologic-Naïve Induction Study 
•  Concomitant use of oral, systemically absorbed corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) at Day 1, 
(Yes/No) 
•  Concomitant use of immunomodulators (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], azathioprine, 
methotrexate [MTX]) at Day 1, (Yes/No) 
Cohort B, Biologic-Experienced Induction Study 
• 
Exposure to one biologic agent versus more than one biologic agent 
•  Concomitant use of oral, systemically absorbed corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) at Day 1, 
(Yes/No) 
•  Concomitant use of immunomodulators (e.g., 6-MP, azathioprine, MTX) at Day 1, (Yes/No) 
Maintenance study 
Re-randomisation for Maintenance Study at Week 11 
Subjects in Cohorts A and B who completed the Induction Study and achieved either EBS remission or 
MCS response at Week 10 were re-randomised into the Maintenance Study at Week 11. Subjects 
receiving filgotinib 200 mg or 100 mg in the induction studies were randomised in a 2:1 manner to 
either continue on the assigned filgotinib regimen or to placebo for the duration of the Maintenance 
Study.

Statistical methods 
Induction Studies (Cohorts A and B) and Maintenance study 
Analysis sets 
The primary analysis set for efficacy analyses was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). In cohorts A and B, FAS 
included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the corresponding 
induction study (Day 1 to Week 10). In the maintenance study, FAS included all re-randomised 
subjects who met the protocol definition of EBS remission or MCS response at Week 10 and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in the Maintenance Study (Weeks 11 to 58). 
A Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set was defined for each induction study and the maintenance study and 
included a subset of subjects in the respective FAS as based on pre-defined criteria. 
For analyses based on FAS, subjects were grouped according to the treatment to which they were 
randomised. For analyses based on e.g. the PP Analysis Sets and the Safety Analysis Sets, subjects 
were grouped according to actual treatment received. 
Primary analysis 
The primary analysis compared each filgotinib dose group to placebo on the proportion of subjects 
achieving EBS remission at Week 10 for Cohorts A and B and at week 58 for the Maintenance study, 
respectively. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach adjusting for stratification factors was 
used for hypothesis testing of the primary endpoint. The stratified CMH chi-square p-value was 
provided for each of the comparisons. Strata with low numbers of subjects may have been aggregated 
for the CMH test. The 2-sided 95% CI of EBS remission rate based on normal approximation method 
with a continuity correction was provided for each treatment group. In addition, non-stratified risk 
difference estimated along with its 2-sided 95% CI using the normal approximation (i.e., the Wald 
method) with a continuity correction for the difference in proportions was provided. Stratification 
variables based on the eCRF data were used for the analysis. Subjects who did not have sufficient 
measurements to determine efficacy endpoints were considered failures (i.e., non-responder 
imputation [NRI]). 
Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
All the sensitivity analyses used the same statistical method that was used for the primary analysis. 
Per-Protocol Analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 60/178 
 
 
 
Analyses were performed based on the corresponding PP Analysis Sets for the Cohort A Induction 
Study, Cohort B Induction Study, and the Maintenance Study. 
Locally Read Endoscopic Sub Score Analyses 
To evaluate the potential disparity between centrally read endoscopy scores versus locally read scores, 
EBS remission rates using investigator read endoscopic sub scores were analysed based on the FAS. 
Missing Data Imputation Analyses 
To evaluate the impact from missing data on the EBS remission rates at Week 10 and Week 58, the 
following missing value imputations were used: 
Observed Cases Only 
Observed cases were used for analysis without any imputation. Only subjects in the FAS with both 
baseline and Week 10 (or Week 58) data were included for analysis. 
Missing = Success 
Subjects in the FAS, who did not have sufficient data to decide on EBS remission status, were imputed 
as having achieved EBS remission. 
Missing = Success for the Placebo and Missing = Failure for the Filgotinib Groups 
Subjects in the FAS, who did not have sufficient data to decide on EBS remission status, were imputed 
as having achieved EBS remission for the placebo group and not having achieved EBS remission for the 
filgotinib groups. 
Multiple Imputation 
Subjects in the FAS, who did not have sufficient data to decide on EBS remission status at Week 10 for 
the induction studies or Week 58 for the Maintenance Study, were imputed using the multiple 
imputation procedure. A logistic regression model was used to perform the imputation with baseline 
values of EBS sub scores, treatment, and stratification factors as independent variables. 
Analysis Excluding US/Korea Non-Dual Refractory Males (Cohort B Induction Study Only) 
To evaluate the theoretical potential for non-dual refractory subjects to have better disease prognosis 
and a higher chance of response, a sensitivity analysis excluding US/Korea non-dual refractory males 
from the placebo group in the FAS was conducted using the stratified CMH test for the treatment 
comparison between the filgotinib 200 mg and the placebo group on EBS remission at Week 10 in the 
Cohort B Induction Study. 
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The same statistical method described for testing the primary efficacy endpoint was used for testing 
the key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Multiple testing procedure 
To control a family-wise type I error rate at 5% (i.e., α = 0.05) for each individual study, the graphical 
approach {Bretz 2009} to sequentially rejective multiple test procedures was implemented using a 
Bonferroni approach allocating 0.025 (2-sided) to each filgotinib dose group comparison with placebo. 
Due to an unblinded interim futility analysis planned for each induction study (Cohort A and Cohort B), 
an alpha of 0.00001 was spent for each filgotinib dose group comparison to placebo and therefore, a 
nominal p-value <0.02499 (2-sided) was needed to declare statistical significance for the final primary 
analysis of each filgotinib dose group when compared with placebo.  
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 61/178 
 
 
 
Once all hypotheses within the same filgotinib dosing regimen were rejected, then the 0.02499 alpha 
(within each induction study) or 0.025 (in the maintenance study) could be passed on to the other 
regimen’s hypotheses, that is, all hypotheses in the other filgotinib dosing regimen would be tested at 
2-sided 0.04998 (for the induction studies) or 2-sided 0.05 (for the maintenance study) (see figures 
below). If an endpoint within a filgotinib dosing regimen failed to reach statistical significance, then 
formal sequential testing stopped, and only nominal significance were reported for the remaining 
endpoints within that filgotinib dosing regimen. 
Induction Studies (Cohorts A and B):                      Maintenance Study:  
Figure 19 
Testing Strategy for the Primary and Key Secondary Hypotheses 
The primary statistical hypotheses at Weeks 10 and 58 were as follows: 
H1: The EBS remission rate in the filgotinib 200 mg group is equal to the EBS remission rate in the 
placebo group. 
H2: The EBS remission rate in the filgotinib 100 mg group is equal to the EBS remission rate in the 
placebo group. 
If the primary null hypothesis was rejected, then the next key secondary hypothesis in the same 
filgotinib dosing regimen was tested at the same alpha level. In the induction studies there were four, 
and in the maintenance study there were six, key secondary endpoints included in the MTP (see the 
order of key secondary endpoints for the induction and maintenance studies, above).   
Interim analysis 
Interim Futility Analysis: Induction Studies (Cohorts A and B) 
After 175 subjects (35 from placebo group and 70 from each filgotinib treatment group) had completed 
Week 10 assessments or discontinued from the study, a pre-planned interim futility analysis was 
conducted with the scope to evaluate the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who had 
achieved endoscopic response (endoscopic sub score of 0 or 1). The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
could recommend terminating a filgotinib dose group or recommend stopping the study if the observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 62/178 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of subjects who had achieved endoscopic response in one or both filgotinib dose groups was 
less than that in the placebo group. To protect the integrity of the study due to the unblinded interim 
futility analysis planned for each induction study, an alpha of 0.00001 was to be spent for each 
filgotinib dose group comparison to placebo within each induction study. 
DMC Cohorts A and B End-of-Induction Analysis 
An end-of-induction analysis of efficacy and safety was performed when all subjects in the Cohort A 
Induction Study and Cohort B Induction Study completed Week 10 or discontinued from the studies. 
Both cohorts was to be examined independently by DMC and, taking into account data in Cohort A and 
Cohort B, if both dosing groups (200 mg and 100 mg) in both cohorts (independently examined) failed 
to reach statistical significance compared to placebo on EBS remission, the DMC could recommend 
overall study discontinuation. 
Analysis of Exploratory Health-Related Quality of Life Endpoints 
Health-related quality of life questionnaires included SF-36, WPAI, EQ-5D, and IBDQ, and were 
collected at baseline, Week 10, Week 26, and Week 58. 
Change from baseline at Week 10 (the induction studies) and change from re-baseline at Weeks 26 
and 58 (the maintenance study) of HRQoL endpoints were analysed using ANCOVA models including 
treatment, stratification factors and baseline/re-baseline score as covariates. In the analyses, missing 
values were imputed using a LOCF approach. Estimated means and differences between treatment 
groups were presented with 95% CIs and nominal p-values.  
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoints for each individual study (Cohort 
A Induction Study, Cohort B Induction Study, and Maintenance Study).  
If the value of the grouping variable could not be determined for a subject, this subject was excluded 
from the corresponding subgroup analysis. Non-stratified risk difference between treatment groups 
was evaluated for each of the subgroups using Fisher’s exact test. The non-stratified risk difference 
and 95% CI using normal approximation with a continuity correction on the treatment differences 
(filgotinib − placebo) in EBS remission rates for each of the subgroups was graphically presented by 
Forest plot. 
Changes from Planned Analyses 
Protocol Amendment 5 (02 April 2019) stated that a review of the results of all primary and key 
secondary endpoints of the Cohort A Induction Study and Cohort B Induction Study would be 
performed by a Gilead executive team in parallel with the DMC’s review of the end-of-induction 
analysis. This review by a Gilead executive team was not performed due to concerns raised by 
regulatory authorities during protocol review. No Gilead executive team member or GS-US-418-3898 
study team member had access to any unblinded study results prior to study completion and database 
finalization/lock.

Table 26 GS-US-418-3898: Subject Disposition, Maintenance Study (All Subjects who 
Completed the Induction Studies) 
A total of 150 subjects (74.3%) in the filgotinib 200mg group completed study drug dosing through 
Week 58 compared with 41 subjects (41.4%) in the respective placebo group, and 104 subjects 
(58.1%) in the filgotinib 100mg group completed study drug dosing through Week 58 compared with 
42 subjects (46.2%) in the respective placebo group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of 
study drug were protocol-specified disease worsening (filgotinib 200mg: 34 subjects, 16.8%; 
respective placebo: 49 subjects, 49.5%; filgotinib 100mg: 53 subjects, 29.6%; respective placebo: 
39subjects, 42.9%) and AE (filgotinib 200mg: 7 subjects, 3.5%; respective placebo: 2 subjects, 2.0%; 
filgotinib 100mg: 10 subjects, 5.6%; respective placebo: 4 subjects, 4.4%) 
Disease worsening: Disease worsening was based on the following criteria:  
• 
partial MCS score (all components of MCS except for endoscopic subscore) increase of ≥ 3 
points to at least 5 points from the Week 10 value on two consecutive visits, or an increase to 
9 points on two consecutive visits if the Week 10 value is >6. (The disease worsening visits 
may include unscheduled visits (eg, a study visit followed by an unscheduled visit, or 2 
sequential unscheduled visits anytime from Week 11 onward). 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021

•  Disease worsening to the extent that the subject clinically requires medications prohibited by 
the study (at investigator discretion, with discussion with medical monitor if feasible); these 
subjects do not qualify for the LTE study.

Protocol Deviations 
Cohort A Induction Study: A total of 135 subjects (20.5%) had at least 1 important protocol deviation 
(IPD) during the study. The most common IPD classification was eligibility criteria violation (75 
subjects, 11.4%). The most common eligibility violations were stool samples positive for ova and 
parasites (25 subjects, 3.8%) and use of prohibited medications (15 subjects, 2.3%). Protocol 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 69/178 
 
 
 
deviations were proportionately distributed across treatment groups.  None of these IPDs affected the 
overall quality or interpretation of the study data.  
After database lock, the study ePRO vendor ERT Health Care Company identified diary data from one 
Subject that were not available when the database was locked at study completion. These diary entries 
for RB and SF sub scores did not fall into the SAP-defined analysis calculation window for baseline MCS 
and therefore the omission of these diary entries had no impact on data analysis. This omission was 
not categorized as an IPD according to the prespecified IPD plan. 
Cohort B Induction Study: A total of 231 subjects (33.4%) had at least 1 IPD during the study. The 
most common IPD classification was eligibility criteria violation (149 subjects, 21.6%). The most 
common eligibility violations were use of prohibited medications (51 subjects, 7.4%) and stool samples 
positive for ova and parasites (38 subjects, 5.5%). Protocol deviations were proportionately distributed 
across treatment groups. None of these IPDs affected the overall quality or interpretation of the study 
data. After database lock, the study ePRO vendor ERT Health Care Company identified diary data from 
one Subject that were not available when the database was locked at study completion. This subject 
was a screen failure and therefore the omission of these diary entries had no impact on data analysis. 
This omission was not categorized as an IPD according to the prespecified IPD plan 
Maintenance Study: A total of 65 subjects (9.8 %) had at least 1 IPD during the study. The most 
common IPD classification was missing data (24 subjects, 3.6%). Protocol deviations were 
proportionately distributed across treatment groups. None of these IPDs affected the overall quality or 
interpretation of the study data. 
Compliance 
Treatment Compliance – Cohort A Induction Study: The mean on-treatment adherence rates to study 
drugs were similar across treatment groups, and over 98% of subjects in all treatment groups had on-
treatment adherence rates of ≥ 80% throughout the course of the study. 
Treatment Compliance – Cohort B Induction Study: The mean on-treatment adherence rates to study 
drugs were similar across treatment groups, and over 98% of subjects in all treatment groups had on-
treatment adherence rates of ≥ 80% throughout the course of the study. 
Treatment Compliance – Maintenance Study: The mean on-treatment adherence rates to study drugs 
were similar across treatment groups, and over 97% of subjects in all treatment groups had on-
treatment adherence rates of ≥ 80% throughout the course of the study.

statistically significant for the primary and key secondary endpoints at Week 10. 
Primary endpoint 
Table 36 GS-US-418-3898: Proportion of Subjects with EBS Remission at Week 10, Cohort A 
Induction Study (Non-responder Imputation; Full Analysis Set
Sensitivity analyses:  
When locally read endoscopic subscore was used to assess EBS remission instead of the centrally read 
sub score, the treatment effect of filgotinib compared with placebo was greater for both filgotinib 200 
mg and filgotinib 100mg: 
The number of subjects with missing primary efficacy data, which was not due to early termination or 
treatment failure, was small and balanced across treatment groups; however, a higher proportion of 
subjects in the placebo group had missing primary efficacy data due to early termination compared 
with the filgotinib groups (filgotinib 200 mg: 2.9%; filgotinib 100mg: 5.1%; placebo: 5.8%). As the 
MAH states this limits the interpretation of the results of sensitivity analyses using different approaches 
to impute missing data. The estimated treatment differences between filgotinib and placebo for EBS 
remission using observed cases only or the multiple imputation method were consistent with the 
primary analysis results for both filgotinib 200 mg and filgotinib 100 mg. When using missing = 
success, or missing = success for placebo and missing = failure for filgotinib, the treatment effect of 
filgotinib compared with placebo was smaller for both filgotinib 200 mg and filgotinib 100 mg.

Induction Study were included in the Biomarker Analysis Set. Decreases from baseline in hs-CRP 
values were observed at 2 weeks after starting treatment with filgotinib in both the filgotinib 200 mg 
and filgotinib 100 mg groups. From baseline to Week 10, greater decreases in faecal calprotectin were 
observed in both the filgotinib 200 mg and filgotinib 100 mg groups compared with the placebo group.

Sensitivity analysis primary endpoint 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed and included analyses based on the PP 
Analysis Set, locally read endoscopic subscore instead of centrally read subscore, and different missing 
data imputation rules (ie, observed cases only, missing= success, missing= success for placebo and 
missing= failure for filgotinib, and multiple imputation).  
When locally read endoscopic subscore was used to assess EBS remission instead of the centrally read 
subscore, the treatment effect of filgotinib compared with placebo was greater for both filgotinib 200 
mg and filgotinib 100mg.

Maintenance Study (GS-US-418-3898) 
Primary endpoint 
Based on the prespecified hypothesis testing order, statistically significant treatment differences 
between filgotinib 200 mg and placebo at Week 58 were observed for the primary and all key 
secondary endpoints. Treatment differences between filgotinib 100mg and respective placebo were 
statistically significant for the primary endpoint, but not for the key secondary endpoints at Week 58. A 
summary of results for the primary and key secondary endpoints in the Maintenance Study is provided 
in the tables below. 
Disease worsening starting at 11 weeks of therapy was based on the following criteria:  
• 
• 
partial MCS score (all components of MCS except for endoscopic subscore) increase of ≥ 3 
points to at least 5 points from the Week 10 value on two consecutive visits, or an increase to 
9 points on two consecutive visits if the Week 10 value is >6. 
The disease worsening visits may include unscheduled visits (eg, a study visit followed by an 
unscheduled visit, or 2 sequential unscheduled visits anytime from Week 11 onward). 
•  Disease worsening to the extent that the subject clinically requires medications prohibited by 
the study (at investigator discretion, with discussion with medical monitor if feasible); these 
subjects do not qualify for the LTE study.

Sensitivity analyses 
When locally read endoscopic subscore was used to assess EBS remission instead of the centrally read 
subscore, the treatment effect of filgotinib compared with placebo was greater for both filgotinib 200 
mg and filgotinib 100 mg;  
Higher proportions of subjects who were re-randomised from filgotinib in the induction studies to 
placebo in the Maintenance Study prematurely discontinued study drug compared with subjects who 
continued on filgotinib: 25.7% in the filgotinib 200 mg group compared with 58.6% in the respective 
placebo group, and 41.9% in the filgotinib 100 mg group compared with 53.8% in the respective 
placebo group). Even with these different rates of discontinuation across treatment groups, the 
estimated treatment differences between filgotinib and placebo for EBS remission using different 
missing value imputation methods were consistent with the primary analysis results for both filgotinib 
200 mg and filgotinib 100mg, with the exception of a lower EBS remission rate in the filgotinib 100 mg

GS-US-418-3899: Key Dates 
This is an ongoing long-term extension study in adult male and female subjects with UC who had 
completed or discontinued Study GS-US-418-3898 due to protocol-specified efficacy discontinuation 
criteria. The study was designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, association of clinical response with 
inflammatory biomarkers, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of filgotinib in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC. The treatment administered (oral tablet) in Study GS-US-418-3899 
depended on whether the subject completed, had disease worsening, or was a non-responder in Study 
GS-US-418-3898.  
Subjects who completed Study GS-US-418-3898 continued blinded dosing at the same dosing regimen 
in Study GS-US-418-3899; filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo once daily. After 
unblinding, subjects who were receiving blinded placebo were discontinued and subjects who were 
receiving blinded filgotinib continued the same dose of open label filgotinib.  
Subjects who exited Study GS-US-418-3898 due to disease worsening or failure to meet response or 
remission criteria at Week 10 received open-label filgotinib 200 mg in Study GS-US-418-3899. The 
exception to this was males in the United States and Korea with disease worsening or failure to meet 
response criteria who were not dual refractory (having failed any tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
antagonist and vedolizumab); these male subjects received open-label filgotinib 100 mg in Study GS-
US-418-3899.  
A total of 1164 subjects were enrolled in the study and 1161 subjects received at least 1dose of study 
drug. As of the data cut-off date (28 February 2020), 347 subjects (29.9%) had prematurely 
discontinued study drug. 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study was: 
• 
To observe the long-term safety of filgotinib in subjects who have completed or met protocol-
specified efficacy discontinuation criteria in a prior Gilead-sponsored filgotinib treatment study 
in UC 
The secondary objective of this study was: 
• 
To evaluate the effect of filgotinib on partial Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) 
The exploratory objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the association of clinical response (based on partial MCS) on systemic or localized 
inflammatory biomarkers (eg, including but not limited to high-sensitivity C- reactive protein 
(hs- CRP), faecal calprotectin, faecal lactoferrin, and faecal MMP-9 
To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL)

Statistical Methods: 
A planned interim analysis was performed when this study was unblinded. No formal hypothesis testing 
was planned, and there was no sample size calculation. All subjects who had completed or met 
protocol-specified efficacy discontinuation criteria in Study GS-US-418-3898 were eligible to enrol, 
provided they also met the LTE study eligibility criteria. 
The Safety Analysis Set was the primary analysis set for all efficacy and safety analyses, which 
included all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The secondary endpoint for 
this study was change from baseline in partial MCS. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize 
absolute values and change from baseline values in partial MCS by analysis visit and treatment group 
using observed values only. Exploratory endpoints for HRQoL included the change from baseline in SF-
36, EQ-5D, IBDQ, and percent impairment in WPAI. 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
Table 46 GS-US-418-3899: Disposition of Subjects (All Enrolled Analysis Set)
In the Safety Analysis Set, the mean (SD) age of subjects was 44 (13.6) years. The majority of 
subjects were <65 years old (92.8%), male (59.2%), and most subjects were white (70.5%) or Asian 
(24.3%). Overall, most subjects (87.2%) were from countries outside of the US.  
The mean (SD) partial MCS at baseline by treatment groups was as follows:  
• 
• 
filgotinib 200 mg, 5.1 (2.47)  
filgotinib 100 mg, 2.8 (2.57) 
Assessment report

Page 119/178 
 
 
 
 
• 
and placebo, 1.5 (1.34).  
The mean (SD) faecal calprotectin at baseline for the filgotinib200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo 
were 1872 (3074.0) μg/g, 903 (1271.0) μg/g, 500 (789.3) μg/g, respectively.  
The mean (SD) hs-CRP at baseline for the filgotinib200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo were 7.93 
(14.777) mg/L, 6.25 (11.920) mg/L, and 4.09 (7.776) mg/L, respectively. 
Overall, 224 subjects (19.3%) were on systemic corticosteroids only, 224 subjects (19.3%) were on 
immunomodulators only, and 60 subjects (5.2%) were on both systemic corticosteroids and 
immunomodulators.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Jyseleca (filgotinib) for the treatment 
of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
This application is supported by data from one phase 2b/3 study, GS-US-418-3898 (SELECTION), 
which was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre study that consisted of two 
induction studies and one randomised withdrawal maintenance study. Although the EMA Guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1) on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of 
Ulcerative Colitis states that “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, it is expected that 
at least two confirmatory trials are provided”, the two induction studies in the GS-US-418-3898 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 120/178 
 
 
 
 
(SELECTION) study are conducted in two separate cohorts and thus, the CHMP considered that they 
can be acceptable to fulfil the requirements. 
An additional long-term extension study GS-US-418-3899 is currently ongoing.   
Dose response study 
No dose finding studies were performed in patients with UC. The doses selected in the phase 2b/3 
pivotal study in UC are justified on the basis of three elements: 
•  Results from a Phase 2 Study in patients with established, clinically active Crohn’s disease, 
combined with the assumption that the targeted inflammatory pathways are similar between 
CD and UC.  
• 
• 
Exposure-Response analysis using data from the phase 2b/3 study in patients with moderately 
to severely active UC 
Efficacy and safety results from the phase 2b/3 study in patients with moderately to severely 
active UC 
The CHMP considered that the overall data on the Phase 2 Study in patients with Crohn’s disease are 
limited. Only one dose of filgotinib (200 mg QD) was evaluated in the first part of the study which was 
adequately powered to detect a treatment difference versus placebo at Week 10. In addition, the 100 
mg QD dose was evaluated in the second part of the study only. However, this part was not powered 
to detect a treatment difference versus placebo, nor a treatment difference between the two filgotinib 
doses (100 mg QD and 200 mg QD). The results are only exploratory so a proper assessment of the 
treatment effect of the 100 mg QD dose cannot be made. Finally, the assumption that the targeted 
inflammatory pathways are similar between CD and UC cannot be definitely endorsed by the CHMP. 
With respect to the Exposure-Response analysis, the MAH explored two doses only. In addition, no 
exposure-efficacy relationship was observed for the primary or key secondary endpoints in the 
induction studies and the maintenance study when analyses were conducted by dose. A lack of a 
consistent exposure-safety relationship was observed across doses or by dose. Exposure-efficacy 
analyses using combined data from the two filgotinib doses showed a positive trend for correlation 
between the AUCeff quartile groups and the proportions of patients who achieved 
endoscopy/bleeding/stool frequency (EBS) remission in the induction studies and the maintenance 
study. Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion no relevant conclusion can be drawn regarding the 
adequate dose based on those data.  
However, the efficacy and safety results of the pivotal phase 2b/3 study GS-US-418-3898 were 
considered sufficient by the CHMP to determine the dosing regimen. See below. 
Main study 
The Cohort A Induction Study included biologic-naive subjects and the Cohort B Induction Study 
included biologic-experienced subjects. Both induction studies had a duration of 11 weeks and subjects 
were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo.  
Subjects who completed the induction studies and achieved either endoscopy/bleeding/stool frequency 
(EBS) remission or Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) response at Week 10 were rerandomized into the 
Maintenance Study (Week 11 to Week 58). Subjects who received filgotinib in the induction phase 
were rerandomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on their initially randomised filgotinib dose or 
switch to placebo and subjects who received placebo in the induction studies continued on placebo in 
the maintenance phase.

Patient who did not meet the prespecified criteria for continuation into the maintenance phase, or who 
met disease-worsening criteria in the Maintenance Study, were discontinued from blinded treatment 
and had the option to receive open-label filgotinib 200 mg in Study GS-US-418-3899. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly define patients with moderately to severely active UC (Mayo 
Clinic Score 6 to 12; endoscopy subscore ≥ 2; rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1; stool frequency 
subscore ≥ 1; and Physician’s Global Assessment subscore ≥ 2). Patients were permitted to use stable 
doses of concomitant therapies for UC, including oral aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids (prednisone 
equivalent dose up to 30 mg/day), and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate). In 
the Cohort A study, patients had to previously demonstrated an inadequate clinical response, loss of 
response to, or intolerance to at least one of the following agents: corticosteroids, oral azathioprine, 6-
MP or MTX. In Cohort B study, patient had to previously demonstrated an inadequate clinical response, 
loss of response to, or intolerance to at least one TNF-α antagonist or vedolizumab. 
The CHMP considered that the suggested indication text “Jyseleca is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent” 
adequately reflects the intended population. 
As primary endpoint, the current study uses Endoscopic/Blood/Stool (EBS) remission, a combined 
endpoint derived from the Mayo clinical score (MCS), excluding the PGA. To reach EBS remission, the 
patient requires to have achieved an endoscopic response (a subscore of 0-1), cessation of rectal 
bleeding (subscore 0) and at least a 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a 
subscore of 0 or 1. Although not fully consistent with the recommendations of the applicable guideline 
CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 rev 1 (stating that the endoscopic and clinical remission should be evaluated 
as co-primary endpoints) the above definition of remission is deemed acceptable by the CHMP because 
it did encompass both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and the sub-scoring levels chosen are 
consistent with the guideline, which states that a score of 0 or 1 may be used for defining endoscopic 
healing and symptomatic remission should include cessation of rectal bleeding. Some more stringent 
definition could have been used, such as endoscopic remission, but this is included as secondary 
outcome. The study also started before the publication of the updated EMA guideline. However, since 
the EMA guideline states that clinical (symptoms) and endoscopic remission should be evaluated as co-
primary endpoints, additional analysis was requested to further evaluate the contributions of the 
different parts of the composite EBS-remission endpoint to the overall results (see below). 
In addition, the study has several key secondary endpoints, based on different parts of the MCS and 
also histologic remission which is appreciated. Quality of Life and biomarkers are exploratory 
endpoints. The CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 guideline requires that for a claim of “maintenance of 
remission”, it needs to be demonstrated that patients being in complete remission at study entry 
remain in remission throughout a full 52-week study period. As the maintenance study included both 
responders and remitters after induction, the most relevant endpoints for this assessment are 
therefore the key secondary endpoints sustained remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission. 
Globally, the objectives and endpoints of the SELECTION study are acceptable; however, the MAH was 
requested by the CHMP to further justify the histologic remission endpoint and to provide its definition. 
The MAH clarified that they referred to the recent ECCO position paper on the Harmonization of the 
Approach to Ulcerative Colitis Histopathology (Magro 2020). The definition of histologic remission in 
study GS-US-418-3898 incorporated a mild increase of inflammation, absence of 
neutrophils/erosion/ulceration and absence of crypt destruction. It is therefore broadly consistent with 
the ECCO position paper and was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The secondary endpoints time to remission and time to response recommended in EMA guideline 
CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 was not included in the study outcomes. However, the MAH referred to the 
analyses first presented in the final report of the clinical study GS-US641863898 (SELECTION). They 
describe changes from baseline in the stool frequency and rectal bleeding sub scores of the primary 
endpoint MCS through week 10 of the induction studies, and changes from baseline in serum CRP and 
fecal calprotectin levels through week 10 of the induction studies.  
The study was conducted at 341 study centres in 40 countries. Study Start Date was 14 November 
2016 and study End Date 31 March 2020.   
In Cohort A induction study (biologic naïve subjects) 1090 subjects were screened, and 660 subjects 
were randomized (245 patients received 200mg filgotinib, 277 patients received 100mg filgotinib and 
137 patients received placebo). Overall, 630 subjects (94.8%) completed study drug dosing through 
week 10 and 618 subjects (93.8%) completed the cohort A introduction study. The main reasons for 
study drug discontinuation were subject decision and AEs, with a similar distribution between 
randomized groups. 
In Cohort B induction study (biologic experienced subjects) 950 subjects were screened, and 691 
subjects were randomized (262 patients received 200mg filgotinib, 285 patients received 100mg 
filgotinib and 143 patients received placebo). Overall, 623 subjects (90.4%) completed the cohort B 
introduction study. The main reasons for study drug discontinuation were AEs and subject’s decision. 
Of the 1241 subjects who completed the induction studies, 664 subjects continued to the maintenance 
study (53.5%). The 571 subjects treated with filgotinib in the induction phase were rerandomized in a 
2:1 ratio to either continue on the assigned filgotinib regimen or switch to placebo. The 93 subjects 
who were treated with placebo in the induction phase continued with placebo treatment also during the 
maintenance phase. A total of 401 patients (60.4%) completed the maintenance phase, numerically 
more in the filgotinib/filgotinib 200 mg group (150/202, 74.3%) than in the filgotinib/filgotinib 100 mg 
group (104/179, 58.1%) and the placebo groups (filgotinib 200mg/placebo 41/99, 41.4%, filgotinib 
100mg/placebo 42/91 46.2% and placebo/placebo group 64/93, 68.8%). The main reason for 
discontinuation were disease worsening (filgotinib 200mg: 34 subjects, 16.8%; respective placebo: 49 
subjects, 49.5%; filgotinib 100mg: 53 subjects, 29.6%; respective placebo: 39subjects, 42.9%)   
In the Cohort A induction study, the mean (SD) age of subjects was 42 (13.1) years. Fewer than half 
of subjects were female (44.3%) and most subjects were white (68.6%) or Asian (29.4%). Most 
subjects (90.0%) were from countries outside of the US. Demographics and other baseline 
characteristics were balanced across treatment groups except for slightly more woman in the placebo 
group that does not have any impact on the overall result. The mean (SD) duration of UC from 
diagnosis to first dose of study drugs was 6.8 (7.20) years. Mean (SD) MCS at baseline was 8.6 (1.36), 
and 52.4% of subjects had an MCS ≥ 9. In total, 55.8% of subjects had an endoscopic subscore of 3 
at baseline. Thus, the study population comprises of patients with an active moderate to severe 
disease which are in line with the proposed indication.  
With respect to concomitant immunosuppressant use, the proportions of subjects taking 
immunomodulators at baseline were 29.7% (only immunomodulators 22.6% and in combination with 
systemic corticosteroids 7.1%). 23.5% had systemic corticosteroids only. The proportion of subjects 
with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at baseline was evenly 
distributed across treatment groups. 
In the Cohort B Induction study, the mean (SD) age of subjects was 43 (14.4) and 39% were female.  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups in both 
cohorts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021

The mean (SD) duration of UC from diagnosis to first dose of study drugs was 9.8 (7.56) years. Mean 
(SD) MCS at baseline was 9.3 (1.35), and 73.7% of subjects had an MCS ≥ 9. In total, 77.8% of 
subjects had an endoscopic subscore of 3 at baseline. It is not unexpected that this cohort, consisting 
of biologic experienced patients, have a higher disease activity and longer disease duration than 
biologic naïve patients. Prior use and prior failure of a TNF-α antagonist was reported for 92.6% and 
85.5% of subjects. Prior use and prior failure of vedolizumab was reported for 57.2% and 51.7% of 
subjects. Prior use of both a TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab was reported for 50.9% of subjects 
and prior failure of both a TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab was reported for 43.1% of subjects.  
The use of at least 3 biologic agents was reported in 30.9% of subjects.  
With respect to concomitant immunosuppressant use, the proportions of subjects taking 
immunomodulators was 22.6% (only immunomodulators 12.9% or in combination with systemic 
corticosteroids 9.7%). 36.0 % were taking only systemic corticosteroids and 41.4% of subjects were 
taking neither systemic corticosteroids nor immunomodulators. The proportions of subjects with 
concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at baseline and the proportions of 
subjects previously exposed to 1 biologic agent or >1 biologic agent at baseline were evenly 
distributed across treatment groups. 
Thus, the cohort B consist of a population with a high disease activity despite previous use of biologics. 
Almost a third of the patients (30.9%) had used at least 3 biologics and half of the patients (50.9%) 
had used both a TNF inhibitor and vedolizumab. 
Statistical aspects study GS-US-418-3898 
In the induction studies, an interim analysis for futility was planned and seemingly also performed 
after 175 subjects had completed week 10 assessments or discontinued from the study. At the time, 
the data monitoring committee (DMC) could have recommend terminating a filgotinib dose group or 
recommended stopping the study if the observed proportion of subjects who had achieved endoscopic 
response in one or both filgotinib dose groups was less than that in the placebo group; the study did 
however complete according to plan. An unblinded interim End-of-Induction Analysis for a prespecified 
sponsor’s executive team review for the purpose of sponsor decision making and future development 
planning for filgotinib was first added but shortly after removed (protocol amendment 5.0 and 5.1 
respectively). The removal was considered acceptable to the CHMP.  
There are no concerns regarding randomisation or masking of treatments. With filgotinib available as 
200 mg and 100 mg strength tablets, blinding was to be achieved using double-dummy technique and 
should have been appropriate. The sample size estimations seem overall to have been appropriate. 
The actual sample size in the maintenance study depended on the outcome in the induction cohorts. 
An induction response rate of 55% was assumed among filgotinib treated subjects and thereby that 
approximately 285 subjects from each filgotinib dose group from cohorts A and B combined could be 
eligible for re-randomisation into the maintenance study. In the end, 297 from the 200 mg filgotinib 
dose group and 261 from the 100 mg filgotinib dose group were re-randomised and included in the 
primary analysis set. Subjects who received placebo in the induction studies and were eligible for the 
Maintenance Study continued on placebo; they were not included in the primary analysis of the 
maintenance study.  
SAP version 3.0 was dated 28 April 2020, i.e. close to but before database finalisation and treatment 
unblinding (5 and 6 May 2020). Planned analyses are overall agreed. Previous SAP versions have been 
submitted including a section describing SAP revisions. Overall, no concerns are raised; changes made 
foremost concerned clarifications or modifications not considered to have any major impact on primary 
conclusions. The multiple testing procedure was initially planned to use Bonferroni alone but was 
updated to allow alpha recycling between the two testing sequences for the two filgotinib doses. This 
Assessment report

update concerned both the two induction cohorts and the maintenance study and is agreed. To protect 
the integrity of the study due to the unblinded interim futility analysis planned for each induction 
study, an alpha adjustment of 0.00001 was used for each filgotinib dose group comparison to placebo 
implying that comparisons (within each induction study) was performed using a two-sided significance 
level of 0.02499. While an alpha spending approach is generally not expected in terms of futility 
analyses, there is no objection against. 
The most important endpoints were all binary and used a failure imputation approach. Within the 
induction cohorts, most subjects completed study drug dosing through week 10. Several sensitivity 
analyses for the primary endpoint was planned and have been performed (both induction cohorts and 
the maintenance study). These are overall appreciated in that they represent a number of 
assumptions, including the more (most) extreme worst case (filgotinib)/best case (placebo) 
imputation. Overall, most subjects completed the induction studies; more subjects did however 
discontinue in the placebo arms compared with subjects in the active arms and more subjects 
discontinued in the 100 mg arm compared with the 200 mg arm. 
The multiple testing procedures comprised, besides the primary endpoint, a number of key secondary 
endpoints. The multiplicity testing procedure set in the trial is endorsed within each phase of the trial 
(induction and maintenance). The reasons for no type-one error control between the induction and 
maintenance stage were not discussed; however, this issue has not been further pursued by the CHMP 
since this would not impact the final decision.  
The change-from-baseline analyses of HRQoL endpoints used LOCF. This is not a preferred choice of 
method to handle cases where data was missing. For the maintenance study, sensitivity analyses were 
provided and performed using BOCF; assuming no treatment effect and hence that subjects 
maintained their baseline HRQoL status as when they were randomised. Since subjects at 
randomisation had to be responders this approach is sufficiently conservative because of more subjects 
with missing week 58 data in the placebo arm than in active arms. The omittance of sensitivity 
analyses for the induction studies was accepted by the CHMP. Here, the amount of missing data was 
more limited and the use of LOCF actually implied BOCF due to that there was only one post-baseline 
measurement.  
Maintenance study only 
In the Maintenance study compared with induction studies, there were many more subjects that 
prematurely discontinued study drug/the study. Most of them, both in the placebo as well as in the 
200 mg arm, did so due to a protocol-specified disease worsening. Given the nonetheless much higher 
proportion of subjects in the placebo arm fulfilling this criterion during maintenance, a difference 
between 200 mg and placebo was evident also in the worst case/best case sensitivity analysis. The 
criteria of disease worsening have been found acceptable. 
Long-term extension study GS-US-418-3899 
Subjects who completed the Week 58 visit in the Maintenance Study had the option to continue study 
drug in a blinded fashion in the long-term extension study which is still ongoing. Treatment 
assignments for subjects continuing in study GS-US-418-3899 was unblinded only after study GS-US-
418-3898 was unblinded. At the time of unblinding, subjects who were receiving placebo in GS-US-
418-3899 were discontinued and subjects who were receiving filgotinib treatment continued on the 
same dose of open-label filgotinib treatment.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose selection  
The overall data from the Phase 2 Study in patients with Crohn’s disease (GLPG0634-CL-211) are 
limited and no relevant conclusion can be drawn from the Exposure-response relationships evaluated 
based on data from the phase 2b/3 study (GS-US-418-3898) in patients with UC. However, based on 
the efficacy and safety results of the pivotal phase 2b/3 study GS-US-418-3898, the CHMP agreed that 
the 200mg dose once daily regimen was appropriate in the claimed indication. 
Main study 
In the biologic naïve patients (Cohort A study), the primary endpoint, EBS remission at week 10, 
was achieved by 26.1% in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 19.1% in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 
15.3% in the placebo group. Only the higher dose, filgotinib 200mg, was statistical significantly better 
than placebo (difference in proportions were 10.8% (95% CI: 2.1% to 19.5%, p = 0.0157).  The 
results from all the key secondary endpoints were in line with the results from the primary endpoint. It 
is noted that although only 12.2% achieved endoscopic remission (i.e. mayo endoscopic score 0), 
33.9% achieved endoscopic response (score 0-1), an outcome that often are defined as mucosal 
healing (exploratory endpoint and also the endoscopic part of the EBS-score). In the placebo group the 
proportion were 3.6% for endoscopic remission and 20.4% for endoscopic response. Histologic 
remission was seen in 35% of patients in filgotinib 200mg group and 16% in the placebo group 
(difference in proportions were 19% (95% CI 9.9% to 28.2%, P<0.0001). At the CHMP’s request, the 
MAH was asked to clarify why histologic remission is achieved at a later timepoint than both clinical 
and endoscopic remission. The MAH pointed out that the poor correlation between histologic findings 
and clinical or endoscopic indices of activity for UC are historically known. In particular, the recent 
article by Lemmens notes that endoscopic and histologic changes should be seen as 2 dynamic 
processes not necessarily running completely in parallel. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
In addition, all exploratory endpoints showed numerically greater efficacy for filgotinib 200 mg than 
placebo. Of note, the patients who achieved a MCS response at week 10 were allowed to proceed to 
the maintenance study. The proportions of patients achieving a MCS response were 66.5% (163/245) 
in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 59.2% (164/277) in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 46.7 (64/137) in 
the placebo group. Although numerically more patients in the filgotinib groups, especially filgotinib 200 
mg, achieved a MCS response at week 10, it is noted that not an insignificant proportion of patients in 
the placebo group achieved MCS response at week 10 and were allowed to proceed into the 
maintenance study.  
There were numerical differences in favour for filgotinib in several parts of the patient reported 
outcomes related to Quality of life and upon CHMP request, the MAH provided additional information 
regarding the number and proportion of patients achieving minimal clinical important difference 
(MCID) in these endpoints. Minimal clinically important difference was defined as an increase from 
induction baseline of the following: ≥ 16 in the IBDQ total score, ≥ 5 in the respective SF-36 physical 
component summary or mental component summary, and ≥ 10 in the EQ-5D-VAS, and a decrease of 
≥ 7% from induction baseline in each WPAI domain score. The proportion of patients achieving a MCID 
were in general higher in the filgotinib group versus the placebo group with the exception of WPAI, 
where the proportion of patients achieving a MCID in absenteeism, presenteeism and work productivity 
loss were similar in the filgotinib and the placebo group. 
In the biologic experienced patients (Cohort B study), EBS remission at week 10 was achieved by 
11.5% in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 9.5% in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 4.2% in the placebo

group. Also, in this cohort, only the higher dose, filgotinib 200mg, was statistical significantly better 
than placebo (difference in proportion was 7.2% (CI 1.6% to 12.8%, p=0.013). None of the key 
secondary endpoints were statistically significant in this patient group, although it is noted that for 
histologic remission there was a numerically increase in favour for filgotinib 200 mg 19.8% vs 8.5%. 
Only 3.4% and 17.2% patients achieved endoscopic remission and endoscopic response. Although this 
patient group consisted of patients with a more severe disease, resistant to biologic therapies (50% of 
the patients had received both a TNF-inhibitor and vedolizumab), the clinical relevance of the modest 
efficacy seen in this patient group was questioned by the CHMP. In particular, there was a concern that 
the endpoint considered to be predictive for the long-term outcome/prognosis of the patients 
(endoscopic improvement/remission) was not achieved at a relevantly higher rate with filgotinib as 
compared to placebo. The MAH clarified these findings and provided additional information. When 
clinical and endoscopic response were analysed separately, it was obvious that the main efficacy result 
achieved from the endpoint EBS-remission was mainly based on the symptomatic response (36.3% vs 
10.6%, difference in proportions 26.6 (18.6 to 34.6)). However, a numerically better response could 
be seen also in the endoscopic part of the EBS-remission endpoint, 17.2% vs 7.7% difference in 
proportions 9.4 (2.5 to 16.7). The additional information provided by the MAH regarding mucosal 
healing (defined as endoscopic response in combination with histological remission), showing that a 
numerically greater proportion of biologic-experienced subjects achieved mucosal healing in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group compared with the placebo group both at week 10 (9.9% versus 4.2%, 
difference in proportion 6.0 (0.4 to 11.7)) and at Week 58 (22.8% vs 4.5%, difference in proportion 
18.3 (6.0 to 30.0)), added further evidence that a beneficial effect is seen also on the mucosa. It may 
be expected that this patient group could achieve clinical remission at a later timepoint, and it is noted 
that more than half of the patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group (53.1%) achieved MCS response at 
week 10. In the filgotinib 100 mg and placebo group, 35.8% respectively 17.6% achieved MCS 
response at week 10. These patients were allowed to proceed to the maintenance study.  
It is acknowledged that the cohort B study population included a significant proportion of patients who 
were very treatment resistant to biologic agents. It can also be agreed that, among the populations in 
registrational UC trials to date, it was the most refractory with a substantial prior treatment history of 
biologic therapies and a high disease burden at baseline. Results of the subgroup analysis by history of 
biologic agent use show that the treatment effect of filgotinib 200mg is reduced in refractory patients, 
in particular patients with prior failure to vedolizumab and dual refractory patients (with prior failure of 
both TNF-α antagonist and vedolizumab). Upon request from CHMP, results of the subgroup analysis of 
EBS remission endpoint by history of biologic agent use were included in SmPC section 5.1 to 
adequately inform the prescriber on this issue. 
The findings from the two induction studies support the suggested posology 200mg for both biologic 
naïve and experienced patients in the induction phase. 
The CHMP recognized that the variability of the data is high. Although a clear conclusion on the time to 
remission and time to response has not been established, declines in symptom scores and biomarkers 
are found to occur as early as week 2, reflecting a fairly rapid effect of filgotinib. 
To substantiate the contributions of clinical and endoscopic parts to the total EBS-score, the MAH was 
asked to evaluate the numbers and proportions of patients in clinical remission (i.e. patients with at 
least a 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 and a rectal 
bleeding score 0) and numbers and proportions of patients in endoscopic response (i.e. mayo 
endoscopic score 0-1) separately and discuss the findings in relation to the total EBS-remission 
endpoint. The data provided showed that for both the symptomatic remission and endoscopic 
response, a numerical clinically relevant efficacy was seen. Also, when analysing the two components 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 127/178 
 
 
 
of the symptomatic remission part (rectal bleeding and stool frequency) a numerical difference in 
favour for filgotinib 200 mg was seen. 
Overall, although the main efficacy was seen on the symptoms in the biologic experienced patients, a 
modest efficacy was also seen when evaluating the response on the mucosa. Since the biologic 
experienced patients population included a rather high proportion of dual-refractory patients, those 
data are reflected in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In the maintenance study, statistically significant treatment differences between filgotinib 200 mg 
and placebo at Week 58 were observed for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. The primary 
endpoint, EBS remission at week 58, was reached by 37.2% of the Filgotinib 200 mg group and 11.2% 
of the placebo group. Difference in proportion was 26.0% (95% CI 16.0% to 35.9%, p< 0.0001).  
The proportions of subjects who achieved 6-month corticosteroid-free EBS remission at Week 58 were 
27.2% in the 200 mg group respective 6.4 % in the placebo group (difference in proportion 20.8% CI 
7.7% to 33.9%). Upon CHMP request, the MAH also provided information regarding numbers and 
proportions of patients in corticosteroid free symptomatic remission at week 58 (42.2% vs 19.1% 
difference in proportions 23.2 (6.5 to 40.0) and with corticosteroid-free endoscopic response at week 
58 (29.3% vs 8.5%, difference in proportions 20.8 (7.0 to 34.7)). This additional analysis consistently 
shows numerical superiority of filgotinib 200 mg over placebo for all endpoints in both biologic-naïve 
and biologic experienced patients. The magnitudes of effects were smaller in the biologic experienced 
patients, but this is generally expected and the “corticosteroid free” remission at week 58 in biologic 
experienced patients is mainly driven by clinical symptoms, not by mucosal healing. Indeed, with 
regard to the proportion of patients with 6-month corticosteroid-free endoscopic response, the 
magnitude of effect is only 6.3% (14.3% (7/49)) versus 8.0% ((2/25), 95%CI= -11.2% to 23.8%), it 
is much larger for the proportion of patients with 6-month corticosteroid-free symptomatic response 
(30.6% (15/49)) versus (12.0% (3/25), difference = 18.6%, 95%CI = -2.5% to 39.8%). Bearing in 
mind that this bio-experienced population was particularly refractory to treatment, the “corticosteroid-
free” benefit observed on the long term in this population can be considered clinically relevant, though 
it is mostly driven by symptoms and to a lesser extent by mucosal healing. 
There were some discrepancies between the number of patients reported to be on corticosteroid 
treatment at the beginning of the maintenance phase and the number of patients included in the 
analyse of the corticosteroid treated patient, and this discrepancies were due to different definition of 
corticosteroid treatment and did not have any impact on the results. In addition, since numerically 
more patients in the placebo group received a corticosteroid dose >20mg (18.2% in the placebo group 
vs 8.4% in the 200 mg group) the MAH provided additional analyses that confirmed that this 
discrepancy did not had any effect on the result. Since patients were considered treatment failures if 
the corticosteroid dose were increased above initial treatment dose, but not otherwise, additional 
information about corticosteroid treated patients were provided by the MAH upon request. Of the 
92 subjects in the maintenance filgotinib 200 mg group who had corticosteroid use at maintenance 
baseline, the majority (58 subjects, 63.0%) had stopped corticosteroid treatment, few subjects had 
not changed (3 subjects, 3.3%) or had reduced (5 subjects, 5.4%) their corticosteroid dose, and no 
subject had increased their corticosteroid dose at Week 58. In the respective placebo group, 14 
subjects (29.8%) had stopped corticosteroid treatment, no subject had reduced their corticosteroid 
dose, and few subjects had increased their corticosteroid dose (1 subject, 2.1%) or had not changed 
their corticosteroid dose (2 subjects, 4.3%) at Week 58. The number of subjects who met the 
treatment failure rule in the Maintenance Study was small, with no apparent discrepancy across 
treatment groups.  
Although statistically significant different from placebo, the proportion of subjects who achieved 
sustained EBS remission at Week 58 seems low, only 18.1% in the Filgotinib 200 mg group and 5.1%

in the respectively placebo group. Upon CHMP request, the MAH provided additional tabulations 
confirming that of the subjects with EBS remission at Week 10 who received filgotinib 200 mg during 
induction and maintenance, 62.1% achieved EBS remission at Week 58.  
In addition, to further explore the benefit of long term/maintenance treatment, the MAH provided 
additional information regarding the patients who achieved MCS-response (but not remission) at week 
10. In that population, 38/141 (27.0%) vs 6/67 (9.7%) and 39/146 (26.7%) vs 4/66 (6.1%) achieved 
EBS- and MCS-remission, respectively, at week 58, thus indicating that additional efficacy could be 
gained for this patient group. In addition, since it is noted that 64/93 (68.8%) of the patients that 
were placebo-responders at week 10 completed the maintenance phase, the MAH provided additional 
information about efficacy also in this population. In the placebo responder group, of the subjects who 
achieved MCS-response (but not remission) at week 10 and continued to the maintenance phase still 
on placebo, 7/61 (11.5%) achieved EBS remission at Week 58 and 8/65 (12.3%) achieved MCS 
remission at Week 58. 
Treatment differences between filgotinib 100mg and respective placebo group were statistically 
significant for the primary endpoint (Filgotinib 100 mg: 23.8%, respective placebo: 13.5%; difference 
in proportions: 10.4%, 95% CI: −0.0% to 20.7%, p = 0.0420), but not for any of the key secondary 
endpoints at Week 58. In addition, 29.6% of the patients in the 100mg group discontinued the 
medication because of disease worsening. This does not support the use of the lower dose for 
maintaining treatment in the overall UC population, but the CHMP noted that the study did not analyse 
the effect of a higher induction dose followed by a lower maintenance dose. Since the clinical course in 
UC usually involves periods of remission interspersed with periods of active disease, the treatment 
approach in UC aims to induce a fast remission followed by maintenance treatment if the patient 
responds. Thus, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH proposed the following points which were considered 
acceptable by the CHMP: 
•  Section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated based on data from the long-term evaluation study to 
suggests 12 additional week of treatment after the initial 10 weeks before discontinuing the 
treatment if no effect is seen.  
• 
The MAH will conduct a study exploring a reduction of maintenance dose in a post-marketing 
setting.   The proposed study would recruit subjects from the ongoing long term extension 
(LTE) study (GS US 418 3899 [SELECTION LTE]) who are in stable glucocorticosteroid free 
partial MCS remission while receiving filgotinib 200 mg daily. These patients would be 
randomized to either 200 mg or 100 mg daily. 
Since the maintenance study was randomized withdrawal study, it is not unsuspected to the CHMP that 
more than 50% of the patients re-randomized from filgotinib to placebo discontinued study drug 
(58.6% in the filgotinib 200 mg/placebo group and 53.8% in the filgotinib 100 mg/placebo group, 
41.9% in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 25.7% in the filgotinib 200 mg group). As described 
previously, the main reason for discontinuation was disease worsening.  
Subgroup analyses indicate efficacy in both bio-naïve and bio experienced patients in the maintenance 
study. The proportion of bio-experienced patients achieving EBS remission at week 58 was 
22/92(23.9%) and the proportion of bio-naïve patients was 52/107 (48.6%). To further explore 
efficacy in this subgroup, the MAH provided the other key secondary endpoints divided in the two 
groups. For the bio-naïve patients, the results were in line with the results achieved in the whole 
population. For the bio-experienced population a numerically greater proportion of biologic-
experienced subjects in the filgotinib 200 mg group achieved a response in the key secondary 
endpoints, although it is noted that for several endpoints the lower bound of CI were close to zero or 
below. However, the CHMP noted that the study was not designed to detect any difference in 
Assessment report

Page 129/178 
 
 
 
subgroups. In general, the point estimate points toward a beneficial effect for filgotinib 200 mg also in 
the bio-experienced population at week 58. 
In addition, the treatment effect of filgotinib 200 mg compared with placebo in establishing EBS 
remission at Week 58 was consistent across all subgroups by stratification, demographic factors, 
disease characteristics, and prior biologic history. A numerically higher proportion of patients achieved 
EBS remission at week 58 compared to placebo in the subgroups of patients with prior failure to TNF-α 
antagonists (22.7% vs 5.3%, difference 17.4%), and prior failure to vedolizumab (27.5% vs 0%), and 
dual refractory (25.8% vs 0%). In order to verify the consistency in establishing sustained EBS 
remission at week 58 and 6-month corticosteroid-free EBS remission at Week 58, the MAH has also 
provided subgroup analyses of sustained EBS remission at week 58 and 6-month corticosteroid-free 
EBS remission at Week 58 by concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators at 
baseline. The CHMP concluded that the treatment effect of filgotinib 200 mg is consistent also across 
these subgroups.  
Long-term extension study GS-US-418-3899  
An interim analysis of the results from the long-term extension study GS-US-418-3899 was provided 
(DLP=05 May 2020, safety analysis set n= 1161, 144 weeks follow-up). The results showed that 
continued treatment with filgotinib 200 mg provided some symptomatic clinical benefit, as evidenced 
by the downward trend in partial MCS from baseline starting at week 2. The improvement in MCS 
appeared to be sustained up to 108 weeks. After that, the number of patients was too small to draw 
conclusions.  In addition, HRQoL evaluations showed trends of improvement. The mean change from 
baseline in partial MCS was greater with filgotinib 200 mg than with filgotinib 100 mg. 
Although the focus of the long-term extension study is safety, some information about efficacy could 
be achieved also from this study and  to further explore the overall benefit of the treatment the MAH 
was asked to provide additional information about the patients that were non responders at week 10 
and continued into the long-term study GS-US-418-3899. The result showed that patients from Cohort 
A and Cohort B achieved partial MCS remission (17.1% and 16.7%, respectively) and partial MCS 
response (65.7% and 62.2%, respectively) after 12 weeks of additional treatment in the LTE study. 
This information has been included in SmPC section 5.1.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant effect as measured by EBS remission has been 
demonstrated for Jyseleca 200 mg QD, both as induction and maintenance treatment, in the target 
population of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic 
agent.  
For patients with previous biological therapy, the treatment effect was modest, and none of the 
secondary endpoints in the induction phase reached statistically significance. This patient group 
consisted of patients with a more severe disease, resistant to biologic therapies, and a lower efficacy in 
this population is thus acceptable.  
Overall, there is support from secondary endpoints measuring different aspects of the disease. 
Finally, the study did not evaluate the effect of a higher induction dose followed by a lower 
maintenance dose and, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH accepted to conduct a study exploring a 
reduction of maintenance dose in a post-marketing setting.

For Cohort 3, safety events that occurred while on a given treatment were assigned to that corresponding 
treatment.  
Assessment report

Adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and marked laboratory abnormalities were reported for 
events that occurred within a study or treatment period and up to 30 days after the last dosing date 
within the same study or treatment period. Long-latency AEs included AEs that occurred after the last 
dosing date + 30-day follow-up and before the first dosing date of the next study, if applicable. 
The exposure-adjusted integrated safety analysis is based on the Safety Analysis Set, which comprises 
all subjects enrolled in Studies GS-US-418-3898 or GS-US-418-3899 who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. By-subject listings of safety data are based on the All Randomized Analysis Set, which 
includes all subjects who were randomized into Cohort A Induction Study or Cohort B Induction Study 
of Study GS-US-418-3898. 
For analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set for Cohort 1, data were grouped according to the 
treatment received in the induction studies: filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo. 
For analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set for Cohort 2, data were grouped according to the 
treatment received in both induction and maintenance studies as follows: filgotinib 200 mg and its 
respective placebo; filgotinib 100 mg and its respective placebo; and placebo only. 
For analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set for Cohort 3, safety events that occurred while on a 
given treatment were assigned to that corresponding treatment. Safety events that occurred after the 
last dosing date across the induction, maintenance, and LTE studies were assigned to the last 
treatment period for the subject. Based on the study designs of Studies GS-US-418-3898 and 
GS-US-418-3899, subjects may have received different treatments (filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 
100 mg, or placebo) in the induction, maintenance, and LTE studies. Accordingly, subjects may have 
contributed to more than 1 treatment group.  
Treatment period was defined as a treatment duration for each treatment a subject received. For 
Cohort 3, whenever there was a switch in treatment regimen, the data collected after the treatment 
switch were assigned to the next treatment period. For example, if a subject received the same 
treatment, such as filgotinib 200 mg throughout Studies GS-US-418-3898 and GS-US-418-3899, the 
subject was considered to have had only 1 treatment period. A subject who received filgotinib 200 mg 
during induction treatment, placebo in the Maintenance Study, and filgotinib 200 mg in 
Study GS-US-418-3899 was considered to have had 3 treatment periods.  
Patient exposure 
In Cohort 1 (combined cohort A and cohort B induction study), overall, 1069 subjects received at least 
1 dose of filgotinib for a total of 221.1 PY, comprising 507 subjects treated with filgotinib 200 mg for 
105.2 PY and 562 subjects treated with filgotinib 100 mg for 115.8 PY. A total of 279 subjects received 
placebo for 57.0 PY.  
For Cohort 2 (maintenance study), overall, 381 subjects received at least 1 dose of filgotinib for a total 
of 270.7 PY, comprising 202 subjects treated with filgotinib 200 mg for 152.4 PY and 179 subjects 
treated with filgotinib 100 mg for 118.3 PY. A total of 99 subjects and 91 subjects were treated with 
the respective placebos for filgotinib 200 mg and filgotinib 100 mg for 54.6 PY and 50.9 PY, 
respectively.  
Overall, a total of 1253 subjects with UC have received at least 1 dose of filgotinib for a total of 
1567.4 PY (table below).

Death included any death that occurred during the study. 
Adverse events were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Version 22.1. 
Severity grades were defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03. 
Multiple AEs were counted only once per subject for the highest severity grade for each preferred term. 
Exact Poisson distribution method was applied to compute the 95% CI of EAIR; the Method of Variance

AE = adverse event; EAER = exposure-adjusted event rate per 100 PYE; EAER* = (number of events/PYE)*100; 
GEE = generalized estimating equations; NEst = not estimable; PYE = patient-years of exposure; 
TE = treatment-emergent; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event 
Adverse events were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Version 22.1. 
Severity grades were defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03.  
Death includes any death that occurred during the study. 
Model-based EAER ratio and corresponding 95% CI were estimated using GEE model for longitudinal count data 
including treatment group adjusted for treatment period and patient population (biologic naive or biologic 
experienced) with an offset of natural log of exposure time. 
Common adverse events 
Summaries of EAIRs for common AEs by preferred term (PT) reported in Cohort 1 (Cohort A Induction 
Study and Cohort B Induction Study Combined) and Cohort 2 (Maintenance Study) are provided in the 
tables below along with a summary of EAERs for common AEs by PT in Cohort 3.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 3 deaths occurred: 2 deaths were reported in Cohort 2 (maintenance phase), both for 
subjects in the filgotinib 200 mg group (left ventricular failure in 1 subject and asthma in 1 subject), 
and 1 additional death was reported in Cohort 3 (overall safety data) for a subject who received 
filgotinib 100 mg in Study GS-US-418-3898 and filgotinib 200 mg in Study GS-US-418-3899 
(myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke). The details of the deaths are as follows: 
•  Subject A: A medical history of chronic bronchitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cystic lung 
disease, and deep vein thrombosis died from left ventricular failure on Day 81 of the 
Maintenance Study in Study GS-US-418-3898. The cause of death was determined based upon 
the autopsy findings, which revealed coronary artery arteriosclerosis and left ventricular 
failure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 141/178 
 
 
 
•  Subject B: A medical history of asthma, ankylosing spondylitis, hypertension, and nasal 
polypectomy died from asthma on Day 302 of the Maintenance Study in Study GS-US-418-
3898. According to the investigator, the patient saw his primary care provider for asthma 
which was assessed to be flaring due to allergy. Death certificate showed asthma as cause of 
death. No autopsy was performed.  
•  Subject C: An history of chronic cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, 
and hepatic steatosis died due to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke on Day 343 in 
GS-US-418-3899. The subject was hospitalized for non-Q wave myocardial infarction on Study 
Day 337. During the course of hospitalization, he experienced an ischemic stroke and died on 
Study Day 343. Autopsy was performed which identified acute myocardial infarction as the 
primary cause of death. Additional post-mortem findings included aortic atherosclerosis, 
parietal thrombi in the apical area of the heart, and thromboembolism of the medial branch of 
cerebral artery, cerebral infarction, and cerebral oedema. The primary causes of death were 
determined to be myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.  
The MAH presented in the responses to the RSI two additional deaths: 
•  Subject D died from COVID-19 infection, two years after starting treatment with filgotinib 200 
mg. Although filgotinib does increase the risk for infections, firm conclusions on potential 
causality in this case with an ongoing pandemic cannot be determined.  
•  Subject E treated with open-label filgotinib 200 mg for approximately 1,5 years, who died from 
COVID-19 infection. Filgotinib had been discontinued around 1 month earlier due to 
endometrial cancer. Causality with filgotinib is less likely because treatment had been 
discontinued, although the exact timeframe is not clear. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of interest included all infections; serious infections; herpes zoster infections; 
opportunistic infections; malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]); NMSC; 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations; and thromboembolic events (including venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thrombosis, and cerebrovascular events).

Across the two placebo-controlled induction studies, the frequency of serious infections was 0.6% in 
the filgotinib 200 mg group, 1.1% in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 1.1% in the placebo group. In 
the placebo-controlled maintenance study, the frequency of serious infections in the filgotinib 200 mg 
group was 1%, compared to 0% in the respective placebo group. In the maintenance study filgotinib 
100 mg group, the frequency of serious infections was 1.7%, compared with 2.2% in the respective 
placebo group. 
The most common infections were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract 
infection. The most common serious infections were appendicitis, cellulitis and pneumonia (Table 56).

Adverse events were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 22.1. 
Adverse events of malignancy excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer were defined by the MedDRA Search Term List 
developed by Gilead. 
Model-based EAER ratio and corresponding 95% CI were estimated using a GEE model for longitudinal count data 
including treatment group adjusted for treatment period and patient population (biologic naive or biologic 
experienced) with an offset of natural log of exposure time. 
$ 
Data contributing to the zero-event count for only 1 treatment group were removed from the model-based 
analysis.

Adverse events were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 22.1. 
Adverse events of arterial thrombosis were defined by the embolic and thrombotic events, arterial Standardized 
MedDRA Queries. Model-based EAER ratio and corresponding 95% CI were estimated using a GEE model for 
longitudinal count data including treatment group adjusted for treatment period and patient population (biologic 
naive or biologic experienced) with an offset of natural log of exposure time. 
Cerebrovascular events 
Three events were reported in subjects in the filgotinib 200 mg group (EAER = 0.2/100 PYE), a 
Grade 2 brachiocephalic arteriosclerosis, a Grade 3 carotid artery stenosis, and a Grade 5 ischemic 
stroke; 2 events were reported in subjects in the filgotinib 100 mg group (EAER = 0.5/100 PYE), a 
Grade 4 spinal cord infarction and a Grade 2 transient ischemic attack; and 1 event was reported in 
subjects in the placebo group (EAER = 0.3/100 PYE), a Grade 4 cerebrovascular accident. The events

Safety in special populations 
Age 
The EAIRs for the AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study 
drug, AEs leading to death, and deaths in the induction phase are summarized by age (< 65 years and 
≥ 65 years).

Sex 
The risk for AEs and SAEs was numerically slightly higher for females than for males, but the difference 
is not considered to be clinically meaningful and a similar pattern was observed also for placebo. 
Race 
As the numbers of black or African American subjects by treatment group were low (filgotinib 200 mg 
[N = 6]; filgotinib 100 mg [N = 9]; placebo [N = 4]) and the numbers of subjects with race other by 
treatment group were also low (filgotinib 200 mg [N = 19]; filgotinib 100 mg [N = 19]; placebo 
[N = 17]), direct comparisons of safety results among the subgroups should be interpreted with 
caution. 
According to the MAH, during induction, the EAIRs for AEs and SAEs were generally similar between 
Asian and white subjects. There was no evidence to suggest an increased EAIR for AEs, Grade 3 or 
higher AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug for the filgotinib 200 mg 
and filgotinib 100 mg treatment groups compared with their respective placebo groups across the 
subgroups by race during maintenance. 
Prior and concomitant medication 
Prior TNF-α or vedolizumab failure 
During induction, the EAIRs for AEs and SAEs were numerically higher for the subgroup with prior 
TNF-α antagonist or vedolizumab failure compared with the subgroup without prior TNF-α antagonist or 
vedolizumab failure. There was no evidence to suggest an increased EAIR for AEs, Grade 3 or higher 
AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug for the filgotinib 200 mg and 
filgotinib 100 mg treatment groups compared with the placebo group for both subgroups by history of 
prior TNF-α antagonist or vedolizumab failure. 
Use of Systemic Corticosteroids or Immunomodulators at Baseline 
During induction, the EAIRs for AEs and SAEs were generally similar among the subgroups by use of 
systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at induction baseline.  
According to the MAH, there was no evidence to suggest an increased EAIR for AEs, Grade 3 or higher 
AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug for the filgotinib 200 mg and 
filgotinib 100 mg treatment groups compared with the placebo group across the subgroups by use of 
systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at induction baseline in Cohort 1. 
During maintenance, the EAIRs for AEs and SAEs were generally similar among the subgroups by use 
of systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at maintenance baseline.  
According to the MAH, there was no evidence to suggest an increased EAIR for AEs, Grade 3 or higher 
AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug for the filgotinib 200 mg and 
filgotinib 100 mg treatment groups compared with their respective placebo groups across the 
subgroups by use of systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators at maintenance baseline in 
Cohort 2. One death was reported among subjects with baseline use of systemic corticosteroids only 
and 1 death was reported among subjects with baseline use of immunomodulators only, both in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and lactation 
In clinical studies of filgotinib, male and female subjects of childbearing potential who engage in 
heterosexual intercourse must have agreed to use protocol-specified methods of contraception.

For Study GS-US-418-3898, as of 31 March 2020 (study end date), a total of 4 subject 
pregnancies were reported: 1 subject in the filgotinib 100 mg group during induction, and 
3 subjects (n = 1 filgotinib 100 mg, and n = 2 placebo following induction with filgotinib 
100 mg) during maintenance. One partner pregnancy was reported in Study GS-US-418-3898.  
For Study GS-US-418-3899, as of 28 February 2020 (interim data cut-off date), no subject 
pregnancies were reported. A total of 4 partner pregnancies were reported in 
Study GS-US-418-3899. 
A total of 2 filgotinib-exposed pregnancies and 5 partner pregnancies were reported from both studies. 
The outcome of these pregnancies in women exposed to filgotinib were: 
•  One elective termination without noted structural defects  
•  One ectopic pregnancy in the second subject, who underwent surgical termination via an 
urgent resection of right ovary and salpinx. 
The outcome of pregnancies of partners to male study subjects were: 
• 
Two healthy babies 
•  One baby with evidence of adverse effect  
•  One elective termination  
•  One unknown. 
Fertility 
No new information on the effects of filgotinib on fertility in nonclinical models was included in the 
submission.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
According to the MAH, no new findings relevant to the coadministration of filgotinib with other drugs 
were available. 
Post marketing experience 
According to the MAH, there have been no newly identified adverse reactions for filgotinib based on the 
post-marketing data available to date. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Filgotinib was approved for treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis in 2020 (EMEA/H/C/005113/0000). Important class effects of the JAK inhibitors include 
increased risk for infections (including herpes zoster), increased risk for venous thromboembolism, and 
concerns on an increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation, cardiovascular events and malignancy. 
JAK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, and filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy.  
For filgotinib specifically, there was concern that in animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired 
spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs were observed. This had 
not been observed for other JAK inhibitors. At the CHMP’s request at the time of the initial 
authorisation of the product, a stringent warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to mitigate 
the risk regarding male fertility. In addition, adequate risk minimisation measures had been 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 156/178 
 
 
 
implemented by the MAH. This risk is addressed in the educational material with the aim to limit the 
use of filgotinib to female patients and male patients without intent of fathering a child. Finally, the 
data from the ongoing clinical MANTA study [Study GS-US-418-4279] and MANTA-Ray [Study 
GLPG0634-CL-227] evaluating the impact on male fertility are expected to provide an understanding 
as to whether the findings are clinically relevant (see RMP sections). Interim data from these studies 
have recently been submitted and are being assessed by the CHMP in separate procedures (MEA007 
and 008).  
There were limited data in patients over 75 years of age and in patients with moderate renal 
impairment in the initial MAA. In the available data, an increased risk for serious AEs was observed for 
the 200 mg compared to the 100 mg dose. Therefore, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for 
RA patients aged 75 or above. A dose of 100 mg is also recommended in RA and UC patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment. 
In the current application, the safety analysis is based on 3 cohorts that pooled data from the pivotal 
phase 2b/3 study GS-US-418-3898 (cohort 1-induction study and cohort 2-maintenance study) and 
from the Phase 3 LTE Study GS-US-418-3899 (cohort 3-Long-term study).  
Exposure 
The mean treatment duration was 64.9 weeks for filgotinib 200 mg and 32.2 weeks for filgotinib 100 
mg. A total of 621 patients were treated with filgotinib 200 mg >1 year, and a total of 141 patients 
were treated with filgotinib 100 mg >1 year. Overall, a total of 1253 subjects with UC have received at 
least 1 dose of filgotinib for a total of 1567.4 PY. 
Adverse events 
During the induction phase (both biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients), the exposure-
adjusted incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher for filgotinib 200 
mg (391.0 E/100PYs) than for filgotinib 100 mg (352.4 E/100PYs) but highest for placebo (422.1 
E/100PYs). The EAIR of serious AEs and adverse events leading to discontinuation was lower for 
filgotinib 200 mg than for placebo.  
Also during the maintenance phase, the incidence rate of TEAEs was slightly higher for filgotinib 200 
mg  (167.4 E/100PYs) than for filgotinib 100 mg (147.2 E/100PYs) and placebo (140.2 E/100PYs), but 
it is reassuring that TEAEs was less frequent in both filgotinib groups than in patients starting on 
filgotinib and later re-randomised to placebo during the maintenance phase. No dose-relation was 
observed for serious adverse events or AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. 
In induction study, biologic-naïve patients from cohort A the occurrence of TEAEs in filgotinib 200 mg 
arm and placebo are numerically similar (42%, and 41.6%, respectively) whereas in cohort B 
(biologic-experienced), TEAEs were increased in placebo arm (70.4%) compared to filgotinib 200mg 
(64.5%). Furthermore, in filgotinib 200 mg arm, overall TEAEs are more frequently reported in 
biologic-experienced patients compared to biologic-naïve patients as well as the number of AEs grade 
3 or higher, serious AEs and TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation are also higher in cohort B 
than in cohort A. 
In the overall data (induction and maintenance phases of GS-US-418-3898 and long-term extension 
study GS-US-418-3899), there was no dose-relation observed for the overall occurrence of adverse 
events, serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. There were 5 deaths, all 
in the filgotinib 200 mg arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 157/178 
 
 
 
The most common adverse events were ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis, headache and upper 
respiratory tract infection. The incidence rates of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
urinary tract infection were all higher in the filgotinib groups than in the placebo group. 
There was one case of pulmonary embolism in the filgotinib 200 mg arm, and three cases of venous 
thrombosis in the placebo arm. Regarding arterial thrombosis, there were 3 cases reported in the 
filgotinib 200 mg arm (2 myocardial infarctions, 1 ischemic stroke), 1 case in the filgotinib 100 mg arm 
(1 TIA) and no cases in the placebo arm.  
Deaths 
There were 5 deaths, all in the filgotinib 200 mg arm.   
•  Subject A: No known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, who died on day 81 in the 
maintenance study. The autopsy showed severe arteriosclerosis and left ventricular failure. 
•  Subject B: Reported cause of death was asthma. Details on this case were requested by the 
CHMP, and it was confirmed that the patient had visited his general practitioner with clear 
signs of asthma.  
•  Subject C: No known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, who died from a myocardial 
infarction and ischemic stroke. The risk for arterial thrombosis is further discussed in the AESI 
section. 
•  Subject D: Died from COVID-19 infection, two years after starting treatment with filgotinib 200 
mg. Although filgotinib does increase the risk for infections, firm conclusions on potential 
causality in this case with an ongoing pandemic cannot be determined.  
•  Subject E: Treated with open-label filgotinib 200 mg for approximately 1,5 years, who died 
from COVID-19 infection. Filgotinib had been discontinued around 1 month earlier due to 
endometrial cancer. Causality with filgotinib is less likely because treatment had been 
discontinued, although the exact timeframe is not clear.  
In the recently presented pooled RA and UC data, the risk for death seems similar across all treatment 
groups (filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo). Although there are no clear indications that 
filgotinib confers an increased risk for MACE per se, there is a small numerical imbalance in 
cardiovascular death. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has updated the section 4.4 of the SmPC 
and included a warning that Jyseleca should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk 
factors.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of interest included all infections; serious infections; herpes zoster infections; 
opportunistic infections; malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]); NMSC; 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations; and thromboembolic events (including venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thrombosis, and cerebrovascular events). 
The incidence rate of infections was higher for the filgotinib 200 mg group (69.5 E/100PYs) than for 
the filgotinib 100 mg (58.5 E/100PYs) and placebo (61.0 E/100PYs) groups. For serious infections, 
there was no dose-relation observed. For herpes zoster, there was a clearly higher risk for the filgotinib 
200 mg group (22 cases, EAIR 1.8 E/100PYs) than for the filgotinib 100 mg and placebo groups (1 
case each, EAIR 0.3E/100PYs). According to the MAH, most events were non-serious and were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity. The risk for viral reactivation is included in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8.   
During the 10 week induction phase in the current study, the frequency of herpes zoster was 3/507 
patients (0.6%) in the filgotinib 200 mg group and 0 cases in the placebo group. At the CHMP’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 158/178 
 
 
 
request, the MAH presented comparative data from the filgotinib RA and UC studies, where the risk for 
herpes zoster in the UC program was generally consistent with the RA population.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of malignancies was higher for both filgotinib doses (a total of 15 
cases) than for placebo (0 cases). It is expected, however, that the treatment duration in the filgotinib 
arms are longer than for placebo. Of the 1161 patients included in the long-term extension study, a 
total of 871 were treated with filgotinib 200 mg; 157 with filgotinib 100 mg, and 133 with placebo. 
Since there is a latency for development of malignancies and the duration of treatment differs, 
comparison of the EAIRs must be made with caution. There was no specific pattern observed with 
regards to malignancies. As expected in the current patient population, there were cases of colon 
cancer/adenocarcinoma of the colon observed. The risk for malignancy will be further assessed through 
the GS-EU-418-5980 study, a non-interventional post-authorization safety study of filgotinib in the 
treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (category 3 in the RMP).  
In cohort 1, three cases of NMSC were experienced, out of them two cases of basal cell carcinoma. 
One in the placebo group of the cohort A. The event was considered related to study drug and was 
unresolved as of the end of study. The second case was with filgotinib 200 mg in the cohort B. The 
event was considered not related to study drug and resolved. In cohort 3, seven cases of basal cell 
carcinoma were reported in filgotinib 200 mg (0.8%, EAER= 0.6/100 PYE). Six events were not related 
to filgotinib. The seventh case a non-serious basal cell carcinoma was considered related to filgotinib.  
No GI perforation was reported.  
Regarding venous thromboembolism, there is a warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC because of a 
suspected class risk for the JAK inhibitors. In the UC studies, there was one case of pulmonary 
embolism in the filgotinib 200 mg arm, and three cases of venous thrombosis in the placebo arm. The 
CHMP considered that no update of the product information was warranted. However, a close 
monitoring of pulmonary embolism or clinical symptoms related to pulmonary embolism should be 
applied during the PSUR. 
Regarding arterial thrombosis, there was an increased risk for both doses of filgotinib although the 
actual number of cases were few (n=3 in the filgotinib 200 mg arm and n=1 in the filgotinib 100 mg 
arm). The CHMP considered that no update of the product information was warranted. 
In pooled data RA and UC data, the EAIR of MACE are numerically lower for filgotinib 200 mg (EAIR: 
0.5E/100PYs) than for filgotinib 100 mg (EAIR: 0.6E/100PYs) and placebo (EAIR: 0.8E/100PYs), which 
is reassuring. In these data, there are no clear indications on an increased risk for MACE with filgotinib 
200 mg. Although there are no clear indications that filgotinib confers an increased risk for MACE per 
se, there is a small numerical imbalance in cardiovascular death. See above warning on cardiovascular 
risk in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Laboratory findings 
During induction, there was a slight increase in haemoglobin values in both filgotinib arms, probably 
reflecting response to therapy. Haemoglobin values were stable during the maintenance phase. Platelet 
counts decreased in all arms during induction with the largest decrease observed for the filgotinib 
arms, probably reflecting response to therapy. Neutrophil values decreased in both filgotinib arms 
during induction and was relatively stable during the maintenance phase. The risk for neutropenia is 
already included in sections 4.2, 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Mean immunoglobulin values decreased in both filgotinib arms during induction and was relatively 
stable during maintenance. A slight increase was observed for the placebo arm. The risk for low 
immunoglobulin levels is not included in the SmPC. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH presented details 
on IgA, IgG and IgM levels over time in the different cohorts of the UC study. The proportion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 159/178 
 
 
 
patients with levels below lower limit of normal was small in all treatment groups and did not seem to 
be higher in the filgotinib 200 mg group than compared to the other treatment groups. The CHMP 
concluded that no SmPC update was needed. 
Regarding liver-related parameters, in cohort A (biologic-naive patients), only AST > 3× ULN was 
observed in filgotinib 200 mg arm (0.8%) and no increased ALT or Alkalin phosphatase. Conversely in 
cohort B (biologic-experienced patients), one subject (0.4%) in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group 
had ALT > 10 × ULN and 2 subjects (1.4%) in the placebo group had ALT > 5 × ULN.  
Also, in cohort 2, AST and ALT > 10 × ULN abnormalities were reported in 1 subject (0.5%) of filgotinib 
200 mg arm. No events were reported in the placebo group. ALT and ALT> 5 × ULN abnormalities were 
reported in 1 subject (0.5%) of filgotinib 200 mg. ALT and> 3 × ULN abnormalities were reported in 4 
subjects (2.0%) and 2 subjects (1.0%) in filgotinib 200 mg arm respectively.  
For grade 3 or 4 AST and ALT, the EAIRs in filgotinib 200 mg were 0.6/100 PYE and 1.5/100PYE in 
placebo. 
In the long-term study, median ALT values across the treatment groups were generally stable. One 
patient in the filgotinib 100 mg group had AST > 20 × ULN (and ALT > 10 × ULN) on study day 506. 
This patient had normal baseline values.  
CK and total cholesterol levels increased in both filgotinib arms, consistent with finding observed in the 
RA studies. LDL and HDL levels increased slightly, but the LDL/HDL ratios were generally unchanged. 
This is already adequately reflected in the SmPC. Serum creatinine increased in all treatment groups 
during induction but remained stable over the maintenance phase. 
As regards hypophosphatemia, EAIR was 17.8/100 PYE in filgotinib 200 mg arm and 10.3/100 PYE in 
placebo. Considering that confounding factors may also explained the events of hypophosphataemia, 
no firm conclusion can be drawn. The CHMP considered that no update of the product information was 
warranted. However, the MAH should pursue the monitoring of this laboratory abnormalities as part of 
the PSUR. 
Safety in special populations 
Age, sex and race 
During the induction phase, although the EAIR of TEAEs was higher for filgotinib 200 mg than for 
filgotinib 100 mg in patients aged 65 and above, it was not higher than for placebo and the risk for 
serious AEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation was not higher for the filgotinib 200 mg dose. During 
the maintenance phase, AEs were more frequent among patients aged >65 years in all treatment 
groups. There were 2 deaths during the maintenance phase, both in patients aged >65 years treated 
with filgotinib 200 mg. During induction, the IR of infections was lower among patients aged >65 years 
than among the younger patients. During maintenance, the risk for infections did not seem to be dose-
dependent among the elderly.  
For rheumatoid arthritis, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for patients aged 75 years and 
above, whereas no dose adjustment was proposed for elderly patients with ulcerative colitis. This is 
considered acceptable to the CHMP. However, since there are no data available in UC patients >75 
years, filgotinib is not recommended in patients aged 75 years and older. The SmPC section 4.2 has 
been updated accordingly. 
The risk for AEs ad SAEs was numerically slightly higher for females than for males, but the difference 
is not considered to be clinically meaningful and a similar pattern was observed also for placebo. 
There were no large differences in safety outcome between patients of different ethnicity.

Prior and concomitant medication 
The incidence rate of overall adverse events appears higher in cohort of biologic-experienced patients 
than in patient without TNF-α or vedolizumab failure, notably for the SOC “infections and infestations”, 
and this in both safety cohorts 1 and 2, and whatever filgotinib dosage. At the CHMP’s request, the 
MAH provided a detailed analysis on the incidence rates of adverse events in cohort of biologic 
experienced patients compared to patients without TNF-α or vedolizumab failure, and notably for the 
SOC “infections and infestations”, and whatever filgotinib dosage. Data show that in placebo arm this 
incidence rate is also high. Additionally, the MAH argued that the biologic-failure population typically 
represents patients with more severe disease activity and increased concomitant immunosuppressants 
use including systemic corticosteroids, all of which known as potential risk factors for infection. This 
CHMP considered that this could explain the observed difference between biologic-experienced patients 
and biologic-naïve patients. 
The SmPCs for Xeljanz and Olumiant include information on the increased risk for herpes zoster in 
patients who are bDMARD-experienced. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH presented data on the EAIR of 
herpes zoster in the respective treatment groups. In the data presented, there was a notable 
difference between biologic-naïve (7 cases, EAIR: 1.2E/100PYs) and biologic-experienced patients (15 
cases, EAIR: 2.2E/100PYs), although it was agreed that the number of cases of herpes zoster in each 
group were quite few. The MAH argues that there is potential impact of concomitant medication; 
however it is noted that concomitant medication was given in a similar proportion of cases in both 
groups (3/8 patients in the biologic-naïve group and 7/16 patients in the biologic-experienced group) 
and thus there are no large differences between the groups. To further corroborate this issue, the MAH 
was asked to present data on the EAIR of herpes zoster in the respective treatment groups (bDMARD-
naïve and bDMARD-experienced) in pooled data from the RA and UC studies. Based on these data, the 
CHMP considered that no SmPC updated were needed with regards to bDMARD-naïve and bDMARD-
experienced patients. Considering that there seems to be a dose-dependent risk for herpes zoster, this 
issue is further pursued within the ongoing variation EMEA/H/C/005113/II/0008. 
There was no evidence to suggest an increased EAIR for AEs for the filgotinib groups compared with 
the placebo group across the subgroups of patients with concomitant corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressants. 
Pregnancy, lactation and male fertility 
There was one case of elective termination in a pregnancy with a filgotinib-exposed father. Filgotinib is 
currently contraindicated during pregnancy and there’s a warning about the potential risk of reduced 
fertility or infertility in male in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. There’s also adequate information in Section 
4.6 of the SmPC. As indicated above, the data from the ongoing clinical MANTA study [Study GS-US-
418-4279] and MANTA-Ray [Study GLPG0634-CL-227] evaluating the impact on male fertility are 
being assessed by the CHMP in separate procedures (MEA 007 and MEA008).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The most common adverse events were ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis, headache and upper 
respiratory tract infection. The incidence rates of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
urinary tract infection were all higher in the filgotinib groups than in the placebo group. 
In the original UC application, there were 3 deaths reported in the UC clinical studies, all occurring in 
the filgotinib 200 mg group (2 cardiovascular, 1 asthma. EAIR of death=0.2E/100PYs). Two additional 
deaths in the filgotinib 200 mg group were reported in response to day 120 LoQ (COVID-19). The MAH 
presented pooled RA and UC data in which the risk for death seems similar across all treatment groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 161/178 
 
 
 
(filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo). Although there are no clear indications that 
filgotinib confers an increased risk for MACE per se, there is a small numerical imbalance in 
cardiovascular death. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has updated the section 4.4 of the SmPC 
with this information and included a warning that Jyseleca should be used with caution in patients at 
high cardiovascular risk. 
In the overall safety dataset, there were 10 cases of malignancies (EAIR 0.8 E/100PYs) reported in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group, 5 cases (EAIR 1.3 E/100PYs), and no cases reported in the placebo group. The 
risk for malignancy will be further assessed through the GS-EU-418-5980 study, a non-interventional 
post authorization safety study of filgotinib in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (category 3 in the RMP). 
Since there are no data are available in UC patients >75 years, filgotinib is not recommended in 
patients aged 75 years and older. The SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the safety profile in the ulcerative colitis indication is consistent with 
the observed safety profile in the RA population and that the data provided supported the new 
indication in UC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

Section 4.3 of the SmPC contraindicates 
filgotinib in active TB and active serious 
infections. 
Recommendation in SmPC Section 4.2 to 
avoid initiation or interrupt treatment in 
patients with a serious infection, an 
absolute lymphocyte count 
<0.5 x 109 cells/L or an absolute 
neutrophil count <1.0 x 109 cells/L. 
Recommendation in SmPC Section 4.4 on 
the management of infections in patients 
receiving filgotinib, and advice on 
patients at increased risk of infection. 
Recommendation in SmPC Section 4.4 to 
screen for tuberculosis (TB) and to 
initiate antimycobacterial therapy in 
patients with latent TB before 
administering filgotinib, and not to 
administer filgotinib to patients with 
active TB. The warning also recommends 
that patients are monitored for signs and 
symptoms of TB, including patients who 
tested negative for latent TB prior to 
initiating treatment. Section 4.4 also 
provides advice on the management of 
viral reactivation, including Herpes zoster 
and viral hepatitis. 
Recommendation in SmPC section 4.8 
that a starting dose of 100 mg is 
administered to RA patients aged 75 
years and older as there was a higher 
incidence of serious infections in this age 
group, although data are limited. 
Filgotinib is not recommended in patients 
with UC aged 75 years and older, as 
there is no data in this population.

significant changes to the text or layout. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, idiopathic inflammatory disease that affects the colon, most 
commonly afflicting adults aged 30 to 40 years and resulting in disability. It is characterized by 
relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation, starting in the rectum and extending to proximal 
segments of the colon. Although the incidence is stabilizing in Western countries, burden remains high, 
as prevalence exceeds 0.3%. The pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial and comprises immune, genetic, 
environmental, and microbial components. Hallmark symptoms of UC are bloody diarrhoea, rectal 
urgency, and tenesmus. The clinical course usually involves periods of remission interspersed with 
periods of active disease. Ulcerative colitis may also be associated with extraintestinal manifestations, 
including ocular lesions, skin lesions, arthritis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, UC 
carries an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment paradigm for UC has historically comprised an initial treatment for acute disease, with 
the goal of inducing a state of clinical remission, followed by a therapeutic intervention to maintain 
remission. Generally, patients presenting with mild to moderate disease activity are initially 
administered an anti-inflammatory agent such as a 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) derivative, with or 
without concurrent corticosteroids. Patients who fail to respond to initial therapy or who present with 
moderate to severe disease activity require treatment with more effective agents such as 
immunomodulators and biologic therapy. For nearly 2 decades, biological therapies were dominated by 
anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents but have recently included anti-integrin and anti–
interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 antibodies. Although biological therapies have led to substantial 
improvements in the care of patients with UC and have become an integral part of standard therapy, 
not all treated patients benefit from these therapies. As pointed out by the MAH, approximately one-
third of patients do not respond after initiation of biological therapy (primary nonresponse) and among 
patients who initially respond to treatment with biologics, 30% to 50% eventually stop responding 
(secondary nonresponse). The clinical need for new therapies has led to the development of orally 
bioavailable small-molecule inhibitors that target signal transduction pathways involved in the 
pathogenesis of UC, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Currently, there is only one JAK inhibitor 
approved for the treatment of UC (tofacitinib). There is an unmet medical need in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application for approval of Jyseleca “for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were 
intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent” is supported by data from one phase 2b/3 
study, GS-US-418-3898 (SELECTION), which is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-
center study that consists of two induction studies (Cohort A induction study and Cohort B induction 
study) and one randomised withdrawal maintenance study. In addition, supportive data from the 
ongoing Long-Term Extension Study GS-US-418 -3899 have been submitted.  
Subjects in the study were adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic 
Score 6 to 12; endoscopy subscore ≥ 2; rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1; stool frequency subscore ≥ 1; 
and Physician’s Global Assessment subscore ≥ 2). Patients were permitted to use stable doses of 
concomitant therapies for ulcerative colitis, including oral aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids, and 
immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate). In the Cohort A study, patients had to 
previously demonstrated an inadequate clinical response, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least 
one of the following agents: corticosteroids, oral azathioprine, 6-MP or MTX. In Cohort B study, patient 
had to previously demonstrated an inadequate clinical response, loss of response to, or intolerance to 
at least one TNF-α antagonist or vedolizumab. 
In Cohort A induction study (Biologic naïve subjects) 660 subjects were randomized (245 patients 
received 200mg filgotinib, 278 patients received 100mg filgotinib and 137 patients received placebo). 
Overall, 618 subjects (93.8%) completed the cohort A introduction study. The main reasons for study 
drug discontinuation were subject decision and AEs, with a similar distribution between randomized 
groups. 
In Cohort B induction study (biologic experienced subjects) 950 subjects were screened and 691 
subjects were randomized (262 patients received 200mg filgotinib, 286 patients received 100mg 
filgotinib and 143 patients received placebo). Overall, 623 subjects (90.4%) completed the cohort B 
introduction study. The main reasons for study drug discontinuation were AEs and subject decisions, 
with a similar distribution between randomized groups.

Page 170/178 
 
 
 
Subjects who completed the induction studies and achieved either endoscopy/bleeding/stool frequency 
(EBS) remission or Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) response at Week 10 were rerandomized into the 
Maintenance Study (Week 11 to Week 58). Of the 1241 subjects who completed the induction 
studies, 664 subjects continued to the maintenance study. The 571 subjects treated with filgotinib in 
the induction phase were rerandomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on the assigned filgotinib 
regimen or switch to placebo. The 93 subjects who were treated with placebo in the induction phase 
continued with placebo treatment also during the maintenance phase. A total of 401 patients (60.4%) 
completed the maintenance phase, numerically more in the filgotinib/filgotinib 200 mg group 
(150/202, 74.3%) than in the filgotinib/filgotinib 100 mg group (104/179, 58.1%) and the placebo 
groups (filgotinib 200mg/placebo 41/99, 41.4%, filgotinib 100mg/placebo 42/91, 46.2% and 
placebo/placebo group 64/93, 68.8%. The main reason for discontinuation were disease worsening.  
The study uses Endoscopic/Blood/Stool (EBS) remission as primary outcome, a combined endpoint 
derived from the Mayo clinical score, excluding the PGA. To reach EBS remission, the patient requires 
to have achieved an endoscopic response (a subscore of 0-1), cessation of rectal bleeding (subscore 0) 
and at least a 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1. 
Although not fully consistent with the recommendations of the EMA guideline (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 
Rev.1 Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis) 
it is acceptable since it requires efficacy both in clinical and endoscopic outcomes.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the biologic naïve patients (Cohort A study), the primary endpoint, EBS remission at week 10, was 
achieved by 26.1% in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 19.1% in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 15.3% in 
the placebo group. Only the higher dose, filgotinib 200mg, was statistical significantly better than 
placebo (difference in proportions were 10.8% (95% CI: 2.1% to 19.5%, p = 0.0157)). The results 
from all the key secondary endpoints were in line with the results from the primary endpoint. It is 
noted that although only 12.2% achieved endoscopic remission (i.e. mayo endoscopic score 0), 33.9% 
achieved endoscopic response (score 0-1) an outcome that often are defined as mucosal healing 
(exploratory endpoint). In the placebo group the proportion were 3.6% for endoscopic remission and 
20.4% for endoscopic response. Histologic remission was seen in 35% of patients in filgotinib 200mg 
group and 16% in the placebo group.  
The proportions of patients achieving a MCS response at week 10 were 66.5% (163/245) in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group, 59.2% (164/277) in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 46.7% (64/137) in the 
placebo group and these patient were allowed to proceed into the maintenance study.  
In the biologic experienced patients (Cohort B study), EBS remission at week 10 was achieved by 
11.5% in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 9.5% in the filgotinib 100 mg group and 4.2% in the placebo 
group. Also, in this cohort, only the higher dose, filgotinib 200mg, was statistical significantly better 
than placebo (difference in proportion was 7.2% (CI 1.6% to 12.8%, p=0.013). None of the key 
secondary endpoints were statistically significant in this patient group, although it is noted that for 
histologic remission there was a numerically increase in favour for filgotinib 200 mg 19.8% vs 8.5% 
(difference 11.4% CI 4.2%, 18.6%). Only 3.4% and 17.2% of patients achieved endoscopic remission 
and endoscopic response. However, this patient group consisted of patients with a more severe 
disease, resistant to biologic therapies (50% of the patients had received both a TNF-inhibitor and 
vedolizumab) and more than half of the patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group (53.1%) achieved MCS 
response at week 10. In the filgotinib 100 mg and placebo group, 35.8% respectively 17.6% achieved 
MCS response at week 10. These patients were allowed to proceed to the maintenance study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 171/178 
 
 
 
In the maintenance study, statistically significant treatment differences between filgotinib 200 mg and 
placebo at Week 58 were observed for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. The primary 
endpoint, EBS remission at week 58, was reached by 37.2% of the Filgotinib 200 mg group and 11.2% 
of the placebo group. Difference in proportion was 26.0% (95% CI 16.0% to 35.9%, p< 0.0001). The 
proportions of subjects who achieved 6-month corticosteroid-free EBS remission at Week 58 were 
27.2% in the 200 mg group respective 6.4 % in the placebo group (difference in proportion 20.8% CI 
7.7% to 33.9%). Treatment differences between filgotinib 100mg and respective placebo group were 
statistically significant for the primary endpoint (Filgotinib 100 mg: 23.8%, respective placebo: 13.5%; 
difference in proportions: 10.4%, 95% CI: −0.0% to 20.7%, p = 0.0420), but not for any of the key 
secondary endpoints at Week 58. In addition, 29.6% of the patients in the 100mg group discontinued 
the medication because of disease worsening. 
In the 200 mg treated group, the proportion of bio-experienced patients achieving EBS remission at 
week 58 was 22/92 (23.9%) and the proportion of bio-naïve patients was 52/107 (48.6%). 
These results are considered clinically relevant in the indication claimed by the MAH and supports the 
use of 200 mg QD dosing regimen. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary endpoint, EBS remission, is a composite score. Ideally, co-primary endpoints on both 
symptomatic remission and endoscopic healing would have been utilised in line with the 
CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 rev 1 guideline. It is however noted that the chosen definition of remission did 
refer to all subscores of the Mayo score, excluding the physician global assessment subscore which is 
not of primary interest. So, it did encompass both symptomatic and endoscopic evaluation, and 
included assessment of cessation of rectal bleeding as requested by the guideline. As such the 
definition is acceptable. However, upon request, the MAH provided additional analysis exploring the 
components of the EBS remission endpoint separately. This analyse confirmed that in the overall 
population a beneficial effect was achieved in both the endoscopic and the symptomatic part of the 
EBS-score, both at week 10 and week 58.  
There were some uncertainties regarding the clinical benefit for filgotinib in the bio-experienced patient 
group. Regarding induction of remission, the magnitude of difference in the primary endpoint, EBS 
remission, was small and filgotinib failed to reach statistical significance for all secondary endpoints in 
this cohort. In particular, there was a concern that the endpoint considered to be predictive for the 
long-term outcome/prognosis of the patients (endoscopic improvement/remission) was not achieved at 
a relevantly higher rate with filgotinib as compared to placebo. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH 
provided additional information on this issue. When clinical and endoscopic response were analysed 
separately, a numerically better response could be seen also in the endoscopic part of the EBS-score 
and the additional information provided by the MAH regarding mucosal healing (defined as endoscopic 
respons in combination with histological remission), showing that a numerically greater proportion of 
biologic-experienced subjects achieved mucosal healing in the filgotinib 200 mg group compared with 
the placebo group at Week 58, added further evidence that a beneficial effect is seen also on the 
mucosa. In addition, the results achieved in the key secondary endpoints in the maintenance phase 
points towards a beneficial effect also regarding sustained efficacy and corticosteroid-free EBS-
remission, although it is acknowledged that only a few patients achieved a complete healing of the 
mucosa.    
Although statistically significant different from placebo, the proportion of subjects who achieved 
sustained EBS remission at Week 58 were low, only 18.1%. However, additional analysis provided 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 172/178 
 
 
 
upon request showed that >60% of the patient in EBS-remission at week 10 were still in EBS 
remission at week 58. 
Overall, there are support from secondary endpoints measuring different aspects of the disease. 
In addition, since the study did not evaluate the effect of a higher induction dose followed by a lower 
maintenance dose, the MAH has agreed at the CHMP’s request to conduct a study exploring a reduction 
of maintenance dose in a post-marketing setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Important class effects of the JAK inhibitors include increased risk for infections (including herpes 
zoster), increased risk for venous thromboembolism, and concerns on an increased risk for 
gastrointestinal perforation, cardiovascular events and malignancy. JAK inhibitors are known to be 
teratogenic, and filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy.  
For filgotinib specifically, there is concern that in animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired 
spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs were observed. Therefore, 
the use of filgotinib should be restricted to female patients and male patients without intent of 
fathering a child. Two clinical studies (the MANTA studies) are currently ongoing aiming to further 
elucidate this issue. Interim data from these studies up to Week 26 are currently being assessed by 
the CHMP as part of separate procedures. 
During the 11 week induction phase (both biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients) of study 
GS-US-418-3898, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) was 391.0 E/100PYs for filgotinib 200 mg, 352.4 E/100PYs for filgotinib 100 mg and 422.1 
E/100PYs for placebo. The EAIR of serious infections was 20.6 E/100PYs for filgotinib 200 mg, 23.8 
E/100PYs for filgotinib 100 mg and 22.4 E/100PYs for placebo. There were no deaths in either 
treatment group.  
Also, during the maintenance phase, the incidence rate of TEAEs was slightly higher for filgotinib 200 
mg (167.4 E/100PYs) than for filgotinib 100 mg (147.2 E/100PYs) and placebo (140.2 E/100PYs). No 
dose-relation was observed for serious adverse events or AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. 
The most common adverse events were ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis, headache and upper 
respiratory tract infection. The incidence rates of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
urinary tract infection were all higher in the filgotinib groups than in the placebo group. 
Adverse events of interest included all infections; serious infections; herpes zoster infections; 
opportunistic infections; malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]); NMSC; 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations; and thromboembolic events (including venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thrombosis, and cerebrovascular events). 
The incidence rate of infections was 69.5 E/100PYs in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 58.5 E/100PYs in 
the filgotinib 100 mg group and 61.0 E/100PYs in the placebo group. For serious infections, there was 
no dose-relation observed. For herpes zoster, there were 22 cases (EAIR 1.8 E/100PYs) in the filgotinib 
200 mg group and 1 case each (EAIR 0.3E/100PYs) in the filgotinib 100 mg and placebo groups. 
Among laboratory parameters, during induction, there was a slight increase in haemoglobin values in 
both filgotinib arms. Haemoglobin values were stable during the maintenance phase. Platelet counts 
decreased in all arms during induction with the largest decrease observed for the filgotinib arms. 
Neutrophil values decreased in both filgotinib arms during induction and was relatively stable during 
the maintenance phase. Mean immunoglobulin values decreased in both filgotinib arms during 
induction and was relatively stable during maintenance. A small increase in ALT levels was observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 173/178 
 
 
 
all treatment groups during induction, but values were relatively stable during maintenance. Increases 
in AST levels was more prominent in the filgotinib groups. CK and total cholesterol levels increased in 
both filgotinib arms. The CHMP considered that this information was already adequately addressed in 
the SmPC and that no updates were warrented. 
AEs were more frequent among patients aged >65 years in all treatment groups. For rheumatoid 
arthritis, a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for patients aged 75 years and above, whereas no 
dose adjustment was proposed for elderly patients with ulcerative colitis. This is considered acceptable 
to the CHMP. However, since there are no data are available in UC patients >75 years, filgotinib is not 
recommended in patients aged 75 years and older. The SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important uncertainties pertain to adverse events of low frequency and long latency, for example 
cardiovascular disease and malignancy.  
At the approval of filgotinib for treatment of patients with RA there was concern on the risk for 
impaired male fertility based on preclinical findings. Two clinical studies (the MANTA studies) are 
currently ongoing aiming to further elucidate this issue. Interim data from these studies up to Week 26 
has recently been submitted within MEA 007 and MEA 008. The results will be thoroughly assessed 
within the MEA procedures, and the issue is not further pursued within this variation.  
In the original UC application, there were 3 deaths reported in the UC clinical studies, all occurring in 
the filgotinib 200 mg group (2 cardiovascular, 1 asthma. EAIR of death=0.2E/100PYs). Two additional 
deaths in the filgotinib 200 mg group were reported in response to day 120 LoQ (COVID-19).  The 
MAH presented pooled RA and UC data in which the risk for death seems similar across all treatment 
groups (filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo). Although there are no clear indications that 
filgotinib confers an increased risk for MACE per se, there is a small numerical imbalance in 
cardiovascular death. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has updated the section 4.4 of the SmPC 
with this information and included a warning that Jyseleca should be used with caution in patients at 
high cardiovascular risk. 
There was one case of pulmonary embolism in the filgotinib 200 mg arm, and three cases of venous 
thrombosis in the placebo arm. Regarding arterial thrombosis, there were 3 cases reported in the 
filgotinib 200 mg arm (2 myocardial infarctions, 1 ischemic stroke), 1 case in the filgotinib 100 mg arm 
(1 TIA) and no cases in the placebo arm. The CHMP considered that no update of the existing warning 
in Section 4.4 was warranted. However, a close monitoring of pulmonary embolism or clinical 
symptoms related to pulmonary embolism should be applied during the PSUR. 
In the overall safety dataset, there were 10 cases of malignancies (EAIR 0.8 E/100PYs) reported in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group, 5 cases (EAIR 1.3 E/100PYs), and no cases reported in the placebo group. The 
risk for malignancy will be further assessed through the GS-EU-418-5980 study, a non-interventional 
post authorization safety study of filgotinib in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (category 3 in the RMP). 
In induction study, biologic-naïve patients from cohort A the occurrence of TEAEs in filgotinib 200 mg 
arm and placebo are numerically similar (42%, and 41.6%, respectively) whereas in cohort B 
(biologic-experienced), TEAEs were increased in placebo arm (70.4%) compared to filgotinib 200mg 
(64.5%). Furthermore, in filgotinib 200 mg arm, overall TEAEs are more frequently reported in 
biologic-experienced patients compared to biologic-naïve patients as well as the number of AEs grade 
3 or higher, serious AEs and TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation are also higher in cohort B 
than in cohort A. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided a detailed analysis on the incidence rates of 
Assessment report  
EMA/553754/2021  
Page 174/178 
 
 
 
adverse events in cohort of biologic experienced patients compared to patients without TNF-α or 
vedolizumab failure, and notably for the SOC “infections and infestations”, irrespective of filgotinib 
dosage. Data show that in placebo arm this incidence rate is also high. Additionally, the MAH argued 
that the biologic-failure population typically represents patients with more severe disease activity and 
increased concomitant immunosuppressants use including systemic corticosteroids, all of which known 
as potential risk factors for infection. Thus CHMP considered that this could explain the observed 
difference between biologic-experienced patients and biologic-naïve patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant effect as measured by EBS remission has been 
demonstrated for Jyseleca 200 mg, both as induction and maintenance treatment, in the population of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
For patients with previous biological therapy, the treatment effect was modest, and none of the 
secondary endpoints in the induction phase reached statistically significance. It is acknowledged that 
this patient group consisted of patients with a more severe disease, resistant to biologic therapies, and 
although the clinical relevance of the modest efficacy seen in this patient group was questioned, 
especially regarding the endpoints considered to be predictive for the long-term outcome/prognosis of 
the patients (i.e. endoscopic improvement/remission), the MAH provided additional analysis on 
sustained long term efficacy, corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing (endoscopic 
response/histologic remission) confirms a beneficial effect also in this subpopulation.  
The data submitted supports the proposed posology of 200 mg once daily for induction and 
maintenance therapy.  
Overall, there are support from secondary endpoints measuring different aspects of the disease. 
From a safety perspective, the safety profile seems overall consistent with the safety profile observed 
in the RA indication. Important class effects of the JAK inhibitors include increased risk for infections 
(including herpes zoster), increased risk for venous thromboembolism, and concerns on an increased 
risk for gastrointestinal perforation, cardiovascular events and malignancy. JAK inhibitors are known to 
be teratogenic, and filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. For filgotinib specifically, there is 
concern that in animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological 
effects on male reproductive organs were observed. Therefore, the use of filgotinib should be restricted 
to female patients and male patients without intent of fathering a child. Two clinical studies (the 
MANTA studies) are currently ongoing aiming to further elucidate this issue. Interim data from these 
studies up to Week 26 are currently being assessed by the CHMP as part of separate procedures. 
At the approval of the RA indication, there was concern that the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of 
death was higher for filgotinib 200 mg than for the comparator adalimumab, although the actual 
numbers were small. The relevance of this observation was considered difficult to assess taken into 
account that overall the differences between the groups were small with overlapping 95% CIs. 
Furthermore, there were no dose-dependency observed for the most important AESIs of serious 
infections, MACE or malignancy. Also in the UC population, there is a numerically higher incidence of 
death in the filgotinib 200 mg group than in the filgotinib 100 mg and placebo groups but again, the 
total number of cases are few. In the pooled data presented during this procedure, the risk for death 
seems similar across all treatment groups (filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and placebo). Although 
there are no clear indications that filgotinib confers an increased risk for MACE per se, there is a small 
numerical imbalance in cardiovascular death. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has strengthen 
the warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC to further minimise the risk in patients at high risk for 
cardiovascular disease. 
In the overall safety dataset, there were 10 cases of malignancies (EAIR 0.8 E/100PYs) reported in the 
filgotinib 200 mg group, 5 cases (EAIR 1.3 E/100PYs), and no cases reported in the placebo group. The 
risk for malignancy will be further assessed through the GS-EU-418-5980 study, a non interventional

post authorization safety study of filgotinib in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (category 3 in the RMP). 
Since there are no data are available in UC patients >75 years, filgotinib is not recommended in 
patients aged 75 years and older.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP considered that the suggested indication text “Jyseleca is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent” 
adequately reflects the intended population. 
The study did not evaluate the effect of a higher induction dose followed by a lower maintenance dose. 
Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH accepted to conduct a study exploring a reduction of 
maintenance dose in a post-marketing setting. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jyseleca in the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to 
either conventional therapy or a biologic agent is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the treatment of active ulcerative colitis in adults patients for 
Jyseleca. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC and the Package 
Leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP is updated to Version 4.0. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to do minor updates to the Annex II and to implement 
minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the

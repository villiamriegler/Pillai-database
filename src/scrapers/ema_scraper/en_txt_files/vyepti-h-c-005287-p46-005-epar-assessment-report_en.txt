1.  Introduction 
On 29 March 2023, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for Vyepti in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH states that trial 18922A is conducted as part of a global development programme for 
eptinezumab in paediatric patients with migraine as per the Paediatric Investigation Plan agreed with 
the EMA, UK MHRA, and the initial Paediatric Study Plan agreed with the US FDA, as well as to fulfil US 
FDA PMR 3796-2. The paediatric eptinezumab migraine programme agreed with the EMA/PDCO 
includes the following trials: 
•  1 PK trial in children (6 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) (Trial 18922A; where the 
Main Study Period is completed and the Extension Period is ongoing) 
•  2 efficacy and safety trials: 
- 19356A: trial in adolescents with chronic migraine (ongoing) 
- 19357A: trial in children and adolescents with episodic migraine (planned) 
•  All participants who complete the 2 efficacy and safety trials are offered participation in a long-
term extension trial (Trial 19379A; ongoing) 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The strength, formulation, and mode of administration of eptinezumab used in Trial 18922A are 
presented in Panel 1 
For participants assigned to eptinezumab 300 mg (the content of 3 vials), a 100 mL bag of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection was used to prepare the solution for infusion. 
For participants assigned to eptinezumab 150 mg (the content of 1.5 vials), a 100 mL bag of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection was used to prepare the solution for infusion. 
No participants weighed less than 20 kg and thus no participants received eptinezumab 100 mg. 
The pharmaceutical formulation of eptinezumab is an IV solution for infusion. The formulation is the 
same as that approved for use in adults.

3.  Clinical Pharmacology 
3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
3.1.1.  Introduction 
Within this Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 submission, the MAH provided a population PK 
analysis (Population Pharmacokinetic Report, dated 31 January 2023) of eptinezumab in paediatrics 
aged 6 to < 18 years using data from Study 18922A (Part A). The objective of this population PK 
analysis was to (i) characterise the PK of eptinezumab in paediatrics aged 6 to < 18 years, (ii) 
investigate the impact of body weight and age, and (iii) compare the PK between paediatrics and 
adults. This study was listed in the respective PIP EMEA-002243-PIP01-17(-M02). 
The paediatric dosing was aimed to match eptinezumab exposure levels achieved in adults receiving 
300 mg eptinezumab intravenously (IV). In Study 18922A the following doses were administered in 
Part A: 
≤ 20 kg: 
100 mg IV  
>20 kg to ≤ 40 kg:  150 mg IV 
>40 kg: 
200 mg IV 
Note: one child was inadvertently infused with 200 mg instead of 150 mg. It was included in the PK 
analysis. 
3.1.2.  Methods 
3.1.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
In study 18922A, PK samples were drawn at immediately after end of infusion (+ 5 min) and 2 h (+/- 
5 min) after end of infusion on Day 1 and then at end of Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 20. 
The PK eptinezumab was analysed by noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. 
PK analysis was conducted using the nonlinear mixed-effects approach with NONMEM software,  
Version 7.  
A previously developed population PK model for adults (n=2123), where data from eight clinical 
studies were used, served as a basis for the paediatric population PK model. The starting point was a 
2-compartment model with zero order infusion, linear elimination and exponential interindividual 
variability (IIV) on clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartment 
(Vc and Vp, respectively), and inter-compartmental clearance (Q). A combined (proportional and 
additive) residual error model was used. Some previously identified covariates from the adult 
population were retained in the model and fixed to their prior adult estimates, i.e., creatine clearance 
capped at 150 ml/min (CLcr_cap), disease (DS; healthy, chronic migraine [CM] or episodic migraine 
[EM] patients) and baseline monthly migraine days (MMD) on CL, and disease on Vc. The impact of 
body weight, age and sex were then re-investigated as covariates in the paediatric population. 
Area under the concentration-time curve from zero to week 12 (AUC0-w.12) and maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) were calculated as secondary PK parameters from the individual estimates. 
In order to compare the PK between paediatrics and adults, the paediatric population PK model was 
used to simulate different dosing scenarios. A virtual population of 13300 paediatrics was generated 
using the body weight distribution for boys and girls provided by Centers for Disease Control and 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Prevention. The ratio between the geometric means for each paediatric subgroup and the adult 
population was calculated as an assessment of the similarity to the adult population. If these ratios 
were within 60 % and 140 % in each paediatric subgroup, similarity between adults and paediatrics 
was claimed. 
3.1.2.2.  Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
Model selection was done based on objective function values (OFV), plausibility and precision of 
parameter estimates, and graphical evaluation of goodness-of-fit (GOF). The predictive performance 
was investigated using visual predictive checks (VPCs). A Bootstrap analysis was done using 400 
dataset replicates. 
3.1.3.  Results 
Among the 28 paediatric patients included in the population PK analysis, 12 (43 %) were aged 6 to < 
12 years and 16 (57 %) aged 12 to < 18 years. Mean body weight was 51.1 kg (min = 20 kg, max = 
80 kg), where 11 paediatrics (39 %) had a body weight between 20 and 40 kg and 17 (61 %) a body 
weight of more than 40 kg. Overall, 20 (71 %) patients were female and 8 were male (29 %). In total, 
160 plasma concentrations were available for analysis. In total, 17 patients received 300 mg and 11 
150 mg. None received 100 mg. 
The final population PK model in paediatrics, is a 2-compartment model with zero order absorption and 
first-order elimination. IIV is implemented on CL, Q, Vc, and Vp. Body weight was set as covariate on 
CL and Q (exponent 0.75), as well as on Vc and Vp (exponent 1). A population typical body weight of 
70 kg was used for allometric scaling. Parameter estimates of the final paediatric population PK model 
are listed in Table . GOF plots and a VPC are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Creatine 
clearance capped at 150 ml/min (CLcr_cap), disease (healthy, CM or EM patients) and baseline 
monthly migraine days as covariates on CL and disease on Vc were retained from the adult model 
using their fixed values. These values are not listed in the final parameter estimates of the paediatric 
modelling approach. 
The secondary PK parameters were calculated at: median half-life (t½) 28.4 days (SD=5.3 days), 
AUC0-W12 = 6.6*104 μg*h/mL (SD=2.1*104), and Cmax = 125 μg/mL (SD=38).

3.1.4.  CHMP comment on PK modelling 
Population PK model 
No information regarding the quantification limit could be found in the population PK report. These 
should be provided along with the modelling exercises (LLOQ, BLQ). 
A paediatric population PK model was developed based on prior knowledge in adults. By doing so, the 
MAH explained that previously identified covariates from the adult model were used for the paediatric 
model and fixed to their prior estimates (i.e., creatine clearance capped at 150 ml/min (CLcr_cap), 
disease (DS; healthy, chronic migraine [CM] or episodic migraine [EM] patients) and baseline monthly 
migraine days (MMD) on CL, and disease on Vc), except for allometric scaling exponents. These 
covariate parameters were not clearly listed and explained in the presented results for the paediatric 
model. Thus, their values and impact on the paediatric model are not clear. In addition, the use of fix 
covariates derived from the adult model is not deemed plausible. Firstly, what is the rationale of using 
creatine clearance capped at 150 ml/min in the paediatric model? Secondly, there were no healthy 
children in the dataset and it is not clear how many patients were EM or CM, or if these diseases 
differences can be reliably estimated considering that the data are very limited. In addition, these adult 
covariates may be correlated with weight related covariates on CL and V, that have been estimated for 
the adult population. However, in contrast 0.75 and 1 have been set for allometric scaling for the 
paediatric model, which is endorsed from the methodological point of use. And thirdly, is it plausible to 
assume the same MMD for the paediatric population? Overall, this strategy is currently questioned. 
Moreover, from the provided report it is not clear what exactly happened when age (and sex) was 
tested as covariate. So it is not entirely clear if or to which extent an age effect may be observed. 
Since the majority of the population (and the main target population) is female, an effect of sex may 
not be detected, even if existing. However, results could have been provided for that as well. 
The MAH claims similarity of exposure if ratios between paediatrics and adults fulfil a 60 to 140 % 
criterion. This criterion appears arbitrarily chosen and deemed not acceptable given that the higher 
300 mg adult fix dose is used for the exposure bridging approach (see below). In general, this range is 
considered too wide to use. Moreover, it should be considered that in adults the 100 mg dose, despite 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/399588/2023

slightly lower efficacy, was chosen as standard dose due to better safety (lower rate of hypersensitivity 
reactions). The bootstrap analysis included zero as lower boundary for the two parameters Q and Vp 
possibly indicating problems with these parameters. The GOF plots observed vs population predicted 
indicate in particular for the higher concentration a systemic overestimation. This could also be clearly 
observed by inspecting the VPC plot, showing a clear overprediction of Cmax. In addition, an 
underprediction of exposure at later time points (from about 700 h post infusion) could be detected. 
The VPC was provided on linear scale only, limiting the possibility to comment on that. It should be 
provided on log scale as well.  
The model-based simulations indicate a trend towards higher exposures for paediatrics compared to 
adults and it should be kept in mind, that no patient received 100 mg. Simulations for this dose in 
paediatrics are based on higher doses only. No confirmatory data are available for this case (see also 
below). 
With regards to the boxplots (Figure 3 and Figure 4), there are deviations from the predicted exposure 
range for all paediatric weight ranges compared to the adult population. This deviation appears to 
increase with weight and is highest for the weight group >40 kg. Given that this body weight group is 
expected to be most similar to the adult population, this finding is counter-intuitive and questions the 
predictive power.  A large proportion of outliers especially at the higher end of the predicted exposure 
range could be detected. This indicates that the model is not able to describe the observed paediatric 
data well, which is of concern.  
Overall, it is doubted that the herein presented paediatric population PK model can be considered 
reliable and fit for the purpose of dose selection and dose confirmation to shape further clinical 
development for the paediatric population.  
Study population, dose selection and confirmation for the paediatric population 
Overall, 28 paediatric patients were included in the analysis. It is not clear how many of those were EM 
or CM patients, so the paediatric study population is considered not well described.  
In addition, a participant received a dose of 150 mg instead of the foreseen 100 mg. Moreover, it 
seems that one patient received inadvertently 200 mg instead of 150 mg. No justification and 
comment could be found for this, respectively. It should be noted that no confirmatory data following 
100 mg are available for the lowest paediatric weight cohort (<20 kg).  
Besides the comments made regarding the model, the following comments regarding the selected 
doses are made. Firstly, it is not clear why exposure matching for the higher adult dose (300 mg IV) is 
primarily targeted in paediatrics, although the general recommended dose in adults is 100 mg. 
Considering that a flat exposure-response relationship was observed previously, it appears not 
plausible, why the exposure of the higher dose should be targeted. It should be avoided to expose 
patients to higher doses than actual needed.  
Secondly, back-calculating the proposed paediatric doses of 100, 150, and 300 mg to body-weight 
doses, results in doses of about up to 7.5 mg/kg (body weight 15 to 40 kg). Compared to that, an 
adult weighing 70 kg receives 1.43 mg/kg (100 mg IV dose, generally recommended dose) and 4.29 
mg/kg (300 mg IV dose), respectively. Considering the PK differences in paediatrics (e.g. clearance) 
and given that body weight affects clearance processes and volumes of distributions, the proposed 
higher per kg doses are not understood. In addition, a body weight effect was already observed in the 
adult population, resulting in higher exposure for lighter patients receiving the same dose as all other 
adults (i.e. 39 kg resulted in 50 % higher exposure, refer to SmPC).   
All taken together, the provided paediatric population PK model is not considered acceptable for the 
indented context of use and thus should be revised and re-assessed. Paediatric dose selection should 
be further supported by consecutive exposure simulations targeting both authorized adult doses (100 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/399588/2023

mg and 300 mg IV). Simulation should be performed considering also other body weight limits (smaller 
increment), as well as more doses over a broad dose range (e.g. 10 different doses) to be overlaid 
with the observed adult exposure range. (OC) 
3.1.5.  Conclusion  
The provided paediatric population PK model is not considered fit for the purpose of dose selection and 
dose confirmation in paediatrics. The model should be revised, and additional doses be simulated / 
investigated. One OC is asked that needs to be addressed by the MAH. 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a study report for: 
• 
Trial No. 18922A: An open-label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study to evaluate IV 
eptinezumab in children and adolescents with migraine, followed by an optional, multiple-dose, open-
label extension period (Main Study Period completed, Extension Period ongoing) 
Trial 18922A was initiated in 2020. This first study of eptinezumab in paediatric patients (18922A) was 
conducted as part of a global development programme for eptinezumab in paediatric patients with 
migraine as per the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed with the EMA and initial paediatric study 
plan (iPSP) agreed with the FDA. The results and outcome of the study will be reported in the Clinical 
Study Report (CSR) but no comparison with adults will be included. The present popPK report 
describes the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling and model-based simulations performed 
to support the eptinezumab dose recommendation for paediatric patients and also includes comparison 
with adults. 
First patient first visit – 4 August 2020 (the date when the first Informed Consent Form was signed) 
Data cut-off date – 20 October 2022 (the date of the last protocol-specified contact with any patient in 
the Main Study Period) 
As of the date of the submitted study report, the Extension Period was ongoing. 
3.2.2.  Clinical study 
Methods 
Study participants 
The trial included children and adolescents (6 to 17 years of age) with a diagnosis of migraine with or 
without aura according to ICHD-3 for ≥6 months prior to the Screening Visit and who had a frequency 
of migraine ≥4 MMDs for ≥3 months prior to the Screening Visit and who are requiring migraine 
prevention treatment. 
Treatments 
Each patient received a single open-label dose of eptinezumab IV based on the highest target adult 
exposure of eptinezumab (300 mg IV). The dose was adjusted for the patient’s body weight according 
to the following guidelines (the paediatric dose adjustments are based on simulations using a 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

population PK (popPK) model to optimally match eptinezumab exposure following a 300 mg IV dose in 
adults): 
− Patients weighing ≤20 kg received eptinezumab 100 mg IV 
− Patients weighing >20 to ≤40 kg received eptinezumab 150 mg IV 
− Patients weighing >40 kg received eptinezumab 300 mg IV 
Treatment doses were adjusted accordingly if a patient changed weight bands during the study 
(Extension Period).

Participants were followed-up for PK and safety tests until Day 169. 
Analysis of the Exploratory Endpoints 
Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Total Scores  
The impact of migraines on children’s day-to-day activities was assessed by patients and parents or 
caregivers, as applicable, who completed the PedMIDAS. The total score is a simple composite of the 
total of 6 questionnaire items. A score of 0 to 10 indicates little or no disability, 11 to 30 mild disability, 
31 to 50 moderate disability, and more than 50 severe disability. 
At Baseline, the median (min, max) PedMIDAS total score was slightly lower for children than for 
adolescents (39.0 [14, 132] versus 45.5 [0, 143]).  
The absolute value and change from Baseline in the PedMIDAS disability score were descriptively 
summarized by visit and study period. Shifts from Baseline to each post-Baseline visit are presented 
for the PedMIDAS disability score categories (little to no disability, mild disability, moderate disability, 
and severe disability) by visit and study period. 
Summaries and school status data are presented for the APTS_A and APTS_B for the Main Study 
Period and Extension Period, respectively. 
Number of MMDs and MHDs 
The treatment effect on the change from Baseline in number of MMDs and MHDs (Weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 
9 to 12, and 1 to 12) was calculated using 28-day intervals and summarized for the subset of patients 
with available eDiary data in the Main Study Period.

Sample size 
A minimum of 32 patients were planned for enrolment: 16 children (aged 6 to 11 years) and 16 
adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years). 
However, due to recruitment difficulties, an interim population PK analysis was performed ad hoc 
based on data from 16 adolescents and 7 children. Based on that, the inclusion of 16 children as 
originally intended was deemed not necessary. 
Following agreement with US FDA, EMA, and MHRA on a reduction of sample size of the children 
cohort, enrolment into the study was stopped when 16 adolescents and 12 children had been treated. 
Results 
Baseline data 
The median age of the participants in this trial was 13.5 years (range 6 to 17 years), most participants 
were female (71%) and White or Caucasian (86%). At Baseline, 11 children had a weight >20 and ≤40 
kg and 1 child had a weight >40 kg; all 16 adolescents had a weight >40 kg. 
The median PedMIDAS total score at Baseline was slightly lower for children than for adolescents (39.0 
versus 45.5). 
Before the Screening Visit, 3 children (25%) and 8 adolescents (50%) had used preventive 
headache/migraine medication.

Number analysed 
Overall, 28 paediatric participants (12 children and 16 adolescents) with migraine were treated in the 
Main Study Period, of which 25 (11 children and 14 adolescents) have completed that period. Three 
participants withdrew from the trial – 1 child (withdrawal of consent) and 2 adolescents (lost to follow-
up and “other” reason [“too busy with school and could not continue”]). 
Based on baseline demographic data, both, patients with episodic and with chronic migraine, have 
been included. However, the respective numbers and distribution of patients with CM and EM across 
age groups does not become clear. 
Safety results 
The system organ classes with the highest incidences of TEAEs (>15% in either age group) were 
infections and infestations (4 children [33%]; 1 adolescent [6%]), psychiatric disorders (3 children 
[25%]; 1 adolescent [6%]), and vascular disorders (0 children; 3 adolescents [19%]). The only TEAE 
(preferred term) that was reported for more than 1 patient was orthostatic hypotension, which 
occurred in 3 adolescents (19%). All other TEAEs occurred as single events in single patients only. All 
events of orthostatic hypotension occurred in relation to infusion, resolved quickly/within the same 
day, were assessed as non-serious, mild or moderate, and related to IMP. 
• 
Four (14%) patients had infusion-related reactions (migraine in 1 child; cough and rhinorrhoea 
in 1 child; and orthostatic hypotension in 2 adolescents). 
•  None of the patients had TEAEs leading to death, serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs 
leading to IMP modification, temporary interruption of IMP, withdrawal of IMP, or withdrawal 
from the study. 
• 
The mean changes from Baseline in clinical safety laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG 
parameters, and shifts in height and body mass index percentiles were generally small in both 
age groups, with no clinically relevant findings. In general, few patients had post-Baseline PCS 
values across the variables. With the exception of 1 adolescent with clinically significant post-
Baseline vital signs values (low diastolic and systolic blood pressure) and an associated TEAE of 
orthostatic hypotension, the post-Baseline PCS values across the variables were considered not 
clinically relevant.

Two patients had suicidal ideation as assessed using the C-SSRS (wish to be dead [C-SSRS 
score of 1] and non-specific active suicidal thoughts [C-SSRS score of 2] in a child and wish to 
be dead in an adolescent). These 2 patients reported associated TEAEs of depression and 
adjustment disorder with depressed mood, respectively. 
Two adolescents were positive for ADAs in a confirmatory assay: 1 at Week 20 and 1 at Weeks 
12 and 20, but neither had NAbs. No child was positive for ADAs. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (NCA) and Efficacy Results 
After a single IV administration of eptinezumab to paediatric patients, eptinezumab Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were similar between dose level/weight group. The median terminal t½ for eptinezumab was similar 
between dose levels: 27.5 days (659.5 hours) and 29.2 days (699.9 hours) for the 150 mg and 300 
mg dose levels, respectively. In the heavier patients who received 300 mg eptinezumab, the geometric 
mean CL was faster and Vz was larger by approximately 2-fold when compared to the lighter patients 
who received 150 mg. As only 1 patient was in a different category when results were summarized by 
age group, similar trends were observed when comparing by age group. 
Plasma PK parameters of eptinezumab by dose level/weight group are summarized in Panel 15.

A single IV administration of eptinezumab at 150 mg or 300 mg, depending on the body weight, 
resulted in overlapping mean plasma concentration-time curves in paediatric participants 6 to 17 years 
of age. Plasma exposure, in terms of Cmax and AUC0-inf, was similar between dose levels/weight 
groups/age groups. CL and Vz were different between dose levels/weight groups/age groups with 
heavier participants administered 300 mg eptinezumab displaying faster CL and a larger Vz by 
approximately 2-fold compared to lighter participants administered 150 mg. The plasma t1/2 of

eptinezumab was similar between dose levels with median of 27.5 days and 29.2 days for the 150 mg 
and 300 mg dose levels, respectively. 
Overall, the PK profile of eptinezumab in paediatric participants 6 to 17 years of age was similar 
between dose levels/weight groups/age groups, except for CL and Vz. 
Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Total Scores 
An improvement in disability was seen in both age groups, with a median (min, max) score change 
from Baseline to Week 12 of -22.0 (-70, -6) in children and -17.0 (-117, 42) in adolescents. 
The analysis of the shift in PedMIDAS disability score categories from Baseline to Week 12 showed 
improvements in disability in 9 children and 6 adolescents, no change in 2 children and 8 adolescents, 
and worsened disability in 1 adolescent (change from mild at Baseline to severe at Week 12). This, 
however, corresponds to 42% (18% children, and 60% adolescents) without benefit in PedMIDAS.

There were operational issues with implementation of the eDiary, especially in the younger age group 
in which children and parents or caregivers were expected to provide separate reports, and also poor 
compliance was noted in some patients. In consequence, only about one-third of the patients provided 
data from the Screening Visit until Week 12 and could be evaluated for the change in number of MMDs 
and MHDs from Baseline to the monthly averages. 
A summary of MMDs and MHDs is provided in Table above. Due to problems with the eDiary data 
collection and the low number of patients who completed the eDiary from the Screening Visit until 
Week 12, this exploratory evaluation provided only limited data, and the results for MMDs and MHDs 
are difficult to interpret. 
Safety 
The SOCs with the highest incidences of TEAEs (>15% in either age group) were: 
• infections and infestations (4 children [33%]; 1 adolescent [6%]) 
• psychiatric disorders (3 children [25%]; 1 adolescent [6%]) 
• vascular disorders (0 children; 3 adolescents [19%]) 
The only TEAE (preferred term) that was reported for more than 1 patient was orthostatic hypotension, 
which occurred in 3 adolescents (19%) (see section 10.1.4 for details). All other TEAEs occurred as 
single events in single patients only. 
1 child was inadvertently infused with 200 mg instead of 150 mg eptinezumab. For this case a TEAE of 
accidental overdose was reported. 
Thirteen (46%) patients had TEAEs with a maximum intensity of mild. Seven (25%) patients had 
TEAEs with a maximum intensity of moderate. None of the patients had a severe TEAE. 
Nine (32%) patients had at least 1 TEAE related to IMP. TEAEs related to IMP in the 3 children were 
migraine and photopsia, sleep terror, and cough and rhinorrhea. TEAEs related to IMP in the 6 
adolescents were orthostatic hypotension (in 3 adolescents), adjustment disorder with depressed 
mood, pruritus, and dizziness. 
Infusion-related Reactions 
Four (14%) patients had at least one infusion-related reaction. Infusion-related reactions were 
migraine (verbatim term: worsening migraine) in 1 child, cough and rhinorrhoea in 1 child, and 
orthostatic hypotension in 2 adolescents. Of note, 2 additional adolescents had TEAEs (1 adolescent 
had orthostatic hypotension and 1 had adjustment disorder with depressed mood) on the day of the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

infusion after the infusion was started, which were assessed as related to IMP but not classified as 
infusion-related reactions by the investigators. 
The 3 adolescents with orthostatic hypotension all received the IMP infusion at the same study site. All 
events were non-serious and related to IMP. The intensity was moderate for 2 adolescents and mild for 
1 adolescent. Of note, the TEAE of orthostatic hypotension in 1 adolescent is listed twice since a 
change in intensity from moderate to mild was recorded for the last minute of the event. Site queries 
confirmed that patients reported symptoms as “dizzy, sweaty and hot”, “dizzy, lightheaded, and hot”, 
and “clammy and nauseous”. All events resolved on the same day (resolution was reported after 5 
min, 9 min, and exact time unknown but on the same day). No other TEAEs were reported for these 
adolescents on the same day, and the orthostatic hypotension did not lead to IMP modification, 
temporary interruption of IMP, withdrawal of IMP, or withdrawal from the study. 
Clinical Safety Laboratory Test Results 
For all laboratory values, the mean changes from Baseline were generally small in both age groups, 
with no clinically relevant findings. 
The urine laboratory tests showed no relevant findings in either age group 
Four patients had post-Baseline PCS (potentially clinically significant) haematology values (Listing 
16.2.8.1.1.1a): 
• One child had PCS low haematocrit values at all study visits, including Screening and Baseline. This 
child also had PCS low haemoglobin values at Screening, Baseline, and Week 4.  
• Two adolescents had PCS high eosinophil values: 1 at Baseline and Week 20, and 1 at Week 20. 
Immunogenicity 
Two adolescents were positive for ADAs in a confirmatory assay: 1 at Week 20 and 1 at Weeks 12 and 
20, but neither had NAbs. No child was positive for ADAs. 
3.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  scope  of  this  study  18922A,  an  open-label,  single-dose,  pharmacokinetic  study  to  evaluate  IV 
eptinezumab in children and adolescents with migraine, followed by an optional, multiple-dose, open-
label extension period (Main Study Period completed, Extension Period ongoing), was to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetic profile of eptinezumab after a single intravenous administration in paediatric patients 
6  to  17  years  of  age.  Secondary  objectives  were  to  characterize  the  PK  profile  of  eptinezumab  after 
multiple IV administrations in the context of an extension study, and to evaluate immunogenicity. 
In  the  study  patients  weighing  >20  to  ≤40  kg  received  a  single  dose  of  eptinezumab  150  mg  IV  and 
patients weighing >40 kg received a single dose of eptinezumab 300 mg IV. In total, 28 patients with 
migraine were included and treated in the Main Study Period. Thereof, 11 patients were included in the 
weight group 20-40 kg (39%) and 17 patients (61%) in the weight group >40kg. The mean age of the 
patients was 12.6 years and the mean weight 51.1kg. 
To  characterize  the  PK  profile,  blood  samples  were  collected  and  analysed  at  screening,  baseline 
(immediately after end of infusion and 2 hours after end of infusion), and at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 20.  
The following PK-Parameters were analysed: AUC0-inf, Cmax, AUC0-tlast, Cmin (C12wk), tmax, T1/2, CL, Vz.

The  currently  provided  results  for  the  PK-Parameter  Cmax,  AUC0-inf  and  T1/2  after  a  single  IV 
administration of eptinezumab appears to be similar between the weight groups >20 kg to ≤40kg and 
the  weight  group  >40  kg  and  no  major  differences  between  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  treated  group 
were  observed  based  on  the  concentration-time  curves  provided.  The  t1/2  was  similar  between  dose 
levels with a median of 27.5 days and 29.2 days for the 150 mg and 300 mg respectively. However, 
differences  have  been  observed  in  clearance  (geometric  mean:  0.001709  L/h  vs.  0.003190  L/h)  and 
volume of distribution (geometric mean: 1.591 L vs. 3.233 L) between both dose levels/weight groups 
(150 mg vs. 300 mg). Heavier participants administered 300 mg eptinezumab demonstrating a faster 
CL and a larger Vz by approximately 2-fold compared to lighter participants administered 150 mg. In 
addition,  small  difference  was  observed  for  C12wk  (geometrical  mean  for  150  mg:  6.440  µg/mL  vs 
geometrical mean for 300 mg: 9.707 µg/mL) and differences in the median for tmax between the lower 
dose  level/lighter  weight  group  (median:  0.6830h)  and  the  higher  dose  level/weight  group  (median: 
2.483h)  were  observed,  but  with  overlapping  quartiles  (Q1,  Q3).  In  addition,  the  lower  dose 
level/lighter weight group showed a higher intra-subject variability (GeoCV %: between 31.9%-117%) 
compared  to  the  higher  dose  level/weight  group  (GeoCV%  between  18.3%-33.9%).  Moreover,  the 
number of children (n=11) and adolescents (n=16) included in this study was quite small.  
However, based on the data provided, the PK profile of eptinezumab in pediatric participants appears 
similar  overall  between  the  dose  levels/weight  groups  evaluated  in  this  study,  except  for  CL  and  Vz. 
Nevertheless,  there  are  currently  still  concerns  regarding  the  selected  dosing  regimen  and  the 
robustness  of  the  Pop-PK  model  used  in  this  study.  It  would  have  been  desirable  to  select  the  dose 
recommended  in  the  SmPC  for  adults  (100  mg)  rather  than  the  maximum  dose  (300  mg)  tested  in 
adults,  to  avoid possible unnecessary  overdose.  However,  eptinezumab  was  well  tolerated  in  children 
and adolescents so far and it was already agreed in the PIP [P/0091/2022 European Medicines Agency 
decision  dated  11  March  2022]  to  cover  both  doses  (100  mg  and  300  mg)  in  the  paediatric 
development  program.  In  addition,  as  stated  by  the  applicant,  the  PK-sampling  is  included  in  the 
ongoing efficacy and safety trials (19356A, 19357A, and 19379A), and the paediatric popPK model will 
be updated accordingly when these data become available. Therefore, the final paediatric doses will be 
decided based on all available paediatric data (Trials 18922A, 19356A, 19357A, and 19379A).  
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  eptinezumab  in  this  pediatric  population  was  evaluated  as  an  exploratory 
objective. 
There was a trend to clinical improvement in PedMIDAS disability scores across age groups. This result 
was to some extend supported by MMD and MHD analyses, but due to problems with the eDiary data 
collection  and  the  low  number  of  patients  who  completed  the  eDiary  from  the  Screening  Visit  until 
Week 12, this exploratory evaluation provided only limited data which need to be handled with care. 
Overall,  eptinezumab  was  well  tolerated  in  children  and  adolescents.  No  new  safety  signals  were 
identified. 
No changes to the product information are proposed.

Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
Lundbeck considers the paediatric population PK model (that has been submitted in the population PK 
report) to be sufficiently robust and hence no revision of the model is deemed necessary. Simulations 
with several different doses were performed (Table 4 ). The results of the simulations are shown in

Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 for AUC0-Wk12 and Cmax, respectively. The original proposed 
doses for children and adolescents (for 100 mg adult equivalent 40, 50, and 100 mg 
[Table 4 scenario A] and for 300 mg adult equivalent 100, 150, and 300 mg [Table 4 scenario G] for 
weight groups of <20 kg, 20-40 kg, and >40 kg, respectively) were considered as best results.  
The use of the 60% to 140% criterion was accepted by the EMA/PDCO in PIP modification 03 
(P/0341/2022; European Medicines Agency decision dated 10 August 2022).

Model development:  
A population PK analysis was used to estimate PK parameters and their variability from concentration 
data. Due to data sparseness issues, available datasets often do not allow the estimation of all 
parameters of the suitable model. The $PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM supports the estimation of some

the dataset. The flow of the population PK analysis of Trial 18922A using prior information is depicted

Panel 8 – Flowchart of the popPK analysis for trial 18922A using prior 
In the paediatric population PK analysis of eptinezumab, the $PRIOR functionality in NONMEM was 
implemented. As prior information for the paediatric population PK analysis, the final adult population 
PK model was used and that model included the covariates body weight, creatinine clearance capped at 
a physiological value of 150 mL/min (CLcr_cap), disease state (healthy, CM or EM patients) and 
baseline MMDs on CL, and body weight, sex, and disease state on the Vc. However, these adult 
covariates were not included or investigated in the paediatric population PK analysis, and they were 
just used to describe the average adult PK parameters in the prior part of the model. The same 
approach/method/conditions was/were used in the interim population PK submitted in PIP modification 
03, which was approved by EMA on 10 August 2022 (P/0341/2022; European Medicines Agency 
decision dated 10 August 2022). 
To use parameters from the final adult model as prior information, the medians or most frequent 
values of the covariates had to be assumed to obtain the “average” for the adult population, but no 
assumption or values were imputed for the paediatric population PK analysis. For example, the 
relationship between CL and baseline MMDs for adults is CL = CLbase*(MDbase/13)0.044, and to 
obtain the average CL (that is, CLbase), baseline MMDs of 13 would have to be assumed. 
With regards to covariates and the paediatric population PK analysis, the objective was to investigate 
the impact of body weight and age. These two covariates, together with sex, were included in the 
covariate model building for paediatrics. The results of the covariate step in the model building are 
described in section 4.3.2 of the Population Pharmacokinetic Report and copied as following:

When body weight was included in the model, age or sex had no significant impact on the PK 
parameters. An alternative (that was not included in the population PK report) to using the final adult 
model as information for the prior model is to use the base adult model (that is, the structural model 
without covariates) instead. The paediatric population PK model has been re-run with this other prior 
information and the results are the same with regards to the covariates and in general very similar. 
Fixing the power of the weight effect to 0.75 for clearances and 1.0 for volumes of distribution gave 
the best results (largest decrease in objective function value) and when body weight was included in 
the model, age or sex had no significant impact on the PK parameters. The results of the covariate 
step with the base adult model as prior information are summarized in Table 6. Goodness-of-fit plots 
that use the final adult model and base adult model as prior information are presented in Figure 10.

The VPC is presented in semi-log scale in Figure 11. There seems to be an overprediction of Cmax. In 
addition, there appears to be an underprediction of exposure at later time points (from about 700 h 
post-infusion). This is not a result of a poor predictive model, but rather, due to limitations in the use 
of the VPC, since different doses are part of the input dataset. If prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) - 
which accounts for differences in the input dataset - is used instead, the model seems more predictive. 
The pcVPCs are presented in both linear and semi-log scale in Figure 12.

Assessment of the Applicant’s Response  
The requested model revision was not performed. Additional simulations using the previous model 
were presented. It is acknowledged that the requested information on the LLOQ (50 ng/mL) was 
provided. Moreover, it was explained that information on disease state (CM and EM) are not available 
for Study 18922A. And as requested, the VPC was presented on semi-log scale. 
Population PK model and simulations: 
Additional explanations were provided helping to better understand how the paediatric population PK 
model was developed. Considering these along with the earlier provided information from the 
population pharmacokinetic report PLUTO ID CLI_01848467, it is anticipated that the final population 
PK model for paediatrics consists of the following aspects: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
2-compartment model 
zero order absorption 
first-order elimination

and Q (based on priors from adults) are listed in Table 1 (CL= 0.00469 L/h, Q=0.0420 
L/h).

Residual error: “Residual error was modelled as combined proportional and additive”, but the 
additive error could not be found in the list of final parameter estimates (Table ). 
A few additional simulations were carried out using this final paediatric population PK model. The 
following doses were simulated using the same body weight increments as before (<20 kg, 20-40 kg, 
>40 kg, and >45 kg) and were not tested for smaller increments, which could have been informative. 
Note: the labelling of graphics Panels 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicate ≤20kg, 20-40 kg, and >40 kg.

These simulations still do not provide a lot of additional information on other potential doses for each 
body weight cohort. Simulations over broad dose ranges, e.g. 10 different doses per paediatric (body 
weight) group, were requested and thought to inform on potential other (better / lower) doses. 
Unfortunately, this was not provided. A few comments are given with respect to the provided 
simulations: 
•  Based on the simulations (Panel 3-5), lower doses than currently proposed might be sufficient, 
given that a flat exposure-response has been described earlier, and because exposures tend to 
exceed the upper boundary of adults ranges (e.g. for 100 mg adult equivalent: ≤ 20 kg: 30 mg 
[Panel 2B], >20 kg to <40 kg: 40 mg [Panel 2E], 40 – 45 kg: 80 mg [Panel 2E]. For 300 mg 
adult dose equivalent, considering AUC, lower doses than the proposed 100 mg were not 
simulated for the ≤ 20 kg group, which might be of interest).  
• 
It is confusing why for the <20 kg (or ≤ 20 kg?) group receiving 125 mg, exposure is higher in 
Panel 3H compared to 3G, although the dose is the same according to the labelling. 
•  Cmax values are higher for most of the paediatrics and tend to exceed the upper boundary. 
Overall comment: 
Although the provided overall documentation of this modeling exercise was presented in a minimalistic 
way, the overall concept of the model development and final composition appears clearer now. 
Nonetheless, the model´s fit for purpose is still doubted and its ability to relibly predict the PK in 
paediatrics down to 6 years of age not entirely convincing e.g. due to misspecification in the GOF plots 
or bootstrap results containing zero for two parameters (refer also to the previous critique). However, 
besides such aspects, the model-based simulations reveal a trend of generally higher exposure for the 
paediatric population compared to the adult exposure range. This is not considered acceptable since 
the large adult exposure range should not be targeted at the upper end. Interestingly, this is also the 
case for the higher body weight group of > 40 kg (presumably older paediatric ages), which would be 
expected to be closer to the adult exposures, compared to the lighter and presumably younger 
paediatric patients. Therefore, it is assumed that the doses are not adequate to match adult exposures 
or at least this cannot be adequately simualted with the underlying model. 
It is acknowleded that only very limited and variable paediatric data for mainly two different doses 
(150 mg and 300 mg) are available. (Note: one paediatric participant received 200 mg instead of 150 
mg and it is not clear if this was adequately flagged in the dataset as this is not listed in Table ). 
Considering this, it is acknowledged that analysing these data may be challenging, e.g. with respect to 
covariate investigations. However, given that this modelling exercises is used to inform on paediatric 
dosing of eptinezumab outside the tested doses and body weight ranges (i.e., dose below 150 mg  and 
body weight < 20 kg, down to 6 years of age), a robust and credible model should be aimed. 
Therefore, the MAH is encouraged to further investigate the PK and PKPD behaviour in the paediatric 
cohorts, maybe with potentially future emerging data through revision and update of the model. 
Conclusion 
From the pharmacometrics point of view, the proposed doses are not supported by the presented 
modelling results and the model is not considered fit for prupose. Given that a flat exposure-response 
behaviour was concluded earlier, lower doses might be sufficient for most of the proposed body weight 
/ age groups and should be considered. This should be further investigated to prevent exceeding the

previously agreed target exposure range, because this might lead to concerns at time of potential 
extention of indication for the paediatric population.  
The issue will not be further pursued in this P46 submission but will be further discussed during a 
possibly upcoming extension of indication application. 
Question  2:  Since  the  recommended  dose  for  adults  according  to  the  SmPC  of  Vyepti  is  100  mg,  a 
comprehensible justification for the dosing regimen chosen in this study and a direct comparison of the 
observed PK-Parameter between children, adolescents and adults (treated with 100 mg and 300 mg), 
including figures and tables, should be provided. 
MAH Response  
Both the 100 mg and 300 mg doses of eptinezumab are approved in adults. Based on the SmPC, the 
100  mg  dose  is  the  recommended  dose,  and  the  300  mg  dose  is  indicated  as  the  dose  that  “some 
patients may benefit from”. Given the availability of the 2 doses in adults, the paediatric development 
programme  was  designed  to  cover  both  these  doses,  as  agreed  in  the  PIP  [P/0091/2022  European 
Medicines  Agency  decision  dated  11  March  2022].  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  both  these 
eptinezumab  doses,  2  paediatric  efficacy  and  safety  trials  (19356A  and  19357A)  have  been  initiated 
and are currently ongoing. 
In  addition  to  these  2  trials,  1  long-term  extension  trial  [Trial  19379A]  is  ongoing  and  includes 
participants from Trials 19356A and 19357A. Trial 18922A is a PK and safety trial, where the highest 
adult dose of 300 mg was selected, since from a PK perspective – and in particular, from a safety and 
tolerability perspective - the 300 mg dose (weight-adjusted) could cover both the 100 mg and 300 mg 
doses  (Part  A  [single-dose]  of  the  trial  has  been  completed  and  Part  B  [multiple-dose  extension]  is 
ongoing). 
In  adults,  eptinezumab  displayed  linear  PK  for  doses  ranging  from  10  to  1,000  mg  and  the  popPK 
analysis of Trial 18922A also revealed linear and dose-proportional PK between 150 mg and 300 mg in 
the paediatric population. As part of the popPK analysis for Trial 18922A (Population Pharmacokinetic 
Report), simulated plasma concentration profiles for 13,300 virtual paediatric patients were undertaken 
for eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg IV (weight-adjusted) and the results were compared with adults. 
The simulations showed that paediatric plasma exposures (in terms of AUCs) were on average within 
10% to 20% above adult levels. Therefore, no adjustments to the PDCO/EMA approved doses (100 mg 
and  300  mg,  weight-adjusted)  for  children  and  adolescents  in  the  efficacy  and  safety  trials  (19356A 
and  19357A)  are  deemed  necessary  and  should  remain  unchanged  throughout  the  paediatric 
development programme. 
A direct comparison of the observed PK parameters between children (6-11 years), adolescents (12-17 
years), and adults (>17 years) is only possible for 300 mg, since no patient in Trial 18922A received 
eptinezumab  100  mg.  In  Panel  13,  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf  versus  weight  are  shown  for  children  and 
adolescents from Trial 18922A and compared to adult values from the 300 mg cohort in Trial ALD403-
CLIN-005 (single-dose eptinezumab trial in adult patients with CM). Note that in Trial 18922A, only one 
child  was  given  eptinezumab  300  mg.  As  can  be  seen  in  Panel  13,  there  is  as  expected  a  clear 
relationship  between  weight  and  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf,  but  the  adult  values  are  very  similar  to  the 
paediatric values at corresponding weight (green vertical line).

In conclusion, both the 100 mg and 300 mg doses of eptinezumab are approved in adults, and given 
that  2  doses  are  approved  in  adults,  the  patients  in  Trial  18922A  had  received  a  single  dose  of 
eptinezumab  IV  based  on  the  highest  approved  dose  in  adults  (300  mg),  since  from  a  safety  and 
tolerability perspective, the 300 mg dose (weight-adjusted) could cover both the 100 mg and 300 mg 
doses.  The  dosing  guideline  for  Trial  18922A  received  agreement  from  EMA/PDCO  (EMEA-002243-
PIP01-17-M01; Opinion of the Paediatric Committee on the acceptance of a modification of an agreed 
Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  dated  30  April  2020  [EMA/PDCO/86124/2020  Corr]),  which  reflects 
approval of the use of the highest approved adult dose for Trial 18922A. Based on the results of Trial 
18922A,  the  use  of  the  300  mg  dose  (weight-adjusted)  appears  justified,  in  that  it  allowed  a  more 
robust  (as  compared  to  if  the  100  mg  dose  had  been  used)  evaluation  of  eptinezumab’s  tolerability 
profile. Trial 18922A demonstrated that eptinezumab is well tolerated in children and adolescents, with 
no  serious  TEAEs,  severe  TEAEs,  or  TEAEs  leading  to  the  withdrawal  of  IMP,  and  with  no  new  safety 
signals identified. A direct comparison of the PK parameters suggests that paediatric values (based on 
Trial 18922A) correspond to adult values. In addition, simulations for 13,300 virtual paediatric patients 
that  were  performed  as  part  of  the  popPK  analysis  for  Trial  18922A  showed  that  paediatric  plasma 
exposures (in terms of AUCs)  were on average  within 10% to 20% above adult levels. Therefore, no 
adjustments to the PDCO/EMA approved doses (100 mg and 300 mg, weight-adjusted) for children and 
adolescents  in  the  efficacy  and  safety  trials  (19356A  and  19357A)  are  deemed  necessary  and  should 
remain unchanged throughout the paediatric development programme.

PK-sampling is included in both the efficacy and safety trials (19356A, 19357A, and 19379A), and the 
paediatric  popPK  model  will  be  updated  accordingly  when  these  data  become  available.  The  final 
paediatric doses will be decided based on all available paediatric data (that is, data from Trials 18922A, 
19356A, 19357A, and 19379A). 
Assessor’s Comment: 
Although, concerns currently remain regarding the selected dosing regimen and the robustness of the 
Pop-PK  model  used  in  this  study,  and  although  it  would  have  been  desirable  to  use  the  dose 
recommended  in  the  SmPC  for  adults  (100  mg)  rather  than  the  maximum  dose  (300  mg)  tested  in 
adults,  to  avoid  possible unnecessary  overdose,  the rationale  provided  by  the applicant  can  currently 
be acknowledged, since eptinezumab was well tolerated in children and adolescents and, furthermore, 
it  was  already  agreed  in  the  PIP  [P/0091/2022  European  Medicines  Agency  decision  dated  11  March 
2022] to cover both doses (100 mg and 300 mg) in the paediatric development program.  
In  addition,  as  stated  by  the  applicant,  the  PK-sampling  is  included  in  both  the  ongoing  efficacy  and 
safety  trials  (19356A,  19357A,  and  19379A),  and  the  paediatric  popPK  model  will  be  updated 
accordingly when these data become available. Thus, the final paediatric doses will be decided based 
on all available paediatric data (Trials 18922A, 19356A, 19357A, and 19379A).  
Therefore, the issue will currently not be pursued further.  
Question  3: Please clarify the number of children and of adolescents with chronic migraine and with 
episodic migraine, respectively.  
MAH Response  
The  data  collected in  Trial  18922A  did  not include  the  collection of  disease  state  (that is,  EM  or  CM), 
as,  given  the  nature  of  the  trial,  this  was  considered  out-of-scope;  the  trial’s  main  objective  was  to 
characterize  the  PK  profile  of  eptinezumab,  and  its  target  population  was  migraine  patients  requiring 
migraine prevention treatment (specifically, the inclusion criterion was: The patient has a diagnosis of 
migraine with or without aura as defined by ICHD-3 guidelines (in the opinion of the investigator) of at 
least  6  months  prior  to  the  Screening  Visit  and  is  requiring  migraine  prevention  treatment).  Trial 
18922A  had  only  included  the  use  of  eDiaries  in  a  subset  of  patients  (that  would  have  enabled 
confirmation of the patients’ disease states). Efficacy was only included as an exploratory objective in 
Trial 18922A, and the eDiaries were mainly meant to evaluate the operational aspect of the trial, and 
in  particular,  to  gain  insights  that  could  benefit  the  2  large  efficacy  and  safety  trials  (19356A  and 
19357A).  Although  information  on  disease  state  is  not  available,  an  approximate  diagnosis  based  on 
the retrospectively self-reported frequencies during the 3 months prior to enrolment (“Average number 
of headache days per 28 day period in the months prior to screening”; “Average number of migraine 
days  per  28  day  period  in  the  3  months  prior  to  screening”)  has  been  used  to  indicate  the  disease 
state. In total, 6 patients (2 children, 4 adolescents) reported a 3-month average of 15 to 28 monthly 
headache  days  and  at  least  8  MMDs,  which  approximately  corresponds  to  a  diagnosis  of  CM.  
The rest of the patients (N = 22 [10 children and 12 adolescents]) reported a monthly average of <15 
headache days, which corresponds to a diagnosis of EM.  
Assessor’s Comment: Although baseline data is missing, eDiary data indicates that both, EM and CM 
patients, were included into the evaluation. Issue not further pursued.

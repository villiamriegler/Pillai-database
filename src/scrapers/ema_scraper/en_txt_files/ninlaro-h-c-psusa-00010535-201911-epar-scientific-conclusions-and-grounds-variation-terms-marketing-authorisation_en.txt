Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ixazomib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on thrombotic microangiopathy from clinical trial(s), the literature, 
spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and 
in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between 
ixazomib and thrombotic microangiopathy is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC therefore 
recommends that the product information of products containing ixazomib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ixazomib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ixazomib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Update of sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
13/07/2023 
SmPC and PL 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported, 
to add a new warning on anaphylactic reaction and 
to add ‘anaphylactic reaction’ to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency ‘Not Known’, 
based on the cumulative review of MAH global 
database and literature search. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce minor editorial changes to the product 
information. 
therefore sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC have been 
updated to add a new warning on anaphylactic reaction and 
to add ‘anaphylactic reaction’ to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency ‘Not Known’.

261302 and the pharmacokinetics-guided dosing 
study 261303. The Package Leaflet has been updated

submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to bring the PI in line with the Excipients guideline 
(sodium statement in 4.4) and the FVIII guideline 
(traceability statement in 4.4) and QRD template 
(labelling). The requested variation proposed 
amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

dosing study 261303, several adverse reactions are added 
to the table e.g. ocular hyperaemia, drug eruption. In 
addition, the narrative on immunogenicity in the paragraph 
on the description of selected adverse events was updated. 
The package leaflet and the RMP have been updated 
accordingly.

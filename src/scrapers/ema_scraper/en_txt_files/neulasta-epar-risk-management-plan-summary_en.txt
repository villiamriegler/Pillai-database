PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Neulasta (Pegfilgrastim) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Neulasta.  The RMP details important risks of 
Neulasta, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Neulasta's risks. 
Neulasta's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how Neulasta 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Neulasta should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Neulasta's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Neulasta is authorized for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia (FN) in adult patients (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains 
pegfilgrastim as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Neulasta’s benefits can be found in 
Neulasta’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage.  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Neulasta. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks  
Important risks of Neulasta, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Neulasta's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Neulasta are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Neulasta.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B.  Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified risk:  Capillary leak syndrome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available 
data sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse 
event reporting.  There were no events of capillary leak syndrome 
in pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical studies. 
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after administration of 
multiple drugs, some of which include interleukins 
(Kai-Feng et al, BMC Cancer, 2011;11:204), gemcitabine 
(Baron et al, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol), 2006;18:90-91), 
doxorubicin (Krzesiński et al, Cardiol J, 2010;17:88-91), 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
(Al-Homaidhi et al, Bone Marrow Transpl, 1998;21(2):209-214), 
and interferon  
(Yamamoto et al, Arch Intern Med, 2002;25:481-482). Capillary 
leak syndrome has also been reported in relation to miscellaneous 
conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, postpartum state, 
and pustular psoriasis (Kai-Feng et al, BMC Cancer, 2011;11:204).

Important identified risk:  Sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available 
data sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse 
event reporting.  There were no events of sickle cell crisis in 
pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical studies. 
Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for sickle cell crisis 
(Rees et al, Lancet, 2010;376:2018-2031).  Factors such as 
infections, dehydration, low oxygen tension, acidosis, extreme 
physical exercise, physical or psychologic stress, alcohol, 
pregnancy, cold weather, and concomitant medical conditions (eg, 
sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, herpes) have been identified as the 
cause of sickle cell crisis  
(Yale et al, Am Fam Physician, 2000;61:1349-1356,1363-1344).

Important identified risk:  Glomerulonephritis 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available 
data sources, including clinical studies, postmarketing adverse 
event reporting and from the literature.  There were no events of 
glomerulonephritis (GN) in pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical 
studies. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Other than the cancer itself, no specific risk factors were identified 
for this patient population. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8 
•  PL Section 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
Important identified risk:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available 
data sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse 
event reporting.  The placebo-controlled clinical study data show a 
higher rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome in subjects 
receiving pegfilgrastim compared to subjects receiving placebo. 
Risk factors include concurrent chemotherapy and infections.  A 
number of studies have showed that elevated risk of interstitial 
pneumonia is associated with use of rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) (Huang et al, Ann Hematol, 2011;90:1145-1151; 
Katsuya et al, Leukemia & lymphoma, 2009;50:1818-1823).  
Interstitial pneumonitis and other interstitial lung diseases have 
been seen with other chemotherapy agents in the setting of lung 
cancer (Zimmerman et al, J Clin Onc, 1984;2:396-405), particularly 
in Japan (Camus et al, Br J Cancer, 2004;91 Suppl 2:S18-23).

Important potential risk:  Cytokine release syndrome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available 
data sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse 
event reporting.  There were no events of cytokine release 
syndrome in pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical studies. 
Patients receiving bi-specific antibodies and T cells engineered to 
express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor are at particularly 
high risk for cytokine release syndrome  
(Frey, Best Pract Res Clin Haematol, 2017;30(4):336-340).  The 
severity of the cytokine release syndrome mediating infusion 
reaction might be related to the number of circulating lymphocytes  
(Chung, Oncologist, 2008;13:725-732).  Among patients with B-cell 
malignancies, risk factors for developing cytokine release 
syndrome included higher bone marrow tumor burden, higher 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cell dose, 
bulk CD8+ T-cell selection, lymphodepletion using 
fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide, and presence of thrombocytopenia 
before lymphodepletion  
(Hay et al, Blood, 2017;130(21):2295-2306).

1.  INTRODUCTION 
On 06 December 2012 the MAH submitted a safety study report for study SP0961 including very 
limited paediatric data (3 subjects who were 17 years old at the time of inclusion) for Vimpat, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for 
paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in 
the study(ies) 
Lacosamide tablets (50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg), solution for infusion (10mg/ml), and syrup 
(10mg/ml) are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in adult and adolescent (16 to 18 years) patients with epilepsy. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The current study (SP0961) is an open label pilot study to assess the safety of lacosamide in subjects 
with uncontrolled PGTC seizures, and contains paediatric data.  
In the study oral lacosamide was administered to a target dose of a maximum of 400 mg/day after 
titration was completed.  
The MAH is submitting the final report for study SP0961 with the title “An open-label pilot study to 
assess the safety of oral lacosamide as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-
clonic seizures in subjects with idiopathic generalized epilepsy”. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study(ies) 
Description 
SP 0961 “An open-label pilot study to assess the safety of oral lacosamide as adjunctive therapy for 
uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in subjects with idiopathic generalized epilepsy” 
was a phase 2 study with 49 subjects enrolled at 19 sites in the US. 
Methods 
The objectives of the study were to assess the safety of lacosamide in subjects with uncontrolled 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Safety was 
assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory 
data, vital sign measurements, body weight, physical and neurological examination findings, as well as 
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for the evaluation of spike wave discharges. In addition, 
subjects kept a diary to record daily seizure activity. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide were also 
accessed via measurements of drug plasma concentrations. 
The study design was a multi center opel label pilot study. The baseline phase (4-week prospective) 
began with subject screening at Visit 1 (Week 0). Visit 1 was conducted to evaluate subject eligibility 
for enrolment into the study. Seizure frequency and type eligibility were verified by reliably

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

documented seizure history collected (eg, in a seizure diary) over the 12 weeks prior to the baseline 
phase. A study seizure diary was dispensed to subjects to record seizure frequency during the baseline 
phase.  
Subjects were contacted via telephone 2 weeks following Visit 1 to assess continued eligibility and 
were reminded of the importance of accurate seizure diary completion. Subjects returned to the clinic 
the morning of the day prior to Visit 2 (end of week 4) to begin 24-hour ambulatory EEG recordings. 
Subjects returned to the clinic approximately 24 hours later (Visit 2) for removal of the scalp 
electrodes and recording device return. The EEG recording was completed before subjects received 
their first dose of lacosamide.  
At the end of the baseline phase (completion of Visit 2), subjects commenced a 3-week titration phase. 
Dose titration began at lacosamide 100 mg/day (50 mg bid approximately 12 hours apart) for 1 week. 
Subjects returned to the clinic for Visit 3 (end of week 5), Visit 4 (end of week 6), and Visit 5 (end of 
week 7) and were instructed to increase their daily dose to lacosamide 200mg/day, lacosamide 
300 mg/day, and the target dose of lacosamide 400 mg/day, respectively, if deemed clinically 
appropriate. 
At the end of the titration phase (completion of Visit 5), the 6-week maintenance phase began.  
During the maintenance phase, Visit 6 (end of Week 8) and Visit 7 (end of Week 13; termination Visit) 
were conducted. Subjects returned to the clinic the morning of the day prior to Visit 6 to begin 24-hour 
ambulatory EEG recordings. Subjects returned to the clinic approximately 24 hours later (Visit 6) for 
removal of the scalp electrodes and recording device return.  
Subjects returned to the clinic for a termination visit (Visit 7) at the end of Week 13. Subjects who 
completed the maintenance phase were given the opportunity to take part in the open-label extension 
study (SP0962). Subjects who did not qualify for, or chose not to participate in, the open-label 
extension study (SP0962) began a 3-week End-of-Study phase after completion of the maintenance 
phase. If subjects discontinued prematurely from the study, an early Termination visit occurred, when 
the same assessments as the Termination visit (Visit 7) were performed. These subjects were not 
eligible to participate in the open-label extension study (SP0962). During the early termination visit, 
subjects were instructed to taper their lacosamide dose as appropriate.  
During the End-of-Study phase, those subjects on lacosamide 300 mg/day or lacosamide 400 mg/day 
were tapered gradually at a recommended decrease rate of lacosamide 200 mg/day per week (ie, 
lacosamide 400 mg/day to lacosamide 200 mg/day or lacosamide 300 mg/day to lacosamide 
100 mg/day). At the end of week 14, subjects returned to the clinic for an End-of-Taper visit. A final 
clinic visit was conducted 2 weeks after the subject’s last lacosamide dose (end of week 16).

Figure 1: Sp 0961 study schematic diagram 
A total of 49 subjects were recruited into the study. Of these 3 subjects were below 18 years (all were 
17 years old).  A total of 9 subjects prematurely discontinued during the study. The reasons for 
discontinuation were adverse events (AE) (5 subjects) and withdrawn consent (4 subjects). All subjects 
who discontinued were over 18 years old. 
The primary variables for assessing safety within SP0961 were: 
Change in seizure days with absence seizures from baseline phase to the maintenance phase 
Change in seizure days with myoclonic seizures from baseline phase to the maintenance phase 
Results 
•  Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Sparse blood sampling for PK analyses was performed, but the results were only presented as plasma 
concentrations listed by subject and no PK parameters were calculated. Thus, no PK results are 
presented in this assessment report. 
•  Safety 
Absence seizures 
The change in the number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from baseline phase to titration 
and treatment phases are shown in the table below:

Table 1 Change in the number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from baseline 
phase ( 4 week prospective) to titration and treatment phases 
The mean (±SD) number of days with absence seizures per 28 days was 4.65 (±8.48) in the Baseline 
Phase and 4.91 (±8.42) in the Titration Phase. The mean (±SD) change in number of days with 
absence seizures per 28 days from the Baseline Phase to the Titration Phase was 0.26 (±3.67). The 
median change in number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from the Baseline Phase to the 
Titration Phase was 0.00. 
The MAH has analysed change in number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from baseline to 
titration and from baseline to treatment phase by age of onset of diagnoses with subsets of <2, 2 to 
<5, 5 to <10, 10 to <15, 15 to <20, and ≥20 years. The evaluation of some of the age at onset of 
diagnosis subsets were found to be difficult to interpret due to the limited number of subjects. For the 
subsets with a larger number of subjects (5 to <10, 10 to <15, and 15 to <20 years), the MAH could 
find no clinically meaningful effect of age of onset on the change in number of days with absence 
seizures per 28 days from the baseline to the titration or from baseline to treatment phase. 
The MAH has also analysed the change in number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from 
baseline phase to titration phase and from baseline phase to treatment phase by concomitant AED use 
subsets (valproate, lamotrigine and other AEDs). The evaluation of subsets showed no clinical 
meaningful effect on the change in the number of days with absence seizures per 28 days from the 
baseline phase to titration phase and from baseline phase to treatment phase. 69% of the subjects had 
2 or 3 concomitant AEDs.  
As there was an increase in absence seizures in some subjects going from baseline to treatment phase 
in the study the MAH has summarized the absence in treatment by numbers as follows:

occurred in the baseline phase

Sixteen subjects (32.7%) who had absence seizures during the baseline phase also had absence 
seizures during the treatment phase. Six subjects (12.2%) had absence seizures during the treatment 
phase who did not have absence seizures during the baseline phase. Due to a CRF transcription error, 
1 of the 6 subjects was incorrectly reported to have absence seizures during the maintenance phase 
who did not have absence during the baseline phase. All in all 5 subjects (10.2%) had absence 
seizures during the treatment phase without having absence seizures during the baseline Phase. Four 
of the 5 subjects had a history of absence seizures prior to enrolment in SP0961. 
One additional subject who did not have absence seizures during the baseline phase or during 
treatment phase, terminated the study prematurely with an episode reported as petit mal status.  
Four of the 5 subjects had absence seizures during the titration phase and 1 subject had absence 
seizures during the maintenance phase. Three subjects experienced 21.64, 2.55, and 1.33 days, 
respectively, with absence seizures per 28 days during the titration phase, but none in the 
maintenance phase. One subject experienced 5.89 days with absence seizures per 28 days during the 
titration phase before discontinuing the study prematurely due to hallucinations. One subject did not 
have absence seizures in the titration phase and experienced 3.68 days with absence seizures per 28 
days in the maintenance phase. 
Assessment comment: The percentage of subjects who experienced an increase in absence seizures is 
around 10% (5 subjects). One additional subject who did not have absence seizures during the 
baseline phase or during treatment phase, terminated the study prematurely with an episode reported 
as petit mal status. It is acknowledged that the study is a small open study exploratory in nature, and 
it is therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these findings. However it cannot be excluded 
that lacosamide has caused a worsening of absence seizures in a minority of subjects. It is noted that 
all of the 5 patients; were 18 yrs and older.  
Myoclonic seizures 
The change in the number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from baseline phase to titration 
and treatment phases are shown in the table below: 
Table 3 Change in the number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from baseline 
phase (4 week prospective) to titration and treatment phases 
The mean (±SD) number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days was 4.66 (±7.98) in the 
baseline phase and decreased to 3.37 (±7.00) in the titration phase. The mean (±SD) change in 
number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to the titration phase was 
-1.29 (±6.26). (The median change in number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the 
baseline phase to the titration phase was 0.00.). The mean (±SD) number of days with myoclonic

seizures per 28 days was 4.66 (±7.98) in the baseline phase and decreased to 2.75 (±6.25) in the 
treatment phase. The mean (±SD) change in number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days 
from the baseline phase to the treatment phase was -1.91 (±6.34). The median change in number of 
days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to the treatment phase was 0.00 
The change in the number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to the 
treatment phase by age at onset of diagnosis subsets <2, 2 to <5, 5 to <10, 10 to <15, 15 to <20, 
and ≥20 years was evaluated. The evaluation of some age at onset of diagnosis subsets were found to 
be difficult to interpret due to the limited number of subjects. For the subsets with a larger number of 
subjects (5 to <10, 10 to <15, and 15 to <20 years) there was no clinically meaningful effect of age of 
onset on the change in number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to 
the treatment phase.  
The change in the number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to the 
treatment phase by concomitant AED use subsets (valproate, lamotrigine, and other AEDs [including 
all epileptic drugs except valproate and lamotrigine]) was evaluated. The evaluation of the subsets 
based on AED use showed no clinically meaningful effect on the change in the number of days with 
myoclonic seizures per 28 days from the baseline phase to the treatment phase. 69% of subjects were 
taking 2 or 3 concomitant AEDs 
Assessment comment: The study is a small open study exploratory in nature. Also due to the nature of 
this type of epilepsy and patient population it is acknowledged that no firm conclusions from the 
results on myoclonic seizures can be drawn.  
Other safety 
The MAH evaluated the change in PGTC seizures for exploratory purposes only as the 9 week 
treatment phase was not considered long enough to draw conclusions on efficacy.  The mean (±SD) 
change in number of PGTC seizures per 28 days from the combined baseline phase to the maintenance 
phase was -0.27 (±1.05) and from the combined baseline phase to the treatment phase 0.04 (±2.40). 
The median change in the number of PGTC seizures per 28 days from the combined baseline phase to 
the maintenance phase was -0.35 and from the combined baseline phase to the treatment phase was -
0.25. 
Overall, 43 subjects (87.8%) reported at least 1 TEAE during the study. TEAEs were similar to those 
seen in POS studies with the exception of those that are unique to the PGTC class of seizures (reported 
terms for petit mal epilepsy). Frequently reported TEAEs (>15%) were dizziness (19 subjects 
[38.8%]), nausea (13 subjects [26.5%]), headache (8 subjects [16.3%]), and somnolence (8 subjects 
[16.3]). 
No subjects died during the study. One serious TEAE of petit mal epilepsy (reported term: petit mal 
status) was reported during the study. 
A total of 9 subjects prematurely discontinued the study. The AEs leading to discontinuation included 
dizziness (1 subject); grand mal convulsion (reported term: increased generalized tonic-clonic seizures 
[1 subject]); petit mal epilepsy (reported term: increased absence seizures [1 subject]); vertigo, 
diplopia, gait disturbance, hallucination, nausea, sedation, vision blurred (1 subject); and petit mal 
epilepsy (reported term: petit mal status [1 subject]). The only “other significant TEAE” reported was 
alanine aminotransferase increased which occurred in 1 subject (again in a subject older than 18 years 
of age).

The median values for haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameters remained within the 
normal range, and the changes from baseline were not of clinical relevance. 
Assessment of or ECG parameters, vital sign parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure [systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure]), body weight, and results from physical and neurological examinations did 
not reveal any clinically relevant findings.  
Assessment comment: The pattern of Adverse Events in general for this small study seem to be in line 
with what is seen in patients treated with adjunctive Vimpat for partial-onset seizures which is the 
currently approved indication 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted data from a small open study assessing safety in uncontrolled PGTC seizures. 
The paediatric data from this small study consists of only 3 subjects who were all 17 years old at the 
time of inclusion.   
Although not significant it is of interest to note there seem to be a small increase in absence seizures 
in the study population during the titration phase of the study. None of the 5 subjects is below 18 yrs, 
and no conclusions can be drawn from these findings. There are reports in the literature of seizure 
exacerbation in juvenile IGE (Gelisse et al, Epilepsia 2004;45:1282-1286 and Perucca et al 
Epilepsia,39 (1):5-17,1998) in subjects treated with anti-epileptics.  
Assessment comment: The small increase in absence seizures in the study population could be of 
potential interest as none of the 5 subjects had absences at baseline. The MAH is asked to discuss this 
in more detail. 
Additional  CHMP comments: 
Overall, the conclusions are endorsed. In particular, the MAH should specify the epileptic syndrome of 
each patient who developed/experienced increase in absence seizures and discuss the possible 
evolution/worsening of seizure in the context of the specific epileptic syndrome. 
According to the Art.46 of Reg(EC)N.1902/2006, the MAH submitted available paediatric data from 
SP0961 study. This study includes a very limited number of paediatric subjects (only 3 out of 49 were 
17 years old at the time of inclusion), however a discussion on these subject’s results might have been 
useful. 
The primary objective of SP0961 was to assess the safety of lacosamide in subjects with uncontrolled 
PGTC seizure with IGE, whereas the efficacy in the reduction of PGTC seizure frequency was only 
evaluated for exploratory purposes. Overall, the results indicate that there was a small reduction in 
absence seizures and myoclonic seizures frequency from the baseline phase to the maintenance phase. 
However, it is of note that around 10% of the subjects experienced an increase in absence seizures 
during the treatment phase (including titration phase and maintenance phase) without having absence 
seizures during the baseline phase (one subject had no history of absence seizures prior to enrolment 
in SP0961). Due to the small number of subjects, the study results do not allow to draw conclusions 
either on efficacy or on safety in the paediatric population.   
2.3.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
The post-authorisation measure  is considered fulfilled. However, further action is required as detailed 
below.

2.4.  ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED 
1.  The small increase in absence seizures in the study population could be of potential interest as 
none of the 5 subjects had absences at baseline. The MAH is asked to discuss this in more 
detail and specify the epileptic syndrome of each patient who developed/experienced increase 
in absence seizures and discuss the possible evolution/worsening of seizure in the context of 
the specific epileptic syndrome 
2.  This study includes a very limited number of paediatric subjects (only 3 out of 49 were 17 
years old at the time of inclusion), the applicant is however requested to provide a discussion 
on these subject’s results. 
This information was requested to be provided and will be assessed in the context of Periodic Safety 
Update Report (PSUR) #6.

1.  Introduction 
On 30 March 2021,  the MAH  submitted a completed paediatric study for Stelara (ustekinumab), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended.A short critical expert 
overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin  G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that  binds both 
human interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23  via a common IL-12/23p40  subunit.  Ustekinumab neutralizes the 
activities of IL-12 and IL-23 by preventing these cytokines from binding to the  IL-12 receptor beta-1 
receptor protein, which is expressed on the surface of immune cells. 
The current Article 46 submission summarizes the efficacy and safety data from the long-term 
extension (LTE)  period of the completed CNTO1275PSO3013 or CADMUS Junior (hereafter referred to 
as PSO3013).  PSO3013 was an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity of ustekinumab in  children aged from ≥6 to <12  years with moderate to  severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis which allowed paediatric subjects who have demonstrated clinical benefit through 
week 52 of the main study to  continue receiving ustekinumab 
The results of the main study (through  Week 56) have been submitted  previously 
(EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073),  and formed the basis of the extension of indication  to children aged 6 to 
12 years with  moderate to severe psoriasis. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Ustekinumab was supplied as a liquid in vial for administration  by subcutaneous injection. There was a 
single drug concentration (ie, 45 mg in 0.5 mL volume). Each 0.5 mL of ustekinumab solution contains 
45 mg ustekinumab, L-histidine,  sucrose, and polysorbate 80 at pH  6.0. Four ustekinumab lot numbers 
were used in the LTE  of the  study (4374328,  4375688,  4376094,  4378527). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted  the final long-term extension clinical study report for: 
•

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CNTO1275PSO3013 CADMUS Jr 
Description 
The CNTO1275PSO3013 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and immunogenicity of ustekinumab during up to  5 years of continuous  treatment in paediatric 
subjects ≥6 to  <12 years of age with  moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  
This open-label study consisted of a main study through  Week 56 (previously assessed under 
EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073)  followed by a long-term extension (LTE) through  Week 264 to allow 
paediatric subjects who have demonstrated clinical benefit through Week 52  of the  main study to 
continue receiving ustekinumab. The LTE is the focus of this  assessment. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The objective of the LTE of the study was to allow paediatric subjects who demonstrated clinical benefit 
through Week 52 of the main study to continue receiving ustekinumab and to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of ustekinumab in paediatric subjects aged ≥6 through  <12 years with  moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis.  
The endpoints evaluated during the LTE  of the  study were: 
• 
• 
• 
the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of cleared (0) over time. 
the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) over time. 
the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of mild or better (≤2) over time. 
Study design 
PSO3013 was an open-label multicenter study conducted at multiple  sites in Europe, US, and Canada 
that  evaluated the safety, efficacy, and PK of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects ≥6 to <12 years of age, 
with  moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

As outlined earlier in this report, the main study was the focus of Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073.  Both study design and results to week 56 were previously assessed and so 
will not  be described in  detail in this assessment report.  
After the main study through Week 56,  subjects who met entry criteria (had a beneficial response from 
ustekinumab treatment as determined by the investigator, and who had not yet reached the age of 12 
years or older in countries where marketing authorization for ustekinumab had been granted for the 
treatment of psoriasis in adolescent patients ≥12 to <18  years of age), were allowed to enter the LTE.  
The LTE was considered completed when all subjects had either terminated participation  according to 
the above criteria or completed their follow-up at Week 264. 
CHMP’s comment 
The MAH is requested to  confirm that the LTE was part of the agreed EMA paediatric investigation plan, 
which received a positive opinion from EMA Paediatric Committee on compliance with  a PIP, as 
presented under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073. 
The MAH has clarified has clarified that  the LTE of CNTO1275PSO3013  was part of the overall study 
design but was not part of the key binding  elements of the PIP.  
Study population /Sample size 
The subject population was comprised of paediatric subjects ≥6 to <12  years of age with  a diagnosis of 
plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months  prior to first study drug administration  and with  moderate to 
severe disease defined by PASI ≥12, PGA ≥3, and body surface area (BSA) ≥10%. The planned total 
sample size for the  main study was approximately 40 subjects. A total of 44 subjects were enrolled in 
the main study. Of the 39 subjects who completed participation in the main study through  Week 56, 
28 subjects participated in the LTE. 
Treatments 
Details about the dosing regimen and administration of ustekinumab through Week 40 were previously 
presented under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073.  Briefly, all subjects enrolled in the  study were to receive 
subcutaneous (SC) ustekinumab at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by a maintenance dose every 12 weeks 
thereafter, with  the last  dose at Week 40.   
Subject dosing was based on body weight measured at each visit and the dose of ustekinumab was 
adjusted accordingly as follows: 
•  0.75  mg/kg in subjects weighing <60  kg 
•  45 mg in subjects weighing ≥60 kg to ≤100 kg 
•  90 mg in subjects weighing >100  kg 
Eligible subjects who entered the  LTE received ustekinumab q12w  beginning at Week 56 and continued 
treatment according to criteria defined in Section 3.1.1.

Statistical Methods 
Observed data were summarised and no imputation rules were applied. In addition to the summaries 
over time, line plots were created displaying proportions and exact 95%  confidence intervals of 
subjects achieving a PGA score of cleared (0), and of cleared (0) or minimal (1)  over time. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 28 subjects participated in the LTE. All 28  (100%) subjects discontinued study participation 
before reaching Week 264, of whom 21 (75.0%)  subjects completed the protocol-required safety 
follow-up and 7 (25.0%)  subjects did not complete safety follow-up after the last study agent 
administration. Analysis of the PGA response rates during the LTE was based on the  full analysis set. 
The disposition of subjects through  the end of the  reporting period is presented below in Figure 1.

* For both  subjects marked with  an asterisk above, the reason for study agent discontinuation was 
reported incorrectly and should have been documented as LONG TERM  EXTENSION PROTOCOL-
SPECIFIED CRITERIA 9.1.5”.  For one patient  discontinuation was documented as “SITE TERMINATED 
BY SPONSOR and for another the reason for study agent discontinuation was reported incorrectly as 
“OTHER - SUBJECT TURNED 12”.   
CHMP’s comments 
A total of 28 patients were included in the LTE and 100%  of these discontinued study  agent before 
Week 264.  The majority of these (24)  discontinued due to protocol specified criteria 9.1.5: 
• 
The subject turns 12 years of age and resides in a country where marketing authorisation  has 
been granted for ustekinumab treatment of psoriasis in adolescent patients 
•  Marketing authorisation is obtained for ustekinumab for treatment of plaque psoriasis for 
patients ≥6 to <12  years of age in the subject’s country of residence 
•  Marketing authorisation is denied for ustekinumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis for

patients ≥6 to <12  years of age in the subject’s country of residence 
•  A company decision is made to no longer pursue an indication in plaque psoriasis in the 
paediatric population  (≥6 to <12 years of age) in the  subject’s country of residence 
The longest treatment duration was 176 weeks. Based on the  above discontinuation criteria, it is not 
unexpected that  patients who entered the LTE discontinued  from the study before week 264,  however 
the small numbers of patients  evaluated during the LTE, with  only 13 and 3 subjects evaluated at 
Week 152  and Week 176, respectively limits the usefulness of the  observations. 
Baseline  data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were previously presented in 
Mod5.3.5.1/CNTO1275PSO3013/CSR/Sec4.2. 
CHMP’s comments 
Demographic and disease characteristics of subjects in PSO3013 were previously described and 
assessed under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073,  essentially the rapporteur considers the  population studied 
to be representative of the  target treatment population in the  EEA. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
No PK or immunogenicity assessments were performed during the  LTE. 
Efficacy results 
The efficacy evaluations of the LTE consisted of PGA assessments, which occurred every 24 weeks. The 
first LTE efficacy assessment was performed at Week 80. Overall, the  PGA response rates of cleared 
(0) or minimal (1) (Figure 2),  and PGA response rates of cleared (0) (Figure 3)  were maintained from 
Week 80 through  Week 176. Over all visits within  this  period, the proportion of subjects with  a PGA 
score of mild or better (≤2) was ≥95%.

CHMP’s comments 
During the LTE, the  PGA response rates of cleared (0) or minimal (1) were 80%  at week 80, 70%  at 
week 104,  80 % at week 128,  61.5%  at week 152 and 100%  at week 176.  PGA response rates of 
cleared (0) were 64% at week 80,  50% at week 104,  60% at week 128, 54% at  week 152 and 50% at 
week 179)  Over all visits within  this period, the  proportion of subjects with  a PGA score of mild or 
better (≤2) was ≥95%. 
As such, the MAHs position that  PGA response rates of cleared (0)  (Figure 3) were maintained from 
Week 80 through  Week 176 is accepted (in the main study the proportion (95% confidence interval 
[CI]) of subjects who achieved a PGA 0/1 score at  week 12 was 77.3% (62.2%;  88.5%)).  However, 
the small patient numbers in this  LTE (with  13 and 3 subjects evaluated at Week 152 and Week 176, 
respectively) provide a very limited sample size. CDLQI and PSAI, which formed key secondary

endpoints in the main study, were not measured as part of the  LTE. 
Safety  results 
Safety was evaluated based on: 
•  Adverse events 
•  Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) 
•  Vital sign measurements 
• 
Physical examinations 
•  Concomitant medication review 
• 
Injection-site reactions 
•  Allergic reactions 
• 
TB evaluations 
Summaries of AEs and other safety data are presented from Week 56  onwards based on the 28 
subjects enrolled in the LTE  who received at least an injection of ustekinumab at Week 56 (partial or 
complete), ie, the safety analysis set. 
From Week 56 through  the end of the reporting period, 19 (67.9%)  subjects reported 1 or more AEs as 
shown in Table 2. There were no severe AE reported from week 56  to end of reporting period.

Changes in  Haematology 
From Week 56 through  the end of the reporting period, 2 (7.7%)  subjects presented with abnormally 
low lymphocyte levels (defined as <1.5 x 109/L  and at  least 33%  decrease from the baseline value). 
For 1 subject, the abnormally low lymphocyte level was observed approximately 13 weeks after the 
last ustekinumab administration (which  occurred at Week 152). For the  other subject, the  abnormally 
low lymphocyte level was observed from the  Week 104 assessment. This was a transient abnormality 
and subsequently resolved without  interruption  of ustekinumab treatment. 
Changes in  Clinical Chemistry 
From Week 56 through  the end of the reporting period, no subjects presented with  markedly abnormal 
clinical chemistry values. 
Vital Signs and Physical Findings 
From Week 104  through Week 152,  weight, height,  and BMI increased slightly,  consistent with  the age 
of the subjects and expected growth  over this period. 
CHMP’s comments 
The safety profile observed in the LTE  appears consistent with  that observed in the main study and 
generally similar to  that identified  across the clinical development program, though the  limitations of 
the very small patient numbers in the LTE must  be born in mind.  
Given that  both IL-12  and IL-23  mediate inflammation  and modulate cellular immune responses, 
immune suppression affecting host defences against infections and malignancies are potential  risks. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC outlines that ustekinumab may have the  potential to increase the risk of 
infections and reactivate latent infections as well as to increase the risk of malignancy. 
Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE in this  LTE (8 [28.6%]  subjects), followed by 
gastroenteritis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and arthralgia (3 [10.7%]  subjects each.  
The pattern of AEs is agreed to be similar to that in  the main study where 19 (43.2%)  subjects 
reported 1 or more related AEs and the SOC with the  highest incidence of related AEs was Infections

and infestations (12 [27.3%]  subjects), followed by General disorders and administration site 
conditions (6 [13.6%]  subjects). In the main study nasopharyngitis and injection site erythema were 
the most frequently reported related AEs through Week 56 (6 [13.6%]  subjects each), followed by 
pharyngitis (3 [6.8%]  subjects) and tonsillitis  (2  [4.5%] subjects). 
There were no serious infections in the LTE period, though 6  patients did require antimicrobial 
treatment. There are extensive warnings in section 4.4 concerning the  risk of infections, including 
warnings that  patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of 
an infection occur and that  if a patient develops a serious infection, the patient  should be closely 
monitored and STELARA should not be administered until  the infection resolves. 
The MAH is requested to  provide further details in relation to  the AE of skin papilloma.  
The company should confirm whether patients  generally remained within  expected range of their 
baseline centiles for weight, height  and BMI.  
Additional safety data for the population will  be garnered from the ongoing post-marketing study to 
confirm the long-term safety profile and monitor any potential effect on growth and development in 
paediatric patients  aged which  was extended so as to include children aged 6 to  less than 12  years of 
age, in addition to those aged 12 to <18 years of age under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073. 
In response to RSI the MAH  provided additional details in relation to the AE of skin papilloma and 
relating to whether patients  generally remained within  expected range of their baseline centiles for 
weight,  height and BMI.  
It is noted that  the event of skin papilloma of left foot occurred while the  female patient was 
apparently 9 years of age. The patient  is described as having a history of warts and previous treatment 
for psoriasis is listed as being limited to  topical treatments. The patient experienced non-serious, mild 
AR of “viral wart of left foot” which was treated with  monochloroacetic acid and which resolved after 2 
months. The assessment as not related to  study treatment is considered reasonable. 
The MAH provided shift  tables from baseline to  Weeks 52, 104, and 152  for the weight,  height,  and 
BMI centiles for subjects in Study CNTO1275PSO3013.  On review of the  data presented, it can be 
agreed that  no patterns are observed in centile shifts  from baseline in  weight, height,  or BMI at each 
time point  and that  the shifts  observed are in general consistent with  the variations in growth  rates 
expected in a paediatric population  of 6 to  12 year olds. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current Article 46 submission summarizes the efficacy and safety data from the long-term 
extension (LTE)  period of the completed CNTO1275PSO3013 or CADMUS Junior (hereafter referred to 
as PSO3013).  PSO3013 was an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity of ustekinumab in  children aged from ≥6 to <12  years with moderate to  severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis which allowed pediatric subjects who have demonstrated clinical benefit through week 
52 of the main study to continue  receiving ustekinumab. The open-label, single arm design was in 
accordance with the  EMA paediatric investigation plan. 
The results of the main study (through  Week 56) have been submitted  previously 
(EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073),  and formed the basis of the extension of indication  to children aged 6 to 
12 years with  moderate to severe psoriasis.

A total of 28 patients were included in the LTE and 100%  of these discontinued study  agent before 
Week 264.  The majority of these (24)  discontinued due to protocol specified criteria 9.1.5: 
•  The subject turns 12 years of age and resides in a country where marketing authorization  has 
been granted for ustekinumab treatment of psoriasis in adolescent patients 
•  Marketing authorization is obtained for ustekinumab for treatment of plaque psoriasis for 
patients ≥6 to <12  years of age in the subject’s country of residence 
•  Marketing authorization is denied for ustekinumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis for 
patients ≥6 to <12  years of age in the subject’s country of residence 
•  A company decision is made to no longer pursue an indication in plaque psoriasis in the 
paediatric population  (≥6 to <12 years of age) in the  subject’s country of residence 
The longest treatment duration was 176 weeks. Based on the  above discontinuation criteria it is not 
unexpected that  patients who entered the LTE discontinued  from the study before week 264,  however 
the small numbers of patients  evaluated during the LTE, with  only 13 and 3 subjects evaluated at 
Week 152  and Week 176, respectively limits the usefulness of the  observations. 
Demographic and disease characteristics of subjects in PSO3013 were previously described and 
assessed under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073,  essentially the rapporteur considers the  population studied 
to be representative of the  target treatment population in the  EEA. 
During the LTE, the  PGA response rates of cleared (0) or minimal (1) were 80%  at week 80, 70%  at 
week 104,  80 % at week 128,  61.5%  at week 152 and 100%  at week 176.  PGA response rates of 
cleared (0) were 64% at week 80,  50% at week 104,  60% at week 128, 54% at  week 152 and 50% at 
week 179)  Over all visits within  this period, the  proportion of subjects with  a PGA score of mild or 
better (≤2) was ≥95%. 
As such, the MAHs position that  PGA response rates of cleared (0)  (Figure 3) were maintained from 
Week 80 through  Week 176 is accepted (in the main study the proportion (95% confidence interval 
[CI]) of subjects who achieved a PGA 0/1 score at  week 12 was 77.3% (62.2%;  88.5%)).  However, 
the small patient numbers in this  LTE (with  13 and 3 subjects evaluated at Week 152 and Week 176, 
respectively) provide a very limited sample size. CDLQI and PSAI, which formed key secondary 
endpoints in the main study, were not measured as part of the  LTE. 
The safety profile observed in the LTE  appears consistent with  that observed in the main study and 
generally similar to  that identified  across the clinical development program, though the  limitations of 
the very small patient numbers in the LTE must  be born in mind.  
Given that  both IL-12  and IL-23  mediate inflammation  and modulate cellular immune responses, 
immune suppression affecting host defences against infections and malignancies are potential  risks. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC outlines that  ustekinumab may have the  potential to increase the risk of 
infections and reactivate latent infections as well as to increase the risk of malignancy 
Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE in this  LTE (8 [28.6%]  subjects), followed by 
gastroenteritis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and arthralgia (3 [10.7%]  subjects each.  
The pattern of AEs is agreed to be similar to that in  the main study where 19 (43.2%)  subjects 
reported 1 or more related AEs and the SOC with the  highest incidence of related AEs was Infections 
and infestations (12 [27.3%]  subjects), followed by General disorders and administration site 
conditions (6 [13.6%]  subjects). In the main study nasopharyngitis and injection site erythema were 
the most frequently reported related AEs through Week 56 (6 [13.6%]  subjects each), followed by 
pharyngitis (3 [6.8%]  subjects) and tonsillitis  (2  [4.5%] subjects).

There were no serious infections in the LTE period, though 6  patients did require antimicrobial 
treatment. There are extensive warnings in section 4.4 concerning the  risk of infections, including 
warnings that  patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of 
an infection occur and that  if a patient develops a serious infection, the patient  should be closely 
monitored and STELARA should not be administered until  the infection resolves.

The company should confirm whether patients  generally remained within  expected range of their 
baseline centiles for weight, height  and BMI. OC 
Additional safety data for the population will  be garnered from the ongoing post-marketing study to 
confirm the long-term safety profile and to  monitor any potential effect on growth and development in 
paediatric patients  which was extended so as to  include children aged 6 to less than 12 years of age, in 
addition to  those aged 12 to <18  years of age under EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073.

Applicant Response 
The MAH confirms that Study CNTO1275PSO3013  was part of the  agreed EMA paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP; EMEA-C-000311-PIP01-08-M04),  which received a positive opinion 
from the  EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in  compliance with  a PIP, as presented under 
EMEA/H/C/000958/II/0073.  While the  LTE of CNTO1275PSO3013 was part of the overall study 
design, it was not part of the key binding  elements of the PIP. 
CHMP  Comment  
The applicant has clarified that the  LTE of CNTO1275PSO3013 was part of the overall study 
design but was not part of the key binding  elements of the PIP. This clarification is noted in the 
AR.  
Query  is considered to be resolved.  
2.  The MAH is requested to  provide further details in relation to  the AE of skin papilloma. 
Applicant Response 
Available details regarding the adverse event (AE) of skin papilloma reported in Subject 
000050  are provided in Attachment  1. 
Subject 000050  was a 6 year-old female subject who enrolled in the  Study CNTO1275PSO3013 
and received her first dose of open-label ustekinumab on 10 Aug 2017.  The subject’s medical 
history included a history of warts. In April 2019  (day not  specified), the subjected experienced 
a non-serious AE of skin papilloma (verbatim term: viral wart of left  foot) that was mild in 
intensity and considered not  related to study treatment  by the investigator. The event was 
treated with  Vericaust (monochloroacetic acid) and the  event resolved in June 2019  (day not 
specified). No  change to the  subject’s ustekinumab dose was made, and the  subject continued 
in the study. 
CHMP  Comment 
The MAH was requested to  provide additional details in relation to the AE of skin papilloma. It 
is noted that  the event of skin papilloma of left foot occurred while the  female patient was 
apparently 9 years of age. The patient  is described as having a history of warts and previous 
treatment for psoriasis is listed as being limited  to topical treatments. The patient experienced 
nonserious, mild AR of “viral wart of left foot” which  was treated with  monochloroacetic acid 
and which resolved after 2  months. The assessment as not  related to study treatment is 
considered reasonable.  
Response acceptable.  
3.  The company should confirm whether patients  generally remained within  expected range of 
their baseline centiles for weight, height  and BMI. 
Applicant Response 
Child growth dynamic standards were analyzed using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Reference 2007 (5-19  years) SAS macro package. This package covers height-for-age (5-19 
years), weight-for-age (5-10 years), and body mass index (BMI)-for-age (5-19 years) in 
children and adolescents. In children over 10  years of age, weight-for-age is not  considered by

the WHO  to be a good growth indicator as these children are experiencing pubertal growth and 
may appear to  have excess weight, which cannot be distinguished from height in  tall children. 
The WHO recommends using the BMI-for-age indicator for evaluation of appropriate weight  in 
children 10-19 years of age (WHO  2009).  Thus, weight-for-age analyses were only performed 
for subjects up to  10 years of age. 
The subject population in Study CNTO1275PSO3013 included 44  subjects in the  main study; 
these subjects had height  and weight measurements collected at  baseline (Week 0). Of the 44 
subjects in the main study, 40 subjects had height and weight  measurements collected at 
Week 52, and 28  of these subjects entered into  the LTE. Subjects in the LTE discontinued  from 
the study when they met the protocol-specified discontinuation  criteria at any time between 
Week 52 and Week 264;  therefore, the population of subjects in the LTE decreased over time 
and the number of subjects with  height and weight  measurements at Week 104 and Week 152 
are fewer than the numbers at Week 0 and Week 52.  
Shift tables from baseline to Weeks 52, 104,  and 152 for the weight (Attachment  2, 
Attachment 3,  and Attachment  4, respectively), height (Attachment  5, Attachment 6,  and 
Attachment 7,respectively), and BMI (Attachment  8, Attachment 9,  and Attachment  10, 
respectively) centiles for subjects in Study CNTO1275PSO3013 were calculated by every 10% 
centile interval in the Safety Analysis Set.  
In general, subjects in Study CNTO1275PSO3013 remained within  their baseline centiles for 
weight,  height, and BMI at Weeks 52, 104,  and 152. No patterns were observed in centile 
shifts from baseline in weight,  height, or BMI at each time point  and the shifts observed were 
consistent with  the variations in growth rates expected in a paediatic population of 6 to 12  year 
olds.

CHMP  Comment 
The MAH was requested to  confirm whether patients  generally remained within expected range 
of their baseline centiles for weight,  height and BMI. As part of the response, the applicant 
provided shift tables from baseline to Weeks 52,  104, and 152 for the weight,  height, and BMI 
centiles for subjects in Study CNTO1275PSO3013.  While the low numbers of patients  in the 
LTE limit  the ability to draw conclusions of effects on growth, on review of the data presented, 
it can be agreed that no patterns are observed in centile shifts  from baseline in weight,  height, 
or BMI at  each time point  and that  the shifts  observed are in general consistent with  the 
variations in  growth rates expected in  a paediatic population of 6 to 12 year olds.  
Query  resolved.

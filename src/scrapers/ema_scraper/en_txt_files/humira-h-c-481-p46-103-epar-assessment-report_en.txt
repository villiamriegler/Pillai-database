Introduction 
On 31 Oct 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Humira, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
Humira, a human monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor, is approved for the treatment of 
Behçet’s disease in Japan but not in the EU. 
This study was requested by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan and it was only 
conducted in Japan. It was submitted to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended, by submitting data available from patients less than 18 years. 
The MAH stated that Humira 40mg Syringe 0.8mL subcutaneous injection Special investigation in 
patients with intestinal Behcet’s disease P14-152 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
40 mg Syringe 0.8 mL for Subcutaneous Injection was used. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study P14-152 Humira 40mg Syringe 0.8mL subcutaneous injection Special investigation in 
patients with intestinal Behçet’s disease. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objective was to verify the safety and efficacy of Humira in patients with intestinal Behçet's 
disease. 
Study design 
Study P14-152 was a post marketing observational study in which Humira was prescribed for intestinal 
Behçet's disease in routine medical practice as per the Japanese label. It was a single-arm, multi-
center, post marketing cohort study. Patients were observed for 156 weeks at the longest.

Assessor's comment: The Japanese label was not provided, but it is stated in the Result Report that  
“Humira 160 mg is administered at the first dosing by subcutaneous injection and 80 mg is 
administered at 2 weeks after the first dosing. At 4 weeks after the first dosing and thereafter, 40 
mg/dose is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection.” 
It is assumed that this is the dosing used in this study which was post marketing and observational. 
However, the posology for use in children with Behçet’s disease in the Japanese label is unknown, and 
the MAH is asked to provide this information. 
Study population  
Japanese patients with intestinal Behçet’s disease. 
Inclusion Criteria: 
Patients receiving Humira for the treatment of Behçet's disease after the approval of the indication.  
Exclusion Criteria 
Patients included in "Contraindication" in the package insert: 
1. Patients with serious infection (sepsis etc.) [Symptomatic worsening may occur.] 
2. Patients with active tuberculosis [Symptomatic worsening may occur.] 
3. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of HUMIRA 
Patients with a current or past history of demyelinating disorder (multiple sclerosis, etc.) [Symptomatic 
relapse or worsening may occur.] 
Assessor's comment: These are all, except demyelinating disorder, contraindications also in the EU 
label. In addition, moderate to severe heart failure is a contraindication for Humira treatment in the 
EU, but apparently not in Japan. 
Treatments 
Study subjects were treated with Humira per the Japanese label. 
Assessor's comment: See comment above under study design. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A specified use-results survey of HUMIRA 40 mg Syringe 0.8 mL for Subcutaneous Injection was 
performed for the purpose of obtaining the following information in Japanese patients with intestinal 
Bechet’s disease.

•  Relation with the efficacy when anti-adalimumab antibody is measured 
Statistical Methods 
Regarding both the safety and efficacy analyses in this survey, subgroup analysis was performed to 
investigate incidence rates of ADRs and efficacy rates by patient background factors. Subgroup 
analysis was performed employing the Fisher’s exact test for variables on nominal scales and the 
Mann-Whitney u test for variables on ordinal scales (however, the Fisher’s exact test was employed for 
two categorical variables (2 × 2) on ordinal scales). All tests were performed with the two-sided 
significance level of 5%. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The number of registered patients was 473. Among these registered patients, there were 470 patients 
whose data in the survey forms were fixed, excluding 3 patients whose survey forms could not be 
recovered because cooperation of the doctors could not be obtained. 
Among the 470 patients whose data in the survey forms were fixed, there were 6 patients under 15 
years old, 22 patients under 18 years old.

Assessor's comment: It is noted in Table 1 that 4 of the 22 patients actually were 18 years old at 
enrolment. Provided this is correct, 18 subjects were younger than 18 years old. 
Baseline data 
Assessor's comment: No information on baseline data for the paediatric subjects was provided. 
Efficacy results 
Five of the 383 patients included in the efficacy analysis were <15 years of age. The efficacy rate was 
100%, as compared to 84.4% (318/377) among the non-paediatric subjects. 
Assessor's comment: Only efficacy results for the paediatric subjects < 15 years were provided. 
Efficacy of the drug was measured through a final global improvement rating of effect. In all 5 subjects 
the drug was evaluated as “markedly effective” or “effective”. 
Safety results 
Seven of the 22 paediatric patients (31.8%) experienced AEs. 4 paediatric patient (18.18%) 
experienced SAEs.

There was a report of fatal mycosis (aspergillosis) that occurred about 6 months after last dose of 
Humira. The patient was 7 years old at time of death. His medical history, beyond intestinal Behçet's 
disease, included a rare autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder as well as other medical problems. 
On Day 385 of treatment with Humira, the patient developed 'pancytopenia' and based on a bone 
marrow examination a diagnosis of a malignant bone marrow disorder was made. Bone marrow 
transplant was performed on Day 554 of treatment and administration of Humira was discontinued on 
the same day. The reporting physician considered the event of the malignant bone marrow disorder 
attributable to the autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder with no causal relationship to Humira. 
About 6 months after bone marrow transplantation, a CT scan showed multiple nodular shadows 
consistent with Aspergilloma lesions in the lung and he died after 3 days. 
MAH´s conclusion: The findings of this non-interventional study support the conclusion that 
adalimumab is effective and safe intestinal Behçet's disease in Japanese patients. The small number of 
paediatric patients enrolled limits interpretation of the data from this patient population. There were no 
new safety signals observed and the data are consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.

1.3.3.  Rapporteur’s discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided a report on an observational study on patients with Behçet’s disease, conducted 
in Japan, where Humira holds a marketing authorisation for this indication. The reason for submitting 
the study report to the CHMP is that 22 of the 470 subjects were 18 years old or younger, whereof 6 
younger than 15 years. The report was thus provided in accordance with Article 46. 
No information on the doses administered to the children was provided, which is a shortcoming. This 
information is asked for. 
The subjects were treated for a maximum of 152 weeks. However, the exposure times (individual as 
well as mean and median) for the included children have not been provided and is asked for. 
Seven of the paediatric subjects (31.8%) experienced AEs. It is noted that a fatal case of aspergillosis 
occurred in a 7 year old male with a rare autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder and other medical 
problems, who died six months after the discontinuation of Humira. It is agreed that the medical 
history of this patient is a strong confounder. 
In addition to this case, Influenza, pyrexia (2), increased transaminases, increased CRP and oral 
herpes, injection site reaction and Behçet’s disease were reported. These AEs are in line with the 
known safety profile of Humira. 
Four paediatric patients (18.18%) experienced SAEs; these were pyrexia, pyrexia + CRP increased, 
MDS and Behçet’s disease. The incidence rate is not possible to interpret without information on how 
long the included children (< 18 years old) participated in the study. Information on this, as well as the 
AE and SAE rates in children per 100 patient years is asked for. 
Efficacy in children younger than 15 years seems to have been in line with that in older subjects. 
Additional clarifications requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide 
• 
• 
Information on the dose of Humira administered to children in this study. 
exposure times (individual as well as mean and median) for the included children  
•  AE and SAE rate per 100 PTY in the paediatric population. 
 as part of this procedure.. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.  
2.  Assessment of responses from the MAH 
Summary of the MAH´s response 
The following information is provided in response to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) Rapporteur's Assessment Report/Request for Supplementary Information (European 
Medicines Agency [EMA]/91643/2018) on AbbVie's submission of a completed study in subjects with 
intestinal Behcet's disease (Study P14-152) for Humira (adalimumab) on 15 November 2017 
(EMEA/H/C/481 P46 103).

CHMP comment 1 
The Japanese label was not provided, but it is stated in the Result Report that "Humira 160 
mg is administered at the first dosing by subcutaneous injection and 80 mg is administered 
at 2 weeks after the first dosing. At 4 weeks after the first dosing and thereafter, 40 
mg/dose is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection." 
It is assumed that this is the dosing used in this study which was post marketing and 
observational. However, the posology for use in children with Behçet's disease in the 
Japanese label is unknown, and the MAH is asked to provide this information. 
AbbVie Response: 
Upon review of the Rapporteur's comment, it was determined that the dosing described in the Study 
P14-152 Result Report was incorrect due to a translation error. Subjects in Study P14-152 were 
actually dosed per clinical practice following the approved Japanese label, which included an initial dose 
of adalimumab 160 mg by subcutaneous injection and 80 mg administered two weeks after the first 
dose. This was followed by 40 mg administered every other week four weeks after the initial dose (and 
not 40 mg administered once weekly as incorrectly described in the Result Report). Of note, the 
Japanese label does not specify a paediatric dose for Behcet´s disease.  
Additional details regarding the dosing and exposure for the paediatric population is provided below.  
Additional clarifications requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide 
•  Information on the dose of Humira administered to children in this study. 
•  Exposure times (individual as well as mean and median) for the included children. 
•  AE and SAE rate per 100 PTY in the paediatric population as part of this procedure. 
AbbVie Response: 
All pediatric subjects were dosed according to the approved Japanese label, with the exception of the 
two youngest subjects who did not receive the loading dose (one of these subjects received 
adalimumab 40 mg every other week, which was later reduced to 20 mg every other week and one 
subject received 40 mg every other week). 
The overall duration of adalimumab exposure in the paediatric population ranged from 127 days to 
1093 days, with a mean duration of 526.36 days (median: 365 days). The dose and exposure duration 
of adalimumab for each individual paediatric subject in the study population is provided in Table 2.

Table 2 Dose and Exposure Duration of Adalimumab in the Pediatric Population in Study P14-152 
Across the pediatric population (N = 22), a total of 24 adverse events (AEs) and 5 serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were observed, which corresponded to an overall observed rate of 75.44 events (E)/100 
patient-treatment years (PTYs) and 15.72 E/100 PTYs, respectively. Of note, the exposure-adjusted AE 
rate is lower than the rates observed in the global adalimumab paediatric clinical programs, which 
ranged from 239.4 E/100 PTYs in paediatric ulcerative colitis to 558.7 E/100 PTYs in paediatric Crohn's 
disease. The exposure-adjusted SAE rate is within the range observed in the global adalimumab 
pediatric clinical programs (7.4 E/100 PTYs in paediatric psoriasis to 31.6 E/100 PTYs in paediatric 
Crohn's disease).

Subjects, Total PTYs = 31.81 
Rapporteur´s discussion on MAH´s response 
The MAH has provided the requested information on dosing and exposure of the children included in 
this study. All children except 2 were treated with the same dose as adults, meaning a substantial 
exposure. The exposure-adjusted AE and SAE rates have also been presented. These are not 
substantially higher than earlier observed in clinical studies, although it is noted that the comparison 
with paediatric ulcerous colitis made by the MAH is not fully relevant, since this is not yet an approved 
indication. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
In an observational study of Humira in 470 Japanese subjects with Behçet’s disease, 22 subjects were 
18 years old or younger. No new safety signals emerged in this very small population. The safety 
profile seems to be consistent with earlier findings. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

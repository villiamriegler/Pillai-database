previous procedures for JCOVDEN, including summary 
safety reports (SSR) and periodic safety update 
reports (PSUR). Following a regulatory authority 
request, the MAH performed a detailed analysis of all 
available safety data on myocarditis/pericarditis up to 
24th February 2023 as summarised next:   
Most of the spontaneous reports of myocarditis from 
the post-marketing were assessed as Brighton 
Collaboration (BC) Level 4 and Level 5, indicating 
cases providing insufficient information to meet the 
diagnostic certainty (Level 1, 2, or 3), or there were 
clear alternative explanations for the event onset. 
However, some BC Level 1 to 3 cases were reported in 
close temporal association to the vaccine for which 
causality could not be excluded, and in particular, 
several BC Level 2 cases were reported among males 
under 40 years of age. Pericarditis followed a similar 
pattern. 
In the pooled analysis of clinical study data, 0 cases of 
“non-infectious myocarditis” and 2 cases of MedDRA 
High level terms (HLTs) of “non-infectious pericarditis” 
were reported in the JCOVDEN group within 28 days 
post-dose 1; no cases were reported in males below 
40 years of age. No events were reported in the 
placebo group within the same timeframe. 
The MAH has also performed an analysis of the 
available safety data for myocarditis and pericarditis 
using RWE Rapid Cycle Analysis (RWE RCA) methods. 
The MAH used a Self-Controlled Case Series analysis 
design to estimate the risk of occurrence of the AESI 
following the first JCOVDEN administration relative to 
unexposed time (control period) within the same 
Page 2/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
individual, and a Comparative Cohort design to 
estimate risk of occurrence of the predefined AESI 
following the administration of the first JCOVDEN dose 
compared to the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
exposure. The analyses were performed overall and 
stratified by sex and age. Overall, the results indicated 
a high level of certainty of an increased risk of 
myocarditis-pericarditis for males aged 18-39 years 
following the first JCOVDEN dose in the 1-14 day risk 
period (meta-analysis relative risk estimates = 2.3-
5.4) and the 1-28 days risk period (meta-analysis 
relative risk estimates = 1.1-3.3).  
Based on the above, it is agreed with the MAH that 
there is at least a reasonable possibility for a causal 
relationship between occurrence of myocarditis or 
pericarditis after vaccination with JCOVDEN. Available 
data suggest that these conditions can develop within 
just a few days after vaccination, occurred primarily 
within 14 days and have been observed more often in 
males younger than 40 years of age. The available 
data does not allow to estimate the size of the risk 
with any precision, thus a proposed frequency of not 
known is agreed.  
The PI and RMP have been updated accordingly.  The 
benefit risk of JCOVDEN remains unchanged.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information 
on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations 
and having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, 
is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of 
this medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP 
considered that, as all Specific Obligations have either 
been fulfilled or reclassified as Category 3 study in the 
RMP, there are no remaining grounds for the 
marketing authorisations to remain conditional and 
therefore recommends the granting of the MA no 
longer subject to Specific Obligations for JCOVDEN.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmpC to introduce an 
heterologous booster dose of JCOVDEN following 
priming with another adenoviral vector-based 
vaccine based on literature evidence from COV-

SmPC to include safety and immunogenicity data of 
JCOVDEN as heterologous booster dose based on 
data from studies COV-BOOST study.

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to 
include safety and immunogenicity data of JCOVDEN 
as heterologous booster dose based on data from 
DMID 21-0012 study.  
In addition, updated vaccine efficacy by variant has 
been updated based on updated genomic sequencing 
data from study COV3009 and some minor 
corrections have been implemented in in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
This variation has been submitted to introduce an 
heterologous booster with Ad26.COV2.S following 
primary vaccination with another adenoviral vector-
based vaccine and to provide updated  follow-up data 
from studies which were included in variation 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0033. As a consequence, section 
4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmpC have been updated. The 
PL has been updated accordingly.  
Data of the COV-BOOST study were submitted to 
support the heterologous booster with Ad26.COV2.S 
following another adenoviral vector-based primary 
vaccination. This study evaluates safety and 
immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccines given 
as third dose (booster) after primary vaccination with 
adenoviral-vector based or mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.  
The data showed that a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
induces anamnestic humoral responses in individuals 
who completed their primary vaccination schedule 
with 2 doses of ChAdOx1 approximately 77 days 
before the booster vaccination.   
Data from study DMID 21-0012, and independent 
Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial study 
(NCT04889209) that evaluated immunogenicity and 
safety of a booster injection of Ad26.COV2.S  or an 
mRNA vaccine 12 weeks after primary vaccination with

a COVID-19 vaccine were further complemented with 
long-term nAb data for the reference strain D614G, 
nAb data against the Delta and Beta variants, as well 
as CMI data. Ad26.COV2.S induced a booster response 
15 days post boost against the reference strain as well 
as the Beta and the Delta variants in individuals 
primed with a mRNA vaccine who received the booster 
at least 12 weeks after primary vaccination.  
Immunogenicity data against the Omicron BA.1 
variant were available from studies DMID 21-0012 and 
COV2008. COV2008 is a Phase 2 study to evaluate 
immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S when administered as a homologous or 
heterologous booster following primary vaccination 
with an mRNA vaccine. In both studies, GMTs against 
the Omicron BA.1 variant are lower compared to the 
D614G strain, the Delta and the Beta variants. A 
booster dose with Ad26.COV2.S induces a humoral 
immune response in individuals primary vaccinated 
with an mRNA vaccine or with Ad26.COV2.S. Highest 
titers are observed in the groups primary vaccinated 
with an mRNA vaccine. A heterologous boost with 
Ad26.COV2.S results in similar or slightly lower titers 
compared to a homologous mRNA boost. Very low 
titers are obtained after a homologous Ad26.COV2.S 
boost. Data from study DMID 21-0012 also indicates 
that higher titers are obtained after a heterologous 
mRNA boost in Ad26.COV2.S primed individuals. In 
contrast to nAb against the D614G strain, a decrease 
in nAb against the Omicron BA.1 variant is observed 
by Day 91 after a boost with Ad26.COV2.S in all 
groups boosted. 
Page 7/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, the SmPC has been updated with additional 
information on the safety profile of a homologous and 
heterologous booster dose. Heterologous boosting 
after primary vaccination with an adenoviral-vector 
based had an acceptable safety profile. No new safety 
concern was identified after both, homologous and 
heterologous booster.

With the availability of data from final analyses of the 
double-blind phases of Study VAC31518COV3001 and 
the second large double-blind Phase 3 Study 
VAC31518COV3009, available safety data on 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in a randomized, 
placebo-controlled clinical setting data increased 
substantially compared with the amount of safety data 
available at the time of the initial filing.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has 
performed a primary pooled analysis of clinical safety 
data from the double-blind phases of Phase 3 studies 
(VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009), and 
from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies 
(VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002, 
VAC31518COV2001) with Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp 
(18 November 2021) to assess the reactogenicity 
profile and the frequency of adverse events after 
primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 
18 years and older.  
Current identified adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 
the approved SmPC were retained as ADRs in the 
proposed SmPC, but their frequency categories were 
revised. No new ADRs following vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S were identified based on the results of 
the primary pooled analysis compared to the current 
approved safety profile. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
The benefit-risk balance of JCOVDEN remains positive.

Based on a cumulative review of post-marketing data 
and literature on transverse myelitis up to 31st 
September 2021, it was concluded that  there was a 
reasonable possibility to consider transverse myelitis 
as causally related to the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
and therefore, it was added to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The frequency of this event was calculated as 
‘not known’. In addition, considering transverse 
myelitis is a serious condition, albeit occurring very 
rarely, it is considered warranted to add information in 
section 4.4 to raise awareness among prescribers as 
well as vaccinees in case of experiences signs and 
symptoms which may suggest transverse myelitis.  
In addition, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated 
in order to amend the wording on Thrombosis and

Vaccine Janssen, subject to the Specific Obligations 
and Conditions as laid down in Annex II to the opinion. 
SmPC in order to introduce an homologous  booster 
dose (second dose) of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen  
based on interim efficacy, immunogenicity and safety 
results from  different clinical studies including the 
two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 studies COV3001 and COV3009.  A 
contraindication in individuals with a history 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome 
following vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine is 
also included. In addition, an update to introduce an 
heterologous booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen following completion of a primary 
vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine is introduced based on immunogenicity and 
safety interim results from the phase 1/2 study 
DMID 21-0012. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the efficacy data for the 
primary vaccination schedule based on final analysis 
from study COV3001. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Vaccine Janssen may be administered intramuscularly 
at least 2 months after the primary vaccination in 
individuals 18 years of age and older.  
A booster dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (0.5 
mL) may be administered as a heterologous booster 
dose following completion of primary vaccination with 
another approved COVID-19 vaccine. The dosing 
interval for the heterologous booster dose is the same 
as that authorised for a booster dose of the vaccine 
used for primary vaccination.  
Individuals who have experienced thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following 
vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine should not 
receive COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen 
The risk of very rare events (such as coagulation 
disorders including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
syndrome, CLS and GBS) after a booster dose of 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen has not yet been 
characterised.  
Efficacy of two-doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen 
administered 2 months apart 
A final analysis (cut-off date 25 June 2021) of a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 study (COV3009) was conducted to 
assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of 2 
Page 19/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen administered with 
a 56-day interval. 
In total, 14492 individuals were included in the per-
protocol efficacy population (7484 individuals received 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and 7008 individuals 
received placebo). 
Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infections at 
least 14 days after second vaccination was 75.2% 
(95% CI: 54.6; 87.3). 
Immunogenicity of a booster dose (second dose) 
following primary vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen 
In a Phase 2 Study (COV2001), individuals 18 through 
55 years of age and 65 years and older received a 
booster dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen 
approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination. 
Immunogenicity data are available from 39 
individuals, of whom 15 were 65 years of age and 
older. Neutralising antibody and binding antibody 
increases against the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain 
were also observed in studies COV1001, COV1002 and 
COV2001 in a limited number of study participants 
after a boost given at 2, 3 and 6 months, when 
compared to pre-boost values. Overall, the increases 
of GMTs pre-boost to 1-month post-boost ranged from 
1.5 to 4.4 fold for neutralising antibodies, and from 
2.5 to 5.8 fold for binding antibodies. A 2-fold 
decrease in antibody levels was observed 4 months 
following 2-month booster dose, compared to 1 month 
following 2-month booster dose. Antibody levels were 
still higher than antibody levels following a single-dose 
at a similar timepoint. These data support the 
Page 20/33 
 
 
 
 
 
administration of a booster dose when administered at 
an interval of 2 months or longer after primary 
vaccination. 
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary 
vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
An independent Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial 
(NCT04889209) conducted in the United States 
evaluated a heterologous booster dose of the COVID-
19 Vaccine Janssen. Due to the limited sample size, 
differences observed are only descriptive. In this 
study, adults who had completed primary vaccination 
with a Spikevax 2-dose series (N=151), a COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen single-dose (N=156), or a Comirnaty 
2-dose series (N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to 
enrollment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-
2 infection were randomised 1:1:1 to receive a 
booster dose of one of three vaccines: Spikevax, 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen or Comirnaty. Neutralising 
antibody titres were assessed on Day 1 prior to 
administration of the booster dose and on Day 15 and 
Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster response to 
the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was demonstrated 
regardless of primary vaccination. The antibody level 
14 days after a heterologous boost by COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen is lower than after a homologous 
boost by a licensed mRNA vaccine while after 1 
month, neutralising antibody titers are roughly similar 
between both regimens. Data indicate the homologous 
regimen with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen induces lower 
antibody responses compared to heterologous 
boosting with a licensed mRNA vaccine. The clinical 
relevance of this is unknown. Only short-term 
Page 21/33 
 
 
 
 
 
immunogenicity data are available, long-term 
protection and immunological memory are currently 
unknown.

Based on a cumulative review of post-marketing data 
on anxiety related reactions, including dizziness, it 
was concluded there was a reasonable possibility to 
consider dizziness as causally related to the COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen, and therefore, it was added to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. The frequency of this event 
was calculated as ‘uncommon’ based on clinical data 
from study VAC31518COV3001. 
ITP was added to section 4.8 following a review of the 
available post-marketing and clinical trial data. In 
addition,  taking case reviews into account, and 
particularly due to the severity of some cases 
reported, as well as limited post-marketing and 
literature data showing significant decrease in platelet 
values in patients with a prior medical history of ITP 
following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 
vaccine, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC is 
added. 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
(DHPC) is considered necessary in order to 
communicate on the new recommendations in relation 
to ITP; namely that Healthcare professionals (HCPs) 1. 
should assess an individual’s relevant medical history 
prior to administering COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and 
discuss the risks and benefits of developing low 
platelet levels before administering the vaccine, 
2.should be alert to signs and symptoms of ITP, such 
as spontaneous bleeding, bruising or petechiae and 3. 
are recommended to monitor platelet levels in 
individuals with a history of ITP following vaccination 
with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.

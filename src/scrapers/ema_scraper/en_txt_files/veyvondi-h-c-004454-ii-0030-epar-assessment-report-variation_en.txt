The purpose of this application is to seek approval for the expanded use of vonicog alfa (VEYVONDI) for 
prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults with severe von 
Willebrand disease (VWD). 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a loss or defective function of 
von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein, ranging in molecular weight from 
500 to >20,000 kDa, normally found in plasma, alpha-granules of platelets and storage granules of 
endothelial cells, known as the Weibel-Palade bodies. VWF plays a key role in primary haemostasis, 
facilitating platelet adhesion to the sub-endothelium at sites of vascular injury, one of the key functions in 
primary haemostasis, thereby initiating clot formation. Additionally, VWF acts as a carrier molecule for 
Factor VIII (FVIII), an essential cofactor of secondary haemostasis that leads to fibrin clot formation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 6/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VWD represents the most common inherited human bleeding disorder with a prevalence of 0.6-1.3%. 
VWD is a heterogeneous disease and classified into three different types. Type 1 VWD (accounting for 70 
to 80% of cases), is characterized by a mild or moderate quantitative deficiency of VWF, whereas type 2 
summarizes different forms of qualitative defects known to affect function rather than the plasma levels 
of VWF antigen. Type 3 von Willebrand’s disease is rare (<5% of cases, approx. 1 in 1 million people) and 
represents is the most severe form caused by an almost complete loss of circulating VWF. 
Clinical presentation of VWD shows strong variations among patients and critically depends on the 
amount and functionality of residual VWF, as well as the patient’s age and sex. The main burden of the 
disease results from bleeding symptoms which are primarily caused by defective platelet adhesion and 
aggregation in mucosa-associated bleedings like for instance epistaxis or menorrhagia. In general, 
bleeding symptoms are more severe in type 2 and type 3 than in type 1 VWD. Disease subtypes with 
markedly reduced FVIII levels (type 2N and type 3 VWD) are further complicated by ‘‘haemophilia-type’’ 
joint and deep subcutaneous tissue bleeds, eventually leading to long-term damages and disabilities. The 
majority of patients (60-80%) experience excessive bleeding after surgery or dental extractions. A well-
known, serious, and possibly life-threatening complication affecting patients with severe disease 
phenotypes is gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from angiodysplasia. 
Treatment of VWD largely depends on the type and severity of the disease. The basic principle of 
treatment is to support haemostasis which can be achieved by chemical agents like tranexamic acid or 
aminocaproic acid or by an iatrogenic correction of the reduced plasma VWF activity. An increase of 
plasma VWF levels can be achieved by desmopressin (DDAVP) which promotes its release from 
endogenous stores. When DDAVP treatment alone is ineffective or contra-indicated, endogenous VWF can 
be replaced by infusion of VWF containing medicinal products. Currently available concentrates are 
plasma-derived and contain different amounts and ratios of VWF and FVIII. Besides the problem of 
varying composition and overall plasma donor availability, drawbacks of plasma-derived VWF/FVIII 
products are given by an at least theoretical risk of pathogen transmission as well as the presence of 
extraneous plasma proteins which may trigger allergic responses. A serious although rare complication of 
VWF replacement therapy is the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) which have been shown to 
develop in 5-10% of type 3 VWD patients and might result in treatment failure or trigger anaphylaxis with 
subsequent exposures.  
The mainstay of treatment is on-demand to control spontaneous bleeding or to prevent excessive 
bleeding during surgical procedures. However, a subset of patients with severe VWD (i.e. suffering from 
frequent and severe BEs) may benefit from long-term prophylactic treatment as also acknowledged by 
the wording in section 4.1 of the Core SmPC for human plasma derived VWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02) 
(“Prevention and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in von Willebrand disease (VWD), when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contra-indicated”) and the recently published 
ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guideline on the management of VWD (Connell et al. 2021). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
With this application, the MAH applied for an extension of indication for VEYVONDI to include prophylactic 
treatment in adults with severe VWD to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes as follows: 
VEYVONDI is indicated in adults (age 18 and older) with von Willebrand Disease (VWD), when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated for the 
- Treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding  
- Prevention of surgical bleeding 
- Prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Vonicog alfa (also known as BAX111, SHP677, TAK-577, and rVWF) is a purified recombinant VWF in the 
drug class of blood coagulation factors, and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical System classification 
code is B02BD10.  
Vonicog alfa is authorised for marketing in the United States (US), Canada, and Japan (under the trade 
name VONVENDI), and the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Australia (under the trade 
name VEYVONDI), and is indicated for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding events as well as 
perioperative management of bleeding in adults (age 18 years and older) diagnosed with VWD. In 
addition, vonicog alfa is approved in the US for routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding 
events in adult patients with severe type 3 VWD receiving on-demand therapy; and in Japan for 
prophylactic treatment for suppression of bleeding tendency in adults with VWD. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
On 22 May 2014, the Marketing Authorisation holder (MAH) obtained CHMP protocol assistance 
(EMEA/H/SA/1378/2/FU/1/2014/PA) on the design of the Phase 3 Study 071301 for the prophylactic use 
of rVWF to prevent or reduce the frequency of BEs in patients with VWD. According to the MAH, the final 
design of Study 071301 including inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary endpoint, secondary outcomes, 
observation time, and the statistical plan has been aligned with this advice. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
As requested during the EMA pre-submission meeting held on 29 June 2022, the MAH provided the GCP 
inspection reports already conducted in relation to study 071301 from both the FDA (1 sponsor report 
and 3 site inspection reports) and PMDA (1 site inspection report). None of the previous inspections 
revealed major issues requiring further regulatory actions.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
VEYVONDI contains a naturally occurring protein as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which due to its 
nature is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, VEYVONDI is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment and the absence of ERA studies is considered justified. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Vonicog alfa is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 071301 
For a detailed description of study 071301, reference is made to section 2.4.1 below. 
During Study 071301, two PK/PD assessments using a full PK sampling collection scheme were 
conducted. For Prior OD (on-demand) subjects, an initial PK assessment and a steady-state PK 
assessment at the end of studywere performed. The rVWF infusion for the initial PK assessment for Prior 
OD subjects only was to be administered during the baseline visit, which had to take place within 42 days 
after the completion of screening procedures and upon confirmation of eligibility. A washout period of at 
least 5 days since the last pre-study VWF dose was required prior to infusion of rVWF for PK assessment. 
Subjects received 50 ±5 IU/kg rVWF for the initial PK assessment. Blood samples were to be drawn 
within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post-infusion (15, 30, and 60 [±5] minutes; 3, 6, 
12, and 24 [±0.5] hours; and 30, 48, 72, and 96 [±2] hours). 
For patients who had been receiving prophylactic treatment with a plasma-derived VWF “Switch 
subjects”, 2 steady state PK assessments were performed. The first PK assessment was performed 
shortly after reaching steady state, which was expected to be around prophylactic dose #5 or #6 
following the 1st prophylactic dose received, for majority of the subjects, and a second PK assessment 
was performed at the EOS; however, one Switch subject had the initial PK assessment done at the first 
dose. 
For steady state PK assessments (second PK assessment for all subjects and initial PK assessment for 
Switch subjects), the rVWF dose was to be given for prophylaxis at the time, and blood samples were be 
drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post-infusion (15, 30, and 60 [±5] minutes; 
3, 6, 12, and 24 [±0.5] hours; and 30, 48, 72, and 96 [±2] hours) as long as it did not interfere with 
subject’s scheduled regular prophylactic dosing regimen, otherwise the sampling at 96 ±2 hours was to 
be omitted, but it was critical that the assessments were at the same partial interval, thereby including 
the same number of sampling timepoints for the 1st and 2nd PK assessments for an individual Switch 
subject. The final sample for PK assessment had to be drawn before the next scheduled prophylactic dose 
was administered. 
PK/PD parameters were derived using noncompartmental methods using actual elapsed time from the 
start of infusion rather than scheduled sampling times, wherever possible, and actual infusion duration. 
In addition, pre-dose and 30-minute post-dose samples were taken at Months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 to assess 
incremental recovery (IR, postdose value minus pre-dose value divided by rVWF dose) of PK and PD 
measures over time. The EOS IR information was obtained from the PK assessment at the end of study 
using Cmax samples. 
Results: 
In the PK FAS, 22 subjects (12 Prior OD subjects and 10 Switch subjects) completed the initial PK/PD 
assessments. Among these subjects, 9 Prior OD subjects who completed the study had a full PK 
assessment at the EOS; and 7 out of 8 Switch subjects who completed the study had a full PK 
assessment at the EOS (1 subject completed the study but did not have a PK assessment at the EOS). 
The Prior OD and Switch groups’ plasma concentration–time profiles for VWF:RCo at the initial and 
second/final (Month 12) assessment are shown in the Figure below. Following the initial PK vonicog alfa 
dose, VWF:RCo peaked at 0.25 hours with 77.3 IU/kg (median) and 77.01 (23.04) IU/kg (mean 
[standard deviation (SD)]) for Prior OD subjects, and at 0.5 hours with 73.0 IU/kg (median) and 75.79 
(48.28) IU/kg (mean [SD]) for Switch subjects, which then declined and was below the lower limit of 
quantification at 48 hours and beyond for both groups. Following the final EOS PK vonicog alfa dose, the 
Assessment report

concentration-time profiles followed a similar trend, with median VWF:RCo peaks at 0.25 hours with 
89.40 IU/kg (median) and 89.18 (43.32) IU/kg (mean [SD]) for Prior OD subjects. The VWF:RCo peak 
concentration for Switch subjects at the EOS analysis occurred at 0.25 hours for the mean (SD), with 
101.11 (44.85) IU/kg, and at 0.5 hours for the median, with 95.30 IU/kg.

For the final PK assessment, all 9 Prior OD subjects were on the twice weekly regimen and received vonicog alfa doses 
between 41 and 56 IU/kg. 
For the initial and final PK assessments, the Switch subjects received vonicog alfa doses ranging from 24 to 75 IU/kg and 
from 24 to 78 IU/kg, respectively. At the initial assessment, Switch subjects were taking vonicog alfa doses twice weekly 
(8 of 10 subjects), once a week (1 subject), and 3 times a week (1 subject). 
Not all subjects reached Cmax at the same time after the dose; therefore, the PK parameters and the mean concentration-
time curves may appear to be mismatched even though both are correct. 
Mean values are arithmetic means.

a  For these parameters, subject was removed from the originally defined model due to estimation issue.

The absence of statistically significant differences between the initial and EOS PK assessments for any of 
the VWF:RCo PK parameters analysed (geometric LS means) supports the MAH’s notion of temporal 
consistency of vonicog alfa PK properties. 
Considering the differences in sample sizes (with a lower number of available PK assessments at EOS) 
and to better address the issue of intra-subject consistency of PK parameters over time, the MAH was 
requested to provide summary tables for final versus initial PK parameters for VWF:RCo and FVIII:C 
considering only the subset of subjects with available PK data from both PK visits (baseline and EOS). 
Together, the newly provided data further support the MAH’s claim of a lack of statistically significant 
differences in PK properties of vonicog alfa during long-term prophylactic treatment. 
Median VWF:RCo IR for both groups was similar and relatively constant over the assessment time course. 
The medians ranged from 1.276 (prophylaxis visit) to 1.793 (Month 9) for the Prior OD subjects and from 
1.280 (prophylaxis visit) to 1.718 (Month 6) for Switch subjects.

Table 7. Summary of VWF:RCo Incremental Recovery 
Study SHP677-304 
For a detailed description of the continuation study SHP677-304, reference is made to section 2.4.1 
below.  
Study SHP677-304 is still ongoing. The present submission is supported by an interim analysis performed 
with a data cut-off of 30 Jun 2022. The interim analysis included PK data for a total of 11 subjects who 
completed the parent study 071301 and continued prophylactic treatment in study SHP677-304. 
PK data in the interim analysis are limited to an analysis of incremental recovery (IR) of vonicog alfa for 
subjects receiving prophylaxis. IR was determined for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB for the initial 
continuation study prophylaxis visit, as well as for follow-up visits at Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12.  
As noted by the MAH, the IR at 30 minutes postdose was generally >1 and consistent over time for the 
majority of subjects for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB, which demonstrates sustainable exposure for 
continued prophylactic dosing of vonicog alfa. Additionally, the ranges of the mean values of IR over time 
from Month 1 to Month 12 for VWF:RCo were consistent with values observed in the parent study.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Vonicog alfa is a recombinantly produced VWF intended to replace endogenous VWF. VWF functions at 
two steps of haemostasis. First, VWF facilitates primary haemostasis by its ability to associate to 
subendothelial collagen as well as platelet adhesion receptor GP1. This effect occurs immediately and is 
known to depend to a large extent on the degree of VWF multimerisation. In addition, VWF indirectly 
promotes secondary haemostasis by protecting the critical coagulation factor VIII from degradation. 
Because of this, administration of vonicog alfa restores the FVIII:C level to normal as a secondary effect. 
As noted in section 5.1 of the currently approved SmPC, after administration of vonicog alfa, the FVIII:C 
level rises above 40% within 6 hours and peaks within 24 hours in the majority of patients.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Both prophylaxis studies (Study 071301 and SHP677-304) included assessments of plasma FVIII activity 
as a measure of vonicog alfa PD. 
Study 071301 
Factor VIII:C 
The Prior OD and Switch groups’ plasma concentration–time profiles for FVIII activity at the initial and 
second/final (Month 12) assessment are shown in the Figure below. For Prior OD subjects, the mean (SD) 
and median pre-dose concentrations of FVIII:C for the initial PK assessment was 8.8 (14.9) and 2.0 
IU/dL, respectively. Following the initial vonicog alfa dose (which ranged from 44.78 to 54.73 IU/kg), 
mean (SD) and median FVIII:C peaked at 24 hours at 97.4 (23.6) and 91.5 IU/dL, respectively, which 
then declined over time to a mean (SD) and median of 28.3 (26.6) and 18.0 IU/dL, respectively, by 96 
hours. The initial pre-dose FVIII:C concentrations for Switch subjects were a mean (SD) and median of 
30.0 (21.6) and 24.0 IU/dL, respectively. The PD concentration over time curve for Switch subjects 
followed a similar trend as the Prior OD subjects; after the initial vonicog alfa dose (range of 24.38 IU/kg 
to 74.48 IU/kg), mean (SD) and median FVIII:C peaked at 30 and 24 hours, respectively, at 80.2 (25.4) 
and 85.5 IU/dL, respectively, which then declined over time to a mean (SD) and median of 17.7 (16.1) 
and 13.0 IU/dL, respectively, by 96 hours.

Upon request, the MAH presented a summary of cases of high pre-dose FVIII variability in relation to the 
preceding doses of vonicog alfa ± ADVATE that contributed to the observed pre-dose FVIII:C. Except for 
one case, all notable values could be reasonably explained by either the timing or the amount of 
preceding doses of vonicog alfa ± ADVATE.

Statistical difference in Cmax/D was observed but can be explained by the impact of two subjects who 
contributed non-reliable Cmax estimates due to unavailable FVIII:C levels beyond the 1-hour time point 
of assessment. The MAH confirmed that if only reliable estimates of Cmax were considered, no significant 
changes between the two PK visits were found.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
To support prophylactic dosage (dose and dosing interval) of vonicog alfa in adult subjects with VWD, 
existing population PK and PK/PD models (previously established for clinical studies conducted in adult 
subjects with VWD for OD treatment and perioperative management of bleeding (i.e. Studies 070701, 
071001, and 071101)) were updated by including the data collected in the prophylaxis studies 071301 
and SHP677-304 (IA). In the population PK model, VWF:RCo was used to characterise the PK properties 
of VWF. In addition, the PK/PD relationship was assessed by linking VWF activity to FVIII activity. 
Population PK 
A total of 100 unique subjects with at least 1 measurable value of VWF:RCo had PK samples collected and 
were included in the population PK analysis. The population included a total of 50 (50.0%) male and 50 
(50.0%) female subjects. The population included a total of 5 (5.0%) elderly subjects (≥65 years). The 
population included a total of 20 (20.0%) subjects with VWD Type 1 or 2 and 80 (80.0%) subjects with 
VWD Type 3. A total of 61 (61.0%) subjects received vonicog alfa, while a total of 31 (31.0%) subjects 
received vonicog alfa/ADVATE and a total of 8 (8.0%) subjects received pdVWF:pdFVIII. The population 
included a total of 86 (86.0%) subjects with normal renal function, 13 (13.0%) subjects with mild renal 
impairment, and 1 (1.0%) subject with moderate renal impairment. The median (range) age and body 
weight in the PK population were 36.0 years (18.0 to 77.0 years) and 72.5 kg (43.8 to 145 kg), 
respectively. 
Results 
Key findings of the population PK analyses are summarised as follows: 
The PK of VWF:RCo was described by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination and baseline 
(endogenous) levels of VWF. For a typical adult subject with VWD type 3 (70 kg, 35 years, Study 071001) 
receiving vonicog alfa, the CL and Vc of VWF:RCo were 1.99 dL/h and 37.4 dL, respectively. The total 
volume of distribution of VWF:RCo was 53.0 dL, which is consistent with total blood volume in a 70-kg 
subject (52 dL), suggesting that distribution was limited to the vascular space. For a typical adult patient, 
the half-life of VWF:RCo associated with the distribution (t1/2α)and elimination (t1/2β) phases were 1.90 
and 19.4 h, respectively 
Covariate analyses showed that the CL of VWF:RCo was dependent on body weight, age, the type of 
product (vonicog alfa versus pdVWF:pdFVIII), and study (prophylaxis). The exponent for the effect of 
body weight on CL was 0.611 [ie, (WT/70)0.611], suggesting a faster CL of VWF:RCo in subjects with 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 20/71 
 
 
 
 
 
higher body weight. The exponent for the effect of age on CL was -0.112 [i.e. (age/35) -0.112]. These 
results suggest a slower CL of VWF:RCo in older subjects when considering subjects with similar body 
weight. The CL of VWF:RCo for the pdVWF:pdFVIII product was 59% faster than the CL of vonicog alfa in 
a prophylaxis setting. For a typical adult patient with type 3 VWD receiving pdVWF:pdFVIII, the t1/2 of 
VWF:RCo associated with the distribution (t1/2α) and elimination (t1/2β) phases were 1.84 and 12.6 hours, 
respectively. Subjects enrolled in the prophylaxis and continuation studies (071301 and SHP677-304) 
presented a CL of VWF:RCo 57% higher relative to that in Study 071001. 
Based on the covariate analyses, race, sex, VWD type (VWD type 1-2 versus 3), and coadministration 
with rFVIII, did not affect the CL of VWF:RCo. Clearance and Vc were dose-independent for a dose range 
of 2.0 to 80 IU/kg. The effect of spontaneous bleeding on the CL and Vc of VWF:RCo in the OD study 
(Study 071001) and prophylaxis study (Study 071301), as well as both studies combined, was not 
statistically significant. 
Population PK/PD 
A PK/PD model was developed where the FVIII PD response was described using an indirect response 
model in which the degradation of FVIII (Kout) was inhibited by the PK model-predicted activity of 
VWF:RCo in a concentration-dependent manner. 
A total of 94 subjects with at least 1 measurable value of FVIII were included in the population PK/PD 
analysis (Studies 070701, 071001, 071101, and 071301). Of the 94 subjects included in the PK/PD 
analysis, 16 (17.0%) presented with VWD Type 1-2 and 78 (83.0%) presented with VWD Type 3 
Results: 
- 
The final PK/PD model shows that the Kout was 3.85 L/h; the volume of distribution of FVIII 
(VFVIII) (34.0 dL), as part of the PK/PD model, was consistent with the volume of distribution of 
VWF:RCo estimated with the population PK model (37.4 dL). Likewise, the exponent for the effect 
of body weight on the volume of distribution of FVIII (i.e. 0.605) was consistent with the 
exponent for the effect of body weight of VWF:RCo estimated with the population PK model (i.e. 
0.579). 
-  Based on Hill coefficient values from the model (indicating the steepness of the response slope), 
the PK/PD relationship in subjects with VWD type 3 (Hill=2.15) is suggested to be relatively steep 
compared with subjects with type 1-2, probably due to very low endogenous levels of VWF:RCo in 
subjects with type 3 and a rapid effect on FVIII observed soon after intravenous administration of 
vonicog alfa. 
-  Covariate testing showed that the study effect of prophylaxis was statistically significant on the 
mean rate constant of degradation of FVIII (Kout) and maximum inhibitory effect (Imax). The effect 
of bleeding and disease type on Kout, Imax were not statistically significant. 
-  At steady state, PK/PD parameters using simulated concentrations in Switch subjects were similar 
to those observed in Prior OD subjects. 
Population PK/PD simulations (see Figure 3 below) suggest that following twice-weekly dosing with 50 
IU/kg vonicog alfa, the FVIII:C in patients with type 3 at steady state is expected to be above 40 IU/dL 
for an average of 5.29 days over a weekly interval (76% of weekly time). As a comparison, the 
population PK/PD model analyses suggest that following twice-weekly dosing with pdVWF:pdFVIII, the 
FVIII:C in patients with type 3 is expected to be above 40 IU/dL for an average of 3.70 days over a 
weekly interval (53% of weekly time). Data for patients with type 1-2 are scarce, but modelling analyses 
suggest that patients with type 1-2 receiving vonicog alfa either once or twice weekly would, on average, 
have FVIII:C levels above 40 IU/dL over the 7 days of weekly time following both twice-weekly and once-
weekly dosing.

The MAH confirmed that the clearance of VWF:RCo in the prophylaxis studies was higher than in previous 
trials and hypothesises that this difference may be attributed to differences in blood sample preparations 
and/or bioanalytical assays between the different studies. The observed differences in Kout and Imax in 
turn, were reasonably explained as a direct consequence of higher VWF:RCo clearance (resulting in lower 
levels of activity). Even though the MAH’s explanation remains hypothetical, it is agreed that the 
observed impact of treatment (on-demand vs. prophylaxis) on VWF:RCo clearance is reasonably 
explained by a likely impact of methodological between-study differences.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In Study 071301, non-compartmental analyses using rich samples were used to evaluate PK/PD 
properties of vonicog alfa after single and multiple doses under long-term prophylaxis. In Study SHP677-
304, PK/PD analyses were limited to assessments of IR and pre-dose plasma FVIII activity. In addition to 
the PK/PD data observed in the clinical studies, population PK and PK/PD modelling was used to provide 
additional support for the adequacy of the proposed prophylactic dosing regimen. 
Results obtained in the single dose PK/PD assessment in Prior OD subjects (Cmax 75.7 IU/dL, Tmax 0.54 
hours, t1/2 15.98 hours, AUC0-inf 1178 IU·h/dL) were generally consistent with the known PK/PD behaviour 
of vonicog alfa as reflected in its EPAR and in sections 5.1 and 5.2 of its currently approved SmPC. With 
regards to the employed methodology, the spacing of sampling times, the use of pre-infusion 
concentration corrections and a washout period covering >4 half-times of VWF and FVIII for the first 
assessment in Prior OD subjects are acknowledged. 
Additional steady state PK/PD assessments performed during prophylactic treatment (early after 
treatment initiation and at EOS in Switch subjects and at EOS in Prior OD subjects) essentially support 
the notion of a stable / consistent PK/PD behaviour of vonicog alfa over the duration of treatment, not 
only with regard to VWF:RCo PK but also with regard to the vonicog alfa-mediated upregulation of plasma 
FVIII activity with largely comparable peak levels (mean values ranging from 75.7 IU/dL to 104.1 dL 
reached approximately 24 hours after administration) not raising concerns regarding a possible exceeding 
of safety relevant thresholds. Furthermore, a comparison of PK assessments performed before and after 
initiation of prophylactic treatment confirms a statistically significant approximately 5-fold increase in 
FVIII:C levels from 3.83 IU/dL at baseline to 18.7 IU/dL under prophylaxis (geometric least squares 
means). 
However, given a significant number of early discontinuations from study 071301, the actual degree of 
generalisability of the steady state PK data obtained at EOS remains debatable. In fact, results from this 
assessment were only available for 9 of the 13 Prior OD and 7 of the 10 Switch subjects, raising concerns 
with regards to a potential enrichment of favourable responders. Importantly, similar concerns apply to 
the Switch group of the study, which is considered likely to be enriched for subjects with a favourable 
response to prophylactic treatment. 
In general (and as expected), the PK/PD data obtained in study 071301 show a high degree of 
interindividual heterogeneity and remain difficult to interpret in the context of the small sample size. 
However, in view of the available data, general conclusions of a therapy-induced increase in steady-state 
plasma FVIII:C levels upon initiation of prophylactic treatment and overall consistency of the PK/PD 
behaviour of vonicog alfa under the proposed prophylactic dosing regimen (without safety relevant 
increases in plasma FVIII:C levels) are considered sufficiently well-founded.  
In view of the available PK/PD data obtained in Study 071301, the additionally presented model-based 
analyses are viewed as merely supportive. However, the population PK model appears sufficiently 
validated and by predicting plasma FVIII:C levels in type 3 VWD above 40 IU/dL for an average of 5.29 
days (i.e. 76% of weekly time), PK/PD simulations provide further support for the proposed initiation of 
prophylactic treatment using individual doses of 40-60 IU/kg vonicog alfa and a BIW regimen. This is also 
reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Outcomes of PK/PD assessments performed in the prophylaxis studies 071301 and SHP677-304 together 
with supportive evidence from population PK/PD modelling support the proposed posology for an initiation 
of prophylactic treatment (i.e. BIW 40-60 IU/kg).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
Efficacy of prophylaxis with vonicog alfa in VWD was investigated in the completed Phase 3 clinical study 
071301 and the ongoing long-term extension study SHP677-304. In addition, for subjects who completed 
Study 071301 and entered Study SHP677-304, the MAH performed an integrated analysis of efficacy data 
from the day of the first dose of prophylactic treatment in Study 071301 through the data cut-off date 
(30 Jun 2022) in Study SHP677-304. 
Study 071301: A Prospective, Phase 3, Open-label, International Multicenter 
Study on Efficacy and Safety of Prophylaxis with rVWF in Severe von 
Willebrand Disease 
Methods 
Study 071301 was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, international, multicenter 
(32 sites in 9 countries) Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic treatment with 
vonicog alfa in adult patients with severe VWD. The study included 2 groups of study subjects: 
• 
• 
“Prior OD subjects”: Subjects who had been receiving OD (on-demand) treatment with a VWF 
product prior to Study 071301 and had ≥3 documented spontaneous bleeds (not including 
menorrhagia) requiring VWF treatment during the 12 months prior to Study 071301. 
“pdVWF Switch subjects” (referred to as “Switch subjects”): Subjects who had been receiving 
prophylactic treatment with a plasma-derived VWF (pdVWF) for at least 12 months prior to Study 
071301. 
The observation period for historical BEs was the 365 days prior to the first prophylactic dose of vonicog 
alfa. 
The study aimed at an enrolment of ≥8 subjects into each of the 2 groups, with a total of at least 5 
subjects with Type 3 VWD to be followed for 12 months. Both, Prior OD and Switch subjects were to 
receive prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa for a 12-month period (longer for some subjects, 
depending on when the continuation study was initiated at the subjects’ study sites). 
During prophylactic treatment, any BEs (bleeding episodes) requiring rVWF therapy were to be treated 
with rVWF with or without ADVATE (recombinant Factor VIII [rFVIII], octocog alfa). In addition, subjects 
who required surgery or dental procedures were treated with investigational product (i.e. rVWF with or 
without ADVATE) to manage peri-operative bleeding. Efficacy and safety were assessed throughout the 
study. PK/PD were assessed twice with an initial assessment before the start of prophylactic rVWF 
treatment for Prior OD subjects and after the first 5 to 6 prophylactic rVWF doses (approximately after 11 
days on rVWF prophylaxis) for Switch subjects. For both groups, a second or final PK/PD assessment was 
performed at study completion (last rVWF dose). After completing the study, subjects could continue into 
the Continuation Study SHP677-304, during which they could continue receiving prophylactic rVWF 
treatment or switch to only on-demand rVWF therapy.

Figure 4. Study 071301 Design 
Study participants 
Subjects had to be adults (≥18 years of age, BMI ≥15 but <40 kg/m2) with severe VWD (baseline VWF 
Ristocetin Cofactor activity [VWF:RCo] <20 IU/dL) and a history of BEs which required either OD or 
prophylactic VWF substitution treatment. Subjects with Type 2N VWD were formally excluded. 
Prior OD subjects required a history of ≥3 documented spontaneous bleeds (not including menorrhagia) 
requiring VWF treatment during the past 12 months. Switch subjects had to receive prophylactic 
treatment with a pdVWF product for no less than 12 months prior to screening. Of note, subjects 
receiving prophylactic treatment with more than 5 infusions or a weekly dose exceeding 240 IU/kg at the 
time of screening were formally excluded. 
Enrollment was restricted to subjects with available records to reliably evaluate type, frequency, and 
treatment of bleeding episodes during at least 12 months preceding enrollment. Availability of dosing and 
factor consumption during 12 months (up to 24 months) of treatment prior to enrollment was required for 
pdVWF Switch subjects and was desired (but not a requirement) for Prior OD subjects. 
Treatments 
Prophylaxis 
Prior OD subjects started rVWF prophylactic treatment with the standard prophylactic dose within the 
range of 50 ±10 IU/kg rVWF per infusion with infusions given twice per week. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 25/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For Switch subjects, the total weekly dose (IU/kg) of rVWF for each subject was to be equivalent (±10%) 
to the weekly pdVWF dose received during prophylactic treatment before the study. The total weekly dose 
of IP was to be divided into 2 separate infusions given on 2 separate days of the week (Schedule A). 
Based on the total weekly dose or other clinical judgement, the total weekly dose may have been 
administered as 3 infusions (Schedule B; e.g. infusions on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday). A once 
weekly dose regimen was allowed only if the subject had been on a once weekly dose regimen with 
pdVWF. For all subjects, dose escalations (not exceeding an upper limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF per infusion) 
and increases of dosing frequency were allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response as evidenced 
by breakthrough bleeding episodes. The criteria for dose and/or frequency escalation were specific to 
each bleeding indication but, overall, involved 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the 
subject being compliant with scheduled prophylaxis treatment. In general, the dose per infusion was 
escalated (up to a maximum of 80 IU/kg) before the dosing frequency was increased. 
Bleeding episodes and surgery 
In case of an acute bleeding episode, the subject was to be treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE. If 
endogenous FVIII was below 30% to 40% or was unknown and could not be estimated from the subject’s 
PK study, an infusion of rVWF:ADVATE at an ratio of 1.3:1 ±0.2 was to be administered initially. 
Subsequent infusions were to be with 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo with or, in many cases, without 30 to 45 
IU/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fell below 30 IU/L during the treatment 
period). 
In case of surgery, 12 to 24 hours prior to the procedure, a priming dose with rVWF (based on the 
subject’s IR and t1/2) was to be infused to allow the endogenous FVIII levels to raise to at least 30 IU/dL 
(minor, oral surgery) or 60 IU/dL (major surgery) at the time the loading dose of rVWF was infused. VWF 
and FVIII levels were to be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results were to be 
available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to the loading dose administration 
were not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery) or 60 IU/dL (major surgery), ADVATE was to be 
administered in addition to rVWF in order to raise FVIII activity to the targeted levels. The preoperative 
loading dose was calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels 
divided by the IR (ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR) with IR at Cmax defined as (Cmax-Cpre-dose)/Dose. If the IR was 
not available, an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg was to be assumed. For minor and oral surgery, the IR from 
the preoperative Priming Dose visit was to be used to guide dosing, and the target peak was 50-60 IU/dL 
VWF:RCo and 40-50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery, the target peak was 100 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80-100 
IU/dL FVIII. 
Subjects undergoing minor surgery were to be infused with rVWF every 12 to 24 hours or every other 
day, targeting >30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII) for at least the first 48 hours. Subjects undergoing oral 
surgery were to be infused with rVWF at least once within the first 8 to 12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL 
(rVWF and FVIII). 
Subjects undergoing major surgery were to be infused with rVWF every 12 to 24 hours for at least the 
first 72 hours post-surgery, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII trough activity >50 IU/dL, followed by further 
treatment post-72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and 
FVIII trough activity of >30 IU/dL. 
Objectives 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity, thrombogenicity, and hypersensitivity 
reactions), as well as PK, PD, health-related quality of life, and pharmacoeconomics of prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa in adult patients with severe VWD.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
•  Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for spontaneous (not related to trauma) BEs during prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  ABR percent reduction success for Prior OD subjects, defined as at least 25% reduction of ABR 
based on spontaneous BEs during vonicog alfa prophylaxis relative to the subject’s own historical 
ABR during OD VWF treatment prior to this study 
•  ABR preservation success for Switch subjects, defined as achieving an ABR based on spontaneous 
BEs during vonicog alfa prophylaxis that was no greater than the subject’s own historical ABR 
based on spontaneous BEs during prophylactic treatment with pdVWF prior to this study 
•  Categorized spontaneous ABR (sABR) defined as 0, >0 to 2, >2 to 5, or >5 during prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa 
• 
• 
Total number of infusions and the average number of infusions per week during prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa 
Total weight adjusted consumption of vonicog alfa during prophylactic treatment 
•  ABR for spontaneous BEs by location of bleeding (gastrointestinal [GI], epistaxis, joint bleeding, 
menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle, and soft tissue, etc) while on prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa 
Sample size 
Approximately 22 adult subjects with severe VWD (baseline VWF:RCo <20 IU/dL) were planned to be 
included in the study. The aim was to have at least 8 subjects in each cohort (OD and switch). A total of 
at least 5 type 3 VWD subjects were planned to be followed for 12 months. The sample size was driven 
by practical considerations (primarily the enrollment of a rare patient population) and EMA Guideline on 
the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products 
(CPMP/BPWG/220/02). 
Randomisation 
Not applicable as this is a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable as this is an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary outcome measure is ABR for spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes during 
prophylactic treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa). No formal statistical hypothesis test was planned for the 
analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 27/71 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy analysis was planned to be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and was planned to 
be summarized by the two cohorts: on-demand and switch subjects. As a supportive analysis, the same 
analysis was planned to be carried out on the Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set. 
The FAS was planned to be composed of all subjects who receive prophylaxis IP treatment. 
The PP Analysis Set was planned to be composed of subjects who are at least 70% compliant regarding 
the number of scheduled prophylactic infusions (as measured by the ratio of actual number of infusions to 
planned number of infusions). Only subjects who met all study entry criteria and who had no major 
protocol violations that might impact primary efficacy assessments were planned to be included in the PP 
analysis set. 
The Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS) consisted of all subjects who received prophylaxis treatment with 
IP and did not have data (entire infusion or bleed record[s]) identified to be removed due to lack of 
proper ALCOA-C (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, and Complete; ICH E6 R2) 
compliant source documentation. This analysis set was used for supportive analyses of efficacy (not 
prespecified in the study protocol but introduced ad-hoc due to insufficient quality of source data). 
The spontaneous ABR while treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort was planned to be estimated 
using a negative binomial regression. The prior ABR was planned to be based on historical data collected 
from each enrolled subject. 
The two ABRs (prior to prophylaxis treatment and while on prophylaxis) for each cohort were planned to 
be compared within each subject using a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) (with a 
logarithmic link function, the default for the negative binomial distribution), accounting for the fixed effect 
of the two treatments. The follow-up time (in years) was planned to be specified as an offset. The ratio of 
ABR while in the study to historical ABR was planned to be estimated and reported together with the 95% 
confidence interval for each of the two cohorts. 
The difference in on-study ABR relative to historical ABR was planned to be summarized descriptively. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In Study 071301, 23 subjects were given at least one dose of prophylactic vonicog alfa as study 
treatment and 17 subjects completed the study. In the Prior OD group, 13 subjects started prophylactic 
vonicog alfa treatment, 4 subjects were early terminated (discontinued) from the study, and 9 subjects 
completed the study. In the Switch group, 10 subjects started prophylactic vonicog alfa, 2 subjects were 
early terminated (discontinued) from the study, and 8 subjects completed the study. No subject 
discontinued the study for lack of efficacy. One subject discontinued due to the non-serious adverse event 
(AE) of headache.

efficacy of BE treatment and perioperative management were moved from secondary to 
exploratory objectives 
- 
addition of new steady-state PK parameters and PD parameters 
-  Redefinition of the FAS as all subjects who receive prophylaxis IP treatment 
-  Removal of the interim analysis 
Protocol deviations: 
One subject had a critical deviation related to eligibility: enrollment despite meeting exclusion criterion 
#7, a history of immune disorders. Of the 23 subjects in the SAF, 17 (73.9%) had at least one major 
protocol deviation. The most common major protocol deviations were related to IP administration and 
source documentation criteria (lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation). 
The eDiary did not function as intended. An eDiary was used to capture all bleeding and infusion events 
that occurred offsite (i.e. when the subject was not at the clinic). These data, entered directly into the 
eDiary by each subject, were considered source data. Some subjects did not or could not always use the 
eDiary device (due to technical issues and/or user errors) to report their bleed and infusion data and 
reported this information to the site staff, either during their next visit or over the phone. An eCRF page 
was developed to capture this bleed and infusion data not recorded in the eDiary. Ultimately, an internal 
audit of Study 071301 revealed that the mechanism of capturing these data by sites did not always meet 
proper ALCOA-C criteria for source documentation. A corrective and preventative action plan was 
implemented to ensure data integrity in the study. Study conduct improved post-audit, leading to 
improved compliance by subjects in recording bleed and infusion data in the eDiary from the use of more 
updated electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) technology. 
Source data verification (SDV) was reperformed for all bleed and infusion data in the eCRF. Site queries 
were generated for all data that did not meet ALCOA-C criteria. Any instances for which a monitor was 
unsure if proper source documentation existed were reviewed by a Data Council, which completed their 
review of impacted data and issued queries requesting sites to remove data for which proper ALCOA-C-
compliant source did not exist. Ten subjects from 8 sites had either infusion or bleed data identified to be 
removed due to lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation. No bleeding data were removed from 
the database because one site did not agree to remove bleeding data for the 1 subject with BEs (16 of 
them) identified as lacking ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation. However, 10 subjects had one or 
more entire IP infusions removed from the database for lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source 
documentation. Because of this situation, the SAP included analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints in the mFAS, which excluded the 10 subjects with entire bleed or IP infusion record(s) 
identified to be removed due to lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation.  
The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on study conduct was minimal. 
Subject enrollment ended before the pandemic started and subjects could self-administer study drug at 
home. By necessity, BEs that required in-clinic treatment or other medical attention still required such 
treatment/attention. There were some COVID-19 related protocol deviations but only 1 was a major 
protocol deviation. 
The conduct of Study 071301 was strongly affected by a lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source 
documentation due to issues related to a malfunctioning eDiary device. During the pre-submission 
meeting held on 29 June 2022, the MAH presented the following tabular listing of subjects who had either 
infusion or bleed data affected by the lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 30/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In total, 10/23 subjects who received prophylactic treatment in Study 071301 had either infusion (all 10 
subjects) or bleed (1 of 10 subject) records proposed to be queried for removal from the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system due to inadequate source documentation. Ultimately, only infusion records were 
removed from the database. Reported bleed records of a subject were retained by the site in the 
database due to their conviction that the written records provided by the subject, even without 
signature/date, were still sufficient as source document verification. These records were included in the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
Given the study’s primary endpoint (i.e. sABR), the decision not to remove the impacted bleeding data 
(affecting 1 study subject) from the primary analysis can be considered a conservative approach avoiding 
potential bias in favour of the study drug and hence appears acceptable. As a result, data removal had no 
impact on the study’s primary efficacy endpoint. 
To allow for an assessment of the impact of data removal on the efficacy results, the MAH defined and 
analysed a modified FAS (mFAS) which includes only subjects who did not have data identified to be 
removed. As such, the mFAS can be considered to represent a worst-case scenario providing a certain 
degree of reassurance. 
In addition, in the integrated efficacy analyses, the MAH defined a rollover subset FAS (rollover sFAS), 
including all subjects whose data were identified for removal in Study 071301 and who rolled over to the 
continuation study SHP677-304 for continued prophylactic treatment (Cohorts 1 and 2). As such, for 4 of 
the 10 subjects affected by data removal, the rollover sFAS allows for a within subject comparison of 
efficacy results between Study 071301 and Study SHP677-304 (in which no data were removed) to 
demonstrate consistency (despite differences in compliance rates). Notably, 2 of the 3 subjects who had a 
considerable degree (i.e. >50%) of infusion data removed for ALCOA-C non-compliance in Study 071301 
rolled over into Study SHP677-304. The third subject with >50% of infusion data removed from the EDC 
discontinued early from the study and contributed only a total of 5 on-study infusions to the FAS. For the 
remaining 7 subjects, the majority of infusion data were ALCOA-C compliant with proportions of non-
compliance of 0.84%, 3.33%, 3.55%, 5.00%, 8.53%. 12.82% and 17.86%, respectively. 
Baseline data 
Subject demography and baseline characteristics for the 23 FAS subjects in Study 071301 are 
summarised in tables 14 and 15 below.

Table 14. Study 071301 Subject Demographics and 
VWD Type (Full Analysis Set) 
Table 15. Study 071301 Historical bleeding during the 
prior 12 Month (Full Analysis Set) 
Approximately half of the subjects were male, and half were female. The majority (i.e. 78%) of subjects 
had Type 3 VWD. Overall, composition of the study population is considered adequate and representative 
of the intended target population (i.e. adult patients suffering from severe VWD). 
The subject’s medical history included documented history of on-demand or pdVWF prophylaxis treatment 
for at least the past 12 months and documented history (e.g. patient charts and prescription information) 
of all bleeding episodes within the past 12 months (up to 24 months if available). 
Numbers analysed 
The FAS (i.e. the primary analysis set for efficacy) included 23 subjects who received prophylactic vonicog 
alfa treatment. The mFAS (i.e. subjects with no data identified to be removed for lack of ALCOA-C-
compliant documentation) comprised 13 subjects (6 Prior OD and 7 Switch subjects). The PPAS (i.e. 
subjects who were ≥70% compliant with the planned prophylactic treatment regarding the number of 
scheduled prophylactic infusions and had no major protocol deviations that might impact primary efficacy 
assessments) comprised 16 subjects (8 Prior OD and 8 Switch). 
Overall, mean duration of vonicog alfa prophylaxis was approximately 10.7 months (ranging from 0.1 to 
16.3 months). Mean treatment compliance was >80% for both the Prior OD and Switch groups. Through 
Month 12, most (82.6%) FAS subjects were at least 70% compliant. In the mFAS, mean duration of 
vonicog alfa prophylaxis was approximately 9.7 months (ranging from 1.0 to 16.0 months); the decrease 
relative to the FAS was driven by the Prior OD group (mean duration of approximately 10.1 months in the 
FAS but only approximately 8.3 months in the mFAS). Mean treatment compliance was >90% for both 
the Prior OD and Switch groups. Through Month 12, all (100.0%) mFAS subjects were at least 70% 
compliant. 
Endpoints Related to bleeding events: 
For Study 071301, the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint on-study sABR was performed

function. The model-based comparison of on-study to historical sABR is presented for the FAS with on-
study data through Month 12 in Table 16 below. 
Table 16. Study 071301 Primary Efficacy Analysis: Comparison of On-Study sABR Through 
Month 12 vs Historical sABR Using a Negative Binomial Model (Full Analysis Set) 
For the Prior OD group, there was a 91.5% reduction in the sABR when comparing on-study sABR (mean 
sABR=0.555) to the historical sABR (mean sABR=6.541). The model-based mean sABR ratio (on-
study:historical) was 0.085 (95% CI: [0.021, 0.346]) for the Prior OD group. For the Switch group, the 
model-based mean sABR ratio (on-study:historical) was 0.550 (95% CI: [0.086, 3.523]) which 
corresponded to a reduction of 45.0% from historical to on-study sABR. The same analysis of sABR was 
repeated for the mFAS, PPAS, and VWD Type 3 subjects in the FAS and the mFAS. These results were 
consistent in direction and magnitude with the results for the FAS through Month 12.

Regardless of study analysis population/analysis subsets, >80% of Prior OD subjects achieved sABR 
reduction success (defined as ≥25% reduction in on-study sABR compared with historical sABR) and 
>90% of Switch subjects achieved sABR preservation success (defined as on-study sABR no greater than 
historical sABR). When only Type 3 VWD subjects were considered, regardless of study 
population/analysis subsets, >80% of Prior OD subjects achieved sABR reduction success and >87% of 
Switch subjects achieved sABR preservation success on study treatment through Month 12. 
In the FAS, 5 subjects (2 Prior OD and 3 Switch) experienced on-study spontaneous BEs that were 
treated with VWF through Month 12 (summarized in the table below). None of the spontaneous treated 
BEs was fatal or life-threatening. None of the spontaneous treated BEs was a body cavity, GI, or central 
nervous system (CNS) bleed.

Study SHP677-304: A Phase 3b, Prospective, Open-label, Uncontrolled, 
Multicenter Study on Long-term Safety and Efficacy of rVWF in Pediatric and 
Adult Subjects with Severe von Willebrand Disease (VWD) 
Methods 
Study SHP677-304 is an ongoing, Phase 3b, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, 
multicentre study evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of vonicog alfa for prophylaxis and OD 
treatment of BEs in paediatric and adult subjects with severe VWD. As part of the current submission, the 
MAH presents an interim analysis of data obtained in adults who rolled over from the parent Study 
071301 to Study SHP677-304. Consequently, the presented interim analysis (with a data cut-off date of 
30 Jun 2022) is limited to data obtained in Cohorts 1 and 2 for efficacy and Cohorts 1, 2, and 6 for safety.

•  Cohort 1: Subjects transitioning from Study 071301 who were to remain on the same 
prophylactic dose as in Study 071301 
•  Cohort 2: Subjects transitioning from Study 071301, with no clinically significant BE within the 
past 6 months, who were to start Study SHP677-304 at a lower dose/frequency compared to the 
dose received in Study 071301 
•  Cohort 6: Adult subjects from Study 071301 who (based on medical assessment and/or subject’s 
individual preference) switched back from prophylactic to OD treatment in Study SHP677-304. 
For all cohorts, during the entire study observation period, any BE that required substitution therapy with 
VWF concentrate was to be treated with vonicog alfa with or without recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII). If 
surgery was needed, subjects received vonicog alfa, with or without rFVIII, for management of 
perioperative bleeding. 
The minimum observation time was 12 months. After this initial 12-month period, subjects could continue 
to be enrolled in the study until vonicog alfa was commercially available in their respective countries, or 
until subjects had been treated in the study for a maximum of 3 years, whichever occurred first.

Statistical methods 
No statistical hypothesis testing was done in this study. The analysis set for efficacy was the FAS, which 
consisted of all subjects who satisfied all entry criteria and received any amount of vonicog alfa for 
prophylactic treatment (i.e. subjects belonging to Cohorts 1 and 2). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 17 subjects who completed Study 071301, 11 subjects (5 Prior OD and 6 Switch) continued 
prophylactic vonicog alfa treatment in Study SHP677-304. Of the 11 subjects, 10 subjects continued with 
their prophylactic treatment at the same dosing regimen as during Study 071301 (Cohort 1) and 1 
subject decreased the dosing frequency level (Cohort 2): Eight (8) of the 10 subjects who rolled over 
from Study 071301 into Cohort 1 were receiving 2× weekly vonicog alfa infusions and 1 subject was 
receiving 1× weekly vonicog alfa infusions in Study 071301; these subjects continued these dosing 
frequencies in Study SHP677-304. One subject in Cohort 1 was receiving 3× weekly vonicog alfa infusions 
in Study 071301 and initially continued to do so in Study SHP677-304; this subject had a dosing interval

change from 3× weekly to 2× weekly on 19 Jul 2021, this change was not captured in the dose 
adjustment form but was reflected in the infusion records. One subject who rolled over into Cohort 2 had 
the dosing regimen reduced from 2× weekly in Study 071301 to 1× weekly in Study SHP677-304. The 
remaining 2 subjects did not continue prophylactic treatment and entered Cohort 6. 
Up to the cut-off date of the presented interim analysis, 3 subjects in Cohort 1 and both subjects in 
Cohort 6 completed the study. No subjects had discontinued the study. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol dated 29 August 2018 was amended 3 times. None of the introduced changes 
affected key determinates of the study’s design or its scientific integrity. 
Up to the cut-off date of the presented interim analysis, there were 20 major protocol deviations reported 
in 7 subjects. Major protocol deviations were reported in 6 subjects in Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 6 
and involved deviations in IP compliance, study procedures criteria, laboratory assessment criteria, 
informed consent criteria, administrative criteria, efficacy criteria, other criteria, and SAE criteria. 
Baseline data

Endpoints Related to Vonicog Alfa Infusions and Weight-based Consumption 
Throughout the entire study, the mean total number of prophylactic vonicog alfa infusions in Cohort 1 
was 247.6 infusions, with a range of 104 to 310 infusions. The mean number of vonicog alfa infusions per 
week in Cohort 1 was 1.882, with a range of 1.00 to 2.50; the subject in Cohort 2 received a mean of 
1.003 weekly infusions. The mean weekly vonicog alfa infusion dose for Cohort 1 was 94.80 IU/kg, with a 
range of 54.61 to 144.53 IU/kg. The 1 subject in Cohort 2 received 129 vonicog alfa infusions, with a 
mean weekly dose of 64.38 IU/kg. The mean total vonicog alfa dose per subject was 12403.025 IU/kg, 
with a range of 6334.32 to 16974.59 IU/kg, in Cohort 1; the subject in Cohort 2 received a total vonicog 
alfa dose of 8277.920 IU/kg. 
Table 25. Study SHP677-304 Cohorts 1 and 2 Prophylactic Study Drug Administration (Full 
Analysis Set) 
As of the data cut-off date, a total of 68 BEs (55 spontaneous BEs) occurred in Cohorts 1 and 2. 36 BEs of 
all causes were treated in 5 subjects. A total of 35 all-cause BEs were treated with vonicog alfa and 19 
were treated with ADVATE. The mean number of vonicog alfa infusions to treat a BE was 1.2 (1 subject 
had a vonicog alfa infusion to treat a bleed, which was not included in the listing due to a data entry 
error). The mean total vonicog alfa infused per bleed was 56.2 IU/kg per infusion. The majority of treated 
BEs (35 of 36) were assessed with an efficacy rating of “Excellent”. 
Of the 32 spontaneous BEs that required treatment, 17 (53.1%) were severe, 9 (28.1%) were moderate, 
and 6 (18.8%) were mild. The majority of the treated spontaneous BEs were in the locations of other 
(heavy menstrual bleeds) (17 BEs, 53.1%) and mucosal (13 BEs, 40.6%), with 2 BEs (6.3%) in the joint 
location and 1 BE (3.1%) in the skin location. The efficacy ratings for treated spontaneous BEs were 
“Excellent” (96.9%) and “Good” (3.1%)

Ancillary analyses 
Exposure-response Analyses 
Based on the final dataset from the prophylaxis Study 071301 and the interim data of Study SHP677-304 
(Cohorts 1 and 2), the MAH conducted an ER analysis to investigate the effect of different VWF:RCo PK 
parameters on spontaneous BEs requiring treatment to investigate any causal links between PK/PD and 
BEs during prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa. 
For ER modelling, the exposure input was obtained from the population PK model simulations (see section 
2.3.4 above). To test for an effect of VWF:RCo exposure, the simulated PK parameters included:  
(1)  the trough VWF:RCo level prior to the BE, 
(2)  the average levels of VWF:RCo in the dosing interval prior to the BE, and  
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 43/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)  the average VWF:RCo over the 24 hours prior to the BE.  
In a first step, model discrimination was performed by comparing the goodness-of-fit of linear and 
nonlinear ER models using the PK input as described above. Of all models tested, a repeated time-to-
event (RTTE) model with a linear ER function linking the average levels of VWF:RCo over 24 hours prior 
to the spontaneous BE was associated with the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion). 
A statistically significant ER was observed for VWF:RCo (p<0.05), whereby higher exposures were 
associated with a lower risk of spontaneous BEs. 
The HRs for the probability of bleeding as a function of the daily average activity at steady state (Cave,ss) 
of VWF:RCo for BIW or QW dosing of vonicog alfa as well as pdVWF are presented in the Figure below.

Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Table 27.  Summary of Efficacy for Study 071301: 
Title: A Prospective, Phase 3, Open-label, International Multicenter Study on Efficacy and 
Safety of Prophylaxis with rVWF in Severe von Willebrand Disease 
Study identifier 
071301; EudraCT Number: 2016-001478-14 
Design 
This was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, international, 
multicenter, Phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety (including 
immunogenicity, thrombogenicity, and hypersensitivity reactions), as well as 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, health-related quality of life, and 
pharmacoeconomics of prophylactic treatment regimen with vonicog alfa 
(recombinant von Willebrand factor; rVWF) in adult subjects with severe von 
Willebrand disease (VWD). 
Subjects received prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa for a 12-month 
period; a longer duration was allowed if a study site did not have Continuation 
Study SHP677-304 initiated by the time a subject finished Month 12 in Study 
071301. Any bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF 
concentrate to control bleeding was to be treated with vonicog alfa with or 
without ADVATE (recombinant factor VIII). The dose was to be determined 
according to the bleeding type and severity, and it was to be adjusted based on 
the subject’s clinical response. 
After completing the study, subjects could continue into Continuation Study 
SHP677-304 during which they could continue receiving prophylactic vonicog alfa 
treatment or switch to on-demand vonicog alfa therapy.

Hypothesis 
No formal hypothesis testing was performed. 
Intra-subject comparisons of on-study and historical data were performed for the 
Prior On-demand (OD) and Switch groups. 
Treatment groups  Prior On-demand (OD) 
Prophylactic vonicog alfa for 12 to 15 months 
This group included subjects 
who were receiving on-demand 
VWF prior to this study and had 
≥3 documented spontaneous 
bleeds (not including 
menorrhagia) requiring VWF 
treatment during the 12 months 
prior to this study.  
Treatment was initiated with twice-weekly 
infusions of 50±10 IU/kg per infusion. 
Dose adjustment to higher dose/frequency (up 
to 80 IU/kg per infusion, up to 3 infusions per 
week) was allowed due to individual variation 
in drug response. 
Number of subjects enrolled: 13 
Switch 
Prophylactic vonicog alfa for 12 to 15 months 
This group included subjects 
who had been receiving 
prophylactic plasma-derived 
von Willebrand factor (pdVWF) 
treatment for at least 
12 months prior to this study. 
Initial treatment was based on matching 
(±10%) the weekly pdVWF dose of each 
subject’s prior pdVWF prophylaxis regimen. The 
initial prophylactic treatment regimen was 
twice weekly for most subjects but in some 
cases was 1 or 3 times a week, depending on 
the total weekly dose and the dosing regimen 
used in their previous pdVWF prophylaxis 
regimen.

Analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were repeated for the 
FAS using data through the end-of-study visit. Selected analyses were repeated for 
the mFAS and the PPAS; similar results were observed. The consistency of results 
for the FAS and the mFAS showed that data identified for removal for lack of 
ALCOA-C-compliant documentation did not change the overall efficacy conclusions 
of the study.

Title: A Phase 3b, Prospective, Open label, Uncontrolled, Multicenter Study on Long-term 
Safety and Efficacy of rVWF in Pediatric and Adult Subjects with Severe von Willebrand 
Disease 
Study identifier 
SHP677-304; EudraCT Number: 2018-003453-16 
Design 
This is an ongoing, Phase 3b, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, 
nonrandomized, multicenter study evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of 
vonicog alfa for prophylaxis and on-demand (OD) treatment of bleeding episodes 
(BEs) in pediatric and adult subjects with severe VWD. 
The study includes 6 cohorts in total: 4 prophylactic treatment cohorts and 2 OD 
treatment cohorts. However, only 2 of the cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) are relevant 
for the efficacy analyses of prophylactic vonicog alfa treatment included in this 
Type II Variation for the addition of a prophylaxis indication. These cohorts include 
only subjects who completed Prophylaxis Study 071301, in either the Prior OD or 
the Switch group. 
Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 continued prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa. 
The minimum observation time for this study was 12 months. After this initial 12-
month period, subjects could continue to be enrolled in the study until vonicog alfa 
was commercially available in their respective countries, or until subjects had been 
treated in the study for a maximum of 3 years, whichever occurred first. 
Any BE requiring substitution therapy with VWF concentrate to control bleeding 
was to be treated with vonicog alfa, with or without ADVATE (recombinant factor 
VIII; rFVIII). Dose and frequency were individualized based on the subject’s

Notes 
As of the interim analysis cutoff date, no subjects had discontinued the study. 
The overall mean duration of study participation for the 11 subjects in Cohorts 1 
and 2 through the interim analysis cutoff date of 30 Jun 2022 was 918.8 days 
(minimum 725 days, maximum 1094 days; ie, approximately 2 to 3 years). 
Together with the vonicog alfa prophylaxis these subjects received in Study 
071301 (at least 1 year), this provides approximately 3 to 4 years of data to 
support the sustained efficacy of long-term prophylactic vonicog alfa treatment.

For subjects who completed Study 071301 and entered Study SHP677-304, the MAH performed an 
integrated analyses of data, i.e. from the day of the first dose of vonicog alfa prophylactic treatment in 
Study 071301 through the data cut-off date (30 Jun 2022) in the ongoing Continuation Study SHP677-
304. Participant flow across the two studies is shown in the figure below.

Analysis Sets 
Eleven subjects were included in the integrated efficacy analyses. Seventeen subjects completed Study 
071301, and 13 subjects entered Study SHP677-304. However, 2 subjects entered Cohort 6 of Study 
SHP677-304 (i.e. switched back to OD treatment) and were excluded from the integrated efficacy 
analyses. 
Efficacy analyses were performed for the following analysis sets: 
•  Rollover full analysis set (Rollover FAS): All subjects who received prophylactic treatment with 
vonicog alfa across Studies 071301/SHP677-304 (Cohorts 1 and 2) (N=11). 
•  Rollover subset full analysis set (Rollover sFAS): All subjects who received prophylactic treatment 
with vonicog alfa across Studies 071301/SHP677-304 (Cohorts 1 and 2) and had data identified 
to be removed due to lack of proper ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation in Prophylaxis 
Study 071301 (N=4). Note: No data were removed in Study SH677-304, so subjects in the 
Rollover sFAS had data removed in Prophylaxis Study 071301 but not in Study SH677-304.  
Efficacy data were summarized in a descriptive manner. 
Rollover Full Analysis Set  
For the 11 subjects in the Rollover FAS, mean duration of vonicog alfa prophylaxis was approximately 44 
months (ranging from 36.4 to 51.4 months). Treatment compliance was high (mean % compliance

approximately 92%) for the 11 subjects throughout the combined studies. For the Prior OD subjects, a 
reduction in the mean on-study sABR change from historical sABR was observed in the Rollover FAS. This 
was also the case when subjects in the Rollover FAS were analyzed by sex, race, and geographic region. 
For the Switch subjects, a slight reduction in mean on-study sABR change from historical sABR (when the 
subjects were treated prophylactically with pdVWF) was observed. Among the treated on-study 
spontaneous BEs, there was no body cavity bleed, no GI bleed, and no CNS bleed.

Nine of the 11 Rollover FAS subjects were on a 2× weekly infusion regimen throughout Study 071301. In 
Study SHP677-304, 8 of the 11 subjects started on the 2× weekly regimen, 2 subjects started on a 1× 
weekly regimen (1 additional subject had the dosing frequency reduced from 2× weekly in Study 071301 
to 1× weekly based on meeting criteria for dose reduction and cohort assignments), and 1 subject started 
on a 3× weekly regimen. As of the data cut-off date (30 Jun 2022), 1 subject decreased prophylactic 
vonicog alfa dosing frequency from 3× weekly to 2× weekly (this reduction was due to no significant 
bleeding in the period rather than any dose-related safety considerations) and 1 subject increased dose 
(40 to 60 IU/kg) without increasing dose frequency during Study SHP677-304.

The Rollover sFAS of 4 subjects with some infusion data removed for lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source 
documentation was used to compare sABR and compliance results during Study 071301 (in which 10 
subjects had some infusion records removed from the database because of lack of ALCOA-C-compliant 
source documentation) with results during Study SHP677-304 (in which subjects did not have data 
removed for lack of ALCOA-C-compliant source documentation) to demonstrate consistency of ABR 
results across studies within a subject despite differences in compliance rates. 
Three Rollover sFAS subjects were in the Prior OD cohort and 1 subject was in the Switch cohort. They 
received prophylactic vonicog alfa infusions 2× or 3× weekly throughout both Studies 071301 and 
SHP677-304. For the 3 Prior OD subjects, the reduction in sABR from historical to on-study was >25% 
(meeting treatment success criteria based on sABR reduction) during both studies with the reduction 
occurring in Study 071301 and maintained in Study SHP677-304. 
Historical and on-study treated sABRs for the Rollover sFAS subjects are summarized as follows:

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 071301 was an exploratory study with a small sample size and no prespecified hypotheses. The 
design of Study 071301 has been subject to CHMP Protocol Assistance 
(EMEA/H/SA/1378/2/FU/1/2014/PA). Overall, the final design of the study, the number and type of 
enrolled subjects and the duration of follow-up comply with the guideline on clinical investigation of 
plasma-derived VWF (CPMP/BPWG/220/02). CHMP recommendations concerning the in-/exclusion 
criteria, endpoints, observation period and statistical plan have been taken into account. However, 
although considered in principle acceptable (particularly in view of the rarity of the targeted disease), the 
lack of randomization and the use of historical control data (i.e. external knowledge) instead of a run-in 
phase represent potential sources of bias. 
Additional uncertainties arise from the introduction of a switch cohort (i.e. patients already receiving 
prophylactic treatment prior to study entry) with Global Protocol Amendment 6. In this context, it is noted 
that (i) the EMA clinical guideline (CPMP/BPWG/220/02) does not specify any requirements with regards 
to the prior treatment of study subjects, and (ii) CHMP considered the inclusion of patients already 
receiving prophylactic treatment to be acceptable in principle (EMEA/H/SA/1378/2/FU/1/2014/PA). 
However, as a potential selection bias due to an enrichment of favourable responders in the Switch group 
cannot be excluded, special attention should be paid to the pre-defined subgroup analyses of Prior OD 
subjects. In fact, with protocol amendment 6, patients with a poor response to prophylactic treatment 
(i.e. patients requiring more than 5 infusions or weekly doses exceeding 240 IU/kg at the time of 
screening) were formally excluded from the trial. 
Most notably, the conduct of Study 071301 was compromised by a malfunctioning eDiary device, 
resulting in ALCOA-C non-compliant source documentation. This issue affected at least 10 of the 23 study 
subjects (to varying degrees) raising concerns about the reliability and quality of data, particularly in 
relation to the results reported for the FAS. However, further analyses of a modified FAS (excluding 
subjects affected by the non-compliant source documentation) and the availability of additional data from 
the continuation study SHP677-304 for 4 of the 10 subjects affected provide a certain degree of 
reassurance on a negligible impact of identified cases of inappropriate source documentation on the 
reported efficacy outcomes. The MAH also clarified that per study protocol, if a BE could not be captured 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 55/71 
 
 
 
 
 
in the eDiary (e.g. due to device malfunction or user error), the subject still reported it to the study site 
(to receive instructions on treatment). Therefore, the study site was always able to record the BE in the 
EDC. In addition, the MAH pointed out that a subsequent review of EDC data (for confirming ALCOA-C 
compliant source documentation) did not result in any removal of BEs. Thus, the reporting of BEs can be 
considered complete.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Study 071301, all Prior OD subjects initiated vonicog alfa prophylactic treatment with 2× weekly 
infusions of 40 to 60 IU/kg per infusion. For Switch subjects, the initial vonicog alfa prophylactic 
treatment was based on matching (±10%) the weekly dose of their prior pdVWF prophylaxis regimen at 1 
to 3 times per week. Consumption data reveal that the vast majority of the 23 subjects stayed on the 
same dose and dosing frequency. Dose escalations were limited to one subject in the Prior OD group and 
two subjects in the Switch group. Upon request, the MAH provided more detailed information on changes 
in dosing regimens during the study. Noteworthy, the highest increased dose was 65 IU/kg 3 times 
weekly. The only subject who received a dose of 80 IU/kg received this dose once weekly in accordance 
with previous prophylaxis regimen. Thus, it is noted that the data obtained in Study 071301 fall short in 
providing support for the per protocol permitted dose escalation up to 80 IU/kg per prophylactic infusion. 
However, 1) the importance of an individualised approach to the treatment of VWD is well recognised, 2) 
the notion of a potentially necessary deviation from the recommended “standard prophylaxis regimen” in 
SmPC sections 4.2 is consistent with alternative VWF products, and 3) the proposed maximum dose of 80 
IU/kg corresponds to the currently approved maximum single dose of VEYVONDI. Hence, the proposed 
definition of a maximum prophylactic dose of 80 IU/kg in section 4.2 of the VEYVONDI SmPC is 
considered acceptable. 
In the FAS, prophylaxis with rVWF reduced the mean on-study sABR compared to historical sABR in Prior 
OD subjects by 91.5%, from 6.541 to 0.555, and in Switch subjects by 45.0%, from 0.514 to 0.283, 
based on analysis using a negative binomial model. Most (78.3%) subjects had zero treated spontaneous 
BEs while on rVWF prophylactic treatment (84.6% of Prior OD and 70% of Switch subjects) providing 
further support for a clinically meaningful reduction of bleeding events under long-term prophylactic 
treatment. 
However, high degree of interindividual heterogeneity and two remarkable cases with substantial 
numbers of untreated moderate and major bleeds (excluded from the primary analysis) were noted. The 
MAH clarified that for both subjects, high bleeding frequencies captured on-study support the validity of 
the reported high historical ABRs. In addition, Listing 16.2.4.14 confirms that historical BEs were indeed 
treated with VWF. The high frequency of “untreated” bleeding events on-study was explained by the per 
protocol option to receive non-VWF treatment (antifibrinolytics or topical hemostats). In fact, only if a 
bleeding had not stopped within 24 hours following administration of non-VWF treatment, infusions with 
vonicog alfa were to be started. Noteworthy, this permitted use of non-VWF treatments casts additional 
doubt on the value of comparisons to historical bleeding events. On the other hand, the frequent 
investigator’s decision to omit additional VWF treatment can be seen as an indication of less severe 
bleeding during prophylactic treatment. Considering only the spontaneous bleeds treated with VWF, both 
patients showed substantially improved ABRs with zero reported BEs during Study 071301. For one 
patient, a substantially improved ABR despite consideration of all on-study BEs (i.e. treated and 
untreated) provides reassurance on the beneficial impact of vonicog alfa treatment. For another patient, 
despite an overall similar rate of historical and on-study bleeds, a certain improvement can be derived 
from the apparent lack of additional (on-demand) VWF treatment. However, assessment of the case of 
this patient is further complicated by the concomitant prophylactic use of oral tranexamic acid as well as 
an early discontinuation from the study after only 1 month of treatment. Thus, overall, the MAH’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 56/71 
 
 
 
 
response falls short in relieving concerns regarding a lack of clinical benefit for the subject. However, 
since additional questions are not considered likely to reduce the remaining uncertainties, it is decided to 
not pursue this issue further.  
Additional sources of uncertainty relate to the actual severity of baseline bleeding phenotypes in the Prior 
OD cohort and a potential impact of concomitant haemostatic medication on the reported efficacy results. 
Moreover, results of Study 071301 revealed two cases of apparent worsening of disease phenotypes (i.e. 
substantially increased sABR despite initiation of or upon switching to vonicog alfa prophylaxis). The MAH 
clarified that for one patient, an sABR of only 0.5 in the continuation study (and sABR of 1.20 across both 
studies) provides reassurance on a beneficial impact of vonicog alfa prophylactic treatment. In this 
patient, reasons for the only incomplete bleeding protection remains hypothetical, particularly in view of 
the apparently unremarkable (i.e. satisfying) vonicog alfa-induced plasma levels of FVIII:C. On the other 
hand, the case of this patient may be explained by the generally heterogenous nature of VWD, natural 
fluctuations in disease severity and/or interindividual differences in treatment requirements, not 
questioning the value of prophylactic treatment per se. Since additional questions are not considered 
likely to shed any additional light on the apparently only incomplete bleeding protection of this patient, 
this issue was not pursued further.  
Of note, data obtained in the mFAS, excluding all subjects who had data removed from the EDC due to 
ALCOA-C non-compliant source documentation, was largely comparable to the data reported for the FAS 
arguing against a significant impact of the identified cases of inappropriate source documentation on the 
reported study outcomes. In this context, it is considered particularly noteworthy that even the Prior OD 
cohort in the mFAS meets the EMA clinical guideline requirement of a minimum of 5 patients with type 3 
VWD and showed results consistent with the overall reported outcomes. 
For 11 of the 17 patients who completed Study 071301, the interim report of study SHP677-304 provides 
supportive evidence of consistency and sustained efficacy of prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa 
beyond the 12-month duration of treatment in Study 071301. 
However, four of the subjects who completed Study 071301 did not rollover into Study SHP677-304 and 
two subjects rolled over but switched back to OD treatment. Importantly, the cases of switch backs were 
based on personal preference and not attributed to a lack of efficacy as evidenced by an sABR of zero 
under prophylactic treatment in Study 071301. Nevertheless, given the generally higher likelihood of a 
rollover of favourable responders (in fact, both subjects with an historical sABR >10 and 2 of the 5 
subjects with an sABR >0 under prophylactic treatment in study 071301 did not continue prophylactic 
treatment in Study SHP677-304), a potential impact of selection bias cannot be excluded and hence, the 
efficacy results obtained in Study SHP677-304 should be interpreted with caution.  
As of the cut-off date of the presented interim analysis, subjects who continued prophylactic treatment in 
Study SHP677-304 received treatment for an additional mean duration of 918.8 days (minimum 725 
days; maximum 1094 days). Eight of the 11 subjects started with a twice-a-week dosing regimen, 2 
subjects started with once per week dosing, and these subjects stayed on this initial dosing interval 
throughout the study. The remaining subject initiated with a 3× per week dosing regimen but had a 
dosing interval change from 3× per week to 2× per week during the study. 
Overall, the ABRs for treated spontaneous bleeds achieved with continued prophylactic vonicog alfa 
treatment were consistent with the ABRs observed in the parent study 071301. Six subjects out of 11 
achieved zero on-study spontaneous BEs that required additional treatment. In the 5 subjects with an 
sABR >0, bleeding rates remained low and in view of the anticipated natural fluctuations, the slight 
increases compared to the sABRs obtained in study 071301 do not raise concerns regarding a potential 
long-term weakening of prophylactic efficacy. Of note, there were no CNS or GI bleeds under prophylaxis 
and spontaneous joint bleeds requiring treatment were limited to two events (one major, one moderate) 
affecting a single subject. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 57/71 
 
 
 
 
However, compared to a frequency of major bleeding events of only 1% of treated bleeds in the historical 
database (cf. Table 15 in the CSR of Study 071301), the reported frequency of 55% of treated 
spontaneous bleeds classified as severe/major in Study SHP677-304 was considered remarkable and 
requires further justification to address concerns regarding a significant worsening of bleeding protection 
under prophylactic treatment with vonicog alfa. As requested, the MAH provided additional information on 
annualized bleeding rates (historical vs. on-study) considering only the subset of severe spontaneous BEs 
requiring VWF treatment. Importantly, when excluding a subject who experienced several severe BEs 
upon switching back from prophylactic treatment in Study 071301 to on-demand treatment in Study 
SHP677-304, the increased rate of severe BEs noticed in Study SHP677-304 was attributed to a single 
patient who contributed a total of 16 severe spontaneous BEs, mostly heavy menstrual bleeding, to the 
dataset. Possible reasons for the apparent shift towards an increased frequency of severe bleeds in this 
subject are not further discussed/specified and thus remain hypothetical. However, the apparently only 
incomplete bleeding protection of this patient may be explained by the heterogenous nature of VWD, 
natural fluctuations in disease severity, and/or interindividual differences in treatment requirements. 
Furthermore, a potential impact of the ultimately subjective attribution of bleeding severities is 
acknowledged. Overall, the MAH clarified that the apparent increase in severe BEs in Study SHP677-304 
(i.e. under continued vonicog alfa prophylactic treatment) was attributed to an isolated case, from which 
no general trend towards a higher frequency of more severe breakthrough bleeds can be deducted.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The totality of clinical data submitted with this application supports the efficacy of VEYVONDI in 
prophylactic treatment of adults with severe VWD. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The present application includes safety data for a total of 23 unique subjects exposed to vonicog alfa 
across studies 071301 and SHP677-304. Study 071301 safety data are presented for 23 adult subjects 
who are included in the safety analysis set. Study SHP677-304 safety data (data cut-off date 30 Jun 
2022) are presented for the 13 subjects who rolled over from Study 071301 into Study SHP677-304 
Cohort 1 (same prophylaxis regimen as Study 071301), Cohort 2 (prophylaxis at a reduced dose and/or 
frequency than Study 071301), or Cohort 6 (OD treatment) and are included in the safety analysis set. 
Three of the subjects in the vonicog alfa prophylaxis study (071301) and continuation study (SHP677-
304) also participated in the Phase 3 on-demand and surgery studies (1 in Study 071001 and 2 in Study 
071101). 
In addition, an Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) analysis was performed. The ISS included the 13 
subjects who completed Study 071301 after at least 12 months of vonicog alfa prophylactic treatment, 
rolled over into Study SHP677-304, and received at least 1 dose of vonicog alfa in Study SHP677-304 
(rollover safety analysis set). Safety data for the ISS and Study SHP677-304 are based on interim 
analyses since SHP677-304 was ongoing as of the data cut-off date (and is still ongoing). 
For detailed descriptions of Study 071301 and SHP677-304 and subject disposition across the two studies 
reference is made to section 2.4.1 and Figure 7 above. 
In general, safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (AEs), hypersensitivity, immunogenicity, and 
thrombogenicity and included the following evaluations:

•  Neutralising and binding antibodies to VWF 
•  Neutralising and binding antibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) 
•  Binding antibodies to CHO proteins, murine immunoglobulin G (IgG), and rFurin 
•  Signs of thrombosis or thromboembolic complications (clinical signs and measurement of 
thrombotic markers) 
•  Other IP-related AEs, including serious adverse events (SAEs), temporally associated AEs, AEs of 
special interest (AESIs; including thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions (including 
allergic reactions or anaphylactic reactions), clinically significant changes in routine laboratory 
parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry, and coagulation), and vital signs 
•  Viral serology (hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency 
virus 1/2, and human parvovirus B19) 
Patient exposure 
In Study 071301, the 23 subjects in the safety analysis set received vonicog alfa as prophylactic 
treatment for a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 10.7 (4.7) months. Overall, 23 subjects received 1813 
prophylactic infusions (1887 total vonicog alfa infusions for any reason) during 1813 exposure days. The 
mean number of prophylactic vonicog alfa infusions received per subject over the course of the study was 
78.8 and ranged from 2 to 142. The mean (SD) weight-adjusted prophylactic vonicog alfa dose per 
subject per month was 415.9 (154.4) IU/kg. Six subjects received a total of 42 vonicog alfa infusions as 
on-demand treatment for bleeds or to maintain hemostasis. Three subjects received at least 1 dose of 
ADVATE with vonicog alfa for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes. 
In Study SHP677-304, as of the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2022, the overall number of days on study for 
the 11 subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 ranged from 725 to 1094, and the number of prophylactic vonicog alfa 
infusions per subject ranged from 104 to 310. The 2 subjects in Cohort 6 spent 444 and 1094 days on 
study; these subjects did not receive prophylactic vonicog alfa infusions. Three subjects (2 from Cohort 1 
and 1 from Cohort 6) received at least 1 dose of ADVATE with vonicog alfa for on-demand treatment of 
bleeding episodes. 
In the ISS rollover safety analysis set, 13 subjects received vonicog alfa as prophylactic treatment for a 
mean (SD) of 39.03 (12.081) months across the 2 studies; 13 subjects received prophylactic treatment in 
Study 071301 for 13.49 (1.557) months and 11 out of the 13 subjects (Cohorts 1 and 2) received 
prophylactic treatment in Study SHP677-304 for 30.05 (4.554) months. 
Adverse events 
41 TEAEs were reported in 17/23 (73.9%) subjects during Study 071301; 76 TEAEs were reported in 
9/11 (81.8%) subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 and 11 TEAEs were reported in 2/2 (100%) subjects in Cohort 
6 during ongoing Study SHP677-304. A total of 113 TEAEs were reported in 12/13 (92.3%) subjects in 
the ISS at the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2022. 
In Study 071301, most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate; 4 severe TEAEs (2 serious and 2 non-
serious) were reported in 3 (13.0%) subjects. There were no fatal or life-threatening events and most 
TEAEs were non-serious. Three treatment-emergent SAEs, all unrelated to the IP, were experienced by 3 
(13.0%) subjects. One (4.3%) subject discontinued vonicog alfa treatment due to a TEAE (non-serious 
headache) that was considered possibly related to vonicog alfa. No other TEAEs were considered to be

related to vonicog alfa. Two subjects experienced an AESI; both events (purpura [due to trauma] and 
rash pruritic) were nonserious, mild in severity, and not related to the IP. 
In Study SHP677-304, most of the TEAEs were mild. Severe TEAEs were reported for 2 (18.2%) subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 2 (bacteraemia and pneumonia in 1 subject and anaemia in 1 subject, both in Cohort 1) 
and for 2 (100%) subjects in Cohort 6 (ovarian cyst ruptured and anaemia in 1 subject each). No TEAEs 
were considered to be related to vonicog alfa. No AESIs were reported.

In both studies (071301 and SHP677-304) and the ISS, most TEAEs were experienced as a single 
occurrence by 1 subject. In Study 071301, the following TEAEs were each experienced by more than 1 
subject: headache (4 [17.4%] subjects), arthralgia (3 [13.0%] subjects), and ear infection, 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), joint injury, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2 
[8.7%] subjects each).  
In Study SHP677-304, the following TEAEs were each experienced by more than 1 subject in Cohorts 1 
and 2: headache (4 [36.4%] subjects) and abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, toothache, procedural 
pain, SARS-CoV-2 test positive, and anaemia (2 [18.2%] subjects each). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
In Study 071301, two (8.7%) subjects had 1 AESI each: a thromboembolic event of purpura (caused by 
trauma) and a hypersensitivity reaction of rash pruritic. Both events were mild, nonserious, and 
considered not related to the IP. Both events resolved with no action taken regarding study treatment. In 
Study SHP677-304, no AESIs were identified. 
Immunogenicity 
No subject developed binding antibodies to murine IgG, CHO protein, or rFurin. In Study 071301, no 
subject developed antibodies (binding or neutralising) to vonicog alfa or FVIII. In Study SHP677-304, no 
confirmed neutralising antibodies against human VWF or FVIII were reported. Two subjects each had 1 
transient occurrence of a positive result for VWF inhibitor assays: 1 subjects had a borderline positive 
result for neutralising antibody to von Willebrand factor:collagen binding (VWF:CB) at a postoperative 
unscheduled visit, and the other subject had positive results for neutralizing antibody to VWF:CB and 
VWF:RCo at the Month 2 follow-up visit. However, none of the positive results were confirmed by a 
second test. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 7 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs: multiple injuries from a fall, rheumatoid 
arthritis, urinary tract infection, haemoglobin decreased, bacteraemia, anaemia, and ovarian cyst 
ruptured) were reported in 5 of the 23 unique subjects in the 2 studies (n=3 in Study 071301 and n=4 in 
Study SHP677-304). None of the SAEs were fatal, life threatening, or considered related to vonicog alfa 
by the investigator or sponsor. 
Laboratory findings 
In both studies, no clinically significant abnormalities in haematology, clinical chemistry, or coagulation 
values were attributed to vonicog alfa. No trends in vital signs were noted, and no clinically significant 
electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex: Overall, given the low number of TEAEs of each category and the low number of subjects of either 
sex experiencing each TEAE, there was no obvious difference in the AE profiles between male and female 
subjects. 
Paediatric Population: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 61/71 
 
 
 
 
Geriatric Use: The number of subjects aged 65 years and older treated with vonicog alfa was too low 
(n=3 in the prophylaxis study) to determine whether this age group responds differently compared to 
younger subjects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study 071301, 1 (4.3%) subject discontinued vonicog alfa treatment due to a TEAE (non-serious 
headache) that was considered possibly related to vonicog alfa. No other TEAEs were considered to be 
related to vonicog alfa. No subjects have discontinued the ongoing Study SHP677-304 due to a TEAE as 
of the data cut-off date (30 Jun 2022). 
Post marketing experience 
As of 30 June 2022, the global cumulative post marketing subject exposure to vonicog alfa since launch is 
estimated to be approximately 19,347 patient-years.  
Post marketing ADRs reported in association with vonicog alfa treatment include two cases of 
anaphylactic reactions and two cases of infusion-related reactions (IRR). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of VEYVONDI in routine prophylaxis (i.e. the requested EOI) was assessed in 23 unique 
subjects (≥18 years). In study 071301, subjects received a total of 1813 prophylactic infusions (1887 
total vonicog alfa infusions for any reason) during 1813 exposure days. The number of prophylactic 
vonicog alfa infusions received per subject ranged from 2 to 142 with a mean of 78.8. As of the cut-off 
date of the presented interim report of Study SHP677-304, 11 of the 17 subjects who completed Study 
071301 received additional prophylactic infusions ranging from 104-310 (mean: 236.82) over a mean 
(SD) duration of 30.05 (4.554) months. As such, the newly provided data provides an extensive and 
valuable addition to the existing safety database. 
Notably, the population targeted by the requested EOI does not differ from the population for which the 
product is already approved (i.e. adults [age 18 and older] with von VWD, when DDAVP treatment alone 
is ineffective or not indicated). Given the known safety profile of VWF-containing products and the orphan 
nature of severe VWD, the small sample size of only 23 subjects is considered acceptable. 
VEYVONDI represents a recombinant VWF. Safety aspects of particular importance to this class of drug 
include the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, thrombogenicity and the development of binding and/or 
neutralising alloantibodies. All of these potential and/or identified risks were tightly monitored during the 
studies and captured as adverse events of special interest. 
Overall, safety data obtained in studies 071301 and SHP677-304 (up to the data cut-off date of the 
presented interim report) were consistent with previous clinical studies of VEYVONDI in VWD not 
indicating TEAEs specific to its long-term prophylactic use. TEAEs considered related to VEYVONDI were 
limited to a single case of moderate headache which occurred in Study 071301 and led to discontinuation 
from the study on day 37 of treatment. Noteworthy, this case has already been assessed in a previous 
variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/004454/II/0026, CHMP positive opinion on 12 January 2023) and led to 
the inclusion of headache as a very common ADR in section 4.8 of the VEYVONDI SmPC. 
Besides this, no other TEAEs reported in Studies 071301 and SHP677-304 were considered to be related 
to vonicog alfa. As of the data cut-off of the interim report of Study SHP677-304 no other subject 
discontinued prophylactic treatment due to a TEAE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 62/71 
 
 
 
 
In both studies, there were no fatal or life-threatening events and most TEAEs were non-serious. No 
thromboembolic event was assessed as related to vonicog alfa and no subject developed alloantibodies 
(binding or neutralising) to the drug. 
With this application no updates of the safety sections of the VEYVONDI SmPC are proposed which is 
considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, no new safety signals emerged from the newly presented data. Overall, the safety data 
presented with this application are consistent with previous clinical studies of VEYVONDI in VWD and 
support its safe and well tolerated use for long-term prophylactic treatment in adults. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) represents a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a loss or defective 
function of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF serves essential functions during haemostasis by promoting 
platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen at sites of vascular damage and by protecting the critical 
coagulation factor VIII from degradation. With this extension of indication the MAH is seeking to extend 
the indication to include "prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding 
episodes". 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of VWD largely depends on the type and severity of the disease. The mainstay of treatment is 
on-demand to control spontaneous bleeding or to prevent excessive bleeding during surgical procedures. 
However, a subset of patients with severe VWD (i.e. suffering from frequent and severe BEs) may benefit 
from long-term prophylactic treatment as also acknowledged by the wording of section 4.1 of the Core 
SmPC for human plasma derived VWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02) (“Prevention and treatment of haemorrhage 
or surgical bleeding in von Willebrand disease (VWD), when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is 
ineffective or contra-indicated”) and the recently published ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guideline on the 
management of VWD (Connell et al. 2021). Currently, several plasma-derived VWF/FVIII concentrates 
(containing different amounts and ratios of VWF and FVIII) are available for VWD prophylaxis treatment 
in the EU, including a centrally authorised product. Besides the problem of varying composition and 
overall plasma donor availability, drawbacks of plasma-derived VWF/FVIII products are given by a risk for 
excessive plasma FVIII levels (and an associated risk of thrombogenesis) upon repeated infusions and an 
at least theoretical risk of pathogen transmission as well as the presence of extraneous plasma proteins 
which may trigger allergic responses. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 071301: A Prospective, Phase 3, Open-label, International Multicenter Study on Efficacy and Safety 
of Prophylaxis with rVWF in Severe von Willebrand Disease 
Study SHP677-304: A Phase 3b, Prospective, Open-label, Uncontrolled, Multicenter Study on Long-term 
Safety and Efficacy of rVWF in Pediatric and Adult Subjects with Severe von Willebrand Disease  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the primary analysis of study 071301, prophylaxis with rVWF reduced the mean on-study sABR (annual 
bleeding rate for spontaneous bleeds treated with VWF infusions) compared to historical sABR in Prior OD 
subjects by 91.5%, from 6.541 to 0.555, and in Switch subjects by 45.0%, from 0.514 to 0.283, based 
on analysis using a negative binomial model. 
The as-observed data showed a mean (SD) sABR reduction from historical to on-study treatment period 
through Month 12 of -14.798 (42.1849) for Prior OD subjects and -3.308 (10.8569) for Switch subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 66/71 
 
 
 
 
At least 90% of Prior OD subjects (12 of 13; 92.3%) and Switch subjects (9 of 10; 90.0%) achieved 
treatment success as sABR reduction (defined as ≥25% reduction in on-study sABR compared with 
historical sABR) in the Prior OD group or sABR preservation (defined as on-study sABR no greater than 
historical sABR) in the Switch group, through Month 12. 
Most (78.3%) subjects had zero treated spontaneous BEs while on rVWF prophylactic treatment (84.6% 
of Prior OD and 70% of Switch subjects) providing further support for a clinically meaningful reduction of 
bleeding events under long-term prophylactic treatment. 
For 11 of the 17 patients who completed Study 071301, interim data of the continuation study SHP677-
304 provide further support for consistency and maintained efficacy of prophylactic treatment beyond the 
12-month duration of treatment in Study 071301 (with additional durations of treatment ranging from 
725 to 1094 days). Six of the 11 rollover subjects had no spontaneous BEs requiring additional vonicog 
alfa treatment and in the remaining 5 subjects, bleeding rates remained low with no evidence of a 
potential long-term loss or weakening of prophylactic efficacy. Noteworthy, there were no CNS or GI 
bleeds under prophylaxis. Spontaneous joint bleeds requiring treatment were limited to two events (one 
major, one moderate) affecting a single subject, and the vast majority of treated spontaneous 
breakthrough bleeds (31 of 32) were assessed with an efficacy rating of ‘Excellent’, with only 1 additional 
infusion of vonicog alfa per bleed required. 
In study 071301, all Prior OD subjects and 80% of Switch subjects started on a twice-a-week dosing 
regimen and the vast majority stayed on this regimen throughout the study with mean (SD) doses per 
infusion of 52.2 (3.8) IU/kg or 52.2 (16.2) IU/kg in Prior OD or Switch subjects, respectively. Across 
studies, dose escalations were limited to 1 Prior OD and 2 Switch subjects (both in study 071301). 
Furthermore, the proposed recommendation to initiate prophylactic treatment with a BIW 40-60 IU/kg 
regimen is supported by PK/PD model-based simulations predicting plasma FVIII:C levels in type 3 VWD 
to be above 40 IU/dL for an average of 5.29 days (i.e. 76% of weekly time). 
In addition, steady-state PK/PD assessments performed during prophylactic treatment in study 071301 
support the notion of a stable PK/PD behaviour of vonicog alfa over the duration of treatment, not only 
with regard to VWF:RCo PK but also with regard to the vonicog alfa-mediated upregulation of plasma 
FVIII activity with a statistically significant increase in trough (i.e. pre-dose) levels from 3.83 IU/dL at 
baseline to 18.7 IU/dL under prophylaxis in Prior OD subjects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties about the favourable effects arise from the only small sample size, the lack of 
randomization and the use of historical control data (i.e. external knowledge) instead of a run-in phase. 
However, the design of study 071301 has to be seen in the context of the rarity of the targeted disease, 
has been subject to CHMP Protocol Assistance (EMEA/H/SA/1378/2/FU/1/2014/PA) and complies with the 
requirements set forth in the EMA guideline on clinical investigation of plasma-derived VWF 
(CPMP/BPWG/220/02). 
Most notably, the conduct of Study 071301 was compromised by a malfunctioning eDiary device resulting 
in cases of ALCOA-C non-compliant source documentation. This issue affected at least 10 of the 23 study 
subjects (to varying degrees) raising concerns about the reliability and quality of data, particularly in 
relation to the results reported for the FAS. However, removal of data from the EDC was limited to 
infusion data and did not affect the primary analysis. Moreover, sensitivity analyses performed with a 
modified FAS (excluding subjects affected by the non-compliant source documentation) and the 
availability of additional data from study SHP677-304 for 4 of the 10 affected subjects provide some 
reassurance about the validity of the reported results. Moreover, it is considered noteworthy that even 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 67/71 
 
 
 
 
the Prior OD cohort in the mFAS meets the EMA clinical guideline requirement of a minimum of 5 patients 
with type 3 VWD and shows results consistent with the overall reported outcomes.  
In addition, the conduct of study 071301 was affected by several cases of early discontinuations which, 
even though not clearly attributable to a lack of efficacy, may have led to a certain enrichment of 
favourable responders and particularly questions the generalisability of steady-state PK data obtained at 
EOS, which are available for only 9 of the 13 Prior OD and 7 of the 10 Switch subjects who initiated 
treatment. Another source of bias may have resulted from the introduction of a switch cohort (i.e. 
patients already receiving prophylactic treatment prior to study entry) with Global Protocol Amendment 6. 
However, subgroup analysis of the Prior OD group provide reassurance on clinical efficacy in prophylaxis-
naïve subjects and comparisons between Switch and Prior OD subjects indicate largely similar results. 
Although a degree of heterogeneity seems inevitable given the targeted disease, two notable cases, both 
characterised by very high historical ABRs and a significant number of untreated moderate and major 
bleeds remain difficult to interpret and cast doubt on the appropriateness of excluding untreated bleeds 
from the primary analysis. For one of the two subjects, additional sensitivity analyses, considering not 
only treated but also untreated bleeds, provide reassurance on an improved bleeding protection under 
long-term prophylactic treatment. For the other subject, a certain benefit of prophylactic treatment may 
be inferred from a substantially lower number of BEs requiring VWF-based treatment. However, 
uncertainties remain due to a potential impact of concomitant haemostatic medication and an early 
discontinuation from the study after only 1 month of treatment.  
Furthermore, it was noted that compared to the historical database, results of studies 071301 and 
SHP677-304 appear to indicate a substantial shift towards an increased incidence of major/severe 
bleeding complications (1% of treated spontaneous bleeds in the historical database vs. 11% in study 
071301 and 55% in SHP677-304). However, upon a request for additional information, the MAH clarified 
that the apparent increase in severe BEs was attributed to a single patient, from which no general trend 
towards a higher frequency of more severe breakthrough bleeds can be deduced. Nevertheless, the 
reported case illustrates an apparently only incomplete bleeding protection under prophylactic treatment, 
which remains as an uncertainty. 
Finally, remaining uncertainties relate to the actual severity of baseline bleeding phenotypes of study 
subjects. However, consensus criteria for the initiation of prophylactic treatment in VWD are lacking and 
the entry criteria for Study 071301 provide appropriate support for the assumption of severe disease 
phenotypes with a high probability of benefiting from prophylactic treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
VEYVONDI represents a recombinant VWF. Safety aspects of particular importance to the class of VWF 
products include the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, thrombogenicity and the development of binding 
and/or neutralising alloantibodies. The Risk Management Plan of VEYVONDI describes hypersensitivity 
reactions and thromboembolic events (particularly in patients with low ADAMTS13 levels as well as other 
risk factors, and concomitant overuse of FVIII) as important identified risks whereas inhibitor formation 
remains an important potential risk. 
As of the cut-off date of the interim report of study SHP677-304, no ADRs related to these key risks 
(identified or potential) were observed in the studies submitted with this application. Most TEAEs were 
mild to moderate in severity and were assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug. Five 
subjects experienced 7 TESAEs; these were not fatal or life-threatening, and none of these was 
considered related to VEYVONDI by the investigator or the sponsor. The only TEAE which was considered 
possibly related to VEYVONDI was a single case of moderate headache which occurred in Study 071301 
and led to discontinuation from the study on day 37 of treatment. Noteworthy, this case has already been 
Assessment report  
EMA/505160/2023 
Page 68/71 
 
 
 
 
assessed in a previous variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/004454/II/0026, CHMP positive opinion on 12 
January 2023) and led to the inclusion of headache as a very common ADR in section 4.8 of the 
VEYVONDI SmPC. 
Overall, safety data obtained in the prophylaxis studies (up to 30 Jun 2022, i.e. the cut-off date of the 
interim report of study SHP677-304) are consistent with the known favourable safety profile of VEYVONDI 
in its already approved indications and do not raise concerns about risks specific to its long-term 
prophylactic use in adults with VWD. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties about the reported unfavourable effects arise from the non-controlled design of the 
prophylaxis studies and the relatively small sample size of only 23 unique subjects, which may have been 
too small to detect rare adverse events like e.g. thrombotic events in subjects with known risk factors for 
thrombosis. In addition, the safety database does not include pregnant or lactating women or patients 
with significant renal or liver disease, and the number of subjects aged 65 years and older was too low 
(n=3) to determine whether this age group responds differently compared to younger subjects. However, 
neither the population targeted by the requested EOI nor the maximum amount of vonicog alfa to be 
administered per infusion differs from its already approved indications. Furthermore, based on the 
currently available data, there is no evidence of risks specific to the use of VEYVONDI for long-term 
prophylactic treatment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Favourable effects indicate a clinically meaningful reduction in the rate of treated spontaneous BEs after 
initiation of prophylactic vonicog alfa therapy in adults with severe VWD which may reduce or prevent 
serious complications and sequelae (such as haemophilic-type arthropathy) associated with recurrent 
BEs. 
Safety data submitted with this application were consistent with previous clinical studies of VEYVONDI in 
VWD and did not reveal unfavourable effects specific to the requested EOI. The only reported adverse 
event considered possibly related to the administration of VEYVONDI was a case of non-serious moderate 
headache which occurred in study 071301. Noteworthy this case has already been assessed in a previous 
variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/004454/II/0026), which led to the addition of headache into SmPC 
Assessment report

section 4.8 (CHMP positive opinion on 12 January 2023). Although this event led to a discontinuation of 
treatment, it has not been considered to represent an important identified risk. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the totality of data submitted with this application, the benefits of long-term prophylactic 
treatment with vonicog alfa in adults with severe VWD are considered to outweigh the risks associated 
with such treatment. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of VEYVONDI in long-term prophylactic use in adults is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of indication to include prevention and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in adults 
(age 18 years and older) with von Willebrand disease (VWD), when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment 
alone is ineffective or contraindicated. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2of the SmPC are 
updated. In addition, changes to sections 4.4, 6.2 and 6.6 are made. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 4.1 of the RMP has been accepted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

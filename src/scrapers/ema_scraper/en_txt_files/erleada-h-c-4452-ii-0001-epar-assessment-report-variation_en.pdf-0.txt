Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application is to extend the indication of apalutamide to include treatment of metastatic hormono-
sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) is defined as the absence of evidence of castration 
resistance, defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite castrate levels of testosterone while on 
treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa), or following bilateral 
orchiectomy (J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:1148–59). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 6/104 
  
  
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide with an estimated incidence of 
1.28 million new cases and approximately 359,000 deaths (GLOBOCAN 2018). It is the most common 
non-cutaneous related cancer among men in Europe (EU), United States (US), and Latin 
America/Caribbean comprising approximately 25%, 28%, and 29% of all cancers, respectively (Globocan, 
2012). The incidence is less common in Asian regions (WHO SEARO and WPRO) at less than 6%. In the 
EU and US, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Estimates from European country-specific registries indicate that approximately 15% to 30% of men 
diagnosed with prostate cancer had metastatic (M1) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Metastatic 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) may arise as patients previously diagnosed with localized 
disease go on to develop metastases (M0 at diagnosis), or patients may present with metastases at the 
time of initial diagnosis (M1 at diagnosis). In either case, mCSPC is an incurable disease.  
Treatment aimed at eradicating the primary tumour, typically with surgery or radiation, is unsuccessful in 
~30% of men, who develop recurrent disease that usually manifests first as a rise in plasma prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) followed by metastasis to distant sites (Stephenson AJ, 2005). 
Prognostic factors that influence survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) 
include high prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration at diagnosis, high Gleason score, higher 
primary tumor stage, worse WHO performance status, younger age, and the presence of bone 
metastases. 
2.1.4.  Management 
As mCSPC is dependent on androgen for growth and survival, depriving prostate cancer cells of androgen 
is a primary form of therapy for mCSPC patients. ADT has been the basis for the treatment of patients 
with mHSPC, and results in a median overall survival of 3-4 years. ADT is defined as surgical castration 
by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or 
antagonists (EAU, ESMO, NCCN 2018, Fizazi 2017). The aim of these approaches is to reduce 
testosterone concentrations. Although the majority of mCSPC patients have an initial response to 
treatment with ADT, most men progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer within a median of 
approximately 1 year.  
Treatment options for men with mCSPC have expanded beyond ADT alone. Two studies (STAMPEDE ARM 
C and CHAARTED) provide evidence that combining a short course of docetaxel chemotherapy with ADT 
in mCSPC resulted in prolonged survival compared with treatment with ADT alone. Docetaxel has recently 
been approved in combination with ADT, with or without prednisone or prednisolone, for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (see EPAR docetaxel). Additionally, the 
STAMPEDE ARM G and LATITUDE studies showed that abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone 
(AAP) added to ADT was effective in prolonging overall survival (OS) compared with ADT alone. 
Abiraterone acetate is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see EPAR Zytiga). Both ADT plus docetaxel and ADT plus 
abiraterone/prednisone are recommended by ESMO guideline as first-line treatment of metastatic, 
hormone-naïve disease (ESMO 2015; ESMO eUpdate 2019). 
These therapies are associated with well characterized side effects. Docetaxel is known for 
myelosuppression, especially febrile neutropenia and neuropathy (see SmPC docetaxel). Abiraterone

acetate has the expected on-target mineralocorticoid side effects such as hypertension, peripheral 
oedema and hypokalaemia (see SmPC Zytiga). 
2.1.5.  About the product 
Apalutamide  (JNJ-56021927,  ARN-509)  is  an  orally  administered  androgen  receptor  inhibitor  that  is  a 
selective  antagonist  of  the  androgen  receptor  (AR)  without  significant  agonist  properties.  Apalutamide 
antagonizes  AR  signaling  through  inhibition  of  AR  nuclear  translocation  and  DNA  binding  to  androgen 
response  elements,  a  mechanism  that  is  distinct  from  the  first-generation  anti-androgens  (eg, 
bicalutamide).  Gene  transcription  of  the  androgen-responsive  genes,  prostate-specific  antigen,  and 
transmembrane  protease  serine  2,  is  inhibited  by  apalutamide,  resulting  in  concentration-dependent 
reduction of these protein levels in vitro.  
Apalutamide plus ADT is currently approved for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in adult men (see SmPC section 
4.1).  
The recommended dose is 240 mg (four 60 mg tablets) as an oral single daily dose. Medical castration 
with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) should be continued during treatment in patients 
not surgically castrated (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data were submitted in this application (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  revised  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  submitted  as  part  of  this  application  because  the 
initial ERA presented in the initial MAA was developed to include calculations for Predicted Environmental 
Concentration and risk characterization ratios that were based on the worst case scenarios assuming that 
1%  of  the  population  of  the  EU  received  apalutamide.  Therefore,  any  additional  exposure  anticipated 
resulting from the new indication on mHSPC would already be included in this 1% assumption. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Regarding  the  environmental  risk  assessment,  additional  exposure  anticipated  resulting  from  the  new 
indication on mHSPC would be included in the 1% assumption of the EU population. Based on the current 
environmental risk assessment, no adverse environmental effects are anticipated as a consequence of the 
use of apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer as indicated in the SmPC.   
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The variation to include the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in 
combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for Erleada is approvable from the non-clinical 
point of view. Considering the above data, apalutamide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
In support of this application the MAH provided a population PK and exposure-response analysis based on 
the pivotal Phase 3 study in subjects with mCSPC (Study 3002 [TITAN]), as well as a drug interaction 
study which evaluated the effects of apalutamide on the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of leuprolide (a 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog [GnRHa]) (substudy of Study 3002). 
PK Analytical Methods 
An assay for the determination of apalutamide (JNJ-56021927 or ARN-509) and N-desmethyl apalutamide 
(JNJ-56142060) in human plasma was developed and validated for the previous study [Study 003 
(SPARTAN)] and was used for the current Study 3002 (TITAN). The PK of apalutamide and N-desmethyl 
apalutamide following multiple-dose administration of apalutamide in subjects with prostate cancer were 
thoroughly characterized based on pooled analysis of data from Studies 001, 1010, 1019, and 1020 
provided in the original submission (see SmPC section 5.2 and EPAR Erleada).  
A bioanalytical method was also developed and validated for measurement of leuprolide in human serum 
samples.  
Population PK analysis 
Pooled plots of apalutamide plasma concentrations versus time post the first and latest apalutamide 
administration in study PCR3002 (TITAN) were examined on linear and semilogarithmic scales (Figure 
1).

Figure 1: Observed apalutamide (left) and N-desmethyl apalutamide (right) plasma 
concentrations versus time since first dose on normal scale (upper panels) and logarithmic 
scale (lower panels) 
In total, 2,302 apalutamide and 2,303 N-desmethyl apalutamide plasma concentrations from 501 
subjects with evaluable plasma concentration-time data receiving 240 mg apalutamide each day in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm were used in the population PK analysis. No major differences in these baseline 
characteristics were observed between patients included in study PCR3002 (TITAN) and the subjects 
previously included for the development of the population PK model. 
A previously developed population PK model was used to characterize the apalutamide and N-desmethyl 
apalutamide PK and to determine the individual area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) at steady state based on the post hoc estimates. 
Apalutamide pharmacokinetics were described with an open linear two-compartment disposition model 
with a time-dependent apparent clearance and apparent first-order absorption, quantified by the 
absorption rate constant (ka) after a lag-time (tlag).

Figure 2: Schematic of the reference population pharmacokinetic model for apalutamide and 
N-desmethyl apalutamide 
The population PK model was parameterized in terms of apparent volumes of distribution of the central 
(Vc/F) and peripheral (Vp/F) compartments, apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), and apparent 
total clearance (CLt/F). The CLt/F was composed of a constant, not inducible, clearance (CLni) and 
inducible clearance (CLi0) that increased over time until achieving steady-state (CLiss) after the continuous 
once daily dosing of apalutamide. The inducible clearance was assumed to be concentration independent 
and the time to achieve steady-state was driven by a first-order turnover rate constant (kenz) after a lag-
time needed to initiate the enzyme induction (tenz).

Figure 4: Visual Predictive Check applying the previously developed model to PCR3002 
(TITAN) data for apalutamide (upper panel - a) and N-desmethyl apalutamide (lower panel - 
b) 
The variability in plasma concentrations observed in Study 3002 (TITAN) was slightly lower than the 
model predicted variability, as evidenced by the visual predictive check provided in Figure 4. This 
external evaluation indicated that the apalutamide PK observed in TITAN was similar to that in subjects 
included in the dataset used to develop the population PK model. The summary statistics of individual 
AUC0-24, dose-normalized to 240 mg once daily, were similar to AUC0-24 corrected for the average daily 
dose for rPFS due to the limited number of dose reductions (7.3% of patients in the apalutamide 
treatment arm) observed in the TITAN study. Because patients discontinued treatment upon progression

of disease, average daily dose and AUC0-24, corrected for average daily dose, of OS were similar to those 
of rPFS. In addition, apparent steady-state clearance, apparent steady-state volume, and terminal half-
life at steady state of both apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide in the TITAN study were also 
provided.

Exposure-efficacy 
The exposure-efficacy analysis data contained mesurments from 1,052 patients enrolled in study TITAN, 
of which 525 received apalutamide+ADT and 527 received placebo+ADT. 
The individual AUC0-24 exposure metrics were calculated based on the post hoc estimates using the 
population PK model and adjusted for the individual average daily dose up to the last day of dosing prior 
to the event of interest (rPFS or OS) or censoring date. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
models were used to evaluate the relationships between apalutamide exposure and rPFS or OS, adjusted 
for the stratification factors Gleason score at diagnosis (>7 vs. ≤7), prior docetaxel use (yes vs. no), 
region (Other Countries vs. North America and European Union) and the prognostic factors, which were 
statistically significant from the multivariate Cox regression analysis supportive of the primary analysis. 
The statistically significant prognostic factors for rPFS were the following: Baseline prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA), Baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Baseline age, number of bone lesions at Baseline 
(>10 vs. ≤10), and presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no). The statistically significant prognostic 
factors for OS were Baseline PSA, Baseline LDH, Baseline ECOG PS (1 vs. 0), number of bone lesions at 
Baseline (>10 vs. ≤10), and presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no). In addition, type of ADT (surgical 
castration [ie, bilateral orchiectomy] vs. medical castration [i.e., GnRHa]) was added in the exposure-
response analysis of both rPFS and OS. 
The observed apalutamide exposure levels following the administration of apalutamide 240 mg once daily 
with ADT was shown to be efficacious in extending the rPFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.50; 95% CI: 0.40, 
0.62) and OS (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92) compared with ADT alone. The univariate Kaplan-Meier 
analysis showed that within the relatively narrow investigated exposure range, no statistical association 
could be detected between the dual primary efficacy endpoints (rPFS and OS) and quartiles of 
apalutamide exposure, expressed as steady-state AUC0-24 for the average daily dose (Figure 5). 
A multivariate Cox regression analysis with AUC0-24 as continuous covariate and considering the 
stratification and prognostic factors mentioned above for both rPFS and OS showed the following results: 
rPFS stratified HRAUC0-24=0.997 μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 0.990, 1.004 and OS stratified HRAUC0-24=0.994 
μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 0.986, 1.003.

Exposure-safety 
Data from 1,052 patients (525 apalutamide+ADT and 527 placebo+ADT) enrolled in study TITAN were 
available for the exposure-safety analysis. 
A significantly higher incidence was observed in the apalutamide + ADT treatment arm for skin rash 
(odds ratio [OR]: 3.98; 95% CI: 2.80, 5.77) and pruritus (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.55, 4.18) compared with 
the placebo + ADT arm. Comparable incidence rates were observed in the 2 treatment arms for weight 
decrease, fall, fatigue, and arthralgia. Analogously, the univariate logistic regression showed that skin 
rash (OR: 1.10 x 10 μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.13) and pruritus (OR: 1.06 x 10 μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 1.03, 
1.10), at any grade, had a statistically significant increase in incidence with increasing apalutamide 
exposure expressed as predicted steady-state AUC0-24 for the average daily dose (Figure 6). On the 
contrary, weight decrease, fall, fatigue, and arthralgia did not show a statistically significant increase in 
incidence with increasing apalutamide exposure. When quartiles were examined within the observed 
exposure range, the incidences of skin rash, pruritus, weight decrease, fall, fatigue, and arthralgia per 
quartile were similar. 
Based on the modeled exposure-TEAE relationships, the incidence of skin rash and pruritus was predicted 
for typical exposures expected at doses of 240, 180, and 120 mg once daily (Table 4). For skin rash, a 
decrease in exposure following dose reduction is expected to lower the incidence of these TEAEs in the 
mCSPC population.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  support  of  study  number  56021927PCR3002  (also  referred  to  as  PCR3002  or  TITAN  study)  three 
bioanalytical studies for the determination of apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide and leuprolide in 
human  plasma  were  presented.  In  general,  the  pre-study  validations  of  the  analytical  methods  were 
satisfactory. 
In  study  3002  (TITAN),  a  cross-validation  for  apalutamide  and  N-desmethyl  apalutamide  with  quality 
control samples and with study samples from study 3002 (TITAN), was performed and demonstrated that 
the two methods used have equal performance. 
Incurred Samples Re-assay (ISR) was evaluated by additional analyses on a selection of samples plasma 
for apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide and the other analyte (leuprolide). The results demonstrated 
reproducibility as of the incurred sample repeats met the acceptance criteria. 
The MAH conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial (TITAN) in patients with metastasic hormone sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) including 501 patients divided in two arms: placebo+leuprolide and 
apalutamide+leuoprolide. Several analyses were performed in order to characterize the pharmacokinetics 
of apalutamide when co-administered with leuprolide and the likely interaction on the pharmacokinetics of 
leuprolide. Additionally, exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses were conducted to evaluate the 
effects of apalutamide on the pharmacodynamics of leuprolide.   
Higher exposure of leuprolide (42%) was observed in the apalutamide+leuprolide arm versus 
placebo+leuprolide arm. This was caused by the higher exposure of leuprolide in patients at baseline 
(pre-treatment with apalutamide). Based on the available data, co-administration with apalutamide had 
no apparent effect on the steady-state exposure of leuprolide in mHSPC subjects receiving leuprolide 
acetate (a GnRH analog) (see SmPC section 4.5). 
The population PK model previously developed successfully described the observed data from TITAN 
study. The strategy for external model validation is endorsed. The model slightly over-estimates the 
inter-individual variability, but standard goodness-of-fit (GOF) and numerical predictive check (NPC) plots 
concluded the ability of the model to characterize the apalutamide time-course from TITAN study.  
No exposure-efficacy relationship was established between apalutamide 240 mg once daily with ADT and 
OS or rPFS, which suggest that differences in apalutamide exposure given at the proposed schedule are 
not expected to affect rPFS or OS in patients with mHSPC. The hazard ratio of rPFS (HR=0.5) and OS 
(HR=0.62) was improved when apalutamide was co-administered with leuprolide compared with ADT 
alone.  
The exposure-safety analysis revealed the relationship between apalutamide exposure and skin rash (OR: 
1.10 x 10 μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.13) and pruritus (OR: 1.06 x 10 μg.h/mL; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.10). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 22/104 
  
  
 
Higher incidence was also observed in the apalutamide+ADT arm versus placebo+ADT arm for skin rash 
and pruritus. A lack of relationship was demonstrated between apalutamide+leuprolide arm and 
apalutamide+other ADT agents. Therefore, safety concerns might not be related to the co-administration 
of apalutamide+leuprolide in patients.  
No new pharmacodynamic studies were provided which is considered acceptable. The effect of 
apalutamide on the QTc interval was thoroughly evaluated in 45 subjects with CRPC in a dedicated QT 
study (Study 1019) submitted in the original application. Following 240 mg once daily dosing of 
apalutamide to steady state, the largest change in QT interval corrected with Fridericia’s formula (ΔQTcF) 
was 12.4 msec and the upper bound of its associated 90% CI was 16.0 msec. Across all timepoints the 
ΔQTcF and upper bounds of their associated 90% CIs were below the threshold of 20 msec for an 
anticancer agent. 
In Study 3002 (TITAN), there were no adverse events associated with ventricular arrhythmias such as 
QTc prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, or torsade de pointes reported in either treatment arm. Other 
adverse events which may be associated with QT prolongation were similar between treatments arms; 
these include syncope and loss of consciousness (combined incidence of both terms was 1.0% in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.9% in the placebo + ADT arm), as well as sudden death, sudden cardiac 
death, cardiorespiratory arrest, and ventricular fibrillation (combined incidence of all 4 terms was 0.6% in 
the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.4% in the placebo + ADT arm (see clinical safety) . 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of apalutamide when co-administered with leuprolide in patients with 
metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer has been adequately characterized with pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic data from the phase 3 (TITAN) clinical trial. All results from the present 
combination therapy are in line with the results obtained by the initial application for apalutamide in non-
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study

Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the apalutamide (240 mg once daily) + ADT arm or matching 
placebo + ADT arm. Apalutamide, 240 mg daily (4 x 60 mg tablets), or matching placebo (4 tablets) was 
to be taken orally once daily on a continuous dosing regimen. A cycle of treatment was defined as 28 
days. If the subject had radiographic progression without clinical progression and alternate therapy was 
not initiated, treatment could continue until clinical progression was observed; patients were required to 
discontinue study drug with documented clinical progression based on protocol-specified criteria. 
After discontinuation of study drug, patients had an End-of-Treatment Visit within 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. 
All patients who did not undergo surgical castration, received and remained on a stable regimen of ADT. 
The choice of the GnRHa (agonist or antagonist) was at the discretion of the Investigator. Dosing (dose 
and frequency of administration) was consistent with the prescribing information.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine if the addition of apalutamide to ADT provides superior efficacy in 
improving overall survival (OS) or radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) for patients with mCSPC. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate clinically relevant improvements with addition of apalutamide to 
ADT including the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy, and delays in pain progression, opioid use for 
prostate cancer, and skeletal-related events (SREs); to characterize the safety of adding apalutamide to 
ADT in patients with mCSPC; to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of apalutamide; to evaluate the concentration of leuprolide and assess the PD 
effect of leuprolide on testosterone concentrations when used alone or in combination with apalutamide; 
and to evaluate the treatment effectiveness with the addition of apalutamide to ADT for the 
subpopulations of patients with low-volume or high-volume mCSPC. 
Other Objectives included: to evaluate exploratory biomarkers predictive of response and resistance to 
treatment;  To evaluate patient relevant outcomes including symptoms (ie, pain, fatigue, urination) and 
function (ie, physical, emotional, social) and health-related quality of life; To evaluate improvements in 
other clinically relevant endpoints with the addition of apalutamide to ADT.

•  Change from baseline over time in each of the subscales of FACT-P, EQ-5D-5L VAS, BPI-SF 
interference subscale and BFI: 
PRO data for the BPI-SF and BFI were collected for seven days at baseline and every cycle 
through the end of treatment. The FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L were completed for one day (the last 
day of the 7 days the BPI-SF and BFI were collected) every cycle from baseline to Cycle 7, and 
then every 2 months thereafter until end of treatment. All PROs were collected, in the same way, 
during the Follow-up Phase at Months 4, 8 and 12. 
Sample size 
An overall type I error of 5% was planned for this study. This study utilizes the dual-primary endpoints of 
rPFS and OS with a 0.005 level of significance allocated for the rPFS endpoint and 0.045 allocated for OS. 
The study was considered a success if at least one of the dual-primary endpoints was statistically 
significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 27/104 
  
  
It was assumed that the failure distribution of the dual-primary endpoint, rPFS, follows an exponential 
distribution with a constant hazard rate. It was estimated that approximately 368 rPFS events would be 
required to provide at least 85% power in detecting an HR of 0.67 (median rPFS of 20 months for the 
control group [ADT] versus 30 months for the treatment group of apalutamide plus ADT) at a 2-tailed 
significance level of 0.005. The assumption of 20 months for the control group was an estimate based on 
published data (Gravis 2013, James 2016, Sweeney 2015). The study would also provide sufficient power 
(approximately 80%) to detect an HR of 0.75 in the dual-primary endpoint of OS based on an assumed 
OS median of 44 months (Gravis 2013, Sweeney 2015) for the control group (ADT) (i.e., 44 months 
versus 59 months). Approximately 410 death events were required for the final analysis to detect the 
assumed HR at a 2-tailed significance level of 0.045 with an enrollment duration of approximately 30 
months (approximately 1,000 patients). The total study duration was estimated to be approximately 54 
months to obtain 410 deaths. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive apalutamide plus ADT or placebo plus ADT. Patients 
were stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis (≤7 versus >7), region (North America [NA] and European 
Union [EU] versus Other Countries), and prior docetaxel use (Yes versus No). The randomization was 
balanced by using randomly permuted blocks. The interactive web response system (IWRS) assigned a 
unique treatment code, which dictated the treatment assignment and matching study drug kit for each 
subject. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  
All patients and study team members associated with the study conduct were to remain blinded to treatment 
group assignment until the study is unblinded. Unblinding was allowed in the case of a safety or a medical 
emergency, or for conducting data review by the IDMC as outlined in the IDMC Charter. Unblinding was 
also  possible  after  the  subject  discontinues  from  the  Treatment  Phase  of  study  because  of  radiographic 
progression and the investigator felt this information is essential to determine the next course of therapy. 
Unblinding a subject for this situation was only possible after discussion with the sponsor’s medical officer. 
Patients who have had their treatment assignment unblinded were discontinued from the Treatment Phase 
and entered in the Follow-up Phase.  
Statistical methods 
The ITT population includes all randomized patients and are classified according to their assigned 
treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received. Subject disposition and efficacy analyses 
are performed on data from the ITT population. 
The safety population includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The PRO population 
includes randomized subjects who have completed at least the baseline assessment of BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-
P or EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. 
Kaplan-Meier product limit method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the time-
to-event variables and to obtain the hazard ratio (HR) along with the associated confidence intervals 
(CIs). Unless otherwise specified, stratified log-rank test was used to test the treatment effect for time-
to-event variables. A subject without an event at the time of analysis was censored at the last known 
date the subject did not have an event. Subgroup analysis was performed based on data from patients

with low volume and those with high volume mCSPC. High volume mCSPC is defined as 1) visceral 
metastases and at least 1 bone lesion or 2) at least 4 bone lesions, with at least 1 bone lesion outside of 
the vertebral column or pelvis. Low volume mCSPC is defined as the presence of bone lesion(s) not 
meeting the definition of high volume mCSPC. 
The dual-primary efficacy endpoints for the TITAN study were rPFS and OS. In general, a two-sided 
significance level of α = 0.05 was used for all hypothesis testing and all CIs were calculated using the 
two-sided 95% confidence level, unless otherwise specified. For rPFS and OS the testing used the 
Fallback Method (Wiens 2005). The rPFS endpoint was tested first at the two-sided 0.005 level of 
significance. If rPFS was not statistically significant, the OS endpoint was to be tested at the two-sided 
0.045 level of significance; if rPFS was statistically significant, the OS endpoint was to be tested at the 
two-sided 0.05 level of significance.  
Radiographic progressive disease 
Radiographic progressive disease is defined as one of the following: 
1. Progression of soft tissue lesions measured by CT or MRI as defined by modified RECIST 1.1. 
2. A patient was considered to have radiographic progression by bone scan if: 
- 
Patients who were observed to have ≥2 new bone lesions on the Cycle 3 bone scan 
compared with the baseline bone scan had a confirmatory bone scan performed at ≥6 
weeks later and their scans were subjected to the 2+2 rule as follows: Patients with a 
confirmatory scan that showed ≥2 new bone lesions compared with the Cycle 3 bone scan 
(ie, at least 4 new lesions compared with the baseline bone scan) were considered to 
have radiographic progression by bone scan. The date of progression was the date of the 
Cycle 3 bone scan; Patients whose confirmatory scan did not show ≥2 new bone lesions 
compared with the Cycle 3 bone scan were not considered to have radiographic 
progression by bone scan. In order to be considered to have radiographic progression by 
bone scan, these patients had to have a subsequent bone scan with observation of ≥2 
new bone lesions compared with the Cycle 3 bone scan. The date of progression would be 
the date of the first subsequent bone scan with ≥2 new bone lesions compared with the 
Cycle 3 bone scan. 
- 
Patients whose Cycle 3 bone scan did not show ≥2 new bone lesions compared with 
baseline bone scan did not have a confirmatory bone scan performed and were not 
considered to have radiographic progression by bone scan at that time. In order to be 
considered to have radiographic progression by bone scan, these patients had to have a 
subsequent bone scan with ≥2 new bone lesions compared with the baseline bone scan. 
Radiographic progression-free survival data for patients with no evidence of radiographic progressive 
disease was censored on the date of the last tumour assessment (or, if no tumour assessment was 
performed after the baseline visit, at the date of randomization).

The progression of soft tissue lesions was measured by CT or MRI as defined by modified RECIST 1.1. 
The primary analysis compared the rPFS distributions in the 2 treatment groups using a two-sided log-
rank test, stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis (≤7 vs. >7), region (NA, EU, vs. other countries), and 
prior docetaxel use (Yes vs. No) at the 0.005 significance level. At the time of primary analysis of rPFS it 
was projected that approximately 50% of the total number of required events for the OS analysis would 
be observed. Stratified Cox proportional-hazard model was used to obtain the HR and its 95% CI. Non-
stratified log rank test was performed as a sensitivity analysis. 
To assess the consistency of treatment benefit with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint of rPFS 
across important subgroups. The comparison between the two treatment groups was evaluated using the 
hazard ratio with its 95% CI from a univariate Cox regression model in each subgroup. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for important selected prognostic factors, were performed 
as supportive analysis, as appropriate. The adjusted hazard ratio and its 95% CI for treatment and each 
factor are provided. The following baseline covariates were considered for inclusion in the model: PSA, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, pain at baseline, age, ECOG PS grade (0 
vs. 1), number of bone lesions at baseline (≤10 vs. >10), presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no), 
receipt of localized therapy (yes vs. no), geographic region (NA/EU vs. other countries), gleason score 
(≤7 vs. >7) and prior docetaxel use (yes vs. no). 
Note: To evaluate the lack of bias in the investigator’s assessment of rPFS, an audit plan was 
implemented. The primary audit plan utilizes the method proposed by Dodd (NCI method). The audit plan 
was implemented as a supportive plan. All scans were collected in a central location for blinded 
independent review. Stratified simple random sampling was used to make sure the sample was truly 
representative of the entire population. Six-hundred (~60%) patients were randomly selected for the 
blinded independent central review (BICR) review before unblinding, stratified by the same factors used 
for stratified randomization: Gleason score at diagnosis, prior docetaxel use, and geographic region. 
Overall survival 
For the dual-primary OS endpoint, 2 interim analyses are planned for this study after observing 
approximately 50% (~205 events) and approximately 70% (~287 events) of the total number of required 
(410) events. At the time of the first interim analysis of OS, the final analysis of the rPFS dual-primary 
endpoint will also be performed. The primary analysis for the comparison of the OS distributions between 
the two treatment groups was carried out using the stratified log rank test at a two-sided overall 
significance level of 0.05 after rPFS achieved the statistical significance at 0.005 level. A pre-specified 
Wang-Tsiatis power boundaries characterized by a shape parameter of 0.2 was used for the interim 
analysis of OS. The analysis methods for OS were similar to those for rPFS. In addition, 6-month, 12-
month, 24-month, and 36-month survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Subgroup analyses on patients with low or high volume mCSPC disease were performed without alpha 
spending assigned without adjustment for multiplicity. Sensitivity analyses could also be conducted.

The general hypothesis used to address the primary objective was as follows: 
H0: The survival distributions (rPFS or OS) of the experimental group (apalutamide + ADT) SE(t), and 
that of the control group (placebo + ADT), SC(t), are equal: 
SE(t) = SC(t), for all t > 0 
H1: The survival distributions (rPFS or OS) are not equal: 
SE(t) ≠ S(t), for some t > 0 
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The statistical testing of the secondary endpoints was performed by at the time of the first interim 
analysis using fixed sequence testing according to the following pre-specified order considering clinical 
importance and data maturity: time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to pain progression, 
time to chronic opioid use, time to SRE. This procedure controls the overall level of significance at the 2-
tailed, with α set at 0.05.

Recruitment 
Enrolment of approximately 1,000 patients was planned for this study. From 1545 patients assessed for 
eligibility a total of 1052 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (525 patients to the apalutamide 
+ ADT arm and 527 patients to the placebo + ADT arm) and comprise the ITT (intent-to treat) 
population. One subject was assigned to the apalutamide + ADT arm but withdrew consent prior to 
treatment, resulting in 1051 patients in the safety population. The first subject signed informed consent 
on 9 December 2015 and the last subject signed informed consent on 29 June 2017.  
Twenty-three countries and 260 sites participated in the study. The clinical cut-off (CCO) date for this 
report was 23 November 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were 4 amendments to the original protocol, dated 24 June 2015. Major changes to the conduct of 
the study are described in the following table.

Page 32/104 
  
  
 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were recorded for 9.3% of patients overall, and were mostly deviations from entry 
criteria. Slightly more patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm (6.5%) did not satisfy all entry criteria 
compared with the placebo + ADT arm (4.2%). The most common eligibility violations in both treatment 
arms were due to ADT not started within the required time frame (15 patients total, 1.4%) or prior 
therapies for localized prostate cancer not stopped in time per protocol (9 patients total, 0.9%). 
Deviations in the “Other” category included patients whose treatment was unblinded without Sponsor 
consultation, or patients missing efficacy assessments. 
Three patients had their study treatment discontinued due to protocol deviations. The remaining 
deviations were considered by the sponsor unlikely to influence the interpretation of study results or pose 
a safety risk to the patients.

Patients were considered to be castration sensitive based upon a short length of time of prior treatment 
with ADT as well as the fact that >90% of patients in both arms had a decrease in PSA following initiation 
of ADT which was still observed at the start of study treatment.

Prior prostate cancer therapies 
Table 10: Prior Prostate Cancer Therapy; Intent-to-treat Population (Study 56021927PCR3002) 
Prior docetaxel was received by 11% of patients, 58 patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 55 
patients in the placebo + ADT arm. These patients were required to have maintained a response to 
docetaxel of stable disease or better prior to randomization in the study. All patients were informed about 
the survival benefit of docetaxel for the mCSPC setting but deferred docetaxel either because the 
investigator did not feel that docetaxel was standard of care (SOC) (65%) or the patient refused 
docetaxel therapy (12%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 36/104 
  
  
 
 
 
Among patients with prior docetaxel treatment, there were a higher proportion of patients in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm with negative prognostic features (e.g., higher ECOG score [1 vs 0] and presence 
of visceral disease): 35% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm compared to 27% of patients in the 
placebo + ADT arm had an ECOG score of 1; 16% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm compared to 
11% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm had presence of visceral disease. Additionally, patients with 
prior docetaxel treatment in the apalutamide + ADT arm had a higher median PSA at baseline (0.93 ug/L, 
apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.57 ug/L, placebo + ADT arm) as well as higher mean alkaline phosphatase 
values at baseline (120 U/L, apalutamide + ADT arm and 95 U/L, placebo + ADT arm). 
All patients had received hormonal therapy prior to randomization, usually a combination of anti-
androgens and GnRH agonists. Most patients (71%) had received prior ADT for mCSPC for 3 months or 
less prior to randomization; the median length of time from initiation of ADT for mCSPC to randomization 
was 1.8 months. Two patients were documented as major protocol deviations with time from initiation of 
ADT to randomization of 105 months. Few patients (5.2%) received ADT in the localized setting. 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population of 1052 patients (525 patients in the apalutamide + 
ADT arm and 527 patients in the placebo + ADT arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Dual Primary endpoints 
Overall survival 
A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated in patients randomised to receive 
apalutamide compared with patients randomised to receive placebo. The HR for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 
0.51, 0.89; p=0.0053), representing a 33% reduction in the risk of death for patients in the apalutamide 
+ ADT arm compared with the placebo + ADT arm. The pre-specified alpha boundary of 0.0101 (Wang-
Tsiatis power boundary with a shape parameter of 0.2) for this interim analysis (at approximately 50% 
OS events) was crossed. Median OS follow-up was approximately 22 months in both groups.

A non-stratified log rank test of OS was performed as a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis 
confirmed that treatment with apalutamide + ADT significantly prolonged OS compared with placebo + 
ADT (HR=0.68; 95%CI: 0.51, 0.90. p=0.0061).

Radiographic Progression-free Survival 
A statistically significant improvement in rPFS was demonstrated in patients randomised to receive 
Erleada compared with patients randomised to receive placebo. The HR for rPFS was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39, 
0.60; p<0.0001), representing a 52% reduction in the risk of radiographic progression or death for 
patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm compared with the placebo + ADT arm. The alpha boundary of 
0.005 was crossed.

Blinded independent central review (BICR) of radiographic progression was conducted in a randomly 
selected sample consisting of approximately 60% of patients in the study. The result of this subgroup 
analysis of rPFS by BICR was highly significant (p<0.0001) in favour of apalutamide. The primary audit 
analysis by the NCI method confirmed the investigator assessment. Furthermore, audit analysis also 
confirmed no investigator bias and the validity of the investigator results.

For the purpose of sensitivity analysis only, a nadir bone scan was determined for each subject. A nadir 
bone scan was defined as the scan with the least visible evidence of disease based on the reviewers’ 
judgement. Nadir scans were independently selected by the central reviewers as well as by investigators. 
The timepoint of the nadir scan was used to define a new baseline from which bone metastasis 
progression (≥2 new lesions) on subsequent bone scans were determined.

Secondary endpoints 
The analyses of secondary endpoints were ordered according to the hierarchical testing sequence as 
prespecified in the SAP. Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was highly statistically significant. Time to pain 
progression was then tested but did not cross the boundary. As a result, the rest of the secondary 
endpoints were not formally tested, and only nominal p-values are provided. 
Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy 
Treatment with Erleada statistically significantly delayed the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (HR = 
0.391, CI = 0.274, 0.558; p < 0.0001), resulting in a 61% reduction of risk for subjects in the treatment 
arm compared to the placebo arm. 
Of the patients who received subsequent chemotherapy, 89/100 patients in the placebo + ADT arm and 
37/44 patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm received docetaxel. Most of these (67/89 patients in the 
placebo + ADT arm and 29/37 patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm) received docetaxel as the first 
systemic therapy for prostate cancer following discontinuation of study treatment (see Table 23).

Natural opium alkaloids were taken by 11% of patients during the study (1.8% prior to study entry), 
other opioids by 11% (3% prior to study entry) and opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesics by 
10% (2.3% prior to study entry).

recorded in the placebo + ADT arm. Median time to skeletal-related events, favored treatment with 
apalutamide + ADT (HR=0.798, 95%CI: 0.555, 1.149). Nominal p value was 0.2246.

Best overall response (exploratory post-hoc analysis) 
Complete response, based on modified RECIST criteria assessing visceral, soft tissue, and lymph nodes, 
was 27% in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 19% in the placebo + ADT arm. Responders, including 
complete or partial responses, were 72% and 64%, respectively.

PRO analyses 
The cumulative compliance rate was similar between treatment arms for the completion of the BPI-SF 
and BFI, with greater than 96% through Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, the cumulative compliance rate was 
generally within 90% or greater for cycles associated with a clinic visit. Lower compliance was observed 
for cycles completed at home without a clinic visit (ranging from 75% to 85%).

Cumulative compliance rate for the FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L, completed one time per cycle visit, was 
generally similar between treatment groups. From baseline through Cycle 13, the compliance rate ranged 
from 75% to 85%. After Cycle 13, compliance for the majority of visits were within the range of 80%. 
Compliance rates in the Follow-up Phase were lower for all PROs in both treatment groups. For BPI and 
BFI overall compliance was 49% at Month 4, 42% at Month 8 and 30% at Month 12. For FACT-P and EQ-
5D-5L overall compliance was 32% at Month 4, 32% at Month 8, and 20% at Month 12. 
Assessment of the PRO data from TITAN showed that patients entering this study were relatively 
asymptomatic, with low median pain and fatigue intensity at baseline. Pain and fatigue levels as well as 
pain interference and fatigue interference remained similar between treatment groups throughout the 
treatment phase. Post-hoc analysis of the proportion of responses to the pain intensity item showed that 
the majority of the patients’ pain intensity scores remained stable or improved. 
There were no changes from baseline in the FACT-P in the apalutamide + ADT treatment arm (cycle 25, 
LS Means 0.50) and no differences compared to ADT (p=0.2367). There were no statistically significant 
differences observed between treatment groups for the FACT-P overall, or the EQ5D-5L. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subsequent therapy 
Of patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason and were still alive, more patients in the 
placebo + ADT arm (73%) received subsequent therapy for prostate cancer compared with the 
apalutamide + ADT arm (54%). Of patients who discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease 
and were still alive, 78% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm and 70% of patients in the apalutamide + 
ADT arm received subsequent therapy for prostate cancer.

Additional analyses were done to evaluate the OS and rPFS for high and low-risk patients from the TITAN 
study. High-risk was defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) Gleason score of ≥8; 
(2) presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) (3) presence of measurable visceral (excluding lymph 
node disease) metastasis on CT or MRI scan (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria).

Prognosis factors 
Overall survival 
After adjusting for multiple covariates, treatment with apalutamide + ADT remained highly statistically 
significant and consistent with the primary OS analysis results, with a 38% reduction in risk of death 
compared with placebo + ADT (HR=0.617; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.83; p=0.0016).

The prognostic characteristics that appeared to influence OS at the p<0.05 level, in order from most 
effect to least, regardless of treatment group were: LDH, presence of visceral disease, number of bone 
lesions, PSA, and ECOG grade. Prior docetaxel treatment and age did not impact OS. Increased PSA and 
LDH are associated with decreased OS. Absence of baseline visceral disease and number of bone lesion 
(≤10) were associated with better OS.

rPFS 
After adjusting for multiple covariates, treatment with apalutamide + ADT remained highly statistically 
significant and consistent with the primary rPFS analysis results; with a 57% reduction in risk compared 
with placebo + ADT (HR=0.432; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.54; p-value <0.0001). Prognostic characteristics that 
appeared to influence rPFS at the p<0.05 level, regardless of treatment group were: LDH, presence of 
visceral disease, number of bone lesions, PSA, and age. Elevated PSA and LDH were associated with 
decreased rPFS. The absence of visceral disease, fewer bone lesions (≤10), and younger age were 
associated with improved rPFS.

Notes: The statistical testing of the secondary endpoints was performed by at the time of the first interim analysis 
using fixed sequence testing according to the following pre-specified order: time to initiation of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, time to pain progression, time to chronic opioid use, time to SRE. Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was 
statistically significant. Time to pain progression was then tested but did not cross the boundary. As a result, the rest 
of the secondary endpoints were not formally tested, and only nominal p-values are provided.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The posology of apalutamide for the proposed indication (mCSPC) is in line with the currently approved 
indication (NM-CRPC) which was considered acceptable by the CHMP, since a positive benefit risk balance 
was agreed in the same disease. 
The MAH presented results from study 56029127PCR3002 (TITAN), a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind study of apalutamide plus ADT versus ADT alone in 1,051 patients with mHSPC. 
Study participants were eligible if there was a diagnosis (newly or previously diagnosed) of prostate 
adenocarcinoma as confirmed by the investigator and had metastatic disease with at least ≥1 bone 
lesion(s). Patients with lymph nodes or visceral metastases as the only sites of metastases were excluded 
from the trial. No patients with ECOG 2 or prior therapy with new hormonal treatments (abiraterone and 
enzalutamide) were allowed. On the contrary, prior docetaxel treatment was permitted provided only a 
maximum of 6 cycles was administered. The latter is following the findings from the CHAARTED trial. In 
this regard, both patients with high and low volume disease could be recruited in the TITAN study. High-
volume mHSPC was correctly defined as 1) visceral metastases and at least 1 bone lesion or 2) at least 4 
bone lesions, with at least 1 bone lesion outside of the vertebral column or pelvis. Low-volume mHSPC is 
defined as the presence of bone lesion(s) not meeting the definition of high-volume mHSPC. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the apalutamide (240 mg once daily) + ADT arm or matching 
placebo + ADT arm. Even if the design of this study was supported by the CHMP scientific advice given to 
the MAH (EMEA/H/SAH/031/1/2014/II), it would have been desirable and much more informative to use 
docetaxel as comparator, especially since Docetaxel’s results were publicly available in 2014 (ASCO, 
NEJM). 
Both, rPFS and OS were included as dual primary endpoints, which means either rPFS or OS positive 
results are enough to declare the success of the trial. Regarding the scanning frequency for rPFS, 
radiographic scans were obtained at screening (within 6 weeks prior to randomization), start of Cycle 3 
(Week 8), Cycle 5 (Week 16), and then every 4 cycles (16 weeks) thereafter. However, gonadotropin 
hormone releasing analogs when first initiated may stimulate a bone flare response, which could be taken 
like tumor progression (false positive). In order to disentangle the tumour flare driven by ADT from a true 
bone progression, radiographic disease progression on bone scans within the first 12 weeks on study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 58/104 
  
  
required the appearance of ≥2 new lesions not consistent with tumour flare and was to be confirmed on a 
second bone scan ≥6 weeks later that shows a minimum of ≥2 additional new lesions. 
Secondary endpoints included time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to pain progression, time 
to chronic opioid use, time to Skeletal-related event which are considered relevant and acceptable. 
Patients were stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis (≤7 versus >7), region (North America [NA] and 
European Union [EU] versus Other Countries), and prior docetaxel use (Yes versus No). Gleason score 
and prior docetaxel use are deemed to be important prognostic factors and therefore rightly chosen as 
stratification factors. 
Overall, the statistical methods are deemed appropriate, with ITT as the primary analysis population. 
Importantly, as per the SAP, the statistical testing of the secondary endpoints was to be performed by 
using fixed sequence testing according to the following pre-specified order considering clinical importance 
and data maturity: time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to pain progression, time to chronic 
opioid use, time to SRE. 
The strategies to maintain the study integrity with regards to the randomization codes was discussed. 
According to applicant’s justification, the integrity of randomization codes was kept. Before the unblinding 
of the study team (28 January 2019), 15 patients were unblinded at the request of the Investigator. In 
accordance with Section 5 of the Protocol these were done after the patients had achieved rPFS and met 
criteria for withdrawal. None of the patients were unblinded to resolve an urgent safety event, they were 
unblinded to obtain information to inform subsequent treatment. 
The final SAP (version 1.0) was approved on 10 January 2019, prior to the final database lock or data 
extraction (14 January 2019) but after the clinical data cut-off (23 November 2018, when the required 
number of events for the interim OS analysis had occurred). According to applicant’s justification, a draft 
SAP had been available since 22 August 2016 and was updated with study amendments as appropriate. 
However, it is not fully understood why an initial version 1.0 was not approved on 22 August 2016 and 
the rest of versions following the study amendments with impact on the SAP. In any case, the potential 
impact on results is expected to be limited.  
There were 4 amendments to the original protocol. The first amendment changed part of the inclusion 
criteria, allowing the inclusion of patients with high volume disease and removing those with ECOG 2. The 
former is understood. However, the exclusion of patients with a poorer performance status is only 
understood with the aim of improving the size of benefits. No clinical arguments can be identified. 
It is noted that the interim analyses for OS were changed: from 50% initially to 60% and then in the 
amendment 4, again to 50%, but modifying the second from 75% to 70%. According to the MAH, the 
basis for these changes was the knowledge of external data relating to this population and time of the 
primary analysis for rPFS. 
There were protocol deviations in approximately 10% of the patients. However, they are not considered 
critical. 
Regarding the baseline characteristics, the population seems to be evenly balanced, even though only 
11% of the ITT population previously received chemotherapy despite the majority of the population 
recruited could be considered fit for receiving docetaxel (good ECOG and high volume disease). 
The demographic characteristics at baseline outline a population with metastatic disease at initial 
diagnosis, Gleason score >7, older than 65 and with no or slight pain. 
At randomisation most of the patients had had any decline in the PSA value (95.6% in the apalutamide 
arm and 80.6% in the placebo arm) with more than half of the patients reaching a reduction of 50% or 
more in the PSA value (93% vs. 58.8%, apalutamide and placebo, respectively). However, there were 64 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 59/104 
  
  
(6%) patients (31 in the apalutamide arm and 33 in the placebo arm) without a reduction in PSA value at 
the time of randomisation that might be considered as potential castration resistant. Due to the small 
number of patients (6%) and the fact that they seem to be evenly balanced, the impact of this issue is 
deemed minor. The SmPC reflects that, although criteria for castration resistance were not determined at 
baseline, 94% of patients demonstrated a decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) from initiation of 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to first dose of apalutamide or placebo (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed data from the 23 November 2018 clinical 
cut-off date for TITAN and unanimously recommended to unblind the study and offer patients assigned to 
the placebo + ADT arm an option to crossover to receive apalutamide + ADT.  
As specified in the statistical plan, the rPFS endpoint was tested first at the two-sided 0.005 level of 
significance. Since rPFS was statistically significant, the OS endpoint was tested at the overall 0.05 level 
of significance. The interim analysis for OS was conducted when 200 patients had died (48.8% of the 410 
planned final events). According to interim plan the alpha boundary of 0.0101 (Wang-Tsiatis power 
boundary with a shape parameter of 0.2) was crossed: HR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.89; p=0.0053), and 
thus, OS was statistically significant. With regards to this effect estimation, it is noted that the calculated 
95%CI were not corrected as planned. The Applicant provided the confidence intervals for the HR with the 
appropriate corrected confidence level according to the interim plan (i.e. 98.99%): HR: 0.67 (98.99% CI: 
0.46, 0.97)  
The  OS  sensitivity  analyses  carried  out  point  out  in  the  same  direction  (non-stratified  log  rank  test; 
HR=0.68;  95%CI:  0.51,  0.90  and  Multivariate  analysis  of  OS  adjusting  for  baseline  prognostic  factors 
HR=0.617; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.83). To assess the impact of the use of subsequent therapies on the treatment 
effect  on  the  OS,  a  time-dependent  analysis  using  Cox  regression  using  inverse  probability  censoring 
weighting (IPCW) was conducted: HR=0.483(95% CI: 0.360, 0.647). In this last analysis, only potential 
impact of subsequent therapies was analysed. It should be kept in mind that this study was still blinded 
when data for the interim OS analysis was locked, and no patients from the placebo arm had crossed over 
to the apalutamide arm. When the IDMC recommended unblinding the study, 243 patients in the placebo 
group  were  offered  the  opportunity  to  receive  apalutamide.  As  of  04  October  2019,  202  patients  have 
crossed over to the apalutamide arm. The potential impact on OS of patients who continued treatment after 
radiographic progression, especially in patients randomised to the placebo arm, was not controlled in this 
analysis.  Further  sensitivity  analyses  (i)censoring  patients  who  continued  treatment  in  placebo  arm,  ii) 
patients who continued treatment in apalutamide arm and iii) patients who continued treatment in both 
arms were submitted (data not shown). As the results of these analyses were similar to the primary OS 
analysis,  the  impact  on  OS  of  patient  who  continued  treatment  after  radiographic  progression  was 
considered limited. 
Regarding the subsequent therapies, apart from the previous IPCW analysis, 92 (51.1%) patients in the 
apalutamide arm and 197 (72.7%) patients in the placebo arm received subsequent therapy for prostate 
cancer,  which  may  include  radiotherapy,  surgery  and/or  systemic  therapy  (i.e.,  hormonal  therapy, 
chemotherapy). Among patients who discontinued treatment and were still alive, the proportion of patients 
that received subsequent hormonal therapy or chemotherapy was roughly similar. 
Most of the OS subgroups analysed support the ITT analysis. The treatment effect observed was generally 
consistent in the subgroups evaluated, including high volume disease (HR=0.68) and low volume disease 
(HR=0.67). Only in the prior docetaxel group there seems to be an apparent lack of benefit with the point 
estimate beyond unity. However, due to the very low number of events, this result should be interpreted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 60/104 
  
  
carefully. The applicant has tried to justify this discrepancy by the baseline characteristics, which were 
not balanced within this subgroup (PSA and ECOG).  
While the statistical significance in OS was reached, the number of deaths was only <50% of the total 
planned events and more importantly, the median follow-up was only approximately 22 months in both 
groups. It is noted that the plan tried to detect an increase in the median OS from 44 in the control arm 
to 59 months in the apalutamide arm. However, due to the interim study termination a number of 
patients were censored (852, 81%), many of them in the first part of the curve. More importantly, the 
study has substantially less follow-up than planned. 
Even considering the interim termination of the trial, the high amount and in particular the early 
distribution in time of the censored data was not fully understood. Description and discussion on the 
reasons for censoring were provided. The applicant justified that the last patient was consented on 
29 June 2017, but the last patient was randomized on 25 July 2017 or 16 months before the clinical cut-
off. There was only 1 subject in each arm that was at risk and censored prior to 15 months and 
87 patients who were at risk and censored during month 15 to 18 (placebo=48; apalutamide=39), in 
addition there were only 13 placebo and 15 apalutamide patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew 
from the study by month 18.  
Overall, the available data for OS appear to be insufficiently mature. The applicant states that an updated 
OS analysis is planned when approximately 410 events have been observed which is expected to be 
available by June 2021. However, the significance of OS will not be re-tested in this analysis. It should 
also be considered that around 91% of patients randomised to the placebo arm had crossed over to 
apalutamide, which can make more difficult to establish the contribution of apalutamide on OS. 
Nevertheless, the MAH is recommended to submit the updated and final OS analyses from the Phase 3 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study 56029127PCR3002 (TITAN). This is expected to be 
available in June 2021.  
On analysing the results in rPFS, the improvement in rPFS was consistently shown in the sensitivity 
analyses (based on the central review data, where the date of progression is defined as the date of the 
scan showing >=2 new bone lesions compared to the nadir of bone lesions) and in the central review in 
approximately 60% of patients. Regarding the subgroup analyses, there is no indication of any discordant 
subgroup. However, a higher number of patients in the experimental arm discontinued treatment by cut-
off date (39 [7.4%] vs. 11 [2.1%]). The main reason for discontinuation for those patients who did not 
have a radiographic progression event but had discontinued study treatment was an adverse event in 
both arms (45.5% in placebo vs 56.4% in apalutamide).  
Overall, consistent improvement in rPFS was observed across patient subgroups including high- or low-
volume disease, prior docetaxel use (yes or no), age (< 65, ≥65, or ≥75 years old), baseline PSA above 
median (yes or no), and number of bone lesions (≤10 or >10). 
Results on the secondary endpoints were tested according to the hierarchical plan, showing only positive 
findings for the first one (time to cytotoxic chemotherapy) and therefore stopping the analysis for the 
others. Time to pain progression, time to chronic opioid use, time to skeletal-related events had a 
positive trend favouring the apalutamide arm (according to the nominal p values). 
Regarding other efficacy endpoints, there was a longer delay in the time to PSA progression and in terms 
of PFS2 for those patients treated with apalutamide vs placebo. The antitumor activity according to 
RECIST criteria in visceral, soft tissue and lymph nodes was 72% in the apalutamide+ADT vs 64% in the 
placebo+ADT arm. Death from a prostate cancer-specific cause showed a positive trend in favour of 
apalutamide + ADT (HR=0.74; 95%CI 0.53, 1.03). The PRO analyses did not reveal differences between 
the two arms of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 61/104 
  
  
Overall, the results from the study are considered clinically meaningful, both in patients with low and high 
volume disease, and in patients with presence or absence of metastases at diagnosis. Likewise, the 
results do not seem to be modified according to the dichotomy between high risk and low risk. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of apalutamide upon the ADT provides a clinically meaningful delay in the progression of the 
disease in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Even though, there are 
uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in terms of OS, the results in general are considered 
clinically relevant.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The summary of clinical safety incorporates data from 2 randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 3 studies (TITAN: mCSPC population and SPARTAN: NM-CRPC population), where apalutamide 240 
mg was added to ADT in men with prostate cancer. The integrated safety population includes 2,252 
patients: 1,327 patients treated with apalutamide + ADT and 925 patients treated with placebo + ADT. 
The clinical cut-off date is 23 November 2018 for TITAN and 19 September 2017 for SPARTAN. 
The integrated analysis only presents treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which are defined as 
adverse events that occurred or worsened in severity from the first dose of study drug until 30 days after 
the last dose of study drug for TITAN and 28 days after the of last dose of study drug for SPARTAN.  
Adverse event severity and abnormal laboratory results were graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03. Thyroid stimulating hormone values at 
baseline, postbaseline, and change from baseline were summarized. These were presented separately 
from chemistry results as NCI CTCAE grading was not applied to TSH values. Liver function test data were 
summarized based on eDISH and Hy’s Law criteria (FDA 2009). Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) Version 20.0 was used for the classification of AEs. Treatment-related AEs were those 
judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to the blinded study drug. 
TEAE analyses were performed by subgroups of patients (age, race, geographic region, baseline ECOG 
performance status, and baseline PSA).  
To adjust for the time on treatment, the event rate of AEs per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure was 
also analysed. 
Determination of ADRs was based on the review of data from a total of 1,051 patients: apalutamide 240 
mg (524 patients) or placebo (527 patients) in TITAN. ADR determination was primarily based upon the 
TITAN study data; however, the SPARTAN data were also considered during the selection process. 
Patient exposure 
The demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the 
treatment arm and control arm in both studies. 
Patients in TITAN (median age of 68 years with 23% of patients 75 years or older and median weight of 
77 kg) were younger and weighed less than patients in SPARTAN (median age of 74 years with 48% of 
patients 75 years or older and median weight of 84 kg). The majority of patients in both studies were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 62/104 
  
  
white (68% in TITAN and 66% in SPARTAN). In TITAN, the majority of patients were from the Rest of 
World region (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Turkey), while in 
SPARTAN, the majority of patients were from North America or Europe. 
The observed differences in disease characteristics between the studies reflect the different patient 
populations enrolled in TITAN (mCSPC) and SPARTAN (NMCRPC). 
A history of cardiac disorders, diabetes, or hypertension was noted for 66% of patients in the apalutamide 
+ ADT arm and 61% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (75% vs 76% in SPARTAN). 
As of the cut-off dates, a lower proportion of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm discontinued 
treatment as compared with the placebo + ADT arm (34% apalutamide vs 54% placebo in TITAN and 
43% vs 76% in SPARTAN). In both studies, the higher rate of treatment discontinuation in the placebo + 
ADT arm was mainly due to progressive disease. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was more 
common in the apalutamide + ADT arm as compared with the placebo + ADT arm, but occurred less 
frequently in TITAN (7.4% apalutamide vs 3.2% placebo) as compared with SPARTAN (11% vs 6.5%). 
Skin rash (grouped term) was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the apalutamide 
+ ADT arm in both studies. 
Table 36: Treatment Disposition; Integrated Safety 
In TITAN, the median duration of treatment was 20 months for the apalutamide + ADT arm and 18 
months for the placebo + ADT arm. As of the clinical cut-off date for TITAN (23 November 2018), 66% of 
patients in the treatment arm were continuing in the study. In SPARTAN median treatment duration for 
the placebo+ADT arm was lower in TITAN (11 months vs 18 months), while for the apalutamide + ADT 
arm duration is similar.

Table 39: Summary of Dose Adjustment for Apalutamide or Placebo; Integrated Safety 
In TITAN, all patients received at least 1 prior treatment for prostate cancer and received hormone 
therapy. Most patients in TITAN were only exposed to a short course of ADT prior to entry (71% received 
prior ADT for 3 months or less prior to randomization). A lower proportion of patients in TITAN (16%) had 
prior surgery or radiotherapy as compared with SPARTAN (77%).

Bone-sparing agents were taken by 17% of apalutamide-treated patients and 24% of placebo-treated 
patients in TITAN. 
Adverse events 
Almost all patients in TITAN and SPARTAN were reported to have at least 1 or more TEAE (>93% across 
all groups). Grade 3-4 TEAEs were reported for 42% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 41% 
of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (47% vs 35% in SPARTAN and 45% vs 38% in the 
combined population).

In TITAN, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥15% of patients in either arm) of skin rash (grouped 
term), fatigue, back pain, hypertension, and arthralgia were also frequently reported in the combined 
population. Hot flush and weight increased were frequently reported TEAEs in the TITAN study only. The 
majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2. These events seldom led to treatment discontinuation 
(≤1.5%) and were rarely considered to be SAEs (≤1.1%). With the exception of skin rash (grouped 
term), these events infrequently led to dose modifications.

Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest for apalutamide are skin rash, fall, fracture, seizure and 
hypothyroidism. There was a higher incidence of adverse events of special interest reported in the 
apalutamide +ADT arm as compared with the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (38% vs 17%), SPARTAN 
(44% vs 19%) and the combined population (42% apalutamide vs 18% placebo).

Skin rash (as a grouped term) was more common for patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm as 
compared with patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (27% vs 8.5%), SPARTAN (24% vs 5.5%) 
and the combined population (25% apalutamide vs 7.2% placebo). The majority of the events were 
Grade 1 or 2. Dose modifications due to skin rash were more common in the treatment arm as compared 
with the control arm. Adverse events of skin rash seldom led to treatment discontinuation. In the 
apalutamide + ADT arm, there were 2 SAEs of skin rash in TITAN (drug eruption and generalized rash) 
and 2 SAEs of skin rash in SPARTAN (erythema multiforme and mouth ulceration). There were no 
reported events of toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome in either study.  
In both studies, events of rash usually occurred within the first few months of treatment and were 
actively managed with steroids or antihistamines; the majority of cases resolved. 
In the combined dataset, adverse reactions of skin rash were reported for 26% of patients treated with 
apalutamide. Grade 3 skin rashes (defined as covering > 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported 
with apalutamide treatment in 6% of patients. The median days to onset of skin rash was 83 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 72/104 
 
  
  
 
Seventy-eight percent of patients had resolution of rash with a median of 78 days to resolution.  
Medicinal products utilised included topical corticosteroids, oral anti-histamines, and 19% of patients 
received systemic corticosteroids. Among patients with skin rash, dose interruption occurred in 28% and 
dose reduction occurred in 14%. Skin rash recurred in 59% of patients who had dose interruption. Skin 
rash led to apalutamide treatment discontinuation in 7% of patients who experienced skin rash. 
Fall 
Fall was reported in 7.4% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 7.0% of patients in the placebo 
+ ADT arm in TITAN (17% vs 9.3% in SPARTAN and 13% vs 8.0% in the combined population). The 
majority of the events of Fall were Grade 1 or 2.  Grade 3 events were reported in 0.8% in the placebo 
and apalutamide arm. There were no Grade 4 events. Events of Fall seldom led to treatment 
discontinuation or dose modification and were rarely considered to be SAEs. 
For patients with an event fall, there was not a higher incidence of events of cognitive deficits (including 
memory impairment, amnesia, disturbance in attention and cognitive disorder) reported in the treatment 
arm as compared with the control arm, within one year before or after the event of fall. In TITAN, 2.6% 
of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 2.7% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm who reported 
an event fall also reported an event in the grouped term of cognitive deficit within one year (3.7% vs 
5.4% in SPARTAN and 3.4% vs 4.1% in the combined population). 
Fracture 
A potential mechanism for increased fracture risk is the enhanced blockade of the AR with apalutamide 
treatment. As such, bone-sparing agents were permitted concomitant medications in both studies. Bone-
sparing agents were taken by 17% of apalutamide-treated patients and 24% of placebo-treated patients 
in TITAN (12% of patients in both arms of SPARTAN). 
Fracture (grouped term) was reported in 6.3% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 4.6% of 
patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (13% vs 7.3% in SPARTAN and 10 % vs 5.7% in the 
combined population).  
Rib fracture was the most commonly reported event in the grouped term of fracture, occurring in 2.3% of 
apalutamide-treated patients and 2.3% of placebo-treated patients in TITAN (4.3% vs 4.9% in SPARTAN 
and 3.8 % vs 3.1% in the combined population).  
The majority of the events of fracture were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 and Grade 4 of fracture were reported 
in 1.1% and 0.2% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm vs 0.8% and 0 of patients in the placebo + 
ADT arm in TITAN (2.9% and 0 vs 1.0% and 0 in SPARTAN). SAEs of fracture were reported in 1.5% of 
patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm vs 0.9% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (3.5% vs 
1.0% in SPARTAN). TEAEs of fracture seldom led to treatment discontinuation or dose modification. 
A prior fall preceding fracture was common. Nearly half of patients with fracture had reported a fall in the 
7 days prior to the fracture (52% apalutamide vs 42% placebo in TITAN and 41% vs 45% in SPARTAN). 
The metastatic population in TITAN was younger, had a shorter duration of ADT exposure than the non-
metastatic population in SPARTAN. 
Seizure 
Seizure (grouped term) was reported for 3 patients (0.6%) [Grade 2 seizure in a subject with brain 
metastases, Grade 3 seizure in a subject with dehydration and fever, and Grade 2 seizure in a subject with brain 
metastases and intracranial hemorrhage] in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 2 patients (0.4%) [Grade 2 seizure 
in a subject with a metastatic brain lesion and Grade 1 tongue biting due to nerve compression from a metastatic 
lesion] in the placebo + ADT arm. Two patients (0.2%) [Grade 1 seizure in a subject with a history of febrile 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 73/104 
 
  
  
seizure, and Grade 2 seizure considered to be a result of a contusion from a fall in a subject with a history of 
Parkinson’s disease and multiple falls] vs 0% in SPARTAN (0.4% vs 0.2% in the combined population). 
In the apalutamide + ADT arm, 2 patients discontinued treatment due to seizure, and the third subject 
interrupted treatment due to seizure (and then discontinued treatment due to disease progression). For 
the patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm, the event of seizure occurred from 159 to 650 days after the 
start of study drug. 
Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism (as a grouped term) was more common in patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm as 
compared with patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (6.5% vs 1.1%), SPARTAN (8.6% vs 2.0%) 
and in the combined population (7.8% vs 1.5%).  
Hypothyroidism did not lead to treatment discontinuation or dose modification and was not reported as an 
SAE in the TITAN study or in any placebo-treated patients in SPARTAN. Hypothyroidism led to dose 
reduction, treatment discontinuation, and was classified as an SAE in 0.1% of apalutamide-treated 
patients in SPARTAN. The change from baseline in TSH was greater in patients in the apalutamide + ADT 
arm as compared with patients in the placebo + ADT arm in both TITAN and SPARTAN. There were no 
Grade 3-4 events in TITAN and SPARTAN. 
In the combined population, hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with apalutamide 
and 2% of patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
every 4 months. Hypothyroidism occurred in 30% of patients already receiving thyroid replacement 
therapy in the apalutamide arm and in 3% of patients in the placebo arm. In patients not receiving 
thyroid replacement therapy, hypothyroidism occurred in 7% of patients treated with apalutamide and in 
2% of patients treated with placebo. 
Cardiac Disorders 
During treatment, hypertension was a commonly reported TEAE, and hypertriglyceridemia was a 
commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality in both studies. 
The overall rate of Cardiac Disorders was higher in the apalutamide + ADT arm as compared with the 
placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (8.8% vs 5.9%), SPARTAN (13% vs 9.5%) and the combined population 
(11% apalutamide vs 7.5% placebo).

Table 47: Treatment-emergent Cardiac Disorders by Presence of Cardiac Risk Factors Prior to Study 
Entry; Safety Population (Study 56021927PCR3002)  
Only 1 subject in the apalutamide + ADT arm discontinued treatment due to a TEAE of atrial fibrillation in 
SPARTAN. 
QT Prolongation 
A dedicated QT/QTc study (Study 56021927PCR1019) was conducted for apalutamide which showed that 
the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for concentration dependent increase in QTcF at steady-
state was below the threshold of 20 msec for anticancer agents.  
In the combined population, for the TEAE of ‘electrocardiogram QT prolonged’, the exposure adjusted 
incidence (events per 100 P-Y) was 0.2 in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.1 in the placebo + ADT arm.  
No TEAEs of torsades de pointe were reported in the combined population. Other events of which may 
represent sequelae from QT prolongation (cardio-respiratory arrest, ventricular tachycardia, sudden 
cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation, sudden death, and ventricular arrhythmia) occurred with a similar 
frequency and in less than 0.5% of patients in either arm of the combined population.  
QT prolongation can also present as seizure; however, the 7 events of seizure that occurred in the 
combined population had alternative explanations and were not a result of QT prolongation. 
QT prolongation can also present as syncope. In TITAN, the incidence of syncope was 0.8% in both arms. 
In SPARTAN, syncope was reported for 2.2% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 1.0% of 
patients in the placebo + ADT arm (the exposure adjusted incidence was 1.5 vs 0.9 events per 100 P-Y). 
None of the patients with TEAEs of syncope in SPARTAN had events of ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular 
fibrillation, or QTc prolongation reported. In the combined population, syncope was reported for 1.7% of 
patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.9% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm. 
Ischemic Heart Disease 
In TITAN, IHD was reported by more patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm (4.4%) than the placebo + 
ADT arm (1.5%); the exposure adjusted incidence was 3.6 vs 1.4 events per 100 P-Y. This finding 
accounts for the overall difference noted in TITAN between the arms for Cardiac Disorders. Of the events 
of ischemic heart disease, 10 events in the treatment arm were Grade 3 or 4, compared with 1 Grade 3 
event in the control arm. In the apalutamide + ADT arm, 8 of the 10 patients with Grade 3 or 4 IHD were 
continuing with study treatment at the data cut-off. The number of fatal ischemic events was the same 
between treatment and control arms with 2 patients in each arm. Of the patients who had an ischemic 
event, most also had a medical history of cardiac disorders, hypertension, or diabetes (17 of 23 of 
patients in the treatment arm and 6 of 8 of patients in the control arm). Therefore, the difference in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 76/104 
 
  
  
 
rate of IHD observed in TITAN cannot be explained by medical history. Additionally, of the patients who 
had an ischemic event, TEAEs of worsening or new onset hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
hyperglycemia were reported for 30%, 13%, and 4% of patients respectively in the apalutamide + ADT 
arm. No such TEAEs were reported in the placebo + ADT arm. The median time to onset to an event of 
IHD was 403 days in the treatment arm as compared with 194 days in the control arm.  
In SPARTAN, the incidence of IHD was 3.7% in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 2.8% in the placebo + 
ADT arm; the exposure adjusted incidence (event per 100 P-Y) was numerically lower in the in the 
treatment arm (2.7) as compared with the control arm (3.4). The grouped term of ischemic heart disease 
(IHD) was reported for 4.0% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 2.1% of patients in the 
placebo + ADT arm in the combined population (the exposure adjusted incidence was 3.1 vs 2.1 events 
per 100 P-Y). 
Across the SPARTAN and TITAN studies, 6 patients (0.5%) treated with apalutamide and 2 patients 
(0.2%) treated with placebo died from an ischaemic heart disease. 
Deaths 
The incidence of fatalities due to cardiac disorders (including the grouped terms of cardiac failure, 
arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease) was the same in both arms of the combined population (0.6%); 
the exposure adjusted incidence (events per 100 P-Y) was 0.4 in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.5 in 
the placebo + ADT arm.  
Further, in the combined population: 
- 
- 
Fatal arrhythmias were reported in 0.2% of patients in the treatment arm and 0.3% of patients in 
the control arm. 
Fatal ischemic heart disease was reported in 0.5% of patients in the treatment arm and 0.2% of 
patients in the control arm; the exposure adjusted incidence was the same for both arms (0.2 
events per 100 P-Y). 
- 
Fatal cardiac failure was reported in the same proportion of patients in both arms (0.1%). 
Cerebrovascular Disorders (Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disorders and Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular 
Disorders) 
Ischemic cerebrovascular disorders were reported for 1.5% of both arms of TITAN (2.2% in apalutamide 
arm vs 1.0% in placebo arm, the exposure adjusted incidence was 1.7 vs 0.9 events per 100 P-Y, in 
SPARTAN and 2.0% vs 1.3% in the combined population).The overall incidence of hemorrhagic 
cerebrovascular disorder was low with 0.4% in the treatment arm and 0.6% in the control arm (0.6% vs 
0.3% in SPARTAN, 0.5% vs 0.4% in the combined population). 
Cognitive Deficits (memory impairment, amnesia, disturbance in attention and cognitive disorder) 
Patients receiving long-term ADT may be at risk for cognitive impairment. In TITAN, cognitive deficits 
were reported in 2.7% of the treatment arm and 1.5% of the control arm (the exposure adjusted 
incidence was 2.0 vs 1.2 events per 100- P-Y). In SPARTAN, cognitive deficits were reported for 5.2% of 
patients in the treatment arm and 3.0% of patients in the control arm (the exposure adjusted incidence 
was 3.5 vs 3.1 events per 100- P-Y). In the combined population, cognitive deficits were reported in 
4.2% of the treatment arm and 2.2% of the control arm (exposure adjusted incidence was 2.9 vs 2.0 
events per 100 P-Y). The majority of the events in the grouped term of cognitive deficits were Grade 1 or 
2.

Second Primary Cancer 
TEAEs of a second primary cancer were reported in 4.0% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 
2.8% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (6.2% vs 5.8% in SPARTAN and 5.4% vs 4.1% in 
the combined population). The 2 most commonly reported second primary cancers were basal cell 
carcinoma (1.4% apalutamide vs 1.0% placebo in the combined population) and squamous cell carcinoma 
(1.0% vs 0.2% in the combined population). No malignant or pre-malignant hematologic disorders were 
reported in either study. No signal for the development of a second primary cancer was identified with 
treatment with apalutamide.

Weight Gain 
Weight loss is an established ADR for apalutamide and weight gain is often seen with the initiation of 
ADT. In TITAN, where the majority of patients recently started ADT, the apalutamide-associated weight 
loss was manifested as less weight gain in the treatment arm as compared with the control arm. In 
SPARTAN, the apalutamide-associated weight loss was directly observed with the occurrence of more 
weight loss in the treatment arm as compared with the control arm. 
In TITAN, a weight gain of 5%-20% from baseline occurred in 39% of apalutamide-treated patients and 
46% of placebo-treated patients. Weight gain ≥ 20% from baseline was reported for 3.1% of 
apalutamide-treated patients and 2.9% of placebo-treated patients. An adverse event of weight increased 
was reported in 10% of apalutamide-treated patients vs 17% of placebo-treated patients in TITAN  
Weight gain was less frequent in the SPARTAN study, where 10% of apalutamide-treated patients and 
12% of placebo-treated patients had a weight gain of 5%-20% from baseline. Weight gain ≥ 20% from

baseline was reported for no apalutamide-treated patients and 0.3% of placebotreated patients. An 
adverse event of weight increased was reported in 3.1% of apalutamide treated patients and 2.3% of 
placebo-treated patients in SPARTAN. 
In the combined population, 22% of apalutamide-treated patients and 31% of placebo-treated patients 
had a weight gain of 5-20% from baseline. A weight gain ≥ 20% from baseline was reported in 1.2% of 
apalutamide-treated patients and 1.7% of placebo-treated patients. An adverse event of weight increased 
was reported in 6.0% of apalutamide-treated patients and 11% of placebo-treated patients in the 
combined population. 
Weight Loss 
In TITAN, a higher proportion of apalutamide-treated patients (26%) compared with placebotreated 
patients (16%) had a weight loss of 5%-20% from baseline. A weight loss ≥ 20% from baseline was 
reported in 0.8% of apalutamide-treated patients and 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. An adverse 
event of weight decreased was reported in 6.5% of apalutamide-treated patients and 5.1% of placebo-
treated patients in TITAN. 
Weight loss was more frequent in the SPARTAN study, where 42% of apalutamide-treated patients and 
19% of placebo-treated patients had a weight loss of 5%-20% from baseline. A weight loss ≥ 20% from 
baseline was reported in 1.9% of apalutamide-treated patients and 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. An 
adverse event of weight decreased was reported in 17% of apalutamide-treated patients and 6.3% of 
placebo-treated patients in SPARTAN. 
In the combined population, 36% of apalutamide-treated patients and 17% of placebo-treated patients 
had a weight loss of 5%-20% from baseline. A weight loss ≥ 20% from baseline was reported in 1.5% of 
apalutamide-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. An adverse event of weight 
decreased was reported in 13% of apalutamide-treated patients and 5.6% of placebo-treated patients in 
the combined population. 
Abnormalities in vital signs 
Regarding systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, a higher percentage of patients showed 
>160 mmHg and increase from baseline >20 mmHg and >100 mmHg and increase from baseline >10 
mmHg in apalutamide arm in both studies (see table below).

Table 50: Incidence of Abnormalities in Vital Signs; Integrated Safety 
Adverse Drug Reactions  
In the initial submission for apalutamide, the following 11 terms were selected as ADRs based upon the 
review of 1,201 patients with NM-CRPC in the SPARTAN study: fatigue, arthralgia, skin rash, pruritus, 
seizure, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fracture, fall, weight decreased, and hypothyroidism. 
In this submission, ADR selection was based upon the review of 1,051 patients with mCSPC in the TITAN 
study. A total of 30 TEAEs met the criteria of ≥1% higher absolute incidence in the apalutamide + ADT 
arm as compared with the placebo + ADT arm: 
- 
Twelve (12) of these 30 terms were already defined as ADRs in the previous submission, either as an 
individual ADR or were part of a grouped ADR term (arthralgia, rash, pruritus, rash generalized, rash 
maculo-papular, erythema, fatigue, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, weight decreased, 
blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, hypothyroidism). 
- 
Eighteen (18) of these 30 terms underwent medical evaluation by the Sponsor, which included 
review of the total incidence and exposure adjusted incidence as well as assessing the grouping of a 
term under a pre-existing SMQ or SOC. 
- 
Twelve (12) of these 18 terms were not selected to be ADRs: hyperhidrosis (3.4% apalutamide vs 
1.7% placebo); dry skin (3.2% vs 1.5%); alopecia (2.3% vs 0.6%); abdominal pain upper (3.2% 
vs 2.1%); upper respiratory tract infection (6.5% vs 5.3%); sinusitis (1.7% vs 0.6%); 
hyperkalaemia (7.4% vs 5.1%); vitamin D deficiency (1.5% vs 0 %); headache (6.7% vs 5.5%); 
epistaxis (2.1% vs 0.6%); nasal congestion (1.5% vs 0.4%); leukopenia (5.0% vs 3.6%).  
For all 12 of these terms, no potential mechanism of action was identified and the difference in 
incidence between the two arms was small (< 2.5%). In the treatment arm, Grade 3 events were 
only reported for 4 of these terms and occurred at a low frequency: hyperhidrosis (0.4% 
apalutamide + ADT vs 0% placebo), hyperkalemia (0.6% vs 0.9%), headache (0.2% in both 
arms), and upper respiratory tract infection (0.2% in both arms). No Grade 4 events were 
reported 
- 
Five (5) of these 18 terms were included as ADR: muscle spasm, diarrhea, hot flush, 
hypertension and dysgeusia. Diarrhea, hot flush, hypertension and dysgeusia were not selected 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 81/104 
 
  
  
 
 
as ADR in the initial submission as differences in exposure adjusted incidence [events/100 P-Y] 
between both arm (apalutamide and placebo) were low in SPARTAN study. A similar trend was 
observed in TITAN study. Therefore, its inclusion as ADR was considered at this moment. 
-  One (1) term (dermatitis) was added to the existing ADR grouped term of skin rash. In TITAN, 
the incidence of dermatitis was 1.5% in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.4% in the placebo + 
ADT arm. Dermatitis is likely another manifestation of the rash that has a dose-exposure 
relationship with apalutamide. 
One additional term (ischemic heart disease) did not meet the ≥1% threshold but was still chosen as a 
new ADR (see discussion on AEs of special interest). 
The most common adverse reactions are fatigue (26%), skin rash (26% of any grade and 6% Grade 3 or 
4), hypertension (22%), hot flush (18%), arthralgia (17%), diarrhoea (16%), fall (13%), and weight 
decreased (13%). Other important adverse reactions include fractures (11%) and hypothyroidism (8%).

Deaths 
The metastatic population in TITAN had a higher incidence of death (3.4% in the treatment arm and 
4.4% in the control arm) as compared with the non-metastatic population in SPARTAN (1.6% in the 
treatment arm and 0.5% in the control arm).

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Leading to Death 
TEAEs leading to death were reported for 1.9% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 3.0% of 
patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (1.6% vs 0.5% in SPARTAN). In both studies, the most 
common SOC leading to death was Cardiac Disorders.

Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs were reported for 20% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 20% of patients in the 
placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (27% vs 25% in SPARTAN). In TITAN, the most frequently reported SAEs 
(≥1% of patients in either arm) were fracture (as a grouped term), pneumonia, hematuria, urinary 
retention, spinal cord compression and back pain. Fracture (as a grouped term) was reported in 1.5% of 
patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0.9% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
In study TITAN at baseline, the only Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities that occurred were Grade 3 
neutrophils, which were reported in 2 patients (0.4%) in the apalutamide + ADT arm. During treatment, 
the most commonly reported Grade 3 abnormality was anemia (0.8% apalutamide vs 3.0% placebo). The 
only Grade 4 abnormalities were decreased neutrophils, which occurred in 3 apalutamide-treated patients 
(0.6%). 
In study SPARTAN at baseline, there were no patients with Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities. 
During treatment, the most commonly reported Grade 3 abnormalities were decreased neutrophils (0.8% 
apalutamide vs 0.3% placebo) and anemia (0.5% apalutamide and 0.5% placebo). The only Grade 4 
Assessment report

abnormalities that occurred were decreased neutrophils in 1 apalutamide-treated subject (0.1%) and 
decreased platelet count in 1 placebo-treated subject (0.3%). 
In the combined population, during treatment, the majority of hematologic abnormalities were 
categorized as Grade 2 or lower. The most commonly reported Grade 3 abnormalities were anemia (0.6% 
apalutamide and 2.0% placebo) and decreased neutrophils (0.6% apalutamide and 0.2% placebo). The 
only Grade 4 abnormalities were decreased neutrophils in 4 apalutamide-treated patients (0.3%) and 
decreased platelet count in 1 placebo-treated subject (0.1%). 
Chemistry 
At baseline in TITAN, increased ALP, which is a common observation in patients with metastatic bone 
disease, was the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality (6.1% apalutamide vs 5.2% 
placebo). No other Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in >1% of patients at baseline in either 
arm. During treatment, the most frequent laboratory abnormalities (any grade) were: increased ALP 
(38% apalutamide vs 51% placebo); increased ALT (20% apalutamide vs 35% placebo); increased AST 
(18% apalutamide vs 36% placebo). During treatment, the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormalities were: increased ALP (3.9% apalutamide vs 8.6% placebo); hyperkalemia (2.7% 
apalutamide vs 1.9% placebo); hypertriglyceridemia (2.6% apalutamide vs 2.5% placebo); hyponatremia 
(2.3% apalutamide vs 3.6% placebo). 
At baseline in SPARTAN, no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality occurred in ≥ 0.3% of patients in either 
arm. During treatment, the most frequent laboratory abnormalities (any grade) were: high cholesterol 
(77% apalutamide vs 47% placebo); hypertriglyceridemia (69% apalutamide vs 51% placebo). During 
treatment, the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were: hyperkalemia (1.9% 
apalutamide vs 0.5% placebo); hypertriglyceridemia (1.9% apalutamide vs 0.8% placebo); hyponatremia 
(1.3% apalutamide vs 0.5% placebo); increased creatinine (0.5% apalutamide vs 1.3% placebo). 
During treatment in the combined population, the most frequent laboratory abnormalities (any grade) 
were: high cholesterol (54% apalutamide vs 25% placebo); hypertriglyceridemia (51% apalutamide vs 
32% placebo); increased ALP (22% apalutamide vs 35% placebo). During treatment, the most frequent 
Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were: increased ALP (1.6% apalutamide vs 5.0% placebo); 
hyperkalemia (2.2% apalutamide vs 1.3% placebo); hyponatremia (1.7% apalutamide vs 2.3% placebo); 
hypertriglyceridemia (2.1% apalutamide vs 1.6% placebo).

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) 
For TSH, the change from baseline was greater for patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm as compared 
with patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (1.86 mIU/L vs 0.61 mIU/L), SPARTAN (2.01 mIU/L vs 
0.60 mIU/L) and the combined population (1.96 mIU/L apalutamide vs 0.61 mIU/L placebo). The adverse 
event of special interest of hypothyroidism was more frequently reported in the apalutamide + ADT arm 
as compared with patients in the placebo + ADT arm (see AEs of special interest).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Drug 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in apalutamide + ADT arm as 
compared with placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (8.0% vs 5.3%), SPARTAN (11% vs 7.8%) and the 
combined population (10% apalutamide vs 6.4% placebo). Skin rash (as a grouped term) was the most 
common TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation, occurring in 1.5% of patients in the apalutamide + 
ADT arm and 0.2% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in the combined population (2.4% vs 0% in 
SPARTAN and 2.0% vs 0.1% in the combined population). Fatigue was the next most common TEAE 
leading to treatment discontinuation occurring in 0.8% of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0% 
of patients in the placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (1.1% vs 0.3% in SPARTAN and 1.0% vs 0.1% in the 
combined population). All other TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred at a low percentage 
(≤0.5%) in both studies. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modification and Dose reduction 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to dose reduction or interruption was higher in apalutamide + ADT arm as 
compared with placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (23% vs 13%), SPARTAN (33% vs 19%) and the combined 
population (29% apalutamide vs 15% placebo). The same applies to the incidence of TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction: 7.1% in apalutamide + ADT arm as compared with 2.1% in placebo + ADT arm in TITAN 
(in SPARTAN: 9.5% vs 1.8%; in the combined population: 8.5% apalutamide vs 1.9% placebo).  
Skin Rash (grouped term) was the most common reason for dose reduction or interruption in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm in both studies. In the apalutamide + ADT arm of TITAN, a higher proportion of 
patients had a dose interruption (7.4%) or dose reduction (4.8%) due to skin rash as compared with the 
proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to skin rash (1.5%). A similar trend was noted in 
the apalutamide + ADT arm of SPARTAN, where 6.7% of patients had a dose interruption, 2.7% of 
patients had a dose reduction, and 2.4% of patients discontinued treatment due to skin rash.  
In SPARTAN, fatigue was the next most common TEAE leading to treatment reduction, occurring in 1.7% 
of patients in the apalutamide + ADT arm and 0% of patients in the placebo + ADT arm. (In TITAN, 
fatigue led to treatment reduction in 0.4% of patients in the treatment arm and 0% of patients in the 
control arm.). All other TEAEs leading to treatment reduction occurred at a low percentage (≤0.6%) in 
both studies. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruption 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to dose interruption was higher in apalutamide + ADT arm as compared 
with placebo + ADT arm in TITAN (20% vs 12%), SPARTAN (31% vs 18%) and the combined population 
(26% apalutamide vs 15% placebo). In TITAN, the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
interruption of treatment (reported for >1% of patients in either arm) were: skin rash (grouped term): 
7.4% apalutamide vs 0.8% placebo; fatigue: 1.1% apalutamide vs 0.4% placebo and hypertension: 1.1% 
apalutamide vs 1.1% placebo. In SPARTAN, the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to interruption of 
treatment (reported for >1% of patients in either arm) were: skin rash (grouped term): 6.7% 
apalutamide vs 1.3% placebo; diarrhea: 2.5% apalutamide vs 1.3% placebo; fatigue: 2.2% apalutamide 
vs 0.5% placebo; nausea: 1.6% apalutamide vs 1.0% placebo; hypertension: 1.2% apalutamide vs 0.8% 
placebo; vomiting: 1.2% apalutamide vs 1.0% placebo; hematuria: 1.1% apalutamide vs 0.5% placebo; 
urinary tract infection: 0.6% apalutamide vs 1.3% placebo.

Post marketing experience 
Based on the 1,441,320 60 mg tablets distributed worldwide from launch to 31 October 2018, the 
estimated exposure to apalutamide is 360,330 person-days, or 12,011 person-months, or 1,001 person-
years. Postmarketing surveillance of spontaneously reported AEs is ongoing. The surveillance of 
spontaneous cases of AEs reported with the use of apalutamide indicates that the safety profile of the 
drug in post-marketing use is consistent with what is known about the drugs overall established safety 
profile from clinical studies. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population included data from 2 randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies 
(TITAN and SPARTAN) in where apalutamide 240 mg was added to ADT in men with prostate cancer. 
Study TITAN is submitted as pivotal study in the current application for the new indication in mCSPC 
patients while study SPARTAN was submitted in the initial authorization for apalutamide in nmCRPC 
patients. 
Apart from expected differences due to disease characteristics (mCSPC vs NM-CRPC) and slightly worse 
ECOG performance status (ECOG1: 38% apalutamide vs 34% placebo in TITAN and 23% vs 23% in 
SPARTAN) and Gleason score (>7: 67% apalutamide vs 68% placebo in TITAN and 43% vs 44% in 
SPARTAN) for TITAN population than for SPARTAN, it should be pointed out that patients in TITAN were 
younger (median age 68 years vs 74 years), weighed less (median weight 77 Kg vs 84 kg) and history of 
cardiac disorders, diabetes or hypertension was slightly lower than patients in SPARTAN (66% 
apalutamide and 61% placebo in TITAN; 75% vs 76% in SPARTAN). Additionally, in TITAN, although all 
mCSPC patients received at least 1 prior treatment for prostate cancer and hormone therapy, time from 
diagnostic (median 0.34 years in both arms in TITAN; 7.85 apalutamida vs 7.94 placebo in SPARTAN) and 
exposure to prior ADT course (71% received prior ADT for 3 months or less prior to randomization) was 
short, being proportion of patients with prior surgery or radiotherapy low (16% in TITAN vs 77% in 
SPARTAN). It is noted that majority of patients in TITAN study had metastasis at initial diagnosis (83.7% 
in apalutamide and 78.4% in placebo). All these facts might have a relevant impact on observed safety 
results in each study. 
The median duration of treatment was 20 months for the apalutamide arms in both studies being lower in 
placebo arms (18 months in TITAN and 11 months in SPARTAN). To adjust for the time on treatment, the 
event rate of AEs per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure was also analysed. 
Study drug compliance was higher in TITAN study while discontinuations and dose adjustments were 
higher in SPARTAN study. The highest rate of treatment discontinuation was mainly due to progressive 
disease in both studies, being higher in placebo arms. Slightly higher rate of treatment discontinuation 
due to progressive disease was observed in SPARTAN, although several deaths should be considered as 
reason for termination in TITAN vs none in SPARTAN. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was more 
common in the apalutamide arm than with the placebo arm but occurred less frequently in TITAN (7.4% 
apalutamide vs 3.2% placebo) than in SPARTAN (11% vs 6.5%). Skin rash (grouped term) was the most 
common reason for treatment discontinuation in the apalutamide arm in both studies. 
Almost all patients in TITAN and SPARTAN were reported to have at least 1 or more TEAE (>93% across 
all groups). In TITAN, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥15% of patients in either arm) was skin rash 
(grouped term), fatigue, back pain, hypertension, arthralgia, hot flush and weight increased. Apart from 
hot flush and weight increased, the rest TEAEs were also frequently reported TEAEs in SPARTAN. Most of 
these events were Grade 1 or 2. With the exception of skin rash (grouped term), these events seldom led 
to treatment discontinuation (≤1.5%) or dose modification and were rarely considered to be SAEs 
Assessment report

(≤1.1%). Except for back pain which was not considered drug related by investigator, all of these 
frequently reported TEAEs are ADRs for apalutamide (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Grade 3-4 TEAEs were reported for 42% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 41% of patients in the 
placebo arm in TITAN (47% vs 35% in SPARTAN). In TITAN, the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs (≥3% of patients in either arm) were hypertension, skin rash (grouped term) and anemia. 
Hypertension and skin rash were also among the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥3% of 
patients in either arm) in SPARTAN. 
SAEs were reported for 20% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 20% of patients in the placebo arm 
in TITAN (27% vs 25% in SPARTAN).  In TITAN, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥1% of patients in 
either arm) were grouped term of fracture (1.5% apalutamide vs 0.9% placebo), pneumonia, hematuria, 
urinary retention, spinal cord compression and back pain. Apart from spinal cord compression and back 
pain, these TEAEs were also observed as SAEs in SPARTAN. 
TEAEs leading to death were reported for 1.9% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 3.0% of patients 
in the placebo arm in TITAN (1.6% vs 0.5% in SPARTAN). In both studies, the most common SOC leading 
to death was Cardiac Disorders (acute myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, myocardial 
infarction, cardiogenic shock in apalutamide arm). Deaths were reported for 3.4% of patients in the 
apalutamide arm and 4.4% of patients in the placebo arm in TITAN (1.6% vs 0.5% in SPARTAN). 
Treatment was discontinued due to a TEAE in 8.0% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 5.3% of 
patients in the placebo arm in TITAN (11% vs 7.8% in SPARTAN). Skin rash (as a grouped term) was the 
most common TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation (1.5% apalutamide vs 0.2% placebo in TITAN 
and 2.4% vs 0% in SPARTAN). Fatigue was the next most common TEAE leading to treatment 
discontinuation (0.8% vs 0% in TITAN and 1.1% vs 0.3% in SPARTAN). 
Skin Rash (grouped term) was the most common reason for dose reduction or interruption in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm in both studies. Recommendations for handling skin rash appear adequate since 
number of discontinuations in the apalutamide arm due to skin rash were lower than dose reductions or 
dose interruptions in both studies (7.4% dose interruption or 4.8% dose reduction vs 1.5% 
discontinuation in TITAN and 6.7% dose interruption or 2.7% dose reduction vs 2.4% discontinuation in 
SPARTAN) 
Higher incidence of all AEs of special interest (skin rash, fall, fracture, seizure and hypothyroidism) was 
reported with apalutamide in comparison with placebo in both studies. The incidence of these AEs is 
similar in both studies except for fall and fracture. The mHSPC population in TITAN was younger and had 
a shorter duration of ADT exposure than the nmCRPC population in SPARTAN which may contribute to the 
lower incidence of fractures with apalutamide in TITAN. In any case, the incidences of fall and fracture 
were higher with apalutamide than with placebo. 
Other adverse event of special interest for apalutamide are cardiac disorders (including cardiac failure, 
arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease and deaths), cerebrovascular disorders (including ischemic 
cerebrovascular disorders and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disorders), cognitive deficits (including 
memory impairment, amnesia, disturbance in attention and cognitive disorder) and second primary 
cancer.  
With regards to cardiac disorders, multiple observational studies have shown that men treated with ADT 
have increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The cardiotoxicity of ADT was confirmed in 
a population-based study suggesting a slightly elevated myocardial infarction risk regardless of existing 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) history (Keating2013), though other studies suggested that CVD-specific 
and all-cause mortality only occurred in patients with pre-existing CVD (Nanda 2014, Ziehr 2015). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020

Patients in the TITAN and SPARTAN studies were exposed to ADT, which was the background therapy for 
all patients in these studies. However, the underlying baseline factors were different between the 
populations enrolled in these two studies as mentioned above.  
Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the past 6 months including severe/unstable 
angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic 
events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischaemic attacks), or 
clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias were excluded from the clinical studies (see SmPC section 
4.4).   
The overall rate of cardiac disorders was slightly lower in TITAN (8.8% apalutamide vs 5.9% placebo) in 
comparison with SPARTAN (13% apalutamide vs 9.5% placebo). This may be justified by differences in 
age, weight, exposure to ADT and history of cardiac risk factors in the populations of both studies. 
However, although incidence of cardiac disorders was lower in study TITAN, it was still higher for 
apalutamide arm vs the placebo arm even in the group without history of cardiac risk factors prior to 
study entry (see Table 47).  
Main differences in cardiac disorders are led by ischemic heart disease. The term ischemic heart disease 
includes angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery occlusion, 
coronary artery stenosis, acute coronary syndrome, arteriosclerosis coronary artery, cardiac stress test 
abnormal, myocardial ischaemia, angina unstable and troponin increased. Based upon the available data 
and analyses, ischemic heart disease has been added as an ADR in the SmPC section 4.8. Section 4.4. of 
the SmPC also reflects that ischaemic heart disease, including events leading to death, occurred in 
patients treated with apalutamide. The majority of patients had cardiac risk factors. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of ischaemic heart disease and management of cardiovascular risk 
factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia should be optimised as per standard of care. 
(see SmPC section 4.4). Ischemic heart disease has been added as important identified risk in the list of 
safety concerns in the RMP.  
Regarding QT prolongation, the applicant has discussed events of torsade de pointes, syncope, seizure, 
sudden death, sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation/flutter. QT 
prolongation is already included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
For arrhythmias, even when differences are small between arms in TITAN, SPARTAN and the combined 
population, there is an overall trend to higher incidence in apalutamide arm.  
Incidence of cardiac failure and deaths due to cardiac events seems to be similar in both arms in TITAN 
study.  
Although a causal relationship between apalutamide and arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and deaths due to 
cardiac events cannot be established since data are limited, it cannot be fully ruled out at this stage and 
the MAH should continue to closely monitor these events and report when submitting the final CSR. 
Differences on secondary primary cancer, cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular disorders between arms 
were small. Although a causal relationship between apalutamide and these adverse events cannot be 
established since data are limited, it cannot be fully ruled out at this stage and the MAH should continue 
to closely monitor these events.  
Although differences between both arms in TITAN study in terms of Psychiatric disorders were small, there 
was an overall trend to higher incidence with apalutamide than with placebo. The event rate of psychiatric 
disorders when adjusted for exposure was similar between arms in both studies. Alternate explanations for 
five SAEs in apalutamide arm seem to be reasonable.  
Overall, the MAH should continue to monitor secondary primary cancer, cognitive deficit, cerebrovascular 
disorders, psychiatric disorders and discuss these events when submitting the final OS analysis. 
Assessment report

Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect updated safety information. Thirty TEAEs were 
assessed as potential ADR. Among these, 12 were already included in the SmPC as ADR, 5 have been 
added as ADR (muscle spasm, diarrhea, hot flush, hypertension and dysgeusia), and 1 has been added to 
the existing ADR group of skin rash (dermatitis).  
Twelve adverse events have not been selected as ADRs (see section on ADRs) because no potential 
mechanism of action was identified and the difference in incidence between the two arms was small (< 
2.5%). However, for some of these events, the difference in incidence between arms was higher than 
double for apalutamide in comparison with placebo (hyperhidrosis, dry skin, alopecia, sinusitis, epistaxis 
and nasal congestion). Despite no clear mechanism of action identified, some of these events can be 
considered partly in line with cutaneous toxicity observed with apalutamide. Although there is insufficient 
data to establish a causal relationship with apalutamide, it cannot be fully ruled out at this stage and the 
MAH is requested to further discuss these TEAEs when submitting updated safety data together with the 
final OS analysis. 
Regarding laboratory findings, and despite the fact that number of events is very limited, further 
discussion was requested on hyperkalemia and decreasing of neutrophils. Exposure-adjusted event rates 
were similar in both arm for leukopenia and neutropenia. However, the incidence for hyperkalaemia was 
slightly higher with apalutamide even after exposure adjustment. Although a causal relationship between 
apalutamide and hyperkalaemia cannot be established, it cannot be fully ruled out at this stage and the 
MAH is requested to further discuss the risk of hyperkalaemia when providing the updated safety data 
together with the final OS analysis. 
Overall, the incidence of the events, especially TEAEs, Grade 3-4 TEAEs, Serious TEAEs, were higher in 
patients ≥ 75 years as compared with ≤ 65 years and 65 to 74 years in both studies. Similar trend was 
observed for patients with baseline ECOG score of 1 in comparison with patients with an ECOG score of 0. 
However, this last finding is less marked on TITAN study, probably because the population has been 
overall less pretreated.  
In a country specific analysis, it was noted that the incidence of the grouped term of skin rash in the 
apalutamide + ADT arm was approximately double in Japan as compared with the entire study population 
in both studies (approximately 50% apalutamide vs 25% placebo). This observed difference in the 
incidence of skin rash between the Japanese population and the entire study population was not fully 
explained by differences in exposure. 
The SmPC has been updated to reflect the safety information available in mHSPC and include an additional 
warning on ischemic heart disease. No additional pharmacovigilance activities were considered needed as 
a result of the present procedure (see RMP). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety results in TITAN study are overall in line with the known safety profile of apalutamide (mainly 
based on SPARTAN study). However, based on results of TITAN, six TEAEs have been added as ADRs 
[ischemic heart disease, muscle spasm, diarrhoea, hot flush, hypertension, dysgeusia and dermatitis (in 
skin rash groped term)] to the ADRs established based on the results of SPARTAN study. Furthermore, a 
warning about the risk of ischemic heart disease has been included in the SmPC.  
The MAH is recommended to submit updated safety data together with the final OS analysis of study 
TITAN (REC). The MAH should continue to monitor events of arrhythmias, cardiac failure, deaths due to 
cardiac events, secondary primary cancer, cognitive deficit, cerebrovascular disorders, psychiatric 
disorders, hyperhidrosis, dry skin, alopecia, sinusitis, epistaxis and hyperkalaemia and report on these 
events when submitting the updated safety analysis from study TITAN.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. Particularly, a warning on ischaemic cardiovascular events and new safety and efficacy 
information are included in the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet and to make editorial update to the SmPC and Labelling. The RMP version 2.3 is 
approved. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the variation 
has no relevant impact on the readability of the PL.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult 
men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
For patients with this advanced stage of the disease, the aim of treatment is to improve the symptoms in 
particular pain and to extend the time during which the disease can be controlled with androgen 
deprivation therapy to delay progression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Initial treatments for both locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer have been ADT defined as 
surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonists or antagonists. 
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) and 
failure-free survival (FFS) in patients with mHSPC in multiple studies, including CHAARTED and Arm C of 
the STAMPEDE trial and has been recently approved for the treatment of mHSPC. 
In 2017, abiraterone in combination with ADT and prednisone or prednisolone was authorised in EU for 
the treatment of adult men with newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy data in support of this application were mainly provided from trial 56029127PCR3002 (TITAN), a 
Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of apalutamide plus ADT versus ADT alone in 
1,051 patients with mHSPC. Patients were excluded if the site of metastases was limited to either the 
lymph nodes or viscera (e.g., liver or lung). Patients with both high- and low-volume mHSPC were eligible 
for the study. All patients in the TITAN trial received concomitant GnRH analog or had prior bilateral 
orchiectomy. Around 11% of patients received prior treatment with docetaxel (maximum of 6 cycles, last 
dose ≤2 months prior to randomisation and maintained response prior to randomisation). 16% of 
patients had prior surgery, radiotherapy of the prostate or both. 68% of patients received prior treatment 
with a first-generation anti-androgen in the non-metastatic setting. 
The TITAN study had dual primary endpoints of OS and rPFS and was powered to show superiority in rPFS 
and OS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant treatment effect on OS in favour of apalutamide was observed. The HR for OS 
was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.89; p=0.0053) meeting the pre-specific threshold of statistical significance at 
this interim analysis. At the time of data cut-off, median OS was not reached in either treatment group. 
The landmark OS rate at 24 months favored the apalutamide + ADT arm (82% of subjects compared with 
74% of subjects in the placebo + ADT arm). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 100/104 
 
  
  
A statistically significant treatment effect on rPFS was observed in favour of apalutamide. The HR for rPFS 
was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.60; p<0.0001). The alpha boundary of 0.005 was crossed. Median rPFS was 
not reached for the apalutamide + ADT arm and was 22 months for the placebo + ADT arm. The 
landmark event-free rate at 24 months favored the apalutamide + ADT arm (68% of subjects compared 
with 48% of subjects in the placebo + ADT arm). 
As specified in the statistical plan, the rPFS endpoint was tested first at the two-sided 0.005 level of 
significance. Since rPFS was statistically significant, the OS endpoint was tested at the overall 0.05 level 
of significance. Median OS follow-up was approximately 22 months in both groups. 
The statistical testing of the secondary endpoints had to be performed by using fixed sequence testing 
according to the following pre-specified order considering clinical importance and data maturity: time to 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to pain progression, time to chronic opioid use, time to SRE.  
Treatment with apalutamide + ADT significantly delayed the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (HR = 
0.39, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.56; p < 0.0001). Median time to chemotherapy was not reached in either 
treatment group. Time to pain progression was then tested but did not cross the boundary. As a result, 
further secondary endpoints were not formally tested. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While the statistical significance in OS was reached, the number of deaths was only approximately 50% of 
the number of events anticipated for conducting the final analysis of the trial. It is noted that the plan 
tried to detect an increase in the median OS from 44 in the control arm to 59 months in the apalutamide 
arm. However, due to the interim study termination there are a number of censored patients (852, 81%) 
with many of them in the first part of the curve. The study has also substantially less follow-up than 
planned. This is accepted considering the whole evidence in the target population and the lack of 
equipoise once there has been a substantial benefit in terms of rPFS. The MAH is also recommended to 
submit the updated OS results as soon as available. 
The majority of the OS subgroups analysed support the ITT analysis. Only in the prior docetaxel group no 
favourable effect was detected with the point estimate above unity. However, due to the very low number 
of events, this result should be interpreted carefully.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In TITAN, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥15% of patients in either arm) was skin rash (grouped 
term), fatigue, back pain, hypertension, arthralgia, hot flush and weight increased. Apart from hot flush 
and weight increased, the other frequently reported TEAEs were also frequently reported TEAEs in 
SPARTAN. The majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2. With the exception of skin rash (grouped 
term), these events rarely led to treatment discontinuation (≤1.5%) or dose modification and were rarely 
considered to be SAEs (≤1.1%). Except for back pain, all of these frequently reported TEAEs are ADRs for 
apalutamide. 
Grade 3-4 TEAEs were reported for 42% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 41% of patients in the 
placebo arm in TITAN (47% vs 35% in SPARTAN). Hypertension, skin rash (grouped term) and anaemia 
were the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs. 
TEAEs leading to death were reported for 1.9% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 3.0% of patients 
in the placebo arm in TITAN (1.6% vs 0.5% in SPARTAN). 
Deaths were reported for 3.4% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 4.4% of patients in the placebo 
arm in TITAN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3945/2020 
Page 101/104 
 
  
  
Treatment was discontinued due to a TEAE in 8.0% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 5.3% of 
patients in the placebo arm in TITAN (11% vs 7.8% in SPARTAN). Skin rash (as a grouped term) was the 
most common TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Dose was modified due to a TEAE in 23.0% of patients in the apalutamide arm and 13.0% of patients in 
the placebo arm in TITAN (33.0% vs 19.0% in SPARTAN). Skin Rash (grouped term) was the most 
common reason for dose reduction or interruption in the apalutamide + ADT arm in both studies. 
Adverse events of special interest included as ADR for apalutamide are: skin rash, fall, fracture, seizure 
and hypothyroidism.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall rate of cardiac disorders was slightly lower in TITAN (8.8% apalutamide vs 5.9% placebo) in 
comparison with SPARTAN (13% apalutamide vs 9.5% placebo). This may be related to differences in age 
(median age 68 years in TITAN vs 74 years in SPARTAN), weight (median weight 77 Kg in TITAN vs 84 kg 
in SPARTAN), exposure to ADT (71% received prior ADT for 3 months or less prior to randomization in 
TITAN) and history of cardiac risk factors (66% apalutamide and 61% placebo in TITAN; 75% vs 76% in 
SPARTAN) in the populations of both studies. However, although incidence of cardiac disorders is lower in 
TITAN, it is still higher for apalutamide arm, even in the group without history of cardiac risk factors prior 
to study entry. 
Updated safety data is planned to be submitted together with the final OS analysis. There is currently 
insufficient evidence to propose an update of the product information in relation to arrhythmias, cardiac 
failure, deaths due to cardiac events, secondary primary cancer, cognitive deficit, cerebrovascular 
disorders, psychiatric disorders, hyperhidrosis, dry skin, alopecia, sinusitis, epistaxis and hyperkalaemia. 
The MAH should continue to closely monitor these events and report on these events when submitting the 
final CSR.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination of apalutamide and ADT has shown as most important effect a clinically meaningful 
delay in the progression of the disease. This benefit in postponing the progression of the tumour seems to 
translate in a longer survival. Results were consistent across the different subgroups of patients recruited 
into the clinical trial, regardless the volume or the risk of the disease.

The uncertainties related to the OS outcome are likely related to the immaturity of the data and updated 
OS data are expected to be provided by the MAH.  A further important clinical effect was the delay of the 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with the landmark at 24-month event-free rates favouring the 
apalutamide + ADT arm (91% vs 78%). 
Safety results in TITAN study are overall in line with the known safety profile of apalutamide.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on a randomised clinical trial, the use of apalutamide in combination with ADT has led to a 
substantial longer rPFS and OS. Even though there are uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in 
terms of OS, the results are considered important. Overall, the risks associated to this combination 
appear in principle manageable and in line with the already known safety profile of the drug, and, in view 
of the favourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.  
The combination increases the treatment options along with docetaxel and abiraterone, for patients with 
mHSPC, regardless the risk or volume of the disease. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Erleada for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in 
combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is positive.

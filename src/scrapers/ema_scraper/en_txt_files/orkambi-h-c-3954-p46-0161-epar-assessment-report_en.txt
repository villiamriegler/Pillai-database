Introduction 
On  29/09/2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Orkambi  [VX15-809-110 
(Treatment Period 2)], in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study  VX15-809-110  (Study  110)  was  a  Phase  3,  open  label,  multicenter,  rollover  study  in  subjects 
aged  6  years  and  older  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF),  who  were  homozygous  for  F508del-CFTR,  and  who 
participated  in  parent  Study  VX14-809-109  or  Study  VX13-809-011B.  Study  110  consisted  of  2 
Treatment Periods. 
Treatment  Period  1 was a 96-week study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability 
of  LUM/IVA  treatment  for  96  weeks  in  subjects  aged  6  years  and  older  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF), 
homozygous  for  F508del.  Efficacy  was  evaluated  as  a  secondary  objective.    The  results  of  treatment 
Period 1 [Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019)] have been previously 
submitted  under  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  1234/2008  as  a  Type  II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049, CHMP Opinion 09 July 2020). 
Treatment  Period  2 was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed LUM/IVA treatment 
in Treatment Period 1 and were aged 6 through 11 years at the time of entry into Treatment Period 2. 
LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately  168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment, 
or until LUM/IVA was commercially available for the eligible subjects. 
The Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August  2020), submitted by the MAH within this procedure, 
includes  the  final  results  from  both  Treatment  Periods  1  and  2.  The  MAH  states  that  because 
Treatment  Period  1  has  already  been  assessed  by  CHMP  as  a  Type 
II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049), only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and 
are discussed further below. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
CHMP comment 
The  MAH  should  clarify  if,  apart  from  the  results  of  Treatment  Period  2,  there  are  other  differences 
between  Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019),  previously  submitted 
within  variation  EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049,  and  Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August  2020), 
submitted  by  the  MAH  within this  procedure.  Differences  between the two  CSR  should  be highlighted 
and adequately discussed (OC).

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study: VX15-809-110 (Treatment Period 2) 
Study  Initiation  (Treatment  Period  2):  21  March  2018  (date  first  eligible  subject  signed  the 
informed consent/assent form) 
Study  Completion  (Treatment  Period  2):  24  April  2020  (date  last  subject  completed  the  Safety 
Follow-up Visit) 
Treatment Period 2 was conducted at 3 sites in France. 
Treatment Period 2 was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed LUM/IVA treatment in 
Treatment  Period  1  and  were  aged 6  through  11  years  at  the  time  of  entry  into  Treatment  Period  2. 
LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately  168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment 
in  Treatment  Period  2  or  until  LUM/IVA  was  commercially  available  for  the  eligible  subjects.  All  10 
subjects  enrolled  in  Treatment  Period  2  discontinued  treatment  when  commercial  drug  became 
available for children 6 through 11 years of age in France. Thus, the maximum treatment duration in 
Treatment  Period  2  was  up  to  approximately  89  weeks  of  additional  LUM/IVA  treatment.  Treatment 
duration of LUM/IVA ranged from 80 to 624 days in Treatment Period 2). 
The Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August  2020), submitted by the MAH within this procedure, 
includes  the  final  results  from  both  Treatment  Periods  1  and  2.  The  MAH  states  that  because 
Treatment  Period  1  has  already  been  assessed  by 
the  EMA  as  a  Type  II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049), only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and 
are discussed further below. 
Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019) was previously submitted to the 
EMA  under  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  1234/2008  as  a  Type  II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049).

Treatment Period 2 included only a Treatment Cohort (referred to as Treatment Cohort Period 2) and 
was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed Treatment Cohort Period 1 and who were 
aged 6 through 11 years at the time of entry into Treatment Period 2. LUM/IVA was to be administered 
for up to approximately 168 additional weeks in Treatment Period 2 or until LUM/IVA was commercially 
available for the eligible subjects. 
In Treatment Period 2, safety assessments included vital signs, physical examinations, ophthalmologic 
examinations,  serum  chemistry  for  liver  function  test  (LFT)  parameters,  and  monitoring  of  adverse 
events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) at longer intervals than assessed in Treatment Period 1.  
Efficacy was not evaluated in Treatment Period 2.

requirements outlined in Protocol Version 2.0 and Protocol Version 3.1. 
4. History of drug intolerance in the previous (parent) study that would have posed an additional risk 
to the subject in the opinion of the investigator, and which should have been discussed with the Vertex 
medical monitor. Examples of subjects who may not have been eligible for Treatment Cohort Periods 1 
or 2 included (but were not limited to) the following: 
• Subjects with a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug 
•  Liver  function  test  (LFT)  abnormality  during  study  drug  treatment  in  the  previous  (parent)  study 
(Study 109 or Study 011B) or Treatment Cohort Period 1 for which a clear cause was not identified: 
o Abnormal liver function defined as any 2 or more of the following: 
a. ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) aspartate transaminase (AST) 
b. ≥3 × ULN alanine transaminase (ALT) 
c. ≥3 × ULN gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
d. ≥3 × ULN alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
o ALT or AST >5 × ULN 
o Total bilirubin >2 × ULN 
o Other LFT abnormalities that would have posed an additional risk to the subject in the opinion of the 
investigator or Vertex 
• Other severe or life-threatening reactions to the study drug in the previous (parent) study 
5.  History  of  poor  compliance  with  study  drug  and/or  procedures  in  the  previous  (parent)  study  as 
deemed by the investigator. 
6. Participation in an investigational drug trial (including studies investigating LUM and/or IVA). NOTE: 
Participation  in  a  non-interventional  study  (including  observational  studies,  registry  studies,  and 
studies  requiring  blood  collections  without  administration  of  study  drug)  was  permitted  (Treatment 
Cohort Period 1 only). 
Study Restrictions 
The medications described in Table 9-1 were prohibited while subjects were receiving LUM/IVA. 
A  non-exhaustive  list  of  study  prohibitions  and  cautions  for  food  and  medication  was  provided  in  the 
Study Reference Manual. 
Table 9-1 Study Restrictions 
Treatments

In Treatment Period 2, subjects aged 6 through 11 years received LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg (2 × LUM 
100-mg/IVA 125-mg tablet). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety data: For Treatment Cohort Period 2, the analysis of safety data was limited to AEs, SAEs, 
LFTs, vital signs, and OEs. 
Clinical Laboratory: The following analyses for the LFT parameters of ALT, AST, ALP, and total 
bilirubin were conducted: 
• The number and percentage of subjects meeting the defined threshold criteria (SAP Version 1.0) 
during the Treatment-emergent Period of Treatment Cohort Period 2 were summarized. 
• A listing for subjects with all LFT results during the Treatment-emergent Period of Treatment Cohort 
Period 2 was presented. The listing included all parameters of the LFT assessment at all visits. 
Results of the urine pregnancy tests were listed in an individual subject data listing. 
Vital sign parameters and Ophthalmological Examinations (OE) were presented as a data listing only. 
Statistical Methods 
For  Treatment  Cohort  Period  2  subjects,  safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  treatment-emergent 
period, which started from the Study 110 Week 96 dose date +1 or Week 96 visit date +1, whichever 
occurred later; up to 28 days (inclusive) after the last dose of this dosing period, or the last available 
date in Study 110 Treatment Cohort Period 2, whichever occurred first. 
For Treatment Cohort Period 2, all summaries included all subjects enrolled in that cohort. 
For Treatment Cohort Period 2, AEs were classified as TEAEs or post-treatment AEs. 
•  TEAE:  any  AE  that  increased  in  severity  or  that  was  newly  developed  in  the  treatment-emergent 
period of Treatment Cohort Period 2. 
•  Post-treatment  AE:  any  AE  that  increased  in  severity  or  that  was  newly  developed  in  the  post-
treatment period of Treatment Cohort Period 2. 
AEs with missing or partial start dates were classified as TEAEs if there was no clear evidence that the 
AEs  started  before  or  after  study  treatment.  Details  regarding  handling  rules  of  missing  dates  are 
included in SAP Version 1.0. 
AE  summary  tables  were  presented  by  MedDRA  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  and  Preferred  Term  (PT) 
using frequency counts, percentages (i.e., number and percentage of subjects with 1 or more events), 
and  exposure-adjusted  number  of  events  (i.e.,  number  of  events  per  100  patient-years  [100PY]). 
When summarizing the number and percentages of subjects, subjects with multiple occurrences of the 
same AE or a continuing AE were counted once, and only the maximum severity level was presented in 
the  severity  summaries,  and  the  worst/highest  relationship  level  in  the  relationship  summaries. 
Exposure-adjusted  number  of  events  summarized  the  number  of  events  per  100PY  for  AE-related 
safety data. Note: 1 patient with 48 weeks of exposure duration was defined as 1 patient-year. 
Results of safety assessments for Treatment Cohort Period 2 were summarized for all enrolled subjects 
using descriptive statistics; no formal statistical testing was performed. 
CHMP comment

AEs  for Treatment Period 2 have been presented only as number and percentage of subjects with an 
event. When summarizing the number and percentages of subjects, subjects with multiple occurrences 
of the same AE within a category was counted only once in that category. 
Exposure-adjusted number of events (i.e., number of events per 100 patient-years [100PY]) have not 
been presented for Treatment Period 2. 
However, given that only 10 patients have been enrolled in Treatment Period 2, the issue is not further 
pursued. 
COVID-19 
Three  subjects  from  1  site  in  Treatment  Period  2  were  impacted  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Safety 
measures were implemented to provide subjects the opportunity to continue participation in the study 
while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure through travel.  
These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the 
protection  of  subjects,  investigators,  and  site  personnel  while  maintaining  compliance  with  GCP  and 
minimizing impact to study integrity. 
A  summary  of  these  measures  pertinent  to  Study  110  Treatment  Cohort  Period  2  are  summarized  in 
Protocol Addendum 1. 
•  Subjects  were  contacted  by  site  personnel  by  telephone/video  call  to  complete  the  remaining 
scheduled  visits  (i.e.,  the ETT  visit).  During this  telephone/video  call(s),  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
LUM/IVA  was  evaluated  to  ensure  subject  safety.  These  assessments  included  a  review  of  AEs, 
medications, and study drug administration. 
• Blood samples for safety assessments were collected and analyzed at local laboratories. Specifically, 
an LFT panel was performed, including ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total bilirubin. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of  the  240  subjects  in  Treatment  Cohort  Period  1,  13  subjects  were  enrolled  at  sites  in  France.  Ten 
subjects  were  eligible  for  Treatment  Cohort  Period  2;  all  10  enrolled  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
LUM/IVA  during  Treatment  Period  2.  All  10  subjects  discontinued  treatment  when  commercial  drug 
became available for children 6 through 11 years of age in France. 
The  treatment  duration  of  LUM/IVA  ranged  from  80  to  624  days  for  subjects  in  Treatment  Cohort 
Period 2. 
No subjects completed treatment or the study in Treatment Cohort Period 2; all 10 (100.0%) subjects 
discontinued treatment because commercial drug became available in France. 
CHMP comment 
During  Treatment  Period  2,  LUM/IVA  was  to  be  administered  for  up  to  approximately  168  weeks  of 
additional LUM/IVA treatment or until LUM/IVA was commercially available for the eligible subjects. All 
10  subjects  enrolled  in  Treatment  Period  2  discontinued  treatment  early,  when  commercial  drug 
became  available  for  children  6  through  11  years  of  age  in  France.  Thus,  the  maximum  treatment 
duration  in  Treatment  Period  2  was  up  to  approximately  89  weeks  of  additional  LUM/IVA  treatment. 
Treatment duration of LUM/IVA in Treatment Period 2 ranged from 80 to 624 days (from less than 3

months to slightly less than 2 years). The MAH should provide mean and median treatment duration in 
Treatment Period 2, for the 10 patients enrolled in Treatment Period 2 (OC). 
Baseline data 
Nine out of 10 subjects were White (90.0%) and not Hispanic or Latino (90.0%). Half of the subjects 
were  male  (50.0%).  The  mean  age  at  parent  study  baseline  was  7.6  years  (SD:  0.84;  range  6  to  9 
years). 
The most common concomitant medications (>50% of subjects) taken during Treatment Period 2 were 
pancreatin,  cholecalciferol,  dornase  alfa,  sodium  chloride,  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid,  tobramycin,  and 
tocopheryl acetate.

For 17/58 (29%) of the TEAEs, the outcome was reported as not recovered/ not resolved. Apart from 
one  event  of  mild  Headache  (reported  as  unlikely  related),  all  the  other  events  were  reported  as  not 
related  and  the  dose  was  not  changed  following  the  occurrence  of  the event. Twelve  of  these  events 
were  mild  [PTs:  headache,  gastritis,  cough  (n=2),  rhinitis,  nasopharyngitis,  hepatomegaly,  epistaxis, 
dyspepsia,  constipation,  rhinitis  allergic,  wheezing)  and  five  were  moderate  in  intensity  (PTs: 
abdominal pain, glucose tolerance impaired, bacterial disease carrier, bronchiectasis, bronchitis).

CHMP comment 
Of note, in the Tables reporting AEs by PT, when summarizing number and percentage of subjects, a 
subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once in that category. 
Thus,  the  information  provided  may  be  misleading.  For  example  the  PT  of  infective  PEX  of  CF  are  4 
(40%)  but  PEx  occurred  more  than  one  time  in  2  out  of  4  subjects:  in  two  subjects  ≥2  PEx  event 
occurred (of note, in one of these subjects, 3 PEx events occurred within 8 months); in a third subject 
one event of PEx and a further event of Pneumopathy/ Radiological Focus on the left base of the lung 
occurred.  
Weight, Height, and BMI

Weight,  height,  and  BMI  data  were  generally  consistent  with  a  growing  pediatric  population.  One 
subject  had  an  AE  of  weight  decreased  that  was  moderate  in  severity  and  considered  not  related  to 
study drug. 
Ophthalmological Examinations 
One  subject  had  abnormal  lens  findings  on  both  eyes  at  the  ETT  visit;  no  lens  opacity  was  reported. 
Previous  OEs  for  this  subject  were  normal,  including  visits  during  Treatment  Period  1.  All  other 
subjects had normal lens findings in Treatment Cohort Period 2. No subject had an AE related to lens 
findings. 
CHMP comment 
The MAH states that one subject, with previous normal Ophthalmological Examinations,  had abnormal 
lens  findings  on  both  eyes  at  the  Early  Termination  of  Treatment  visit.  The  MAH  should  clarify  what 
kind  of  abnormal  findings  were  reported  and  provide  information  on  the  follow-up  of  this  event  i.e. 
resolved/not (OC).  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study VX15-809-110 (Study 110) was a Phase 3, open label, multicenter, rollover study in subjects 
aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF), who were homozygous for F508del-CFTR, and who 
participated in parent Study VX14-809-109 or Study VX13-809-011B.  
Study 110 consisted of 2 Treatment Periods. 
Treatment Period 1 was a 96-week study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
LUM/IVA treatment for 96 weeks in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF), 
homozygous for F508del. Efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective.  Treatment Period 1 results 
have already been assessed by CHMP through a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049). 
The MAH states that only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and thus 
only results of Treatment Period 2 are discussed in this AR. 
However, given that Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020), submitted by the MAH  within this 
procedure, includes the final results from both Treatment Periods 1 and 2,   the MAH was requested to 
clarify  if,  apart  from  the  results  of  Treatment  Period  2,  there  were  other  differences  between  Study 
110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019),  previously  submitted  within  variation 
EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049, and  Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August  2020), submitted by the 
MAH within this procedure. This is deemed of importance, also in light of the fact that the final results 
from  Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  will  be  used  to  provide  additional  context  to  the  disease 
progression patterns observed in the analyses of US CFFPR and ECFSPR data within the PAES study in 
the 2-5 years age range.  
The MAH clarified  that, apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, the only differences between the 
Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019;  previously  submitted  within  variation 
EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049) and Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) are minimal consisting 
of clarifications or correction of typos. No changes or updates to the Treatment Period 1 data or results 
discussion were made in the Study 110 Final CSR.  
Treatment  Period  2  was optional for subjects enrolled at 3 sites in France. All the 10 subjects who 
were <12 years of age at the end of the 96 weeks of Treatment Period 1, opted to enrol in Treatment 
Period 2 of the study to receive up to 168 weeks (approximately) of additional LUM/IVA treatment, for 
continued assessment of safety.  
All 10 subjects enrolled in Treatment Period 2 discontinued prematurely from Treatment Period 2 (prior 
to the foreseen 168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment), when commercial drug became available 
for  children  6  through  11  years  of  age  in  France.  The  maximum  treatment  duration  in  Treatment 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/278069/2021  
Page 17/18 
 
 
 
Period 2 was up to approximately 89 weeks (624 days) of additional LUM/IVA treatment; the mean and 
median  treatment  duration  was  414.8  days  and  426.5  days  (ranging  from  80  to  624  days), 
respectively. 
Although this is a very small subgroup and therefore making a comparison has key limits, the baseline 
characteristics  at  parent  study  baseline  of  this  small  subgroup  entering  Treatment  period  2  were 
similar to the overall population with the exception of being younger (7.6 years range: 6 to 9 years as 
compared  to  8.9  range  6-12)  and  as  a  consequence  of  having  the  anthropometric  measures  slightly 
lower than those of the overall population. The baseline disease characteristics were similar i.e. sweat 
chloride or even indicating milder lung disease i.e. ppFEV1.   
Efficacy outcomes were not assessed in treatment Period 2. 
As regards to safety in Treatment Cohort Period 2, most subjects (90.0%) had at least 1 AE however 
these  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity;  no  deaths  or  SAE  occurred.    No  subject  had  AEs  that  were 
considered  related  or  possibly  related  to  study  drug,  AE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation,  or  AE 
leading to treatment interruption. 
No  clinically  meaningful  adverse  changes  or  trends  were  observed  for  laboratory  or  vital  sign 
measurements and specifically there were no transaminase elevations >3 × ULN.  
In these 10 subjects that received up to approximately 89 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment, no 
new  safety  concerns  were  identified.    In  Tables  reporting  AEs  by  PT,  a  subject  with  multiple  events 
within  a  category  was  counted  only  once  in  that  category,  thus  numbers  may  be  misleading;  for 
example the PT of infective PEX of CF are 4 (40%) but PEx occurred more than one time in 2 out of 4 
subjects; in a third subject one event of PEx and a further event of Pneumopathy/ Radiological Focus 
on  the  left  base  of  the  lung  occurred.  Due  to  the  limited  number  (N=10)  of  subjects  enrolled  in 
Treatment Cohort Period 2, the variable treatment duration in each subject (treatment duration ranged 
from  80  to  624  days)  and  due  to  multiple  events  counted  only  once  within  each  category,  no 
conclusion may be drawn on the frequencies of AEs observed in this study.  
2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: No regulatory action required. 
3.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The  MAH  should  clarify  if,  apart  from  the  results  of  Treatment  Period  2,  there  are  other 
differences between Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019), previously 
submitted  within  variation  EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049,  and  Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24 
August 2020), submitted by the MAH within this procedure. Differences between the two CSR 
should be highlighted and adequately discussed.  
2.  The MAH should provide mean and median treatment duration in Treatment Period 2,  for the 
10 patients enrolled in Treatment Period 2 
3.  The  MAH  should  clarify  what  kind  of  abnormal  findings  were  reported  in  the  subject  with 
previous normal Ophthalmological Examinations, that had abnormal lens findings on both eyes 
at  the  Early  Termination  of  Treatment  visit  and  provide  information  on  the  follow  up  of  this 
event i.e. resolved/not.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

Question 1 
1. 
The  MAH  should  clarify  if,  apart  from  the  results  of  Treatment  Period  2,  there  are  other 
differences  between  Study  110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019),  previously 
submitted  within  variation  EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049,  and  Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August 
2020),  submitted  by  the  MAH  within  this  procedure.  Differences  between  the  two  CSR  should  be 
highlighted and adequately discussed. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
Apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, the only differences between the Study 110 Treatment 
Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019; previously submitted within variation 
EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049) and Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) are: 
• the study description was edited to clarify the completion of Treatment Period 2; 
• references to “Treatment Cohort” were updated to “Treatment Cohort Period 1” throughout to clearly 
differentiate from the Treatment Cohort Period 2 data; 
•  Section  9.8.1.1  was  added  to  summarize  the  changes  in  study  conduct  due  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
• typographical errors were corrected.

Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
Vertex has followed up with the site and ophthalmologist regarding the subject who had an abnormal 
lens  finding  on  both  eyes  (though  no  lens  opacity  was  reported;  Study  110  CSR/  Listing  16.2.8.3a2) 
for  the  ophthalmological  examination  (OE)  at  the  Early  Termination  of  Treatment  (ETT)  visit.  The 
ophthalmologist has confirmed that the original worksheet was filled out incorrectly and that the lenses 
for both eyes were normal at the ETT visit. 
A Study 110 CSR errata page correcting the error regarding the abnormal lens findings at the ETT visit 
for in the Study 110 Final CSR is submitted with this response.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AstraZeneca AB submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 9 November 2020 an application for a variation following a worksharing 
procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
The following changes were proposed:

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Forxiga and Edistride based on the results 
from the renal outcomes study D169AC00001 (DAPA-CKD). The Annex II.B and Package Leaflet of these 
products are updated accordingly. The DAPA-CKD study is a category 3, Post-Authorisation Safety Study 
(PASS) listed in the dapagliflozin RMP to evaluate the potential risk of lower limb amputation; it is a 
multicentre, event-driven, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study, evaluating 
the effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo, given once daily in addition to standard of care, to prevent the 
progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or cardiovascular (CV)/renal death.  
In addition, the Risk Management Plan for dapagliflozin (version 25s3) has been updated. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0373/2018 of 7 December 2018  on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver for dapagliflozin (Forxiga), 
(EMEA-000694-PIP04-18) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did seek Scientific advice at the CHMP (see section 4.1.3).

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
This application is based upon the single pivotal trial DAPA-CKD (D169AC00001) which was designed to 
support a new indication for the use of dapagliflozin 10 mg for the treatment of CKD: Dapagliflozin is 
indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.  
4.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
CKD is a serious and progressive condition that is associated with CV disease and increased risk of adverse 
outcomes including HF (Dhingra et al 2011), premature death (Muntner et al 2002), ESRD, and the need for 
RRT (Webster et al 2017). Globally, the most common causes of CKD are diabetes (42%), hypertension 
(18%), and glomerulonephritis of varying aetiologies (18%) (Xie et al 2018). An estimated 700 million 
people worldwide live with CKD (GBD Collaborators 2018). The global prevalence of CKD stage 3 to 5 
(defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) is estimated at 10.6% (Hill et al 2016); and estimates of global 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality of CKD have all increased dramatically since 1990; an effect driven by 
population growth, ageing, and increased prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (Xie et al 2018). 
Standard of care for CKD in patients with and without diabetes is represented by blood pressure control and 
reduction of proteinuria through RAAS blockade (ACE-I or ARB) combined with CV risk management and/or 
and glycaemic control as necessary (Inker et al 2014, KDIGO 2013).  
Another SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, has demonstrated cardiorenal efficacy in patients with CKD and 
T2DM (Perkovic et al 2019), and is currently approved for the treatment of diabetes nephropathy, in addition 
to standard of care. These results have recently been recognised in the KDIGO 2020 Clinical Practice 
Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease which recommend initiation of an SGLT2 
inhibitor in patients with CKD, T2DM and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (KDIGO 2020). 
However, interventional studies assessing the use of ACE-I or ARB for the treatment for DKD (Brenner et al 
2001, Lewis et al 2001) indicate that patients treated with these drugs remain at risk of morbidity, mortality, 
and progression to ESRD. An unmet need remains for safe and effective therapies that further reduce CKD 
morbidity, mortality, and progression towards ESRD, irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes or 
albuminuria. 
4.1.2.  About the product 
Dapagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, previously approved for the treatment 
of patients with T1DM or T2DM. Additionally, dapagliflozin has been recently approved for the treatment of 
heart failure in adult patients with HFrEF.  
4.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH sought advice from the FDA and EMA on the proposed design of the DAPA-CKD trial in 2016. At the 
time feedback was sought, the trial was proposed as a 3-arm trial in which patients would be randomised 
1:1:1 to Dapa 10 mg, Dapa 5 mg, or placebo. Subsequent advice has been sought from the FDA. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 8/116 
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of the interaction with the EMA in March 2016, it was suggested that the proposed 3-arm study 
design was changed to 2-arm, Dapa 10mg and placebo. Primary endpoint was adjusted to include a greater 
sustained reduction of eGFR (≥ 50%) and an altered definition of ESRD as well as the lower limit for 
albuminuria raised to 200 mg/g. Additional comments from the EMA included the removal of CV death from 
primary composite endpoint, titration of background treatment to obtain adequate BP control, collection of 
safety data based on known dapagliflozin safety profile and close monitoring of volume depletion.  
As a result of the interaction with the FDA in June 2016, sample size was increased to provide 90% power at 
alpha of 0.05, the schedule for assessment of renal function was adjusted so that the first post-enrolment 
eGFR assessment would occur at 14 days and renal adverse events, amputations, and fractures were 
included as adverse events of special interest. 
4.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
4.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for the drug substance dapagliflozin (as FORXIGA™) has 
previously been evaluated and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA/H/C/002322) with 
market authorization on 12 November 2012. 
The present submission concerns an application for an additional indication for FORXIGA in adults for the 
treatment of chronic kidney disease. An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been undertaken for 
dapagliflozin in accordance with the EMA Guidance. The assessment, including the results from the 
environmental fate and effects testing is presented as part of the submission. 
No new data are provided in this updated risk assessment. However, the assessment has been updated and 
include a recalculation of PEC surface water using default market penetration factor (0.01) as opposed to the 
previously used refined value. In addition, in the evaluation of the environmental effects of dapagliflozin to 
sediment dwelling organisms PECSediment for dapagliflozin is now estimated according to the ECHA Guidance 
and the NOEC for sediment dwelling species normalised to a “standard sediment” with an organic carbon 
content of 10%, in accordance with the EMA guidance. 
Recalculated PEC surface water  
PECsurface water = (10 mg x 0.01) / (200 L x 10) = 0.05 µg/L  
Recalculated PEC sediment 
The PECSediment for dapagliflozin is estimated according to the ECHA Guidance (Ref 19). This estimation relies 
in part on the PEC for dapagliflozin of 0.05 μg/L. The estimation of PECSediment uses the following equation. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 9/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The fraction of organic carbon (Foc) in suspended matter is 0.1 (Ref 19) and the solid-water partition 
coefficient is taken from the adsorption/desorption study. The Kd(ads) was 51 (taken from Report No. 
BL8614/B) and was used to estimate the likely removal of dapagliflozin by adsorption, during sewage 
treatment. The content of carbon in sewage is 37% (Ref. 11), therefore the equivalent Koc value would be: 
Koc = Kd(ads) / 0.37 = 51 /0.37 = 138 and therefore 
Recalculated PNEC Sediment 
In accordance with the EMA guidance (Ref: “ERA QA 2011”)) the NOEC for sediment dwelling species is 
normalised to a “standard sediment” with an organic carbon content of 10% (FOCstandard sediment), according to 
the equation; 
The organic carbon content of the artificial sediment used in the previously submitted Chironomus riparius 
toxicity study was determined via loss on ignition to be 2.4% (FOCmeasured) (Study report No BL8661/B). 
Therefore, the normalised NOECstandard sediment is 150000 × (10/2.4) = 625000 μg/kg dry weight.

**) calculated highest concentration in the test vessels, see Assessor’s comments below. 
6250 (µg/kg) 
The recalculated PEC/PNEC ratios for microorganisms (<0.1), groundwater (<1) and surface water (<1), as 
well as for sediment (<1) are all below the trigger points and no further studies are thus required. 
4.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the present ERA the MAH proposes a new calculation of PECsediment and PNECsediment as compared to 
calculations used in the initial application approved in 2012. Both calculations are considered acceptable and 
do not change the risk assessment for sediment. 
The previously calculated highest concentration in the test vessels of 107.6 mg/L has been used for 
calculation of PNEC microorganisms instead of the proposed 200 mg/L in the submitted ERA. This is in line 
with data presented in the original EPAR for Forxiga. 
Considering the previously submitted data and the now submitted updated PEC and PNEC calculations, 
dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
4.3.  Clinical aspects 
4.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
4.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
popPK analysis 
One pre-dose PK sample per patient was collected at Week 52 in the DAPA-CKD study. Due to the sparseness 
of the dapagliflozin concentration measurements in this study with adult CKD patients, a previously 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 11/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
established popPK model for dapagliflozin in healthy subjects, and adult and paediatric patients with T2DM 
was used as a basis to estimate the PK exposure and properties in adult patients with CKD.    
Aim popPk 
The aim of this exploratory analysis was to: 
1.  Characterise the PK of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD using a popPK model previously established 
in adults with T2DM, paediatric patients with T2DM, and healthy subjects 
2.  Compare dapagliflozin systemic exposure between different patient populations, including CKD 
patients with T2DM or without diabetes and adult patients with T2DM. 
Data 
For DAPA-CKD, 0.056% of the PK samples were excluded due to uncertain dosing records. In addition, 7.1% 
of the samples were BLQ. Table 2 provides a summary of the data used in this popPK analysis. In total, 
11480 plasma PK samples from 3101 subjects treated with dapagliflozin were available (placebo-treated 
patients were excluded from the analysis). From these samples, the majority (82.4%) were from the adult 
T2DM and healthy subject studies, 15.5% from DAPA-CKD and 2.1% from the paediatric T2DM study. 
A summary of the baseline covariates for the 3055 subjects used in the analysis is available in Table 3. 
Overall, the median age was similar and median eGFR lower in the CKD patients with T2DM or without 
diabetes compared with adult T2DM patients.

Final model 
The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. 
Exponential BSVwas estimated on CL/F and Vp/F. The BSV on KA was fixed to 8.52 from model estimated on 
adult T2DM and healthy subject data and the paediatric T2DM study. A combined error model was applied to 
account for residual variability and a separate residual variability was estimated for the paediatric patients. 
eGFR (higher CL/F with higher eGFR), and sex (higher CL/F for males), were used as covariates on CL/F. In 
addition, bodyweight (higher Vc/F with higher body weight) were used for Vc/F. The PK parameter estimates 
are presented in Table 5. CL/F was 21.6 L/h, which is very close to the previous estimate in T2DM patients 
and healthy subjects (22.9 L/h). The condition number was high, suggesting model simplification may be 
possible however the prediction-corrected visual predictive checks stratified on study are shown in Figure 8 
indicated that the model could accurately describe the data.

Exposure in CKD patients 
CKD patients with T2DM or without diabetes had similar model-derived AUC. Median AUC was approximately 
1.6-fold higher in CKD patients compared to adults with T2DM but without CKD. No impact of race or gender 
was observed for AUC. Higher AUC was observed in patients with higher age or lower body weight. However, 
these differences were not considered to be clinically relevant.

4.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new information regarding biopharmaceutics is included in this application, which is considered 
acceptable. 
4.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH proposed to add in section 5.2 of the SmPC: 
“The effect of reduced renal function on systemic exposure was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic 
model. Consistent with previous results, model predicted AUC was higher in patients with chronic kidney 
disease compared with patients with normal renal function and was not meaningfully different in chronic 
kidney disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without diabetes.” 
This is supported by the popPK analysis. The stratified pcVPCs indicate that the model is satisfactory. VPCs 
stratified on eGFR could potentially have been useful. PK is however descriptive and the lack of such VPCs is 
not further perused. The update in section 5.2 in the SmPC is accepted.

4.3.5.  Conclusion clinical pharmacology 
The MAHs conclusion that the AUC was higher in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with patients 
with normal renal function and was not meaningfully different in chronic kidney disease patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus and without diabetes, is accepted. 
4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
4.4.1.  Main study 
A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality 
in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease 
Methods 
DAPA-CKD was an international, multicentre, event-driven, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo, given once daily in 
addition to standard of care, to prevent the progression of CKD and renal or CV death. 
It was estimated that approximately 10000 patients at approximately 450 study sites in approximately 20 
countries would be enrolled to reach the target of approximately 4000 randomized patients. 
Study duration 
The study was event-driven. The anticipated duration of the study was approximately 45 months with an 
estimated mean treatment period for a patient of 33 months. The study closure procedures were to be 
initiated when the predetermined number of primary endpoints were predicted to have occurred (n=681) 
(Figure 1). The study duration could be changed if the event rate or randomization rate were different than 
anticipated. The study could be terminated early if either a clear beneficial or harmful effect of the study 
Figure 1: Study Design 
treatment was detected during the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review.

Study participants 
Adult patients were eligible to participate in the study if they had CKD defined as eGFR ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD-EPI Formula) at Visit 1, and evidence of increased albuminuria 3 months or more 
before Visit 1 and UACR ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g at Visit 1. 
UACR ≥ 200 mg/g was selected as the lower inclusion limit for UACR in-line with the principles of prognostic 
enrichment (FDA 2019). In addition, patients had to be on stable, maximum-tolerated labelled daily dose, of 
ACE-I or ARB for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1, if not medically contraindicated. 
Inclusion criteria 
Key inclusion criteria included:

Evidence of increased albuminuria 3 months or more before Visit 1 and UACR ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g 
at Visit 1 
-  Stable, and for the patient maximum tolerated labelled daily dose, treatment with ACE-I or ARB for at 
least 4 weeks before Visit 1, if not medically contraindicated 
Exclusion criteria

-  New York Heart Association class IV Congestive HF at the time of enrolment 
Medications/Therapies 
All patients were to be treated for CV risk factors (eg, BP, lipids, and antithrombotic treatment), diabetes and 
CKD complications (eg, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperkalaemia, acidosis and renal 
anaemia). 
Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) was, if possible, to be avoided during the 
study. 
Concomitant treatment with open-label SGLT2 inhibitors eg, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, 
ertugliflozin, tofogliflozin and luseogliflozin and fixed-dose combinations containing these drugs was 
prohibited. 
CKD Medication 
To be eligible, the patient needed to be on stable and for the patient maximum tolerated labelled daily dose 
of ACE-I or ARB for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1, if not medically contraindicated. If the patient was not on 
an ACE-I or ARB at the time of enrolment, the reason was to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Details regarding the following CKD related treatments were to be recorded in the eCRF throughout the 
study: 
-  RAAS inhibition: ACE-I/ARBs, renin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid antagonists 
-  Diuretics: Loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics and other diuretics 
- 
- 
- 
Treatment of underlying kidney disease: cytotoxic agents, immunosuppressive agents, other 
immunotherapy 
Phosphate binders 
Potassium binders 
Diabetes Treatment 
Patients with T2DM at randomisation in this study continued their T2DM treatment. Treatment was to be 
based on established guidelines and according to local laboratory values. Patients were eligible for 
adjustments in their anti-diabetes treatment at the discretion of their diabetes health care provider. 
Diabetes medications at baseline and any changes throughout the study, were to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Treatments 
At randomisation, Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 
-  Dapagliflozin 10 mg, given once daily per oral use 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 19/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Placebo – one placebo tablet to match dapagliflozin 10 mg, given once daily per oral use 
Reduction of dose to dapagliflozin 5 mg was permitted if clinically indicated. If the dose was decreased, or 
interrupted, the dose was increased back, or re-introduced, to 10 mg dapagliflozin (or matching placebo), as 
soon as the patient’s condition was stable, in the opinion of the investigator. All patients were required to be 
on current available standard of care treatment for CKD. Therefore, placebo was an appropriate comparator. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To determine if dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the primary composite 
endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), reaching end stage renal 
disease (ESRD), CV or renal death when added to current background therapy in patients with eGFR ≥ 25 
and ≤ 75 mL/min/1.73m2 and albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g).  
Secondary objectives 
To determine whether dapagliflozin compared with placebo will result in a reduction of the incidence of the 
composite endpoints of worsening of renal function. 
To determine whether dapagliflozin compared with placebo will result in a reduction of the incidence of the 
composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalisation for heart failure. 
To determine whether dapagliflozin compared with placebo will result in a reduction of the incidence of 
all-cause mortality. 
Safety objective 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in this patient population.

Definitions and adjudications 
Sustained eGFR decline of ≥ 50% from baseline and sustained eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 were based on 2 
consecutive central laboratory values at least 28 days apart below the respective limit. These endpoints 
were derived from the central laboratory and were not adjudicated. 
The following potential endpoints were recorded in the eCRF and submitted for central adjudication by a CEA 
Committee: all deaths, renal endpoints (dialysis, kidney transplantations, doubling of serum creatinine 
[compared to the most recent central laboratory measurement]), hospitalization for HF, cardiac ischemic 
events, and cerebrovascular events. Chronic dialysis was adjudicated as dialysis treatment ongoing for at 
least 28 days, or when the renal deterioration was deemed irreversible and the dialysis treatment was 
stopped before Day 28. To be included in the primary and secondary efficacy variables, events had to be 
confirmed by the CEA (with the exception of eGFR events). 
Sample size 
The study was event-driven. With an annual event rate of 7.5% in the placebo treatment group, 4000 
patients were estimated to provide the required number of primary events, based on an anticipated 
recruitment period of 24 months and an average follow-up period of approximately 33 months. The assumed 
placebo event rate of 7.5% is based on a review of published data in the CKD population. The number of 
patients with incomplete follow-up of endpoints was expected to be small; hence, these were not considered 
in the determination of the sample size. 
Assuming a true HR of 0.78 between dapagliflozin and placebo, using a one-sided alpha of 2.5%, 681 
primary endpoint events would provide a statistical power of 90% for the test of the primary composite 
endpoint. This was based on an overall 1:1 allocation between dapagliflozin and placebo. The assumed 
hazard ratio of 0.78 is considered as clinically relevant. 
Randomisation 
Randomization of patients was performed using an IxRS in balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 
balance between treatment groups. Patient recruitment was continuously monitored in order to achieve 
adequate proportions of patient subpopulations. Patients were randomized at 386 sites in 21 countries. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily or placebo. 
Randomization was stratified by: 
T2DM status (with or without) at the time of randomization  
• 
•  UACR > 1000 and ≤ 1000 mg/g.  
The number of patients with eGFR 60 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the time of randomization was also monitored 
to ensure that the number of patients in this subpopulation did not exceed approximately 10%. The number 
of randomized patients with and without T2DM was monitored in order to ensure a minimum of 30% in each 
subpopulation. Randomization was capped when the pre-determined limits were reached. Randomization of 
patients based on geographic region was monitored to ensure a global representation. Also, the proportion 
of patients not on ACE-I or ARB at randomization, due to intolerance, was monitored to ensure that the 
target population was reflected with regard to background therapy.

Blinding (masking) 
The blinding of treatment was ensured by using a double-blind technique. The dapagliflozin tablets and the 
respective placebo tablets were identical in size, colour, smell, and taste. The bottles with IP were labelled 
with unique identification numbers. 
No member of the extended MAH study team, site personnel, or any clinical research organization (CRO) 
handling study data had access to the randomization scheme during the study. The MAH personnel or 
delegate generating the randomization scheme and the Supply Chain Study Management were able to 
access the randomization scheme as appropriate. 
Monitoring and adjudication committees 
The Executive Committee was to make recommendations to the MAH with regard to early stopping or 
modifications of the study based on the information received from the DMC.  
The National Lead Investigator (NLI) Committee was comprised of NLIs from each country where the study 
was conducted and was supervised by the Executive Committee. 
An independent Data Monitoring committee (DMC) was appointed and reported to the Executive Committee. 
The DMC was responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients in the study by assessing the safety 
of the IP, and for reviewing the overall conduct of the study. The DMC had access to the individual treatment 
codes and was able to merge these with the collected study data while the study was ongoing. 
The role of the Clinical Event Adjudication (CEA) committee was to independently review, interpret and 
adjudicate potential endpoints experienced by the patients. Endpoints were identified preliminarily by the 
Investigators, and also by the MAH personnel or in the CEA process as specified in the CEA charter. The CEA 
committee members did not have access to individual treatment codes for any patient or clinical efficacy 
endpoint and safety events. The precise responsibilities and procedures applicable for the CEA were detailed 
in the CEA charter. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
All patients who had been randomized to study treatment were included in the full analysis set (FAS) 
irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. Patients were analysed 
according to their randomized IP assignment. 
All patients who received at least one dose of randomized treatment were included in the safety population. 
Patients were analysed according to the treatment actually received. 
Hypothesis 
For the primary endpoint the following hypothesis was tested at the 2.5% one-sided level:  
H0: HR [dapagliflozin:placebo]≥1 versus  
H1: HR [dapagliflozin:placebo]<1. 
For clarity, two-sided p-values were presented in the CSR and the alpha threshold for statistical significance 
used in the confirmatory testing was 0.05 (corresponding to one-sided alpha of 0.025). 
Estimand 
The primary and secondary objectives were evaluated under the treatment policy estimand to reflect the 
effect of the initially assigned randomized study drug, irrespective of adherence to randomized study 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021

treatment. Specifically, the analysis was performed for the full analysis set including all events that occurred 
on or prior to the primary analyses censoring date (PACD), including events following premature 
discontinuation of study drug. 
Primary analysis 
Potential endpoint events and event dates were adjudicated by CEA committee. The eGFR events were not 
adjudicated. The primary variable was time to first event included in the primary composite endpoint. The 
primary analysis was based on the FAS using confirmed or adjudicated events.  
In the analysis of the primary composite endpoint, treatments (dapagliflozin versus placebo) were compared 
using a Cox proportional hazards model with a factor for treatment group, stratified by randomization 
stratification factors (T2D, UACR), and adjusting for eGFR. The event rates (per 100 person-years), p-value, 
hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. In general, the analysis used each 
patient's last contact as the censoring date for patients without any primary events. Deaths adjudicated as 
‘cause undetermined’ with regard to CV death or non-CV death were included in the analyses as CV deaths 
but were not considered as renal deaths. Patients who did not have an endpoint event were censored at the 
earliest of date of withdrawal of consent (WoC) or non-CV death or non-renal death when applicable, and 
otherwise at the earliest of date of last clinical event assessment and PACD. 
The contribution of each component of the primary composite endpoint to the overall treatment effect was 
examined. The first event of the given type was included irrespectively of any preceding non-fatal composite 
event of a different type. Methods similar to those described for the primary analysis were used to 
separately analyse the time from randomization to the first occurrence of each component of the primary 
composite endpoint. Last contact was treated as the censoring date for patients without the endpoint of 
interest. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence to the first occurrence of any event in the 
primary endpoint were calculated and plotted, for overall analysis and for the individual components. 
Sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary endpoint 1) excluding chronic dialysis events ongoing 
less than 90 days, and 2) where deaths adjudicated as ‘undetermined’ cause were not included as CV deaths 
but treated as censoring events.  
No hazard ratio estimates with confidence interval and p-values were given when less than 15 events in 
total, both treatment groups combined. 
Missing data 
The time-to-event analysis using the Cox regression depends on the assumption of non-informative or 
ignorable censoring, corresponding to the missing at random assumption. The missing data in this context 
were patients who were prematurely censored due to WoC, lost to follow-up or otherwise incomplete 
follow-up of endpoints. The amount of missing data was described e.g., in terms of the number of patients 
and patient time with incomplete follow-up. To assess the impact of missing data and the robustness of the 
results with regard to the assumption of non-informative censoring, sensitivity analysis was based on the 
evaluation of the missing follow-up and discussed in relation to the observed efficacy signal. This could 
include analysis where scenarios in terms of increased risk in censored patients were explored to identify a 
‘tipping point’ where statistical significance would be lost. 
Secondary and subgroup analyses 
The secondary variables were analysed in the similar manner as the primary variable. Subgroup variables for 
the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints included demography (age, sex, race, 
geographic region) and baseline disease characteristics (T2D, UACR, eGFR, and Systolic blood pressure). 
Interim analysis 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 24/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An interim analysis was initially planned to be performed when 75% of the primary endpoints were 
adjudicated, using a Haybittle-Peto rule. However, the interim analysis was removed in accordance with 
protocol version 4.0 dated 17 March 2020. 
On 26 March 2020, the DMC held a regular review meeting to assess data. Based on their review, the DMC 
recommended that the study be stopped early on the basis of positive efficacy results. The Executive 
Committee together with the MAH decided on 2 April 2020 to set the study end date (and the PACD) to 3 
April 2020. 
Multiplicity 
A closed testing procedure of the primary and secondary endpoints was utilized in a pre-specified 
hierarchical order as given in the Outcomes/endpoints section. The Type I error was initially planned to be 
controlled at a one-sided 0.02496 level for multiplicity in consideration of the planned interim analysis. Since 
the interim analysis was removed, in accordance with protocol version 4.0, the alpha level was updated for 
the final analysis. The Type I error was controlled at a one-sided 0.025 level for multiplicity across the 
primary and the 3 secondary endpoints. 
Retrospective evaluation 
It was recognised that the informal analysis by the DMC and the unplanned early stop led to multiplicity. The 
MAH provided the following framework in order to assist with statistical interpretation of the efficacy results. 
1)  Primary endpoint  
When evaluating the efficacy data in March 2020, the DMC referred to Haybittle-Peto boundary as the 
statistical criterion for the primary endpoint, in their deliberation leading to the recommendation for early 
stop. Although not considered to be required by the MAH, the same Haybittle-Peto boundary was prudent to 
use in evaluating the primary endpoint in the retrospective setting.  
2)  Secondary endpoints 
Hung et al 2007 (Hung et al 2007) and Glimm et al 2010 (Glimm et al 2010) illustrated the complexity 
associated with the MTP for secondary endpoints, in a group sequential design (GSD), when the stopping 
criteria were primarily based on the primary endpoint. In particular, the FWER increases with higher 
correlation between the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoint(s). The FWER is also dependent on 
the magnitude of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint. Hung et al illustrated that using the full alpha 
does not always ensure strong control of the FWER, while using the same critical value (threshold) as in the 
stopping criteria for the primary endpoint is overly conservative and with reduced power. Glimm et al 
provided a general framework and benchmark for deriving MTP. The MAH adopted a framework similar to 
Glimm et al for the retrospective evaluation while recognising that their work was in the context of 
prospective GSD designs. The MAH claimed that a two-sided alpha threshold of 0.03 would ensure strong 
control of FWER, accounting for 3 analyses: DMC informal analysis for the primary endpoint only (408 
primary endpoint events), current analysis (509 primary endpoint events) and planned final analysis (681 
primary endpoint events). This result was conservatively based on the correlation of 0.87 between the 
primary endpoint and first secondary endpoint in testing hierarchy which was modelled as being 
approximately equal to the square root of the proportion of the joint events in the primary and first 
secondary endpoint (385 1st secondary endpoint events/509 primary endpoint events). It was presented 
that the maximum FWER associated with a threshold of 0.03 is 0.4984 (two-sided).  
In conclusion, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint results as reported in the CSR were statistically 
significant based on the pre-specified procedure as described in the SAP, and when the MAH’s threshold of 
0.03 was applied for ensuring FWER at two-sided 0.05. 
Safety analyses 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 25/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety analyses were performed by means of descriptive statistics using both on treatment observations and 
using all observations regardless of whether patients are on or off study treatment. 
Changes to the pre-specified analyses 
No changes to the analyses were made after the unblinding of study data. 
The statistical analyses were performed according to the SAP version 2 (15 April 2020) after DBL (17 July 
2020). The first SAP was authored prior to first patient enrolled. The major change in the SAP version 2 was 
removal of the pre-planned interim analyses as described above.  
According to the first SAP version, the study had a group sequential design study with an interim analysis 
that would assess superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo on a one-sided alpha level of 0.001. If superiority 
was achieved, the DMC would evaluate the totality of the efficacy data, in particular ESRD and mortality, and 
safety data, to determine if benefit is unequivocal and overwhelming such that the DMC recommends ending 
the study. If the study was stopped for superiority, then testing of secondary endpoints would continue down 
the hierarchy at one-sided significance level 0.001. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 7517 patients were enrolled, 4304 patients were randomized, and 4289 patients completed the 
study. The median time in study until PACD was 27.6 months (range 0.1 to 38.2 months), and median time 
in study until last visit was 28.5 months (range 0.3 to 39.2 months). In total, 11 (0.3%) patients withdrew 
consent during the study and the proportions of patients who withdrew consent were balanced between 
treatment groups. Overall, 15 patients discontinued the study (10 in dapagliflozin, 5 in placebo). Vital status 
was unknown for 5 patients in total. There were 2142 (99.5%) and 2147 (99.8%) patients who completed 
the study in the dapagliflozin and placebo arms, respectively (Figure 3). 
In total, few (13.5%) patients prematurely and permanently discontinued IP, with similar proportions in the 
dapagliflozin group (12.7%) and the placebo group (14.4%).  
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 405 sites across 21 countries, and patients were randomized at 386 sites. The 
first patient was enrolled on 02 February 2017. Study closure visits started after the study end date (SED), 
which was also the primary analysis censoring date (PACD) for efficacy analyses (including events occurring 
on or prior to that date). On 02 April 2020, the PACD was set to 03 April 2020 by the executive committee. 
The last patient completed the last visit on 12 June 2020, and the database was locked on 17 July 2020.

Protocols deviations 
Important protocol deviations are summarized in Table 2. Overall, 2.6% of the patients had 1 or more 
important protocol deviation. The most frequent important protocol deviation was failed inclusion criteria 
related to stable ACE-I or ARB treatment, reported for in total 47 patients (1.1%) and equally distributed 
between treatment groups. The number of subjects with important protocol deviations in each treatment 
group was balanced with respect to both frequency and type of protocol deviations. All important protocol 
deviations were reviewed and agreed before database lock.

Interim Analysis 
The original DAPA-CKD CSP included a planned interim analysis at 75% of endpoint events. The MAH took 
the decision to remove the planned interim analysis on 05 March 2020 as the anticipated timing of the 
planned interim analysis was expected to be close to the planned study end date and there was concern 
relating to the potential impact of the developing COVID-19 pandemic on study close-out. The DMC was 
informed of this decision on 11 March 2020, and CSP Version 4.0 was finalized on 17 March 2020. CSP 
amendment 4 removed text relating to the planned interim analysis and updated the statistical testing level 
for endpoints at the final analysis to 2.5% from 2.496%. 
Early Stop 
On 26 March 2020, the DMC held a regular review meeting to assess data. Based on their review, the DMC 
recommended that the study be stopped early on the basis of positive efficacy results. The decision was 
made public on 30 March 2020. The Executive Committee together with the MAH decided on 2 April 2020 to 
set the SED to 3 April 2020. The final database contained a total of 509 primary endpoint events in the FAS 
versus the originally planned 681 primary endpoint events. 
Covid-19 
Deviations from the clinical study protocol, procedures and guidance’s due to COVID 19 were recorded in the 
CTMS. By DBL, a total of 2800 deviations related to COVID-19 had been reported. A listing by country, site, 
patient, treatment code, and category is provided in the clinical study report. None of the COVID-19-related 
protocol deviations were categorised as an important protocol deviation. Deviations were in general evenly 
distributed between treatment groups.  
Baseline data 
Patient demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups. In the overall patient 
population, 66.9% of patients were male, mean age was 61.8 years, and 57.8% were ≤ 65 and 42.2% were 
> 65 years old. Patients were randomized worldwide, with 28.6% of patients randomized in Europe, 18.9% 
in North America, 21.2% in Latin/South America, and 31.3% in Asia. Of the total study population, 53.2% of 
patients were White, 34.1% were Asian, and 4.4% were Black or African-American. 
In total, 67.5% of patients in the study had T2DM and 32.5% did not have diabetes. There were equal 
proportions of patients with T2DM in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Patient 
demographics and baseline subject characteristics in subgroups of patients with T2DM and patients without 
diabetes are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.

General patient characteristics and characteristics related to CKD, at baseline, are summarized in (Table 6). 
At baseline, mean eGFR was 43.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, 14.5% of patients had eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 
58.6% of patients had eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Median UACR was 949.3 mg/g and 51.7% of patients 
had UACR ≤ 1000 mg/g. Mean SBP was 137.1 mmHg. 
The most common investigator judged causes of CKD were as follows: diabetic nephropathy (58.3%), 
hypertension (16.0%), and chronic glomerulonephritis (16.1%). 
Concomitant Medication 
All patients were to be treated for CV risk factors, diabetes and CKD complications during the study. At 
randomization, 97.0% of patients were treated with ACE-I or ARB and 94.1% of patients with T2DM were 
treated with diabetes medications. Overall, the most commonly used CV medications were: ACE-I (31.5%) 
or ARB (66.7%), lipid lowering agents (69.4%), calcium channel blockers (50.7%), and antithrombotic 
agents (47.4%). The most commonly used diabetes medication was insulin (55.4%). 
The use of ACE-I and ARB after randomization was high and remained stable throughout the trial.

Any use of systemic glucocorticoids during the study was less common in patients treated with dapagliflozin 
(6.9%) compared with placebo (8.2%) but use of other immunosuppressive treatment was overall balanced 
between treatment groups. 
A total of 34 (0.8%) patients were treated with open-label SGLT2 inhibitors during the study, of which 14 
cases were classified as prohibited medication use (ie, taken concomitantly with IP) and reported as 
important protocol deviations. The use of prohibited medications was balanced between treatment groups. 
Treatment Compliance 
Compliance with the randomised study drug was high and similar between treatment groups. Median (IQR) 
compliance was 98.6% (96.0 to 99.9%) and 98.6% (95.5 to 99.9%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively. In the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 82.9% and 80.2% of patients, respectively, had a 
compliance of > 80%, and 77.7% and 74.6%, respectively, had a compliance of > 90%. If information 
regarding the number of tablets dispensed or the number of tablets returned was missing for at least one 
observation, compliance was not calculated for that subject. If physical return of tablets was not possible 
due to remote SCV during the COVID-19 pandemic, information regarding compliance was collected 
verbally. 
Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets and the number of subjects in each analysis set are summarized in Table 7.  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomised patients assessed according to their randomised study 
drug assignment (2152 patients in in each treatment arm). 6 patients did not receive IP and were therefore 
excluded from the safety analysis set (SAS). All decisions on the inclusion or exclusion of subjects from 
analyses were made while the data were still blinded. 
All patients who were randomized to study treatment were included in the FAS irrespective of their protocol 
adherence and continued participation in the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
Summary of Testing Hierarchy and Overall Efficacy Results 
The study met the primary and secondary objectives. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the 
incidence of the composite of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD, and renal or CV death. All 
components contributed to the observed treatment effect. Demonstration of superiority for the primary 
efficacy endpoint initiated sequential testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints, see overview of

confirmatory analysis in Table 8. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for the reduction of all the secondary 
endpoints: (1) renal composite endpoint without CV death, (2) composite of CV death and hospitalisation for 
HF, and (3) all-cause mortality.

Primary Outcome: Composite of ≥ 50% Sustained Decline in eGFR, ESRD, and Renal or CV Death 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the primary composite 
endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD, and renal or CV death (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.51, 0.72], 
p < 0.0001) ( 
Table 9). There were 197 and 312 patients with any event of the composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 4.6 and 7.5. The 
contributing events analysis showed that the treatment effect on the primary composite was not driven by 
first events of ≥ 50% eGFR decline alone. 
The KM curves of the primary endpoint for placebo and dapagliflozin groups began to separate early (4 
months) and continued to separate over the course of the study (Figure 4). The number needed to treat per 
27 months was 19 (95% CI 15, 27).

Table 9). The benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint consisted of reductions in the incidence of the 
single components ≥ 50% eGFR sustained decline (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.42, 0.67]) (Figure 4 and  
Table 9), ESRD (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.50, 0.82]) ( 
Table 9 and Figure 4), and CV death (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.58, 1.12]) (see Table 5 and Figure 5). Renal 
deaths were few, 8 events in total (2 in dapagliflozin, 6 in placebo group) and therefore not analysed as an 
individual component, in accordance with the statistical analysis plan which specified that only events > 15 
in total were to be analysed. (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.58, 1.12]) ( 
Table 9 and Figure 4). Renal deaths were few, 8 events in total (2 in dapagliflozin, 6 in placebo group) and 
therefore not analysed as an individual component, in accordance with the statistical analysis plan which 
specified that only events > 15 in total were to be analysed.

Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the composite of ≥ 50% sustained decline 
in eGFR, ESRD, and renal death (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.45, 0.68], p < 0.0001) (Table 8). There were 142 and 
243 patients with any event of the composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, 
corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 3.3 and 5.8. The results for this secondary endpoint 
were consistent with those for the primary endpoint. The KM curves began to separate early and continued 
to separate over the course of the study (Figure 7). The single components of the composite endpoint are 
discussed above. 
Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Composite of ≥ 50% eGFR Decline, ESRD and Renal Death (FAS) 
Secondary Outcome: Composite of CV Death and Hospitalisation for Heart Failure 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for the reduction of the composite of CV death and hospitalisation for 
HF (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.55, 0.92]) (Table 8). There were 100 and 138 patients with any event of the 
composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 
100 patient-years of 2.2 and 3.0. The curves of the KM plot for placebo and dapagliflozin groups for this 
endpoint began to separate early and continued to separate over the course of the study, however crossing 
of KM curves towards the end of the study occurred due to high censoring rate and small number of patients 
at risk (Figure 8). 
Both components contributed to the treatment effect on the composite endpoint. The incidence of the single 
component hospitalisation for HF was reduced in the dapagliflozin group, compared with placebo (HR 0.51

[95% CI 0.34, 0.76]). The incidence of CV death as a single component was numerically reduced by 
dapagliflozin (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.58, 1.12]), (Table 8). 
Secondary Outcome: Death from Any Cause 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing all-cause mortality (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.53, 0.88]) (Table 
8). There were 101 and 146 deaths in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to 
event rates per 100 patient-years of 2.2 and 3.1. The curves of the KM plot for placebo and dapagliflozin 
groups for all-cause mortality began to separate early and continued to separate over the course of the 
study (Figure 9). 
Adjudicated death causes are presented in Table 10. The benefit of dapagliflozin on all-cause mortality was 
driven by reductions in both deaths from non-CV causes (mainly infections, malignancies, renal deaths) and 
deaths from CV causes (mainly HF). Deaths of undetermined causes also contributed to the overall effect. 
Overall, the most common cause of death in the study was non-CV deaths (102 in total, 36 in dapagliflozin, 
66 in placebo). Of the non-CV deaths, the most common categories were deaths due to infections (46 in 
total; 18 in dapagliflozin, 28 in placebo), malignancies (27 in total; 8 in dapagliflozin, 19 in placebo) and 
renal deaths (8 in total; 2 in dapagliflozin, 6 in placebo). In total, there were 91 cases of CV deaths (41 in 
dapagliflozin, 50 in placebo), of which there were 51 patients with sudden cardiac death and 14 cases of 
deaths due to HF. In total, 54 deaths were categorised as of undetermined cause (24 in dapagliflozin, 30 in 
placebo). 
Dapagliflozin reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESRD (in total 270; 109 in dapagliflozin, 
161 in placebo) ( 
Table 9), and in these patients deaths from all causes were more frequent (15.9%) than in the overall study

Exploratory Variables 
UACR (Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) 
A greater reduction in UACR for dapagliflozin compared to placebo that was observed from 14 days and 
onwards. At 36 months, the adjusted mean percent change from baseline in UACR (mg/g) was -41.1% in 
patients treated with dapagliflozin and -20.08% in patients treated with placebo, giving a difference between 
treatment groups of -26.31% ([95% CI -36.82, -14.04]) (Figure 11) 
Figure 10: Adjusted Mean Percent Change from Baseline UACR and 95% CIs from Repeated Measures 
Model (FAS) 
Doubling of Serum Creatinine 
Doubling of serum creatinine was used as an estimate of the effect on acute kidney injury. Dapagliflozin 
reduced the incidence of time to first doubling of serum creatinine levels compared to placebo (HR 0.68 
[95% CI 0.49, 0.94]). 
eGFR 
There was an initial drop in eGFR in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo. Thereafter, the rate of 
decline in renal function was reduced in the dapagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. Thereafter, 
the rate of decline in renal function was reduced in the dapagliflozin group compared to the placebo group 
(Figure 12). 
Dapagliflozin reduced events of ≥ 30% eGFR decline (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.67, 0.87]) and ≥ 40% eGFR 
decline (HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.53, 0.74]) compared to placebo). This reduction was consistent with events of 
≥ 50% decline in eGFR, as a single component of the primary composite endpoint ( 
Table 9).

Analysis of the proportion of patients with eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 that entered CKD stage 4, (sustained 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), showed that dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of patients that reached 
CKD4, compared with placebo, with an odds ratio of 0.59 ([95% CI 0.44, 0.80]) 
Figure 11: Adjusted Mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) Change from Baseline and 95% CIs from Repeated Measures 
Model (FAS) 
SBP 
Analysis of change from baseline in SBP showed that dapagliflozin reduced SBP during the study, from the 
timepoint of 14 days into the study to 36 months, with a mean difference between treatment groups ranging 
from -2.21 to -3.68 mmHg. 
HbA1c 
In the T2DM population, analysis of percent change from baseline in HbA1c from the timepoint of 14 days 
into the study until 16 months showed a greater reduction in HbA1c for dapagliflozin compared to placebo; 
the mean difference between treatment groups ranged from -0.05 to -0.24. There were no significant 
differences in HbA1c between dapagliflozin and placebo from the timepoint of 20 months to 36 months in the 
study. 
Body weight 
Analysis of change from baseline in body weight over time showed a greater reduction in weight for 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo, from the timepoint of 14 days into the study until 36 months. At 36 
months, the mean change from baseline in weight was -1.73 kg in patients treated with dapagliflozin and 
-0.93 kg in patients treated with placebo, giving a difference between treatment groups of -0.80 (95% CI 
-1.47, -0.14)

Two questionnaires were used to collect PRO data in the study, KDQOL™-36 and EQ-5D-5L. No significant 
differences in the above-mentioned scores were noted at baseline between the dapagliflozin and the placebo 
groups. At 12, 24 and 36 months, no clinically relevant changes compared to baseline were seen for either 
group.

(including components) by T2DM status (FAS) 
According to the investigator’s clinical judgement, the most likely aetiology of CKD was recorded at baseline. 
Subgroup analyses of aetiologies of CKD showed that dapagliflozin’s treatment benefit observed on the 
primary endpoint was consistent across different aetiologies (Table 12).

The benefit of dapagliflozin on the secondary endpoint renal composite without CV death was consistent 
between subgroups of patients with T2DM (HR 0.57 [95% CI 0.45, 0.73]) and without diabetes (HR 0.51 
[95% CI 0.34, 0.75]) and results were consistent with those of the primary endpoint (Figure 13). For results 
on components of this secondary composite endpoint, see Table 11.

The benefit of dapagliflozin on the incidence of the composite of CV death and hospitalisation for HF was 
consistent in subgroups of patients with T2DM and without diabetes (Figure 13). The incidence of this 
composite was reduced by dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.53, 0.92]), and both 
components contributed to the overall effect (Table 9). In patients without diabetes, events of the composite 
of CV death and hospitalisation for HF were few but numerically reduced by dapagliflozin (15 in dapagliflozin, 
19 in placebo) (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.40, 1.55]) (Table 13).

Death from Any Cause 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the incidence of the secondary endpoint all-cause mortality was consistent in 
subgroups of patients with T2DM (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.56, 0.98]) and without diabetes (HR 0.52 [95% CI 
0.29, 0.93]) (Figure 13). There were 197 deaths in the T2DM subgroup (84 in dapagliflozin, 113 in placebo), 
corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 2.6 and 3.5, respectively. In the subgroup of patients 
without diabetes there were 50 deaths (17 in dapagliflozin, 33 in placebo), corresponding to event rates per 
100 patient-years of 1.2 and 2.3, respectively. 
Efficacy by Baseline and Demographic Characteristics 
Composite of ≥ 50% Sustained Decline in eGFR, ESRD, and Renal or CV Death 
The benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint was generally consistent across subgroups based on 
baseline demographic and renal variables, including age (≤ 65, > 65 years), eGFR (< 30, ≥ 30, < 45, ≥ 45 
mL/min/1.73m2), and UACR (≤ 1000, > 1000 mg/g). A significant interaction p-value was observed for SBP 
subgroups (≤ 130 mmHg, > 130 mmHg), but both subgroups displayed a positive treatment effect (Error!

Superiority 
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on renal 
outcomes and CV mortality in patients with CKD. The rationale for the study 
was the growing body of evidence that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibition is nephroprotective in patients with T2DM, and the available 
data suggesting that patients without T2DM would also benefit from 
SGLT2 inhibition.

4.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The DAPA-CKD study was an international, multicentre, event-driven, randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo, given 
once daily in addition to standard of care, to prevent the progression of CKD and renal or CV death. 
The study population consisted of adult patients with CKD (eGFR ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
evidence of increased albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g), with 
type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or without diabetes. In addition, patients had to be on stable, maximum-tolerated 
labelled daily dose, of ACE-I or ARB for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1, if not medically contraindicated. 
Of note, only patients with overt albuminuria levels ≥200 mg/g have been included in the study. A lower 
inclusion limit of UACR 200 mg/g in the Dapa-CKD study was agreed within an EMA scientific advice, as a 
prognostic enrichment strategy to select patients at higher risk of experiencing a disease related-endpoint 
event and not due to any expectation that dapagliflozin would have less efficacy in patients without 
albuminuria. 
Data from the DECLARE trial on patients with T2D, with and without albuminuria but without CKD is 
considered supportive data, but data on patients with T2D and CKD without albuminuria is rather limited, 
especially in patients with CKD categories 3-4. Additional data on the effect of dapagliflozin on the treatment 
of CKD on patients without diabetes and without albuminuria has not been provided. Treatment with 
dapagliflozin may provide a potential benefit for patients with CKD that has not yet developed albuminuria, 
but data in this patient group is scarce.  
Addition descriptive analyses of the effect of UACR as a mediator of treatment effects on kidney outcomes 
shows that a substantial non-albumin-mediated treatment effect can be seen in the subgroup of patients 
with nondiabetic etiologies of CKD. Together with the knowledge of effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors on the 
pathophysiological mechanisms leading to CKD, it seems plausible that patients without albuminuria might 
benefit from treatment with dapagliflozin (albeit likely to a less extent). The Applicant was therefore 
requested to include in section 4.4 of the SmPC that there is no experience with dapagliflozin for the 
treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients without diabetes who do not have albuminuria. Patients with 
albuminuria may benefit more, as this information is of importance to the prescriber. 
Patients with known polycystic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis with flares (lupus or ANCA-associated 
vasculitis), ongoing active renal inflammation or T1D were excluded. For patients with T2D, changes to 
diabetes treatment following recommendation by clinical guidelines were allowed, for all drugs but for those 
containing SGLT-2 inhibitor other than the IP, which were prohibited. CKD treatment as recommended by 
clinical guidelines, if not medically contraindicated, was mandatory.

The 10 mg dapagliflozin dose choice was based on efficacy/safety data in the T2D population as well as 
population with HFrEF. Furthermore, in a previous study in patients with CKD stage 3 (eGFR 30 to 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2) the dose was found to be well tolerated. Background medication in both study groups 
included available standard CKD treatment. Reduction of dapagliflozin to 5mg was temporally allowed, if 
clinically indicated. 
The study was event-driven, with an anticipated duration was ca 45 months, when the predetermined 
number of primary endpoints (n=681) was predicted to have occurred. The sample size was calculated to 
4000 patients in order to detect 681 events of the primary endpoint (≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, 
ESRD, CV death or renal death). The MAH took the decision to amend the study protocol to remove the 
planned interim analysis when 75% of endpoint events were reached. An independent DMC recommended 
the premature study stop based on positive efficacy results in an informal review when 408 primary endpoint 
events were observed. This was contemplated in the original study protocol. The study end date was set to 
3 April 2020. The final database included 509 events, instead of the 681 primary endpoints events initially 
calculated.   
Stratification factors were T2DM status and UACR. The number of randomized patients was monitored in 
order to ensure specific predefined size of the subgroups in respect to eGFR, tolerability to ACE-I/ARB and 
geographic location at the time of randomization. 
Primary and secondary endpoints seem appropriate. Of note, the primary efficacy outcome is similar to the 
one used in the Credence trial, but with the inclusion of patient with and without type2 diabetes. Secondary 
efficacy outcomes include several CV endpoints, relevant to the population with CKD and high CV risk 
included. According to the applicant, the primary outcome was chosen based on the requirements as 
outlined in the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products to prevent development/slow 
progression of chronic renal insufficiency. 
All amendments were made after the start of patient recruitment. Of note, two new exploratory objectives 
were added on January the 22nd, 2020: To determine whether dapagliflozin compared with placebo will 
result in a reduction in the incidence of the composite endpoint of chronic dialysis, renal death or receiving 
a renal transplant; To determine whether dapagliflozin compared with placebo will result in a reduction in the 
incidence of the composite endpoint of CV death, MI or stroke. 
None of the amendments is thought to significantly influence the interpretation of the efficacy and safety 
outcomes, except for the removal of the interim analysis. Additionally, there were few protocol deviations 
and equally distributed between the study groups. 
In summary, the study design and study conduct are generally endorsed. The randomization and blinding 
procedures are considered acceptable.  
Statistical methods applied are in general acceptable. Given the compelling efficacy results, the decision for 
early stop seems reasonable, however, without any consideration of its impact on evaluability of the safety 
data (particularly adverse events of special interest, e.g. related to lower limb amputation) and disregarding 
from the issues raised below. 
The informal analyses by the DMC that triggered the early stop was based on 408 events of the composite 
primary endpoint, i.e. prior to the initially planned interim analysis that was to be performed when 75% of 
the primary events were adjudicated. According to the SAP version 1, there was one planned interim 
analysis, with the possibility of the DMC to do subsequent interim analysis if they deem necessary, and no 
efficacy analysis was mentioned to be performed by the DMC prior to the first planned interim analysis. It is 
acknowledged that the CSP stated that the study may be terminated early if either a clear beneficial or 
harmful effect of the study treatment is detected during the DMC review, but performing unplanned interim 
analysis is problematic in multiple aspects. According to the first SAP version, one-sided alpha level of 0.001 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 59/116 
 
 
 
 
 
was to be assigned at the interim analysis and significance level for the final analysis would be determined 
by the Haybittle-Peto function based on the actual number and timing of interim analyses. Thus, if the 
current analysis would have been regarded as the planned interim analysis, then the hierarchical testing 
procedure for the primary and secondary endpoints should have been performed at one-sided significance 
level of 0.001. The circumstances around the early stop were clarified by the MAH on request. The DMC 
meeting minutes showed that the decision to perform an inferential efficacy analysis prior to the planned 
interim analysis was made by the DMC well in advance of amending the protocol (version 4). However, the 
decision to perform an early efficacy analysis was made based on descriptive statistics for the primary 
composite endpoint (unblinded data), which was not part of the safety review according to the DMC charter, 
and the rationale for the MAH’s decision to remove the interim analysis in the protocol version 4 is unclear. 
The reason for the decision by the MAH to follow the recommendation by the DMC to stop the study early has 
not been addressed. The unplanned early stop has therefore implications on the interpretation of statistical 
significance of the primary and secondary endpoints, and the appropriate way of presentation of these 
endpoints in the SmPC.  
Following the protocol version 4, and after the decision to prematurely stop the study, the MAH had updated 
the SAP by simply removing the interim analysis, and applying significance level of one sided 0.025 to test 
the primary and the secondary endpoints in the hierarchical procedure, with no handling of multiplicity 
caused by the informal analysis (one or multiple) by the DMC and the unplanned early stop, despite knowing 
that the study was terminated early. Also, the study has been described as an event-driven study with 681 
primary endpoint events required for the primary analysis, while the current analysis comprises 509 events 
and as such, cannot be regarded as the final analysis with hypotheses tested on one-sided significance level 
of 0.025 as described in the SAP. The MAH approached this multiplicity issue retrospectively, in the CSR. In 
a retrospective evaluation of multiplicity, the MAH considered applying the stringent Haybittle-Peto 
boundary of 0.001 one-sided for the primary endpoint, while for the 3 secondary endpoints, the framework 
similar to Glimm et al 2010 was adopted to show that a two-sided alpha threshold of 0.03 would ensure 
strong control of FWER, accounting for 3 analyses: DMC informal analysis for the primary endpoint only, 
current analysis and planned final analysis. Without further in-dept assessment of the framework presented, 
the value of the multiplicity handling diminishes due to being presented retrospectively and due to the 
uncertainties around the informal statistical analyses performed by the DMC. It is expected that, at least, the 
initially planned Haybittle-Peto rule would have been applied in the hierarchical testing procedure, i.e. with 
the current analysis considered as interim, using one-sided significance level of 0.001 (i.e. 0.002 two-sided). 
In this respect, we may base the interpretation of the study results on a 0.002 threshold for p-values in the 
hierarchical procedure, which means that only the primary and the first secondary endpoint are considered 
as statistically significant when adjusting for multiplicity. Considering the MAH’s clarification of the 
circumstances around the early stop, there was no doubt that the early efficacy analysis, performed prior to 
the planned interim analysis, was triggered primarily by the (unblinded) observed data.  
Of note, two-sided p-values are presented in the CSR and the alpha threshold for statistical significance in 
the confirmatory testing was 0.05, while the SAP only mentions one-sided alpha of 0.025. 
Regarding missing data, incomplete follow-up (due to any reason) of the primary endpoint accounted for 
approximately 6% of the total person time. The extent of incomplete follow-up was balanced between 
treatment groups and was overwhelmingly driven by missing eGFR samples (due to any reason, including 
COVID-19). Related to the Kaplan-Meier analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, the numbers of 
censored observations due to different reasons were presented for each endpoint. For the primary endpoint 
and the secondary renal endpoint, the majority of events censored before study end date (approximately 
19%) were due to missing eGFR sample after study end. Censoring prior to the primary analysis censoring 
date was well balanced between the treatment groups.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study was conducted at 405 sites across 21 countries, and patients were randomized at 386 sites. 
28.6% of patients randomised in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is thought not to have meaningfully 
impacted the overall quality of the study and the interpretation of the results. 
Demographics, baseline patient characteristics and medical history were generally balanced between 
treatment groups. Baseline medication use was representative of standard of care for CKD and CV disease. 
At baseline, 67.5% of patients in the study had T2DM, being diabetic nephropathy the most common cause 
of CKD (58.3%). 97.0% of patients were treated with ACE-I or ARB and 94% of patients with T2DM were 
treated with diabetes medications. 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomised patients assessed according to their randomised study 
drug assignment (2152 patients in in each treatment arm). 6 patients did not receive IP and were therefore 
excluded from the safety analysis set (SAS). 
Compliance with the study drug was high and similar between treatment groups, almost 100%. Under 
COVID-19 pandemic, information regarding compliance was collected verbally if physical visits were not 
possible. 
The study met its primary outcome, as dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (≥ 
50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD, and renal or CV death) compared to placebo. The primary composite 
event rate was 7,5 in the placebo arm and 4,6 in the dapagliflozin arm, yielding a hazard ration of 0.61 
(p<0.0001). The KM curves of the primary endpoint for placebo and dapagliflozin groups began to separate 
early (4 months) and continued to separate over the course of the study. The number needed to treat per 27 
months was 19. 
All components of the primary composite favoured the dapagliflozin group; however, the treatment effect 
was mainly driven by the components ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR and ESRD. For the component renal 
death, only eight events were reported in total, six for placebo and two for dapagliflozin. The component CV 
death was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin arm. 
Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the secondary renal composite endpoint of ≥ 50% Sustained Decline in 
eGFR, ESRD, and Renal Death vs placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (p<0.0001). The KM curves began to 
separate early and continued to separate over the course of the study. 
Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the secondary CV composite endpoint of CV Death and Hospitalisation for 
Heart Failure, with a hazard ration of 0.7. The KM curves began to separate early and continued to separate 
over the course of the study. Of note, the number of events increased in the dapagliflozin group towards the 
end of the study, while it was kept constant in the placebo group. 
The incidence of hospitalisation for HF was reduced in the dapagliflozin group (HR 0.51) vs placebo while the 
incidence of CV death as a single component was only numerically reduced. 
Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the secondary endpoint Death from Any Cause, with a hazard ratio of 0.7. 
The KM curves began to separate early and continued to separate over the course of the study. A reduction 
in both CV (mainly HF) and non-CV causes (mainly infections, malignancies, renal deaths) was seen. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with a greater reduction in UACR. The difference between 
groups was clinically relevant and was maintained throughout the duration of the study.  
Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of time to first doubling of serum creatinine levels compared to placebo. 
The observed initial drop in eGFR in the dapagliflozin group as compared with placebo is consistent with the 
known mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors. After the initial drop, the decline in eGFR was slower in the 
dapagliflozin group. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 61/116 
 
 
 
 
 
A minor reduction in HbA1c (-0.05 to -0.24 %) was observed in the T2DM population. Indeed, a significant 
change in HbA1c was not expected, as the glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin is eGFR dependent, 
thereby low in this population with reduced kidney function.  
In line with previous observations, a minor reduction in body weight was observed after 36 months of 
treatment with dapagliflozin (-0.8 kg) as compared to placebo. 
Dapagliflozin effect on the primary endpoint was independent of diabetes status at baseline. The KM curves 
began to separate earlier in the group with diabetes (4 months) vs is those without diabetes (8 months) and 
continue to separate throughout the rest of the study. The composite without CV death (≥ 50% Sustained 
Decline in eGFR, ESRD and Renal Death) was also consistent with the primary endpoint, irrespective of 
diabetes diagnose.   
As expected, the event rate of the primary composite endpoint in patients with diabetes was higher (placebo 
8.0 vs dapa 5.2) than those without diabetes (placebo 6.3 vs dapa 3.4). The hazard ratio was similar, 
independent of diabetes status (diabetes 0.6 vs w/o diabetes 0.5). All components of the composite 
contributed to the treatment effect, irrespective of diabetes status at baseline. 
A similar reduction of the primary composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin group was seen independent of the 
aetiology of kidney disease. However, other causes of CKD such as inflammatory and immunological were 
excluded from the study. 
The Applicant has further justified why ongoing or recent requirements of immunomodulating or cytotoxic 
therapies for primary and secondary renal diseases within 6 months of enrolment were actively excluded 
from the study (for practical and safety reasons, as this patients often require intense and sometimes 
prolonged courses of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy or other immunotherapy that 
could bias the study results). Besides, the Applicant elaborates on the fact that treatment with SGLT2 
inhibitors in PKD patients lacks strong rationale, as dapagliflozin has not been shown to affect cyst growth. 
Additional analyses of the primary endpoint by investigator judged CKD aetiology points towards a 
consistent treatment benefits across all included aetiologies, including chronic glomerulonephritis. Even 
though no firm conclusion can be drawn from smaller subgroup analyses due to the low number of patients, 
a numerical benefit in favour of dapagliflozin can be seen in most subgroups. 
The reason for not including patients with active inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatments in this 
clinical trial is accepted, so is the exclusion of patients with PKD. The fact that the pathophysiology of CKD 
in these aetiologies share the same mechanism, namely glomerular hyperfiltration, makes dapagliflozin a 
plausible drug candidate, even if data from the Dapa-CKD study concerning these aetiologies is very limited. 
The exclusion of patients with T1D is acknowledged and the proposed addition of text to SmPC section 4.4 
is accepted.  
Of note, roughly 200 patients with diabetes in each treatment group were not judged to have diabetic 
nephropathy as the main cause of their kidney disease. 
The Applicant has reviewed data for the primary and secondary endpoints in the type2 diabetes patient 
population according to the adjudicated cause of their CKD aetiology. The fact that there were few events in 
the non-DKD group for the all endpoints limits the interpretation of the data. The treatment effect of 
dapagliflozin seems to be consistent between the CKD aetiology categories diabetic and non-diabetic 
nephropathy for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. Furthermore, there is no sign of negative 
effect of dapagliflozin in the non-diabetic nephropathy population.   
The incidence of the secondary outcome composite CV Death and Hospitalisation for Heart Failure was 
reduced in patients with diabetes (HR 0,70) as well as in patients without diabetes (HR 0,79). In patients 
with diabetes, the effect was driven by the component hospitalization for HF. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 62/116 
 
 
 
 
 
The reduction of risk as documented by the primary composite endpoint was similar across subgroups based 
on baseline demographic and renal variables, including age, eGFR and UACR. However, patients in the lower 
eGFR categories (<30 vs ≥30 and < 45 vs ≥ 45) seem to have less effect, as the HR was higher in patients 
with lower eGFR. No further results have been provided in the different eGFR strata (1-5).  
Further analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints by eGFR strata show that the effect of dapagliflozin 
was consistent across all eGFR strata, including in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR 0.73 [95% 
CI 0.53 to 1.02]).  
Additional analyses on the components of the primary endpoint by baseline eGFR subgroup (< 30, ≥ 30, < 
45, and ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) show a numerical reductions of ESRD (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.50 to 1.04]) and 
its subcomponents (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and chronic dialysis) in patients with eGFR < 30 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Of note, the confidence intervals in the analyses of the group with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 are wider than those with ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2, while the upper confidence interval was greater than 1 
in all subgroups, adding uncertainty to the finding.  
Concerning secondary endpoints, reductions in all 3 secondary endpoints were observed in patients with 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: the renal endpoint (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.49 to 1.02]), CV death and 
hospitalisation for HF (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.53]), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.38 to 
1.21]). 
Patients in the lower systolic blood pressure category (<130 mmHg) had a higher reduction of the primary 
endpoint, vs those with higher SBP (>130 mmHg). It could be that patients with lower systolic blood 
pressure are subject to a more aggressive pharmacological treatment for their heart and kidney disease. The 
applicant has conducted additional analyses on background anti-hypertensive medication at baseline. Of 
note, several main categories of CKD and CV medications were less frequently used in the patients with 
lower SBP. Additional analyses on the primary endpoint shows that the effect of dapagliflozin was generally 
consistent across categories of baseline CKD or CV medication. 
The reduction of the secondary endpoint CV death and hospitalization for HF was similar across demographic 
and baseline renal parameters. Of note, female patients had a significant reduction of the HR as compared 
to male. Furthermore, the effect seems to be more pronounced in patients with eGFR ≥45 than those with 
eGFR <45, even though the interaction was not significant.  
The Applicant has provided further analyses of the secondary composite endpoint of CV death and 
hospitalisation for HF by baseline eGFR strata. The Applicant has also provided data on other secondary 
composite endpoints by eGFR strata. Even though no firm conclusion can be drawn from smaller subgroup 
analyses due to the low number of events, a numerical benefit in favour of dapagliflozin can be seen in all 
subgroups. These indicates a consistent efficacy across all eGFR levels and provides no indication of a trend 
towards reduced efficacy with decreased renal function. 
The reduction in death from any cause was similar across demographic and baseline renal parameters. 
4.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A positive treatment effect of dapagliflozin on the primary composite endpoint (≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESRD 
and renal or CV death) was shown, irrespective of diabetes status at baseline. The effect was mainly driven 
by the two renal components, ≥ 50% eGFR decline and ESRD. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for the 
reduction of the renal and CV secondary endpoints as well as all-cause mortality. The effects of dapagliflozin 
on the primary and secondary endpoints were generally consistent across the analysed subgroups, including 
diabetes status, eGFR and UACR level at baseline.

Of note, roughly 200 patients with diabetes in each treatment group were not judged to have diabetic 
nephropathy as the main cause of their kidney disease. Treatment effect of dapagliflozin seems to be 
consistent between the CKD aetiology categories diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy for the primary 
endpoint and all secondary endpoints and no sign of negative effect of dapagliflozin has been reported in the 
non-diabetic nephropathy population.  
Further to this, only patients with overt albuminuria levels ≥ 200 mg/g have been included in the study.  
Treatment with dapagliflozin may provide a potential benefit for patients with CKD that has not yet 
developed albuminuria, but clinical data in this patient group is scarce. From a mechanistic point of view, it 
seems reasonable to believe that the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in the development and progression of CKD 
is not only dependent on the reduction of albuminuria. This is supported by additional analyses showing that 
a substantial non-albumin-mediated treatment effect can be seen in the subgroup of patients with 
nondiabetic etiologies of CKD. However, evidence is higher for those patients with high levels of albuminuria, 
which is reflected in the SmPC. 
A similar reduction of the primary composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin group was seen independent of the 
aetiology of kidney disease. However, other causes of CKD such as T1DM, inflammatory and immunological 
conditions were excluded from the study. Additional analyses of the primary endpoint by CKD aetiology 
shows a consistent treatment benefits across all included aetiologies, including chronic glomerulonephritis.  
The fact that the pathophysiology of CKD in these aetiologies share the same mechanism, namely 
glomerular hyperfiltration, makes dapagliflozin a plausible drug candidate, even if data from the Dapa-CKD 
study concerning these aetiologies is very limited. The exclusion of patients with T1D is acknowledged and 
covered in SmPC section 4.4. 
The reduction of risk as documented by the primary composite endpoint was similar across subgroups based 
on baseline demographic and renal variables, including age, eGFR and UACR. However, patients in the lower 
eGFR categories (<30 vs >30 and < 45 vs > 45) seem to have less effect, as the HR was higher in patients 
with lower eGFR. Further analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints by eGFR strata show that the 
effect of dapagliflozin was consistent across all eGFR strata, including in patients with eGFR < 30 
mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Patients in the lower systolic blood pressure category (<130 mmHg) had a higher reduction of the primary 
endpoint vs those with higher SBP (>130 mmHg) but additional analyses on background of 
anti-hypertensive medication at baseline show that several main categories of CKD and CV medications were 
less frequently used in the patients with lower SBP. Additional analyses on the primary endpoint shows that 
the effect of dapagliflozin was generally consistent across categories of baseline CKD or CV medication. 
The reduction of the secondary endpoint CV death and hospitalization for HF was similar across demographic 
and baseline renal parameters but seems to be more pronounced in patients with eGFR >45 than those with 
eGFR <45, even though the interaction was not significant. Even though no firm conclusion can be drawn 
from smaller subgroup analyses due to the low number of events, a numerical benefit in favour of 
dapagliflozin can be seen in all subgroups. These indicates a consistent efficacy across all eGFR levels and 
provides no indication of a trend towards reduced efficacy with decreased renal function. 
Although the benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint composite CV death 
and hospitalisation for HF was generally consistent across subgroups based on demographic and baseline 
renal parameters (eGFR (< 30, ≥ 30, < 45, ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2)), due to limited experience, it is not 
recommended to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with GFR < 25 mL/min. This is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. If GFR falls below 45 mL/min, additional glucose lowering treatment should be 
considered in patients with diabetes mellitus if further glycaemic control is needed. This is also appropriately 
reflected in the SmPC.

4.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current safety evaluation is based on data from the completed DAPA-CKD study. 
The target population had CKD (eGFR ≥25 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2) with albuminuria (UACR ≥200 and 
≤5000 mg/g). The study population included both patients with T2DM and patients without diabetes, and 
patients were stratified based on T2DM status and UACR at baseline (UACR >1000 and ≤1000 mg/g). 
All summaries of AEs, safety laboratory data, and vital signs described below are presented for the 
on-treatment period, which includes AEs with an onset date on or after date of first dose and up to and 
including 30 days following last dose of study drug.  
Additional presentations include all events with onset on or after first dose of study drug regardless of 
whether patients were on study treatment or not at the time of the event, the on- and off-treatment period. 
With regard to AEs of special interest, on- and off- treatment (labelled simply as “SAS”) is considered the 
primary analysis approach for fractures and amputations, whereas the on-treatment period (labelled as 
“on-treatment (SAS)”) is the primary analysis approach for other AEs of special interest. 
Patient exposure 
The DAPA-CKD SAS included 4,298 patients, 2,149 on dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2,149 on placebo. About 70% 
of the study population were subjects with T2DM (1,453 and 1,450 subjects for dapagliflozin and placebo, 
respectively).  
Duration of exposure 
The duration of exposure to study drug ranged from 0 to 39.0 months. In total, there were 4,448 
patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin in the study. The median duration of exposure to study drug was 
balanced between treatment groups: 27.3 months in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 27.0 months in 
the placebo group.

Study drug dose reduction 
In specific cases, where a clinically relevant event of volume depletion, hypotension, and/or unexpected 
worsening of kidney function was seen, and when these could not be resolved by reducing the dose of, or 
stopping concomitant, non-essential medications, reduction of dapagliflozin to 5 mg or matching placebo 
was allowed by the protocol. 
There were 90 (4.2%) patients with dose reductions in the dapagliflozin group and 61 (2.8%) in the placebo 
group. Of these patients, 67 (3.1%) in the dapagliflozin group and 48 (2.2%) in the placebo group did not 
return to the 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin or matching placebo.  
The most frequent reason for dose reduction was AE: 48 (2.2%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group and 35 (1.6%) patients in the placebo group; SAEs that led to dose reduction were observed in 4 
(0.2%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 3 (0.1%) patients in the placebo group. The most 
common AEs that led to dose reduction of study drug were chronic kidney disease and hypovolaemia in the 
dapagliflozin group (5 [0.2%]) patients for both PTs), and renal impairment (9 [0.4%] patients) in the 
placebo group. 
Study drug interruption 
There were 378 (17.6%) patients with dose interruptions in the dapagliflozin group and 380 (17.7%) in the 
placebo group. Most patients had only 1 period of interruption. The median number of days per interruption 
was 14 days in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 9 days in the placebo group. The most common reason 
for interruption of study drug was AE, reported for 265 (12.3%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
and 269 (12.5%) patients in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AE, by PT, that led to 
interruption of study drug was urinary tract infection for dapagliflozin with 15 (0.7%) patients reporting this 
term (compared to 8 [0.4%] in the placebo group), and acute kidney injury for placebo with 18 (0.8%) 
patients reporting this term (compared to 14 [0.7%] in the dapagliflozin group). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
DAPA-CKD included patients with CKD (with an eGFR of ≥ 25 and ≤ 75mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR ≥ 200 and 
≤ 5000mg/g), either with T2DM or without diabetes, receiving dapagliflozin or placebo on top of standard of 
care.  
Adverse events 
The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin were evaluated based on SAEs, DAEs, changes in clinical 
chemistry/haematology parameters, and AEs of special interest. AEs were only to be recorded if they 
qualified as SAEs, or if the AE was the reason for permanent discontinuation from IP, IP interruption, or dose 
reduction, or if the AE qualified as an AE of special interest, or if a potential endpoint fulfilled the AE criteria. 
A summary of AEs in any category is presented in Table 15.

Deaths 
During the on-treatment period, 67 (3.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 85 (4.0%) in the placebo 
group died.  
During the on- and off-treatment period, 106 (4.9%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 159 (7.4%) in 
the placebo group died. In both treatment groups, most deaths occurred in the SOC of cardiac disorders. The 
most commonly reported AEs with an outcome of death by PT were death, acute myocardial infarction, 
myocardial infarction, and septic shock in the dapagliflozin group and death, acute myocardial infarction, 
pneumonia, and septic shock in the placebo group.   
Serious adverse events 
On treatment, there were fewer patients with SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment group than in the placebo 
group: 594 (27.6%) patients and 674 (31.4%) patients, respectively. The 3 most commonly reported SAEs 
by PT were: acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and cardiac failure in the dapagliflozin group and pneumonia, 
cardiac failure, and acute kidney injury in the placebo group (Table 16).

Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of symptoms of volume depletion 
On treatment, there were 120 (5.6%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 84 (3.9%) in the placebo group 
with any AE of symptoms of volume depletion, corresponding to event rates of 2.68 and 1.91 events per 100 
patient-years, respectively (Table 17). Serious AEs of symptoms of volume depletion were reported at a 
similar rate in the dapagliflozin treatment group and the placebo group: 16 (0.7%) and 15 (0.7%) patients, 
respectively. Few patients discontinued study drug due to AEs of symptoms of volume depletion; 4 (0.2%) 
in the dapagliflozin group and 1 (0.0%) in the placebo group. 
The most commonly reported AEs of symptoms of volume depletion, by PT, were hypotension reported by 47 
(2.2%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and by 28 (1.3%) in the placebo group, followed by hypovolaemia 
with 37 (1.7%) in the dapagliflozin group and 21 (1.0%) in the placebo group. All other events were reported 
by less than 1.0% of patients in any treatment group (Table 18). Most reported events were mild in 
intensity; 7 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6 in the placebo group had an event of severe intensity.

Renal adverse events 
On treatment, there were 144 (6.7%) patients with any renal AE in the dapagliflozin group and 169 (7.9%) 
in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 3.21 and 3.85 events per 100 patient-years, 
respectively (Table 19).  
There were 54 (2.5%) patients with renal SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared with 69 
(3.2%) in the placebo group. The number of patients with renal DAEs was low: 16 (0.7%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 20 (0.9%) in the placebo group. In the dapagliflozin treatment group, 37 patients 
reported events of severe intensity compared to 47 patients in the placebo group.

On treatment, 22 (1.0%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 20 (0.9%) patients in the 
placebo treatment group had a potential DKA event that was sent for central independent adjudication. Two 
patients in the placebo treatment group had events adjudicated as definite or probable DKA compared to 
none in the dapagliflozin group. Both events were adjudicated as definite (i.e., none-probable) and neither 
of them had a fatal outcome. No event of DKA was reported for patients without diabetes.

Fractures 
AEs of fracture were analysed primarily for the on- and off-treatment period (from first day of treatment until 
last visit). 
There were 85 (4.0%) patients with any AE of fracture in the dapagliflozin treatment group as compared to 
69 (3.2%) in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 1.75 and 1.43 events per 100 patient-years, 
respectively (Table 22.)

The identified subjects with events indicative of osteoporosis are presented by PT and treatment group in 
Table 25. Among the 154 patients with at least one fracture during the study (85 [4.0%) in the dapagliflozin 
group and 69 [3.2%] in the placebo group), osteoporosis was reported in the medical history at the start of 
the study for 7 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 9 patients in the placebo group. Of these, 2 patients 
in the dapagliflozin group and 5 in the placebo group reported fractures at sites commonly associated with 
osteoporosis.

High-energy and Low-energy Fractures 
In total, there were 98 fractures reported in the dapagliflozin group (51 AEs and 47 SAEs) and 76 reported 
in the placebo group (43 AES and 33 SAEs). In the dapagliflozin group, 43 (44%) had information on energy 
level with 16 (16%) due to high-energy trauma and 27 (28%) due to low-energy trauma. In the placebo 
group, 26 (34%) had information on energy level with 9 (12%) due to high-energy trauma and 17 (22%) 
due to low-energy trauma. For the remaining fractures, information on trauma is either unavailable or 
unclear.  
Among patients with fractures at sites commonly associated with osteoporosis, information indicating 
low-energy trauma was reported for 13 fractures in the dapagliflozin group (5 femur, 2 radius, 2 spinal, 2 
femoral neck, 1 hip, 1 spinal compression) and for 10 fractures in the placebo group (4 femur, 2 femoral 
neck, 1 hip, 1 wrist, 1 radius, 1 spinal). High-energy trauma was reported for 3 fractures in the dapagliflozin 
group: motorcycle accident (spinal fracture); traffic accident (spinal compression fracture); and falling down 
stairs (femur fracture), and for 2 fractures in the placebo group: fall on stairs (hip fracture) and road trauma 
(femoral neck fracture). 
Fractures related to volume depletion 
Volume depletion events could also potentially increase the risk of falls, and thereby fractures. The 
possibility that events of volume depletion led to a secondary increase in the risk of fractures was evaluated 
by investigating whether patients with a fracture had any reported symptoms of volume depletion within 3 
days prior to, or on, the day of onset of the fracture. No such pattern was seen. There were only 2 such 
patients, both in the dapagliflozin group: 1 with reported hypotension and 1 with reported hypovolaemia, in 
both cases on the same day as the onset of the fracture. The patient with hypovolaemia had stopped 
treatment with dapagliflozin on the day before the event (this was the patient’s own decision, after 863 days 
on IP).  
Amputations 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 78/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AEs of amputations were analysed primarily for the on- and off-treatment period (from first day of treatment 
until last visit). 
The number of patients who underwent at least 1 amputation (excluding trauma) was similar in both 
treatment groups; 35 (1.6%) and 39 (1.8%) patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, 
corresponding to event rates of 0.72 and 0.81 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. More than 1 
amputation was reported by 12 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 11 patients in the placebo group, of 
which 1 and 3 patients reported >3 amputations in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively (Table 
26). Only one patient without diabetes (in the placebo group) reported a non-traumatic amputation. 
There were numerically fewer patients with major amputations (below knee and above knee) in the 
dapagliflozin group (13 patients) than in the placebo group (20 patients).  
The great majority of amputations were surgical amputations, and traumatic and non-surgical amputations 
were only reported by isolated patients. Most patients with surgical amputations had 1 amputation; all apart 
from one were lower limb amputations.

The most common condition that triggered amputation was infection, occurring in 30 (1.4%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group and 32 (1.5%) in the placebo treatment group. Neuropathy was the most 
commonly reported contributing factor (0.6% of patients in both treatment groups).  
The incidence of amputations for dapagliflozin and placebo was 1.8% vs 2.3% in subjects ≤65 years and 
1.4% vs 1.1% for subjects >65 years. The incidence of amputations for dapagliflozin and placebo was 1.0% 
vs 1.2% in subjects with baseline eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2; 1.3% vs 1.2% in subjects with eGFR <45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2.0% vs 2.7% in subjects with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (source: Table 14.3.11.5). 
Events Leading to a Risk for Lower Limb Amputation (“Preceding Events”) 
AEs of “preceding events”, based on a pre-specified list of terms defined by the EMA PRAC, were analysed for 
the on- and off-treatment period (from first day of treatment until last visit). 
The number of patients with “preceding events” was 220 (10.2%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group and 200 (9.3%) patients in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 4.53 and 4.15 patients 
with events per 100 patient-years, respectively (Table 27, Table 28). Of these patients, 18 in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group, and 23 in the placebo group had subsequent amputations. 
The proportion of patients with preceding events in the subgroup of patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
was consistent with the overall population (Table 29). In this subgroup, no patient in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group and 2 patients in the placebo group had subsequent amputations.

Additional Safety Analyses 
Fournier’s Gangrene 
A total of 6 cases (3 from each treatment group) indicating potential Fournier’s gangrene were identified for 
blinded medical assessment by the Sponsor (Table 30). One of these events was assessed as Fournier’s 
gangrene (an event reported as anal abscess in the placebo group). 
Table 30 AE's indicating genital area infections or necrotizing fasciitis (SAS) 
Genital infections 
During the on-treatment period, SAEs and DAEs of genital infections were rare. Only 3 patients had an SAE 
of genital infection, all in the dapagliflozin group. The reported events were balanoposthitis, urogenital 
infection bacterial, and vulval cellulitis. Three patients, also in the dapagliflozin treatment group, had a DAE 
of genital infection. 
Urinary tract infections 
SAEs of UTI were more frequent in the dapagliflozin group (29 [1.3%]) compared with the placebo group (18 
[0.8%]). By far the most frequently reported SAE by PT was urinary tract infection in both treatment groups, 
with 20 (0.9%) patients reporting this PT in the dapagliflozin group and 13 (0.6%) in the placebo group 
(Table 31). DAEs of UTI were reported for 8 (0.4%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 3 (0.1%) 
patients in the placebo group. The PT urinary tract infection was also the single most reported DAE in both 
treatment groups with 7 (0.3%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 3 (0.1%) patients in the placebo 
group (Table 32).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
An increase in haemoglobin was observed in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo (mean change 
from baseline to last treatment value was 3.9 g/L in the dapagliflozin group and -3.2 g/L in the placebo 
group).

Clinical Chemistry 
Creatinine/ eGFR 
There was an initial increase in mean serum creatinine, which was more pronounced in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group than in the placebo group. However, the difference disappeared over the course of the 
study and from 12 months and throughout the remainder of the study, the mean change from baseline was 
larger in the placebo group. 
In line with the findings for serum creatinine, there was an initial decrease in mean eGFR which was small 
but more pronounced in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group; however the difference between 
treatment groups changed over time and at 16 months and up to 32 months the decrease was larger in the 
placebo group. 
Table 34 Haematology and clinical chemistry laboratory variables over time in SI units - on treatment 
(SAS) 
Marked laboratory abnormalities 
There were more patients with a marked abnormality of increased haematocrit in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group than in the placebo group. 
There were fewer patients with marked abnormalities of ALP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin and creatinine 
increase in the dapagliflozin treatment group. There were also fewer patients with marked abnormalities of 
hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, and hypernatremia in the dapagliflozin treatment group. With regard to 
hyperkalaemia, 206 (9.6%) of the patients in the dapagliflozin group and 229 (10.7%) of the patients in the 
placebo group had at least one measurement of serum-potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L on treatment.

Vital Signs and Body Weight 
Body weight 
There was a decrease in body weight in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared to the placebo 
treatment group (mean change from baseline to month 36 was -1.9 kg in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
and -1.0 kg in the placebo group).

Blood pressure 
Systolic BP decreased in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared with the placebo group over time: 
mean change from baseline to Month 36 was -2.2 mmHg in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 3.3 mmHg 
in the placebo group. There were no clinically relevant changes in diastolic BP or pulse rate in either 
treatment group.

Safety in special populations 
Effect of T2DM 
T2DM at baseline was defined as a history of T2DM, or HbA1c ≥6.5% at both Visit 1 and Visit 2.  
At baseline, of the 4,298 patients in the SAS, 2,903 (67.5%) patients had T2DM and 1,395 (32.5%) patients 
did not have diabetes. The effect of diabetes at baseline was analysed for all AE categories and for AEs of 
special interest (Table 37). 
Among patients with and without T2Dm, the number of patients reporting SAEs or DAEs of UTIs (Table 38, 
Table 39, Table 40, Table 41) and genital infections (Table 42, Table 43) below. SAEs and DAEs of genital 
infections were not reported for any patients without diabetes.

Effect by Renal Function 
The effect of renal function at baseline was analysed for all AE categories and for AEs of special interest 
(Table 44, 
Table 45 and Table 46). At baseline, of the 4,298 patients in the SAS, 1780 (41.4%) had an eGFR ≥45 
mL/min/1.73 m2,, 2,518 (58.6%) had an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 624 (14.5%) had an eGFR <30

For renal AEs, the difference between treatment groups was 3 patients: 42 patients (14.3%) in the 
dapagliflozin group compared with 39 patients (11.8%) in the placebo group. Renal SAEs were few and had 
a similar distribution as the non-serious AEs with 19 patients (6.5%) in the dapagliflozin group and 17 
patients (5.1%) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported PT was renal impairment with 22 (7.5%) 
patients in the dapagliflozin group and 18 (5.4%) in the placebo group (Table 46). A similar number of 
patients reported the PT of acute kidney injury in both treatment groups: 16 (5.5%) in the dapagliflozin 
group and 18 (5.4%) in the placebo group.

Effect by sex 
Of the 4,298 patients in the SAS, 66.8% were male and 33.2% were female. Subgroup analysis by sex was 
performed for amputations and fractures.  
The number of patients with amputations in the subgroup analysis by sex was generally consistent between 
treatment groups (1.7% vs 2.1% for DAPA vs placebo in males and 1.4% vs 1.3% for DAPA vs placebo in 
females).  
The number of patients with fractures in the subgroup analysis by sex was also generally consistent between 
treatment groups and the small difference seen between treatments in the overall population (3.3% vs 2.4% 
for DAPA vs placebo in males and 5.2% vs 4.7% for DAPA vs placebo in females). 
Effect by Baseline Blood Pressure 
Subgroup analysis by systolic blood pressure at baseline (≤ 130, >130 mmHg) was performed for AEs of 
symptoms of volume depletion. In the subgroup of patients with a systolic blood pressure of < 130 mmHg, 
the proportion of patients reporting any AEs in both treatment groups was higher (7.3% vs 4.4% for DAPA 
vs placebo) compared to the subgroup with a higher baseline systolic blood pressure (4.6% vs 3.6% for 
DAPA vs placebo). The number of patients reporting SAEs were similar between treatments in both 
subgroups. The overall pattern in both subgroups was consistent with the overall results. 
Extrinsic Factors 
No extrinsic factors were analysed in the DAPA-CKD study.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between dapagliflozin and other drugs or food were addressed in the original dapagliflozin T2DM 
clinical programme. For a summary, refer to the dapagliflozin product label. No new information is available 
on the potential impact on safety of such interactions in patients with CKD. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The treatment discontinuation rate was similar between treatment groups throughout the study. Overall, the 
numbers of DAEs were 118 (5.5%) patients and 123 (5.7%) patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo 
treatment groups, respectively (Table 48). The most commonly reported AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug were chronic kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and renal 
impairment in the dapagliflozin treatment group and renal impairment, glomerular filtration rate decreased, 
and end-stage renal disease in the placebo group.

Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant patients were excluded from participating in the DAPA-CKD study. 
In total 8 pregnancies were reported during the study, 2 in the dapagliflozin group and 6 in the placebo 
group. Of the 2 pregnancies in the dapagliflozin group, 1 was an anembryonic pregnancy (reported as an 
SAE, and 1 was terminated through elective abortion. Of the 6 pregnancies reported in the placebo group, 2 
ended in spontaneous abortion (reported as SAEs, and 1 was terminated through elective abortion. The birth 
of 1 healthy baby and the birth of 1 baby with congenital abnormalities have been reported through the 
sponsor’s safety database. The outcome of 1 pregnancy is unknown.  
Overdose 
No events of overdose of study drug were reported during the DAPA-CKD study. 
Drug abuse 
The potential for drug abuse for dapagliflozin has not been studied.  
Withdrawal and rebound 
The effect of dapagliflozin withdrawal and rebound has not been studied.  
Post marketing experience 
Dapagliflozin was first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in Australia on 05 October 2012 and it 
is currently approved in over 100 countries.  
Post-marketing experience in the approved indications is summarised in regular PBRERs that are submitted 
to regulatory authorities worldwide. The dapagliflozin PBRER with data lock 04 April 2020 included more 
than 9.5 million patient-years of post-marketing exposure (cumulative until 31 March 2020) and is dated 25 
May 2020. At the data lock of the dapagliflozin PBRER (04 April 2020), there was no new information to alter 
the overall positive benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin in the approved indications. 
4.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The established safety profile of dapagliflozin is based on the original dapagliflozin (submission for treatment 
of T2DM). The evaluation of the DAPA-CKD study provides information on the safety profile of dapagliflozin 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 98/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in subjects with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥25 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2) with albuminuria (UACR ≥200 
and ≤5000 mg/g). The study population included patients with T2DM (70%) and without diabetes (30%). 
In the study DAPA-CKD, 2,149 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 4,448 PY, 
regardless of interruptions (i.e. ‘on and off’ treatment), with 1,865 subjects (87%) for at least 52 weeks, 
1,773 subjects (82%) for at least 1,5 years and 1423 subjects (66%) for at least 2 years. The mean and 
median duration of exposure was 24.8 and 27.3 months for dapagliflozin and 24.3 and 27.0 months for 
placebo. The median duration of follow-up was 27.1 months for dapagliflozin. 
Data collection in this study focused on serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation (DAEs) and AEs of special 
interest.  
The number of SAEs was higher in the placebo group (31%) than dapagliflozin group (28%). The most 
frequently reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were acute kidney injury (1.7% vs 2.0%), pneumonia 
(1.7% vs 2.7%), cardiac failure (1.6% vs 2.2%) and acute myocardial infarction (1.3% vs 1.8%). There 
were more fatal cases in the placebo group compared with the dapagliflozin group (3.1% vs 4.0% 
on-treatment; 4.9% vs 7.4% on- and off-treatment for dapagliflozin vs placebo). 
Discontinuation rates due to AE were similar across the treatment groups in DAPA-CKD (6%). The most 
frequently reported AEs leading to study drug discontinuation for dapagliflozin was chronic kidney disease 
(0.5% vs 0.3%), GFR decreased (0.4% vs 0.5%) and renal impairment (0.4% vs 0.6%) for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo. 
Urinary tract infections 
The incidence of SAEs of UTIs was increased for dapagliflozin versus placebo (1.3% vs 0.8%), of which 
urinary tract infection was the most frequently reported PT for both dapagliflozin and placebo. There were 6 
reports of pyelonephritis and 1 report of pyonephrosis for dapagliflozin and 3 reports of pyelonephritis for 
placebo. DAEs of UTIs were reported with an incidence of 0.4% for dapagliflozin and 0.1% for placebo. The 
majority of subjects (79%) reporting SAEs of UTIs were in the subgroup with T2DM.   
Genital infections 
Three SAEs of genital infections (1 balanoposthitis, 1 urogenital infection bacterial and 1 vulval cellulitis) in 
subjects with T2DM were reported, all in the dapagliflozin group. Three patients (0.1%), all in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group, reported DAEs of genital infection. 
Volume depletion 
The incidence of adverse events suggestive of volume depletion was higher for dapagliflozin (5.6%) 
compared with placebo (3.9%). The incidence of serious AEs of volume depletion was 0.7% for dapagliflozin 
and placebo, respectively. 
The results were consistent in the subgroup analyses. Events of volume depletion was reported more 
frequently with dapagliflozin than with placebo in subjects with T2DM (5.9% vs 4.5%) and without T2DM 
(4.9% vs 2.7%) and in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.7% vs 3.9%) and eGFR ≥45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.3% vs 3.9%). However, in the subgroup with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence 
of volume depletion was similar for dapagliflozin (4.4%) and placebo (4.2%).  
Renal events  
Renal events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (7.9%) than in the dapagliflozin group (6.7%) 
in the overall population and for subjects with T2DM (7.8% vs 9.0% for DAPA vs placebo) and without T2DM 
(4.5% vs 5.4% for DAPA vs placebo). SAEs of renal events overall were also higher in the placebo (3.2%) 
relative the dapagliflozin group (2.5%). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 99/116 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of renal events 
was higher for placebo than for dapagliflozin. However, in subjects with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, renal 
events occurred more frequently for dapagliflozin compared to placebo, including serious renal events.  
In the DAPA-CKD study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin group and the placebo group. 
The initial (day 14) decrease in mean eGFR was -4.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dapagliflozin group 
and -0.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. At 28 months, change from baseline in eGFR 
was -7.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dapagliflozin group and -8.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. 
Fractures 
Fractures were reported for 4.0% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 3.2% in the placebo group, 
corresponding to an event rate of 1.75 and 1.43 events per 100 patient-years. The Kaplan-Meier plot 
indicates a slightly increase in fractures with dapagliflozin after about 20 months of treatment. The incidence 
of osteoporotic fractures was balanced between the groups (1.2% vs 1.1%) and location of the fractures 
varied with no specific pattern. Among subjects with osteoporotic fractures in the dapagliflozin group, low 
trauma fractures were reported in 50%, high trauma in 12% and unclear whether high or low in 38% of the 
fractures. In the placebo group, 43% high trauma, 9% low trauma and 48% unknown/unclear fractures 
were reported. 
The increase in fractures could be caused by an increased number of falls related to dapagliflozin-induced 
symptoms of volume depletion (e.g. dizziness/ hypotension); however, only 2 patients reported AE of 
symptoms of volume depletion prior the event of the fracture in the dapagliflozin group. A higher incidence 
of fractures in both treatment groups was observed in subjects ≥65 years of age and in females, 
respectively. Moreover, the incidence of fractures for dapagliflozin vs placebo was increased in subjects with 
T2DM (4.5% vs 3.5%) and in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (4.7% vs 3.4%); although, in 
subjects with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 the incidence of fractures was higher in the placebo group (4.5%) 
compared with the dapagliflozin group (3.8%). The incidence of fracture was balanced in subjects without 
T2DM (2.9% vs 2.6%), in subjects with eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73m2 (2.8% vs 2.9%) and in subjects ≥65 of 
age (4.5% vs 4.8%). In the risk group of post-menopausal women (>55 years), there were slightly more 
patients reporting fractures in the placebo group (6.1%) than the dapagliflozin group (5.7%). 
Amputations 
The incidence of subjects who underwent at least 1 surgical amputation was balanced (1.6% and 1.8%) and 
the event rate (0.72 vs 0.81 events per 100 PY) was balanced between dapagliflozin and placebo. All events 
of amputations were in the lower limbs, apart from one event in the upper limbs (in the placebo group). 
There were numerically more subjects in the placebo group (n=20; 51%) than in the dapagliflozin group 
(n=13; 36%) with major amputations (below knee and above knee). 
All patients with amputations, except one in the placebo group, were T2DM patients. The incidence of 
subjects suffering at least one amputation among subjects with T2DM was 2.4% and 2.6% for dapagliflozin 
and placebo, respectively. The incidence of amputations did not increase with decreased eGFR. 
The number of patients with an adverse event related to risk for lower amputation was 10% for dapagliflozin 
and 9.3% for placebo; of which diabetic foot related AEs was the most frequently reported preceding event 
followed by volume depletion and vascular AEs, such as peripheral ischaemia/ PAD. The number of subjects 
who underwent subsequent amputations was 8% (n=18) in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 12% 
(n=23) in the placebo group. The incidence of patients with preceding events in the subgroup of patients 
with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73m2 was similar to the overall population.

Diabetic ketoacidosis 
In total 2 subjects had an event adjudicated as a definite DKA, both in the placebo group. Both cases were 
reported for patients with T2DM and eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2, neither of them had a fatal outcome. 
Major hypoglycaemic events 
In the DAPA-CKD study only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. Subjects with major 
hypoglycaemic events were slightly more common in the placebo (1.3%; n=28) than in the dapagliflozin 
group (0.7%; n=14). Six cases (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and 14 (0.7%) in the placebo group were 
serious. All subjects with major hypoglycaemic events had T2DM at baseline and were using antidiabetic 
agents (sulfonylureas or insulin, or a combination) at the time of event, except for 3 subjects (1 subject in 
the dapagliflozin group and 3 subjects in the placebo group). 
Fournier’s gangrene 
In total 6 cases indicating genital area infections or necrotising fasciitis were identified; 3 (0.1%) in the 
dapagliflozin groups and 3 (0.1%) in the placebo group. One of these cases (in the placebo group) was 
assessed as Fournier’s gangrene. 
Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
During the study, an increase in mean haematocrit for dapagliflozin (5.1%) compared with placebo (-2.6%) 
was observed. Increased haematocrit is adequately labelled (frequency ‘common’) for dapagliflozin. 
The eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The change in eGFR was 
initially (within 2 weeks) and up to 16 weeks of treatment more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to 
placebo (-6.5% vs -1.7%); however, the decrease in eGFR was larger in the placebo from 16 weeks and 
onwards. 
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo;  
mean change from baseline up to 36 months of treatment was -1.9 kg (-2.3%) for dapagliflozin and -1.0 kg 
(-1.2%) for placebo. 
The decline in SBP and DBP from baseline in the dapagliflozin group was most pronounced early in the study, 
at Day 14 (-4.6 mmHg and -2.1 mmHg) and up to 2 months of treatment (-4.4 mmHg and -1.9 mmHg). 
Thereafter, SBP and DBP tended to increase, except for a slight decrease in SBP and DBP at month 24 and 
28. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In the DAPA-CKD study, 58% were ≤65 and 42% were >65 years of age. In total, 363 subjects were >75 
years of age, of which 177 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin. A slightly higher reporting rate was 
noted in subjects >65 years of age, as expected.  
In general, the safety profile for patients ≤ 65 and >65 years of age was in line with that for the overall 
population; however, renal events were slightly more frequently common for dapagliflozin (9.2%) than for 
placebo (8.1%) in subjects >65 years. The incidence of fractures was increased for dapagliflozin versus 
placebo in subjects ≤65 years (3.5% vs 2.0%) and was balanced in subjects >65 years of age (4.5% vs 
4.8%).  
Effect by sex 
The number of fractures was increased overall (4.0% vs 3.2%) and in the subgroup of males (3.3% vs 
2.4%) and females (5.2% vs 4.7%), respectively, for dapagliflozin compared with placebo

Effect by baseline blood pressure 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by systolic blood pressure at baseline (<130, ≥130 mmHg) was performed 
for AEs suggestive of volume depletion. The incidence of volume depletion was 7.3% vs 4.4% (SAEs: 0.8% 
vs 0.5%) in subjects <130 mmHg and 4.6% vs 3.6% (SAEs: 0.7% vs 0.8%) in subjects ≥130 mmHg for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Effect by renal function 
The incidence of any SAE was higher in the eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (31%), including  eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (35%), compared to the eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (28%); although, the 
incidence was higher in the placebo group vs the dapagliflozin group in all subgroups.  
In the overall population (4.0% vs 3.2%) and in subjects eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (4.7% vs 3.4%), the 
incidence of fractures was higher for dapagliflozin relative placebo; however, in the subgroup with eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 the incidence of fractures was higher in the placebo group (4.5%) than in the dapagliflozin 
group (3.8%). 
Renal events were more common in subjects with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with dapagliflozin 
(14.3%) than with placebo (11.8%), including serious renal events (6.5% vs 5.1%). The most frequently 
reported event was renal impairment (7.5% vs 5.4%).  
In the subgroup with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects with AEs leading to dose interruption (16.0% vs 
13.9%) and dose reductions (3.1% vs 0.9%) were higher in the dapagliflozin group versus the placebo 
group; however, AEs leading to discontinuation were slightly more frequent in placebo than in the 
dapagliflozin group (9.6% vs 10.9%). 
Initially there was a decrease in eGFR in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo group, across all 
subgroups. Over time, the eGFR declined more in the placebo group than in the dapagliflozin group. The 
pattern was similar across the eGFR subgroups (eGFR ≥45 vs <45 and eGFR ≥30 vs <30, respectively); 
however, the magnitude of the initial decrease in eGFR was more pronounced in the subgroups with higher 
baseline eGFR (≥45 and ≥30) compared with the subgroups with lower baseline eGFR (<45 and <30). The 
DAPA-CKD study did not include any follow-up of eGFR after discontinuation of treatment. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with a greater reduction in UACR for dapagliflozin compared 
with placebo across the subgroups; eGFR ≥45 vs <45 and eGFR ≥30 vs <30, respectively. The difference in 
UACR between dapagliflozin and placebo was maintained throughout the duration of the study. The 
frequency of ESRD was increased in the subgroups eGFR <45 (7.9% vs 10.5%) and eGFR <30 (16.7% vs 
21.8%) compared with the subgroups eGFR ≥45 (1.0% vs 3.3%) and eGFR ≥30 (3.2% vs 4.9%); however, 
the frequency of ESRD was higher in the placebo group compared with the dapagliflozin group across the 
subgroups. 
Effect of T2DM 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the T2DM subgroup (34%) compared with the non-diabetes subgroup 
(21%); however, the incidence was higher in the placebo group versus dapagliflozin in both subgroups.  
Overall, there was no substantial difference in safety profile for subjects with and without T2DM apart from 
that the incidence of fractures was increased for dapagliflozin compared to placebo in subjects with T2DM 
(4.5% vs 3.5%) and was more balanced in subjects with non-T2DM (2.9% vs 2.6%).

4.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The DAPA-CKD study provides information on the safety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects with chronic 
kidney disease (eGFR ≥25 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2) with albuminuria. 
In the overall population and in the additional subgroup analyses on baseline diabetes status and renal 
function, the number of fatal cases, including SAEs, was higher in the placebo group than in the dapagliflozin 
group.  
The safety profile for dapagliflozin in the DAPA-CKD study was overall similar compared with previously 
identified adverse drug reactions for dapagliflozin. However, the incidence of fractures was increased for 
dapagliflozin compared with placebo. The incidence of osteoporotic fractures was balanced between the 
groups (1.2% vs 1.1%) and location of the fractures varied with no specific pattern. 
Renal events, including serious renal events, were more common in the subgroup with eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with dapagliflozin compared with placebo. Moreover, adverse events leading to 
dose reductions and dose interruptions were increased for dapagliflozin compared with placebo for subjects 
with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2; however, AEs leading to discontinuation were slightly more frequent in 
placebo than in the dapagliflozin group. There is no experience to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in 
patients with eGFR <25 mL/min. Dapagliflozin is not recommended for initiation in patients with eGFR <25 
mL/min.

7.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
7.1.  Therapeutic Context 
7.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CKD is a serious and progressive condition that is associated with CV disease and increased risk of adverse 
outcomes including HF, premature death, ESRD, and the need for RRT. The most common causes of CKD are 
diabetes (42%), hypertension (18%), and glomerulonephritis of varying aetiologies (18%). An estimated 
700 million people worldwide live with CKD. The global prevalence of CKD stage 3 to 5 is estimated at 10.6% 
and estimates of global incidence, prevalence, and mortality of CKD have all increased dramatically since 
1990. 
7.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard of care for CKD in patients with and without diabetes is represented by blood pressure control and 
reduction of proteinuria through RAAS blockade (ACE-I or ARB) combined with CV risk management and/or 
and glycaemic control as necessary. 
However, interventional studies assessing the use of ACE-I or ARB for the treatment for DKD indicate that 
patients treated with these drugs remain at risk of morbidity, mortality, and progression to ESRD. An unmet 
need remains for safe and effective therapies that further reduce CKD morbidity, mortality, and progression 
towards ESRD, irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes or albuminuria. 
7.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
DAPA-CKD was an international, multicentre, event-driven, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo, given once daily in 
addition to standard of care, to prevent the progression of CKD and renal or CV death. 
The study population was defined as having CKD (eGFR ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with albuminuria 
[UACR] ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g), with or without T2DM, on stable and maximum-tolerated daily dose of 
ACE-I or ARB.  
The study was designed to test the hypothesis that dapagliflozin is superior to placebo for the prevention of 
progression of CKD and renal or CV death, as measured by the primary composite endpoint  of ≥ 50% 
sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD (sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic dialysis or renal 
transplant), and renal or CV death when added to current background therapy. The secondary endpoints 
were (1) the composite of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD, and renal death, (2) the composite of 
hospitalisation for HF and CV death, (3) all-cause mortality. The safety objective was to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of dapagliflozin in the target patient population. 
DAPA-CKD was an event-driven study. It was planned to observe 681 primary endpoint events in order to 
provide a statistical power of 90% for the primary endpoint, assuming a true HR of 0.78 and based on a 
one-sided alpha of 0.025. The DMC recommended to stop the trial early following a routine assessment of 
study data, based on positive efficacy results.  
In the study, 4304 patients were randomised at 386 study sites in 21 countries: 2152 in the placebo group 
and 2152 in the dapagliflozin group. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 107/116 
 
 
 
 
 
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. At baseline, 
67.5% of patients had T2DM. Mean eGFR was 43.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, median UACR was 949.3 mg/g, and 
mean systolic BP was 137.1 mmHg. In all, 14.5% of the study population had an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2. 
7.2.  Favourable effects 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint initiated reducing the incidence of the 
composite primary endpoint of ≥50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD, and renal or CV death (HR 0.61 
[95% CI 0.51, 0.72], p < 0.0001). All components contributed to the observed treatment effect. 
Demonstration sequential testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo for the reduction of the secondary endpoints renal composite endpoint 
without CV death (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.45, 0.68], p < 0.0001), the composite of CV death or hospitalisation 
for HF (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.55, 0.92]), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.53, 0.88]). The effects of 
dapagliflozin on the primary and secondary endpoints were generally consistent across the analysed 
subgroups, including diabetes status, eGFR and UACR level at baseline. 
Dapagliflozin also reduced exploratory variables related to progression to kidney failure, such as eGFR 
decline over time and time to ≥ 30 and ≥ 40% decline in eGFR. Additionally, dapagliflozin reduced the 
incidence of acute worsening in kidney function (evaluated by doubling of serum creatinine between visits) 
and reduced risk markers for progressive kidney failure, such as UACR and SBP during the study. 
7.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Statistical methods applied are in general acceptable. Given the compelling efficacy results, the decision for 
early stop seems reasonable, however, without any consideration of its impact on evaluability of the safety 
data and disregarded from the uncertainties around the informal statistical analyses. The explanation of the 
circumstances around the early stop showed that the decision to perform an early efficacy analysis was 
made based on unblinded descriptive analysis of the primary composite endpoint, which was not part of the 
safety review according to the DMC charter. The unplanned early stop has therefore implications on the 
interpretation of statistical significance of the primary and secondary endpoints, and the appropriate way of 
presentation of these endpoints in the SmPC. In this respect, p-values for the secondary endpoints 
“Composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure” and “All-cause mortality” are 
considered nominal due to the early stop. 
Roughly 200 patients with diabetes in each treatment group were not judged to have diabetic nephropathy 
as the main cause of their kidney disease. The Applicant has reviewed data for the primary and secondary 
endpoints in patients with T2D according to the adjudicated cause of their CKD aetiology. The fact that there 
were few events in the non-DKD group for the all endpoints limits the interpretation of the data. The 
treatment effect of dapagliflozin seems to be consistent between the CKD aetiology categories diabetic and 
non-diabetic nephropathy for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. 
Patients in the lower systolic blood pressure category (<130 mmHg) had a higher reduction of the primary 
endpoint, vs those with higher SBP (>130 mmHg). Of note, several main categories of CKD and CV 
medications were less frequently used in the patients with lower SBP. Additional analyses on the primary 
endpoint shows that the effect of dapagliflozin was generally consistent across categories of baseline CKD or 
CV medication. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
 
 
The reduction of the secondary endpoint CV death and hospitalization for HF was similar across demographic 
and baseline renal parameters but seems to be more pronounced in patients with eGFR >45 than those with 
eGFR <45, even though the interaction was not significant. Even though no firm conclusion can be drawn 
from smaller subgroup analyses due to the low number of events, a numerical benefit in favour of 
dapagliflozin can be seen in all subgroups. These indicates a consistent efficacy across all eGFR levels and 
provides no indication of a trend towards reduced efficacy with decreased renal function. 
Although the benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint composite CV death 
and hospitalisation for HF was generally consistent across subgroups based on demographic and baseline 
renal parameters (eGFR (< 30, ≥ 30, < 45, ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2)), due to limited experience, it is not 
recommended to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with GFR < 25 mL/min. This is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. If GFR falls below 45 mL/min, additional glucose lowering treatment should be 
considered in patients with diabetes mellitus if further glycaemic control is needed. This is also appropriately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
The new claimed indication concerns all patients with CKD, independent of the aetiology. Patients with active 
inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatments where excluded from the trial, so were patients with T1D 
and PKD. The fact that the pathophysiology of CKD in these aetiologies share the same mechanism, namely 
glomerular hyperfiltration, makes dapagliflozin a plausible drug candidate, even if data from the DAPA-CKD 
study concerning these aetiologies is very limited. The exclusion of patients with T1D is acknowledged and 
addressed in SmPC section 4.4. 
Only patients with albuminuria levels ≥200 mg/g have been included in the study, as a prognostic 
enrichment factor and not due to any expectation that dapagliflozin would have less efficacy in patients 
without albuminuria. As SLGT-2 mediated nephroprotection is not only based on the reduction of 
albuminuria levels, it seems plausible that patients without albuminuria might benefit from treatment with 
dapagliflozin (albeit likely to a less extent). There is no experience with dapagliflozin for the treatment of 
CKD in patients without T2DM who do not have albuminuria. As it is expected that the effect of dapagliflozin 
correlates to the degree of albuminuria and that patients with albuminuria may benefit more of the 
treatment, this is reflected in the SmPC. Treatment with dapagliflozin in the DAPA-CKD study was in 
conjunction with ARB/ACEi. This is also reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
7.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The evaluation of the DAPA-CKD study provides information on the safety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects 
with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥25 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2) with albuminuria. The study population 
included patients with T2DM (70%) and without diabetes (30%). 
In the study DAPA-CKD, 2,149 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 4,448 PY, 
regardless of interruptions (i.e. ‘on and off’ treatment), with 1,865 subjects (87%) for at least 52 weeks and 
1423 subjects (66%) for at least 2 years. The mean and median duration of exposure was 24.8 and 27.3 
months for dapagliflozin and 24.3 and 27.0 months for placebo. The median duration of follow-up was 27.1 
months for dapagliflozin. 
The number of fatal cases (3.1% vs 4.0%), including SAEs (28% vs 31%), was lower in the dapagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group.   
The incidence of SAEs of UTIs was increased for dapagliflozin versus placebo (1.3% vs 0.8%), of which the 
majority of subjects (79%) were in the subgroup with T2DM. 
Three SAEs of genital infections in subjects with T2DM were reported, all in the dapagliflozin group (0.1% vs 
0%).

Events of volume depletion was reported more frequently with dapagliflozin (5.6%) than with placebo 
(3.9%). The incidence of SAEs of volume depletion was 0.7% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively. 
Renal events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (7.9%) than in the dapagliflozin group (6.7%), 
including SAEs of renal events (3.2% and 2.5% for placebo and dapagliflozin). 
Fractures were reported for 4.0% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 3.2% in the placebo group, 
corresponding to an event rate of 1.75 and 1.43 events per 100 patient-years. The Kaplan-Meier plot 
indicates a slightly increase in fractures with dapagliflozin after about 20 months of treatment. The incidence 
of osteoporotic fractures was balanced between the groups (1.2% vs 1.1%) and location of the fractures 
varied with no specific pattern. Among subjects with osteoporotic fractures in the dapagliflozin group, low 
trauma fractures were reported in 50%, high trauma in 12% and unclear whether high or low in 38% of the 
fractures. In the placebo group, 43% high trauma, 9% low trauma and 48% unknown/unclear fractures 
were reported. 
The incidence of subjects who underwent at least 1 surgical amputation (1.6% and 1.8%) and the event rate 
(0.72 vs 0.81 events per 100 PY) was balanced between dapagliflozin and placebo. All events of amputations 
were in the lower limbs, apart from one event in the upper limbs (in the placebo group). There were 
numerically more subjects in the placebo group (n=20; 51%) than in the dapagliflozin group (n=13; 36%) 
with major amputations (below knee and above knee). All patients with amputations, except one in the 
placebo group, were T2DM patients.  
In total 2 subjects had an event adjudicated as a definite DKA, both in the placebo group. Both cases were 
reported for patients with T2DM and eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2, neither of them had a fatal outcome. 
Major hypoglycaemic events 
In the DAPA-CKD study only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. Subjects with major 
hypoglycaemic events were slightly more common in the placebo (1.3%; n=28) than in the dapagliflozin 
group (0.7%; n=14). Six cases (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and 14 (0.7%) in the placebo group were 
serious. All subjects with major hypoglycaemic events had T2DM at baseline and the majority were using 
antidiabetic agents (sulfonylureas or insulin, or a combination) at the time of event. 
Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
The eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The change in eGFR was 
initially (within 2 weeks) and up to 16 weeks of treatment more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to 
placebo (-6.5% vs -1.7%); however, the decrease in eGFR was larger in the placebo from 16 weeks and 
onwards. 
The decline in SBP and DBP from baseline in the dapagliflozin group was most pronounced early in the study, 
at Day 14 (-4.6 mmHg and -2.1 mmHg) and up to 2 months of treatment (-4.4 mmHg and -1.9 mmHg). 
Thereafter, SBP and DBP tended to increase, except for a slight decrease in SBP and DBP at month 24 and 
28. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In general, the safety profile for patients ≤ 65 and >65 years of age was in line with that for the overall 
population; however, renal events were slightly more frequently common for dapagliflozin (9.2%) than for 
placebo (8.1%) in subjects >65 years.  
The incidence of fractures was increased for dapagliflozin versus placebo in subjects ≤65 years (3.5% vs 
2.0%); however, balanced in subjects >65 years of age (4.5% vs 4.8%).

Effect by sex 
Subgroup analysis by sex was performed for amputations and fractures. The number of subjects with 
amputations was similar between males (1.7% vs 2.1%) and females (1.4% vs 1.3%) treated with 
dapagliflozin versus placebo and was in line with the overall population.  
Effect by baseline blood pressure 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by systolic blood pressure at baseline (<130, ≥130 mmHg) was performed 
for AEs suggestive of volume depletion. The incidence of volume depletion was 7.3% vs 4.4% (SAEs: 0.8% 
vs 0.5%) in subjects <130 mmHg and 4.6% vs 3.6% (SAEs: 0.7% vs 0.8%) in subjects ≥130 mmHg for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Effect by renal function 
The incidence of any SAE was higher in the eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (31%), including  eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (35%), compared to the eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (28%); although, the 
incidence was higher in the placebo group vs the dapagliflozin group in all subgroups.  
Renal events (14.3% vs 11.8%), including serious renal events (6.5% vs 5.1%) were more common in 
subjects with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with dapagliflozin than with placebo. The most frequently 
reported event was renal impairment (7.5% vs 5.4%).  
Initially there was a decrease in eGFR in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo group, across all 
subgroups. Over time, the eGFR declined more in the placebo group than in the dapagliflozin group. The 
pattern was similar across the eGFR subgroups (eGFR ≥45 vs <45 and eGFR ≥30 vs <30, respectively); 
however, the magnitude of the initial decrease in eGFR was more pronounced in the subgroups with higher 
baseline eGFR (≥45 and ≥30) compared with the subgroups with lower baseline eGFR (<45 and <30). The 
DAPA-CKD study did not include any follow-up of eGFR after discontinuation of treatment. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with a greater reduction in UACR for dapagliflozin compared 
with placebo across the subgroups; eGFR ≥45 vs <45 and eGFR ≥30 vs <30, respectively. The difference in 
UACR between dapagliflozin and placebo was maintained throughout the duration of the study. The 
frequency of ESRD was increased in the subgroups eGFR <45 (7.9% vs 10.5%) and eGFR <30 (16.7% vs 
21.8%) compared with the subgroups eGFR ≥45 (1.0% vs 3.3%) and eGFR ≥30 (3.2% vs 4.9%); however, 
the frequency of ESRD was higher in the placebo group compared with the dapagliflozin group across the 
subgroups. 
Effect of T2DM 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the T2DM subgroup (34%) compared with the non-diabetes subgroup 
(21%); however, the incidence was higher in the placebo group versus dapagliflozin in both subgroups.  
7.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The incidence of SAEs and renal events was higher in subjects with T2DM compared to subjects without 
T2DM; however, the safety profiles did not differ in the subgroups.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431093/2021 
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
 
 
The increase in fractures could be caused by an increased number of falls related to dapagliflozin-induced 
symptoms of volume depletion (e.g. dizziness/ hypotension); however, only 2 patients reported AE of 
symptoms of volume depletion prior to the fracture in the dapagliflozin group. It is not possible to draw any 
firm conclusions on the incidence of high vs low trauma fractures in the study since a substantial amount of 
the reports was lacking information on this point.  
The incidence of renal events, including SAEs renal events, was increased in subjects with eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with dapagliflozin compared with placebo. Moreover, adverse events leading to 
dose reductions and interruptions were increased for dapagliflozin compared with placebo. There is no 
experience in initiation of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with eGFR <25 mL/min. Dapagliflozin is 
not recommended for initiation in patients with eGFR <25 mL/min.

7.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
7.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CKD is a serious and progressive condition that is associated with CV disease and increased risk of adverse 
outcomes. The most common cause of CKD is diabetes. Despite widespread use of ARBs or ACEi, patients 
with CKD, including those with diabetes, remain at high risk of developing ESRD and/or experiencing CV 
events. Dapagliflozin, on top of an ARB or ACEi, resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
40% reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESRD and 
renal or CV death compared to placebo. Analyses of secondary renal (45% reduction of eGFR), CV composite 
(30% reduction) endpoints and all-cause mortality (30% reduction) also showed positive results. 
Although the benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint composite CV death 
and hospitalisation for HF was generally consistent across subgroups based on demographic and baseline 
renal parameters (eGFR (< 30, ≥ 30, < 45, ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2)), due to limited experience, it is not 
recommended to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with GFR < 25 mL/min. This is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. If GFR falls below 45 mL/min, additional glucose lowering treatment should be 
considered in patients with diabetes mellitus if further glycaemic control is needed. This is also appropriately 
reflected in the SmPC.

The results were similar in CKD patients with and without T2DM and across analysed subgroups, including 
parameters that reflect acute worsening in kidney function and progression of kidney failure. Of note, there 
was a trend towards less effect in patients within the lower eGFR categories, but the effect in these groups 
is still considered to be of clinical relevance. 
A similar reduction of the primary composite endpoint in the dapagliflozin group was seen in the different 
subgroups of CKD aetiologies included in the study. However, other aetiologies leading to CKD such as 
T1DM, PKD, inflammatory and immunological diseases were excluded from the study. The fact that the 
pathophysiology of CKD in these aetiologies share the same mechanism makes dapagliflozin a plausible drug 
candidate, even if data from the DAPA-CKD study concerning these aetiologies is very limited. The exclusion 
of patients with T1D is acknowledged with addition of text to SmPC section 4.4. 
Only patients with overt albuminuria levels > 200 mg/g have been included in the study. In a scientific 
advice, a lower inclusion limit of UACR 200 mg/g in the DAPA-CKD study was agreed as a prognostic 
enrichment strategy to select patients at higher risk of experiencing a disease related-endpoint event and 
not due to any expectation that dapagliflozin would have less efficacy in patients without albuminuria. The 
published literature elucidates the pathophysiological processes behind the development and progression of 
CKD and suggests other potential effects of SGLT2 inhibition, besides reduction of albuminuria. This 
supports the potential benefit of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD and without albuminuria. However, it is 
expected that the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is less pronounced in subjects without albuminuria. 
This is stated in the SmPC. 
No new safety concerns arise from the data provided compared to what is previously known concerning the 
safety profile for dapagliflozin. In the overall population and in the additional subgroup analyses based on 
baseline diabetes status and renal function, the number of SAEs was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group. The incidence of SAEs and renal events was higher in subjects with T2DM compared to 
subjects without T2DM; however, the safety profiles did not differ in the subgroups.  
There was no indication of worsening the safety profile with declining renal function, except for subjects with 
eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 where the incidence of renal events and AEs leading to dose reductions and dose 
interruptions were increased for dapagliflozin relative to placebo; however, AEs leading to discontinuation 
were slightly more frequent in placebo than in the dapagliflozin group.  
With regards to safety in the subgroup with eGFR 25-30 (n=624), the absolute number of events was low 
and therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Treatment in this subgroup was beneficial (HR 0.73; 
0.43-1.02).  
Therefore, the benefit risk balance in subjects with eGFR 25-30 is considered positive. There is no experience 
in initiation of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with eGFR <25 mL/min. Dapagliflozin is not 
recommended for initiation in patients with eGFR <25 mL/min. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, positive effects of dapagliflozin treatment in patients with CKD as represented by the study 
population of the DAPA-CKD study was documented. Although there is no clinical evidence generated by 
phase 3 clinical trials of dapagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients without albuminuria, based on the 
mechanism of action, a beneficial effect is also expected in this population.  
Since no new safety concerns arise from the data provided and as the known risks with dapagliflozin are 
considered manageable, the beneficial effects outweigh the risks in patients with CKD (with and without 
T2DM).

Summary of risk management plan for Vabomere 
(meropenem/vaborbactam) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vabomere. The RMP details important risks 
of Vabomere, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Vabomere’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Vabomere's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vabomere should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Vabomere should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vabomere’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Vabomere is authorised for treatment of the following infections in adults: 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
• 
Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
Vabomere is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to bacterial organisms in adult patients 
with limited treatment options (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains meropenem and 
vaborbactam as the active substances and it is given by intravenous administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Vabomere’s benefits can be found in Vabomere’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=/pages/medicines/human/medicines/004669/human_
med_002325.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Vabomere, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Vabomere's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vabomere is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Vabomere are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vabomere. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

Serious hypersensitivity 
Important identified risk  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
In Vabomere Phase III studies, one patient experienced a life-
the medicine 
threatening infusion-related reaction. No other events of serious 
hypersensitivity were reported. Although there have not been a 
lot of hypersensitivity cases with Vabomere, antibiotic 
treatments are often associated with hypersensitivity reactions. 
Most emergency department visits for antibiotic-associated 
adverse events were for allergic reactions [Shehab et al, 2008]. 
People who are allergic to penicillin may also experience an 
allergic reaction to Vabomere because they are similar in 
chemical structure. Hypersensitivity reactions causing rash, 
itching, and/or hives are the most common and occur in up to 
8% of patients who are treated with a penicillin-type antibiotic 
and up to 3% of patients who receive a cephalosporin-type 
antibiotic. Anaphylaxis, a more serious type of hypersensitivity 
reaction, develops in only 0.004% to 0.015% of patients, and 
death due to this anaphylaxis occurs only in 0.001% to 0.003% 
of penicillin treatment courses. 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with known hypersensitivity to carbapenems including 
meropenem or to other beta-lactams may be at risk of serious 
hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity reactions can lead to skin 
rashes, itching, and, in rare instances, can be serious and life-
threatening with need for medical intervention and possible 
hospitalisation or could potentially cause death.

Risk minimisation measures 
In Vabomere Phase III studies, one patient experienced a 
non-serious Clostridium difficile colitis after treatment with 
Vabomere. CDAD is a leading cause of diarrhoea from 
exposure to bacteria in a hospital. It is a major concern in 
hospitalized patients. Vabomere will be used to treat 
hospitalized patients with complicated infections, so the risk 
of developing CDAD may be higher in these patients. 
Risk factors include a history of C. difficile infection, use of 
antibiotics in the previous 4 weeks, use of gastric acid 
suppressors, recent hospitalisation or residence in nursing 
care, and advanced age are potential risk factors for CDAD 
[Cioni et al, 2016]. Fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and third 
generation cephalosporins have commonly been identified as 
high-risk antibiotics for the development of CDAD. Treatment 
with carbapenems (the class of antibiotics that includes 
meropenem) has also been identified as a risk for developing 
CDAD [Buckler et al, 2014].

Risk minimisation measures 
Beta-lactam antibiotics are known to be associated with 
seizures. Carbapenem antibiotics (the class of antibiotics that 
includes meropenem) have been associated with a risk of 
neurotoxicity, such as seizures [Pestotnik et al, 1993]. 
Meropenem-associated seizures have also been observed 
with an incidence of 0.08% [Norrby et al, 1999]. 
Seizures were observed with meropenem mostly in patients 
with central nervous system (CNS) disorders, bacterial 
meningitis and/or kidney damage. Risk factors for 
carbapenem-associated seizure includes underlying CNS 
disease, history of seizures, kidney damage, and use of high 
doses of carbapenem antibiotics [Pestotnik et al, 1993]. 
Drugs given at the same time as Vabomere that are known to 
increase the risk of seizures may also increase this risk 
(metronidazole, quinolones, and theophylline). The risk of 
seizures is also increased in patients treated with the 
anticonvulsant valproic acid/sodium valproate or valpromide 
and meropenem at the same time as Vabomere due to an 
interaction causing a lower blood concentration of the 
anticonvulsant.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Hepatotoxicity, or liver toxicity, has been reported in patients 
treated with beta-lactams. Carbapenems have been 
associated with mild brief liver enzymes elevations. Issues 
with the bile duct have also been seen [LiverTox: 
Carbapenems; Serranti et al, 2013].  
Safety analyses of patients who were treated with 
meropenem among other antibiotics for serious bacterial 
infection in clinical trials showed a drug-induced elevation in 
liver enzymes caused by meropenem and other similar drugs. 
However, the rate was low (below 5% of patients), and the 
elevations were generally not considered clinically significant. 
Other analyses showed lower rates of abnormal bile duct 
function tests (1.5% of patients or lower) [Linden, 2007, 
Norrby et al, 1999]. 
Repetitive administration, female gender, advanced age 
especially for bile duct disorders, and large total dose have 
been suggested as risk factors [Quattropani et al, 2001]. 
Parenteral nutrition and sepsis have also been considered 
[LiverTox: Carbapenems].

Table 6: 
Development of resistance to Vabomere 
Important potential risk 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Development of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics can occur 
with all antibiotics. It is a serious threat to public health 
globally because there are few options for treatment of 
serious infections. It is possible for bacteria to become 
resistant to Vabomere during treatment of a given patient or 
to develop resistance overtime after transmission in a 
community.  
Using a Vabomere dose below the recommended dose or not 
giving Vabomere to a patient for a long enough time could 
increase the risk for development of resistance during 
Vabomere therapy.  
 
 
 
In the healthcare setting, risk factors that may increase 
development of antimicrobial resistance are: 
Poor hand hygiene of healthcare providers,  
• 
•  Greater severity of illness of hospitalized patients,  
•  Newer devices and procedures in use,  
•  Overuse of antibiotics for prevention of infection 
rather than for treatment,  
•  Use of Vabomere without complete assessment of 
whether it will work to treat the infection,  
•  More use in patients who have a very weak immune 
system, and  
•  An increase of resistant bacteria from the community.

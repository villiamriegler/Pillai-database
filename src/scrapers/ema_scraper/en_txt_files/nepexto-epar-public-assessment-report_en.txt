1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Lupin Healthcare UK Ltd submitted on 30 April 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nepexto, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 December 2016.   
During the evaluation, the applicant was transferred from Lupin Healthcare UK Ltd to Mylan IRE 
Healthcare Limited. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Nepexto in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Nepexto can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Nepexto is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in 
adults not previously treated with methotrexate. 
Nepexto, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression 
of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who 
have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Etanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral 
joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy.

Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or 
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
Nepexto, containing the active substance etanercept, has been developed as a biosimilar to the 
reference medicinal product Enbrel (etanercept). 
Etanercept is a recombinant human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein. It interferes 
with the soluble TNF-α by mimicking the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors 
that deactivate TNF-α and therefore down-regulate immune responses.  
The applicant applied for the full range of indications approved for the reference medicinal product 
Enbrel: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis 
(PA), axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) (ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic AxSpA), plaque 
psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis. 
Nepexto is presented in single-use pre-filled syringes containing 25 mg or 50 mg etanercept and in 
pre-filled pen containing 50 mg etanercept to be administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection. The 
applicant did not apply for the paediatric formulation, 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for 
injection.  
The recommended dose of etanercept is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once 
weekly. For paediatric patients, the dosage is based on body weight. Since the proposed pre-filled 
syringe and pen presentations do not have scaled unit indications, these formulations are not suitable 
for flexible dosing per kg body weight (BW). Paediatric patients who require a dose other than a full 25 
mg or 50 mg should not receive Nepexto. If an alternate dose is required, other etanercept products 
offering such an option should be used. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The marketing authorisation application (MAA) is submitted in accordance with Article 3(1) Indent 1 - 
Biotech medicinal product of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The proposal legal basis for this MAA is a 
similar biological application under Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. 
Similarity is claimed to the reference medicinal product Enbrel which was authorised in the European 
Union (EU) on the 3rd of February 2000 thus having been marketed for over 10 years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 10/84 
 
  
To demonstrate that the similar biological and reference products already authorised in the EU have 
similar profiles in terms of quality, safety and efficacy an extensive comparability exercise is required.  
The development programme of Nepexto is based on the relevant CHMP guidelines, particularly the 
guideline on ‘Similar Biological Medicinal Products’, so-called over-arching guideline (CHMP/437/04 
Rev. 1), the guideline on ‘Similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substance: quality issues’ (CHMP/BWP/247713/2012) and the guideline on ‘similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-
clinical and clinical issues’ (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1). 
Prior to initiation of the European Phase III programme, Scientific Advice (SA) was requested from the 
EMA in October 2014 and this advice was provided in November 2014 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/693250/2014; Procedure EMEA/H/SA/2891/1/2014/III). During this SA procedure 
the clinical model of moderate to severe RA was confirmed as sensitive and suitable to demonstrate 
biosimilarity between the test and the reference medicinal product. 
In line with the overarching guideline on similar biological medicinal products, extrapolation to other 
indications of the reference medicinal products could be acceptable, provided that biosimilarity has 
been demonstrated in one indication and with appropriate scientific justification.  
GMP inspections 
A pre-approval GMP inspection was conducted for the active substance and finished product 
manufacturing site at Lupin Limited (Biotech Division), India. Conformance with EU GMP requirements 
has been confirmed. 
GCP inspections  
A routine GCP inspection was carried out at two clinical sites of the pivotal phase III study YLB113-
002.  
In addition, during the clock-stop of this application, a triggered GCP inspection was performed for the 
clinical and analytical sites of the phase I study ETA.50/334 in order to verify the newly submitted 
pharmacokinetics data. 
It was concluded that the results of both GCP inspections are of sufficient quality to be used for the 
evaluation of the MAA.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Etanercept is a recombinant dimeric protein consisting of two soluble p75 TNFR (sTNFR2) molecules 
fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG1. The fusion protein is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Etanercept consists of 934 amino acids and has an 
apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. The protein contains the IgG1-specific N-
glycosylation sites, and the TNFR-related N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites in the 
receptor portion. 29 disulphide bonds are present in the correctly folded molecule. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Etanercept is recombinantly expressed by CHO cells. The active substance manufacturing process is a 
conventional process starting with generation of production batch from a working cell bank (WCB), 
upstream process includes cell expansion and target protein production. The subsequent downstream 
process includes purification through a series of chromatographic steps, virus inactivation and filtration 
steps leading to the active substance. 
The process description has been thoroughly revised during the procedure and a satisfactory level of 
detail has been included. 
Control of materials 
The target fusion protein TNFR:Fc is expressed in a CHO-dhfr cell line. Sufficient information on the 
host cell line in terms of origin, culture and storage conditions has been provided. The generation of 
the expression plasmid has been described in sufficient detail and information on the generation of the 
parental cell line has also been provided. 
Additional experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the clonality and genetic stability of the 
cell line. The cloning strategy has been sufficiently described. 
A two-tiered cell bank system, comprising master cell bank (MCB) and WCB was established. Release 
specifications and characterisation data of MCB and WCB were provided. Adequate tests to confirm the 
genetic stability of the MCB and end of production cell bank (EPCB) have been performed. A protocol 
for future qualification of new WCBs has been provided.  
A scale down production process was used to analyse end of production cells. The limit of in vitro cell 
age (LIVCA) for production is defined. Representativeness of scale down study for the production 
process is considered demonstrated and stability of EPCB is considered confirmed.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical and non-critical process parameters have been identified based on risk assessments and 
process characterisation studies. In-process controls and monitoring are employed to ensure product 
consistency. Safety relevant steps for the control of adventitious agents are largely controlled by 
critical process parameters and in-process controls.  
In addition to the PARs, the Applicant states NORs (normal operating ranges) and MORs (maximum 
operating ranges) within the PARs (proven acceptance ranges). The actions taken, if the process is 
operated beyond the respective limits, have been clearly stated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020

Overall, the proposed process control strategy is considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
The process validation batches were manufactured to demonstrate consistency of the process when 
run applying the defined NORs. In addition to the routinely performed in-process controls, additional 
tests were scheduled as per process validation protocol. The additional tests were performed to 
monitor depletion of misfolded forms, oxidised variants, host cell proteins (HCP), DNA, and residual 
protein A. The process parameters were held within the ranges as defined by NORs. The resulting 
active substance complied with the proposed specification.  
The criticality classification has been revised during the procedure. To demonstrate that the process 
validation batches still comply with the revised control strategy, the Applicant has submitted 
comparative tables on IPC, IPT (for the USP) and testing of quality attributes (for the down-stream 
process (DSP) intermediates) of the process validation (PV) batches versus “consistency batches” that 
were manufactured recently according to the revised control strategy. These data support that the 
process was not altered by the revision of the control strategy, and that the process can be considered 
in a validated state. 
Product Quality Reviews (PQR) of the last two years have been provided. The data provided support 
process consistency.  
The process capabilities in depletion of some of the process related impurities has been demonstrated 
with spiking studies. DNA, HCP, and residual protein A) are routinely tested at active substance 
release. Thus, additional information on the depletion studies is not considered necessary.  
Upstream and downstream batch size is appropriately defined. 
Manufacturing process development 
Nepexto was developed as biosimilar to Enbrel. The process development, including several process 
versions, has been described.  Changes during development includes process optimizations and scale 
up. An analytical comparability study was performed, and no considerable differences were observed; 
to address residual uncertainty an additional PK study using the proposed commercial product has 
been performed (see clinical section). 
Characterisation 
The etanercept active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a 
recombinant dimeric protein. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. 
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size 
and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. In summary, 
the characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Criticality assessment was used to decide upon the need to perform clearance studies for process- and 
product-related impurities. Following this pre-assessment some clearance studies were conducted for 
HCP, HC DNA, media components, antifoam C, viruses, High Molecular Weight (HMW) forms, misfolded 
and degraded forms. Overall, no problems arise from residuals in the active substance as these are 
either cleared to acceptable/sufficient levels or/and are controlled at release of the active substance.

Specification 
The active substance specification contains parameters like identity, glycan content, biological activity, 
purity and impurities, endotoxin, content and bioburden. Other general tests like visual inspection, pH 
are also included in the specification. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
The Applicant has provided batch data for several active substance lots from different scales and 
versions of the manufacturing process. The results were within specifications and confirm consistency 
of manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The approach to qualify in-house primary and secondary reference standards is acceptable. Newly 
provided specifications for qualification of reference standards (in-house primary and secondary 
reference standard) are based on the agreed ranges for quality attributes of etanercept. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container. 
The applicant has provided long term stability data from multiple development and commercial scale 
batches 
The analytical methods used for stability testing are stability indicating and the same as for release. 
All batches were stable at accelerated conditions.  
The proposed shelf life and storage conditions are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Nepexto finished product is a sterile‚ clear to opalescent and colourless to yellow liquid for 
subcutaneous administration and is formulated at pH 6.3 ± 0.2. Nepexto is presented as:  
- 50 mg/ml of etanercept solution for injection in 1 ml pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
- 25 mg/0.5 ml of etanercept solution for injection in 1 ml PFS 
- 50 mg/ml of etanercept solution for injection in a disposable 1 ml pre-filled pen (PFP). 
Nepexto finished product consists of Etanercept as active substance and excipients are glycine, 
trisodium citrate dihydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sucrose, sodium chloride and 
water for injections. 
The function of all formulation components is indicated and found acceptable. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. Due to patent constraints a new etanercept 
formulation different to the reference product Enbrel was developed. Based on the results of 
appropriate formulation development studies, finally arginine was replaced by glycine and di-sodium 
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate by sodium citrate. This formulation was demonstrated to ensure 
satisfactory stability of etanercept. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 14/84 
 
  
 
During finished product manufacturing process development the Applicant sufficiently evaluated the 
individual finished product manufacturing steps and their impact on product quality. Appropriate 
studies were conducted to confirm the compatibility between the finished product solution and the 
equipment used in the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the filters utilised for bulk filtration were 
appropriately validated with respect to bubble point, compatibility with the bulk product, bacterial 
retention capacity, potential adsorption of the active substance as well as extractables and leachables. 
The target fill volumes were appropriately evaluated for the filling process and are considered justified. 
Moreover, the integrity of the PFS after insertion of the plunger stopper was satisfactorily 
demonstrated by appropriate leakage tests. Finally, it was shown that freeze thaw cycles do not 
compromise Nepexto quality. 
Extractables and leachables of the primary packaging were adequately studied by use of a set of 
analytical methods. The results confirm that no relevant leaching occur which might affect safety or 
quality of the finished product up to its end of shelf life. 
The primary packaging is clear type I glass with fluorotec-coated bromobutyl rubber stopper.  
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process solely consists of dispensing active substance lots, 
filtration and filling of the bulk solution into the syringes. In addition, the manufacturing processes are 
described with sufficient detail.  
Holding times during the manufacturing operation are justified based on development data. as well as 
duration times for mixing, filtration and filling. Critical process parameters are defined. Their operating 
ranges were adequately evaluated by process characterisation studies. The classification of the process 
parameters according to their criticality is sufficiently justified. 
Pre- and post-filtration filter integrity tests are conducted and their classification is justified.  
Process validation was performed at both manufacturing sites using full scale consecutive batches of 
PFS and PFP. All samples collected across the manufacturing process and tested met the predefined 
acceptance criteria. Additional parameters that were measured for process validation purposes were 
also within the specified ranges. Validation data are also presented for the PFP assembly process. The 
results confirm consistent pen quality in terms of appearance and performance. Moreover, the aseptic 
part of the manufacturing process is adequately validated by media fill. Overall, the validation data 
demonstrate that the manufacturing processes are capable to consistently produce Nepexto PFS and 
PFP of intended quality 
Product specification  
The specification for the finished product includes test parameters on identity, pharmaceutical 
properties, potency, content, purity and impurities, safety, syringe functionality and device testing.  
The proposed PFS finished product specification is adequate for a satisfactory control of the sterile 
finished product solution. All acceptance criteria have been appropriately justified. The in-house 
analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. 
The components of the primary packaging are glass syringe (clear type I glass) with a staked stainless 
steel 27-gauge needle and a rigid needle shield consisting of a polyisoprene rubber and a 
polypropylene shield. Fluorotec coated bromobutyl rubber is used as plunger stopper. The components

are purchased pre-sterilised. The sterilisation procedures and the manufacturers responsible for the 
sterilisation are stated. Furthermore, it is confirmed that sterilisation is conducted in line with the 
respective ISO standards.  
Appropriate information on the disposable pen is presented which confirms conformance of the pen 
with the essential requirements of medical device legislation. It was further demonstrated that the pen 
complies with the requirements of the relevant quality standards (ISO 116081 and ISO 11608-5) with 
regard to functionality. The essential pen performance parameters are included in the pen specification 
and are routinely monitored at release and in the stability studies. The designed pen contains 
appropriate visual and audible features to assist the patients for proper handling. It is reported that 
the pen design was verified by Human Factor Studies with patients suffering from Rheumatoid 
Arthritis.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of various scales of the finished product were provided. Release results of finished 
product batches have been presented covering all strengths and presentations. The results are within 
the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
An International reference standard (Compendial or International Bureau Standard) was not available 
for Etanercept. Therefore, the Reference product (Enbrel) was used as reference standard for all the 
tests during the initial stages of product development. Following that, the internal reference standard 
was prepared and qualified against the international reference standard (BRP) for potency assay. 
Stability of the product 
The claimed finished product shelf-life is 2 years when stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  
Appropriate stability studies have been initiated at the two manufacturing sites in line with the 
respective ICH requirements.  
Stability data from PFS 50 mg/mL batches are available covering the proposed shelf life of 24 months. 
All these batches contain active substance from different lots. The stability data provided is sufficient 
to provide evidence on PFS 50 mg/mL stability. This data also support PFP shelf life of 24 months as 
the stability results of the physicochemical parameters of the PFS are considered representative for the 
PFP. For the PFS 25 mg/0.5 mL data from two stability batches has been presented, one of them only 
for 12 months. Nevertheless, a shelf life of 24 months may be accepted for PFS 25 mg/0.5 mL based 
on data of the 50 mg/mL strength as the two presentations do not differ in protein concentration 
rather than in the fill volume.    
Multiple batches of Nepexto have also been introduced into the stability studies, for PFS 25 mg/0.5 mL 
and PFS 50 mg/mL. All batches were manufactured by using the same active substance lot, at least in 
parts, and thus, cannot be considered completely independent. In order to comply with the 
requirements of ICH Q5C, additional commercial scale batches manufactured at the Lupin 
manufacturing site will be put on storage. Results of 12 months storage at recommended storage 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 16/84 
 
  
conditions and 6 months at accelerated conditions are currently available from the ongoing stability 
studies. All results met the specification acceptance criteria. Since no significant difference in the 
stability results of the batches manufactured at the different sites has been observed so far, a shelf life 
of 24 months for the product manufactured at the Lupin site is considered acceptable as well.  
Results from studies performed at accelerated stability condition at 25°C ± 2°C; 60 ± 5% RH show 
parameters within specifications but with various trends for increase of impurities and decrease of 
potency.  
The finished product was subjected to various stress conditions to understand degradation pathways 
and underlying impurities. 
Results from this study suggests that Etanercept is susceptible to exposure to light, oxidizing agents, 
agitation and high temperature stress factors. Percentage impurities generated and rate of degradation 
is less for Lupin’s in-house batches when compared to innovator from different geographies for all 
stress factors except for incubation at 45°C. 
Temperature excursion studies have been initiated using representative finished product lots to 
support a storage of 4 weeks at room temperature for ambulant use as described in the SmPC. 
Currently, stability data of 12 months storage at 25.0 ± 2.0°C/60.0 ± 5.0% RH are available. The 
results confirm satisfactory stability of the product under these conditions. Finally, the results of the 
photostability studies confirm that the finished product is susceptible to light and must be stored in the 
secondary packaging. A respective storage instruction is included in the SmPC. 
The finished product shelf life is 2 years when stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). The finished product 
should not be frozen. The pre-filled syringes or pens should be kept in the outer carton in order to 
protect from light. 
Nepexto may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a single period of up to four 
weeks; after which, it should not be refrigerated again. Nepexto should be discarded if not used within 
four weeks of removal from refrigeration. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no animal-derived materials used in the manufacturing process except one raw material 
used in cell line establishment. The cell banks (MCB, WCB and EOPCs) have been comprehensively 
characterized regarding adventitious agents. A virus validation study analyzing the viral clearance 
capacity of the etanercept manufacturing process has been performed comprising several process 
steps (AEX, HIC, MMC, Protein A chromatography, low pH, viral filtration) in small scale models. The 
virus validation study reports and the qualification of the models have been provided and support the 
validity and adequacy of the virus clearance capacity of the manufacturing process.

N/A 
Biosimilarity  
Evaluation of biosimilarity was split into two parts and three campaigns.  
“Historical” similarity evaluation (Part A) was conducted during various developmental stages of the 
active substance and finished product and included for comparison of reference product (Enbrel) from 
EU, Japan and India. Some basic structural elucidation studies were completed and evaluated. No 
remarkable concerns were identified; the Company presented the correct amino acid sequence and 
correct pattern of the 29 disulfide bonds along with the most frequently observed “misbonded” bridge 
positions that lead to misfolded forms of etanercept. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 17/84 
 
  
The “Side-by-Side” analytical similarity exercise which is the process-relevant biosimilarity exercise 
comprises several analytical campaigns.  
Generally, inherent structural quality attributes related to the protein backbone (such as amino acid 
sequence, disulfide bonding, secondary, tertiary and higher order structure) are comparable between 
Nepexto and Enbrel. Differences exist in the glycosylation profiles (N- and O-glycans). 
As regards N-glycan structures, differences exist in the amount of total mannosylated glycoforms 
(mostly outside the Enbrel range) and the amount of afucosylated forms (at or above the upper Enbrel 
range). The amount of galactosylated glycoforms is shifted to the upper Enbrel range and outside the 
range. The amount of sialylated glycoforms is considered similar. The differences in high mannose 
content and afucosylated structures could be assigned to the Fc part of the molecule while the slight 
differences in galactosylated forms are located on the TNFR-part of the molecule. The overall 
sialylation is fairly comparable between test and reference product. Investigations on the N-
glycosylation profiles were adequately performed; the new comparability exercise confirmed the results 
of the first exercise based on a more representative data pool. 
Data presented on comparability of O-glycosylation have been sufficiently amended by new data and 
justification. In the comparability exercises, the level of disialylated glycans is slightly higher for 
Nepexto compared to Enbrel while the level of monosialylated O-glycans is conversely slightly lower. 
The potential impact of the differences in glycosylation is addressed in the various biological assays as 
detailed below. 
For functional characterization of TNFR and Fc the number of lots investigated was significantly 
increased in the new comparability exercise to support the representativeness of product and process. 
The comparability studies showed that the difference in afucosylated structures resulted in a difference 
in the ADCC assay. However, as the assay was designed as a hypersensitive assay the result was rated 
as “over-discriminatory” and the Applicant showed in additional assay formats with ADCC-positive and 
-negative antibody controls that the overall ADCC could be disregarded for etanercept compared to the 
positive controls. This is also in line with previous evaluations of etanercept products. Thus, the 
structural differences observed for glycan structures do not have any impact on functional parameters 
tested. 
Generally, in comparability exercises the difference in glycosylation did not translate into any other 
remarkable difference in the various potency and binding assays.  
Differences are observed in N- and C-terminal heterogeneity of Nepexto and Enbrel. Etanercept is 
almost fully processed to the C-1 variant missing lysine and this impacts the charge profile of Nepexto 
compared to Enbrel that has a small proportion of lysine-carrying variants. Nepexto also has lower 
amounts of N-terminal variants (N-1, N-2). Similarity can be concluded on this attribute as no impact 
is expected from variability in N- and C-termini for etanercept. This is confirmed by both similarity 
studies. 
Comparable or lower amounts of oxidized methionines, deamidated asparagines, of aggregates or 
misfolded forms are found for Nepexto. As regards the charge profile a lower number of basic variants 
is found for Nepexto consequential to the almost fully processed C-terminal variant without lysine. This 
has been concluded above to have no impact on the molecular function of etanercept. 
A small study of similarity of finished product related attributes (protein content, extinction coefficient, 
subvisible particles) was conducted and did not result in any remarkable difference between Nepexto 
and Enbrel. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 18/84 
 
  
The comparability exercise is based on a sufficiently large sample size and uses independent batches of 
active substance that were not pooled. Results are sufficiently representative of the commercial 
process. Hence, a positive conclusion on biosimilarity can be drawn.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of the tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Several quality major objections have been raised during the procedure regarding GMP, biosimilarity 
reference standards, manufacturing process description and the control strategy which were 
appropriately resolved during the review. 
Conformance with EU GMP requirements of the active substance and finished product manufacturing 
site at Lupin Limited (Biotech Division) was confirmed during the procedure by providing the respective 
GMP certificate, confirming compliance with EU GMP status. 
The active substance manufacturing process description and control strategy has been thoroughly 
revised and adequately supplemented during the procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020

Further information has been provided regarding the active substance manufacturing process 
consistency which was found acceptable. 
Information on impurities and associated analytical methods was substantially complemented during 
the MAA procedure and is now satisfactory. 
Procedures for qualification of reference standards were amended during the assessment all allow for 
appropriate control of the active substance and the finished product. 
Active substance stability data was amended and clarified. 
The data presented to support the biosimilarity claim was significantly amended. In conclusion, an 
extensive analytical comparability exercise has been conducted and demonstrates that Nepexto is 
highly similar to the reference product Enbrel. 
Additionally, the Applicant is recommended to introduce the first two commercial scale batches of 
Nepexto finished product manufactured at Lupin, India manufacturing site into ICH compliant stability 
studies. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
To introduce the first two commercial scale batches of Nepexto finished product manufactured at 
Lupin, India manufacturing site into ICH compliant stability studies. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical programme for Nepexto (also referred as the company code YLB113 in the report) 
consisted of comparative in vitro studies with Enbrel sourced from India, Europe and Japan, 
comparative in vivo pharmacology (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity studies with Enbrel 
sourced from India and Japan and non-comparative toxicity studies conducted with Nepexto alone.  
Scientific advice regarding the product development program of Nepexto was given by the EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/693250/2014; Procedure EMEA/H/SA/2891/1/2014/III). The package of non-
clinical in vivo studies provided by the Applicant was not supported and was not considered necessary 
in the frame of a comparability exercise for a biosimilar as proposed in the current EU biosimilar 
guidelines. 
In accordance with the requirements of the ‘Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical issues’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), the comparative in vitro studies carried out with Enbrel from 
EU or Japan are considered paramount relevant for the present MA application, while the other studies 
are considered informative only.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
TNF is an important cytokine in the inflammatory process of RA. The primary mechanism of action of 
etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing 
TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive.  
The comparability of Nepexto and Enbrel was evaluated in vitro in TNF binding and neutralisation 
assays and in Fc effector functional assays, related to the antibody part of the fusion protein (see Table 
above). The discussion concerning the results of these in vitro studies, which are considered 
paramount for the non-clinical biosimilar comparability exercise, is provided in section 3.1 ‘Quality 
aspects’, subsection ‘Biosimilarity’ of this assessment report. 
In vivo studies 
A comparative in vivo pharmacodynamic study was conducted to demonstrate similar anti-arthritic 
activity of Nepexto and Enbrel (sourced from India) in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis 
(study ABD-2994). 
The anti-arthritic activity was evaluated by investigating arthritic score, paw swelling and joint 
histological damage and cartilage erosion. I.p. doses of 0.1, 1, 10 and 50 µg Nepexto respectively 
Enbrel were applied daily for two weeks following arthritis induction by Bovine collagen type 2 in 
Freud’s adjuvants. 
Nepexto showed a dose-dependent anti-arthritic activity (at doses ≥ approximately 0.2-fold the 
equivalent human 50 mg clinical dose, assuming a mouse body weight (BW) of 25 g, a mouse to 
human conversion factor of 12.3, and a human BW of 60 kg). Effects of Nepexto and Enbrel on arthritic 
score and paw swelling appeared to be comparable. However, with regard to histopathology scoring 
(joint inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage damage, bone resorption) and for residual anti-
arthritic activity three weeks after treatment termination, Nepexto appeared to be slightly more potent 
(i.e. already effective at lower doses) than Enbrel.

Secondary pharmacodynamics, Safety pharmacology, Pharmacodynamic 
drug interactions studies 
In line with the current EU biosimilar guidelines no studies have been provided by the applicant.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Nepexto was investigated and compared with Enbrel in a 4-week repeat 
dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in Cynomolgus monkeys (S48117, versus Japan-sourced Enbrel, 
considered pivotal) and in a single dose study conducted in Swiss albino mice (study BIO-BN019, 
versus India-sourced Enbrel, therefore considered informative only). 
In both studies, etanercept (Nepexto, Enbrel) plasma levels were determined by an ELISA assay, 
validated in accordance with the EMA ‘Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). 
Absorption  
Study BIO-BN 011: Single dose mouse study 
The 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC between test (Test 1: 
Nepexto´s etanercept drug substance applied in the innovator formulation; Test 2: Nepexto´s etanercept 
drug  substance  applied  in  Nepexto´s  modified  formulation)  and  reference  (India-sourced  Enbrel)  was 
found to be within a range of 0.8 and 1.25, whereby formally establishing bioequivalence of Nepexto´s 
etanercept drug substance when applied in either formulation. 
Study  S48117:  Etanercept  drug  substance:  4-week  toxicity  study  in  the  Cynomolgus  monkey  by  s.c.  
administration with a 2-week recovery period - toxicokinetic evaluation  
The pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic profile of Nepexto etanercept drug substance was assessed after s.c. 
administration to Cynomolgus monkeys twice a week for a period of 4 weeks at doses of 1, 5 or 15 
mg/kg on day 1 and day 22 of the study. The toxicokinetic profile of Enbrel (Japan-sourced), 
administrated at 15 mg/kg, was assessed for comparison. 
Serum etanercept levels (Nepexto or Enbrel) were quantifiable in all animals dosed with 1, 5 and 15 
mg/kg. Exposure values obtained for Nepexto and Enbrel (15 mg/kg) were similar on day 1 and were 
comparable for males and females. Median time to maximum etanercept concentration (tmax) ranged 
from 24 to 36 hours in males and females at the different dose levels on day 1 and 22.  
Serum etanercept levels increased with dose. For AUCt, the increase showed about dose-
proportionality, while Cmax-values for the 5 mg/kg dose were higher than theoretically expected.  
Following repeated administration, a notable decrease of etanercept exposure was observed for most 
animals, especially those exposed to the low and intermediate dose, which appeared to be correlated 
with the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) detected in most of these cases. It was not evaluated 
whether the induced ADA were neutralizing or not neutralizing. AUCt and Cmax on day 22 were higher 
for Nepexto drug substance than for Enbrel, which could possibly be related to a higher incidence of 
ADA in the Enbrel-treated animals (see also Section 2.3.4. Toxicology). 
Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
In line with the current EU biosimilar guidelines, no studies have been provided by the applicant.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Four GLP-compliant single dose toxicity studies were conducted by both s.c. and i.v. administration of 
Nepexto to mice and rats (according to the current EU biosimilar guidelines, such studies are not 
considered necessary for a biosimilar MAA). No noteworthy findings were observed for s.c. and i.v.  
Nepexto doses of up to 500 mg/kg (mice), respectively 250 mg/kg (rats). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Three GLP-compliant 4-week repeat dose toxicity studies with a two-week recovery period were 
conducted in mice, rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys by s.c. administration, which is the intended way 
for clinical application

No toxicologically relevant systemic findings were observed with Nepexto doses of up to 15 mg/kg and 
with Enbrel (Japan-sourced) at a dose of 15 mg/kg, given s.c. twice a week. 
Histological findings at the injection sites (mononuclear cell foci with subcutaneous fibrosis and 
granulomatous inflammation) were of slight intensity and were present in all groups, including the 
control group. 
Toxicokinetics: see section 2.3.3 ‘Absorption’ of this assessment report.  
Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, Reproductive and development toxicity 
In line with the current EU biosimilar guidelines, no studies have been provided by the applicant.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was investigated during the repeated dose toxicity studies in mice (Study No. 418-1-
02-1405) and Cynomolgus monkeys (Study S48117).  
- In the mouse study (with India-sourced Enbrel as comparator), a treatment-related local reaction of 
granulocyte and MNC infiltration was seen at the site of injection (subcutaneous tissue) in Nepexto and 
in Enbrel-treated groups which appeared to be reversible during the 14-day recovery period.  
- In the Cynomolgus monkey study (with Japan-sourced Enbrel as comparator), histological findings at 
the injection sites (mononuclear cell foci with subcutaneous fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation) 
were of slight intensity and were present in all groups, including the control group.

Other toxicity studies 
The immunogenicity of Nepexto’s etanercept drug substance and of (Japan-sourced) Enbrel was 
investigated in the 4-week repeated dose s.c. toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (Study S48117; 
see section 2.3.3 ‘Absorption’ and section 2.3.4 ‘Repeat Dose Toxicity’ of this assessment report).  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided a justification for not submitting any environmental risk assessment studies 
based on the fact that etanercept is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the 
environment which is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nepexto was developed to be a biosimilar product to the EU reference product Enbrel and, in 
accordance with the current EU biosimilar guidelines, the non-clinical evaluation was mainly 
comparative in nature and designed to detect differences in the pharmaco-toxicological response 
between Nepexto and the RMP Enbrel. 
The non-clinical programme comprised comparative in vitro TNF binding studies and Fc-related 
functional assays, comparative in vivo pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies and non-
comparative toxicity studies conducted with Nepexto alone. 
In vitro studies: As clearly expressed in the EMA scientific advice given to the Applicant, according to 
the current EMA biosimilar guidelines the assessment of in vitro differences in receptor binding and 
biological activity between Nepexto and the RMP Enbrel is considered paramount for providing non-
clinical evidence for biosimilarity. The assessment of the data submitted for Nepexto concerning in 
vitro TNF binding and functional activity is provided in section 3.1 ‘Quality aspects’, subsection 
‘Biosimilarity’ of this AR. 
In vivo studies: According to the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1), a step-wise approach is recommended. If the in vitro 
comparability exercise is considered satisfactory and no factors of concern are identified, in vivo animal 
studies may not be necessary.  
A large amount of in vivo animal data has been submitted by the Applicant for Nepexto, both from 
comparative and non-comparative studies and with different RMPs: 
•  Studies comparing Nepexto to India-sourced Enbrel:  
- 
- 
- 
an efficacy study in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model  
a mouse single dose s.c. pharmacokinetic study  
a 4-week s.c. repeat dose toxicity study in mice  
•  A study comparing Nepexto to Japan-sourced Enbrel:  
-  A 4-week s.c. repeat dose toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys, including toxicokinetic and 
immunogenicity assessment  
•  Additional non-comparative studies in mice, rats, and rabbits for evaluation of single and repeat 
dose toxicity of Nepexto. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 26/84 
 
  
In the EMA scientific advice given to the Applicant, it was pointed out, that the package of non-clinical 
in vivo studies provided for Nepexto is not considered necessary in the frame of a comparability 
exercise for a biosimilar as proposed in the current EU biosimilar guidelines. 
It was explained by the Applicant that the non-clinical in vivo studies had been requested by non-EU 
regulatory authorities and that they had already been completed when asking for scientific advice by 
the EMA. On the other hand, the fact that the Applicant has not provided (i) pharmacodynamic studies 
on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions, (ii)  
pharmacokinetic studies on distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
and (iii) toxicity studies concerning genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction and development is 
in accordance with the recommendations given in the current EU biosimilar guidelines for a biosimilar 
MAA. 
Besides these general comments on the necessity of in vivo studies as part of the non-clinical 
biosimilar comparability exercise, the following issues had been initially identified in context with the 
specific non-clinical in vivo studies submitted by the Applicant for Nepexto and have been resolved or 
been decided not to be followed further: 
● TNFalpha-binding in different species: In vivo animal studies with Nepexto have been performed in 
different species. However, information concerning the potency of etanercept for TNFalpha-binding in 
the different species has not been provided. 
● Nepexto batches used in the in vivo animal studies: Information to what extent the Nepexto batches 
used in the non-clinical in vivo studies are comparable to the batches used in the pivotal clinical studies 
has been asked for and has been provided by the Applicant. 
● Studies using India-sourced Enbrel as RMP: In vivo animal studies using India-sourced Enbrel can 
only be regarded as informative as India is not an ICH member. According to EMA’s overarching 
biosimilar guideline (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1), a non EEA sourced RMP ‘will need to be authorised by a 
regulatory authority with similar scientific and regulatory standards as EMA (i.e. ICH countries)’. In this 
context, the potential clinical relevance of the difference observed in anti-arthritic activity (with regard 
to the evaluated histopathological parameters) between Nepexto and India-sourced Enbrel in the 
mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis cannot be reliably assessed. 
● Study using Japan-sourced Enbrel as RMP: The applicant has provided adequate comparative data to 
support an acceptable analytical bridge between Japan-sourced Enbrel and EU-sourced Enbrel and to 
justify the use of Japan-sourced Enbrel as a comparator in the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study with 
a 2-week recovery period in Cynomolgus monkeys. However, interpretation of the toxicity study is 
hampered by the fact that similarity of initial process  material with lower amount of misfolds and sialic 
acid used in the toxicity study to improved process material (used clinically) is not considered given 
(see section 3.1 ‘Quality aspects’, subsection ‘Biosimilarity’ of this assessment report) and (small) 
differences with regard to PK, PD, and safety, including immunogenicity, cannot be excluded. 
● Differences in anti-drug antibody formation: In the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys, following repeated application, exposure on day 22 to Japan-sourced Enbrel was lower than 
exposure to Nepexto, which was considered to be related to an increased incidence of ADA formation in 
the Enbrel group. However, as outlined in the “Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic 
proteins” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1), the comparison of the ADA response to the 
biosimilar and the RMP in an animal model is not recommended as part of the biosimilar comparability 
exercise, due to the low predictive value for the immunogenic potential in humans (however, as in this 
case, may be needed to aid in the interpretation of the toxicokinetic data).

The applicant did not submit ERA studies with the appropriate justification in line with the Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr 2).   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Taken together, the submitted non-clinical data (and here in particular the in vitro TNF binding and Fc 
effector functional assay data, see section 3.1 ‘Quality aspects’, subsection ‘Biosimilarity’ of this 
assessment report) support the biosimilarity between Nepexto and Enbrel. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant carried out three phase I PK studies in healthy volunteers, one in India, one in Japan, 
and one in Jordan (conducted during clock-stop) to support the application in the EU. The latest PK 
study in Jordan (study ETA.50/334) was required since the two previously conducted studies could not 
be accepted as a proof of similarity between Nepexto and the Enbrel reference medicinal product.  
In addition, the applicant performed a multi-national, double-blinded, phase III equivalence trial 
(YLB113-002) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Europe, India, Ukraine and Japan. 
The above-mentioned clinical trials supporting the clinical development programme are presented in  
table 4. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
A routine GCP inspection was carried out at two clinical sites of the phase III study (YLB113-002) 
following a request from the CHMP, dated 28 June 2018, in connection with the evaluation of the MAA 
for Nepexto. No critical findings were found but some major and minor findings were observed. The 
observations, which were considered to be in the responsibility of the investigator sites are sites 
specific and are unlikely to affect the validity of the data.  
A triggered GCP inspection was carried out at the clinical and analytical sites of the phase I PK study 
(ETA.50/334) conducted during the clock-stop of this application. The request was due to the pivotal 
nature of the study in order to verify the newly submitted PK data. The major findings observed at 
these two sites were considered system-related and could therefore potentially have an impact on the 
quality of all study data. It is overall concluded that overall reliability of the data is not affected despite 
the major findings that were made and the reported clinical and PK data of the study ETA.50/334 are 
considered to be of sufficient quality to be used for the evaluation of the MAA.  
Furthermore, the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside 
the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three phases I PK studies in healthy volunteers were conducted to support the PK clinical programme: 
•  Study ETA.50/334 (main study): single dose, PK and safety study conducted in Jordan in 
healthy volunteers (n=52) comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel EU-source 
•  Study YLB113-001 (informative study): single dose, PK and safety study conducted in Japan in 
healthy volunteers (n=60), comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel Japan-sourced, previously 
designed as the pivotal PK study 
•  Study LBC-14-155 (informative study): single dose, PK and safety study conducted in India in 
health volunteers (n=58) comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel India-sourced, presented for 
information and not supportive of the present MAA  
Studies YLB113-001 and LBC-14-155 were performed using material from the manufacturing process 
which contains lower amounts of misfolded forms and sialic acids per molecule of etanercept as 
compared to the proposed commercial process. Thus, the product used in these phase I studies cannot 
be considered representative of the proposed commercial product 
Furthermore, study LBC-14-155 was conducted at the contract research organisation (CRO) which was 
inspected by Austrian and Dutch authorities in February 2016. The inspections identified several 
concerns at the company's sites regarding misrepresentation of study data and deficiencies in 
documentation and data handling. This triggered an Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC referral 
procedure which concluded that data from studies conducted at the sites between June 2012 and June 
2016 are unreliable and cannot be accepted as a basis for MA in the EU 1. Since Study LBC-14-155 was 
conducted during that time frame, the results cannot be taken into a consideration in this application. 
The study ETA.50/334 was conducted during the clock-stop after the two previously conducted PK 
studies (YLB113-001, LBC-14-155) could not be accepted as a proof of similarity between Nepexto and 
Enbrel. Study ETA.50/334 is considered as the main PK study in the context of the present MAA. 
Study ETA.50/334 (main study) 
This was an open label, randomised, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover, balanced, 
single dose comparative PK study.  
The study was conducted during the clock-stop period of the evaluation.  
The test product is declared to represent current manufacturing and therefore to be representative for 
the to-be commercialised finished product. EU-sourced Enbrel reference product was used. 
Design 
The study design is presented in Figure 1. The study duration was approximately 50 days and started 
on admission day of period I and ended by giving the last blood sample in period II. Washout period 
was 28 days between doses.

Figure 1 Schematic chart of the study ETA.50/334 (crossover design) 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the relative bioavailability of etanercept between Nepexto  
50 mg solution and the reference product Enbrel 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringes for 
subcutaneous use. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate and compare the overall safety, tolerability and local 
tolerance of Nepexto 50 mg solution and Enbrel 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringes for 
subcutaneous use. 
Study population 
The subjects were 51 healthy adult male subjects from Jordan population, 18 to 50 (inclusive) years 
old. 
Treatment 
Single dose (1 mL) of either test product (A - Nepexto) or reference product (B- EU sourced Enbrel) 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringes for subcutaneous use was administered to the subjects 
slowly by subcutaneous route in the abdomen (except for the 5 cm area right around the navel) as per 
the randomisation schedule in a supine posture. 
Analytical method 
Etanercept was measured by a validated ELISA assay. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical evaluation 
ANOVA analysis (testing the sequence, subjects’ nested within sequence, product and period effect) 
using 5 % significance level was done for log-transformed and untransformed data for Cmax, AUC0-t, 
and AUC0-∞,and for the untransformed data of Tmax, AUC_%Extrap_obs, t1/2, Kel, Vd & Cl. 
Pharmacokinetic equivalence of the test product (A) with reference product (B) for Etanercept was 
Assessment report

demonstrated if: The 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the geometric least squares mean for ln-
transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ falls within the acceptance range of 
80.00%-125.00%. Median was used upon reporting Tmax values unlike all other parameters where 
mean was used.

Due to potential carry-over effects in period II indicated by a pre-administration blood concentration 
potentially higher than 5% Cmax in 5 subjects, a revised PK analysis was provided by the applicant 
excluding these subjects (Table 7). 
The acceptance criteria of 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC are well within the 80-125% 
acceptance range. Therefore, the exclusion of these subjects does not change the overall conclusion on 
bioequivalence.

Study YLB113-001 (informative study) 
This Japanese study was a double-blind, randomised, two-way crossover trial to investigate the safety 
and bioavailability of Nepexto compared to Enbrel administered as a single subcutaneous dose of a 
buffered aqueous solution formulation (25 mg) in healthy male subjects compared to the same dose of 
the reference product.

For both primary PK parameters AUCt and Cmax, values were significantly higher for the test product as 
compared to the reference (ratios AUCt 1.12 [1.03-1.21], Cmax 1.13 [1.04-1.22]). However, compliance 
with the pre-defined 80-125% acceptance criteria for the 90% CI was shown. In terms of elimination 
half live, very similar values for both products were calculated (t1/2: test 115.14 hrs, reference  
114.83 hrs). 
Study LBC-14-155 (informative study) 
This was an open label, balanced, randomised, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, 
crossover, comparative pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics study of etanercept 50 mg solution for 
injection for subcutaneous injection manufactured by Lupin Limited, India and Enbrel (Etanercept 50 
mg) Solution for Injection for subcutaneous injection manufactured by John Wyeth and Brother Ltd. 
The study was initiated in 58 healthy male adult subjects. Indian sourced Enbrel reference product was 
used. The study is considered as informative only. 
Of 58 enrolled subjects, 16 subjects were absent for subsequent period, missed consecutive blood 
draws or were withdrawn due to adverse event (AE). 
A minimum washout period between two dosing periods of 28 days was observed. This is acceptable 
given an expected elimination half-life of about 70 hours. However, in 4 subjects pre-dose levels were 
above 5% of the individual Cmax. These subjects were excluded.  
The results are presented for information only.

hence excluded 
Equivalence was reached with regard to the primary PK endpoints AUC0-480, AUCinf and Cmax since the 
90% CIs for the respective GMRs were within the predefined equivalence margins of 80-125%. As in 
the Japanese PK study, point estimates were > 1 (Cmax 105.27 [93.80-118.15], AUC0-480 108.80 
[98.73-119.90], AUCinf 107.79 [98.41-118.08]). In this case, however, the difference between the test 
and the reference product was not significant. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Etanercept is a recombinant human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75Fc fusion protein. It interferes 
with the soluble TNF α by mimicking the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors 
that deactivate TNF-α and therefore down-regulate immune responses. Etanercept acts as a decoy 
receptor for TNF-α, reducing TNF-α effects and hence represents a competitive TNF-α inhibitor. 
In accordance with EU guidance (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 42832/2005; EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), 
clinical evidence for comparability/similarity can be demonstrated by pharmacodynamics (PD) 
surrogate endpoints or clinical evidence. In case of Nepexto, clinical evidence for similarity was aimed 
to be demonstrated by clinical rather than PD endpoints. The applicant did not submit clinical studies 
on the PD of etanercept. This is acceptable. 
In the bioequivalence study LBC-14-155, that is informative for the purpose of MA due the limitations 
explained in introduction (Section 2.4.1. ), levels of TNF-α were measured to determine comparative 
effect of Nepexto and Enbrel on inhibition of TNF-α in an in-vitro test system as measured by recovery 
of TNF-α. 
The TNF-α concentration in healthy subjects was too low to demonstrate an additional drop achieved 
by etanercept. To circumvent the problem and to demonstrate a PD effect of etanercept, a fixed 
predetermined concentration of TNF-α was added into the sample containing etanercept. The in vitro 
neutralisation of TNF-α is demonstrated by a drop in the TNF-α concentration. The measurement of 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 37/84 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
depletion of artificially added TNF-α in human serum samples was based on an in-vitro assay using 
human serum as a matrix.  
Prior to etanercept administration (Time 0.00 hrs) and after addition of the fixed TNF-α amount, the 
TNF-α concentrations were around 14 ng/ml. Measurable TNF-α concentrations in the samples declined 
very rapidly after etanercept administration to about 10 ng/ml at 12 hrs post-dosing. This value was 
maintained throughout the rest of the sampling period at 480 hrs. Consistent results were observed for 
the test and reference product. Due to the artificial character of the in vitro test setting and to the 
limitations pertaining to this study, these results cannot be interpreted to draw conclusions on 
biosimilarity between the test and reference product. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study (ETA 50/334), conducted in Jordan during the clock-stop of this application, was considered 
pivotal for the comparative PK evaluation between Nepexto and Enbrel.  
At the CHMP request, a GCP inspection was carried out at the clinical and analytical sites of the study. 
The request was due to the pivotal nature of the study in order to verify the newly submitted PK data. 
The major findings observed at these two sites were considered system-related and could therefore 
potentially have an impact on the quality of all study data. It is concluded that overall reliability of the 
data is not affected despite the major findings that were made and the reported clinical and PK data of 
the inspected trial ETA.50/334 are considered to be of sufficient quality to be used for the evaluation of 
the MAA.  
The study was a single dose, PK and safety study conducted in Jordan in healthy volunteers (n=52) 
comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel EU-sourced. 
Healthy subjects are considered an adequate, most homogenous, population when conducting a 
comparative PK study in the context of a biosimilar MAA. The analytical method is considered validated 
in line with the relevant guidelines. 
Design, selected dose and sample size were considered adequate to evaluate PK-bioequivalence 
between Nepexto and Enbrel. The test product was representative of the to-be commercialised finished 
product. 
The results of the primary endpoints, i.e. 90%CI for the ratio on Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ falling within 
the acceptance range of 80.00%-125.00%, showed bioequivalence between Nepexto and Etanercept. 
Five study subjects were excluded from the statistical analysis in the comparison between Nepexto and 
EU sourced Enbrel due to carry-over effect. This exclusion did not have a relevant impact on the 
outcome of the study, point estimators remained close to 1 with 90% confidence intervals contained 
within the 80-125% acceptance range (Cmax 101.18 [92.23-110.99], AUC0-t 96.22 [88.92-104.12], 
AUC0-∞ 95.56 [88.37-103.32]). 
Two other phase I studies (LBC-14-155 and YLB113-001) were initially carried out to demonstrate 
biosimilarity between Nepexto and Enbrel. In each study compliance with the 80-125% acceptance 
criteria could formally be shown for the primary PK parameters. However, these results could not be 
accepted as proof of biosimilarity due to the following reasons.  
Both studies used material from the active substance manufacturing process with lower amount of 
misfolds and sialic acid which is not representative of the intended commercialised product. 
Study LBC-14-155 was conducted at a CRO inspected in an Article 31 referral1,. The referral concluded 
that bioequivalence studies in which bioanalysis was carried at the CRO in the time span between June 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 38/84 
 
  
2012 and June 2016 cannot be accepted to support MAAs. Since Study LBC-14-155 was conducted in 
2014, the results could not be taken into account in support of the MAA for Nepexto.  
In Study YLB113-001, more than 50% of subjects in period II of the study had to be excluded due to 
potential carry-over effect. Reliable bioequivalence evaluation after exclusion of more than half of 
subjects is therefore questionable by CHMP. PK data obtained from study YLB113-001 were therefore 
not accepted by CHMP as proof for bioequivalence between the test and the reference product. 
No PK data were generated throughout the phase III in patients with RA. Hence, no multiple dose data 
are available for Nepexto. Similarity between the test and reference product in terms of attainment of 
steady state conditions and associated peak and trough levels after multiple dose administration 
cannot be evaluated. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The similarity of the PK profiles between Nepexto and Enbrel was demonstrated based on the results 
obtained from the most recently conducted BE study ETA.50/334. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies were performed, which is acceptable for a biosimilar product.  
The proposed dosing regimens for Nepexto are identical to those approved for Enbrel. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study YLB113-002 
Study YLB113-002 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group comparative study to 
assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nepexto and Enbrel for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).

• 
• 
• 
• 
other rheumatic diseases, autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, or immune 
deficiencies; 
active or prior history of malignancies within 5 years prior to Screening 
active or prior history of clinically significant or uncontrolled respiratory, hepatic, renal, 
hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic

history of any autoimmune disease or psychiatric illness; 
history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart association criteria Class III/ IV)  
serious systemic infections (positive serological test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C or had

Treatments 
Design / duration 
The biosimilar Nepexto (manufactured in Japan) was tested against EU-sourced Enbrel as active 
comparator for therapeutic equivalence in the clinical model of RA. 
The maximum duration of the study for each subject was up to 56 weeks, including treatment period 
of 52 weeks and follow-up period of 4 weeks or until the time of discontinuation from the study. 
According to the subject disposition scheme, 497 subjects completed Stage A (247 patients in Nepexto 
group and 250 patients in Enbrel group). These were distributed to either proceed to Stage B (n=471) 
or Stage C (n=18).

Stage A 
The first 24-weeks of this study was stage A. Eligible subjects were enrolled in stage A and randomly 
assigned to receive Nepexto 50 mg or Enbrel 50 mg once a week as a subcutaneous injection for 24 
weeks (on a background of stable dose of MTX). The first dose was administered on Day 1 (Week 0). 
After completion of Stage A, subjects could have continued either in stage B (same treatments as 
stage A) or stage C (crossover of treatments of stage A). Stage C ran in parallel to stage B and 
included those subjects who were eligible as per the eligibility criteria for stage C. Both the stage B and 
stage C were double-blind. 
Stage B 
All subjects who completed evaluations for Week 24 in stage A and were willing to continue in stage B, 
and tolerated the study medications administered in stage A with no serious adverse events (SAEs), or 
unresolved Grade 3 or higher AEs related to study medication were eligible to enter stage B. The 
subjects were administered the same drug as in stage A (Nepexto 50 mg or Enbrel 50 mg) once a 
week as a subcutaneous injection for 28 weeks in this multicentre, comparative study. 
The objective of stage B was to compare long-term safety, and immunogenicity of Nepexto and Enbrel. 
Stage C 
All subjects who demonstrated reduction in their baseline DAS28 score by ≥0.6 at Week 12 and/or 
Week 24 and completed the 24-week period of stage A, and tolerated the study medications 
administered in stage A with no SAEs or unresolved Grade 3 or higher AEs related to study medication 
were eligible to enter stage C. Eligible subjects crossed over to the other treatment arm (from Nepexto 
to Enbrel and Enbrel to Nepexto) and received subcutaneous injections once a week for 28 weeks. 
However, the subjects whose DAS28 score had either not improved or those who were more inclined to 
participate in Stage B (in spite of DAS28 improvement), continued in stage B. 
Stage C was not conducted in Japan but done in Europe and India as an amendment to the original 
protocol (Protocol Version 2.1).

Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ACR20 response rate at Week 24 of dosing in the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS) (The proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 of treatment 
compared with that prior to treatment [Baseline]). Subjects were considered to have achieved an 
ACR20 improvement if compared to Baseline (Day 1), they achieved a: 
•  20% decrease in Swollen Joint Count (SJC),  
•  20% decrease in Tender Joint Count (TJC) and  
•  20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 measures: 
•  Subject assessment of pain (visual analog scale [VAS]). 
•  Subject global assessment of disease activity (VAS). 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 42/84 
 
  
 
•  Physician global assessment of disease activity (VAS). 
•  C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 
•  Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
 
 
 
 
DAS28 Scores 
ACR20 response rate at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 of dosing; 
ACR50 response rate at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 of dosing; 
ACR70 response rate at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 of dosing; 
An improvement in the DAS28 response at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 of dosing. 
The DAS28 score was calculated using results from a 28-joint subset of the 66/68 SJC/TJC. The DAS28 
is a composite score (ranging from 0 to 9.4) calculated using the results of the 28-joint subset of the 
66/68 SJC/TJC, CRP levels (mg/L) or ESR levels (mm/hr), and the subject’s global assessment of 
diseases activity (0 to 100 scale).  
For each patient the acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) to be used throughout the study (for that 
specific patient) was recorded on the CRF at Screening. For patients for whom the CRP acute phase 
reactant was identified at screening, only CRP was used throughout the trial in the definition of ACR20 
(as well as in the definitions of ACR50 and ACR70). 
Sample size 
Assuming 70% response rate (ACR20) to treatment with Etanercept and MTX with an equivalence 
margin of 15% at a statistical significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, a sample size of 392 (196 
per treatment) was assumed to be required for equivalence testing. Approximately 500 patients were 
planned to be randomised for this study in consideration of dropouts and deviations. For determination 
of the equivalence margin, a meta-analysis of relevant studies was done as shown in Table 13.

Randomisation 
A total of 517 subjects (recruitment 50.3% Japan, 43.5% Europe, 6.2% India) with moderate to 
severe RA were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Nepexto 50 mg or Enbrel (“EU sourced”) 
once weekly for 52 weeks by subcutaneous injection. Treatment arm allocation was done by a central 
automatic system. Randomisation to treatment arms was stratified by age, disease activity and region. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. After the last subject completed the Week 24 visit (stage A), the study 
was unblinded for analysis of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity endpoints. All investigators and all 
patients were to remain blinded until the database was locked for Parts B and C. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects in the All Subjects Randomized Set (RND) set, who 
received at least one dose of study medication, regardless of actual treatment received. Randomised 
assignment to treatment groups was used for analysis. 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) included all subjects in the RND set who received at least one dose of study 
medication, had all efficacy measures necessary to calculate the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20) at 
Week 24 and complied with the requirements of the protocol / had no major protocol deviations. The 
primary efficacy analysis was the proportion of patients who achieve an ACR20 response at Week 24 
compared to baseline and was primarily based on the full analysis set (FAS).  
Statistical analysis and missing data handling 
The primary analysis was conducted applying binomial regression (using identity link function). Missing 
ACR20 data were imputed using a combination of non-responder imputation (NRI) and multiple 
imputation (MI) methods. The primary analysis was defined for FAS, however, in parallel, results were 
reported for the PP population. Equivalence was based upon the 95 % (2-sided) CI for the difference in

ACR20 response rates at week 24. If the 95 % CI is fully contained within equivalence range of -15 % 
to 15 %, equivalence is established. 
The primary analysis chosen is considered unusual for the analysis of a response endpoint (binary 
regression with identity link function allows estimation of proportions outside the 0% to 100% limits). 
Therefore, several sensitivity analyses (log-binomial regression, Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test, and 
logistic regression) were provided (also applying different missing data handling). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 528 subjects randomised before week 24, 497 completed stage A. These were distributed to 
either proceed to Stage B (n=471) or Stage C (n=18). 
Overall, early discontinuation was low during Stage A in both arms (Stage A completion: Nepexto 
92.9%, Enbrel 95.4%). Primary reason for early discontinuation was withdrawal by subject, these were 
more often related to AE in the Enbrel arm (Enbrel n=5; Nepexto n=2). Two subjects in the Enbrel arm 
discontinued due to administration site reactions and another two for rash / urticaria. No subject in the 
Nepexto arm discontinued for AEs related to administration site reactions. 
Subjects were given the choice after finalisation of Stage A to pursue either in Stage B or in parallel 
Stage C. However, entering Stage C was subject to fulfilling some criteria: Apart from good tolerability 
/ absence of SAE subjects had to present with a minimum treatment success (improvement in DAS28 
score ≥0.6 at week 12 and/or week 24) to be eligible for entering the “switching arm” Stage C. 
Irrespective of fulfilling these criteria subjects could independently decide not to proceed to switching 
medication (Stage C), but to remain on the treatment that they have already received during Stage A 
and enter Stage B for the remainder of the study. Only a very small number of subjects entered Stage 
C. Seven patients were excluded from the FAS/SAF due concerns of data integrity and GCP 
compliance. The applicant provided the results of the study by including these 7 subjects. The re-
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint including the seven subjects did not relevantly change the 
conclusions. The efficacy results are presented for the 517 subjects (excluding the 7 subjects).

Recruitment 
Study YLB113-002 was conducted from July 2015 to June 2017 in 101 centres across Europe (Spain, 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania), Ukraine, India and Japan.  
Conduct of the study 
With Protocol Amendment Version 2.0 (Dated 26 May 2016), the study objective was changed to 
include an additional objective for assessing the sustainability of efficacy of Enbrel and Nepexto after 
crossing over the treatments. For this purpose, stage C was added, which, however, was not to be 
conducted in Japan. 
Protocol Amendment Version 2.1 was implemented in all regions, except that stage C was not to be 
conducted in Japan. The target enrolled patient number since the competitive recruitment made it 
unlikely that the target number in each region would be as planned. The number of enrolled patients in 
Japan, EU and India was expected to be 500 with a competitive recruitment aiming to recruit 
approximately half the patients in Japan and half in Europe and India. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
The population of study YLB113-002 stage A (median age 54 years, 77.9% female) is considered 
representative for the general RA population. Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) of recruited 
subjects were similar across the arms. Due to high study completion rates the same applies to Stage 
B. Stage C was conducted in European sites only. 
A summary of key demographic characteristics (age, gender, region etc.) is presented in Table 14.

Baseline disease characteristics 
Baseline characteristics were overall comparable across the treatment arms. The CRP was selected as 
acute phase reactant for 191 (36.9%) subjects and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for 326 
(63.1%) subjects. The mean (±SD) baseline composite DAS28 score of investigator chosen patient 
specific acute phase reactant was 5.763 (±1.078): 5.756 (±1.111) in Nepexto arm and 5.771 
(±1.045) in Enbrel arm.  
Majority of subjects were having ACR global functional status of Class II (353 [68.3%]), followed by 
Class III (86 [16.6%]), and Class I (78 [15.1%]). The average dose of MTX at Baseline was 11.37 mg 
and 11.82 mg in Nepexto and Enbrel arms, respectively, which was within the allowable range 
specified in inclusion criteria.  
Overall, the recruited patient population of study YLB113-002 is considered adequate. 
The baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 15.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with an ACR20 response at Week 24. As specified in 
Statistical Analysis Plan, the primary analysis population is the full analysis set (FAS). For the primary 
analysis, missing ACR20 data were imputed using a combination of non-responder imputation (NRI) 
and multiple imputation (MI) methods.

The adjusted proportions of subjects with ACR20 response in each treatment group at Week 24 are estimated using binomial regression. 
The difference in proportions is calculated as the difference between the probabilities predicted by the model for both treatment groups on the 
original scale at Week 24 (E (response to treatment at Week 24) = treatment + Baseline DAS28 stratum + Age + Region). 
The 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference in proportions is produced using the binomial regression model. 
Missing data have been imputed according to NRI and/or MI. 
N = number of subjects in the analysis set with ACR20 results non-missing. 
Protocol defined margins: [-15.0%; +15.0%] for Week 24 95% confidence interval. 
One subject  has Day 1 pre-treatment missing components and thus, the baseline value is imputed using multiple imputation. 
The model estimate portion (NRI + MI) of subjects achieving ACR20 response was high in both arms, 
slightly higher for Enbrel (86.8%) as compared to the test medication (81.2%). The 95% CIs for the 
difference in portions (-5.6 [-11.6, 0.5]) were within the ±15% equivalence acceptance margin.  
The results obtained for the per protocol set (PPS) are more favourable than those found for the FAS. 
Equally, the difference in results (per treatment arm) between the two datasets is in the same order of 
magnitude (around 3-5% higher response rates in PPS as compared to FAS).

(-4.6 [-10.1, 0.8]). As could be expected for the PP population, response rates are higher as compared 
to the FAS (YLB113: 86.0 vs 81.2; Enbrel 90.6 vs 86.8).

Figure 7 ACR20 Response Over Time (Full Analysis Set) 
The time course of ACR20 response rates were very similar between the Nepexto (YLB113) and the 
Enbrel treatment arm from the first efficacy assessment at week 4 until the end of Stage A after 24 
weeks. In both treatment arms response rates are above 50% at the earliest assessment time point 
and are maintained slightly increasing until the end of Stage A.

Secondary endpoints 
ACR20 at early time points 
At early time points (week 4, 8, 12) equivalent efficacy in terms of ACR20 response was observed 
between the test product and Enbrel. In both treatment arms response rates increase with time (week 
4: 55.8-53.9; week 8: 67.5-74.0; week 12: 77.5-81.0). At all-time points, the 95% CIs for the model 
estimate in response rates is within the ±15% acceptance range. The same applies to the results for 
the PP population.

ACR50 
ACR50 response rates are lower in both treatment arms (as compared to ACR20). However, the 
portions of subjects achieving a 50% improvement in ACR are increasing over the 24-week Stage A 
treatment period. Apart from the assessment time point at 24 weeks, the 95% CIs for the estimate of 
portion difference between the arms are within the ±15% acceptance margin. Study YLB113-002 was 
not powered for ACR50 response rate comparison at single early time points. Very similar results were 
obtained for the PP population.

Baseline values for DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were between 5.2 and 6.1 across arms, hence, 
reflecting “very active” disease activity. The decrease in the DAS28 score was already -1.36 to -1.39 at 
the earliest assessment time point. Over the entire duration of Stage A DAS28 score improvements 
were clinically meaningful and very similar between the arms.

The DAS28 was calculated using specific formula depending on whether CRP or ESR was used for that 
particular patient (DAS28-CRP: in 38.8% of patients receiving Nepexto and 35% of patients receiving 
Enbrel or DAS28-ESR: in 61.2% in the Nepexto arm and 65% in the Enbrel arm). 
Similar improvements in DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR scores were achieved between the arms. 
Summary of main study 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Study identifier 
YLB113-002 
Design 
Pivotal ph.III study YLB113-002 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel 
group clinical equivalence study in 101 centers in Japan, India and 7 
European countries (BG, ES, CZ, HU, RO, LV, Ukraine). A total of n=517 
subjects (recruitment 50.3% Japan, 43.5% Europe, 6.2% India) with 
moderate to severe RA were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
Nepexto 50 mg or Enbrel (“EU sourced”) once weekly for 52 weeks by sc 
injection. Randomisation to treatment arms was stratified by age, disease 
activity and region as described above. 
Duration of main phase: 
After 28-day screening subjects were 
randomised to 24 weeks db main treatment 
for primary efficacy assessment Stage A; 
After unblinding for analysis of efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity, subjects proceed 
to either Stage B (28 weeks db receiving the 
same treatment as during Stage A) or Stage 
C (28 weeks db switching the medication 
previously received during Stage A). Stage C 
was not conducted in Japan and was offered 
only to those subjects achieving minimum 
treatment success (>0.6 DAS28) at either 
week 12 or 24 of Stage A and not presenting 
with SAE.

Descriptive statistics 
and estimate 
variability 
The primary analysis population is the FAS. Binomial regression (using 
identity link function) was used and missing ACR20 data were imputed using 
a combination of non-responder imputation (NRI) and multiple imputation 
(MI) methods. 
In parallel, results are reported for the PP population. Equivalence was 
based upon the 95 % (2-sided) CI for the difference in ACR20 response 
rates at wk 24. 
If the 95 % CI is fully contained within equivalence range of -15 % to 15 %, 
equivalence is established.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design 
The pivotal phase III study (YLB113-002) was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group 
comparative study to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nepexto and Enbrel for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 517 subjects (22.1% male, 77.9% female; 
recruitment 50.3% Japan, 43.5% Europe, 6.2% India) were randomised and included in the FAS in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either Nepexto (manufactured in Japan) 50 mg or Enbrel (“EU sourced”) once 
weekly for 52 weeks by subcutaneous injection. Randomisation to treatment arms was stratified by 
age, disease activity and region. The RA severity of included subjects was adequately reflected by their 
baseline disease characteristics. 
The choice of the clinical model of moderate to severe RA patients not adequately controlled with 
methotrexate is in line with the scientific advice given to the applicant in 2014 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/693250/2014) and in accordance with CHMP guidance (CPMP/EWP/556/95 Rev.2). 
This clinical model is considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of differences between 
the biosimilar candidate and the originator, as among the approved therapeutic indications of Enbrel, 
RA has been the most thoroughly studied. In addition, there are validated and reasonably sensitive 
methods to study the disease activity of RA which would therefore allow for the detection of any 
possible differences between the compared products.  
The general design of the study, the dosing regimen, the duration of the treatment (24 weeks Stage A, 
28 weeks safety / immunogenicity assessment, 4 weeks follow-up) are in line with EMA guideline 
recommendations on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of RA 
(CPMP/EWP/556/95 Rev.2) and are therefore acceptable by CHMP.  
The switching data obtained from stage C are considered supportive evidence for exchangeability as 
the study was not powered for the switching analysis.  
Study endpoints 
ACR20 response rate at week 24 as primary efficacy endpoint is representative of the clinical status in 
RA and is therefore acceptable by CHMP. As a multidimensional endpoint, the ACR response rate 
combines measuring objective clinical signs and symptoms (SJC, TJC, CRP or ESR), subjective 
measuring of the most debilitating key symptom pain [VAS] and subjective / objective global 
assessment of disease activity. Thus a wide range of RA clinical features is covered by the ACR 
response rate. 
Secondary endpoints like e.g. responder rates at earlier time points than 24 weeks (e.g. after 12 
weeks) and responder rates for improvements greater than 20% (ACR50, ACR70) in addition to the 
continuous endpoint DAS28 scores etc. were also assessed. Thereby, the choice of the secondary 
endpoints including DAS28 scores, continuous endpoint, is considered adequate by CHMP.  
For each patient, the acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) to be used throughout the study (for that 
specific patient) was recorded on the CRF at screening. For patients for whom the CRP acute phase 
reactant was identified at screening, only CRP was used throughout the trial in the definition of ACR20 
(as well as in the definitions of ACR50 and ACR70). The decision to follow up a patient either for CRP or 
ESR for the remainder of the study (as ACR and DAS component) was within the responsibility of the 
investigator according to the preference of each rheumatology centre. The approach is agreed by 
CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 60/84 
 
  
Equivalence margin 
The sample size was calculated assuming 70% response rate (ACR20) to treatment with Etanercept 
and MTX with an equivalence margin of 15% at a statistical significance level of 5% and a power of 
80%. The equivalence margin was defined based on a meta-analysis of three historical Enbrel studies. 
The random-effects meta-analysis of these 3 studies estimated a risk difference of 40.4% with a 95% 
CI of (31%, 50%). To preserve at least 50% of the effect of Enbrel over and above placebo, an 
equivalence limit of 15% was used for the primary analysis. This is considered adequate by CHMP. 
GCP inspection 
A routine GCP inspection was carried out at two clinical sites of the phase III study (YLB113-002) 
following a request from the CHMP, dated 28 June 2018, in connection with the evaluation of the MAA 
for Nepexto. No critical findings were found but some major and minor findings were observed. The 
observations, which were considered to be in the responsibility of the investigator sites are sites 
specific and are unlikely to affect the validity of the data. Overall, no violations to GCP compliance 
were detected that would question validity of data obtained from the pivotal study YLB113-002. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Therapeutic equivalence 
The pivotal trial has demonstrated comparable efficacy of Nepexto and the reference product Enbrel in 
terms of proportion of ACR20 responders at week 24. 
The model estimate portion (NRI + MI) of subjects achieving ACR20 response was high in both arms, 
slightly higher for Enbrel (86.8%) as compared to the test medication (81.2%). The 95% CIs for the 
difference in portions (-5.6 [-11.6, 0.5]) were within the ±15% equivalence acceptance margin. 
Response rates for ACR20 at week 24 observed in study YLB113-002 are in the same order of 
magnitude (however, about 5-10% higher) as observed in preceding etanercept biosimilar MAAs for 
which the RA treatment setting was chosen to demonstrate equivalence.  
For the primary analysis, missing ACR20 data were imputed using a combination of non-responder 
imputation (NRI) and multiple imputation (MI) methods. Additional sensitivity analyses were provided 
for the primary endpoint and support the results of the primary analysis.  
In line with results obtained for the primary endpoint, similar efficacy outcomes between the arms 
were also observed for secondary endpoints. The time course of ACR20 response rates was similar 
between the Nepexto and the Enbrel treatment arm from the first efficacy assessment at week 4 till 
the end of stage A after 24 weeks. In both treatment arms, response rates are above 50% at the 
earliest assessment time point and are maintained and slightly increasing for the remainder of stage A. 
At each early time points (week 4, 8. 12) the 95% CIs for the model estimate in response rates were 
within the ±15% acceptance range.  
Broken down to the single ACR parameters (SWJ, TJC, Pain, Patient Global Assessment of Disease 
Activity, Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire, ESR and 
CRP as acute phase reactants), the summarised percent changes in ACR-N were similar between the 
treatment arms. 
Extrapolation to other indications 
A single study in RA was performed. According to the EMA guidelines on biosimilarity, extrapolation to 
other indications may be accepted based on the total package of quality, pre-clinical, PK and clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 61/84 
 
  
evidence. Extrapolation to other authorised indications of Enbrel is considered justified, since all 
conditions for which Enbrel is approved are characterised by increased levels of TNFα as prominent 
inflammatory mediator forming the necessary elements in the chain of pathophysiological events. 
Elevated levels of TNFα are found in the serum and synovium in the diverse arthritis indications and in 
RA. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNFα-binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby 
inhibits the biological activity of TNFα. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Equivalence regarding efficacy has been shown in a RA model. The results obtained for the primary 
efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response rate at week 24) and secondary efficacy measures (ACR20 at 
earlier time points, ACR50/70 response rates, and continuous DAS28 scores) show equivalence 
between Nepexto and the reference product Enbrel within the ±15% (for the 95% 2-sided CIs) 
equivalence margin.  
Based on the analytical, non-clinical and clinical similarity of Nepexto to Enbrel, extrapolation to the 
other indications of the reference product is accepted by CHMP. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data for Nepexto are available from three phase I PK study in healthy volunteers (YLB113-001, 
LBC14-155, ETA.50/334) and one pivotal phase III (YLB113-002) efficacy and safety trial in RA 
patients. Overall, over 690 subjects/patients have been exposed to etanercept, as single (n=169) or 
multiple (n=524) doses. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure in healthy volunteers: 
In the (cross-over) PK studies, 169 healthy male volunteers were exposed to a single dose of Nepexto. 
In the Japanese phase I study YLB113-001, a single dose of 25 mg was used in 60 subjects whereas in 
the supportive Indian phase I study LBC14-155, a single dose of 50 mg was administered to 58 
subjects. In the pivotal Jordanian phase I study ETA.50/334, a single dose of 50 mg was used in 51 
subjects. 
Exposure in patients with moderate to severe RA: 
In the pivotal study YB113-002, a dose of 50 mg was administered once a week together with MTX. 
The safety population included all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of trial 
medication (n= 264 for Nepexto and n = 260 for Enbrel). 
Treatment period A (first 24 weeks of treatment, efficacy and safety) was completed by 248 (93.9%) 
of the Nepexto patients and by 248 (95.4%) of the Enbrel patients. The total exposure for a single 
patient was 24 doses equivalent to 24 weeks of treatment.  
Treatment period B (long-term safety over 52 weeks and immunogenicity) was completed by 226 
(95.8%) of the Nepexto patients and by 229 (97.4%) of the Enbrel patients. The total exposure for a 
single patient was 52 doses equivalent to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Treatment period C (cross-over treatment) was entered by additional 10 Nepexto patients and 8 Enbrel 
patients, of whom 9 (90%) and 8 (100%) completed the 52-week treatment.

Adverse events 
Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers:  
Study YLB113-001  
In this study, a total of 10.2% of subjects in the Nepexto group experienced an adverse event (AE) 
compared to 20% in the Enbrel group. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate and all were known from 
Enbrel. Infections and infestations were seen at a higher frequency in the Enbrel group compared to 
Nepexto group (6.7% vs 0%). 
Study LBC14-155 
A total of 14 AEs was seen of which 3 AEs occurred during the study and 11 during post study 
evaluation. All were mild or moderate, unexpected and unlikely related to the investigational product.  
Study ETA.50/334 
Fifty one (51) subjects were dosed in period I whereas 43 subjects were dosed in period II. A total of 
47 subjects received Nepexto (treatment A) and 47 subjects received EU-sourced Enbrel (treatment 
B). During the study, 53 adverse events were reported in 24 of the study subjects (47.06 %). At least 
one TEAE was experienced by 14 subjects (out of 47 subjects, 29.79%) after administration of 
Nepexto and by 16 subjects (out of 47 subjects, 34.04%) after administration of reference product, 
Enbrel. None of these AEs was serious and there were no AEs that resulted in any subject’s death, or 
the occurrence of any other significant event. 
Conclusion 
In the three studies, the safety profile was similar between both products. No deaths or serious 
adverse events (SAEs) were reported. There were no clinically significant differences in the occurrence 
of AEs in healthy volunteers between Nepexto and Enbrel.  
Phase 3 Study in RA patients: 
YLB113-002 – Stage A 
In the Nepexto group, 22.0% of the patients reported an AE related to the study drug whereas 35.8% 
of patients reported the respective drug-related AEs in the Enbrel group.  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) as reported in this study Stage A were significantly higher 
in the Enbrel group compared to the Nepexto group, 65.4% vs 55.3%. Of all patients with reported 
TEAEs, the majority of the events were mild (33.7% for Nepexto and 37.3% for Enbrel) to moderate 
(18.6% for Nepexto and 26.2% for Enbrel). 
In total, 3.0% of the patients in the Nepexto group and 1.9% of the patients in the Enbrel group 
showed a severe outcome of their TEAE.

The main TEAE by preferred term (PT) reported for infections and infestations was nasopharyngitis 
including 11.4% of the patients in the Nepexto group and 10.0% in the Enbrel group. For general 
disorders and administration site conditions, the main AEs were injection site erythema and injection 
site reaction, 1.9% vs 9.6%, and 3.8% vs 13.5% for Nepexto and Enbrel, respectively. 
YLB113-002 – Stage B and C 
For Stage B, 52.5% of the patients in the Nepexto group reported at least one TEAE, whereas the 
respective percentage was 62.1% in the Enbrel group. This is similar to Stage A Drug related AEs were 
reported for 11.9% in the Nepexto group compared to 26.4% in the Enbrel group.

Most TEAEs assessed as related or possibly related to study medication were mild in severity and 
resolved. The most frequently reported TEAE considered related to trial medication classified by SOC 
was general disorders and administration site conditions, and infections and infestations.  
In Stage C, 3 patients experienced a TEAE in both groups, 1 patient in the Nepexto compared to 2 
patients in the Enbrel group with a TEAE possibly related to the study drug.  
Most TEAEs assessed as related or possibly related to study medication were mild in severity and 
resolved. The most frequently reported TEAE considered related to study medication by SOC was 
general disorders and administration site conditions observed in 12.5% subjects in the Enbrel arm.

Similar to Stage A, in Stage B the main AE by PT reported for infections and infestations was 
nasopharyngitis in 14.8% of the patients in the Nepexto group and 18.7% in the Enbrel group. 
Injection site reactions occurred also more often in the Enbrel group (1,3 vs 7.2%). 
In both groups of Stage C, there was one patient with blood and lymphatic system disorder 
(neutropenia, neutropenia and leukopenia). 
Overall, the data suggest that Nepexto showed a similar AE profile as Enbrel. No new safety signal was 
derived from the presented data. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers:  
None related to study drug. 
Phase 3 Study in RA patients: 
Stage A 
The percentage of number of SAEs reported in the Nepexto group was 3.0% compared to 1.5 % of the 
SAEs reported in the Enbrel group. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the SAEs 
between groups in Stage A.  
In the Nepexto group, 4 patients (1.5%) have been reported with a serious TEAE related to the study 
drug compared to 1 patient (0.4%) in the Enbrel group. These were one urinary tract infection, 3 cases 
of pneumonia (one in the Enbrel group) and Still’s disease adult onset. All patients recovered. 
There was no AE reported leading to death. 
Stage B 
The proportion of patients reporting a SAE was 3.4% in the Nepexto group compared to 2.1 % in the 
Enbrel group in Stage B. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the SAEs between 
groups in Stage B.

In the Nepexto group, 4 patients (1.7%) were reported with a serious TEAE which was related to the 
study drug compared to 1 patient (0.4%) in the Enbrel group. These were one interstitial lung disease, 
one pneumoniae, rhinitis, sinusitis, pleural cyst (Nepexto group) and one Herpes zoster (Enbrel group). 
All patients recovered. 
There was no AE reported leading to death. 
Stage C 
No SAEs, premature study discontinuation or death were reported.   
In summary, the occurrence of SAEs was low (<5%) and no clinically meaningful differences were 
observed in the SAEs between the treatment groups in the different treatment periods.  
Immunological events 
During the Phase 1 trial YLB113-001, no ADA were detected. No detection of antibodies was performed 
in the Phase 1 trial LBC-14-155. 
During the pivotal efficacy trial YLB113-002 in patients with RA, samples for detection of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) were taken at baseline and at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 44 and 52. Immunogenicity was 
assessed using a validated and highly sensitive MDS electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) method. 
Neutralising ADAs (nAB) were evaluated for samples testing positive in the confirmatory ADA assay. 
At week 24, 2 patients in the Nepexto group showed positive ADAs, but no neutralising anti-Etanercept 
antibody. In the Enbrel group, 2 cases with a neutralising potential out of 21 positive ADAs were 
detected. 
As regards to the long-term immunogenicity outcome, in Stage B and C of the study, no ADAs were 
detected in the Nepexto group, while 3 patients in the Enbrel group had positive ADAs (without 
neutralising potential) in Stage B and 1 in Stage C. 
In summary, occurrence of ADAs was low and transient and without neutralising capacity in the 
Nepexto group. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory values were assessed by the Investigator and abnormalities considered to be clinically 
significant were reported as AEs. There were 29 patients in the Nepexto group for whom an alteration 
in at least one laboratory value has been reported compared to 21 patients with at least one TEAEs 
based on a laboratory value in the Enbrel group.  
Fifteen patients of the Nepexto group were reported with increased liver enzyme values including 
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol and triglyceride 
parameters, mostly of mild grade. One severe and one moderate graded events were reported as 
unlikely related to the study drug. In the Enbrel group, 17 patients have been reported with increased 
liver enzymes, one severe and 8 moderate. In one case, the causality was judged as related to the 
study drug intake. To treat these events, the MTX dose was decreased or temporarily stopped as such 
an increase in liver enzymes is well described for MTX as cDMARD to treat patients with RA. 
Besides increase in liver enzymes, alterations in haematological laboratory values have been described 
in both treatment groups, recovering in most of the cases. None of the described alterations in 
laboratory values were reported as AESI. 
No clinically important treatment group difference was noted in the mean change from baseline for any 
haematology, biochemistry and urine analysis parameter.

No drug-related clinically relevant abnormalities were observed regarding clinical laboratory evaluation, 
vital signs and physical examination. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety profile for special populations has been described for the originator Enbrel and does not 
have to be established for the biosimilar candidate if similarity can be shown in a sensitive study 
population. 
The phase III trial YLB113-002 was performed in Europe, Japan, Ukraine and India. Of note, the 
percentage of patients with at least one TEAE were 30.2% for Nepexto and 46.8% for Enbrel in Europe 
compared to 80.9% for Nepexto and 84.5% for Enbrel in Japan.  
The frequency of TEAEs were comparable between males and females in the phase III trial YLB113-
002. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Stage A 
Two patients in the Nepexto group and 5 patients in the Enbrel group experienced AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. Two patients in the Nepexto group experienced a SAE with a severe 
grade leading to the discontinuation of the administration of the study drug (Still’s disease adult onset 
- possibly related, Lobular breast carcinoma in situ - unlikely related). In the Enbrel group all AEs 
leading to discontinuation were non-serious and of mild to moderate intensity. 
Stage B 
Four cases in the Nepexto group and 4 cases in the Enbrel group led to study drug discontinuation. 
There were 2 SAEs in the Nepexto group (Interstitial lung disease – possibly related, Pancreatic 
carcinoma with metastasis – unlikely related) that led to study drug discontinuation and 2 SAEs in the 
Enbrel group (Renal abscess and uterine cancer – both not related).  
Stage C - No discontinuation of study medication was reported. 
In summary, the overall occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study 
discontinuation was low and comparable in the Nepexto and Enbrel groups. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The active substance etanercept has been widely used in clinical practice for approximately 15 years 
with a well-known safety profile. The main safety issues are related to the immunosuppressive 
properties of etanercept.  
The pharmacology of Nepexto has been investigated in three phase I clinical studies (YLB113-001, 
LBC-14-155 and ETA.50/334), comparing its pharmacokinetics and safety after single subcutaneous 
application with the reference product Enbrel. As the single dose administration of these trials does not 
reflect the clinical situation of multiple dose administration, the impact of the derived safety data is 
considered limited by CHMP. Furthermore, an accurate attribution of AEs to either treatment is 
uncertain in a cross-over design. Overall, the safety profile was similar between Nepexto and Enbrel in 
these studies. 
In the pivotal study YB113-002, a dose of 50 mg/mL of Nepexto was administered once a week 
together with MTX in patients with moderate to severe RA. The SAF population included those patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 68/84 
 
  
who received 1 or more doses of Nepexto (n = 264) or Enbrel (n = 260) as study medication. Overall, 
the extent of exposure is considered similar between treatment groups. 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in stage A were higher in the Enbrel group compared to 
Nepexto group (65.4% vs 55.3%), also those related to study drug were higher in the Enbrel group 
(35.8 vs 22.0%). The majority of TEAEs was mild or moderate in severity in both treatment groups. 
The results in stage B were similar.  
For both treatment groups in stage A, TEAEs were reported most frequently for the SOC Infections and 
infestations (Nepexto 23.9% vs Enbrel 27.7%) and General disorders and administration site 
conditions (11% vs 30.8). The most commonly reported PTs for infections and infestations were 
nasopharyngitis (11.4% vs 10.0%), injection site erythema (1.9% vs 9.6%) and injection site reaction 
(3.8% vs 13.5%). Similar results were obtained in Stage B. 
The relatively lower incidence of injection site reactions with Nepexto compared to Enbrel is in 
alignment with results of other biosimilar trials. No apparent correlation between ADA and injection site 
reactions could be demonstrated. A plausible immunological explanation may not pertain to ADA but to 
latex allergy/hypersensitivity reactions. Enbrel is available in the form of vials, pre-filled syringes and 
auto-injectors. The needle cover of the prefilled syringe as well as the needle cover within the cap of 
the auto-injector contain dry natural rubber, which is a derivative of latex. The applicant considers that 
the lower injection site reactions can be explained by the absence of latex from needle shield of 
Nepexto.  The explanation is agreed by CHMP. 
Some differences in the TEAES profile between the three Phase I and the Phase III studies were 
observed, which might be attributed to a different potential for developing or reporting AEs among the 
studied populations (ethnicity). Participants in each Phase I study were of ethnic homogeneity 
(Japanese, Indian or Jordanian) while YB113-002 was conducted in Japan, India, Ukraine and Europe. 
The percentage of patients with at least one TEAE was much lower in Europe (30.2% for Nepexto and 
46.8% for Enbrel) than in Japan (80.9% and 84.5%). The Applicant outlined several possible reasons 
for the higher reporting of AEs in the Japanese population. Ethnic differences may be explained by 
lower body weight compared to European RA patients. There is evidence that on an average, Japanese 
patients report generally more adverse events than patients from Europe and especially in rheumatoid 
arthritis clinical trials. The issue was not further pursued since the observations are comparable 
between Nepexto and the reference product Enbrel. 
The frequency of TEAEs were comparable between males and females in the Phase III trial YLB113-
002. 
No SAEs related to study drug were reported for the Phase I trials. In study YLB113-002, overall, SAEs 
were observed by 3.0% of the patients in the Nepexto group and 1.5% in the Enbrel group of which 
drug related SAEs were reported respectively by 1.5 and 0.4% of the patients. It is therefore 
considered by CHMP there are no clinically meaningful differences in the SAEs between the treatment 
groups in the different treatment periods.  
No clinically important treatment group difference was noted in the mean change from baseline for any 
hematology, biochemistry and urine analysis parameter and no drug-related clinically relevant 
abnormalities were observed regarding clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs and physical 
examination. 
The overall occurrence of TEAEs leading to study discontinuation was comparable in the Nepexto and 
Enbrel groups. 
The safety profile as reflected by nature and severity of detected adverse events indicates similarity 
between Nepexto and Enbrel. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 69/84 
 
  
The lower ADA formation and lower rate of local skin reactions reported for Nepexto compared to 
Enbrel suggest that Nepexto is less immunogenic than Enbrel. Reduced immunogenicity on itself is not 
considered a risk from a clinical perspective, and the small difference did not have a clinical impact and 
as such did not preclude biosimilarity. These findings were also reported for other biosimilar products 
to Enbrel. 
The incidence and severity of reported TEAEs in the submitted trials did not suggest any major safety 
concerns. The profile of the adverse reactions are known as indicated in the SmPC of Enbrel and its 
subsequent recovery was confirmed.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Nepexto and Enbrel appear to be similar. The incidence and severity of reported 
TEAEs in the submitted trials are in accordance with the known safety profile of etanercept. The 
submitted safety data support the biosimilarity.

additional monitoring list as a new biological product.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Nepexto (etanercept) was developed as a biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Enbrel 
(etanercept).  
The applicant applied for the same therapeutic indications as for Enbrel: moderate to severe 
rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis), plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis.  
The indications (and where appropriate: posology instructions) and route of administration 
(subcutaneous use) proposed for Nepexto are identical to those of the reference product Enbrel. 
Nepexto is available as 25 mg pre-filled syringe, 50 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg in pre-filled pen. 
Thus, it is not possible to administer Nepexto to paediatric patients that require less than a full 25 mg 
or 50 mg dose. Paediatric patients who require a dose other than a full 25 mg or 50 mg should not 
receive Nepexto. If an alternate dose is required, other etanercept products offering such an option 
should be used. 
The claim of biosimilarity is based on analytical, non-clinical and clinical data. 
Quality 
To establish biosimilarity between Nepexto and the reference product Enbrel at quality level two 
biosimilarity studies were conducted; one was conducted during the developmental stage of Nepexto 
and one was conducted after Nepexto was available from the commercial manufacturing process.  
A varying number of Nepexto active substance and finished product batches were used in both studies. 
To increase representativeness of the commercial process and verify independence of Nepexto batches 
used an additional (third) biosimilarity study was conducted with up to 11 active substance batches of 
the post-process validation stage. 
Non-clinical data 
The non-clinical programme comprised comparative in vitro binding studies and functional assays, 
comparative in vivo pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies and non-comparative toxicity 
studies conducted with Nepexto alone. 
The large amount of in vivo animal data submitted, both from comparative and non-comparative 
studies and with different reference medicinal products was not required in the frame a comparability 
exercise for an EU biosimilar as per scientific advice given (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/693250/2014) and EMA 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). Since the studies had already been conducted at the 
request of non-EU regulatory authorities, they were submitted as supportive information. 
The in vivo pharmacology study was examined in a mouse model of collagen induced arthritis. The PK 
profile of Nepexto was investigated and compared with Enbrel in one single dose comparative 
pharmacokinetic study in Swiss albino mice and in a 4-week repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic 
study in Cynomolgus monkeys. The studies conducted mouse model of collagen induced arthritis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 77/84 
 
  
in Swiss albino mice were only considered as a supportive study for the EU MAA as the comparator 
Enbrel used in was sourced from India, not an ICH country, therefore not meeting the requirements of 
the Guideline on similar medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1). 
Clinical data 
Demonstration of clinical equivalence is based on: 
•  Study ETA.50/334: single dose, PK and safety study conducted in Jordan in healthy 
volunteers (n=52) comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel EU-source 
•  Study YLB113-002: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group comparative 
study to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nepexto and Enbrel for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 2014, scientific advice was provided to the applicant 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/693250/2014) and the clinical model of moderate to severe RA was 
confirmed as sensitive and suitable to demonstrate biosimilarity between the test and 
reference medicinal product, Enbrel. The overall design and conduct of the study is in line with 
relevant EMA guidelines (CHMP/437/04 Rev.1; CPMP/EWP/556/95 Rev.2; 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Two other single dose phase I PK-safety studies, one in India (LBC-14-155), one in Japan (YLB113-
001), were conducted in healthy volunteers comparing Nepexto versus Enbrel and could not be 
accepted as a proof of similarity between Nepexto and Enbrel since these studies were performed using 
material from the manufacturing process containing lower amounts of misfolded forms and sialic acids 
per molecule etanercept as compared the material to be commercialised. Thus, the product used in 
these phase I studies cannot be considered representative of the proposed commercial product. In 
addition, study LBC-14-155 was conducted at the contract research organisation (CRO) whereas an 
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC referral procedure1 concluded that data from studies conducted at 
the sites between June 2012 and June 2016 are unreliable and cannot be accepted as a basis for MA in 
the EU. Since Study LBC-14-155 was conducted during that time frame, the results cannot be taken 
into a consideration in this application.  
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
With respect to primary, secondary and higher order structure, comparability of Nepexto with the 
reference product Enbrel EU has been confirmed. Similar purity was demonstrated with respect to 
oxidised and deamidated variants; a lower level of N- and C-terminal variants was observed for 
Nepexto. 
Analytical similarity of Enbrel sourced from EU and Japan was established and further supported with 
additional lots of Enbrel from Japan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 78/84 
 
  
 
 
Non clinical 
In the comparative in vitro studies, including the evaluation of TNF receptor related biological activities 
and Fc related binding characteristics, similarity between Nepexto and Enbrel was demonstrated.  
Similar efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics profiles were seen in a 4-week repeat dose toxicity and 
toxicokinetic study in Cynomolgus monkeys between the test and the reference product. 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
The phase I study ETA.50/334 was conducted at the clinical site using a test product batch that is 
representative of Nepexto product to be commercialised and EU-sourced Enbrel as reference product. 
The results showed that the primary PK parameters AUC0-t and Cmax fall within the acceptance range of 
80.00%-125.00% (90%CI). Point estimators were close to 1 and 90% CIs include 100% (ratios AUCt 
96.22 [88.92-104.12], Cmax 101.18 [92.23-110.99]). The study met the bioequivalence criteria and 
support biosimilarity. 
Efficacy 
Comparative efficacy data were obtained from the phase III study YLB113-002, designed as a 
randomised double-blind parallel group study to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy and safety 
between the biosimilar test product Nepexto and the Enbrel reference in patients with moderate to 
severe RA when co-administered with MTX (6 to 25 mg/week). The RA severity of included subjects 
was adequately reflected by their baseline disease characteristics. Study discontinuation was low. More 
than 96% (497/517) of randomised subjects completed stage A. Only minor disparities were observed 
for subjects discontinuing during stage A (Nepexto: n=17 [6.4%], Enbrel: n=10 [3.8%]). 
In terms of the ACR20 primary endpoint, the model estimate portion (NRI + MI) of subjects achieving 
ACR20 response was high in both arms, slightly higher for Enbrel (86.8%) as compared to the test 
medication (81.2%). However, the 95% CIs for the difference in portions (-5.6 [-11.6, 0.5]) were 
within the pre-specified ±15% equivalence acceptance margin. 
In line with results obtained for the primary endpoint, similar efficacy outcomes between the arms 
were also observed for secondary endpoints. The time course of ACR20 response rates was very 
similar between the Nepexto and the Enbrel treatment arm from the first efficacy assessment at week 
4 until the end of stage A after 24 weeks. In both treatment arms response rates are above 50% at 
the earliest assessment time point and are maintained and slightly increasing for the remainder of 
stage A. At each early time points (week 4, 8. 12) the 95% CIs for the model estimate in response 
rates were within the ±15% acceptance range.  
Broken down to the single ACR parameters (SWJ, TJC, Pain, Patient Global Assessment of Disease 
Activity, Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire, ESR and 
CRP as acute phase reactants), the summarised percent changes in ACR-N were similar between 
treatment arms.  
Overall, the results obtained for the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response rate at week 24) and 
secondary efficacy measures (ACR20 at earlier time points, ACR50/70 response rates, and continuous 
DAS28 scores) point to equivalence between the test and the reference product within the ±15% (for 
the 95% 2-sided CIs) equivalence margin.  
Clinical safety 
The number and nature of adverse events were generally comparable between Nepexto and Enbrel 
with a lower incidence of ADAs and local skin reactions for Nepexto indicating possibly a lower 
immunogenic potential. This however, does not preclude a conclusion of biosimilarity since reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 79/84 
 
  
immunogenicity is not considered a risk from a clinical perspective, and the small difference did not 
have a clinical impact.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality & non-clinical 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity. 
Clinical 
Out of the three single dose phase I PK studies submitted by the applicant to demonstrate biosimilarity 
between Nepexto and the reference product Enbrel, only one study (ETA.50/334) could be accepted as 
proof of biosimilarity. 
The study YLB113-001 initially designated as the pivotal PK study did not allow reliable conclusion of 
biosimilarity due to objections relating to carry-over effects in combination with concerns regarding the 
representativeness of the test product used during PK study programme for the product intended to be 
marketed (see section 2.4.2. ).  
The study LBC-14-155 was conducted at a CRO part of an article 31 referral which concluded that data 
from studies conducted at this CRO between June 2012 and June 2016 are unreliable and cannot be 
accepted as a basis for MA in the EU. Since study LBC-14-155 was conducted during that time frame, 
the results cannot be taken into a consideration in this application (see section 2.4.2. ). 
Due to the shortcomings in the two PK studies described above, the applicant conducted a third PK 
study during the clock stop period.  
In this study, as for in study YLB113-001, relevant pre-administration etanercept dose levels were 
observed in five subjects before the start of period II. Given the 75 ng/mL LLoQ, individual plasma 
profiles are eligible for statistical analysis if the Cmax of the respective subject was > 1500 ng/mL, since 
pre-administration concentrations must not exceed 5% of individual Cmax. Actual Cmax values for five 
subjects were so low that a LLoQ of 75 ng/mL could not be accepted for these subjects as carry over 
effects cannot be excluded. A revised PK analysis was submitted excluding the respective subjects. 
Exclusion of the five subjects did not have a relevant impact on the outcome of the study, point 
estimators remained close to 1 with 90% confidence intervals contained within the 80-125% 
acceptance range. 
Upon request by CHMP, a triggered GCP inspection was conducted at the clinical and analytical sites of 
study ETA.50/334 to verify the newly submitted PK data. The major findings observed at these two 
sites were considered system-related and could therefore potentially have an impact on the quality of 
all study data. However, the inspections at both sites concluded that overall reliability of the data is not 
affected despite the major findings that were made. 
The above uncertainties and limitations have been addressed by the newly PK study and the findings of 
the GCP inspection.  
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations concerning the safety profile of the test product. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
With a new comparability study based on up to eleven batches of Nepexto, a representative data pool 
is available for similarity assessment with the reference product and the initially raised major objection 
on the analytical biosimilarity claim is resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212524/2020 
Page 80/84 
 
  
Results obtained from the new biosimilarity study confirmed results obtained from the previous 
biosimilarity studies that had limited representativeness. 
Differences in the N-glycosylation profile further exist while differences in the site occupancy profile of 
O-glycans turned out to be method-related and thus structurally irrelevant. The differences in N-glycan 
profile affect the ADCC. Several biological assays were performed with a representative number of 
batches (TNF-α and TNF- α neutralisation assay, apoptosis bioassay, ADCC, CDC). The methods used 
to investigate the product related variants aggregates, HMW species and LMW species (SE-HPLC) as 
well as misfolded species and degradants (HI-HPLC) were improved and therefore results reflect a 
similar or slightly better purity profile of Nepexto. 
A lower level of C-terminal variants with lysine affected the charge profile; however, this is of no 
concern for the functionality of the molecule. 
The claim of analytical biosimilarity is supported based on the results of the additional comparability 
study performed with a representative number of batches and using suitable analytical methods. 
In addition, clinical PK data obtained from the pivotal study ETA 50/334 demonstrate similarity 
between the test Nepexto and the reference Enbrel product, based on point estimators for etanercept 
exposure after SD administration of 50 mg solution for injection in PFS (Cmax 101.18 [92.23-110.99], 
AUC0-t 96.22 [88.92-104.12], AUC0-∞ 95.56 [88.37-103.32]). Efficacy and safety data obtained from 
phase III trial YLB113-002 in patients with moderate to severe RA demonstrated biosimilarity between 
the test and reference product.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The number and nature of adverse events were generally comparable between Nepexto and Enbrel 
with a lower incidence of local skin reactions for Nepexto indicating possibly a lower immunogenic 
potential. This, however, is not regarded to have an impact on the assessment of biosimilarity since 
reduced immunogenicity is not considered a risk from a clinical perspective, and the small difference 
did not have a clinical impact. 
The clinical model of moderate to severe RA was chosen to demonstrate similar efficacy between the 
test and the reference medicinal product. Moderate to severe RA was confirmed as a sensitive and 
suitable clinical setting in the preceding scientific advice procedure and in line with applicable 
Guidelines. In view of reported baseline data in terms of Swollen Joint Count, Tender Joint Count, 
DAS28 Score and acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP) the chosen patient population is considered 
representative of the intended population and suitable for the efficacy comparison between the test 
and reference product.  
According to the overarching guideline on similar biological medicinal products, extrapolation to other 
indications of the reference medicinal product could be acceptable, provided that biosimilarity has been 
demonstrated in one indication. Extrapolation to other authorised indications of Enbrel is considered 
justified, since all conditions for which Enbrel is approved are characterised by increased levels of TNFα 
as prominent inflammatory mediator forming the necessary elements in the chain of pathophysiological 
events. Elevated levels of TNFα are found in the serum and synovium in the diverse arthritis indications 
and in RA. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNFα-binding to its cell surface receptors, and 
thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNFα. 
Based on the available data, the extrapolation of efficacy and safety profile of Enbrel in RA patients to 
other indications is considered acceptable.

3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Nepexto is considered biosimilar to Enbrel. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nepexto is favourable in the following indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Nepexto in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Nepexto can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Nepexto is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in 
adults not previously treated with methotrexate. 
Nepexto, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression 
of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who 
have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Etanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral 
joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease.

Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or 
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who 
are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Jinarc. The RMP details 
important risks of Jinarc, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about tolvaptan's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Jinarc's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how this product should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Jinarc should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
tolvaptan’s RMP. 
I: The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Jinarc is authorised in the EEA under indication to slow the progression of cyst 
development and renal insufficiency of atuosomnal dominant polycyctic kidney disease 
(ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 4 at initiation of treatment with evidence of 
rapidly progressing disease (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains tolvaptan as the 
active substance and it is given by oral tablet administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Jinarc’s benefits can be found in Jinarc’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under 
the medicine’s webpage. 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/jinarc  
II: Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Jinarc, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about its risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, 
prescription only) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Jinarc, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, (including PSUR assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Jinarc is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A: A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Jinarc are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Jinarc. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B: Summary of Important Risks for Jinarc 
Table 0-1 
Important Identified Risk: Liver Injury in ADPKD Patients 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The risk of developing hepatotoxicity involves a complex 
interplay between the chemical properties of the drug, 
environmental factors (eg, the use of concomitant drugs or 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 0-1 
Important Identified Risk: Liver Injury in ADPKD Patients 
alcohol), age, sex, and underlying diseases. The most extensively 
documented risk factors are concomitant drug use and 
diseases.62,63 
The mechanisms underlying tolvaptan-induced liver injury 
cannot be determined based on the available data. However, the 
prolonged latency to onset and the relatively prompt recurrence 
upon re-challenge would support involvement of the adaptive 
immune system. Engagement of adaptive immunity could also 
potentially account for the progression and prolonged resolution 
phases characteristically observed after discontinuing tolvaptan 
treatment.61 
In view of the liver safety signal emerging from review of the 
ADPKD clinical trial database, liver safety data from the 
preapproval clinical trials for cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, 
and hyponatraemia were reviewed by the experts and no signal 
was found.61 
Risk factors and risk groups 
ADPKD 
The liver enzyme elevations seen with Jinarc characteristically 
had an onset between 3 and 18 month of treatment. The injury 
typically progressed by biochemical criteria for weeks after 
discontinuation of treatment, and resolved slowly over one to 
several months. HLA alleles have been identified as patient risk 
factors for liver injury due to certain drugs. If HLA alleles that 
infer risk for liver injury in tolvaptan treated patients are 
identified (ie, missing information), a personalized medicine 
approach to improve liver safety might be feasible.

Patients with an inability or a compromised capacity to perceive 
and communicate thirst would be at risk of severe dehydration 
without appropriate medical intervention. This would include 
bedridden and unconscious subjects. Patients who are 
concomitantly treated with diuretics may be at risk of severe 
dehydration and subsequent renal impairment. 
Special populations which may be at higher risk also include 
those with a fluid overload in extravascular compartments, but 
with intravascular contraction. These groups include subjects 
with hepatic cirrhosis, and potentially some subjects with heart 
failure.

Jinarc PASS: In the EU/EFTA 2,100 
patients who are treated according to the 
decision of the 
treating physician will be followed 
prospectively for a minimum of 2 years 
and a maximum of 5 years monitor the 
risk of liver injury in the real life setting. 
To compliment this prospective study, a 
large multi-national retrospective 
database 
analysis at predetermined periods 
postlicensing 
will allow monitoring of off label use. In 
addition, there will be an assessment of 
ADPKD related morbidity and mortality, 
ncluding 
longer-term effects on GFR decline and 
progression of disease leading to dialysis 
or trans-plantation. The objective of the 
PASS is to prospectively collect 
information on the safety of Jinarc when 
used in a real-life setting. A 
retrospective study to assess safety 
concerns associated with longer term use 
will also be included.

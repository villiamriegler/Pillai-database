2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Anidulafungin is intended to treat invasive candidiasis. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adults and paediatric patients aged 1 month to <18 years. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The overall incidence of candidemia in population-based studies ranges from 1 to 17.5 cases per 100,000 
persons [source: UpToDate]. Candidemia is the leading cause of invasive fungal infections in hospitalized 
children. Among the different populations of paediatric patients, the highest rates of candidemia have 
been recorded in neonates and infants <1 year of age. In a study from the United States, the annual 
incidence of candidemia in infants was 15.7 - 17.5 per 100,000 whilst the incidence in children aged 1 to 
19 years was 1 per 100,000 [J Paediatric Infect Dis Soc. 2018;7(3):e78]. Immunosuppressed children, 
children in intensive care units, children with central venous catheters, and neonates are most at risk for 
the development of candidemia. Risk factors include the presence of a central venous catheter, 
mechanical ventilation, damage to the intestinal mucosa, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, use of 
parenteral nutrition. 
Clinical presentation 
The clinical manifestations of candidemia and invasive candidiasis vary from minimal fever to a fulminant 
sepsis with multi-organ system failure that is indistinguishable from severe bacterial infection. 
Management 
Currently, the following antifungal agents have an indication of treatment of invasive candidiasis in 
children: caspofungin, micafungin, amphotericin B and fluconazole. Voriconazole is licensed for treatment 
of candidaemia in children aged 2 and older. 
According to the ESCMID guidelines [Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 Dec; 18 Suppl 7():38-52.], echinocandins 
(i.e. caspofungin with a loading dose of 70 mg/m2, followed by 50 mg/m2/day, 2-4 mg/kg/day 
micafungin) are the alternative agents for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in children. These 
guidelines also recommend anidulafungin with a loading dose of 3 mg/kg, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day. 
Note that caspofungin and micafungin are approved for paediatric patients, while anidulafungin is 
assigned for IC treatment in adult patients.  
Fluconazole is only recommended in non-neutropenic patients who are not critically ill and have no prior 
azole exposure. Triazoles should be considered for hemodynamically stable patients in institutions with a

low incidence of less susceptible Candida spp. Voriconazole is recommended for invasive candidiasis as it 
shows more potency than fluconazole, especially in infections caused by C. glabrata and C. krusei. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Anidulafungin (PF-03910960) is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity against Candida spp. 
Anidulafungin was approved in Europe on 20 September 2007 and, at the time of this variation 
application, it was indicated for the treatment of invasive candidiasis (IC) in adults, with a recommended 
dose of 100 mg daily following an initial LD of 200 mg. As of 31 December 2018, IV anidulafungin had 
been approved in 96 countries worldwide and was marketed in 81 countries. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No scientific advice has been given. 
A preliminary assessment of this study was performed during a recent art 46 procedure 
(EMA/H/000788/P46/046), which was also submitted as part of another post-authorisation measure 
(Follow Up Measure 021). At the time, the MAH indicated that a variation application consisting of the full 
relevant data package (i.e. containing PK/PD data from several studies) was to be submitted by 2019. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The key nonclinical data relevant to paediatric development are: 
•  Assessment of anidulafungin antifungal activity in the following nonclinical models thought to be 
relevant to the question of dosing in neonates: disseminated candidiasis in rabbits, hematogenous 
Candida meningoencephalitis (HCME) model in rabbits, and endophthalmitis model in rabbits. 
•  Single-dose exploratory and definitive repeat-dose toxicity studies with subcutaneous administration 
anidulafungin in neonatal and juvenile rats. 
•  A risk assessment of polysorbate 80 as an excipient in anidulafungin in the treatment of neonates. 
•  A literature search and review of published nonclinical safety information has also been conducted. 
Findings from all nonclinical studies were reviewed for their potential impact on patient safety. The 
safety and efficacy of anidulafungin are well documented in over 10 years of clinical use, and the 
newly-presented nonclinical studies do not affect the benefit: risk profile of anidulafungin for its 
indicated clinical use.

2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Disseminated candidiasis in rabbits (Petraitiene et al., 1999) 
This study evaluated the efficacy of anidulafungin (aka LY303366) compared to amphotericin B, and 
fluconazole in a persistently neutropenic rabbit model of disseminated candidiasis (Candida albicans). 
Anidulafungin doses were 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg per day. Fungal burden was assessed in liver, 
spleen, kidney, lung, vena cava, and brain. Doses of anidulafungin ≥0.5 mg/kg cleared fungal burden in 
all tissues to below lower limits of detection. Doses of 0.25 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in 
fungal burden in all tissues with the exception of the brain. The PK of anidulafungin was determined in 
healthy rabbits at the same doses. Although the absolute AUC values would not be considered directly 
translatable to humans, given the nature of this experimental model (neutropenic animals, etc.), it is 
noted that the PK was linear, i.e., doses were directly proportional to AUC. 
Overall, these data suggest that anidulafungin can penetrate brain tissue and produce antifungal activity, 
although 2x higher doses were needed to produce a significant decrease in fungal burden in the brain 
relative to other tissues. It should also be noted that activity of anidulafungin in brain tissue in this study 
should be considered in light of the animals having disseminated disease, and hence the blood-brain 
barrier would be expected to be disrupted relative to a healthy animal. 
HCME model in rabbits (Warn et al., 2012) 
This study was conducted specifically to address the question of appropriate dosing of anidulafungin in 
neonates. A rabbit model of HCME was used to define PK/PD relationships for antifungal activity of 
anidulafungin in the brain, and subsequently, a population PK model for human neonates was used to 
project efficacious dosing regimens, based on the observed PK/PD in rabbit HCME. 
Rabbits were inoculated with C. albicans intravenously, after which there was progressive logarithmic 
growth in the cerebrum. Without therapy, no animals survived beyond 96 hours. Anidulafungin (5, 10, or 
20 mg/kg) was administered starting 48 hours after inoculation. An antifungal effect as measured by 
fungal burden in the cerebrum was evident at the 10 and 20 mg/kg doses, while a smaller effect was 
observed at the 5 mg/kg dose. PK of anidulafungin was linear, with dose-dependent penetration into the 
cerebrum. Based on PK/PD bridging to human neonates, it was estimated that the AUC of 100 to 120 
mg*h/L that is associated with clinical efficacy in adults would be associated with a submaximal 
antifungal effect, and that an AUC of approximately 200 to 240 mg*h/L should be targeted. 
One limitation of this study is that fungal burden in non-CNS tissues was not reported, and hence it was 
not possible to assess the relative dose/exposures to treat CNS tissues versus non CNS. That limitation 
was addressed however in a subsequent publication, as described below. 
Experimental Candida Endophthalmitis model in rabbits (Livermore et al., 2013) 
This publication is derived from the same HCME rabbit study described above. However, this publication 
reports the fungal burden and antifungal activity of anidulafungin in the vitreous humor and the kidney, 
whereas the prior publication was focused on the brain. 
Rabbits were inoculated with C. albicans intravenously, after which there was progressive logarithmic 
growth in the vitreous humor and the kidney. Anidulafungin (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was administered 
starting 48 hours after inoculation. The 5 mg/kg dose of anidulafungin had minimal effect on fungal 
burden in the vitreous humor, but did have an effect on the kidney. The 10 and 20 mg/kg doses had 
progressively greater effects in both tissues, with effects in the kidney more pronounced than vitreous 
humor. It was estimated that stasis is achieved in the kidney at a plasma AUC of approximately 100 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 9/82 
 
 
  
  
mg*h/L, whereas stasis in the vitreous humor was achieved at a plasma AUC of approximately 270 
mg*h/L. 
Overall, the results of these two publications using the rabbit HCME model suggest that an approximately 
2- to 3-x higher dose/exposure of anidulafungin is needed to treat infections of the brain and vitreous 
humor relative to the kidney. This is likely because both brain and vitreous humor are protected by 
blood/brain (or blood/ocular) barriers, as opposed to the kidney, which is well-perfused. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
As part of the development of the paediatric indication for anidulafungin, the tissue distribution of 
anidulafungin into bone, brain and heart tissues of neonatal rats (postnatal Day 4 to 8) was 
characterized. After repeat dose administration, concentrations of anidulafungin in bone were similar to 
plasma, and concentrations of anidulafungin in the heart were 1.3- to 1.8-times higher than plasma. 
Concentrations of anidulafungin in the brain were lower than plasma after a single dose, but 
concentrations were higher after 24 hours and were similar to levels in plasma after 5 days of dosing. 
Results from this study demonstrated that anidulafungin distributes to bone, brain and heart tissues 
following single- or repeat-dose subcutaneous administration to neonatal rats. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Juvenile studies 
Single-dose, exploratory and definitive repeat-dose toxicity studies with subcutaneous administration 
were conducted with anidulafungin in neonatal rats and in combination with voriconazole in juvenile rats. 
Anidulafungin was evaluated in a dose-range single-dose toxicity study in neonatal rats at 0, 75, and 100 
mg/kg/day. Doses up to 100 mg/kg were well tolerated in rat pups administered anidulafungin 
intravenously, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally on postnatal Day (PND) 7. At 100 mg/kg, lower body 
weight gains were observed 24 hours after dosing on PND 7 in each sex that was administered 
anidulafungin intravenously. Despite the body weight gains at each tabulated interval, there was no 
overall change in body weight at the end of the recovery period. All single doses of anidulafungin 
appeared well tolerated. Toxicokinetic data suggested the plasma concentration-time profile after 
subcutaneous dosing is most consistent with the clinical plasma concentration versus time profile. 
In the repeat-dose neonatal and juvenile rat studies, rats were administered anidulafungin 
subcutaneously alone or in combination with voriconazole (oral gavage). In neonatal studies, rats were 
administered anidulafungin (SC; 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) from PND 4 to 62, with a 5-week recovery 
period. In juvenile studies, rats received anidulafungin (SC; 30 mg/kg/day) or voriconazole (PO; 3 or 10 
mg/kg/day) alone or in combination once daily from PND 21 to 56 with a recovery period to PND 84. The 
primary anidulafungin-related effects were reduced body weights (including terminal weights) and body 
weight gains, increased liver weights, hepatocellular single cell necrosis (in the juvenile definitive study 
only) and minimal changes in hematology and serum chemistry parameters. These effects were 
consistent with findings that occurred in previous studies with multiple species evaluating the test article 
and were not considered adverse because of the small magnitude of change and lack of correlation with 
microscopic changes. Furthermore, the addition of voriconazole to anidulafungin treatment did not result 
in new toxicity when administered for 5 weeks at combined dosages as high as 10/30 mg/kg/day 
(voriconazole/anidulafungin). The NOAEL for anidulafungin in the neonatal rat definitive repeat-dose 
study following once-daily subcutaneous administration was 30 mg/kg/day.

Other toxicity studies 
Risk Assessment for Polysorbate 80 
Anidulafungin is formulated as a sterile, lyophilized product for intravenous infusion that contains 
approximately 25% polysorbate 80 at a ratio of 2.56:1 polysorbate 80: anidulafungin (mg:mg). 
Polysorbate 80 has been used extensively as a solubilizing agent in other marketed parenteral drug 
products. A review of safety data pertaining to its use in neonates was performed to determine if the 
increased anidulafungin doses needed to treat neonates with invasive candidiasis with central nervous 
system involvement and the consequent higher exposures to polysorbate 80 are appropriate for this 
patient population. This review is summarized below. 
Anidulafungin has been administered to neonates using the commercial, polysorbate 80 containing 
formulation in a completed Phase 1 study, and was generally well-tolerated at the dose and duration that 
was used in the trial. However, the increased doses of anidulafungin and hence polysorbate 80 under 
consideration for use in neonates are 2- and 3-fold greater than the dose used in the completed study, 
and could potentially be administered for a longer duration. The proposed mean daily dose of polysorbate 
80 that would occur at the highest dose of anidulafungin under consideration is similar to doses that are 
administered to neonates receiving approved parenteral vitamin preparations. The cumulative polysorbate 
80 doses that would occur at the highest dose of anidulafungin under consideration are approximately 
8.7-fold lower than the lowest cumulative precedent intravenous dose, and approximately 12-fold lower 
than the mean precedent cumulative dose of polysorbates at which neonatal mortality occurred following 
E-Ferol administration. While these comparisons indicate that a safety margin exists, it should be noted 
that in the case of E-Ferol the calculated margins are based on polysorbate doses that were associated 
with severe toxicity and deaths. In addition, anidulafungin itself has been shown to produce hepatic 
toxicity at low multiples of human exposure in nonclinical studies in rats and monkeys, and the doses to 
be administered in the planned clinical study are predicted to result in anidulafungin exposures similar to 
those observed at the NOAEL. Importantly, there is uncertainty about the role of polysorbates in the 
toxicity and deaths in neonates that received E-Ferol. Regardless, there are currently insufficient 
preclinical and clinical safety data available to definitively support the use of the proposed increased 
concentrations of polysorbate 80 in neonates at higher anidulafungin doses. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No updated environmental risk assessment was submitted by the MAH. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The efficacy of anidulafungin for infections of the brain has been evaluated in two rabbit disease models, 
a neutropenic model of disseminated disease and a hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis (HCME) 
model. These models appear relevant for a neonatal population due to a higher likelihood of disseminated 
disease, including the possibility of infection within the central nervous system. The rabbit models show 
that it is likely that a 2 to 3-fold higher plasma concentration of anidulafungin is required to treat fungal 
infections that may involve CNS tissues. There are, however, no clinical data to support a higher dose, 
since all patients in the clinical trials received a dose resulting in AUC values similar to those in adults. 
Higher doses are therefore not recommended. 
In neonatal rats, anidulafungin distributes to the brain, with similar concentrations to plasma after 5 days 
of dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 11/82 
 
 
  
  
Repeated dose toxicity studies in neonatal (dosing from PND4) or juvenile (dosing from PND21) rats 
revealed no increased susceptibility to liver toxicity as observed with adult animals. Also, no new 
toxicities were observed with doses up to 30 mg/kg/day.  
High plasma concentration of polysorbate 80, an excipient present in the Ecalta formulation, is associated 
with severe neonatal toxicity, including death. Higher doses of Ecalta which would be needed to treat CNS 
infection would result in higher polysorbate 80 concentrations. A higher dose, however, is not applied for 
in the current procedure. There are currently insufficient preclinical and clinical safety data available to 
definitively support a higher dose than the one recommended in the SmPC (3.0 mg/kg loading dose, 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day maintenance). An appropriate warning is present in SmPC section 4.4. 
It was considered that a phase II ERA is already present in the dossier. For this ERA in the dossier, a 
default Fpen has been used to come to a PECsurfacewater of 1.0 µg/L, triggering a phase II assessment. 
In phase II, the PEC was revised based on human transformation data, and risk assessment for the 
different compartments were made using study data. It was therefore accepted that addition of a 
paediatric population to the indication will not alter the ERA, as a default Fpen was used. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in neonatal or juvenile rats revealed no increased susceptibility to liver 
toxicity as observed with adult animals. 
High plasma concentration of polysorbate 80, an excipient present in the Ecalta formulation, is associated 
with severe neonatal toxicity, including death. Higher doses of Ecalta, which would be needed to treat 
CNS infection, would result in higher polysorbate 80 concentrations. This is not relevant, however, as a 
higher dose is not applied for with this procedure. 
Based on the information submitted during the assessment of this application, the new/extended 
indication may lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure of anidulafungin. It was however 
accepted that addition of a paediatric population to the indication will not result in the need to alter the 
ERA.

•  A8851008 - A Prospective, Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of 
Anidulafungin when used to Treat Children with Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia 
Duke University Investigator-Initiated Research Study (Duke IIR Study) 
The Duke IIR Study was an investigator-initiated study conducted at Duke University in the United States 
(US). It was an open-label study designed to assess the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of IV 
anidulafungin administered to infants and neonates at risk for ICC. 
Study design 
The Duke IIR Study was a prospective, open-label, single-centre, pharmacokinetic study of anidulafungin 
in 15 infants and neonates less than 24 months of age at risk for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. 
Subjects received study drug for up to 5 days and were stratified by age, from 0-30 days (neonates) and 
>30 days to 2 years (infants). The median postnatal age, gestational age at birth, and birth weight of all 
subjects enrolled were 28 days (range; 2-451), 36 weeks (24-40), and 2090 g (660-3969), respectively. 
Subjects received anidulafungin 3 mg/kg loading dose on study day 1 and 1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours on 
study days 2-5. The dosage studied in these infants and neonates was extrapolated from studies in older 
children.  
Blood was collected to determine plasma concentrations of anidulafungin on Days 1 and 3 to 5. On Day 1, 
blood samples were collected at the end of the 1-hour infusion, 3 to 6, 8 to 12, and 18 to 24 hours from 
the start of the infusion. On day 5, blood samples were collected within two hours prior to the start of the 
anidulafungin infusion, at the end of the 1-hour infusion, 3 to 6, 8 to 12, and 18 to 24 hours from the 
start of the infusion. Additionally, samples at 48 and 72 hours after the last dose were obtained but did 
not exceed 9 total samples per patient.  
In order to minimize the amount of blood sampling, hematology and chemistry laboratory measures were 
obtained per local standard of care. The Day 5 sampling scheme could be completed on Day 3 or Day 4 if 
the infant or neonate received <5 days of therapy. If an infant weighed <1000 g at enrollment, and the 
acquisition of pharmacokinetic samples represented greater than minimal risk, then the Day 5 sampling 
was deferred. 
The CHMP considered the design of the pharmacokinetic part of the study to be acceptable. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Plasma samples were assayed for anidulafungin by use of a validated liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry method (PPD, Richmond, VA). The method was validated in the linear range from 
0.05 to 20.0 μg/mL with an overall precision of over 95.9% and accuracy of 96.8-104.2%. 
A validated bioanalytical method for the analysis of anidulafungin in plasma was applied, the accuracy 
and precision of which were acceptable to the CHMP. 
Results 
The PK population was the subset of all subjects in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population who received 
anidulafungin on at least 3 days and who provided blood samples used to assess evaluable anidulafungin 
plasma samples. Fourteen subjects were included in the PK analysis. One hundred and nineteen plasma 
concentrations were obtained from 14 subjects. 
According to the MAH, anidulafungin concentration-time profiles were similar between age cohorts. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters (noncompartmental analysis) after the loading dose and multiple dosing are

summarized in table PK 1. After the loading dose, only observed maximum anidulafungin concentrations 
were obtained; other PK parameters were not calculated for the loading dose given an insufficient number 
of samples. 
Table PK 1. Summary of anidulafungin pharmacokinetic parameters by age cohort. 
Conclusion 
Anidulafungin plasma concentration-time profiles were similar between age cohorts. Exposure to 
anidulafungin was not related to postmenstrual age. The overall anidulafungin exposure in infants and 
neonates administered 1.5 mg/kg/day of anidulafungin was similar (within 15%) to that of older 
children and adults (AUCss 100 μg*h/ml).  
The combined exposure data of infants and neonates administered 1.5 mg/kg/day of anidulafungin (i.e. 
93 µg.h/ml) was comparable to those observed in adults (100 µg.h/ml). However, in neonates, the 
exposure is about 27% lower and in infants the exposure is about 21% higher compared to adults. The 
CHMP noted that the results of this study should be interpreted with caution, considering the low 
number of subjects included and the observed variability up 66%. However, the data were included in 
the popPK analysis combined with data from study A8851008, including a higher number of subjects 
(n=60).

Study A8851008 
Study design 
Study A8851008 was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, multinational study 
designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of anidulafungin for the treatment of ICC in paediatric 
patients 1 month to <18 years of age.  
All study subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on study day 1 followed 
by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter), administered at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or less. Subjects 
were to receive anidulafungin IV for a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 days. There was an 
option to switch to oral treatment with fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at 
least 10 days of IV treatment, provided the subject met pre specified criteria. 
• 
In order to confirm the appropriateness of the protocol’s study dosing regimen for the 1 month to <2 
years old age group, the first 6 children in this age group were enrolled in a PK sub-study in which 
intensive PK sampling was conducted at selected centers. The PK sub-study completed prior to 
protocol Amendment 8, therefore polysorbate 80 plasma concentrations were not assessed in these 6 
subjects. Following initiation of treatment, blood samples (approximately 0.3 to 0.5 mL each) were 
collected for anidulafungin measurement at 6 time points as follows: On day 1 (receiving 3 mg/kg IV 
infusion): 2 minutes before the end of infusion 
•  On day 2 (receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV infusion): Just prior to the start of infusion; 2 minutes before the 
end of infusion, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the start of infusion 
Blood samples (approximately 0.3 to 0.5 mL each) for anidulafungin measurement and blood samples 
(approximately 1 mL each for subjects enrolled under protocol amendment 8) for polysorbate 80 
measurement were collected at 3 to 5 occasions at the same time points as anidulafungin during Day 1 
through Day 9 for all study subjects, with the exception of subjects in the PK sub-study: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
day 1: postdose (between 0 and 2 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 3: predose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 5: postdose (between 0 and 3 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 7: delayed postdose (between 6 and 12 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion) 
day 9: predose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion) 
The CHMP considered the design of the pharmacokinetic part of study A8851008 to be acceptable. 
The doses of anidulafungin used in this study (3.0 mg/kg loading followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day) were 
expected to achieve total exposures comparable to those observed in a pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, 
randomized study (VER002-9) of subjects aged 16 years and above with ICC where anidulafungin was 
compared to fluconazole. Benjamin et al. demonstrated that paediatric body weight was the primary 
consideration in achieving anidulafungin plasma concentrations comparable to adults, and further 
showed that paediatric subjects receiving 1.5 mg/kg/day IV anidulafungin had concentration profiles 
and drug exposures similar to those in adults receiving 100 mg/day. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The plasma samples were analyzed for anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 using validated high 
performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-/MS/MS). The 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for anidulafungin was 50.00 ng/ml. The LLOQ for polysorbate 80 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 15/82 
 
 
  
  
was 5.00 μg/ml.Validated bioanalytical methods for the analysis of anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 in 
plasma were applied, the accuracy and precision of which made them acceptable to the CHMP. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetic sub-study 
The final PK sub-study dataset included 6 anidulafungin concentrations per subject plus 1 concentration 
prior to start of treatment. These data were obtained from the 6 subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age 
group who underwent intensive (serial) PK sampling. One subject (10281005) did not have a sample at 
the end of loading dose on Day 1. 
The anidulafungin plasma concentrations for all 6 of the subjects are presented by subject and sampling 
time on Day 1 and 2. A descriptive summary of anidulafungin PK parameters from these 6 subjects is 
presented and summarized in table PK 2. 
Table PK 2. Summary of anidulafungin PK parameters in PK sub-study (first 6 subjects in the 1 month to 
<2 year age group). 
It was concluded that the anidulafungin exposures in these 6 subjects fell within the expected range for 
adult ICC patients dosed with 200 mg load followed by 100 mg/day (110 µg.h/ml) (see also discussion on 
pharmacokinetics). 
Pharmacokinetic sparse sampling 
The PK dataset, excluding data from the 6 subjects enrolled in the PK sub-study, included 253 
anidulafungin plasma concentrations from 60 subjects (11 subjects from 1 month to <2 years; 19 
subjects 2 to <5 years; 30 subjects 5 to <18 years) who underwent sparse PK sampling. These data are 
presented for individual subjects by sampling time and age group and will be combined with the PK sub-
study and additional concentration data from other studies and analyzed in a population PK analysis to be 
reported separately (see below). The anidulafungin plasma concentrations from these 60 subjects 
generally fell within the expected ranges for adult ICC subjects dosed with 200 mg loading followed by 
100 mg per day. 
Polysorbate 80 
The final PK dataset contained 28 polysorbate 80 samples from 8 subjects (1 month to <2 years of age) 
enrolled under protocol amendment 8. These data are presented for individual subjects by sampling time 
and age group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020

Only one subject of the 8 subjects had one sample which was collected 5 hours post infusion on Day 1 
from subject 10651006, a 20-month old white male weighing 13 kg, was above the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ: 5.0 µg/mL) with a polysorbate 80 concentration of 5.3 µg/ml. Otherwise, none of the 
other samples, including those for this subject, had detectable polysorbate 80 concentrations and they 
were all below the LLOQ. Therefore, plasma concentrations of polysorbate 80 were low or undetectable in 
infants 1 month to <2 years of age following administration of anidulafungin 3.0 mg/kg loading and 1.5 
mg/kg per day. 
Conclusions 
Anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 PK results support an anidulafungin dose recommendation of 3.0 mg/kg 
load followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day for paediatric ICC patients aged 1 month to 17 years.  
The finding of extremely low/undetectable levels of polysorbate 80 post-infusion, along with safety results 
from the study, suggest that presence of this excipient in the anidulafungin formulation, at the 
recommended dose of anidulafungin, is not a safety issue in infants as young as 1 month of age. 
The above conclusions on the results of pharmacokinetic characterization were agreed upon by the 
CHMP. 
Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
The goal of the PK-sub study was to confirm the appropriateness of the dosing regimen for the 1 month 
to <2 years old age group. It was concluded that anidulafungin exposure in these 6 sub-study subjects 
fell within the expected range for the adult population, which would support the chosen dose regimen. 
The Pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin have been characterized adequately during this study. The dosing 
regimen of 3.0 mg/kg loading, followed by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance in the population of 1 month to <2 
years, resulted in a lower exposure to those observed in the adult population. An AUC0-24 of 66.4 µg.hr/ml 
(28%CV) and Cmax of 5.96 µg/ml (29%CV) was observed for the first 6 subjects in the 1 month to <2 
year age group, while for the adult population (at a loading dose of 200 mg and a daily dose of 100 mg) 
AUCss was about 110 μg.h/ml and Cmax 7.2 μg/ml. It is noted that the observed AUC is lower in the young 
age group, and the calculated AUC was not based on measurements from steady-state conditions. 
Population PK/PD analysis have been applied to support that exposure in the youngest age group 
compared to adult patients is in the same range and therefore support the appropriateness of the dosing 
regimen of 3.0 mg/kg loading followed by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance the next day (see section 5.3.4 PK/PK 
modelling). 
Further based on this study, in which polysorbate 80 was measured 5-hour post-dose in samples from 8 
subjects in the month to <2 years of age group, concentrations of polysorbate 80 are not expected to be 
higher than 5.3 µg/ml in these patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new information on the pharmacodynamics of anidulafungin was submitted with this application. This 
is appropriate and acceptable.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
As recorded in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) communication of 24 September 2007 which 
summarized all the post-approval commitments agreed during the European review and approval of 
Ecalta, for follow-up measure (FUM) 018/018.1/018.2, the Sponsor committed to the incorporation of a 
PK/PD component in the following studies A8851008, A8851011 and A8851019 and the submission of the

results when available to explore the relationships between anidulafungin exposure and response in 
patients with ICC. 
All 3 studies evaluated safety and efficacy in ICC patient populations (adult and paediatric). PK data were 
obtained in subsets of patients in studies A8851011 and A8851019. 
Anidulafungin data in paediatric subjects under 2 years of age were limited in Study A8851008 due to 
enrollment challenges. To complement the data collected within this age group in the A8851008 study, 
the anidulafungin PK data (intensive PK) in infants and neonates with suspected serious infections from 
the Duke IIR Study were included in the PK analysis. Although the Duke IIR Study was excluded from the 
efficacy and safety analyses, since it was primarily designed as a Phase 1 PK study, with this addition, the 
PK profile of anidulafungin was characterized with the full span of the age range. 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analysis of anidulafungin in paediatric and adult patients 
with invasive fungal infections 
A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to describe PK across adult and paediatric 
subjects (0-18 years) with ICC. In this joint analysis, the anidulafungin exposures in the paediatric 
subjects are comparable to those in adult subjects. 
Exploratory graphical exposure-efficacy (global response and all-cause mortality) analyses showed no 
relationship between anidulafungin exposure measures and efficacy endpoints at the end of IV treatment 
(EOIVT), end of treatment (EOT), and end of study (EOS). This is consistent with previous findings. 
Global response success rates of 63% or more were observed across the studies at EOIVT and EOT. 
Based on subjects with PK data, global response rates at EOIVT for Studies A8851008, A8851011, and 
A8851019 were 71%, 90.3%, and 70.7%, respectively. 
Although there was an observed trend towards an increased incidence of hepatic adverse events (AEs) 
with higher exposures, no statistically significant associations between anidulafungin exposures and 
hepatic or gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were identified in this joint paediatric and adult analysis using either 
linear or maximum effect (Emax) relationships. 
These findings are consistent with the previous exposure-safety analysis, in which no association between 
anidulafungin exposures and hepatic and GI AEs were identified in paediatric or adult subjects treated for 
ICC. 
Study Design 
Four studies were included in the PK analyses. 
•  Study A8851008. 
•  Study A8851011 was a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, non-comparative study for the treatment of 
ICC in neutropenic and non-neutropenic adult patients (≥ 18 years) with Candida infections. Subjects 
received anidulafungin IV treatment 200 mg LD followed by 100 mg MD for a minimum of 5 days. 
Sparse PK was to have been sampled in 33 subjects. 
•  Study A8851019 was a Phase 3b, prospective, open-label, non-comparative study for the treatment 
of documented ICC in intensive care unit adult patients (≥18 years). Subjects received anidulafungin 
IV treatment of 200 mg LD followed by 100 mg MD for a minimum of 10 days. Intensive PK was 
performed in 22 subjects with sparse PK in 28 subjects. 
• 
The Duke IIR study. 
PK sampling schedule for the 4 studies is presented in table PK 3.

Table PK 3. PK sampling schedules. 
The efficacy population consisted of modified intent-to-treat (mITT) patients (subjects with confirmed 
Candida infection who received at least one dose of study drug). The efficacy endpoints included global 
response (success versus [vs.] failure) at EOIVT and EOT, and all-cause mortality (alive vs. died) during 
study therapy period EOT (including IV and oral) and EOS including follow up period. Only subjects with 
PK were included in the joint exposure-efficacy analysis. 
The safety population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of the study treatment 
(anidulafungin). Two types of adverse events (AEs) (i.e., all-causality hepatic and GI AEs) were the focus 
of this analysis. Subjects who did not experience hepatic or GI AEs were considered as non-AE subjects. 
AEs that were reported by the investigator as related to study drug were considered as treatment-related 
AEs. Only subjects with PK were included in the joint exposure-safety analysis. 
Note that the Duke IIR Study was not included for either exposure-efficacy or exposure safety analyses 
since it was designed as primarily as a PK study. 
Methods 
The population PK analyses were conducted using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. 
Exposure-response (efficacy and safety endpoints) modeling was performed using maximum likelihood 
method once graphical analyses demonstrated a possible exposure-response relationship. The software 
packages NONMEM, version 7.3 and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN) version 4.2.0 were used as supporting 
software for the execution of NONMEM. R version 3.4.1 was used for data manipulation, exploratory data 
analysis and creation of graphs for presentations and reports. The preferred estimation methods were 
first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) for PK and LAPLACE for categorical 
data (efficacy and safety). 
The goodness of fit of different models to the data was evaluated using the following criteria: change in 
the objective function value (OFV), visual inspection of various diagnostic plots, the precision of the 
parameter estimates. Visual predictive check (VPC) and prediction corrected visual predictive check 
(pcVPC) were performed for the final PK model to qualify the models for prediction of the concentration 
data. 
Exposure parameters at steady state AUC0-24,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss/MIC for PK/PD analyses were 
calculated using the individual parameter estimates obtained from the final PK model.

a in Study A8851019, one (10821004) subject was missing Race information 
Observed Efficacy Data 
There were a total of 484 subjects (64 paediatric and 420 adults) in the mITT population from the 3 
studies included in the efficacy data. Of these, 134 subjects had paired estimated exposure parameters 
(PK) and efficacy data available and were included in the analyses. 
Only 121 subjects had MIC data available for anidulafungin PK/PD index assessment. In the paired PK/PD 
mITT population, global response of success rate at EOT was 72.58%, 83.87% and 68.29% for study 
A8851008, A8851011, and A8851019, respectively. The percentage of subjects in the joint analysis 
surviving at EOS was 88.71%, 96.77%, and 73.17% for studies A8851008, A8851011, and A8851019, 
respectively. 
In study A8851008, there were 8 deaths during the study reporting period, and 2 deaths (subjects 
10791002 and 10811002) that occurred outside of the safety reporting period (after the 6-week follow-up 
visit) were included in all-cause mortality analysis as alive at EOS. There were 17 and 44 subjects who 
died by EOS for studies A8851011 and A8851019, respectively but not all had paired PK data. 
Observed Safety Data 
There were a total of 566 subjects in the safety population across all studies. However, only 149 of these 
subjects had estimated exposure parameters (PK). Subjects who did not experience either hepatic or GI 
AEs were counted as not having an AE (non-AE) as long as they had PK data. 
In study A8851008, there were a total of 68 subjects included in the safety population. Of these, 66 
subjects were included in exposure/safety analyses as 2 subjects (subject 10061001 and 10061002) did 
not have PK taken. Thirty-two (48.48%) of the 66 subjects had neither hepatic nor GI AEs reported 
during the anidulafungin treatment period. Twelve (18.18%) subjects and 27 subjects (40.91%) reported

hepatic and/or GI AEs emergent during anidulafungin treatment, respectively. Of these, 6 and 7 subjects 
had treatment related hepatic and GI AEs during treatment period, respectively. There were 6 and 18 
subjects who had more than one hepatic and GI AEs, respectively. 
Thirty-three and 50 subjects had paired exposure and safety data available in studies A8851011 and 
A8851019, respectively. Of these, 26 (78.79%) and 31 (62%) had neither hepatic nor GI AEs, 3 (9.09%) 
and 7 (14%) had hepatic AEs, and 6 (18.18%) and 15 (30%) had GI AEs for Studies A8851011 and 
A8851019, respectively. 
Population PK Modeling 
The key runs for model development are listed in table PK 5. Based on the OFV change and diagnostic 
plots, Run15 was selected as the final base model. 
Table PK 5. List of key runs. 
The final PK model was a two-compartment disposition model with first order elimination. Body weight 
was a structural covariate on clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (Vc), and peripheral volume of 
distribution (Vp). No other covariates (eg. age or sex) were identified as statistically significant. For a 
typical subject with a body weight of 70 kg, CL, Vc, Vp, and inter-compartmental clearance (Q) were 
estimated to be 1.16 L/h, 26.7 L, 22.4 L, and 2.37 L/h, respectively. The inter-individual variance (IIV)s 
for CL, Vc, Vp and Q were 37.9%, 46.5%, 53.8% and 52.2% respectively (see table PK 6 parameter 
estimates for the final model).

data. The plots of VPC stratified by study versus time after first dose are presented in figure PK 3. Figure 
PK 4 is the VPC plots stratified by study versus time after dose. In general, the plots indicate that the 
final model predicts the data well across the studies, except where Duke IIR Study data were under-
predicted. Further, pcVPC by age group is shown in figure PK 5. A good match is observed between the 
median, 5th and 95th percentiles for the observed and simulated data across the age group.

The overall evaluation of these exposure data indicates that the currently proposed IV dosing regimen (a 
3.0 mg/kg [not to exceed 200 mg] LD followed by 1.5 mg/kg [not to exceed 100 mg] MD QD) is 
appropriate for use across all paediatric and adolescent age groups (1 month to <18 years old) since the 
anidulafungin exposures achieved are comparable to those in adults at the recommended dosing regimen 
(200 mg LD/100 mg MD QD). 
Estimated allometric exponents to describe the body weight relationship were used in the PopPK model, 
hence the body weight relationship could be mostly influenced by the adolescent and adult body weights 
(median in the dataset is 54 kg).  
By using theoretical allometric exponents the model performed less well than the model with estimated 
exponents, with a better fit of the data. Therefore, the model with estimated exponents was considered 
appropriate for fitting of the data, which is agreed by the CHMP.  
Efficacy graphical analysis 
Anidulafungin exposure parameters (AUC0-24,ss, Cmin,ss and PK/PD index [AUC0-24,ss/MIC]) were 
examined graphically as potential predictors for global response at the EOIVT and EOT and all-cause 
mortality at EOT and EOS including the 6 weeks follow-up in the mITT subjects with PK data. There was a 
substantial overlap in anidulafungin exposures among the global response success, failure and 
indeterminate groups. The anidulafungin exposures in subjects who had died overlapped with those in 
subjects who were alive at EOT and EOS. 
Probability of global response of success/failure was evaluated for the mITT subjects (with indeterminate 
excluded) for AUC0-24,ss quantile groups (quantile <=20%, >20% to 40%, >40% to 60%, >60% to 
80%, >80%). The probability of global response (success or failure) for each of the AUC0-24,ss bins for 
all data and Study A8851008 are presented in Figure 1 (grey area is the probability of success and blue 
area is the probability of failure). Each bar plot shows the observed probability of the efficacy endpoint, 
calculated as the ratio of the number of successful outcomes in a particular bin to the total number in that 
bin and presented as a percentage vs. exposure AUC0-24,ss on the x-axis. Based on these data, global 
response failure does not appear to be related to lower exposure of anidulafungin in both the overall 
population and study A8851008.

Probability of survival for all data and study A8851008 was similarly evaluated for the 5 AUC0-24,ss 
quantile groups (figure 2). As there was no clear association observed between anidulafungin exposures 
and all-cause mortality in both overall population and A8851008, no further exposure-efficacy modeling 
analysis was performed.

Safety graphical and modeling analysis 
Anidulafungin exposure parameters (AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss) were examined graphically as potential 
predictors for the incidence of hepatic and GI AEs in the safety population with PK data available. There 
was overlap in anidulafungin exposure metrics among the non-AE and all-causality AEs for non-treatment 
related as well as for treatment-related AEs. 
Similar to the efficacy analysis, the probability of AE was analyzed graphically vs. 5 AUC0-24,ss 
groups/quantiles. There appears to be a trend towards an increased incidence of all-causality hepatic AEs 
with higher exposure in the overall population; but there does not appear to be any exposure relationship

for all-causality GI AEs (figure 3) (grey area is the probability without hepatic/GI AEs and blue area is the 
probability of AEs). 
However, when exposure parameters AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss were used for further hepatic and GI AEs 
incidence analyses using a proportional odds model (logistic regression), none of the exposure 
parameters was identified as a statistically significant predictor for hepatic AE or GI AE incidence. In 
addition, covariates of interest (age, sex and population) were tested and none of these factors was 
statistically significant. 
Figure 3. Probability of hepatic AE (upper panel) and gastrointestinal AE (lower panel) vs. anidulafungin 
AUC0-24,ss for all data (left panel) and study A8851008 (right panel) in safety population. 
Taking the graphical and modeling analyses results together, hepatic or GI AE incidence was not strongly 
associated with anidulafungin exposures. 
The results indicated that there is a trend towards an increased incidence of all-causality hepatic AEs with 
higher exposure in the overall population. With regards to anidulafungin-related treatment-emergent 
hepatic AEs, although a some what higher incidence at higher AUCs, no clear exposure-AE trends were 
observed.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A two-compartment PK model with first-order elimination adequately described the anidulafungin data 
from paediatric and adult subjects with ICC infections or those at risk for invasive fungal infections. Body 
weight was a structural covariate on CL, Vc, and Vp. PK parameters of anidulafungin were not affected by 
age and sex. In the model estimated allometric exponents to describe the body weight relationship was 
used, while it is advised by the EMA MSWP Q&A to investigate theoretical allometric exponents. The MAH 
was requested to provide such data. They explained that, by using theoretical allometric exponents, the 
model performed less well than the model with estimated exponents, with a better fit of the data. 
Therefore, the model with estimated exponents was considered appropriate for fitting of the data. The 
MAH argument was acceptable and agreed upon.  
To be noted, anidulafungin is not metabolised by the liver. Under physiological pH and temperature it is 
opened to a peptide with an open ring which is further metbolsied by peptide degradation. It is thus not 
expected that maturing issues in neonates of metabolic pathways play an important role.Based upon the 
popPK analysis, the proposed IV dosing regimen (3.0 mg/kg LD followed by 1.5 mg/kg MD QD) is 
considered appropriate for paediatric use since the anidulafungin exposures achieved with this regimen in 
paediatric subjects are comparable to that in adults at the recommended dosing regimen (200 mg LD/100 
mg MD QD). However, in the individual studies the differences in exposure in paediatrics and adults 
appeared to be much more pronounced. In the Duke IIR study combined exposure data of infants and 
neonates was comparable to those observed in adults, however in neonates the exposure is about 27% 
lower and in infants the exposure is about 21% higher compared to adults. Also, in study A8851008 in 
the 6 sub-study subjects exposure was lower compared to adults. The MAH clarified that although 
individual studies showed some differences in PK, it should also be noted that a high variability is 
observed in paediatrics. Moreover, also in some adult studies a high variability and lower exposure has 
been observed. No clear relationships between anidulafungin exposure parameters and efficacy were 
identified in paediatric and adult subjects with ICC. The overall popPK data, however, indicated 
comparable median exposures with a large range in individual values for infants. As there was no clear 
exposure response identified, this was not considered of concern. 
No statistically significant relationships between anidulafungin exposures and incidence of anidulafungin 
treatment-emergent all-causality hepatic or GI AEs were identified in the combined paediatric and adult 
dataset. With regards to anidulafungin-related treatment-emergent hepatic AEs, although a somewhat 
higher incidence at higher AUCs, no clear exposure-AE trends are observed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed IV dosing regimen (3.0 mg/kg LD followed by /1.5 mg/kg MD QD) is considered appropriate 
for paediatric use since the anidulafungin exposures achieved with this regimen in paediatric subjects are 
comparable to that in adults at the recommended dosing regimen (200 mg LD/100 mg MD QD).

2.4.1.  Main study 
A8851008 - A Prospective, Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, 
Safety and Efficacy of Anidulafungin when used to Treat Children with 
Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia  
Methods 
Study A8851008 was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, multinational study 
designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of anidulafungin for the treatment of ICC in paediatric 
patients 1 month to <18 years of age.  
Considering the single-arm design of the study, inferences will be limited.  
Study participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria changed during the course of the study (see also under conduct of the 
study). Below are the inclusion criteria as per the final protocol amendment affecting these, Protocol 
Amendment 9, dated 16 September 2016.  
Prior to protocol Amendment 9 and at the time of enrolment, subjects must have had either a confirmed 
diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida spp. from a culture obtained from a normally sterile 
site within 96 hours prior to enrolment), or mycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida spp. 
Subjects may have been enrolled and initiated study treatment prior to culture confirmation of Candida 
spp. If positive culture confirmation for Candida spp. was not obtained subjects were discontinued from 
treatment; however, such subjects remained in the study for continued safety monitoring for up to 6 
weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Subjects had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment into the study: 
1. Subject must be either (1) at high risk for candidiasis or (2) have a definitive diagnosis of invasive 
candidiasis/candidemia (ICC), as defined below: 
a. At high risk for candidiasis (subjects 1 month to < 2 years of age only): 
Subject is at high risk for candidiasis and antifungal therapy with anidulafungin for a minimum of 5 
days is considered appropriate by the investigator. 
--OR-- 
b. Definitive diagnosis of invasive candidiasis/candidemia (ICC) (all age groups) is based on the growth of 
Candida sp. from a blood and/or tissue culture obtained from a normally sterile site. 
For the purpose of study entry, a subject enrolled with definitive diagnosis of ICC must have at least one 
microbiologic AND at least one clinical criterion listed below. 
Microbiologic Criteria: 
Subjects must have at least one of the criteria listed below either at the time of study entry or within 96 
hours prior to study entry.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study; 
Clinical Criteria: 
Subject must have at least one of the criteria listed below either at the time of study entry or within 96 
hours prior to study entry. 
• 
Fever, defined as an oral/tympanic temperature ≥100.4°F (38.0°C), rectal temperature ≥101.4°F 
(38.6°C) or an axillary temperature ≥99.4°F (37.4°C); 
•  Hypothermia, defined as a temperature less than 96.8°F (36.0°C); 
•  Hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 100% for age and gender norms 
(per National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group on Children and 
Adolescents guidelines); 
•  Other signs or symptoms of candidemia/invasive candidiasis, which may include the following: 
feeding intolerance, bloody stools, abdominal distension, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, colour 
change, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, unexplained metabolic acidosis. 
Subjects may be enrolled in the study and initiate study treatment on the basis of mycologic 
evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct 
microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae, or pseudohyphae) from a sample obtained from a 
normally sterile site (eg, blood and/or tissue). If culture confirmation of Candida sp. is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study and receive study treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator. Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study treatment, the 
subject will discontinued treatment but will remain in the study for continued safety monitoring 
for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Refer to Section 6.5 and Section 6.6 for 
follow-up visit requirements. 
Positive cultures for Candida sp. from urine (in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of 
pyelonephritis), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endotracheal aspiration, gastric drainage 
or gastric aspiration do not qualify as a positive culture for definitive diagnosis of ICC.

its excipients (including fructose), or to other echinocandin antifungals. 
4.  Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential not using 
highly effective contraception or not agreeing to continue highly effective contraception during the 
treatment period and up to the 6 week follow-up visit.  
5.  Subjects who have failed antifungal therapy with any systemic echinocandin for this episode of 
candidiasis/candidemia. Recurrence within 2 weeks is considered failure of previous therapy. 
6.  Subjects with any of the following abnormal laboratory values: Total bilirubin, AST or ALT >5 times 
the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
7.  Subjects who require continued treatment with another systemic antifungal agent [oral

expected to remain on the stable regimen for the duration of the trial. 
10. Life expectancy <72 hours. 
11. Subjects with suspected Candida meningitis. (For Korean and Portuguese investigator sites only: 
Subjects with suspected Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis are also excluded.)

Inclusion and exclusion criteria changed during the course of the study. The protocol was updated to 
broaden the study population to include children aged 1 month to <2 years only who were at high risk for 
candidiasis, in order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in this lowest age group as 
requested by the PDCO. This could have changed the study population over the course of the study. The 
most impactful change in the protocol consists of protocol amendment 9.  
The MAH mentioned that despite the broadened entry criteria applied in Amendment 9, subjects enrolled 
under Amendment 9 were generally similar to those enrolled prior to the amendment, with only 2 
subjects enrolled as being at high risk for ICC without microbiologically confirmed ICC. No further 
analyses are requested to analyse the impact of these protocol changes. 
Treatments 
All study subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 followed 
by 1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter). Subjects were to receive anidulafungin IV for a 
minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 days. There was an option to switch to oral treatment with 
fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV treatment, provided 
the subject met pre specified criteria.  
Subjects who were enrolled under Amendment 9 without microbiologically confirmed Candida infection 
were treated with IV anidulafungin (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 followed by 1.5 mg/kg 
maintenance dose daily thereafter) at the discretion of the Investigator for a minimum of 5 days to a 
maximum of 35 days.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was: 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of anidulafungin, when used to treat children with ICC. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of anidulafungin, as measured by global response, at the following time points: 
end of IV treatment (EOIVT), end of treatment (EOT), and 2- and 6-week follow-up visits. 
To explore PK parameters of anidulafungin in children aged 1 month to <2 years following IV infusion 
of anidulafungin: area under the curve over the 24-hour dosing interval (AUC24) and maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax). 
To explore PK parameters of polysorbate 80 following IV infusion of anidulafungin AUC24 and Cmax. 
To explore the exposure-response (safety and efficacy endpoints) relationship of anidulafungin using 
a nonlinear mixed effects approach as appropriate, including exploring the association between the 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) index, eg, AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and efficacy 
endpoints. 
To assess rates of relapse (recurrence) at the 2- and 6-week follow-up visits. 
To assess rates of new infection at the 2- and 6-week follow-up visits. 
To assess all-cause mortality during study treatment and follow-up visits.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
•  Safety and tolerability of anidulafungin. 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Global response of success, failure, or indeterminate at the EOIVT and subsequent time points (see 
description below) 
• 
• 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin in children aged 1 month to <2 years following IV 
infusion of anidulafungin: AUC24 and Cmax; 
Exposure-response (efficacy and safety endpoints) relationships of anidulafungin using a nonlinear 
mixed effects approach as appropriate; 
•  Rates of relapse at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits; 
•  Rates of emerging infection at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits; 
•  All-cause mortality during study therapy and follow-up visits. 
Global response was defined as: 
•  Success: A subject was categorized as a success if there was both a clinical response of success (cure 
or improvement) and microbiological response of success (eradication or presumed eradication). 
• 
• 
Failure: A subject was categorized as a failure if there was a clinical response of failure and/or a 
microbiological failure (persistence or new infection at follow-up or relapse of infection at follow-up). 
Indeterminate: A subject was categorized as indeterminate if there was a clinical response of 
indeterminate and/or microbiological response of indeterminate and neither response was a failure.

In cases where the subject received concomitant antifungal use with activity for any baseline Candida 
spp., the following algorithms were used for determining global response at EOIVT, EOT, and 2- and 6-
week follow-up visits. 
• 
• 
• 
If a subject took 2 or more days of antifungal medications (as identified by the clinical team) after the 
start of study medication until EOT for any reason, the subject was imputed to failure for all visits 
that occurred after the antifungal medication was taken. 
If a subject took 1 day of antifungal medication after the start of study treatment until EOT for the 
reason “lack of efficacy” the subject was similarly imputed to failure for all visits that occurred after 
the antifungal medication was taken. The clinical team determined whether the antifungal medication 
was used for “lack of efficacy”. 
In the follow-up period, if a subject took at least 1 day of antifungal medication for reason of “lack of 
efficacy”, the subject was imputed to failure for all visits that occurred after the antifungal medication 
was taken. Again, the clinical team determined whether the antifungal medication had been used for 
“lack of efficacy”. 
Primary and secondary outcomes were considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
Sample size 
Since this was a descriptive study, sample size calculations were not performed. A sample size of 60 
evaluable subjects for this study was chosen for assessing safety and tolerability, PK, and efficacy in 
children with ICC. Subjects evaluable for efficacy were those that had received at least 1 dose of study 
drug and had a confirmed Candida infection.

Randomisation 
The study was single armed. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses populations 
The set of subjects for primary (safety) evaluation was the Safety population, defined as all subjects 
with at least 1 dose of study medication.  
Secondary efficacy analyses were to be assessed in the Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population, 
defined as all subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug and who have microbiological 
evidence of Candida infection.  
PP population: subjects in the MITT population, who also: 
•  Completed a minimum of 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, unless declared a clinical and/or 
microbiological failure. 
•  Received total antifungal treatment (IV only or IV plus oral) for a minimum duration of 14 days, 
unless declared a clinical and/or microbiological failure. 
•  Had not received more than 48 hours of systemic antifungal therapy (for treatment of current 
Candida infection) prior to first dose of study drug. 
•  Must not have had a prosthetic device and/or vascular catheter (including central venous catheter or 
an implantable port) at a suspected site of infection, unless the device was removed at study entry or 
soon after the first dose of study drug (prior to protocol Amendment 9). 
•  Had not taken more than 1 day of protocol prohibited antifungal therapy concomitant with study 
drug, unless declared a clinical and or microbiological failure. 
•  Reached the 6-weeks follow-up visit unless the subject died or withdrew consent prior to 6-week 
follow-up. 
•  Had no protocol violations that could have an impact on the efficacy endpoints. 
PK population: subjects who received a known amount of anidulafungin and who had 1 or more PK 
sample collected 
Analyses 
The primary analysis was the evaluation of adverse events throughout the trial, laboratory tests, 
temperature, and physical examination. The following parameters were to be summarized: rates of 
discontinuation, adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Safety data was to be descriptively 
summarized. Descriptive statistics for categorical data was to include frequencies and/or percentages.

Efficacy was based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and microbiological 
response as assessed by the Investigator) of success, failure, or indeterminate. For each age category, 
analysis of the global response at the EOIVT, EOT, and 2- and 6-week follow-up visits was performed for 
the Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) populations. The summary included the number 
of observations and estimated response rates overall and in each age category. 
This analysis was also performed by site of infection and by baseline Candida spp., combined across the 
age groups. 
In order to investigate the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. This analysis 
investigated the effect of ‘indeterminate’ and ‘missing’ global responses on the analysis by excluding 
subjects with ‘indeterminate’ and ‘missing’ responses from the analysis of global response. 
In addition to global response, summaries of clinical response, and microbiological response were also 
produced for the MITT and PP populations, and were presented overall, by each age category, by site of 
infection, and by each Candida spp.  
For clinical response, the number of subjects in each of the categories ‘Cure’, ‘Improvement’, ‘Failure’, 
‘Indeterminate’, and ‘Missing’ were presented. For microbiological response, the number of subjects in 
each of the categories ‘Eradication’, ‘Presumed Eradication’, ‘Persistence’, ‘Recurrence of Infection’, ‘New 
Infection’, ‘Indeterminate’, and ‘Missing’ were presented. 
•  Relapse (Recurrence) 
For each age category, the number and percentage of subjects with relapse at the 2- and 6-week follow-
up visits were calculated for the MITT population. The denominator for relapse was the number of 
subjects in the population at baseline. 
•  New Infection 
For each age category, the number and percentage of subjects who had new infection at the 2- and 6-
week follow-up visits were calculated for the MITT population. The denominator for the new infection was 
the number of subjects in that group and population at baseline.  
•  All-Cause Mortality 
For each age category, analysis of all-cause mortality during study treatment and follow-up visits was 
performed in the safety and MITT populations. Mortality at each time point was presented with exact 95% 
CIs for binomial proportion, using the Clopper-Pearson method which employs the F-distribution to obtain 
percentiles of the binomial distribution. All causes of death were summarized. 
• 
Time to Death 
Time to death (all-cause) was analyzed using the safety and MITT populations. For each age category, 
the number of subjects who died during the study reporting period was summarized by age stratum.

Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date: First Subject First Visit (FSFV): 27 Feb 2009 
Primary Completion Date: Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV): 14 Feb 2018 
Over the 9-year study duration, subjects were enrolled at 26 sites in 10 countries (Brazil, Canada, 
Greece, Italy, Republic of Korea, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom [UK], and United States [US]), 
and an additional 47 sites were supplied study drug but did not enrol any subjects. Study sites were 
established in 3 countries (France, Germany, and Portugal) that did not screen any subjects. 
The CHMP noted that recruitment into the trial was challenging and the duration of the study may have 
resulted in patients who were recruited earlier in the study no longer being comparable to patients 
recruited later in the study. 
Conduct of the study 
During the course of the study, 9 protocol amendments were implemented. Most significant amendments 
are listed here. Amendment 4 (2010) modified the entry criteria to allow enrolment of patients with 
Candida endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Amendment 8 (2015) added measurement of plasma 
concentrations of polysorbate 80 in the youngest age. Due to ongoing challenges in enrolling sufficient 
numbers of patients in the youngest age cohort (1 month to <2 years), Amendment 9 (2016) broadened 
the study population to align with regulatory agency feedback and to ensure that adequate numbers of 
appropriate patients were enrolled; in this latter amendment, patients at risk for Candida infection were 
permitted to be enrolled, in addition to the original target population, which was required to have 
confirmed Candida infection.

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics are summarized by age group in Table 9. 
A large proportion of subjects had a present medical history indicative of significant underlying disease, 
including blood and lymphatic system disorders (n=42, 65.6%), infections and infestations (n=40, 
62.5%), gastrointestinal disorders (n=38, 59.4%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(n=36, 56.3%), metabolism and nutritional disorders (n=34, 53.1%), and neoplasms benign, malignant, 
and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (n=24, 37.5%). 
The most frequently reported risk factors for Candida infection were the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics 
and the use of a central venous catheter (50 [78.1%] subjects each) followed by total parenteral nutrition 
(29 [45.3%] subjects). Nearly a third of subjects overall were receiving chemotherapy, were neutropenic 
(n=21 each, 32.8%), or were receiving systemic steroids /immunosuppressives (n=20, 31.3%). 
Approximately 25% of subjects had either surgery or abdominal surgery as a risk factor. Additionally, 16 
(25.0%) subjects had an intensive care unit length of stay of at least 4 days, and 11 (17.2%) subjects 
were mechanically ventilated.

EMA/304231/2020 
Page 45/82 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Overall, the most commonly reported baseline pathogens identified in the 64 subjects in the MITT 
population included Candida albicans (25 [39.1%] subjects), Candida parapsilosis (17 [26.6%] subjects), 
and Candida tropicalis (9 [14.1%] subjects). Among subjects in the 1 month to <2 years and the 2 to <5 
years age groups, Candida albicans was the most common baseline pathogen, while Candida parapsilosis 
was the most common baseline pathogen identified in the 5 to <18 years age group. The percent of 
subjects with Candida parapsilosis was lower in the 2 to <5 years age group (11.1%) compared to the 
other age groups: 31.3% and 33.3% in the 1 month to <2 years and the 5 to <18 years age groups, 
respectively. 
Prior and concomitant treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 46/82 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The 3 most commonly reported prior non-antifungal medications included paracetamol (n=29, 42.6%), 
meropenem (n=19, 27.9%), and vancomycin (n=18, 26.5%).  
The use of prior antifungals for the current episode of Candida infection was permitted up to a maximum 
of 48 hours for subjects enrolled prior to protocol Amendment 9, unless the antifungal was administered 
as prophylaxis. Three subjects received systemic antifungal therapy >48 hours prior to the first dose of 
study drug and were excluded from the PP population on this basis. 
A total of 46 (67.6%) subjects received systemic antifungals prior to the start of study drug. The most 
commonly used prior antifungal agents were fluconazole (29.4%), amphotericin B (13.2%), caspofungin, 
itraconazole, and micafungin (all 5.9%), and amphotericin B, liposome (4.4%). No notable trends were 
identified by age group. 
The 3 most commonly reported concomitant medications overall were paracetamol (n=29, 42.6%), 
vancomycin (n=25, 36.8%), and furosemide (n=23, 33.8%). 
Among the 64 patients enrolled in the MITT population, concomitant antifungal use was reported as 
follows: 
• 18 patients (28.1%) received no other systemic antifungal agents apart from anidulafungin during the 
study, 
• 31 patients (48.4%) were switched to oral fluconazole following anidulafungin, as permitted by the 
protocol; among these, 4 patients received additional fluconazole and/or other systemic antifungals 
during the post-treatment follow-up (FU) period and 1 patient died during the period of treatment 
with oral fluconazole, 
• 15 patients (23.4%) were not switched to oral fluconazole and received systemic antifungal treatment 
other than anidulafungin during the study. The majority of these cases were due to treatment failure 
and/or discontinuation from study treatment due to an AE. As per the protocol, patients switched to 
other antifungal agents following discontinuation from study treatment (for any reason) were to be 
followed through the 6-week follow-up visit. 
The most commonly used treatment was fluconazole, which was used as prophylaxis (per protocol), for 
11 [16.2%] subjects). 
Those subjects who received antifungal drug treatment that was not used as prophylaxis between EOT 
and prior to the 6-week follow-up visit were considered clinical failures based on the algorithm. 
The CHMP considered that baseline criteria are reflective of a patient population at high risk of ICC, with 
substantial underlying morbidity, high rates of underlying malignancies, high rate of parenteral nutrition, 
and substantial use of concomitant medication. Thirty-three % of subjects was neutropenic; similar 
proportions of patients were receiving chemotherapy or were receiving systemic steroids 
/immunosuppressives. The most prevalent baseline pathogens were Candida parapsilosis and Candida 
albicans. 
The Committed noted that the Dossier section on concomitant treatments states that overall 19 (27.9%) 
subjects received antifungal drug treatment between EOT and prior to the 6-week follow-up visit. Upon 
request, the MAH clarified that, apart from 31 patients who switched to oral fluconazole as permitted by 
the protocol, most instances in which other systemic antifungal therapies were used were due to 
treatment failures (n=7) and / or discontinuations from treatment (n=4). In addition, 18 subjects did not 
receive any systemic antifungal agent and 4 subjects received systemic antifungal agents other than oral 
fluconazole after completion of IV treatment with anidulafungin.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 72 screened subjects, 4 subjects did not receive study drug and were not included in the safety 
population: 2 subjects (10131001 and 10821001) were screen failures and 2 subjects (10821007 and 
10861001) were not included due to protocol violation (permitted window for prior antifungal therapy had 
elapsed). Of the 68 subjects in the safety population, 64 were included in the MITT population, ie, these 
subjects had received at least 1 dose of study drug and had microbiological confirmation of Candida 
infection. Two subjects (10281002 and 10841002) were excluded from the MITT population when final 
results of their screening cultures did not show growth of Candida spp., rather one culture was positive 
for Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis and the other positive for Malssezia furfur. Two additional subjects 
(10811009 and 10981001) were excluded from the MITT population as they were enrolled under 
Amendment 9 as being at high risk of IC and did not have microbiologically-confirmed ICC. 
The CHMP considered that, within the 9 year period this trial ran for, 72 subjects were screened, 70 were 
included in the study and 68 subjects were treated. Of the 68 subjects who were treated and thus 
included in the safety population, four were removed from the mITT (primary analysis population) as they 
did not have confirmation of invasive candida infection. Approximately half of patients who were screened 
were included in the per protocol population (n=40, 55.6%) reflecting a high rate of protocol deviations 
which is not surprising considering the patient population (see also above for a discussion of protocol 
deviations). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective with relevant secondary outcomes being Global Response 
at EOIVT and subsequent time points, relapse rates (2 & 6 weeks follow up), emerging infection rates (2 
& 6 weeks follow up) and all-cause mortality. PK and exposure-response are discussed elsewhere in this 
AR. Subgroup analyses included examination of response data in various categories, including age group, 
site of infection, Candida spp., and neutropenic status. 
Global response (combination of clinical and microbiological response as assessed by the Investigator) of 
success, failure, or indeterminate at the EOIVT and subsequent time points; 
An overall global response of success was observed in 45 of 64 (70.3%) subjects at EOIVT. Over 90% 
of subjects in the MITT population overall and in each age group had Candida isolated from blood only.  
A sensitivity analysis of global response was performed excluding indeterminate and missing data. In this 
analysis, the success rate overall was 88.2% at EOIVT, 88.5% at EOT, 86.8% at the 2-week follow-up, 
and 81.1% at the 6-week follow-up. 
The Global response of success at EOIVT was 87.5 % (73.2, 95.8) in the PP population.

Global response by age group 
Accounting for the small number of subjects, there were no notable trends with respect to global 
response between age groups. At EOT, the rate of success per age group was similar.

The CHMP noted that the global response rate at end of IV treatment in the overall study population is 
70.3% for the MITT population. Response rates are higher in the per protocol population as well as when 
missing data are disregarded. Response rates are roughly in line with rates seen in adults: in adults with 
ICC the success rate at EOIVT was 76% (88/116), at 2-week FU it was 65% (82/127), an 6-week FU it as 
56% (71/127). 
Relapse rate and all-cause mortality 
Relapse of infection was reported in 3 subjects at the 6-week follow-up visit. No new Candida infections 
were reported for subjects at the 2- and 6-week follow-up visits.  
The overall all-cause mortality rate was 12.5% (8 subjects). While the observed mortality rates were 
varied between age cohorts, a meaningful interpretation is difficult due to the low number of subjects. 
Global Response by site of infection 
Blood Only 
Overall and across all the 3 age groups, the most common sites of infection were blood (n=61, 95.3%) 
and catheter site (n=42, 65.6%). Of the 42 subjects with “catheter site” infection, 41 also had an 
infection site of “blood”. 
For blood only infections, overall global response success rates at the EOIVT and EOT visits were identical 
and observed in 42 (71.2%) subjects. Across the 3 age groups, global response success rates at both 
visits was 9 of 14 (64.3%) subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 13 of 16 (81.3%) subjects in 
the 2 to <5 years age group, and 20 of 29 (69.0%) subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group.

Overall, 12 (20.3%) subjects had an indeterminate response at both EOIVT and EOT, with relatively 
similar proportions across all 3 age groups. 
Among subjects for whom follow-up clinical and microbiological response assessments were available 
(n=59), an overall global response rate of success was observed in 42 (71.2%) subjects at the 2-week 
follow-up, and in 39 (66.1%) subjects at the 6-week follow-up. 
Blood and Other Sterile Sites 
Two subjects had infections in blood and other sterile sites. The overall global response success rate in 
this category at all study visits was 50.0%. One subject (10691001) in the 2 to <5 years age group had 
reported source of infection as blood, eyes, and urinary tract. Though the Investigator assessed this 
subject as a clinical cure and microbiological eradication at EOIVT, the Sponsor assessed the global 
response as failure for all study visits because the Investigator discontinued subject’s study treatment to 
begin fluconazole IV for treatment of Candida albicans in the urine.  
Sterile Sites (Other than Blood Only) 
For infections in sterile sites (other than blood only) the overall global response success rate at EOIVT 
and EOT was 66.7% (2 of 3 subjects) and 100% (3 of 3 subjects), respectively.  
Global Response by Candida spp

The CHMP considered that the failure rates are similar per species, whilst there is some variation in the 
indeterminates. However, numbers per strata are particularly low, no CIs are given and no conclusions 
should be drawn. 
Global Response by neutropenic status 
The overall global response success rate at EOIVT was lower (63.6%) among subjects in the MITT 
population with laboratory-confirmed neutropenia (ANC ≤500 cells/mm3) at baseline (n=11) compared to 
those with ANC >500 cells/mm3. 
The CHMP noted that numbers are low (n=11 vs n=43). Therefore, data should be cautiously interpreted. 
The success rate is numerically lower in patients with neutropenia at baseline. Failure rates are not 
dissimilar. However, numbers are low, confidence intervals have not been computed but are expected to 
be wide. 
Clinical cure 
An overall clinical response of success (cure plus improvement) was observed in 50 of 64 (78.1%) 
subjects at EOIVT, and in 49 of 64 (76.6%) subjects at EOT. Across the 3 age groups, a clinical response 
rate of success ranged from 68.8 to 83.3% at both EOIVT and EOT.

Microbiological Response 
A microbiological response of success (eradication plus presumed eradication) was observed in 54 of 64 
(84.4%) subjects at EOIVT and 56 of 64 (87.5%) subjects at EOT. 
The CHMP noted that Clinical Cure and Microbiological response in the MITT is roughly in line with the 
Global Response.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This single arm prospective set out to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of anidulafungin in children 1 
month to <18 years of age with ICC. The study would have benefitted from a control arm. Objectives and 
endpoints, as defined, are considered appropriate.  
Inclusion criteria were significantly altered during the course of the study however as only 2 subjects 
were recruited under the new inclusion criteria, i.e. being at high risk for ICC without microbiologically 
confirmed ICC, the impact on the conclusions of this study is considered to be minimal. 
Subjects received anidulafungin IV treatment with a 3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Study Day 1 followed by 
1.5 mg/kg maintenance dose daily thereafter IV for a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 35 days. 
There was an option to switch to oral treatment with fluconazole (6 to 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 
mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV treatment. 
Over a 9 year period, 72 patients were screened, 70 were randomised and 68 were treated. Of these, 19 
subjects were in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 19 subjects in the 2 to <5 years age group and 30 
subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group.  
The baseline characteristics of subjects were reflective of a patient population at high risk of ICC with 
high rates of the central catheter and broad spectrum antibiotic use, total parenteral nutrition, underlying 
malignancy, and chemotherapy. The most commonly reported baseline pathogens in the MITT population 
included Candida albicans (39.1%), Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), and Candida tropicalis (14.1%). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The overall global response success rates in the MITT population at End of IV treatment were 70.3% 
(95% CI: 57.6, 81.1) at EOIVT. Success rates were slightly higher in the PP population. Response rates 
are roughly in line with rates seen in adults: in adults with ICC the success rate at EOIVT was 76% 
(88/116), at 2-week FU it was 65% (82/127), a 6-week FU it as 56% (71/127). 
As over 90% of subjects in the MITT population had Candida isolated from blood only, global response 
rates in subjects with candidemia (blood only infections) were similar to the overall population at all time 
points. Success rates at EOIVT were slightly lower (63.6%) in patients with neutropenia at baseline than 
patients without neutropenia at baseline, however this is based upon 11 subjects only.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although data are limited, overall the data provided by study A8851008 suggest that the efficacy in 
paediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years with ICC can be expected to be largely in line with the 
efficacy observed in adults.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In adults, the safety profile of anidulafungin in patients with invasive candidaemia was found to be 
comparable to fluconazole, with higher rates of respiratory distress and dyspnoe. Infusion-related adverse 
reactions have been reported with anidulafungin in clinical studies, including rash, pruritus dyspnoea, 
bronchospasm, hypotension (common events), flushing, hot flush and urticaria (uncommon events). 
Increased levels of hepatic enzymes have been seen in healthy subjects and patients treated with 
anidulafungin. In some patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving multiple 
concomitant medicines along with anidulafungin, clinically significant hepatic abnormalities have occurred. 
Cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure were uncommon in clinical trials. 
Patients with increased hepatic enzymes during anidulafungin therapy should be monitored for evidence 
of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing anidulafungin therapy. 
Patient exposure 
Of the 72 screened subjects, 4 subjects did not receive study drug and were not included in the safety 
population: the safety population included 19 subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 19 subjects 
in the 2 to <5 years age group and 30 subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group. 
The median duration of anidulafungin treatment for the overall safety population was 11 days. Of the 68 
subjects, 31 subjects were switched to receive treatment with fluconazole for a median duration of 8 
days. The total median duration of overall treatment (anidulafungin plus fluconazole) was 17 days.

Adverse events 
There were 422 treatment emergent adverse events reported in 66 subjects. A total of 45 treatment-
related AEs were reported in 21 (30.9%) subjects. No notable trends were observed across the 3 age 
groups with regard to overall AEs.  
The 3 most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (n=16, 23.5%), diarrhoea (n=15, 22.1%), and 
pyrexia (n=13, 19.1%). The most commonly reported TEAEs reported in the Investigations SOC were 
increased ALT (n=7, 10.3%), increased AST (n=5, 7.4%), and transaminases increased (n=4, 5.9%).

Overall, 3 (15.8%) subjects in the 1 month to <2 years age group, 4 (21.1%) subjects in the 2 to <5 
years age group, and 14 (46.7%) subjects in the 5 to <18 years age group experienced an anidulafungin-
related TEAE. While the proportion of TEAEs was higher in the oldest age group; overall, no notable 
trends were identified between age groups. 
The majority of TEAEs were not considered treatment-related; a total of 45 treatment-related TEAEs 
(attributed to either anidulafungin or fluconazole) were reported in 21 (30.9%) subjects.  
The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs attributed to anidulafungin were diarrhoea (4 
subjects, 5.9%), vomiting, pyrexia, increased ALT, and increased AST (each reported by 3 subjects, 
4.4%). With the exception of diarrhoea, vomiting, and pyrexia, no other anidulafungin related TEAEs 
were reported by more than 1 subject within an age group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 58/82 
 
 
  
  
 
A total of 7 (10.3%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs; 6 subjects discontinued anidulafungin 
and 1 subject discontinued fluconazole. Six TEAEs (diarrhea, vomiting, increased ALT, increased AST, 
generalized pruritus, and increased transaminases), experienced by 5 subjects, were considered by the 
Investigator to be related to study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 59/82 
 
 
  
  
 
All of these resolved with the exception of 1 event of increased transaminases; this event and other 
hepatobiliary AEs of interest are discussed below. Three TEAEs were considered severe and were also 
reported as SAEs. 
Adverse events of Special Interest 
The AEs of special interest for anidulafungin (hepatobiliary events, convulsions, QT prolongation/ 
Torsades de Pointes, anaphylaxis, infusion-related reactions, and anesthetic exacerbation of infusion-
related reactions) were determined in accordance with the anidulafungin risk management plan and the 
safety review plan. These events were programmatically assessed based on pre-defined standard 
MedDRA queries (SMQs) and AE PTs (MedDRA, Version 20.1), and are summarized overall in Table 5.

Anaphylaxis 
Although the incidence of anaphylaxis appears artificially high, the search criteria, SMQs, broad and 
narrow (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema), and preferred terms (infusion-related reaction, hot flush, 
chills, dizziness, feeling hot, and hyperhidrosis), were used to identify cases potentially indicating 
anaphylaxis. Overall, 24 (35.3%) subjects experienced events potentially indicating anaphylaxis that 
were reported due to the wide search criteria used to identify all possible events. Following review of 
these events, no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis were reported for anidulafungin-treated subjects. 
Hepatobiliary Events 
The incidence of hepatobiliary disorder events is summarized in Table 31. Overall, 16 (23.5%) subjects 
experienced hepatic-related AEs (in the SOCs of Hepatobiliary disorders, Infections and infestations, 
Investigations, and Metabolism and nutrition disorders). The majority of events were mild to moderate in 
severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 60/82 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Most events were reported in the Investigations SOC; study drug was permanently discontinued for 3 
subjects who experienced 4 hepatobiliary events (transaminases increased, ALT increased, and AST 
increased).  
Three subjects were reported to have severe hepatic-related AEs. Increased ALT and AST was assessed 
as severe for 1 subject in the 1 month to <2 year age group, and hyperbilirubinemia and transaminases 
increased were assessed as severe for 1 subject each in the 5 to <18 years age group. Of these, one 
hepatobiliary event (Subject 10811006, see below under SAEs) was reported as an SAE. 
The CHMP noted that increased levels of hepatic enzymes were observed in healthy volunteers. 
Significant hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure has been observed in clinical trials in adult 
patients treated with anidulafungin. In the present study, 23.5% of paediatric patients experienced a 
hepatic related AE which appears to be more frequent than is observed in adults (in adults reported 
1/100 to 1/10). The MAH was asked to comment on the seemingly higher frequency of hepatic AEs in 
paediatric patients.  
With their response, rates of hepatobiliary AEs in different SOCs and by PT as reported in the paediatric 
and adult patient population were provided: 
• Cholestasis is listed as “Common”, reflecting a frequency in the adult study population (840 subjects) of 
1.0%. One paediatric patient was reported with this event, representing 1.5% of the study population. 
• ALT increased is listed as “Common” reflecting a frequency in adults of 2.0%. In the paediatric study, 7 
patients were reported with this event, representing 10.3% of the population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 61/82 
 
 
  
  
 
• AST increased is listed as “Common” reflecting a frequency in adults of 1.9%. In the paediatric study, 5 
patients were reported with this event, representing 7.4% of the population. 
• Blood bilirubin increased is listed as “Common” reflecting a frequency in adults of 1.0%. In the 
paediatric study, 3 patients were reported with this event, representing 4.4% of the population. 
• Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased is listed as “Uncommon” reflecting a frequency in adults of 
0.8%. In the paediatric study, 2 patients were reported with this event, representing 2.9% of the 
population. 
The MAH also provided a discussion of the hepatobiliary adverse events in the paediatric population as 
compared to the adult population and highlighted that study A8851008 enrolled only small numbers of 
patients making assessment of frequencies of adverse events inaccurate. The limited number of 
paediatric patients included in clinical studies to date is acknowledged. The uncertainties surrounding the 
frequency of specific events due to this limited number are also acknowledged. 
The MAH furthermore provided information on the individual cases of hepatobiliary ADRs which suggests 
that in several cases at least the events were not related due to lack of temporal relationship or due to 
values returning to normal whilst still on anidulafungin. This may also be the case, however, for adults.  
Based on the above, the CHMP recommended the following wording for Section 4.8: 
“The safety of anidulafungin was investigated in 68 paediatric patients (1 month to <18 years) with ICC 
in a prospective, open-label, non-comparative paediatric study (see section 5.1). The frequencies of 
certain hepatobiliary adverse events, including “ALT increased” and “AST increased” appeared at a higher 
frequency (7-10%) in these paediatric patients than has been observed in adults (2%). Due to the limited 
size of the study this could be due to chance or differences in underlying disease severity.” 
The Committee agreed that no changes in the frequencies of the hepatic-related ADRs are needed, as the 
frequency classification would alter for two ADRs, of which one is borderline and the second is based on 
only 2 cases.  
Finally, the CHMP agreed that the benefit-risk profile is also not significantly affected by the hepatic 
adverse events and remains positive, with significant benefits for paediatric patients and an acceptable 
risk. 
Adverse Events in Paediatric Subjects Enrolled in Other Studies 
Adverse events from 2 clinical studies involving paediatric subjects who were administered anidulafungin 
are summarized below.  
Study VER001 (Duke University study) 
This was a prospective, open-label, single centre, pharmacokinetic study of anidulafungin in 15 infants 
(age range 50-451 days) and neonates (age range 2-28 days) less than 24 months of age with suspected 
serious infection. Subjects received anidulafungin 3 mg/kg loading dose on day 1 of study and 1.5 mg/kg 
every 24 hours on study days 2-5. The maximum loading dose did not exceed 200 mg and the 
maintenance dose 100 mg/day 
In this study, AEs were experienced by 8 of 15 subjects, including 3 infants and 5 neonates. There was no 
discernible pattern of toxicity with respect to AE severity, relatedness, toxicity grade, deaths, SAEs, or 
AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. All AEs were considered by the investigator to be unrelated 
to anidulafungin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 62/82 
 
 
  
  
 
The most commonly reported AE was worsening hyperbilirubinemia (2 subjects). These 2 AEs of 
hyperbilirubinemia were considered unrelated to anidulafungin and were observed in the infant group. 
The 2 subjects who experienced hyperbilirubinemia, however, had prior episodes before the start of study 
drug. 
Study VER002-12 
Study VER002-12 was a Phase 1/2 study of the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin; 
25 immunocompromised paediatric subjects with neutropenia aged 2 to 17 years (inclusive) were 
enrolled. This study is described in Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the current, approved 
ECALTA SmPC. AEs were experienced by all subjects. Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. Four 
subjects experienced 6 AEs considered to be possibly or probably related to study drug by investigator 
attribution. None of these AEs were serious or led to study drug withdrawal. The most common AE, 
experienced by 11 (44.0%) subjects, was pyrexia. Other common AEs experienced by at least 5 (20.0%) 
patients were mucosal inflammation, graft versus host disease, and vomiting (6 [24.0%] subjects each) 
and cough, hypertension, and hypomagnesemia (5 [20.0%] subjects each). Study drug was discontinued 
in 3 subjects because of AEs, none of which was attributed to study drug by the investigator. There were 
no drug-related SAEs. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 30 (44.1%) subjects and 3 of these were considered related 
to study drug anidulafungin. 
•  Subject 10681001, a 17-year old Asian male with underlying history of acute lymphocytic leukemia 
and multiple other reported conditions, including thrombocytopenia, experienced an SAE of 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage on Day 15 which was assessed as severe. The subject’s last dose of 
anidulafungin was on Day 12; fluconazole was administered until Day 16. The subject died due to 
sepsis on Day 18. 
•  Subject 10811006, a 5-year old male of other race, was treated with anidulafungin from Day 1 to 10, 
and experienced an AE of severe transaminases increased which was assessed as an SAE. On Day 1, 
the subject experienced an SAE of severe medulloblastoma disease progression, with documented 
tumor progression on MRI. During enrolment, multiple AEs were reported, including, among others: 
bradycardia (Days 2 and 4), pyrexia (Day 2 to 10), tachypnea and respiratory disorder (Day 3 to 4); 
scrotal edema (Day 5 onward), penile edema (Day 7 onward), and dyspnea (Day 8 to 10, following a 
tracheostomy on Day 6 to replace endotracheal intubation from Day -2). On Day 10, the subject 
developed severe transaminases increased, which was also considered an SAE and was assessed 
by the Investigator as related to anidulafungin; this event resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
study drug. Other AEs reported as of Day 10 included pupil fixed, areflexia, and epistaxis. The 
subject died on Day 12. The cause of death, as assessed by the Investigator, was attributed to 
medulloblastoma disease progression.  
•  Subject 10821008, a 3-month old white female with a prior history of gastrointestinal obstruction, 
experienced an SAE of diarrhoea (Day 1), which was assessed as severe and resulted in 
discontinuation of study drug. The event was reported as resolved on Day 6. No other SAEs were 
assessed as related to either anidulafungin or fluconazole treatment. The majority of SAEs reported 
had an outcome of recovered/resolved. 
Deaths 
A total of 10 death cases were reported to the Sponsor; 1 occurred during the active treatment phase, 7 
occurred during the post-treatment (follow-up) phase, and 2 occurred post-treatment outside of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 63/82 
 
 
  
  
safety reporting period (after the 6-week follow-up visit). For the 8 deaths that occurred during the study 
reporting period, Investigators specified the cause of death on the CRF as related to one of the following: 
(1) death from infection under study; (2) death unrelated to infection under study, but infection was still 
current; or (3) death unrelated to infection under study and no evidence of infection at time of death.  
None of the deaths were assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug. One death was assessed 
by the Investigator to be related to the infection under study: 
•  Subject 10681002, a 7-year old Asian male, discontinued anidulafungin after 1 dose due to a 
treatment-related AE of pruritus generalized. The subject then started IV fluconazole and later 
micafungin; the subject died of septic shock on Day 20. 
The remaining 7 deaths were assessed as related to other conditions: intracranial hemorrhage, 
sepsis/septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, progression of 
medulloblastoma, and multi-organ failure (metachromatic leukodystrophy. 
In the 2 subjects with death related to sepsis/septic shock, the Investigators assessed the deaths as 
unrelated to the infection under study, but infection was still current. 
•  Subject 10811001, a 3-year old male of other race died of septic shock on Day 1. Septic shock is 
noted as present medical history at baseline. The causality of death in the CRF is noted as "Other 
illness-previous septic shock due to neutropenia, which was caused by previous chemotherapy 
treatment."  
Subject 10681001, a 17-year old Asian male, died of sepsis (on Day 18; causality was reported as being 
related to acute lymphocytic leukemia). The subject's baseline blood culture was positive for Candida 
tropicalis; however, all subsequent blood cultures were negative for Candida spp. On Day 16, a blood 
culture was positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 
Laboratory findings 
The majority of individual clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were in haematological parameters 
(eg, neutropenia, differential cell count percentages), which were most often observed in the context of 
acute illness (eg, sepsis) or underlying malignancy based on clinical review of subjects’ medical history. 
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to hepatobiliary parameters are described below. 
Of the 17 subjects who met laboratory abnormality criteria for AST, 2 subjects (10681001 and 10811006) 
had elevated AST values that did not return to baseline or normal range. 
Eighteen subjects met laboratory abnormality criteria for ALT. Of these, 1 subject (10810006) had 
elevated ALT values that did not return to baseline or normal range. 
•  Subject 10681001, a 17-year old Asian male, experienced non-serious AEs of moderate ALT increased 
and mild AST increased on Day 3. The AEs were considered related to anidulafungin treatment and 
resolved on Day 16. A non-serious mild AE of hyperbilirubinemia was reported on Day 16, considered 
unrelated, and was ongoing at the time of the subject’s death due to sepsis (on Day 18; causality was 
reported as being related to acute lymphocytic leukemia).  
•  Subject 10811006, a 5-year old male of other race, experienced a severe SAE of transaminases 
increased as discussed above.  
Eleven subjects met laboratory abnormality criteria for total bilirubin. Of these, 2 subjects (10681001, 
10681002) had elevated values that had not returned to baseline or normal range by the final study visit.  
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 64/82 
 
 
  
  
Two subjects (10271002 and 10651006) had ALT and AST elevations >10 × ULN during the treatment 
period which required discontinuation of study drug. AST values in both subjects normalized by the final 
study visit. One subject (10811006) had ALT elevation >10 × ULN during treatment and was 
discontinued from study drug. 
•  Subject 10271002, a 28-month old white female, had elevated ALT and AST values at Screening that 
trended upward until peaking to 1082 IU/L and 840 IU/L, respectively, on Day 4. Non-serious, 
moderate AEs of ALT increased and AST increased were reported; these AEs were considered related 
to anidulafungin treatment and the subject was discontinued from study drug. The events were 
considered resolved on Day 41.  
•  Subject 10651006, a 20-month old white male, had relevant medical history of ALT increased and 
AST increased, both present at Screening. On Day 7, ALT and AST for Subject 10651006 sharply 
increased to 666 IU/L and 664 IU/L, respectively, both values being >11 × ULN. Severe AEs of ALT 
increased and AST increased were reported; however, the Investigator continued anidulafungin 
treatment and reported causality related to chemotherapy vincristine plus daunorubicine (cytolytic 
action on hepatocytes) given prior to Screening. On Day 11, AST had decreased to within normal 
limits; the associated severe AE improved to moderate on Day 12, and the moderate AE resolved on 
Day 19. On Day 57, ALT had decreased to within normal limits; the associated severe AE was 
considered resolved. The subject continued anidulafungin treatment until Day 16 with no further 
elevation in LFTs. 
•  Subject 10811006, a 5-year old male of other race, had transaminases in the normal range during 
the study until a sudden increase of ALT and AST values to 1887 IU/L and 2329 IU/L, respectively, on 
Day 10. A severe SAE of transaminases increased was reported. The event was considered related to 
anidulafungin treatment and resulted in discontinuation of study drug on Day 10. This subject died 
due to medulloblastoma disease progression on Day 12.  
A total of 3 subjects met biochemical criteria for Hy’s law, according to the laboratory criteria and were 
assessed for potential Hy’s law cases. In all 3 cases, abnormalities were either reported at baseline or a 
co-morbid medical condition that could possibly account for the abnormal hepatic enzyme values was 
reported. In 2 of the 3 subjects (10491002 and 10791002), the abnormal LFT values were noted at 
baseline and were attributed to other causes. 
•  Subject 10491002, a 17-year old white female, had baseline LFT elevations attributed to concomitant 
medications; ALT, AST, and total bilirubin all improved during the period of treatment with 
anidulafungin. 
•  Subject 10791002, a 4-year old white female, had an underlying condition of cholelithiasis, requiring 
cholecystectomy (surgery had been planned prior to study enrollment).  
Subject 10441001, a 16-year old Asian female, had elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin 
beginning on Day 3; this subject experienced an AE of liver abscess due to candidiasis (disease under 
study). ALT and AST values both normalized by EOIVT and total bilirubin values improved after Day 7 and 
normalized by the 6-week follow-up visit. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, seven (10.3%) subjects discontinued due to treatment emergent adverse events. Six subjects 
discontinued anidulafungin and 1 subject discontinued fluconazole. Six TEAEs (diarrhoea, vomiting, 
increased ALT, increased AST, generalized pruritus, and increased transaminases), experienced by 5 
subjects, were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug.

All of these resolved with the exception of a severe AE of increased transaminases which is discussed 
under SAEs.  
Post-marketing experience 
It is estimated that 801,962 patients were exposed to anidulafungin worldwide since the product was first 
approved through 15 October 2018. 
Table. Post-marketing Patient Exposure by Age Group, Gender, and Region through 15 October 2018 
The MAH estimated that over 800,000 patients have been exposed to anidulafungin. This includes, 
according to the table above a significant number of children. It was noted that the estimated exposure 
pattern in males and females for the age groups 0-17 and 18-29 is, however, striking. It is not entirely 
clear what the source of the imbalance in exposure between males and females is as the unavailability of 
the gender and age data for the latest AMR metrics would not expected to lead to an imbalance per se 
but rather would result in the data being presented differently, i.e. not by sex. In any case, this does not 
impact the B/R assessment for this application. Furthermore, the method of calculation for the post-
marketing exposure has been accepted in previous assessments of PSURs and is still considered 
acceptable. Therefore, no further action is warranted. 
The MAHs safety database was searched to identify post-marketing (PM) sourced adverse events (AEs) 
for paediatric patients receiving anidulafungin. Cumulatively, a total of 1127 cases (1638 AEs) were 
received from spontaneous sources through the cutoff date of 15 October 2018. Among the total PM 
cases, 32 cases (56 AEs) representing 2.8% of total PM cases involved paediatric patients (less than or 
equal to 17 years). 
The adverse events reported more than once were as follows: Product use issue (10), Pyrexia (5), Drug 
administered to patient of inappropriate age, Off label use and Respiratory disorder (3 each), 
Anaphylactic shock, Drug ineffective, Metabolic acidosis, Rash and Transaminases increased (2 each). 
Overall, the cumulative review of PM paediatric cases did not show any new significant safety findings. 
Based upon routine post-marketing pharmacovigilance monitoring, there are no new emerging safety 
concerns identified in this dataset.

Cases in Neonates (Aged 0 to 27 Days) 
There were 3 cases reported in neonates, 2 of which were serious. 
•  Serious case #1 (Case ID 2011111143): A neonate patient of unspecified age who received 
anidulafungin at an unknown dosage for Candida infection and experienced on an unknown date 
Transaminases increased and Blood bilirubin increased (clinical outcome: resolved for both the AEs). 
Assessment report

After discharge from hospital and anidulafungin treatment ending, the patient reported Pyrexia and 
White blood cell count decreased (time to events onset and clinical outcome for both the AEs were 
unknown). Of note before anidulafungin treatment, the patient received amphotericin B for Candida 
infection and had neutropenia and thrombocytopenia due to the infection. 
•  Serious case #2 (Case ID 2011303778): A premature male neonate (32 week of pregnancy) with 
systemic Candida, who experienced an AE of Liver function test abnormal during treatment with 
anidulafungin (1.5 mg/kg/day, IV) administered for 3 weeks and amphotericin B (co-suspect). On the 
10th day of treatment with anidulafungin, blood cultures were negative and clinical and laboratory 
picture of the neonate was gradually improved. 
• 
The non-serious case (Case ID 2016431166) reported the PT Product use issue with no co-reported 
AEs. 
Cases in Infants (Aged 28 Days to 23 Months) 
There were 5 cases reported in infants, 2 of which were serious. 
•  Serious case #1 (Case ID 2008152895): An 8-month-old female patient who received anidulafungin. 
The patient had a medical history of hepatic failure and positive Candida results. Since the patient 
had to be admitted for a liver transplant, she was transferred to the reporter hospital (the date of the 
liver transplant was unknown). When she was on the 5th day of anidulafungin treatment, she 
experienced metabolic acidosis. Anidulafungin treatment was permanently discontinued on unknown 
date. Patient recovered from the event 48 hours later. 
•  Serious case #2 (Case ID 2016551711): A 7-month-old patient who received anidulafungin on an 
unknown date and at an unspecified dosage. The patient experienced Oxygen saturation decreased, 
Tachycardia, Tachypnea, Cyanosis, Pallor, Pigmentation disorder, and Pyrexia on an unspecified date 
with unknown outcome.  
• 
The 3 non-serious cases reported the PTs Product use issue (Case ID: 2013072867 and 2015236002) 
and Drug ineffective (Case ID: 2016435011) with no co-reported events.

Warnings are included in the SmPC to address the risk of hepatic effects, anaphylactic reactions and

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The median duration of anidulafungin treatment for the overall safety population was 11 days. Of the 68 
subjects, 31 subjects were switched to receive treatment with fluconazole for a median duration of 8 
days. The total median duration of overall treatment (anidulafungin plus fluconazole) was 17 days. 
The 3 most commonly reported TEAEs were vomiting (n=16, 23.5%), diarrhoea (n=15, 22.1%), and 
pyrexia (n=13, 19.1%). Increased ALT and increased AST was reported by 10.3% (n=7) and 7.4% (n=5) 
of subjects, respectively. A total of 7 (10.3%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs. 
Transaminases increased was reported by 5.9%(n=4) of subjects. The most commonly reported 
treatment-related TEAEs attributed to anidulafungin were diarrhoea (4 subjects, 5.9%), vomiting, 
pyrexia, increased ALT, and increased AST (each reported by 3 subjects, 4.4%). In adults too most 
commonly reported adverse drug reactions include gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhoea 
and vomiting. The study was too small to inform adverse reactions occurring less frequently than roughly 
1 in 10 paediatric subjects. There were no clear age-related patterns in the safety however, numbers in 
different age strata are low. 
As seen in the adult patient population, a relatively high proportion of subjects reported hepatic related 
AEs (23.5%) in this paediatric study. Three subjects were reported to have severe hepatic-related AEs. 
Study drug was permanently discontinued for 3 subjects who experienced 4 hepatobiliary events 
(transaminases increased, ALT increased, and AST increased). In addition, three subjects experienced 
either AST or ALT elevations which did not return to baseline or normal range and two subjects 
experienced increased bilirubin levels that had not returned to baseline/normal levels. Based on the 
available data, the risk of hepatic AEs appears higher in paediatric patients, the MAH is requested to 
discuss this and discuss the consequences for the B/R. Also, additional analyses of the relationship 
between anidulafungin exposure and the occurrence of clinically significant abnormalities in relation to 
hepatobiliary parameters and between exposure and the occurrence of treatment-emergent increases in 
hepatic enzymes were provided (see section 2.3.5). 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 30 (44.1%) subjects. There were 3 SAEs considered related 
to study drug anidulafungin (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic enzymes increased, diarrhoea); there

were 10 deaths of which none were considered related to treatment, and one was considered related to 
ICC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Although limited, the data provided by study A8851008 suggest that the safety in paediatric patients 
aged 1 month to 18 years with ICC is largely in line with the safety profile seen in adults, with some 
indication that there may be increased hepatobiliary adverse reactions. Adequate wording has been 
added to Section 4.8 of the SmPC to inform prescribers about this. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 13.0 (data lock point 15 October 2018, dated 08 March 
2019) with this application for requesting the extended indication to paediatric patients ≥ 1 month of age 
following completion of study A8851008 (EMEA/H/000788/P46/046). The list of safety concerns were 
revised based on study A8851008 completion and in line with the GVP Module V (Rev. 2) and the

Safety concerns considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP (newly added indicated in blue font) 
Risks and missing 
Risk-benefit impact 
information 
Important potential risks 
Hepatic impairment and other 
Given the potential risk of hepatotoxicity associated with 
serious toxicities in neonates < 
polysorbate 80 when an increased amount is used in neonates, 
1 month of age 
there is a theoretical risk of additive or synergistic hepatic effects in 
neonates when exposed to anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 at 
higher doses. Neonatal exposure to an increased amount of 
polysorbate 80 in addition to an increased dose of anidulafungin 
resulted from the clinical need to use higher doses of anidulafungin 
to cover documented or suspected Candida meningitis. The 
proposed label includes a warning about the treatment with 
anidulafungin in neonates (<1 month old). 
Missing information 
Pregnant women 
Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical studies. There are 
no adequate or well-controlled data regarding the use of 
anidulafungin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity. Therefore, the product label advises that 
anidulafungin is not recommended during pregnancy unless the 
benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
Resistance 
The efficacy of anidulafungin can be limited against certain species 
of fungi. Patients with resistant forms of infection may fail to 
respond to therapy. No indication from the community or the clinical 
setting that warrants change to the use of anidulafungin when used 
appropriately as prescribed in the label. Emerging antifungal 
resistance will continue to be kept under close surveillance. 
SVII.2. New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP 
The MAH proposed to reclassify the important identified risks ‘Anaphylaxis and Infusion-associated 
reactions’, ‘Hepatobiliary events’ and ‘Convulsions’ as identified risks that are not considered important 
for inclusion in the RMP, in accordance with GVP Module V (Rev 2), and therefore to remove from the list 
of safety concerns. The rationales (summarized) for the proposed changes to the list of safety concerns 
are briefly presented below. 
The MAH proposed to reclassify the important potential risks ‘Exacerbation of Infusion-associated 
reactions by anaesthetics’ and ‘QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes’ as potential risks that are not 
considered important for inclusion in the RMP, therefore to remove from the list of safety concerns. 
The MAH proposed to remove the Missing Information (MI) ‘Children/Adolescents’ and to add the 
important potential risk ‘Hepatic impairment and other serious toxicities in neonates < 1 month of age’ 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020 
Page 73/82 
 
 
  
  
based on the completion of Study A8851008. In addition, the missing information ‘Elderly’ is proposed for 
removal from the list of safety concerns in accordance with GVP Module V (Rev 2). 
Important Identified Risks removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
Anaphylaxis and Infusion-associated reactions 
The MAH considerd it is an adverse reaction already well-known to health professionals, the event does 
not require additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures, and it has no 
impact on public health. The SmPC (section 4.2) provides instruction to minimize the potential for 
infusion-associated reactions. In addition, after over 12 years of post-marketing experience, no 
significant safety issues have been identified. 
Hepatobiliary events 
The MAH reclassified this risk as not important as it does not require additional pharmacovigilance 
activities or additional risk minimisation measures. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is considered 
part of standard clinical practice in the patient population likely to receive anidulafungin given the 
indication (ICC [Invasive Candidiasis/Candidaemia]) and the risk factors for ICC. SmPC section 4.4 
recommends dosage adjustments if LFTs worsen during treatment. 
Convulsions 
The MAH reclassified this risk as not important as it does not require additional pharmacovigilance 
activities or additional risk minimisation measures, and it has a low impact on public health. 
Important Potential Risks removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
Exacerbation of Infusion-associated reactions by anaesthetics 
The MAH reclassified this risk as not important as it does not require additional pharmacovigilance 
activities or additional risk minimisation measures, and it has a low impact on public health. No cases 
were identified in the clinical programme or in the safety database after 12 years of post-marketing 
experience. 
QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes 
The MAH reclassified this risk as not important as it does not require additional pharmacovigilance 
activities or additional risk minimisation measures, and it has a low impact on public health. After 12 
years of post-marketing experience no safety issues concerning this risk have been identified. 
The MAH’s proposal to remove the important identified risks ‘Anaphylaxis and Infusion-associated 
reactions’, ‘Hepatobiliary events’ and ‘Convulsions’ from the summary of safety concerns as well as the 
rationales for the proposed changes was endorsed by the PRAC. Routine risk minimisation measures are 
in place to sufficiently address the risks of ‘Anaphylaxis and Infusion-associated reactions’ and 
‘Hepatobiliary events’. ‘Convulsion’ is included as an adverse drug reaction in SmPC section 4.8. In 
addition, routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to further characterise these risks.  
The MAH’s proposal to remove the important potential risks ‘Exacerbation of Infusion-associated reactions 
by anaesthetics’ and ‘QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes’ from the summary of safety concerns was 
endorsed. In the last PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000215/201701), covering the period 01 February 
2014 to 31 January 2017, no cases concerning the risks ‘Exacerbation of infusion-associated reactions by 
anaesthetics’, and ‘QT prolongation/Torsade de Pointes’ were received. Routine pharmacovigilance is 
sufficient to characterise these risks. 
Important Potential Risks added to the List of Safety Concerns

EMA/304231/2020

Hepatic impairment and other serious toxicities in neonates (< 1 month of age) 
The MAH considers the classification of ‘children/adolescents’ as missing information is no longer 
appropriate based on the availability of new data following completion of study A8851008. Neonates 
under 1 month of age have been excluded from the clinical program as the use of anidulafungin in this 
population may present a different safety profile and therefore warrant remaining among the safety 
concerns. Therefore, the MAH proposed to add the important potential risk ‘Hepatic impairment and other 
serious toxicities in neonates < 1 month of age’ because of potential toxicity of the excipient polysorbate 
80 (PS80) resulting from the higher doses that would be needed for the treatment of invasive candidiasis 
with CNS involvement in this patient population. 
The MAH’s proposal to add the important potential risk ‘Hepatic impairment and other serious toxicities in 
neonates < 1 month of age’ was endorsed by the PRAC. Anidulafungin is indicated in paediatric patients 
from 1 month of age, however, a potential different safety profile can be expected in this potential target 
population due to higher doses. A warning for treatment with the product in neonates (<1 month old) is 
included in SmPC section 4.4. In addition, routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient to further 
characterize this risk in this patient population.  
Missing information removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
Children/Adolescents 
The MAH proposes to remove ‘Children/Adolescents’ classified as missing information based on 
completion of study A8851008. Safety data is available from this study and include 68 patients between 
the ages of 1 month and < 18 years. Overall, the adverse events (AEs) reported were in line with the 
known safety profile of anidulafungin or the pattern of events expected for the patient population. No new 
safety concerns were identified in this patient population. 
Elderly 
The MAH proposes to remove ‘Elderly’ classified as missing information because there is no evidence that 
the safety profile in this population would differ from the known safety profile of the product. No 
additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures are required. 
The MAH proposes the following safety concerns remain as Missing information: 
Pregnant women 
Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical studies. There is limited post-marketing experience in 
pregnant women. There are no adequate or well-controlled data regarding the use of anidulafungin in 
pregnant women. Foetal toxicity may be experienced if pregnant women are treated with anidulafungin. 
Resistance 
The efficacy of anidulafungin can be limited against certain species of fungi. Patients with resistant forms 
of infection may fail to respond to therapy. 
The MAH’s proposal to remove ‘Children/Adolescents’ and ‘Elderly’ classified as missing information was 
agreed upon by the PRAC. The limited data provided by study A8851008 suggests that the safety profile 
of the product in the paediatric population is largely in line with the safety profile of anidulafungin in 
adults, although some clarifications are needed before this conclusion can be conclusively drawn, and/or 
the events are considered to be related to the underlying disease. In the last PSUSA, covering the period 
01 February 2014 to 31 January 2017, no new safety information was identified by evaluation of post-
marketing data for use of the product in elderly. 
The MAH’s proposal to keep ‘Pregnant women’ and ‘Resistance’ as missing information was not endorsed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/304231/2020

SmPC section 4.6 currently states that Anidulafungin is not recommended during pregnancy unless the 
benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risks to the foetus which routine risk minimisation 
measure is considered sufficient. In addition, routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and 
characterise this risk. 
Resistance constitutes an efficacy concern, not a safety concern, and should therefore be removed from 
the summary of safety concerns. Trends and patterns in Resistance should continue to be monitored in 
PSURs. 
Accordingly, the MAH submitted the updated RMP version 13.1, with DLP of 15 October 2018 and date of 
final sign off of 3 December 2019, in which “Pregnant women” and “Resistance” were removed from the 
list of safety concerns:

since last RMP submission. There are no planned category 3 studies. 
The PRAC considered that Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of 
the product. 
PART IV 
PLANS FOR POST-AUTHORISATION EFFICACY STUDIES 
There are no post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) that are a specific obligation by the competent 
authorities and/or condition of the MA. 
The PRAC noted the above and agreed. Notably, in the previously approved RMP (version 12.1), study 
A8851008 was included as a PAES in the RMP.

EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
The product information and labelling (SmPC) submitted within this application is updated based on the 
data from Study A8851008 and is expected to be sufficient for risk minimisation for all safety concerns. 
The MAH states that routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety concerns of 
Ecalta. No additional risk minimisation measures are proposed. 
The PRAC considered that the proposed routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the 
risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
2.7.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. Version 13.1 is being approved with this procedure. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this new indication, section 4.1 of the SmPC is being updated to reflect the experience and 
recommendations for use in paediatric patients.  
Consequently, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated in order to add 
paediatric dosing instructions, warnings and precautions, clinical, and non-clinical information. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Changes are also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current excipient’s guideline for fructose. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Invasive candidiasis mostly affects critically ill and immunocompromised patients. Candidemia is the most 
common form of invasive candidiasis and is a leading cause of invasive fungal infections in hospitalized 
children. Immunosuppressed children, children in intensive care units, children with central venous 
catheters, and neonates are most at risk for the development of candidemia.  
The most prevalent Candida spp isolated from patients as infectious agents include C. albicans, C. 
glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. During the past 10 years, C. auris has become 
increasingly important as isolates cause serious infections, are often multidrug resistant, can be 
associated with outbreaks in health care facilities, and can be misidentified. The distribution of Candida 
spp causing invasive candidiasis varies geographically and temporally, but also can vary by age. Large 
Assessment report

international collaborative studies which assessed the distribution of fungal pathogens in children found a 
predominance of non-albicans Candida spp in paediatric (56%) and neonatal (52%) patients (Warris et 
al. Curr Fungal Infect Rep 2016; 10:7–9.). Whilst C. parapsilosis causes 30% of the candidemia cases 
among newborns the rate in adults is 10%–15% (Yapar, Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2014; 10: 95–105).  
Incidence rates for Candida spp. vary according to study design and reporting methods: 0.06 to 0.3 per 
1000 inpatient-days (median age: 50 months) in a case-control study; 0.28 per 1000 patient-days in 
another case-control study in premature infants and children up to age 17 years; and 0.81 per 1000 
admissions in a prospective surveillance study. 
A decline in paediatric candidemia in Europe and the US during the last decade has been reported (Walsh 
et al, 2019, J. Fungi 2019, 5, 11; doi:10.3390/jof5010011; Pana et al. Journal of the Paediatric Infectious 
Diseases Society 2017;6(S1):S3–11).  
Mortality for paediatric candidemia is estimated at 22% in the USA, with the highest mortality in 
paediatrics related to Candida albicans at 29%. In older children mortality rates range from 10% to 25% 
in most reports and reach higher rates in patients admitted to the PICU. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current approved treatments for infections due to Candida spp. include echinocandins, polyenes, and the 
azole antifungal agents. The Infectious Disease Society of America and European Society of Clinical 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines for the prevention and treatment of IC in children 
primarily rely on extrapolation from adult studies, as safety and efficacy data for antifungal agents in 
paediatric patients are lacking. According to these guidelines, the first choice treatment for candidemia or 
(suspected) candidiasis is either an echinocandin or lipid formulation of amphotericin B, with fluconazole 
or voriconazole as an alternative. Transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole (usually within 5–7 
days) is recommended for patients who are clinically stable, have isolates that are susceptible to 
fluconazole (e.g.: C. albicans), and have negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal 
therapy. 
In Europe, caspofungin acetate is indicated for 12 months of age and older, as safety and efficacy of 
caspofungin have not been sufficiently studied in clinical trials involving neonates and infants below 12 
months of age, caution is advised when treating this age group. Micafungin is indicated for children 
(including neonates) and adolescents 16 years of age and older.  
In contrast to anidulafungin, all other available treatments (caspofungin acetate, micafungin sodium, 
amphotericin B, azoles) have clinically relevant drug-drug interactions that require either monitoring 
and/or dosing adjustments, some require dosing adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment 
(caspofungin) or renal insufficiency (fluconazole), and some are associated with clinically important 
effects such as nephrotoxicity (amphotericin B formulations). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence submitted comes from a population PK/PD analysis and two clinical studies, a small 
phase I study (Duke IIR Study) evaluating the PK of anidulafungin in infants (n=6) and neonates (n=8) 
and a prospective, single arm study (A8851008) which evaluated the PK, safety and efficacy of 
anidulafungin when used to treat children (n=68) with invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The overall evaluation of these exposure data indicates that the currently proposed IV dosing regimen (a 
3.0 mg/kg [not to exceed the 200 mg adult dose] LD followed by 1.5 mg/kg [not to exceed the 100 mg 
adult dose] MD QD) is appropriate for use across all paediatric and adolescent age groups (1 month to 
<18 years old) since the anidulafungin exposures achieved are comparable to those in adults at the 
recommended dosing regimen (200 mg LD/100 mg MD QD). 
The overall global response success rate observed in Study A8851008, which is a combination of clinical 
and microbiological response as assessed by the Investigator, in the MITT population at end of IV 
treatment were 70.3% (95% CI: 57.6, 81.1). At EOT this was 71.9%, with a failure rate of 9.4% (n=6) 
and at 6 weeks follow up this was 67.2%, with a failure rate of 15.6% (n=10). The Global response of 
success at EOIVT was 87.5 % (73.2, 95.8) in the PP population. Microbiological response at EOIVT and 
EOT was slightly higher (76.6%, 49/64 at both timepoints) than the clinical cure at EOIVT (59.4%, 
38/64) and EOT (68.8%, 44/64).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The popPK analysis indicated that the proposed IV dosing regimen for paediatric subjects would result in 
a comparable exposure to that in adults. However, in the individual studies the differences in exposure in 
paediatrics and adults appeared to be much more pronounced. This should be clarified 
Study A8851008 was a descriptive, single-arm study and was open-label limiting potential inference 
regarding efficacy and safety.  
Recruitment spanned nine years, and it is likely that patients recruited in earlier years are no longer 
comparable to patients recruited in later years as the epidemiology of ICC might have changed but also 
the treatment of critically ill paediatric patients or immunocompromised patients potentially changing the 
risks of ICC or the response to treatment as a whole. This also limits the comparison of response rates 
from Study A8851008 to studies conducted in adults, for example VER002-9.  
Study A8851008 included only few subjects, therefore, there is uncertainty surrounding obtained 
estimates reflected by the wide CI around the primary estimates. Due to the limited number of subjects, 
assessments of effects in subgroups (i.e. by age, by neutropenic status) are highly uncertain. The use of 
other antifungal treatments within the studies needs to be clarified, as it is unclear what role other 
antifungal agents have in relation to the responses seen.  
No clear relationships between anidulafungin exposure parameters and efficacy were identified in 
paediatric and adult subjects with ICC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported all-causality AEs were vomiting (n=16, 23.5%), diarrhoea (n=15, 22.1%), 
and pyrexia (n=13, 19.1%). The most commonly reported laboratory-related all-causality AEs were 
increased ALT, increased AST, and transaminases increased. Increased ALT and increased AST was 
reported by 10.3% (n=7) and 7.4% (n=5) of subjects respectively. Transaminases increased was 
reported by 5.9%(n=4) of subjects. In total, 23.5% of subjects reported hepatic related AEs in this 
paediatric study. 
Overall, no new safety findings were identified for anidulafungin with regard to reported AEs, laboratory 
safety assessments, physical examinations, or vital signs assessments.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety and tolerability conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. The 
study was too small to inform adverse reactions occuring less frequently than roughly 1 in 10 paediatric 
subjects. Although there were no clear age related patterns in the safety numbers in different age strata 
are low and firm conclusions can not be drawn. Further, it is unclear whether the hepatic safety is similar 
or worse as seen in adults. 
There was no clear response between exposures and safety parameters, namely GI related adverse 
events such as vomiting and diarrhoea and hepatic adverse events. Additional analyses were provided to 
elucidate the relationship between exposure and occurrence of hepatic adverse events. Hepatic adverse 
drug reactions need to be considered when deciding whether to prescribe anidulafungin to paediatric 
patients. Wording has been included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC to inform physicians about this.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the availability of antifungal therapies, including echinocandins, for the treatment of ICC in 
children, there is still a need for licensed, effective treatments in children. As anidulafungin does not rely 
on enzymatic degradation or hepatic or renal excretion, the drug is safe to use in patients with any 
degree of hepatic or renal impairment, and there are limited drug-drug-interactions of clinical relevance. 
This makes it a potentially welcome addition to the currently available treatments. 
As the exposure in paediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years is comparable to that in adults, 
anidulafungin can be used in paediatric patients. The small, single-arm clinical study A8851008 confirmed 
efficacy of anidulafungin as the global response at EOIVT was 70%, similar as what has been seen in

adults. Although the study was limited in size, lacked a comparator arm and recruited over 9 years, 
making the possibility of inference limited, the comparable efficacy observed in this study is reassuring 
and supports the extrapolation exercise based on exposure levels in adults and children. Diarrhoea and 
vomiting were reported very commonly in these paediatric patients, similar if not more frequent as in 
adults.  
Additionally, AEs in the SOC of Hepatobiliary disorders were reported very commonly too (23.5%), which 
would appear more frequent than in adults. However, this is based upon limited numbers and it is not 
clear whether underlying comorbidities were similar between the paediatric patients and adult patient 
population. Whilst increased levels of hepatic enzymes were mostly reversible, three subjects were 
permanently discontinued from study drug and for three subjects levels did not return to baseline/normal 
levels by end of study. The hepatic adverse drug reactions are serious and need to be considered by 
physicians when deciding whether to prescribe anidulafungin to paediatric patients.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risks of anidulafungin in treating ICC in paediatric patients aged 1 month to 
18 years is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of ECALTA is positive.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 29 April 2019 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Daurismo, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure 
was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 July 2017. 
Daurismo, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/17/1923 on 16 October 2017 in the following 
condition: Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Daurismo is indicated, in combination with low-dose 
cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 
adult patients who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Daurismo as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Daurismo 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0239/2018 on the granting of a product-specific waiver. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance glasdegib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

Protocol assistance 
The Applicant received Protocol Assistance on the development relevant for the approved indication from the 
CHMP on 21 April 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2898/4/2017/II) and 28 February 2019 
(EMEA/H/SA/2898/5/2019/PA/I). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality and clinical aspects 
of the dossier: 
- the proposed strategy to provide some of the quality data during the review process;  
- the proposed clinical development plan to support registration for glasdegib in the treatment of previously 
untreated adult patients with AML in combination with chemotherapy, in particular:  
whether the results of randomised phase 2 study B1371003 of glasdegib + LDAC vs LDAC alone in 
elderly patient’s ineligible for intensive chemotherapy could be used to support full approval, 
whether the design of the proposed randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study B1371019 (i.e. 
eligibility criteria, comparator, stratification factors, SAP, PRO) in patients with AML, “fit” and “unfit” 
for intensive treatment, with or without the addition of glasdegib in both settings, is adequate to 
support marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
AML is a haematopoietic system malignancy characterized by increased proliferation of bone marrow and 
peripheral blasts, pancytopenias causing infections and bleeding, and reduced survival. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) accounts for approximately 80% of acute leukaemias diagnosed in adults. It 
has been estimated that 19,950 people were diagnosed with AML in the US, with a similar incidence in the 
EU. 
Literature reports estimated prevalence rates for AML in the EU ranging between 9.0 to 15.4 per 100,000 
population. Countries within Europe report varied AML incidence rates per 100,000 population: 2.7 in Serbia, 
3.0 in Switzerland and the Netherlands, 4.7 in Italy, 5.1 in the United Kingdom (UK), and 5.4 in Denmark. 
The median age at diagnosis is approximately 68 years for AML. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
AML is generally characterized by aberrant differentiation and proliferation of malignantly transformed 
myeloid progenitor cells but can be considered a heterogeneous disease state with various molecular and 
genetic aetiologies that result in variable clinical outcomes. When untreated or refractory to available 
treatments, AML results in the accumulation of these transformed cells within the bone marrow, suppression 
of the production of normal blood cells (resulting in severe neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia), as well as 
infiltration of these cells into other organs and tissues, and can be rapidly fatal. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
AML is a genetically heterogeneous malignancy characterized by multiple genetic mutations at the time of 
diagnosis that evolve with treatment, resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced 
survival. Diagnosis is made via bone marrow assessment. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of AML with standard intensive chemotherapy of an anthracycline plus cytarabine induction 
therapy followed by cytarabine consolidation therapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation results in 
long-term remissions in up to 60% of patients. However, treatment-related mortality of 5.5% for younger 
patients and 17.7% for elderly patients limits effectiveness. Given that the majority of patients are older and 
unable to tolerate the more intensive chemotherapy treatment, less intensive therapies such as LDAC, 
azacitidine, or decitabine are used. While less toxic non-intensive therapies may prolong OS versus the best 
supportive care, there are fewer complete remissions and shorter OS, with little chance for a cure compared 
to more intensive chemotherapies such as induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (7 days) plus 
daunorubicin (3 days) (7+3). None of the less intensive treatments are curative.

About the product 
Glasdegib is an inhibitor of SMO, a key protein in the hedgehog (Hh) pathway. Aberrant Hh signalling has 
been identified in many solid tumour types and in haematological malignancies. As an inhibitor of the Hh 
signalling pathway, glasdegib may act as an anti-leukaemic stem cell agent.  
In this application, glasdegib is proposed for regulatory approval in combination with LDAC chemotherapy for 
the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML in adult patients who are not candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy. 
The proposed regimen is 100 mg once daily by oral administration. 
The product is supplied as film-coated tablets; 25 mg and 100 mg.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of glasdegib maleate is 1-((2R,4R)-2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-
yl)-3-(4-cyanophenyl)urea maleate corresponding to the molecular formula C25H26N6O5.It has a relative 
molecular mass of 490.51 Daltons and the following structure:

Assessment report

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of glasdegib maleate was elucidated by a combination of IR, 1H and 13C NMR and UV 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and specific rotation. Single crystal X-Ray diffraction was used for the 
characterization of the asymmetric carbons and the determination of the absolute stereochemical 
configuration. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by DSC and TGA. 
Glasdegib maleate is a non-hygroscopic white to pale coloured powder. It is slightly soluble in water, over a 
range of pH 2.31 to 7.24, with a trend of decreasing solubility with increasing pH. It is very soluble in 
dimethylsulfoxide, sparingly soluble in methanol, tetrahydrofuran and has low solubility in acetone and 
ethanol.  
Glasdegib has two asymmetric centers, giving four possible stereoisomers. The absolute configuration is 2R, 
4R. There are no geometrical isomers or atropisomers for glasdegib maleate Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by chiral HPLC.  
A comprehensive polymorph and hydrate screening for glasdegib maleate was conducted using diverse 
crystallization techniques at different temperatures (including those present in the crystallization process) 
and slurries, solvent evaporations, and solvent free methods. Glasdegib maleate (Form 1) was the only 
crystalline anhydrous form identified from these studies. No new polymorphs of anhydrous glasdegib maleate 
were isolated. Additionally, no hydrated forms of glasdegib maleate were found through extensive screening. 
An amorphous form and four solvated forms were found.  
Glasdegib maleate Form 1 is physically and chemically stable under normal manufacturing and storage 
conditions as well as under accelerated conditions. This form was selected for Daurismo and has been 
consistently manufactured and used to support commercial development.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The proposed active substance is manufactured by a single manufacturer. 
The active substance is synthesized in five main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The justification for selection of the starting materials is found acceptable and follows ICH Q11 
and its questions and answer document. 
Critical steps and critical process parameters (CPP) have been identified and justified.  
The ranges and limits stated in the description of the manufacturing process were based on the ranges 
evaluated during the development of the manufacturing process. The Design of Experiments (DoE) studies 
performed demonstrated that no additional impurities are formed when quantities within these ranges are 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 11/143   
 
  
 
 
 
used, and that the selected ranges can limit the formation of impurities. The manufacturing process as 
described in section 3.2.S.2.2. of the dossier constitutes a design space. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials, reagents and solvents have been presented. Maleic acid is used in 
the last step of the synthesis to create the salt, which is the final active substance. It is a significant part in 
the composition of the active substance, however, in accordance to ICH Q11, it can be considered a reagent. 
Its quality is justified. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed. This included information on the source of the impurity, 
the controls in the starting materials, the possible transformations and the controls in the intermediates, the 
possible purge during the manufacturing process and the controls in the active substance. 
Since the medicinal product is intended to be used for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, ICH 
M7 is not applicable for the control of the impurities and the ICH Q3A qualification threshold of 0.15% was 
applied for the control of the specified impurities.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program.  
Two main synthetic pathways were used during the development of the active substance manufacturing 
process. Glasdegib dihydrochloride salt was used in early development and Phase I and Phase II clinical 
studies. This salt was deemed unsuitable for commercial development  
Four different routes were used throughout development. The reaction scheme for each of the synthetic 
routes was provided.  
Overall, changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of 
the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be supportive to that 
produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as risk assessment, and DOE studies. 
The selection of the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the active substance was based on its intended use 
in the formulation of the finished product. The active substance attributes that could have an impact on the 
quality of the tablets  were identified as critical.  
A quality risk management assessment was performed to identify potential CPPs and critical material 
attributes. The process inputs, material attributes, process operating parameters and potential links to CQAs 
were identified.  
The active substance manufacturing process was divided into nine focus areas closely related to the active 
substance quality attributes, and especially those responsible for the formation, fate and purge of the 
impurities. An experimental plan was subsequently developed and DoE studies and univariate studies 
executed in order to establish the impact of the identified parameters on the quality attributes, determine the 
extent of this impact and identify the ranges within which the process can be operated and determine the 
appropriate analytical testing strategy. Particular attention was given to the discussion of the possible 
impurities that could be present at each step and their transformations and purge.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 12/143   
 
  
 
 
The DoE studies performed are considered acceptable. Scale dependency was discussed in each step. The 
conclusions obtained were further confirmed by the controls performed on batches manufactured at pilot and 
commercial scale, which demonstrated that the quality of the intermediates/active substance was compliant 
with the specifications.  
Based on these studies, and following a query raised during the review, the applicant confirmed that the 
operational ranges of the critical process parameters as described in section 3.2.P.3.3. of the dossier 
constitute a design space. The design space has been developed at lab and pilot scale, but the scale 
independency of the different steps was justified. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space. 
The active substance is packaged in a container which complies with the requirements EU regulation 10/2011 
on plastic and articles for food use. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (IR, chiral HPLC), particle size 
(laser diffraction), assay (HPLC), maleic acid counterion content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral purity 
(HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF). 
The active substance specification includes relevant tests for its use in the finished product. The proposed 
acceptance criteria were based on the observations made on the release and stability batches, as requested 
during the evaluation procedure.  
The limits initially proposed for the control of the related substances were not considered acceptable. The 
applicant justified the proposed limits by toxicological qualifications for the specified impurities and by the 
fact that ICH M7 is not applicable for this product. These justifications were not considered adequate, the 
expectation being that impurities should be limited in line with ICH Q3A, and wider limits proposed only when 
justified by the batch results. Consequently, tighter limits in line with batch results were proposed for the 
control of the specified and unspecified impurities. 
A suitable justification for not including the control of polymorphic form, residual solvents (ethyl acetate, n-
heptane, isopropylamine, dimethyl sulfoxide, triethylamine, 4-methyl-2-pentanone and benzene), elemental 
impurities, specific rotation, reagents and the microbiological quality was provided.  
The absence of control of certain residual solvents used in the manufacturing process was justified by the 
batch history. 
The absence of testing of elemental impurities was justified based on scientific rationale and batch analysis 
data. 
Specific rotation was not included in the specification, since glasdegib has a fixed stereochemistry derived 
from the proposed commercial process which is confirmed using a chiral LC identity. The enantiomer content 
is assayed using a chiral LC purity method included in the active substance specification.  Additionally, the 
diastereomers of glasdegib are quantified in the achiral purity method.  
The absence of control of microbiological quality was justified based on low risk of microorganism 
contamination, risk assessment and batch analysis data.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis were provided for 32 batches of the active substance, which included 8 process validation 
batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site using the commercial synthesis route SR4. Batch 
analyses for three batches of glasdegib maleate used to support toxicology studies were also provided. The 
results were very similar between the batches and were compliant with the acceptance criteria in the 
specification. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured at one of the 
development sites using the commercial process and stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 
18 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The stability batches were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, solid form, 
particle size and microbial quality. The analytical methods used for the analysis were the same as for release.  
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no particular trends were observed.  
Supportive stability data from one batch of the active substance obtained through each of the previous 
manufacturing routes, packed in a container similar to the one proposed for the commercial batches were 
also provided. These batches were stored under ICH climatic zone II conditions of 25°C/60%RH and 
30°C/75% RH as long term conditions and, 40°C/75% RH as accelerated conditions. Results at 36 months 
under long term conditions and 6 months under accelerated conditions were provided. Samples were tested 
for appearance, assay, chiral and achiral purity, water content, solid form. All results met the specifications.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. After exposure the 
samples were analysed for appearance, assay, related substances (specified, individual unspecified, total 
impurities) and chiral purity. No changes were observed, and it was concluded that the active substance is 
not light sensitive and does not require a ‘protect from light’ restriction. 
Results under stress conditions were also provided. Solid samples of active substance were exposed to 
elevated temperature (with and without humidity) and simulated sunlight filtered through window glass and 
were analysed for assay and purity. Solutions of drug substance were exposed to acid, base, hydrogen 
peroxide, auto-oxidation, Fe (III), and Cu (II) and were analysed for assay and purity. Degradation was 
observed after exposure to base and hydrogen peroxide. No significant degradation was observed under the 
other conditions. Mass balance was achieved in all conditions. The results show that the method proposed for 
the analysis of the related substances is stability indicating.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months at 30°C/75% RH in the proposed 
container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate-release round film-coated tablets. The tablets are available in 
two strengths: 25 mg and 100 mg of glasdegib, equivalent to 32.8 mg glasdegib maleate and 131.1 mg 
glasdegib maleate, respectively. 
The tablet strengths are differentiated by colour (yellow for 25 mg and pale orange for 100 mg), debossing 
and size. 
The finished product may be packaged in heat induction sealed high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles or 
PVC/foil blisters. 
Glasdegib maleate is a salt of the active compound, glasdegib, with maleic acid. It is a white to pale coloured 
powder that is classified as a BCS Class IV compound (i.e., low solubility and low permeability) based on the 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System. Glasdegib maleate salt, Form 1, has a high melting point, is non-
hygroscopic, and exhibits excellent physical and chemical stability.  
Active substance particle size studies were focused to understand the impact of material properties on dosage 
form quality attributes, such as potency, content uniformity, dissolution and tablet physical properties with 
statistically designed multivariate experimental trials (DoEs). Various active substance lots with a wide range 
of particle size distributions were evaluated throughout the finished product development process, during 
clinical manufacturing, and with the manufacture of registration batches. The impact of active substance 
particle size on bioavailability, finished product stability, and manufacturability was also evaluated. Based on 
the results, the specification of the active substance particle size was defined. 
Excipients chosen are compendial (microcrystalline cellulose and dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous as 
diluents, sodium starch glycolate type A as disintegrant, magnesium stearate NF VG (impalpable powder) as 
lubricant) and not compendial (colour mixture yellow Opadry® II 33G120011 and color mixture beige 
Opadry® II 33G170003).  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. All of them other than the film-coating mixtures 
(Opadry® II yellow and Opadry® II beige) are of Ph. Eur quality. The film-coating mixtures are not 
compendial, but their individual constituents comply with Ph. Eur., except the colouring agents iron oxides.  
The iron oxides comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.  
The functionality-related characteristics of the excipients and their controls have been discussed. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The amount of excipients used in the composition has been properly justified by different studies performed 
during the development.  
An excipient compatibility screening with conventional immediate release formulation excipients was 
completed using binary mixtures of the active substance and excipient. No significant degradation was 
observed. Supporting development data and registration stability studies showed that these excipients are 
suitable to enable a stable finished product.

An enhanced development approach was used for the design and development of glasdegib maleate film-
coated tablets. It was based on a risk-based approach incorporating statistically DoEs to evaluate the impact 
of raw material variability and process parameters variability on the CQAs of the finished product. 
In order to select the commercial formulation a material risk assessment was performed to identify properties 
of the formulation components which could have an impact on tablet core quality attributes.  
As mentioned above, a dihydrochloride salt of glasdegib was used in early development and all of Phase 1 
and Phase 2 clinical studies. This salt was deemed unsuitable for commercial development  Following 
extensive salt screening, the glasdegib maleate salt was developed as the preferred form due to its physical 
properties and stability and was shown to have equivalent exposure to glasdegib dihydrochloride in a relative 
bioavailability study (B1371014). The maleate salt was selected for commercial tablet formulation 
development. A pivotal bioequivalence study (B1371026) was conducted to compare a single 100mg dose of 
glasdegib commercial maleate tablet formulation to a single 100mg dose of a glasdegib dihydrochloride. The 
results indicated that the proposed commercial glasdegib maleate tablet was bioequivalent to the glasdegib 
dihydrochloride tablet.  
The commercial glasdegib maleate film-coated tablet has been manufactured to support registration stability 
and clinical studies. 
In addition to immediate-release tablets, various clinical trial formulations were developed for the clinical 
studies: an oral solution, oral suspension and intravenous solution. 
The development of the commercial glasdegib maleate film-coated tablet included evaluations of drug 
loading, active substance particle size, excipients concentration and grade, and the film- coating formulation.  
A material risk assessment followed by statistically designed experiments (DoEs) were performed to optimize 
the commercial formulation. Based on the risk assessment, the components with the highest potential to 
impact finished product quality attributes were identified and defined as critical. 
Based on the results from the DOE studies, the formulation was developed. 
Studies evaluating the impact of excipients on finished product manufacturing and performance were also 
conducted. 
The impact of excipient lot-to-lot variability on glasdegib maleate tablets was assessed. The potential impact 
of lot-to-lot variability was deemed to be low. 
The impact of variations in formulation composition on finished product quality attributes was also evaluated.  
Glasdegib tablet cores of both 25 mg and 100 mg strength were evaluated for assignment of the holding 
times in accordance with “Annex 4: General guidance on hold-time studies”. The applied holding times using 
commercial bulk packaging configuration for glasdegib tablet cores showed no negative effect on 
manufacturing performance (subsequent film-coating operation) and product quality. Based on these results 
the total holding time, beginning with packaging into the commercial bulk packaging configuration until start 
of film-coating was defined. 
The dissolution method selection has been described, including apparatus, pH and agitation speed. The 
discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The glasdegib maleate tablets core are manufactured by direct compression, using a continuous 
manufacturing (CM) platform designed by Pfizer called Portable, Continuous, Miniature and Modular (PCMM). 
The continuous manufacturing process involves the first three steps: (1) continuous feeding and (2) 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 16/143   
 
  
 
 
continuous mixing, followed by (3) tablet compression using a conventional rotary tablet press. The final unit 
operation is a film-coating process which is performed as a batch process using conventional equipment. The 
process flow and equipment train used at the manufacturing site proposed to supply the EU market is the 
same that was used in the manufacture of registration stability and clinical batches. 
Adequate discussion around the equipment design and configuration, and its impact on the process 
performance, has been provided. 
The process development of glasdegib maleate film-coated tablets has focused on the product and quality 
attributes identified in the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) that ensure the quality, efficacy, stability and 
safety of the product, and are defined in the product specification.A combination of risk-based assessments, 
laboratory studies, computational models, and manufacturing experience resulted in a comprehensive 
understanding of the formulation and process conditions and their impact on these quality attributes.  
This risk assessment was performed based upon prior knowledge as well as the knowledge that had been 
gained throughout the development of the manufacturing process. Attributes and parameters were 
categorized as either critical or non-critical, based on their impact to the product quality. 
A multivariate experimental plan was developed to gain further process understanding across the 
manufacturing process steps and evaluate the impact of the identified process parameter ranges on dosage 
form quality attributes.  
Feeding performance has been adequately addressed. Experimental studies demonstrated the ability of an 
individual gravimetric feeder to deliver raw material at a target mass flow rate with minor fluctuations in 
instantaneous mass flow rate based on an overall target mass flow rate. These gravimetric feeder studies 
included a broad range of active substance and excipient lots, in order to evaluate the impact of material 
attribute variability on feeder performance. The gravimetric feeder set point (in kg/h), for each formulation 
component has been described.  Each gravimetric feeder is continuously monitored and controlled to a target 
mass feed rate. For the mixing, a risk assessment was conducted to guide the creation of experimental 
activities to characterize the residence time distribution (RTD). The results of the broad range of formulation 
compositions studied provided the foundation to establish control and alarm limits for the gravimetric feeders 
and CMT and ensure that the formulation composition remains within compositional ranges. The dampening 
capacity of the system has been demonstrated.  Complementing the RTD characterization work, three 
representative step-change experiments were conducted to demonstrate the overall process system 
dynamics.  
A NIR in-process control (IPC) system that allows monitoring and potential real-time diversion of 
nonconforming material has been developed. The model post-approval changes have been described in a 
post-approval change management protocol (PACMP). This PACMP was revised during the evaluation 
procedure to bring it in line with the EMA guideline on NIR and its addendum. 
A contingency plan to be used when the NIR is not available (e.g. NIR model update) consisting of stratified 
sampling of tablet cores with off-line testing by the HPLC reference method has been established. 
The multiple layers of control and alarm ensure that variation in tablet core concentration will be detected 
and non-conforming material will be rejected. 
The  primary  packaging  is  a  PVC  (polyvinyl  chloride)  blister  sealed  with  aluminium  foil,  or  a  high-density 
polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottle  with  polypropylene  closure.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The commercial glasdegib maleate immediate release 25 mg and 100 mg tablet cores are manufactured using 
Pfizer’s  PCMM  manufacturing  line.  The  CM  concerns  the  first  three  steps  of  glasdegib  film-coated  tablet 
manufacturing  process:  feeding,  mixing  and  compression.  Core  tablets  manufactured  from  this  continuous 
process are then coated in a traditional batch tablet coating process.  
Given the continuous mode of operation, the process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The batch size has been defined by the amount of input raw materials to make a predetermined amount of 
tablet cores.  
The continuous feeders and continuous mixer are operated to deliver material to  the tablet press at a fixed 
total mass throughput. Start up and shut down processes, as well as strategy for controlled process pause that 
may  be  required  following  process  events  that  may  occur  during  routine  manufacture,  and  the  strategy  for 
material diversion have been described. 
There is no rework procedure for glasdegib maleate film-coated tablets. 
Following a query raised during the review, the applicant confirmed that the operational ranges of the critical 
process parameters constitute a design space. The available development data, the proposed control strategy 
and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space. 
The  control  strategy  for  Daurismo  tablets  comprises  material  attributes,  process  parameters,  in-process 
controls, GMP controls and the finished product specification. 
Taking into account that the proposed manufacturing process involves continuous manufacturing and that all 
the  development  was  conducted  at  a  manufacturing  site  which  will not  manufacture  the  product  for  the  EU 
market, the data from the process validation at the EU manufacturing site was requested during the review.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Overall, it has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and 
comprises appearance, identification (LC retention time and UV spectra), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits: TAMC, 
TYMC, E. coli (Ph. Eur.) 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities (EIs) in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk assessment concluded 
that none of the excipients used in the finished product formulations poses a risk of contributing Class 1 and 
Class 2A EIs, at levels above the 30% control threshold of their oral permitted daily exposures (PDEs), in the 
finished product. To confirm this, four batches each tablet strength manufactured according to the 
commercial process were screened for EIs identified during the risk assessments using a validated ICP-MS 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 18/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
method. The individual Class 1 and Class 2A EIs were all below the 30% control threshold values, with 
respect to their individual oral PDEs and/or concentration limits. Based on this, no controls or acceptance 
criteria for individual elemental impurities are proposed for the 25 mg or 100 mg glasdegib maleate 
immediate release film-coated tablets. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A justification for not including a test for water content has been provided. This is acceptable. 
Chiral purity has also been omitted, since it is controlled in the active substance and no increase in its level 
were observed in glasdegib 25 mg and 100 mg tablets exposed to high temperature and humidity conditions 
and light exposure under forced degradation conditions. This is in line with decision tree #5 of Q6A guidance. 
Following  the  request  from  the  CHMP  during  the  review,  a  risk  assessment  for  the  potential  presence  of 
nitrosamine impurities was provided. This risk assessment followed the EFPIA workflow for active substance 
manufacturing process risk assessment for presence of N-nitrosamines. It included the risk assessment of all 
raw  material  used  in  the  synthesis.  No  risk  of  nitrosamine  formation  (no  nitrosating  agents  used  in  the 
manufacturing process) or source of contamination was identified within the active substance manufacturing 
process.  The  finished  product  formula  (active  substance,  excipients  and  degradants)  does  not  contain  a 
secondary amine functional group, no risk has been identified for the glasdegib finished product. Furthermore, 
it was noted that glasdegib is intended to treat advanced cancer patients and the usual criteria for genotoxic 
impurities does not apply. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results obtained throughout development are provided for 58 batches of pilot or commercial 
scale (which include 7 commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site) 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of each tablet strength stored for up to 24 months under 
long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30 ºC / 75% RH) 25 ºC / 60% RH, and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
glasdegib 25 mg and 100 mg are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packagings proposed for marketing (i.e. HDPE bottles or PVC/foil blisters). They were manufactured at one of 
the  manufacturing  sites  used  during  the  development  program,  which  is  not  the  site  proposed  for  EU 
manufacture, but uses the same process flow and equipment train.  
A bracketing design was applied to the testing for the HDPE bottles based on Moisture Vapor Transmission 
Rate (MVTR) principles. This is acceptable considering the number of tablets included in the commercial 
presentations (30 for the 100 mg tablets, 60 for the 25 mg tablets). 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
There were no significant trends observed in the stability results under any of the storage conditions. 
Although a minor increasing trend for the water content was observed under some storage conditions (e.g. 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 19/143   
 
  
 
 
higher humidity conditions), the increases did not impact chemical or physical stability or quality and 
performance of the product. 
Additional stability data from three commercial scale batches of each tablet strength manufactured at the site 
proposed for commercial manufacture for the EU market packaged in HDPE bottles and PVC/foil blisters 
stored for up to 6 months at the long term storage conditions of 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH and 6 
months at the accelerated storage condition of 40°C/75% RH were also presented during the evaluation 
procedure. The samples were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products, and dissolution. The 
stability data were consistent with the results from the primary stability batches, with all results meeting the 
acceptance criteria. 
An in-use open bottle study was carried out on two batches of each tablet strength. At the initial point of the 
stability study and following storage in sealed bottles for 9 and 21 months at 30°C/75%RH, bottles were 
opened, the cap and seal were removed and the bottles were stored without closure at 30°C/75% RH for 90 
days. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and water content. No 
significant changes were observed in any of the attributes measured (other than an expected increase in 
water content) during the in-use study and all results met the acceptance criteria. As discussed earlier, the 
increase in water content did not adversely impact stability, quality or performance of the product. 
Supportive stability studies were performed, consisting of (1) an open bottle thermal cycle and short term 
accelerated thermal/humidity study, (2) an Accelerated Stability Assessment Program (ASAP) challenge, (3) 
a comparative study assessing the stability performance of glasdegib maleate tablet cores produced at the 
development and EU commercial manufacturing sites following short term, accelerated studies and (4) forced 
degradation studies. These are summarized below. 
To support minor shipping excursions, open bottle thermal cycle and short term accelerated thermal/humidity 
studies were completed on one batch of each strength of both the film-coated tablets and the intermediate 
tablet cores. Samples were stored in 60 cc HDPE bottles without closure or heat-induction seal and exposed 
to two cycles of 40°C/75% RH and -20°C, or 50°C /75% RH for 3 days. 
The appearance, assay, degradation products and dissolution performance of the 25 mg and 100 mg tablets 
and the intermediate tablet core remained essentially unchanged through both the open bottle thermal cycle 
study and the open bottle 3-day 50°C/75% RH exposure. There were no reportable degradation products. As 
expected in an open bottle study, the water content in the samples increased. This increase did not have a 
negative impact on the quality attributes mentioned above and, glasdegib maleate film-coated tablets and 
tablet cores are not shipped in open containers, therefore the increase in water content is not of concern. 
These data are supportive of minor shipping excursions for the glasdegib maleate film-coated tablets and 
tablet cores. 
For the ASAP study, 25 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets were stored in open glass containers and exposed 
to various temperature, humidities and durations.  The model predicted the shelf-life limiting degradant 
would remain below the proposed specification limit after 36 months. 
A short-term, supportive stability study was conducted to compare the stability performance of tablet cores 
produced at the site proposed for EU manufacture and those produced at the development facility used to 
manufacture the primary stability batches  The assessment of a single strength of tablet cores produced per 
site was justified and considered sufficient for the comparison. The results confirmed the equivalent stability 
performance of tablets manufactured at the two sites. 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 20/143   
 
  
 
 
Forced degradation experiments were performed on 25mg and 100 mg primary stability batches to establish 
the extent and nature of potential degradation pathways and to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity 
method. The experiments included thermal, thermal humidity, and photolysis studies No degradation was 
observed under thermal stress conditions and under photolysis stress condition. The studies under thermal 
humidity stress conditions showed an increase in degradation. The liquid chromatographic assay and purity 
method for glasdegib maleate immediate release film-coated tablets was shown to be specific, selective and 
stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation 
products, and water content. No significant changes were observed in any of the parameters tested. 
Therefore, it is concluded that glasdegib maleate 25 mg and 100 mg immediate release film-coated tablets 
are stable to light and no precautionary packaging or labeling is required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years for Daurismo 25 mg and 100 mg 
immediate release film-coated tablets, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), is acceptable. This medicinal 
product does not require any special storage conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. A quality-by-design approach has been followed for the development of 
the active substance and finished product. A design space for the active substance and the finished product 
manufacture have been defined. The film-coating tablets are manufactured using a continuous direct 
compression process comprising feeding, blending and compression, followed by a conventional film-coating 
batch process. The product is released based on end-product testing. Multiple layers of control and alarm 
have been established ensure adequate tablet composition. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on TSE safety.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
Glasdegib (PF-04449913) is small molecule inhibitor of Smoothened (SMO), a key transmembrane protein in 
the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog pathway can occur by different 
mechanisms and result in cancer. Aberrant Hh signalling has been identified in a variety of human leukaemia 
and leukaemia stem cells (LSC).

In vitro, glasdegib bind to human SMO (amino acids 181-787) with an IC50 of 7.7 ± 7.2 nM. Glasdegib 
inhibited Shh-induced Gli reporter activity with an IC50 of 5.22 ± 1.65 nM (n=12). Glasdegib, at 40 nM, 
inhibited >75% of the Shh-induced Gli1 levels assessed in human fibroblasts. The effect of glasdegib was 
tested on a panel of kinases, only 3 kinases were weakly inhibited: cRAF, GRK4 and ALK4. No information is 
reported relative to potential effects of those kinase inhibition.  
Glasdegib demonstrated antitumor efficacy in a Ptc+/-p53+/- GEM tumour model of medulloblastoma, 
specific model for the Hh pathway. A dose-dependent regression of tumour was demonstrated with maximal 
effect at ≥ 25 mg/kg.  Glasdegib-induced tumour regression persisted over time with a lack of measurable 
tumour regrowth over 45 days following a 10-day course of once daily dosing (100 mg/kg).  
Glasdegib was also tested on 3 AML patient derived xenograft models (AML009, AML183 and BM2407) as 
monotherapy and in combination with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) (AML183 and 009) and daunorubicin (DA)

and cytarabine (BM2407). In tested models, glasdegib has no antileukemic effect alone on CD45+/CD33+ 
blasts compared to vehicle group while LDAC alone or DA alone have effect. As a combination, a proof of 
efficacy was provided on AML 183 with LDAC but not on AML009, in which the combination with glasdegib 
showed no additional benefits on CD45+/CD33+ cells. In the BM2407 model, the combination of glasdegib 
and DA enhanced the anti-leukemic effect compared to DA treatment. As monotherapy, no proof of efficacy 
of glasdegib was brought in AML models.  
Glasdegib produced a dose- and time-dependent reduction of Gli1 mRNA levels in medulloblastoma tumour 
and skin following a similar time course (IC50 = 73.2 nM for TGI, 101.8 nM; 9.4 nM free for Gli1 mRNA 
suppression in tumours and 675.7 nM for Gli1 mRNA suppression in the skin).   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The effect of glasdegib was tested against a panel of enzymes, receptors and ion-channels in vitro using a 
Cerep battery. Glasdegib produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the Nav1.5 peak current, with an 
IC50 value of 2.6 µM.

No statistically significant effects on any behaviour, no

In telemetered dogs (5 and 30 mg/kg), glasdegib produced increases in QT and QTc intervals until 22 hours 
after dosing and statistically significant increase in QRS interval (30 mg/kg) up to 14 hours after dosing as 
well as heart rate decrease. This effect was consistent with the inhibition observed on Nav1.5. No effect on 
blood pressure were reported. A safety margin between the Cmax plasma concentration of 1972.5 ng/mL 
achieved after dosing with 5 mg/kg corresponds to approximately 13x the predicted clinically efficacious total 
concentration of approximately 150 ng/mL.  
Regarding respiratory system, significant effects were observed on tidal volume (increase) but were not dose 
related or linked to respiratory rate / minute volume. In the 26-week repeat dose GLP rat toxicity study, 
laboured breathing was observed in some animals administered 50 mg/kg/day but this dose was not 
tolerated and resulted in several adverse clinical signs and moribundity. There were no microscopic findings 
in the lungs of any animals.  
Concerning central nervous system, glasdegib had no effect on locomotor activity, behaviour and body 
temperature until 50 mg/kg at 4x the observed unbound Cmax at the 100 mg QD clinical dose. Additionally, 
FOB and locomotor activity assessment was added on to the repeat dose 26-week chronic toxicity study in 
rats. Several effects were observed at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day. There were no microscopic findings noted in the 
brain of any animals. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The ADME profile of glasdegib has been evaluated in in vitro assays and in vivo in rat, dog and rabbit.  
Analytical methods 
Concentrations of glasdegib in animal plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS validated in rat, dog and rabbit 
plasmas over the range 1-1000 ng/ml for the 3 species. The full validation of measurement included 
selectivity, linearity, LLOQ, carry-over, intra-and inter-assay precision and accuracy, stock solution stability, 
short-term matrix stability, freeze-thaw and long-term matrix stability and dilution integrity. All the results 
met the acceptance criteria.

Terminal half-life after IV administration was 1.2 to 1.4 hours in rat and 4.2 hours in dog. Volume of 
distribution was 4.2 to 4.8 L/kg in rat and 4.2 L/kg in dog, hence glasdegib appear to be mainly distributed to 
tissues. Oral bioavailability was 68% in dog and 19 to 35% in rat. Bioavailability was higher in fasted rats. 
Food effect of glasdegib oral bioavailability was evaluated in a clinical study.  
The PK of glasdegib was characterized in rats and dogs, following consecutive daily oral administration in 
repeat dose toxicity studies and fetal development (EFD) toxicity. In rats, during repeat-dose toxicity studies 
(1-month, 13-week and 9-month), no apparent sex-related differences in exposure were demonstrated. Mean 
systemic exposure to glasdegib (AUC24) increased with dose in a greater than dose proportional manner. In 
the 26-week repeat-dose study, apparent accumulation of glasdegib was observed (AUC24 and Cmax), 
ranging from 2.0x to 6.2x when compared to the exposures on Day 1, while steady-state exposures on 
Weeks 13 and 26 were similar to those observed in previous studies. Glasdegib was rapidly absorbed in dogs 
with mean Tmax occurring <3 hours post dose for all dose groups across all studies.  
Distribution 
Glasdegib appeared to be moderately to highly protein bound, in plasma , with the overall mean fraction 
unbound of 0.0470 (CD-1 mice), 0.0932 (SCID mice), 0.110 (SD rats), 0.0203 (NZW rabbit), 0.141 (Beagle 
dog), 0.0899 (human) across all evaluated concentrations. The binding to human serum albumin and  alpha 
1-acid glycoprotein was moderate with fu of 0.204 and 0.478, respectively.

Glasdegib demonstrated species dependent blood partitioning with a modest preferential distribution into the 
blood cells of rats and humans, a limited distribution into the blood cells in rabbits, over a concentration 
range of 0.2 to 50 µM and a marked, concentration-dependent and saturable preferential distribution into the 
blood cells of dogs.  
In vivo, glasdegib was widely distributed to tissues in a QWBA study in rats after oral gavage. Maximum 
concentration was reached 0.5 hour post-dose in the majority of tissues. The highest concentrations of 
radioactivity in tissues were found in uveal tract, liver, kidney and renal substructures, adrenal gland, and 
pancreas. Elimination was quite complete except for the eyes and uveal tract (until 672 h). Glasdegib 
penetrate the blood:brain barrier, at low levels and for short duration after oral dosing and exhibited an 
affinity for pigmented ocular tissues containing melanin. This association was slowly reversible, with a slower 
elimination rate (t1/2 values of 717 and 1656 hours) than observed for non-pigmented skin.  
Metabolism 
In vitro studies were performed on HLM and human enzymes (UGT, CYP), a comparative study was 
performed on rat, dog, monkey, human and mouse liver microsomes, human hepatocytes, rat bile and rat 
and dog plasma.

the primary metabolic pathway in rat involves 
hydroxylation of the benzimidazole ring followed by 
conjugation with glucuronic acid.

The metabolism of glasdegib was low and qualitatively similar across species with varying abundance in liver 
microsomes and human hepatocytes. Predominantly oxidative metabolites were detected in vitro and 
included M1, M2, M3, and M4.  
Considering CYP P450 phenotyping, total CYPs’ contribution to glasdegib metabolism is > 91% and 
contribution of non-CYPs is < 9% and CYP3A4 major isoform is mainly involved with minor contributions from 
remaining CYPs. The metabolism was NADPH dependent in non-clinical species and human matrices with 5 
metabolites identified. UGT1A9 was identified as the enzyme responsible for metabolizing glasdegib to M8 N 
glucuronide observed in vitro and present in human urine.  
In vivo metabolism studies were conducted in rat and dog plasmas and excreta and compared to humans 
after oral administration.

major component of dog plasma (83.7% and 80.1% of the total drug-related material in M and F), and excreta, (22.3% 
of the total dose (comprising 1.8% of the total dose in urine and 20.5% of the total dose in feces) in male dogs and 
28.0% of the total dose (comprising 1.9% of the total dose in urine and 26.1% of the total dose in feces) in female dogs 
. 
 primary metabolic pathways: N-demethylation, oxidation, dehydrogenation and nitrile hydrolysis. 
In plasma, an unknown metabolite and a product of mono-oxidation in the benzimidazole group were the most abundant 
metabolites in male and female dogs, although all metabolites in plasma individually accounted for ≤5% of the circulating 
radioactivity. 
A product of mono-oxidation in the benzimidazole group : most abundant metabolite in excreta, (51.0% and 45.4% of the 
dose in M and F dogs respectively).  
The N-desmethyl metabolite accounted for 4.3% and 3.9% of the dose in the excreta of male and female dogs 
respectively, whilst all other metabolites in the excreta individually accounted for <2% of the dose. Additional sites of 
metabolism identified in dog plasma and excreta included mono-oxidation and dehydrogenation in the piperidine ring, 
mono-oxidation in the benzonitrile group and hydrolysis of the nitrile group to form a primary amide.

In vivo, unchanged glasdegib is the major component of naïve rat plasma and excreta and either bile-duct 
cannulated rat excreta. Nine metabolites were identified in rat (M1, M2, M2, M4, M5, M9, M10, M12, M13), 
the first 5 being predominant and the remaining ones existing as minor components. Unchanged glasdegib is 
also the major component retrieved in dog plasma and excreta. M2 was predominant in rat plasma (25%) 
and M4 only was observed in dog (high dose). In plasma, an unknown metabolite and a product of mono-
oxidation in the benzimidazole group were the most abundant metabolites in male and female dogs, although 
all metabolites in plasma individually accounted for ≤5% of the circulating radioactivity. The major metabolic 
pathways of glasdegib seem to be oxidation (N-demethylation, hydroxylation and dehydrogenation), primary 
glucuronidation, and secondary N-glucuronidation of oxidative metabolites in both rats and dogs.  
Glasdegib and radioactivity related to glasdegib is mainly excreted through faeces and bile in rat and dog. 
Metabolic profiles in plasma, urine and faeces were overall considered to be similar among non-clinical 
species and humans. Three glucuronidated metabolites were identified as unique for human plasma and 
urine. Two of those (M6, M7) were below 2% of total radioactivity in plasma. The third (M8) comprised of 
7.2% in plasma and were not an acyl glucuronide and therefore not of toxicological concern. UGT1A9 was 
suggested to be responsible for formation of M8. 
Excretion 
The excretion of glasdegib was investigated in rat and dog and compared to humans using [14C]-glasdegib 
(study 8309181 and 182).  
In male and female beagle dogs after a single oral dose of [14C]PF-04449913 monohydrate-2HCl (5-mg/kg 
dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose). Blood was collected through 24 hours postdose and excretion profiles of 
total radioactivity were determined through 168 hours postdose. Cmax in blood and plasma occurred at 2 h 
postdose for males and at 1 h postdose for females. Blood and plasma radioactivity concentrations were 
quantifiable in all dogs through 24 hours postdose and were generally at least 2-fold lower in plasma than 
blood at the corresponding time points over this duration. After reaching Cmax, plasma total radioactivity 
concentrations declined, with an average terminal plasma elimination t1/2 of 4.8 hours for males and 4.5 
hours for females. The predominant elimination route of radioactivity was fecal excretion and the majority of 
the radioactivity was eliminated within 48 h postdose for both genders. Through 168 hours postdose, average 
recoveries in feces accounted for 82.4% and 83.0% of the dose for males and females, respectively. The 
average recovery in urine accounted for 7.20% and 7.50% of the dose in males and females, respectively. 
The average total recoveries of the administered dose were 93.0% for males and 92.5% for females. 
In SD rats, excretion profiles of total radioactivity were determined in intact male and female rats through 
168 hours postdose, and in BDC male and female rats through 48 hours postdose. For males and females, 
after a single oral dose of [14C]PF-04449913 (10-mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose), Cmax in plasma occurred 
at 1 hour postdose and plasma radioactivity concentrations were quantifiable in all rats through 24 hours 
postdose. After reaching Cmax, plasma total radioactivity concentrations declined, with a terminal plasma 
elimination t1/2 of 5.9 hours for males and 3.3 hours for females. The predominant elimination route of 
radioactivity was faecal excretion. The majority of the radioactivity was eliminated within 24 and 48 hours 
postdose for male and female rats, respectively. Through 168 hours postdose, average recoveries in faeces 
accounted for 93.7% and 89.2% of the dose for males and females, respectively. For males, the average 
recovery in urine accounted for 5.66% of the dose. For females, the average recovery in urine accounted for 
5.88% of the dose. Total average recoveries of the dose were 100% and 96.7% for male and female rats, 
respectively. After oral administration of [14C]PF-04449913 to BDC male and female rats, biliary excretion of 
radioactivity through 48 hours postdose accounted for 26.0% and 45.7% of the dose for the male and female 
rats, respectively. Recoveries of radioactivity in faeces were 67.6% for the male rat and 41.0% for the 
 
 
female rat. Recoveries of radioactivity in urine from male and female rats were 2.82% and 13.9%, 
respectively. Total recovery of the dose was 101% for the male BDC rat and 102% for the female BDC rat. 
Bile and urine recovery data indicated that a minimum of 29% and 60% of the orally-administered 
radioactivity was absorbed in male and female BDC rats through 48 hours postdose, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies with glasdegib have not been conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Six pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in SD rats and Beagle dogs from 29-day to 26 and 
39-week studies, respectively. Glasdegib was administered in 0.5% methylcellulose across studies. The non-
pivotal 7 and 10-day and pivotal 1-month studies were conducted using the dihydrochloride salt form 
(lot#121675-119-8); all other pivotal studies were conducted using the maleate salt form (lot#705848-213-
00) which is the form that will be commercially available. Similar exposures were achieved between the two 
salt forms in repeat-dose toxicity studies and there were no sex related differences in exposure.

In rats, the main target organs were kidney (mild to marked tubular degeneration/necrosis, cytomegaly, 
inflammation, regeneration, increased creatinine, increased kidney weight), bone physis (femur, sternum 
mild to moderate disorganized and hypertrophic chrondrocytes; partial closure of epiphysis), abnormal mouth 
and incisor teeth (mild to marked incisor tooth degeneration/necrosis; complete loss of apical portion of 
teeth, swollen gingiva, and clear oral discharge, malocclusions), peripheral nerve (minimal to mild axonal 
degeneration swollen axons, and multifocal relative increases in Schwann cell numbers) and testis (severe 
hypospermatogenesis at 50 mg/kg/day, partial to complete loss of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and 
spermatids; degeneration of seminiferous tubules in some animals). The NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day for all 
studies. Regarding longer duration studies, at recovery necropsies, glasdegib-related microscopic 
observations persisted in the teeth, femur, and sternum of animals and testis of males administered 50 or 
100 mg/kg/day, indicating a lack of recovery. The kidney degeneration/necrosis and axonal degeneration 
nerve observed at the terminal euthanasia were not observed at the recovery euthanasia.  
Concerning dog, glasdegib was well tolerated up to 5 mg/kg/day during 1 month except microscopic kidney 
findings. The NOAEL was established at 1.0 mg/kg for 1- and 3-month administration and was not 
established for chronic study. The target organs were similar to rat species: kidney (tubule 
degeneration/necrosis tubular dilatation increased urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations, and/or 
granular casts in the urine), liver (mixed cell inflammation centrilobular/midzonal, single cell necrosis of 
hepatocytes, Kupffer cell/macrophage pigment, and centrilobular hepatocyte vacuolation, increased ALT/AST, 
ALP, GGT). Evidence of partial recovery was noted for microscopic liver findings after a 16-week recovery 
phase in animals administered 10 mg/kg/day. No test article-related microscopic findings were present in the 
kidney of recovery animals. Non-adverse test article-related findings in the skin/subcutis included mild 
atrophy of hair shafts and minimal to mild follicular ectasia; these findings corresponded with clinical and 
macroscopic observations of alopecia. Other non-adverse, test article-related findings were present in the 
GALT/Peyer's Patch (minimal to mild decreased cellularity of lymphocytes), thymus (increased severity of 
decreased cellularity of lymphocytes), mesenteric lymph node (minimal decreased cellularity of lymphocytes), 
pancreas (minimal to mild decreased zymogen granules), and prostate (mild decreased secretion). No test 
article-related microscopic findings were present in the skin/subcutis, GALT/Peyer's Patch, thymus, 
mesenteric lymph node, pancreas, or prostate of recovery animals.  
A study (09LJ058/Non-GLP) in rats was a study to explore the mechanism of the renal findings and suggest 
biomarkers to be used in the clinical setting. This study was conducted at one active dose-level, namely 250 
mg/kg/day for 7 days. Again, renal findings were evident. In 4 out of 4 rats on Day 3, mild renal tubular 
degeneration correlated with increased Kim-1 urine levels. This was also the case for αGST, another 
biomarker for early detection of kidney injury. These two biomarkers were suggested as sensitive early 
biomarkers for renal injury (i.e. acute tubular necrosis, Han et al, 2002, or cisplatin kidney injury, Saleena et 
al, 2012). These two biomarker were not used in clinical studies to monitor early signs for kidney injury 
because  1) Assays were not validated at the time of Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, 2) No signs of glasdegib 
induced kidney injury was observed in clinical studies, 3) The population included in the clinical studies 
presents multiple confounding factors making interpretation of biomarker data difficult and finally 4) No 
clinically relevant dose-dependent changes in serum creatinine were reported in monotherapy studies 
including supratherapeutic doses of glasdegib. 
The main identified target organs of glasdegib are kidney, bones, teeth, testis, liver, skin, and GI. Additional 
clinical observations of alopecia, weight loss, and muscle tremors/twitching, known class effects of SMO 
inhibitors, were observed in both species.  
 
 
Genotoxicity 
Glasdegib underwent a complete genotoxicity tests battery in vitro and in vivo, included the definitive 
microbial reverse mutation assay, human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay.

Negative 
Glasdegib was negative in the Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay and did not induce significant structural 
chromosome aberrations in human lymphocyte cultures when tested up to concentrations that produced 
marked mitotic suppression (i.e., 58%). The micronucleus assay was conjunction with the 1-month toxicity 
study in rats, no clastogenic activity and/or disruption of the mitotic apparatus by counting micronuclei in 
polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in rat bone marrow was detected.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and pre-and post-natal development studies were not conducted with glasdegib.  
Embryofoetal development (pEFD) studies were conducted in rats and rabbits according to GLP regulations on 
a lower number of animals than in conventional studies, and included: assessments of foetal survival and 
body weight, as well as external, visceral and skeletal examinations.

The embryo-foetotoxic and teratogenic potential of glasdegib in rats and rabbits has been observed. In rats, 
this developmental toxicity occurred at non-maternotoxic dose levels. Treatment-related embryolethality 
(early and late resorptions) in both species, and abortions in rabbits were reported in most treated groups 
but not in low dosed groups. In both species, multiple treatment-related external, visceral and skeletal 
malformations were observed. They consisted mainly in craniofacial malformations, malformed limbs, 
paws/digits, trunk and tail, dilation of brain, malpositioned/malformed eyes, misshapen head, small tongue, 
absent palate, teeth and viscera, diaphragmatic hernia, oedema, persistent truncus arteriosus, heart defects, 
small/absent lung, absent trachea, rib and vertebral abnormalities, malformed or absent structures in the 
appendicular skeleton (notably in the long bones). No developmental NOAEL was identified in any species. At 
the lowest embryotoxic and teratogenic dose levels, exposure ratios based on unbound AUC levels reached 
0.8 and 0.6 in rats and rabbits, respectively. It is noted that the TK data obtained from the 1-month toxicity 
rat study was used, since TK investigations were limited to the measure of drug concentration at 4 hours 
post-dose in the rat pEFD study. 
Reports of 3 alternative non-GLP developmental toxicity tests were submitted: a rat whole embryo culture 
assay, a zebrafish embryo-developmental assay, and a murine embryonic stem cell assay. Cyclopamine, a 
known SMO inhibitor, was used as a positive control.

with cyclopamine, and were confirmed further in rats and rabbits. 
Toxicokinetic data 
A summary of toxicokinetics data obtained during repeat-dose toxicity studies is provided below. The 
calculation of exposure margin between animals and humans is based on a human dose of 100mg/man 
resulting in an AUC0-24: 17200 ng.h/ml for glasdegib.

Local Tolerance  
Glasdegib was evaluated for the potential to cause local irritation when administered intravenously (IV) or 
perivascularly (PV) as a parenteral formulation to the ear of New Zealand White rabbits (Study 16GR159).  
Glasdegib and its parenteral vehicle formulation were well-tolerated when administered as a single IV or PV 
dose at 1 and 0.05 mg (at 1 mg/mL), respectively.  Glasdegib, as well as vehicle and saline did not cause 
local irritation or macroscopic and microscopic findings in rabbits when administered IV or PV at the doses 
tested.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  
An in vivo phototoxicity assay was conducted on pigmented rat in accordance with ICHS10 for API that bind 
to melanin. There were no test article-related effects on survival, clinical signs, skin reaction observations in 
pigmented and non-pigmented skin, body weights or ophthalmology observations. Mean systemic exposure 
(as assessed by mean Cmax and AUC24) increased with increasing dose of glasdegib in a greater than dose-
proportional manner. Once daily oral administration of glasdegib for 3 days to female Crl:LE (Long-Evans) 
rats at doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day followed by UVR exposure was not phototoxic based on the absence 
of effects in pigmented rats. At 100 mg/kg/day on Day 3, the mean Cmax was 14200 ng/mL and the mean 
AUC24 was 137000 ng•hr/mL. The irradiation of animals was conducted at the approximate Tmax and the 
dose that covers the range of NOAEL and MTD. Glasdegib absorbs at 290 and 320 nm in the range of natural 
sunlight and MEC value is above the threshold (1000 L mol-1 cm-1) only at 290 nm (study 2011045).  
Haemolysis 
In vitro haemolysis compatibility assay was performed with glasdegib (report 17GR182) to assess the whole 
blood and plasma compatibility with human donor blood, evaluating haemolysis and precipitation. There was 
no haemolysis of the whole blood and no precipitation of the plasma in the undiluted and diluted tubes. 
Glasdegib (0.01-1.0 mg/mL) does not cause haemolysis in human whole blood and is compatible with human 
donor plasma.

In order to justify omission of a Phase II ERA assessment of glasdegib, a thorough discussion on glasdegib 
teratogenic effects in terms of risk to organisms in the environment e.g. aquatic life was presented.  
1) 
Glasdegib is a known teratogen and nonclinical studies show that glasdegib does not directly interact 
or interfere with receptors of estrogens, androgens or other steroid hormones including thyroid and therefore 
cannot be classified as a classical endocrine disrupting substance. 
2) 
Although it cannot be concluded for certain, that fish full lifecycle studies of glasdegib will show that 
no feminisation will occur in the presence of glasdegib, a partial lifecycle early development study in zebrafish 
larvae incubated with glasdegib or cyclopamine from 6 hours post fertilisation for 5 days, showed a relatively 
low potency for morphological adverse effects for glasdegib compared with cyclopamine (study 15gr263). 
LOEC concentration for glasdegib was 30 µM and 0.78 µM for cyclopamine. It should be noted that tissue 
concentration at the LOEC was 291.8 ng/mL (30 μM or 11.2 mg/L in media) and 485.3 ng/mL (0.78 μM in 
media) for glasdegib and cyclopamine, respectively. Hence, bioaccumulation appeared much more 
pronounced for the naturally occurring steroid alkaloid cyclopamine as compared to glasdegib and tissue 
concentrations are in line with glasdegib plasma concentrations leading to malformation in rat embryofetal 
development studies (495 ng/mL). 
3) 
Glasdegib is much less potent than e.g. the known endocrine disruptor ethinylestradiol, which was 
shown to lead to feminisation of male zebrafish larvae at media concentrations as low as 1 ng/L (Örn et al, 
2003) compared to 14.7 mg/L of glasdegib leading to developmental malformations in zebrafish larvae. 
4) 
Glasdegib PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development program for glasdegib was designed in accordance with ICH S9 guideline, 
regarding the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and is considered sufficient to support the claimed 
indication for marketing authorization.  
The pharmacological profile of glasdegib was demonstrated in in vitro assays and in vivo model xenografted 
in rodents. The proof of concept was demonstrated, an anti-tumour activity is obvious as a combination of 
glasdegib with LDAC, however the mechanism of action of the combination is not fully known. The process of 
cell death could also not be completely demonstrated. Clinical data are currently collected to address these 
two points (see clinical part of the AR). 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 48/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of glasdegib have been thoroughly evaluated following 
intravenous and oral administration in rats and dogs, species used for pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies for this application are considered sufficient for the proposed 
indication.  
The toxicological profile of glasdegib has been evaluated during repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, 
genotoxicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies and phototoxicity. No further non-
clinical studies are requested in accordance with ICH S9 guideline. The toxicities observed in the general 
toxicity studies were consistent across studies and species and concerns kidney, liver, bone physis, teeth, 
skin, reproductive organs (testis) and peripheral nerves. Moreover, Qt prolongation was clearly demonstrated 
in vivo (see SmPC section 5.3). The telemetric study in beagle dogs highlighted cardiac effects and confirmed 
in vitro results by demonstrating a QTc prolongation in a dose-dependent manner. Heart rate corrected QT 
(QTc) interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with Daurismo at supratherapeutic dose (> 
270 mg) and therapeutic dose (100 mg with low-dose cytarabine), QTcF interval greater than 500 msec was 
reported in 6% of patients. Monitoring and dose modifications are recommended in the SmPC (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). 
Regarding reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, male patients treated with Daurismo are now 
advised to have sperm sample preserved and stored before treatment (see SPC sections 4.4 and 4.6) since 
non-reversible hypospermatogenesis was reported in rats without safety margin, a finding possibly driven by 
the pharmacological activity of glasdegib. A potential pharmacologically-mediated effect on female fertility 
with glasdegib is expected since nonclinical and clinical data available with other SMO inhibitors approved in 
Europe indicate potential adverse effects on this aspect. The Applicant’s approach to conduct GLP-compliant 
pEFD studies in rats and rabbits instead of full EFD studies is acceptable. Indeed, adverse embryo-foetal 
effects were expected in view of the significant role of hedgehog signalling in embryonic development, and 
the teratogenic potential of other authorized SMO inhibitors. These pEFD studies confirmed the embryo-
foetotoxic (including lethality) and teratogenic potential of glasdegib in both species. These malformations 
were reported at exposure levels lower than those reached in patients at the recommended dose of 100 
mg/day. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.4, 4.6 and as an important potential risk in the RMP / RMMs.  
Since glasdegib is intended for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML, no additional 
studies are requested in accordance with ICH S9. 
In general, the non-clinical findings are adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP and reported in the non-
clinical part of the RMP.   
An ERA was performed for glasdegib, the Log Kow of glasdegib exceeds 3 at pH 7; hence according to Q & A 
on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP, 2016), the 
Applicant was requested to provide evaluation of bioaccumulation or justification for not submitting such a 
study. In order to justify omission of a Phase II ERA assessment of glasdegib, a thorough discussion on 
glasdegib teratogenic effects in terms of risk to organisms in the environment, e.g. aquatic life was 
presented. The justification was accepted by the committee. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamics studies demonstrate anti-proliferative effects of glasdegib in combination with LDAC. 
The ADME profiles of glasdegib is well documented and performed in relevant species. The toxicological 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report

program, designed in accordance with ICH S9 guideline, allowed to draw main target organs toxicities in 
rodent and non-rodent species. The adverse effects are clearly identified in animals and reported in the RMP. 
The safety information is adequately reported in the SmPC 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3.  
Overall, the non-clinical package available with glasdegib, in line with ICH S9 guideline, is considered 
sufficient to support the marketing authorization for the proposed indication.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of glasdegib have been studied in 7 studies in healthy volunteers (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion, drug-drug interaction, QT, food effect and bioavailability). One study was 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 51/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
performed in subjects with renal impairment (B1371017). Single- and multiple-dose PK of glasdegib have 
been evaluated in 5 studies in adult patients with haematologic malignancies and solid tumours (B1371001, 
B1371002, B1371003, B1371005, and B1371012). Several bioanalytical methods were developed for the 
quantification of glasdegib in human plasma, in urine and human plasma:PBS matrix. In addition, for each 
drug product used in association with glasdegib during the clinical development program, a specific 
bioanalytical method was developed.  
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of glasdegib was estimated in Study B1371022 after oral administration of the 
proposed commercial maleate tablet formulation of glasdegib relative to glasdegib IV infusion administered to 
healthy adult volunteers after an overnight fast. 
The absolute oral bioavailability of the glasdegib-proposed commercial maleate tablet formulation was 
77.12% (71.83%, 82.81%) based on the AUCinf. Therefore, approximately 77% of the administered oral 
dose of glasdegib reached the systemic circulation after oral administration.

Bioequivalence 
Immediate-release di-HCl tablet formulations were the initial product presentation and were used in early 
clinical studies for clinical pharmacology, safety, and efficacy (B1371001, B1371002, B1371003, B1371005, 
B1371010, B1371012, B1371013, B1371014, and B1371026). An immediate-release maleate film-coated 
tablet formulation (Generation-1 maleate tablet), one with a drug loading of 13.11% maleate to provide a 10 
mg active dose and the other with a drug loading of 26.21% maleate to provide 25 and 100 mg were 
developed to support the phase I studies B1371014 (food effect and BE) and B1371015 (DDI). The 
formulation was further changed and the proposed commercial maleate formulation (to be marketed 
formulation) now contains 21.84% glasdegib maleate to make 25 mg an\d 100 mg active tablets and was 
used in the QTc study BE (B1371023) and in multiple dose study in patients with MDS/AML (B1371012) but 
not in the pivotal E/S trial. 
In total the applicant submitted 3 bioavailability and bioequivalence studies (B1371014, B1371026 and 
B1371022) in healthy subjects to allow bridging of the earlier data (generated with earlier formulations) to 
the to be marketed product. Two of these BE studies were intended to bridge the data from the phase 1/2b 
study B1371003 study.

Study B1371014 bridges the HCL salt formulation and the intermediary maleate formulation.  
Table 17. Study B1371014, Descriptive summary of plasma Glasdegib Pharmacokinetic 
Parameters. 
For the MFS tablet, the ratio (Test/Reference) of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) of glasdegib AUCinf and 
Cmax were 105.10% (101.20%, 109.14%) and 107.42% (102.41%, 112.66%), respectively, relative to the 
di-HCl reference tablet. The corresponding 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax ratios 
were wholly contained within the acceptance range for bioequivalence (80%, 125%). The median Tmax values 
were 1.0 hour each for both the MFS tablet and the di-HCl reference tablet. The mean apparent terminal plasma 
half-life (t½) was similar for the 2 treatments with mean values of 15.6 hours and 16.0 hours for MFS tablet 
and di-HCl tablet, respectively. 
For the MFL tablet, the ratio (Test/Reference) of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) of glasdegib AUCinf and 
Cmax were 107.51% (103.67%, 111.48%) and 107.77% (101.32%, 114.64%), respectively, relative to the 
di-HCl reference tablet. The corresponding 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax ratios 
were contained within the acceptance range for bioequivalence (80%, 125%). 
Study B1371026 compares the final 100 mg maleate tablet against the 100 mg di-HCl tablet.

Table 18. Study B1371026, Statistical summary of treatment comparison for plasma Glasdegib 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters – Bioequivalence. 
Studies B1371014 and 1026 showed bioequivalence between glasdegib maleate salt tablet with small 
particle size (MFS) relative to di-HCl tablet for the first study, and between glasdegib 100 mg ICH commercial 
maleate tablet formulation and 100 mg di-HCl tablet formulation for the second study.  
Distribution 
Study B1371009 was the mass balance study. The overall mean mass balance of the dosed radioactivity in 
the excreta was 90.64% over the 288-hour study, with recovery in individual subjects ranging from 89.1% to 
93.5%.  
The glasdegib geometric mean (geometric percent coefficient of variation [%CV]) apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) was 188 (20) L following single dose of 100 mg glasdegib in patients with haematologic 
malignancies. Distribution volume ranged from 270 L to 455 L, with population estimates of a steady state 
apparent volume of distribution of approximately 282.5 L. In humans, Glasdegib mean fu was 0.0899, and 
mean Cb/Cp values was 1.38 (1.36 to 1.49 in Study B1371009).  
This data suggests that glasdegib demonstrated a modest preferential distribution into the blood cells. 
Elimination 
Average CL/F ranged from 5.22 to 14.81 L/h, terminal half-life averaged 20 – 24 hours. The geometric mean 
(geometric %CV) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of glasdegib was 7.63 (20) L/hr after single dose 
administration of 100 mg glasdegib and 6.45 (25) L/hr after multiple doses of 100 mg QD of glasdegib. The 
mean ± standard deviation (SD) terminal plasma half-life was 17.4 ± 3.66 hours after single dose of 100 mg 
glasdegib in patients with selected haematologic malignancies. 
The overall mean mass balance of the dosed radioactivity in the excreta was 90.64% over the 288-hour 
study, with recovery in individual subjects ranging from 89.1% to 93.5%. Excretion was shared between 
urinary and faecal pathways, 48.9% and 41.7% of elimination respectively. Unchanged glasdegib recovered 
in the urine and feces accounted for 17.2% and 19.5% of the dose, respectively, indicating that excretion 
plays a role in elimination of glasdegib.

Following oral administration of a single dose of [14C] glasdegib to healthy subjects in Mass balance study 
B1371009, glasdegib was extensively metabolized, with the primary metabolic pathways comprising of N-
demethylation, glucuronidation, oxidation, and dehydrogenation. The primary CYP enzymes involved in the 
oxidative metabolism of glasdegib were CYP3A4 (60% to 80%) and CYP2C8 (2% to 20%). For the minor 
glucuronidation pathway, UGT1A9 was the predominant enzyme involved in the glucuronidation of glasdegib. 
In plasma, the N-desmethyl and N-glucuronide metabolites of glasdegib accounted for 7.9% and 7.2% of the 
circulating radioactivity, respectively. Other metabolites in plasma individually accounted for <5% of 
circulating radioactivity. The N-desmethyl metabolite of glasdegib was the most abundant metabolite in urine 
and faeces, accounting for 16.8% and 9.2% of dose respectively. The N-glucuronide metabolite of glasdegib 
was observed in urine, accounting for 4.2% of dose. Other metabolites in the excreta individually accounted 
for ≤5% of dose.

Additional sites of metabolism identified in human plasma and excreta included mono-oxidation in the 
benzimidazole ring, mono-oxidation and dehydrogenation in the piperidine ring and mono-oxidation in the 
benzonitrile group. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality following single and multiple escalating glasdegib doses was evaluated in the Phase 1 
dose-escalation trials in patients with select advanced hematologic malignancies (Studies B1371001 and 
B1371005) and advanced solid tumors (Study B1371002). 
Plasma exposure of glasdegib is dose proportional over the dose range of 5 mg to 640 mg QD, indicating 
dose-linear PK.

oral dose) in patients with advanced haematologic malignancies (Study B1371001).

Time dependency 
In Study B1371001, CL/F stayed similar after multiple dosing, showing time independence. Rss indicated no 
unexpected accumulation. In Study B1371002, steady state was reached at Day 8, and the accumulation 
ratio from 1.35 to 1.75 was consistent with a T1/2 around 20h. In Study B1371005: the accumulation ratio 
was also as expected. 
There is no time dependency of glasdegib PK, and a QD dosing should result in 1.6 to 2.6 fold accumulation. 
Intra and Inter-individual variability 
For the di-HCl tablet formulation, inter-subject variability ranged from 26% to 35% for AUCinf and from 23% 
to 41% for Cmax, across the studies assessed here. For the maleate tablet formulations (Generation-1 and 
proposed commercial maleate tablets), inter-subject variability ranged from 20% to 42% for AUCinf and from 
25% to 34% for Cmax, across the studies. 
PK in target populations 
Single and multiple dose PK in patient population has been evaluated in 5 studies, including 4 in patients with 
haematological malignancies (B1371001, B1371003, B1371005 and B1371012) and 1 study in patients with 
solid tumours (B1371002). Following repeated 100 mg QD dosing to steady state, glasdegib median time to 
first occurrence of the maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) ranged from approximately 1.3 
hours to 4.1 hours (Studies B1371003, B1371005, and B1371012). 
In study B1371003 the PK was evaluated in the AML patient population in combination with LDAC as 
proposed in the label. At the 100 mg once daily glasdegib dose, the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of 
variation, %CV) of glasdegib Cmax was 1,252 ng/mL (44%) and AUCtau was 17,210 ng•hr/mL (54%) in 
phase 2 of this study. The mean plasma half-life of glasdegib was 17.4 ± 3.66 hours after a single dose of 
100 mg glasdegib in patients.  
The POPPK dataset contains data from 2 studies in adult patients with selected advanced haematologic 
malignancies (n=47 in Study B1371001 and n=202 in Study B1371003) and 1 study in patients with 
advanced solid tumours (n=23 in Study B1371002). Glasdegib PK was well characterized by a 2-
compartment model with first order absorption. Baseline percent bone marrow blasts (BPBL), weight 
normalized clearance (WNCL), and use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors were statistically significant 
covariates on CL/F retained in the final model. Tumour type (i.e., solid tumours) was a statistically significant 
covariate on Vp/F and apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q/F).  
In order to evaluate the magnitude of effect of BPBL on CL/F, values of CL/F were calculated at extreme BPBL 
values (i.e., 10th and 90th percentiles in the analysis population) and compared with their typical values at a 
median BPBL of 38.2%. A 1% change in BPBL from the median value would result in an estimated 0.4% 
change in glasdegib CL/F, which is not clinically meaningful. Relative to the typical value of CL/F of 6.27 L/hr, 
CL/F increased by approximately 9% for an individual with 15% BPBL (10th percentile). CL/F decreased by 
approximately 17% for an individual with 83% BPBL (90th percentile).  
Tumour type was also identified as a statistically significant covariate on both Vp/F and Q/F in the final POPPK 
model. Patients with solid tumours had approximately 83% and 65% lower glasdegib Vp/F and Q/F compared 
to patients with haematologic malignancies.

Special populations 
Renal impairment  
In the clinical study B1371017, exposure was doubled in subjects with moderate and severe impaired renal 
function following a single 100 mg dose of glasdegib, 105% and 102% increase in AUCinf and 37% and 20% 
increase in Cmax were noted in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to subjects 
with normal renal function, respectively.  
The effect of renal function on the glasdegib CL/F was evaluated using WNCL in a population PK analysis. 
Data from 269 patients included 105 patients with normal renal function (BCCL ≥90 mL/min), 102 patients 
with mild renal impairment (BCCL 60-89 mL/min), and 61 patients with moderate renal impairment (BCCL 
30-59 mL/min). No patient met the criteria for severe renal impairment (BCCL 15-2 mL/min). 
In population PK modeling, baseline creatinine clearance (WNCL) was a statistically significant predictor of 
variability in CL/F. In order to evaluate the magnitude of effect of WNCL on CL/F, values of CL/F were 
calculated at extreme WNCL values (i.e., 10th and 90th percentiles in the analysis population) and compared 
with their typical values at a median WNCL of 71.2 mL/min. Relative to the typical value of CL/F of 6.27 L/hr 
for a patient with WNCL of 71.2 mL/min, CL/F decreased by approximately 16% for an individual with 
reduced WNCL of 46.9 mL/min (10th percentile). CL/F increased by approximately 19% for an individual with 
WNCL of 110 mL/min (90th percentile).  
Hepatic impairment 
Data  from  a  dedicated  pharmacokinetic  trial  (B13711016)  have  shown  that  plasma  exposures  for  total 
glasdegib (AUCinf and Cmax) were similar between the normal hepatic function group and the moderate hepatic 
impairment group (Child-Pugh Class B), whilst geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax values were 24% and 42% 
lower, respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Child-Pugh Class C), compared to the normal 
hepatic function group. The glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) in subjects with moderate or severe 
hepatic  impairment  was  increased  by  18%  and  16%,  respectively,  relative  to  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function.  Peak  glasdegib  unbound  exposure  (unbound  Cmax)  increased  by  1%,  for  moderate  hepatic 
impairment  and  decreased  by  11%  for  severe  hepatic  impairment,  relative  to  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function.  
Baseline body weight  
Baseline body weight (BW) was incorporated on CL/F and Q/F in the Pop PK  model based on the simulated 
glasdegib exposures data (AUCtau and Cmax), an over-exposure of 1.7-fold is expected for the extreme low 
BW values of 40 kg and an under-exposure of 0.6 fold is expected for the extreme high BW values of 140 kg 
compared  to  a  typical  patient  of  70  kg.  However,  these  exposures  differences  are  found  to  be  within  the 
therapeutic window for glasdegib [the upper boundary threshold was set to 2-fold increase for Cmax and 2.4-
fold increase for AUC; and the lower boundary is 0.5-fold for AUC and Cmax]. Furthermore, population PKPD 
exposure-responses analyses demonstrated no meaningful impact of BW on the efficacy (OS) and key safety 
endpoints.  
Age, sex, race 
No clinically relevant effects of age, sex, or race on glasdegib PK were observed.

Influence of food 
Studies B1371010, B1371014, and B1371026 investigated the effect of food on glasdegib PK. The AUCinf and 
Cmax decreased 0.87 and 0.66 fold, respectively, as compared to administration under overnight fasted 
conditions, for di-HCl tablets.

Glasdegib effect on other drugs 
Study  XT135086  aims  to  investigate  the  potential  for  PF-04449913  (glasdegib)  to  inhibit  cytochrome  P450 
(CYP)  1A2,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6  and  3A4/5  activities  in  vitro,  using  pooled  human  liver  microsomes 
(HLM). PF-04449913 did not appear to cause time-dependent or metabolism-dependent inhibition of any CYP 
enzyme  activity  examined  since  there  was  less  than  a  20%  increase  in  inhibition  observed  after  94  μM  PF-
04449913 was preincubated with human liver microsomes in either the presence or absence of NADPH for 30 
minutes.

Study  XT133102  aimed  to  investigate  the  potential  of  PF-04449913  to  induce  CYP3A4  and  CYP2B6  in  vitro 
using freshly plated human hepatocytes (Lot H1182) and cryopreserved human hepatocytes (Lots Hu1434 and 
Hu8148). Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were observed for the known CYP3A4 inducer rifampin, as measured 
by testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity and CYP3A4 mRNA levels, and the known CYP1A2 inducer omeprazole. 
Treatment of the human hepatocytes with PF-04449913 did not cause induction of CYP3A4, 2B6 and 1A2. 
Other drugs on glasdegib PK  
Clinical studies in healthy volunteers were conducted to assess the impact of other drugs such as CYP3A4 
inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer on glasdegib PK. 
The effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors (Study B1371010) and inducers (Study B1371015) as well as agents that 
increase gastric pH, was evaluated in studies in HVs. Potential for DDI of glasdegib with LDAC was assessed 
in the patients with haematologic malignancies. 
A 40% increase (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 139.54% [123.51%, 157.64%]) in glasdegib Cmax and a 
140% increase (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 239.84% [214.70%, 267.93%]) in glasdegib AUCinf were 
noted in a DDI study conducted with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), confirming the involvement of 
CYP3A4 in glasdegib metabolism (Study B1371010).

A 35% decrease (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 64.71% [57.21%, 73.19%]) in glasdegib Cmax and a 70% 
decrease (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 29.66% [26.17%, 33.62%]) in glasdegib AUCinf were noted in 
clinical DDI study conducted with rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer), confirming the involvement of CYP3A4 in 
glasdegib metabolism (Study B1371015).

rifampin (Study B1371015). 
Coadministration of multiple 40 mg QD doses of rabeprazole, a PPI, resulted in a 20% decrease in glasdegib 
Cmax (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 80.46% [70.68%, 91.59%]) relative to those when glasdegib was 
administered alone. However, no change in glasdegib AUCinf (geometric mean ratio [90% CI]: 100.58% 
[93.19%, 108.55%]) was observed (Studies B1371014, B1371026).

In Study B1371014, a food effect was observed: decrease of Cmax by 0.75 fold on MFL formulation in fed 
state. In Study B1371026, food effect and PPI effect could be detected: decrease of 0.7 fold of Cmax in fed 
state as compared to fasted state, and with coadministration of PPI as compared as without PPI, for 100 mg 
ICH commercial maleate tablet formulation. 
There was no evidence of DDI between glasdegib and LDAC when the 2 drugs were coadministered as non-
intensive treatment in patients with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS (Study B1371003).

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Study  PF04449913_28Jul15_154108 aimed  to  determine  the  inhibitory  potency  of  glasdegib  for  human 
multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR 1, P-gp), human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), human hepatic 
organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, human organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3, 
human  organic  cation transporter  (OCT)  2,  human multidrug  and  toxin  extrusion proteins  (MATE)  1  and  2K

OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K from study PF04449913_28Jul15_154108. 
Glasdegib inhibits MDR1/P-gp and BCRP with an estimated Ki (16.7 µM for P-gp and 2.3 µM for BCRP), and 
IC50 of 33.3 µM and 4.6 µM respectively. There was concentration-dependent inhibition of hepatic OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 by glasdegib up to 300 μM. The estimated IC50 for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was 26.3 and 25.9 
µM, respectively. There was no concentration-dependent inhibition of renal OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 by 
glasdegib from 0.012 up to 50 μM. The estimated IC50 for glasdegib against OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 was 
>50, >50, and >50 μM, respectively. There was concentration-dependent inhibition of renal efflux 
transporter MATE1 and MATE2K by glasdegib from 0.012 up to 50 μM. The estimated IC50 for glasdegib 
against MATE1 and MATE2K was 4.9 and 1.2 μM, respectively. 
Glasdegib potential for inhibition of selected UGTs was evaluated in human liver microsomes. Glasdegib 
showed a minor potential for inhibition of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. 
The extent of in vitro binding of glasdegib to human plasma proteins and non-clinical species was determined 
using an equilibrium dialysis method at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 microM, depending on the 
species. Glasdegib was moderately to highly bound to plasma proteins in all species evaluated. Binding was 
independent of drug concentration. The glasdegib mean fu values are 0.0899 in human. 
The in vitro binding of glasdegib (at 2 μM) to human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha-1 glycoprotein (AAG) 
was determined at physiological concentrations for these proteins. Glasdegib was moderately bound to both 
HSA (mean fu of 0.204) and AAG (mean fu of 0.478), which suggests that glasdegib likely binds to both HSA 
and AAG in human plasma 
The extent of glasdegib partitioning into blood cells was determined in human whole blood and other species 
over a concentration range of 0.2 to 50 microM. In human whole blood the partitioning of glasdegib was 
independent of concentration and the mean Cb/Cp value was 1.38, respectively. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Relevant data on exposure of Glasdegib after repeated dose of 100 mg once daily, at steady state, in 
patients, could be found in Studies B1371003, B1371005, B1371012 and B1371013.  
Average AUC0-tau,ss ranged from 13150 ng/mL (CV 50%) to 19170 (CV 61%), and Cmax,ss ranged from 
996.8 ng.hr/mL (CV 45%) to 1718 ng.hr/mL (CV 28%).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Glasdegib is a small molecule inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, administered orally. Binding of the Sonic, 
Indian, or Desert Hh ligands to the transmembrane receptor patched allows activation of the glioma-associated 
oncogene  homolog  1  and  2  (GLI1  and  GLI2)  transcriptional  regulators,  and  modulation  of  target  gene 
expression  through  SMO-mediated  signalling.  Glasdegib  is  an  inhibitor  of  the Hh  signaling  pathway  through 
binding to the target, SMO (Smoothened), resulting in down-regulation of GLI1, a marker of pathway activation. 
Skin biopsies were obtained from patients in 3 studies (B1371001, B1371002 and B1371005). Samples were 
collected at different doses of glasdegib (25 mg to 640 mg QD). Normal skin punch biopsies were obtained 
from patients at Screening and following repeated daily dosing to steady state. Skin samples were analyzed 
for treatment related changes in the ribonucleic acid transcript levels of Hh pathway regulated genes.

exposure (Studies B1371001, B1371002 and B1371005). 
The results of this analysis showed down-regulation of GLI1 expression at most dose levels, with similar effect 
on expression observed at 100 mg QD and higher dose levels, up to 640 mg. Consistent down regulation of 
GLI1 expression was also observed at the 50 mg QD dose. 
No dedicated primary PD study has been submitted.

Secondary pharmacology 
Dose rationale - Maximum Tolerated Dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose determination 
The number of DLTs reported at each glasdegib dose-escalating level during Cycle 1 of the first in man (FIH) 
study in patients with selected advanced haematologic malignancies (Study B1371001) is summarized in 
Table 24. 
Table 24. Summary of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (Study B1371001). 
Out of the 41 DLT evaluable patients, 2 patients (1 patient each in the 80 mg and the 600 mg groups) 
experienced DLTs during Cycle 1. The patient in the 80 mg group experienced non-hematologic DLTs of 
hypoxia and pleural effusion. In response to the hypoxia DLT, which was also considered as an SAE, dosing 
with the study drug was interrupted temporarily, and then the dose reduced. The patient also received a 
blood transfusion. The patient in the 600 mg group experienced a non-haematologic DLT of peripheral 
oedema which was also considered as an SAE. In response to the SAE, the study drug was stopped 
temporarily. All the 3 DLTs experienced by both patients were Grade 3 in severity and considered to be 
related to the study drug. 
In addition, 3 patients (1 patient in the 400 mg group and 2 patients in the 600 mg group) had a post-
baseline maximum QTcF interval of ≥500 msec and 6 patients (1 from the 5 mg group and 5 from the 600 
mg group) had a maximum QTcF increase from baseline of ≥60 msec. 
The MTD was defined as 400 mg once daily after considering the DLT and QTc prolongation data.  
The RP2D of glasdegib was defined as 200 mg once daily (or less) based on the following factors: 
• 
Efficacy observed across a broad range of doses (10 to 600 mg once daily). 
•  Confirmation of the MTD as 400 mg once daily. 
•  An oedema DLT event and QTc prolongation events observed at 600 mg once daily. 
• 
• 
In the FIH study (B1371001), PD data in surrogate tissue was available at the 120 mg, 180 mg and 
270 mg dose levels. The data showed down regulation of GLI1 expression at all three dose levels. 
Additionally, comparable PD data from solid tumour study B1371002 showed pathway knockdown at 
doses of 80 mg and above. 
To provide additional safety margin with respect to possible increased exposures resulting from 
potential drug-drug interactions.

Genetic differences in PD response - Mutational analysis 
Pharmacodynamics data relative to the claimed population have been assessed in the pivotal B1371003 
Phase 1b/2 study. In the part 2 phase, 88 unfit patients were included in baseline mutational analyses of 
bone marrow and/or peripheral blood, including 61 patients who received glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and 27 
patients who received LDAC alone (Table 24).  
For the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm, clinical responses were evident across patients with diverse 
mutational profiles, including mutations in all 12 genes reported, with the exception of KRAS (only 2 
instances in non-responders). The most commonly mutated genes in responding patients were RUNX1, IDH1 
and TET2 (10 of 21 [47.6%], 5 of 21 [23.8%] and 7 of 21 [33.3%] responding patients, respectively), which 
likely reflects their overall high incidence in this patient population (28/61 [45.9%], 10/61 [16.4%] and 
15/61 [24.6%] patients, respectively, in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm). No significant correlations were 
evident between mutational status of any of the individual 12 reported genes and clinical response, although 
there was non-significant trend suggesting a relationship between DNMT3A mutations and lack of response 
(DNMT3A mutations in 2/21 [9.5%] responders and 13/40 [32.5%] non-responders, p-value = 0.063 using 
Fisher’s Exact test). This trend may reflect the known association of DNMT3A mutations with poor outcome in 
AML. For the LDAC alone arm, the overall spectrum of mutations evidence was similar to the glasdegib 
100 mg + LDAC arm, but no meaningful assessment of potential correlations with response was feasible, 
since there was only 1 responding patient among 27 patients evaluable for mutational status.

•  Correlation of glasdegib pharmacokinetics with efficacy endpoints 
Treatment-Response (T-R) and Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis have been done on data from the patients 
randomized in the non-intensive chemotherapy arm in the part 2 of the B1371003 pivotal study. 
For the Treatment-Response (T-R) analysis, glasdegib + LDAC treatment arm appeared to be a statistically 
significant predictor of OS globally. The absence of glasdegib treatment (eg., LDAC alone) was associated 
with shorter OS. Indeed, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.32-0.67) for glasdegib + LDAC arm 
versus LDAC alone arm. Additional exploratory T-R for the AML subpopulation was also conducted for OS. The 
median HR (95% CI) was 0.42 (0.28-0.66) for glasdegib + LDAC treatment versus LDAC alone which is 
similar to the HR for OS calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model and reported in Study B1371003 
[HR 0.46 (95% CI: 0.30-0.72)]. These results support the benefit of adding glasdegib to non-intensive 
chemotherapy, LDAC, in patients with AML who are not eligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. Patient 
demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, baseline weight), disease characteristics (e.g., de novo or 
secondary, cytogenetic risk, baseline ECOG performance status), prior treatment with a hypomethylating 
agent, and baseline safety laboratory values (e.g., BCCL, BAST, baseline white blood cells [BWBC], BPBL, 
baseline percent peripheral blasts [BBPL]) were formally evaluated as potential predictors of OS. No other 
covariates, aside from treatment arm, were identified as significant predictors of OS in this analysis.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 70/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
For the Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis in the AML subpopulation, patients with AML in the Phase 2 
glasdegib + LDAC treatment arm were randomized to receive 100 mg of glasdegib; dose reductions were 
permitted. Time- independent exposure metrics were selected for formal evaluation in the E-R analysis for OS 
(e.g., cycle 1 first dose maximum concentration, end of Cycle 1 maximum concentration, end of Cycle 1 
minimum trough concentration, overall average concentration) based on the distribution of the average 
glasdegib dose administered during treatment and glasdegib plasma exposure parameters. None of the 
tested glasdegib exposure metric was identified as a significant predictor of OS. Patient demographic 
characteristics (e.g., age, sex, baseline weight), disease characteristics (e.g., de novo or secondary, 
cytogenetic risk, baseline ECOG performance status), prior treatment with a hypomethylating agent, and 
baseline safety laboratory values (e.g., BCCL, BAST, BWBC, BPBL, BBPL) were also formally evaluated as 
potential predictors of OS with none identified as significant predictors of OS. 
No dedicated study assessing relationship between plasma concentration and effect has been submitted. 
Treatment-Response (T-R) and Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis have been done on data from the patients 
randomized in the non-intensive chemotherapy arm in the part 2 of the B1371003 pivotal study. Therefore, 
only the dose of glasdegib of 100 mg was assessed. No E-R relationship was observed between glasdegib 
plasma exposure and efficacy endpoint (OS) in patients with previously untreated AML with the glasdegib 
dose evaluated.  
•  Correlation of glasdegib pharmacokinetics with safety endpoints 
Exposure-Response relationships for safety endpoints were examined using data from studies in patients with 
advanced hematologic malignancies or solid tumours treated with glasdegib over a dose range of 5 to 
640 mg once daily (Studies B1371001, B1371002 and B1371003) (PMAR-783). The population consisted of 
181 males and 91 females with a median (range) age of 69.0 (25.0-92.0) years old and median (range) 
baseline body weight of 78.6 (43.5-146) kg. The following E-R relationships for safety endpoints were 
identified: dysgeusia, muscle spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolonged.  
•  Correlation of glasdegib pharmacokinetics with electrocardiogram data 
In the thorough QT (TQT) study in 36 healthy subjects treated with glasdegib, at steady state therapeutic 
plasma concentrations (achieved with a 150 mg single dose), the largest mean QTc interval change was 8.03 
msec. The highest 90% CI upper bound for the largest, placebo- and baseline-adjusted QTcF change was 
10.22 msec at 4 hours post dose. At supra-therapeutic exposure, the highest 90% CI upper bound for the 
largest, placebo and baseline-adjusted QTcF change was 15.61 msec at 3 hours post dose. The upper bound 
of the 2-sided 90% CIs for all time-matched least square (LS) mean differences between glasdegib and 
placebo was below 20 msec. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of glasdegib has been studied in 7 studies in healthy volunteers (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion, drug-drug interaction, QT, food effect and bioavailability), and in 1 study in 
subjects with renal impairment (B1371017). Single- and multiple-dose PK of glasdegib has been evaluated in 
5 studies in adult patients with haematologic malignancies and solid tumours (B1371001, B1371002, 
B1371003, B1371005, and B1371012). The overall pharmacology package is considered sufficiently extensive 
to allow for a detailed assessment of PK in the populations studied.

As the Applicant developed 3 glasdegib formulations, two bridging studies have been performed to 
demonstrate bioequivalence between the generation 1 maleate tablet and the reference di-HCl tablet, and 
between the commercial maleate tablet (to be marketed) and the reference di-HCl tablet. The three different 
formulations are well bridged, and as PK of glasdegib can be proven linear from 5 to 680 mg, this can extend 
to tablets of lower strengths (studies used di-HCl tablet at 5, 10, 25, 100g strength, and maleate tablets at 
20 and 100 mg). Bioequivalence to the di-HCl formulation is shown and is considered of critical importance, 
as all early clinical studies as well as the pivotal B1371003 study have only been performed with this 
formulation and results from these studies are considered valid also for the commercial formulation.  
Studies in healthy subjects following single dose and studies in patients following single- and multiple dose 
administrations showed that glasdegib AUCinf and Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner over the 
dose range of 5 mg to 600 mg (the proposed dose is 100 mg taken orally once daily).  
Following 100 mg oral administration absolute bioavailability was 77%. Glasdegib is highly bound to human 
plasma proteins. In line with applicant’s responses in can be agreed that no significant impact on the 
unbound systemic exposures of glasdegib in e.g. patients with renal and hepatic impairment (mean free 
fraction of 9%) is expected. The glasdegib mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 188 L (20%) 
following a single dose of 100 mg glasdegib. The primary metabolic pathways for glasdegib are comprised of 
N-demethylation, glucoronidation, oxidation and dehydrogenation. CYP3A4 is the primary metabolizing 
enzyme (60 to 80%) with minor contributions by CYP2C8 (2 to 20%) and UGT1A9. A mass balance study 
B1371009 investigated metabolism and metabolites of glasdegib, showing that unchanged glasdegib was the 
major component in human plasma (69.4%), with N-desmethyl and N-glucoronide glasdegib metabolites 
accounted for 7.9% and 7.2% of the circulating radioactivity, respectively and other metabolites accounted 
for less than 5% individually. Oxidative metabolism was the major route of glasdegib elimination with minor 
contributions from glucuronidation. Inter-conversion is not a risk for glasdegib. 
The geometric mean (geometric %CV) oral clearance (CL/F) of glasdegib was 7.63 (20) L/hr after single dose 
administration of 100 mg glasdegib and 6.45 (25) L/hr after multiple doses of 100 mg QD of glasdegib. About 
17.2% and 19.5% of the administered dose were excreted unchanged in urine and faeces. The geometric 
mean CL is 1.97 L/hr and mean half-life is 17.4 ± 3.7 hours. Accumulation of glasdegib observed in human 
plasma following continuous QD dosing was consistent with the plasma half-life of the drug (see SmPC 
section 5.2).  
PK parameters were also evaluated in an adequate number of patients, treated with multiple doses of 
glasdegib. In patients, median tmax following a single dose of glasdegib is around 2 hrs and after multiple 
doses between 1.3 and 1.8 hrs (Study B1371003), which is comparable to results from the healthy 
volunteers (HV) studies. The exposure was higher in the patient population with higher Cmax and AUC 
values, while a lower Cl was found in patients compared to HV; ~12L/hr compared to ~6L/hr in HV. The 
glasdegib geometric mean plasma Cmax values in healthy volunteers ranged from 561 ng/mL to 890 ng/mL 
across studies, while the geometric mean AUCinf values ranged from 7628 ng•hr/mL to 9599 ng•hr/mL after 
a single 100mg dose. In study B1371005 the geometric mean Cmax and AUCinf in patients were 1019 ng/mL 
and 13119 ng•hr/mL, respectively. 
Differences in exposure between the target patient population and healthy volunteers are likely due to 
subject characteristics; the patient population is comprised of elderly subjects with a naturally lower kidney 
function. Due to the decreased renal function, clearance of glasdegib is likely lower which could result in 
higher exposure.

PK characterisation in the target population is considered essential for this submission and relevant 
pharmacology studies were conducted with patients, the PK data generated in healthy volunteers are 
considered supportive with this regard. Of note, 98% of patients included in the PK studies were > 65 years 
of age. According to the proposed indication (section 4.1 of the SmPC) glasdegib is indicated for adult AML 
patients, not only elderly patients. While it could be speculated that PK characteristics of glasdegib in younger 
AML patients are comparable to the HV PK profiles, this has not been formally investigated or discussed by 
the Applicant and also only mainly considers underlying differences in renal clearance as underlying cause, 
but not other possible (disease) characteristics. However, it is acknowledged that, for the assessment of 
safety (of exposure), it has advantages to investigate it in a ‘worst case’ population. The ADME of glasdegib 
in patients > 65 years has been characterised and is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
PK curve characteristics are comparable between HVs and patients, also for combination therapy with LDAC. 
The population modelling is well detailed. During assessment timeline, some deficiencies were addressed. 
Although the inclusion of BPBL on CL/F was statistically significant, the effect of BPBL is not considered to be 
clinically relevant and dose adjustment based on this laboratory value is not warranted. While the reason for 
this difference is not known, the impact of this difference is not clinically relevant given that the exposure 
observed in solid tumour versus haematologic patients was similar. Hence, glasdegib dose adjustment based 
on tumour type is not warranted. A residual variability of 59.5 and 65.7% (proportional error) was estimated 
for glasdegib in patients. Moreover, a high shrinkage is observed for Vp/F, Q and Ka. However, taking into 
account the overall model adequacy (GOF, VPC, precision of PK parameter estimates) and the fact that the 
model parameter estimates were in line with parameters reported through non-compartmental analyses in 
formal PK studies, the issues are not pursued. PK in the target population appears to be not significantly 
different from PK in healthy volunteers. Overall, the final POPPK model described the observed data 
reasonably well, and the predictive capability of the final POPPK model was validated through different 
approaches. The inter-subject variability is around 30% with the proposed dose. 
Food intake decreased plasma exposure of glasdegib, AUCinf by 16% and Cmax by 31%. Tmax was delayed 
between 0-3 hrs, while half-life time was similar. According to the proposed SmPC section 5.2 glasdegib can 
be administered irrespective of food intake and this rule was also applied in the clinical studies as the impact 
of food on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib is not considered clinically relevant.  
Possible genetic polymorphisms are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence, as the prevalence of 
CYP3A4*22 polymorphism is low and the safety margin of glasdegib was established up to doses of 400mg. 
Glasdegib is not metabolised by pathways that are at risk for possible genetic polymorphism. 
Five modelling reports were submitted to support various aspects of the submission; one pop-PK model to 
describe the kinetic behaviour of glasdegib, two PK/PD models to assess the effect of glasdegib on QT 
intervals (one in HVs and one in patients), one PK/PD model for Exposure-Response Analysis for Efficacy and 
one PK/PD model for Exposure-Response Analysis for safety. The models are built based on data generated 
(and submitted) by the Applicant for this development. They serve as additional source of information to 
describe glasdegib properties and performance for regulatory scrutiny and are considered as supporting 
documentation.  
Special populations 
One study has been performed in patients with renal impairment (Study B1371017). Glasdegib plasma 
exposure was about 2-fold higher in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to 
subjects with normal renal function. The applicant justified that the 2-fold increase in AUCinf for glasdegib 
100 mg observed in Study B1371017 was similar for subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 73/143   
 
  
 
 
which corresponds to equivalent plasma exposures as the 200 mg dose, which is still 50% lower than the 
MTD for glasdegib. Peak glasdegib exposure (Cmax) increased by 37%, and 20% for subjects with moderate, 
and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function (see SmPC section 
5.2). These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. PK results from the renal impaired study are 
comparable to the studies in AML patients, these patients were largely elderly patients, also with slightly 
decreased renal function. No dose adjustment is recommended by the Applicant which is accepted.  
Data from a dedicated pharmacokinetic trial have shown that plasma exposures for total glasdegib (AUCinf 
and Cmax) were similar between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), whilst geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax values were 24% and 42% lower, 
respectively, for subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), compared to the normal 
hepatic function group. The glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) is increased by 18% and 16% in 
subjects with moderate and severe impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic 
function. Peak glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) increased by 1%, for moderate hepatic 
impairment and decreased by 11% for severe hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic 
function. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant (see SmPC section 5.2).  
In the pooled POP-PK analysis, no clinically relevant effects of age, sex, race, or body weight on glasdegib PK 
were  observed,  supporting  the  fixed  dose  approach.  Simulated  data  (popPK)  support  the  assumption  that 
results are applicable also for patients < 65 years, however, the amount of observed data is small. The proposal 
of the applicant that no dose modifications are necessary based on BW are acceptable. 
Daurismo should not be used in paediatric patients, therefore no additional data are necessary. 
The exposure-response relationship between glasdegib and selected safety endpoints including dysgeusia, 
muscle spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolongation needs to be further discussed. 
In a QT study glasdegib exhibited concentration dependent QT-prolongation. The highest 90% CI upper bound 
for the largest, placebo- and baseline-adjusted QTcF change was 10.22 msec at 4 hours post dose. A negative 
QTc study according to ICH E14 criteria shows an upper one-sided 95% CI of the QTc effect of less than 10 
msec. At supra-therapeutic exposure, the highest 90% CI upper bound for the largest, placebo and baseline-
adjusted QTcF change was 15.61 msec at 3 hours post dose (i.e. an effect on QTc of less than 20, but more 
than 10 msec). In categorical terms, none of the subjects met the criterion of absolute QTcF interval of ≥480 
msec  or  increase  from  baseline  in  QTcF  interval  ≥30  msec  after  receiving  any  treatment;  but  2  subjects  on 
glasdegib and 1 on moxafloxacin had a QTcF interval between 450 and 480 msec. ECG QT prolonged has been 
added to the ADR table in the SmPC section 4.8 and section 4.2 and 4.4 for dose modification and management 
of adverse reactions, respectively; this is considered sufficient. The TQT study has been added in section 5.1 
of the SmPC and QT prolongation has been identified as potential risk in the RMP. 
Interactions 
Two DDI studies (B1371014 & B1371026) have been performed in healthy volunteers to investigate the 
effect of CYP3A4 modulators on glasdegib PK. AUCinf of glasdegib increased 140% and Cmax 40% in 
combination with a strong CYP inhibitor, while AUCinf decreased 70% and Cmax 35% in combination with a 
CYP inducer. Based on data from the in-vivo studies, a Pop-PK model was used to test the influence of CYPs 
on glasdegib PK, and again it was found to be a significant co-variate. Results from the clinical studies are 
summarised in the SmPC section 4.5. As concomitant use of CYP inhibitors is medically necessary, the 
influence was considered in the dose finding. Caution should be used when administering concomitantly with 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 74/143   
 
  
 
 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, 
telaprevir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, ritonavir, grapefruit or grapefruit juice) as an increase in glasdegib 
plasma concentration may occur. If possible, alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 inhibition potential is recommended. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided, as this is likely to 
decrease glasdegib plasma concentrations. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be 
avoided, the dose of Daurismo should be increased (see SmPC section 4.2). In addition to in vivo 
investigations, the potential for glasdegib to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes was investigated in vitro (see 
SmPC section 5.2).                 
The PI wording specifies that glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit P-gp (GI tract) and BCRP 
(systemically and at the GI tract) mediated-transport at clinically relevant concentrations, and caution should 
be exercised in administration of narrow therapeutic index substrates of P-gp and BCRP in combination with 
glasdegib (see SmPC section 4.5). Clinically relevant DDIs are not expected following coadministration of 
glasdegib with MATE1 or MATE2K substrates (see SmPC section 4.5).   
In two studies (B1371014 & B1371026) the effect of a PPI on glasdegib PK was investigated. Although 
glasdegib Cmax decrease 20% in combination with a PPI, there was no change in glasdegib AUCinf. 
Concomitant administration of glasdegib with acid-reducing agents (including PPIs, H2-receptor antagonists, 
and locally acting antacids) is permitted (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Pharmacodynamics  
Glasdegib is a protein-kinase inhibitor targeting SMO in the hedgehog signalling pathway. The theoretic 
pharamacodynamic principles have been sufficiently described by the Applicant. The choice of GLI-1 as PD 
marker is endorsed as it is an important downstream target in the Hh signalling pathway and a commonly 
used marker in the investigation of Hh inhibitors. Since the primary pharmacology, assessment of the 
inhibitor effect of glasdegib on expression of the GLI1 gene (transcriptional regulator of the Hh pathway), 
was assessed on a small size of patient samples from various studies, these data can only be considered as a 
proof of concept. The number of patients evaluated in the studies was very limited (n= 25), with only 3 
patients in study B1371001 and 12 patients in study B1371002. In study B1371005, biomarker analysis were 
performed; the downregulation of GLI1 expression was not observed at the 25-mg dose level, it was 
observed at 50 mg and above. This observation suggests that at the clinically recommended dose of 100 mg, 
glasdegib reduces GLI1 expression relative to baseline levels. Additional preliminary exploratory analyses 
showed no pharmacodynamic modulation of the expression of other pathway-relevant genes. Preliminary 
data from a mutational analysis suggest that glasdegib could induce a therapeutic response in various 
mutated AML and MDS. However, no clear conclusion could be drawn without mutational dedicated studies.  
Although the data are sparse, treatment with glasdegib reduced GLI-1 expression over 80%, supporting the 
proposed mode of action. Choice of the proposed 100mg QD dose seems rational, regarding downregulation 
of GLI-1 expression over 90% with the proposed dose. However, no dedicated study assessing relationship 
between plasma concentration and effect has been done. Treatment-Response (T-R) and Exposure-Response 
(E-R) analysis have been done on data from the patients randomized in the non-intensive chemotherapy arm 
in the part 2 of the B1371003 study where the dose of glasdegib of 100 mg was assessed. Finally, the MTD 
was defined as 400 mg QD after considering the DLT and QTc prolongation data observed in the FIH study - 
Study B1371001. The RP2D of glasdegib of 200 mg QD (or less) has been selected based on preliminary 
efficacy results from the FIH study taking into account an additional safety margin.

Exposure-response relationships with safety endpoints identified some adverse effects: dysgeusia, muscle 
spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolonged. It is mentioned in the section 4.9 of the SmPC that 
“Glasdegib has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 640 mg/day. At the highest dosage the 
dose-limiting toxicities reported were nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, fatigue and dizziness”.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the data presented enable conclusive description of the pharmacokinetic profile of oral glasdegib 
in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The information on pharmacokinetics is considered adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
The mechanism of action of glasdegib in the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy, 
seems plausible. Taken together, the presented data to characterise pharmacodynamic profile of glasdegib in 
AML patients support the postulated mechanism of action and inform the dose finding.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of glasdegib + LDAC is supported by the pivotal, randomised portion of Study B1371003 (see Table 
21). The assessment focuses on the claimed indication: “in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) 
chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 
adult patients who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy”.  
Study B1371003 is a multi-centre, open-label Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
glasdegib when administered in combination with first-line treatment regimens for AML and high-risk MDS. 
This study was divided into a Phase 1b portion and a Phase 2 portion. A schematic of this study is provided in 
Figure 12.  
Only data of patients treated by glasdegib and LDAC have been assessed in this application: data from the 
arm A of the phase 1b are presented in the section on dose-response, and data from the ‘pivotal arm’ 
including unfit (non-intensive population) in the phase 2 are discussed in the section on main study results  
below. 
In the Phase 1b portion, patients participated in a dose-escalation phase aimed at estimating the maximum 
tolerated dose of glasdegib in combination with 1 of 3 different chemotherapy options (Arms A [LDAC], B 
[decitabine], and C [7+3 intensive chemotherapy regimen]).  
The Phase 2 portion consisted of 2 parts. In the first Phase 2 part, patients who were not candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy (unfit population, “P2 Unfit”) were randomised to receive either glasdegib 
+ LDAC or LDAC alone. Randomization of this non-intensive population used a 2:1 allocation ratio and was 
stratified by prognostic risk factor (good/intermediate or poor) based on cytogenetics. In the second Phase 2 
part, patients who were candidates for intensive chemotherapy (intensive/fit population) received glasdegib 
in combination with 7+3 chemotherapy.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response study has been submitted in this application. In the Phase 1b portion of study 
B1371003, patients participated in a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the maximum tolerated dose 
of glasdegib in combination with LDAC in Arm A. Clinical efficacy of glasdegib + LDAC in adults with 
previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS was assessed as secondary endpoint.  
Phase 1b: methodology 
Primary Objective: To determine the MTD and RP2D of glasdegib in combination with LDAC (Arm A), 
decitabine (Arm B) or cytarabine/daunorubicin (Arm C) when administered to adults with previously 
untreated AML or high-risk MDS – primary endpoint: DLT. 
Secondary Objectives: In arm A, to assess the efficacy of glasdegib when administered in combination with 
LDAC to adults with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS – endpoints: CR/Cri.  
Design of part 1b 
For each arm separately, a 3+3 dose escalation design was applied in 3-6 patient cohorts until identification 
of the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD) of glasdegib when given in combination with each 
standard therapy. MTD was determined separately within each arm and was associated with the occurrence 
of DLTs in <33% of patients. In practice, the MTD estimate was the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 evaluable 
patients experienced a DLT during the DLT observation period with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 
3 to 6 patients experiencing DLTs. 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 77/143   
 
  
 
 
 
In arm A, LDAC was administered twice daily subcutaneously for the first 10 days of each 28-day cycle. In 
each safety dose escalation cohort, glasdegib administration began on Cycle 1/Day 3 for PK assessment 
purposes and continued with no interruptions thereafter. In the Phase 1b portion of the study, glasdegib was 
initially administered at a starting dose of 100 mg once daily. Starting doses for subsequent patient cohorts 
were to be 50 or 200 mg once daily, based on DLT.  
For the Phase 1b portion, an external Data Monitoring Committee was not established. During this portion, 
the sponsor procedures for periodic safety review were applied by an internal safety review team with 
medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and summary data collected in the safety and clinical 
databases.  
Phase 1b: results 
Disposition of patients: 23 patients were assessed in the full analysis set; 17 received 100 mg of glasdegib + 
LDAC and 6 received 200 mg of glasdegib + LDAC. 
Baseline data: The mean (range) age for Arm A was 75.8 (60 to 85) years. The majority of patients had 
good/intermediate cytogenetic risk, specifically 14 (60.9%) patients in Arm A. Most patients (50/52) received 
drugs prior to study treatments. In Arm A specifically, 12/23 (52.2%) patients received prior 
hypomethylating agents (HMA: decitabine or azacitidine). 
Dose limiting toxicity: A total of 28 patients were enrolled in the 3 arms. Out of these 28 patients, there were 
26 patients evaluable for DLTs; Patient 10031003 died from disease progression before receiving at least 
80% planned dose and Patient 10211014 refused to continue study treatments for reason other than AE. 
Therefore, the 2 patients were not evaluable for DLTs. 1 patient was reported to have a DLT in the Arm C 
(Grade 4 polyneuropathy reported during the first induction cycle). The MTD was not reached for Arm A, B or 
C. A MTD of 400 mg was confirmed in the B1371001 FIH study. 
Analysis of efficacy: 2 out of 23 patients (8.7% [80% CI: 2.3%, 21.5%]) patients in Arm A achieved CR/CRi 
based on investigator-reported responses. 21 deaths were reported, and the estimated median OS was 4.4 
[80% CI: 2.5, 6.6] months. Limited efficacy of glasdegib has been shown in these preliminary results.

Treatments 
Both agents (glasdegib, LDAC) were to be started together on Cycle 1/Day 1. 
Glasdegib 100 mg once a day has been administered in the morning at approximately the same time as the 
first LDAC subcutaneous injection on days these agents are dosed together. LDAC has been administered at a 
dose of 20 mg (not adjusted for the patients’ weight) SC twice daily (morning and evening; approximately 12 
hrs apart) on Days 1-10 days of the 28 day cycles. 
Treatment with glasdegib in combination with LDAC could continue for up to 1 year (12 cycles) from start of 
therapy or until disease progression or relapse, patient refusal, or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity 
(whichever came first). Patients who completed treatment for 1 year (12 cycles) with LDAC were considered 
to have completed treatment on the trial. Patients who completed the maximum number of cycles/months on 
study treatment, demonstrated clinical benefit with manageable toxicity, and who were willing to continue 
receiving assigned treatment could be given the opportunity to do so upon agreement between investigator, 
sponsor and pending study drug availability. For patients on trial longer than the specified period, the 
schedule of activities continued to be followed. 
After discontinuation of study treatment (all arms), post-treatment survival status was to be collected every 
month for the first 2 months and thereafter every 2 months until death or until termination of the study by 
the sponsor. All patients would be followed for 4 years from the first dose. Patients who were randomized but 
did not start treatment would be followed for survival on this schedule from the date of randomization. 
The study was to be considered complete once all patients have been followed for 4 years from first dose (or 
randomization date if applicable), which means the last enrolled patient has been followed for 4 years from 
his/her first dose (or randomization if applicable).

Response assessment  
Assessment of response was made using response criteria for MDS and AML derived and defined by the 
disease specific International Working Groups and WHO Guidelines3,4.  
Investigator responses are the Investigator's assessment of morphologic disease response per patient based 
on locally analysed bone marrow aspirates or biopsies, blood samples, and other clinical assessments. Based 
on clinical judgment, the investigator entered a disease response for each patient in the CRF according to the 
criteria cited above. 
Derived responses are the Sponsor's assessment of morphologic disease responses determined 
programmatically. Algorithms based on AML and MDS response criteria used the same patient data in the 
CRF recorded by the investigator to derive each patient’s response.

Sample size 
The null hypothesis was that the OS HR = 1, and the treatment effect was hypothesised to result in HR = 
0.625 (considering a historic median OS for LDAC of 5 months and the expected median OS for glasdegib + 
LDAC of 8 months). The significance level was set to one-sided alpha 10%. Accordingly, a total of 92 OS 
events were to be observed for the final analysis to provide 80% power to detect the mentioned treatment 
difference.  
Randomisation 
In the unfit arm of the portion 2 of the study, the randomization used a 2:1 allocation ratio 
(glasdegib+LDAC : LDAC alone) and was stratified by cytogenetic risk factor (good/intermediate, or poor).  
Randomisation was stratified in the IVRS based on prognosis (cytogenetic risk factor of good/intermediate or 
poor risk). Any one of the following cytogenetic features (which were required prior to enrolment) classified 
the patient as having poor-risk disease: inv(3), t(6;9), 11q23, -5, -5q, -7, abnl (17p), complex karyotype 
(≥3 clonal abnormalities). Patients with none of these features were classified as having good/intermediate-
risk disease. The patient risk was captured in IVRS, and the factor(s) characterizing the patient risk were 
captured on the case report forms (CRFs) (Table 26).  
Table 26: Cytogenetic risk classification in study B1371003.
Blinding (masking) 
The overall study was an open-label study (not blinded).  
Statistical methods 
The hypothesis of the randomized cohort of the phase II part of this study was that patients with previously 
untreated AML and MDS and scheduled for non-intensive chemotherapy (unfit population) would have an 
improved OS when glasdegib was used in combination with LDAC.  
The study investigated the difference in survival between glasdegib + LDAC and LDAC alone in a clinical 
scenario that includes all patients regardless of their treatment compliance (similar to treatment policy 
estimand). Patients who were lost to follow-up were assumed to be comparable in terms of survival to those 
who remained in the study.  
The primary endpoint was OS, defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. A Cox model 
using the stratification factor prognosis (good/intermediate vs poor) and treatment as covariates was 
implemented to calculate the hazard ratio (HR).  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 82/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
At the final analysis (planned at a total of 92 OS events observed), an observed HR of 0.76 or below (i.e., 
observed nominal one-sided α≤0.1) will reject the null hypothesis of HR = 1. 
The proportion of patients who achieved CR with 80 % CI (normal approximation) for each arm was also 
calculated. A Pearson χ2 test (unstratified) and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by prognosis 
were presented. 
The full analysis set included all randomized patients of the P2 Unfit arms. No Per Protocol Analysis Set has 
been defined in part 2 of the study.  
Patients’ treatment arm assignment in the Phase 2 portion was based on the fit or unfit status at screening 
and an Interactive Registration System (IRS) has been used. Patients in the Phase 2 Unfit randomized 
component have been analysed in the arm they were randomized for the efficacy analyses, and in the arm 
they were treated for the safety analyses.  
For primary and secondary efficacy analyses, no values were to be imputed for missing data. Patients not 
known to have died at the time of the last follow-up were censored on the date they were last known to be 
alive. In the assessment of CR/CRi rate in phase 1b and CR rate in phase 2 portion of the study, patients who 
were not known to have achieved the endpoint of interest (CR/CRi or CR) were counted as non-responders. 
One futility interim analysis (IA) was planned when 46 OS events have been observed. The futility boundary 
was calculated accordingly using an alpha spending function. 
The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints was based on Derived response, and the secondary analysis on 
the investigator data. The interim analysis was based on investigator’s assessments. 
The SAP was version 5, dated 11 March 2016. The SAP was amended several times while the study was 
ongoing to reflect the changes made in the protocol. The changes made in the SAP include updating the 
study design to a phase 1b/2 study, clarification of definitions and removal of some exploratory endpoints.  
Results 
Participant flow 
The patient disposition for the P2 Unfit arms is summarized in Table 27. All 132 randomized patients (88 and 
44 patients in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively) were included in the efficacy 
analyses. 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 83/143   
 
  
 
 
Table 27. Patient disposition Phase 2 Unfit (non-intensive). 
In the P2 Unfit population, 2.3-fold more patients discontinued the treatment because of death in arm LDAC 
alone compared to the arm glasdegib + LDAC was observed. However, a higher proportion of patients in the 
combination arm (44.0% vs 36.6%) discontinued treatment because of an insufficient clinical response.  
The number of patients in the MDS arm is very small. No assessment could be done based on MDS efficacy 
data.  
Recruitment 
Study B1371003 was conducted from 2012 to 2019 at 81 study sites in Europe (Germany, Italy, Poland, 
Spain) and North America.  
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the protocol 
The original protocol (version date: 28 October 2011) was amended 5 times. The submission is based on the 
protocol with Amendment 5 (version date: 08 February 2016). Inter alia, the independent assessment of 
bone marrow samples had been removed, and no bone marrow samples in the study were analysed by 
independent review.  
Protocol deviations  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 84/143   
 
  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported important protocol deviations were SAE not reported within 24 hours of 
awareness (26 [19.7%] patients) and randomization related: patient not stratified correctly at randomization 
in IVRS (21 [15.9%] patients), and patient randomization in error (6 [4.5%] patients). Any of the other 
important protocol deviations was reported in ≤3 patients.  
Baseline data 
The demographic and other baseline characteristics for patients in the P2 Unfit arms are summarized in Table 
28. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms for median age and 
baseline cytogenetic risk. Of note, a higher proportion of male patients were randomized to the glasdegib 
100 mg + LDAC arm versus LDAC alone arm. 
All patients had ECOG score of 0-2 (except for 1 untreated patient in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm 
without reported record) and the score distribution was generally similar between the glasdegib 100 mg + 
LDAC and LDAC alone arms. 
Fifty-two (52 [59.1%]) and 25 (56.8%) patients had good/intermediate cytogenetic risk (IVRS based) in the 
glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively.

Table 29. Disease Baseline Characteristics (Full Analysis Set) – Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive).
A higher proportion of patients with an adverse prognostic risk factor for AML has been observed at the 
baseline in LDAC alone arm compared to glasdegib + LDAC arm (42.1% vs 32.1%). The Applicant submitted 
a subgroup analysis for AML patients with adverse prognostic risk factor, showing OS result (HR=0.51 [95% 
CI: 0.26, 1.00]) consistent with the primary analysis of OS.

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Overall survival 
The OS for patients in the Phase 2 Unfit arms is summarized in Table 33 below (IVRS based cytogenetic risk; 
primary analysis). CRF based cytogenetic risk per ELN criteria data have been submitted as secondary 
analyses.  
Table 34. Summary of overall survival for all patients in the study B1371003 Phase 2 Non-
Intensive Population - IVRS based cytogenetic risk.
The difference in OS (primary endpoint) for AML + MDS population was statistically significant (8.8 [6.9-9.9] 
versus 4.9 [3.5-6.0] months; HR = 0.513) and the 80% CIs did not overlap.

Figure 14. Kaplan-Meier Plot of overall survival in patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic 
risk. 
Among the overall population (AML + MDS), the subgroup of patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk 
in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm had statistically significant improvement in OS as compared to the 
subgroup of those with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the LDAC alone arm (HR = 0.427 [based on 
IVRS]; p = 0.0008; Table 41). This result is supported by the secondary analysis based on CRF (HR = 0.439; 
p = 0.0008; Table 41). A significant OS improvement was confirmed in AML patients (HR = 0.417 [based on 
IVRS]; p = 0.0011; Table 41).

Stratification in the Study B1371003 Phase 2 Non-Intensive Population.
Figure 15. Kaplan-Meier Plot of overall survival in patients with poor cytogenetic risk. 
For AML + MDS patients with poor cytogenetic risk, there was no statistically difference in OS with 80% CI at 
the 5% significance level between the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm and the LDAC alone arm (based on 
IVRS: HR = 0.633 [0.430-0.934], p = 0.0640; based on CRF: HR = 0.613 [0.40-0.916], p = 0.0570). 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 92/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, improvement of overall survival has been observed in combination arm [4.4 months (95% CI 3.4, 
9.1) vs. 3.1 months (95% CI 1.1. 6.4)]. 
•  Secondary endpoint: Complete Remission 
Proportions of patients with derived and investigator-reported CR in the P2 Unfit arms by IVRS based 
cytogenetic risk are summarized Table 37. 
Table 37. Summary of Proportions of Patients with Derived and Investigator-Reported CR (Full 
Analysis Set) - Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive). 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 93/143   
 
  
 
 
 
In the overall population, higher significant complete remission rates have been observed in the combination 
arm: 17% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.01. This result is confirmed in AML patients: 17.9% vs. 2.6%; p = 0.02.  
A numerically higher CR rate was also observed in the combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm for 
patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk (20.4% vs. 0) and for patients with poor cytogenetic risk 
patients (13.8% vs. 5.9%). 
•  Other secondary endpoints 
Respectively 22 (25.0% [80% CI: 19.1%, 30.9%]) and 2 (4.5% [80% CI: 0.5%, 8.6%]) patients achieved 
CR/CRi in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and LDAC alone arms based on derived responses.

Assessment report  
Page 94/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 38. Derived best overall response for patients with AML (Full Analysis Set) - Phase 2 Unfit 
For the AML population, significant improvement of morphologic CR rate was observed (17.9 vs. 2.6%).  
For the other secondary endpoints, 80% CI intervals overlapped. However, the descriptive analyses showed 
higher rates of morphologic CRi (6.4 vs. 2.6%), MLFS (2.6 vs. 0%), PR (6.4 vs. 2.6%), PRi (1.3 vs. 0) in 
combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm, which could explain lesser rates of MR (6.4 vs. 10.5%) and 
SD (15.4 vs. 21.1%) in the combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm.  
Of note, 8/78 patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and none in LDAC alone arm had cytogenetic response 
CR, while 12/78 patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 1/38 in LDAC alone arm had molecular CR. 
Ancillary analyses 
For the pivotal Phase 2 non-intensive population in Study B1371003, the primary endpoint of OS was further 
evaluated by demographic factors defined in Table 38.

Deaths were due primarily to the disease under study in both age groups: In ≥75 year old population, 
35 [66.0%] in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 18 [75.0%] in the LDAC-only arm; and the <75 year old 
population: 21 [60.0%] in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 17 [85.0%] in the LDAC-only arm).

Analysis of OS in the Phase 2 Non-Intensive population by sex 
Table 42. Summary of overall survival for all patients in Study B1371003 Phase 2 Non-Intensive 
AML + MDS population by sex.
Deaths were due primarily to the disease under study in both males and females. In males, 45 (65.2%) 
deaths in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 22 (84.6%) in the LDAC-only arm were due to disease under study, 
and in females, 11 (57.9%) deaths in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 13 (72.2%) in the LDAC-only arm were 
due to disease under study.  
For female patients, the HR was 0.56, not significant (p = 0.065).  
Analysis of OS in the Phase 2 Non-Intensive population by race

Deaths were due primarily to the disease under study in both subgroups. In the de novo history subgroup, 25 
(65.8%) deaths in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 12 (66.7%) in the LDAC-only arm were due to disease 
under study, and in the secondary history subgroup, 24 (60.0%) deaths in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 17 
(85.0%) in the LDAC-only arm were due to disease under study. 
In the glasdegib + LDAC arm, the median OS (mOS) of 9.1 (95% CI: 4.4, 16.5) months for AML patients 
with secondary disease (n = 40) appeared to be better than the mOS of 6.6 (95% CI: 3.7, 12.4) months for 
AML patients with de novo (n = 38); however, given the nature of subgroup analysis with limited sample 
sizes and the overlapping 95% CIs, these two subgroups were considered comparable.

Study B1371001 was an FIH, open-label, multi-centre, Phase 1 study of glasdegib administered PO once daily 
as a single agent to men and women ≥18 years old with selected haematologic malignancies. Patients were 
eligible if their disease was refractory, resistant, or intolerant to prior therapies, or they were newly 
diagnosed and previously untreated but not eligible for standard treatment options, or for whom standard 
therapies were not anticipated to result in a durable response. The primary objectives were to determine 
glasdegib MTD and RP2D. Efficacy was assessed as a secondary measure.  
Forty-seven (47) patients, aged 25-89 years old (mean 64.1 years) with AML (28), CML (5), CMML (1), MDS 
(6), or MF (7) were treated with glasdegib (5-600 mg once daily). Eleven (11) patients discontinued the 
study due to death. All treated patients were assessed for PK and safety; 46 patients were assessed for 
efficacy. 
Early signs of efficacy with glasdegib were seen across a range of acute and chronic haematologic 
malignancies. A total of 3/6 MDS patients and 1/1 CMML patient achieved SD or better, among whom 2 
showed hematologic improvement. Two (2) of the 7 MF patients achieved clinical improvement. Among the 2 
patients with CML-accelerated phase/blast crisis, 1 had a partial cytogenetic response. None of the patients 
with CML-chronic phase had a cytogenetic response. Among the 28 AML patients, 1 patient had CRi, 4 
patients had PR with incomplete blood count recovery (PRi), and 4 patients had minor response. 
Treatment failures occurred in 7 patients due to resistant disease. Clinical benefit [CR + morphologic CRi + 
PR + PRi + SD + minor response] was shown in 16 patients, including 7 with SD. 
Study B1371001 was an FIH study, efficacy assessment was secondary objective. 3/6 MDS patients achieved 
SD or better. Among the 28 AML patients, 1 patient had CRi, 4 patients had PR with incomplete blood count 
recovery (PRi), and 4 patients had minor response. 
•  Study B1371005 
Study B1371005 is an ongoing open-label, multi-centre, Phase 1 study in Japan in patients with selected 
hematologic malignancies to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, and potential DDI of glasdegib in 
combination with LDAC (non-intensive) or 7+3 (intensive) (AML + MDS in combination arms). The study also

had a monotherapy arm (AML, MDS, CML, CMML, MF). Data are available as of a 20 February 2017 data cut-
off date. 
Patients in the monotherapy treatment arm received glasdegib once daily (25 mg, 3 patients; 50 mg, 4 
patients; 100 mg, 6 patients) for 7 to 167 days. Among the 7 patients with AML, 1 achieved CR, and 4 
achieved stable disease (SD). Among the 4 patients with MDS, 1 achieved mCR, and 2 achieved SD. Efficacy 
data are not available for the non-AML/non-MDS patients. 
4 AML patients and 2 MDS patients in the non-intensive treatment arm received glasdegib 100 mg once daily 
plus LDAC for 29 to 168 days (1 patient was still receiving the treatment as of the data cutoff date). Among 
the 4 patients with AML, 1 achieved CR, and 1 achieved SD. Among the 2 patients with MDS, both achieved 
SD. 
6 AML patients in the intensive treatment arm received glasdegib 100 mg once daily plus 7+3 for 22 to 342 
days (1 patient was still receiving treatment as of the cutoff date). Five (5) of the 6 patients achieved 
CR/CRi. 
Preliminary data from the monotherapy cohort indicate that the PK profile of glasdegib is similar between 
Japanese patients (Study B1371005) and non-Japanese patients (Study B1371001). 
Study B1371005 is not an efficacy dedicated study. Responses to glasdegib with LDAC in AML and MDS 
patients have been observed in these preliminary efficacy results. No study report has been submitted. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal Study B1371003 is a multi-centre, open-label Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of glasdegib when administered in combination with first-line treatment regimens for AML and high-
risk MDS. This study was divided into a Phase 1b portion (a dose escalation phase) and a Phase 2 consisted 
of 2 parts (assessment in unfit and fit population). Only the unfit Phase 2 part was assessed in the efficacy 
section as reflecting the claimed population: in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) chemotherapy 
for the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients 
who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy. 
Designs of both parts of the study are considered acceptable: 
• 
• 
a 3+3 dose escalation design was used in the Part1b to characterize the MTD and RP2D of this 
oncology drug. The starting dose of 100 mg glasdegib was recommended in the Phase 1 study 
(B1371001) which is acceptable. LDAC has been used with the recommended doses (NCCN 2019); 
patients in the unfit part 2 of the study were randomised to receive either glasdegib + LDAC or LDAC 
alone. Randomization used a 2:1 allocation ratio and was stratified by prognostic risk factor 
(good/intermediate or poor) based on cytogenetics.  
After the determination of RP2D of glasdegib (100 mg) in the part 1b, the efficacy of glasdegib in 
combination with LDAC in unfit patient was thus assessed in a randomized, open-label cohort of LDAC ± 
glasdegib. The hypothesis was that patients with previously untreated AML and MDS and scheduled for non-
intensive chemotherapy (unfit population) would have an improved OS when glasdegib was used in 
combination with LDAC.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 102/143   
 
  
 
 
The comparator LDAC alone is acceptable as known as standard of care in international recommendation 
(ESMO, NCCN 2019). The recommended dose modifications to manage haematologic and non-haematologic 
adverse reactions in the SmPC section 4.2 are aligned with the dose modifications that were followed in the 
B1371003 trial, which is acceptable. 
In this report, assessment mainly focuses on efficacy data of AML patients.  
Taking into account the date of protocol writing (1st version 28/10/2011), diagnostic criteria for AML 
according to the WHO 2008 classification were used in this study. The differences with the latest classification 
(WHO 2016) should not impact glasdegib efficacy assessment. The criteria relative to the unfit status are 
acceptable. Finally, the inclusion criteria reflect the claimed population: previously untreated acute myeloid 
leukaemia. 
The efficacy endpoints, overall survival (primary endpoint) and the complete remission (secondary endpoint) 
were used according to international recommendations (ELN 2017 criteria; IWG 2006). The further secondary 
AML response endpoints [CR, CRi, Morphologic Leukemia-Free State, Partial Remission (PR), Partial 
Remission with incomplete blood count recovery (PRi), Minor Response (MR), Stable Disease (SD), 
Cytogenetic Complete Response (CRc), and Molecular Complete Response (CRm)] were defined according to 
IWG 2003 criteria. This is acceptable since the criteria defining these are similar to the ELN 2017 criteria. 
A protocol amendment resulting in the removal of independent assessment of bone marrow samples and the 
fact that no bone marrow samples in the study were analysed by independent review, was a concern during 
the assessment, because independent assessment had been planned as a quality measure for the correct 
ascertainment of the diagnosis and assessments of bone marrow samples. The concordance of AML 
diagnostics performed at an institution and by an independent committee is expected to be high, because the 
diagnosis does not depend on morphological interpretation (and thus to a degree of subjectivity), but in 
particular on the demonstration of cytogenetic and mutational anomalies and clonal demonstration by flow 
cytometry. Even though the Applicant did not justify why this procedure was changed, this issue was not 
further pursued because it is anticipated that diagnostic work-up at pathology units at specialized 
departments participating in a clinical trial in AML is performed at a satisfactory level of competence.  
During the assessment, a major concern was that the proportion of patients non-evaluable for response was 
30.8% in the glasdegib + LDAC treatment group and 42.1% in the LDAC group. The Applicant provided a 
satisfactory explanation and justified that this major concern is applicable to a secondary efficacy endpoint. 
In the context, the Applicant provided results for AML patients, separately, which reduces the number of 
patients in both arms for the analysis equally, while numbers of patients are still assessable. The basic 
principles determining the results by ITT and inclusion of patients as non-responder are acceptable, in 
particular because the Applicant has clarified the circumstances for response evaluation to reflect common 
practice. Patients with progressive disease or deteriorating due to complications are not exposed to invasive 
procedures, with the burden, discomfort and risk for adverse events, like a bone marrow examination without 
a therapeutic consequence. This decision made by the treating physician together with the individual patient 
has been guided also by results of peripheral blood analysis (neutrophils, blast-counts, thrombocytopenia, 
perhaps including microscopy of a smear and flow-cytometry analysis) and the physical signs of remission 
(no fever, weight gain, Karnofsky performance status etc.). In most cases this integrated sum of information 
is sufficient to document the response status and to substantiate the therapeutic decisions – if not, a bone 
marrow examination will be suggested, provided it has a consequence. The relatively high proportion of 
patients in both arms being non-evaluable is not considered to pose a safety risk for the AML patients in 
these circumstances, the reasons and extent are acceptable when put in perspective of the management of 
AML in a palliative setting. The difference of 4 months in the primary endpoint, OS, in patients treated with 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 103/143   
 
  
 
 
LDAC + glasdegib (8.3 months) compared to LDAC monotherapy (4.3 months), supported by higher response 
rates (17.9% versus 2.6%), are clinically meaningful results when assessed as a single study. The results 
emphasize the unmet medical need in first-line treatment across the biological spectre of de novo and 
secondary AML in patients, who cannot be administered intensive chemotherapy. 
The criteria for inclusion reflect a population of patients who are not candidates for standard induction 
chemotherapy. However, the age criteria (above 55 or 75 years at enrolment) seems to be arbitrary. The 
Applicant clarified that age 55 years on the low end and age ≥75 years were included in the Study B1371003 
protocol as guidance. It is agreed that age should not be the sole criterion for treating AML with an intensive 
or non-intensive chemotherapy regimen. Biologically, AML does differ between younger and older adults, due 
to different driving cytogenetic and mutational aberrations, but these are often more unfavourable in the 
elderly patients, and the Hedgehog pathway targeting treatment should expectedly be effective also in adults 
below 50 years of age. Also according to more recent ELN recommendations, age should not be the sole 
determinant of treatment decisions (Döhner et al. Blood 2017). The criterion of being older than 75 years in 
particular may cause a bias in relation to the age-independent claimed indication.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All 132 randomized patients (88 and 44 patients in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms, 
respectively) were included in the efficacy analyses. Among these patients, 116 patients suffered of AML (78 
in glasdegib + LDAC arm and 38 in LDAC alone arm) and 16 patients suffered of MDS patients (10 in 
glasdegib + LDAC arm and 6 in LDAC alone arm). The number of patients in the MDS arm is very small. No 
assessment could be done based on MDS efficacy data.  
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics are similar in both arms. A higher proportion of 
patients with an adverse prognostic risk factors for AML has been observed at the baseline in LDAC alone arm 
compared to glasdegib + LDAC arm (42.1% vs. 32.1%). A higher proportion of patients in glasdegib + LDAC 
arm compared to LDAC alone arm with a serum creatinine > 1.3 mg/dl, with a severe cardiac disease and 
with 2 or more of the unfit criteria in the AML arm has been observed.  
The data were considered as mature, with 109 of 132 (82.6%) of AML + MDS patients having died by the 
efficacy data cut-off date, with a median follow-up time >20 months for each treatment arm.  
The difference in OS in AML+MDS population was statistically significant (8.8 versus 4.9 months; HR = 
0.513) and the 80% CI did not overlap ([6.9, 9.9]; [3.5, 6.0]). As planned in the protocol, if an observed HR 
under 0.76 is observed, the null hypothesis is rejected. Results were similar with the secondary analyses 
using the stratified Cox proportional hazards model based on patient risk factors as per the CRF. Thus, the 
results were not impacted by the randomization by IVRS using fewer patient details than documented in the 
CRF.  
The effect of glasdegib on OS in the Phase 2 non-intensive AML + MDS population appeared to be 
comparable between patients older and younger than 75 years of age. However, reliable conclusions could 
not be drawn from this OS analysis between patients older and younger than 65 years of age due to the very 
small numbers of patients <65 years old enrolled in this study. The effect of glasdegib on OS in the Phase 2 
non-intensive AML + MDS population appeared to be comparable between male and female patients. Reliable 
conclusions could not be drawn from the OS analysis by race due to the very small numbers of Black and 
Asian patients enrolled in this study. Due to the small sample size of patients in North America (8 patients in 
the LDAC alone arm), no conclusion could be drawn on OS per geographic region.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 104/143   
 
  
 
 
The significant improvement of OS has been confirmed in patients with AML (8.3 versus 4.3 months; HR = 
0.46; 80% CI [6.6, 9.5]; [2.9, 4.9]; p = 0.0002).  
Patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm had statistically 
significant improvement in OS as compared to those with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the LDAC 
alone arm (12.2 [8.3, 14.4] versus 4.8 [4.1, 6.0] months; HR = 0.43 [based on IVRS]; p value=0.0008). 
This result is supported by the secondary analysis based on CRF (HR = 0.44). Significant OS improvement is 
confirmed in AML patients (11.1 [7.7, 14.5] versus 4.4 [1.9, 5.3] months; HR = 0.42 [based on IVRS]; 
p = 0.001).  
For patients with poor cytogenetic risk, there was no difference statistically with 80% IC at the 5% 
significance level between the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm and the LDAC alone arm in OS (based on IVRS: 
HR = 0.63 [0.43-0.93], p = 0.06; based on CRF: HR = 0.61 [0.410-0.916], p = 0.06).  
Ancillary analyses were also performed on the primary endpoint. In the glasdegib + LDAC arm, the median 
OS (mOS) of 9.1 (95% CI: 4.4, 16.5) months for AML patients with secondary disease (n = 40) appeared to 
be better than the mOS of 6.6 (95% CI: 3.7, 12.4) months for AML patients with de novo (n = 38); however, 
given the nature of subgroup analysis with limited sample sizes and the overlapped 95% CIs between these 
two groups, they were considered comparable. 
Rates of both derived and investigator-reported complete remission are similar which is reassuring. In the 
overall population, higher significant complete remission rates have been observed in the combination arm: 
17% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.014. Higher significant CR in combination arm is confirmed in AML patients: 17.9% vs. 
2.6%; p = 0.02. Higher numerically CR rate was also observed in combination arm compared to LDAC alone 
arm for patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk (20.4% vs. 0) and for patients with poor cytogenetic 
risk patients (13.8% vs. 5.9%).  
For the other secondary endpoints in AML population, significant improvement of morphologic CR rate was 
observed (17.9 vs. 2.6%). For the other treatment-response rates, 80% CI intervals overlapped. However, 
these descriptive data showed higher rates of morphologic Cri (6.4 vs. 2.6%), MLFS (2.6 vs. 0%), PR (6.4 vs. 
2.6%), PRi (1.3 vs. 0%) in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm which could explain lesser rates of 
MR (6.4 vs. 10.5%) and SD (15.4 vs. 21.1%) in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm.  
The benefit in the combination of glasdegib + LDAC in AML across ages, the ITT and the randomized patients 
is accepted.  
Data of quality of life would be interesting but was not submitted. Only one patient went to transplant after 
glasdegib treatment and was not anticipated to significantly impact the overall survival in this study. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of glasdegib in combination with LDAC is shown by the results of the open-label, randomized 
Study B1371003 in newly-diagnosed, elderly AML patients who are not candidates for standard induction 
chemotherapy, in terms of improvement of OS and increase of the potential to achieve CR.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data come primarily from both treatment arms in the randomized Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003 
(Safety Analysis Set, S1 Cohort). The S1 Cohort as well as the S2A and S4 Pools included patients receiving 
the recommended 100 mg glasdegib starting dose (N=186).  
Table 46. Patient cohorts and pools used for safety data analyses.
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 106/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
According to Table 45, 101 patients AML + MDS were treated by the combination glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC 
(84 in the part 2 and 17 in the part 1b). Among these 101 patients, 89 were AML patients (75 treated in part 
2 and 14 in part 1b) and 12 were MDS patients (9 treated in part 2 and 3 in part 1b).  
The safety profile assessment of glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC in this report focuses on the randomized Phase 2 
portion of Study B1371003 (S1 cohort). The S2A pool (including AML patients in part 1b and part 2 unfit), S4 
pool have been considered as supportive safety data. Also, the safety profile of glasdegib in monotherapy has 
been evaluated in 3 monotherapy sponsored-studies (B1371001, B1371002 and B1371013) and 3 
investigator-initiated studies (WI171861, WI220403, WI204578). 
In the phase 2 unfit arm of the B1371003 pivotal study (S1 Cohort), the safety analysis set was defined as all 
enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of any of the study medications. 
Table 47: Treatment duration and dose exposure summary for all cycles (Safety Analysis Set, S1 
Cohort) - Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive).
The median treatment duration was 1.8-fold longer in the glasdegib + LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm 
(83.0 vs. 47.0 days). The median treatment exposure time of glasdegib was 75.5 days with a large range of 
exposure time from 3 to 954 days.

Page 107/143   
 
  
 
 
 
Concerning the LDAC treatment, the mean dose per cycle and mean relative dose intensities are similar in 
both arms (glasdegib + LDAC arm and LDAC alone arm). No dose interruption of LDAC has been observed in 
either arm.  
Dose reductions have been done in 13 (15.5%) patients, and 3 (3.6%) temporary dose delays have been 
reported in the combination arm.

•  Musculoskeletal  events 
Muscle spasms are a known class effect of SMO inhibitors and have been reported with glasdegib and other 
SMO inhibitors. In the glasdegib program, the majority of AEs within the MUSCLE SPASMS ADR were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity but were reported as TRAEs in 20.2% of patients in combination arm and none in LDAC alone 
arm. 
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with other SMO inhibitors. Neither AEs in the RHABDOMYOLYSIS cluster 
nor events of Rhabdomyolysis have been reported as of the safety data cutoff dates. Outside of the 
RHABDOMYOLYSIS cluster, there were no AEs of Blood creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) increased reported in 
Studies B1371001, B1371002, B1371012 or B1371013. AEs of Blood CPK increased, primarily Grade 1, were 
reported in Studies B1371003 and Study B1371005, with alternate plausible aetiologies (e.g., infection, 
physical exertion, resistant disease) and in some instances occurred >28 days after glasdegib dosing had 
been discontinued. None of these cases were accompanied by other findings suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. 
•  Neurological events 
Peripheral neuropathy AEs have been reported sporadically and were likely related to backbone 
chemotherapy or factors other than glasdegib. Dysgeusia is a known on-target effect of SMO inhibitors. 
Dysgeusia as TRAE was reported in 22.6% of patients in combination arm and none in LDAC alone arm.

There was a higher frequency of skin and subcutaneous disorder SOC TRAEs reported in the glasdegib + 
LDAC arm (29.8%) compared with the LDAC-alone arm (7.3%). Most of the AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. Alopecia is a known class effect of SMO inhibitors; and was reported in 10.7% of patients in 
combination arm and none in LDAC alone arm. Also, in the glasdegib + LDAC arm, 6% of rash (including 1 
grade 3) were reported as TRAE and none in LDAC alone arm.  
There was a single case of Grade 3 Dermatitis exfoliative in a patient receiving glasdegib plus 7+3. Other 
than that single case, there were no exfoliative AEs reported in clinical trials of glasdegib, and there were no 
reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Toxic epidermal necrolysis as of the 11 October 2018 data cut-off 
date.

Patients with Myelofibrosis Previously Treated with Ruxolitinib. Glasdegib in monotherapy was tested in a 
lead-in cohort of ≥20 patients previously treated with ≥ 1 licensed or experimental JAKi. Although the drug 
was considered safe and tolerable in MF, a key secondary efficacy endpoint was not met. Therefore, 
continuation into the randomized part did not occur.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse events  
Serious adverse events were reported for 78.6% of patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 78.0% of 
patients in the LDAC-alone arm. Treatment-related Serious adverse events were reported for 32.1% of 
patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 12.2% of patients in the LDAC-alone arm.

•  Deaths 
The deaths reported in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms were 5 (6.0%) and 5 (12.2%) in 
≤30 days and 10 (11.9%) and 13 (31.7%) in ≤60 days from the first dose of study treatments, respectively.

Over half of the deaths occurred during the follow-up period (after 28 days following the last dose of study 
treatments): 39 out of 64 and 23 out of 40 deaths in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and LDAC alone arms, 
respectively. No death due to study treatment toxicity has been reported by the Applicant.  
There were 2 Grade 5 AEs that were treatment-related per investigator and reported within 28 days post-
dose, 1 in each treatment arm.  
- 
Pneumonia in the glasdegib + LDAC arm, 
-  Sepsis in the LDAC arm. 
Among the “other” deaths derived from the Case Report Form, pneumonia seems to occur more frequently in 
the glasdegib arm (5 out of 13 patients vs 2 out of 12).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 101 patients (AML + MDS) were treated with the combination glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC. Among 
these 101 patients, 89 were AML patients (75 treated in part 2 and 14 in part 1b) and 12 were MDS patients 
(9 treated in part 2 and 3 in part 1b). The safety profile assessment of glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC in this 
report has been focused on the randomized Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003 (S1 cohort).  
The median treatment duration was 1.8-fold longer in the glasdegib + LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm 
(83.0 vs. 47.0 days). The median treatment exposure time of glasdegib was 75.5 days with a large range of 
exposure time: 3 to 954 days.  
Percentage of patients with treatment-related TEAEs was 1.4-fold higher (81.0 vs. 58.5%) in combination 
compared to LDAC alone arm. Although the number of patients was 2-fold higher in glasdegib + LDAC arm 
than in LDAC alone arm, 6.3-fold higher number of TEAEs have been observed in the combination arm 
(n=521 vs. 83). 85% of TEAEs were glasdegib-related. This overview of treatment-related treatment-
emergent AEs logically showed that glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC led to a higher toxicity compared to a 
treatment of LDAC alone.  
Overall TRAEs reported in >=10% patients in any pool (S1 cohort, S2A and S4 Pool) have shown that 
hematologic disorders were the most frequent TRAEs reported in both arms. All grades included, higher 
proportions of patients presented with febrile neutropenia (14.3 vs. 7.3%), anaemia (31 vs. 14.6%), 
thrombocytopenia (23.8 vs. 12.2%), white blood count decreased (11.9 vs. 2.4%) in combination arm 
compared to LDAC alone arm. Gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders were also observed in higher 
proportion in combination arm: nausea (28.6 vs. 2.4%), diarrhoea (16.7 vs. 2.4%), constipation (11.9 vs. 
7.3%), abdominal pain (6 vs. 2.4%), fatigue (22.6 vs. 9.8%), oedema peripheral (7.1 vs. 2.4%). Higher 
decreased appetite (25 vs. 4.9%) and dyspnoea (11.9 vs. 2.4%) were observed in the combination arm. 
Some TRAEs were observed only in combination arm (22.6% dysgeusia, 20.2% muscle spasms, 14.3% 
weight decreased, 10.7% alopecia, 2.4% ALAT increased).  
Globally, higher proportions of patients with grade 3 (23.8 vs. 7.3%) and grade 4 (40.5 vs. 24.4%) TRAEs 
were reported in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm. The Applicant was requested to further 
discuss the higher occurrence of these grade 3/4 events in the combination arm.  It is acknowledged that 
these data could be due to a longer median duration of study treatment in the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 
may due to mean cumulative dose at time of onset. All treatment-related AEs (including febrile neutropenia, 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) have been thus mentioned in Table 6 of the SmPC section 4.8 as 
requested. A cumulative toxicity due to cumulative dose could not be excluded. 
Serious TRAEs were reported in 32.1% patients in glasdegib + LDAC arm compared to 12.2 % patients in 
LDAC alone arm. In LDAC alone arm, serious TRAEs were reported in two different SOC: 9.8 % in blood and 
lymphatic system disorders including 4.9% febrile neutropenia; 4.9% of infections and infestations including 
2.4% pneumonia and 2.4% sepsis. In combination arm, serious TRAEs were reported in several SOC: blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (16.7%) including febrile neutropenia (11.9%), anaemia (4.8%); infections 
and infestations (11.9%) including pneumonia (4.8) and sepsis (2.4%); gastrointestinal disorders (6%) 
including gastrointestinal haemorrhage (1.2%); general disorders and administration site conditions (3.6%) 
including fatigue (2.4%); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3.6%) including muscle spasms 
(1.2%), muscular weakness (1.2%), myalgia (1.2%); nervous system disorders (3.6%) including 
haemorrhage intracranial (1.2%); cardiac disorders (2.4%) including cardiac failure (1.2%) and ventricular 
fibrillation (1.2%). These results showed some of the off target pharmacodynamic effects of glasdegib. One

Assessment report

Grade 5 serious TRAEs was reported in each arm: 1 pneumonia in combination arm and 1 sepsis in LDAC 
alone arm.  
The main cause of deaths was disease under study in both arms. Fewer number of deaths have been 
described in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm in the both periods: ≤ 28 days after the last dose 
(23.8 vs. 36.6%) and > 28 days after the last dose (39.3 vs. 46.3%). The Applicant reported no deaths due 
to the study treatment. There were 2 Grade 5 AEs that were treatment-related per investigator and reported 
within 28 days post-dose (1 pneumonia in the combination arm and 1 sepsis in LDAC alone arm).  
Among the deaths derived from the Case Report Form, pneumonia seems to occur more frequently in the 
glasdegib arm (5 out of 13 patients vs 2 out of 12). Based on the available data, pneumonia could not be 
excluded as related to the treatment, and this AE has been included in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Thirty (30 [35.7%]) and 19 (46.3%) patients permanently discontinued study treatments due to AEs in the 
glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively. The most common AEs leading to 
discontinuation were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia and nausea which are common AEs in AML patients due 
to the disease itself and to chemotherapy treatment (LDAC), although cytopenias including febrile 
neutropenias were more frequently observed in the glasdegib + LDAC arm. Nine (10.7%) and 3 (7.3%) 
patients discontinued study treatment due to treatment-related AEs in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC and 
LDAC alone arms, respectively. Although 1 SOC was imputed in the LDAC alone arm (all 3 patients 
discontinued treatment due to blood and lymphatic system disorders; 2 grade 4 and 1 grade 3), several 
SOCs were imputed in combination arm. Indeed, among the 9 patients, permanent discontinuations were 
reported with the following events:  1 grade 4 sepsis, 3 grade 3 ADRs (1 febrile neutropenia, 1 
lymphadenitis, 1 QT prolongation, 1 muscular weakness, 1 skin toxicity) and also grade 1/2 ADRs (3 
gastrointestinal disorders, 1 blood creatinine increased, 1 fatigue, 1 dysgeusia). In the same way, higher 
proportions of patients [31 (36.9%) vs. 2 (4.9%)] were reported to have treatment-related AEs that led to 
temporary discontinuations of study treatments in combination arm and LDAC alone arm respectively. In the 
combination arm, the same variability of SOCs were imputed. Finally, 21 [25.0%] patients were reported to 
have treatment-related AEs that led to dose reductions of study treatments in combination arm with 19% of 
grade 3/4 events. None were reported in LDAC alone arm.  Unresolved events have been observed after 
permanent or temporary treatment discontinuations and dose reductions of glasdegib. Reasonable 
explanations for unresolved adverse events have been provided by the Applicant. 
The following special safety topics have been discussed in detail by the Applicant: QT interval prolongation, 
renal toxicity, cytopenic events, musculoskeletal events, neurological events, skin and other dermal 
conditions, reproductive and development toxicities.  
According to the ICH E14 recommendation, the thorough QT B1371023 study is positive and an effect on the 
corrected QTinterval has been demonstrated at the therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. This result of 
this study has been mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In the B1371003 study, 6 patients (7.1%) in 
combination arm versus none in LDAC arm reported increased QT interval. Four out of 6 were grade 3/4 
ADRs. QT prolonged has been mentioned in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. Management of ECG QT 
prolongation has been proposed in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 which is acceptable. 
Five (5) renal events related to treatment have been reported in glasdegib + LDAC arm and none in LDAC 
alone arm in patients with medical history of renal function abnormality. This suggests that glasdegib could 
worsen renal impairment. Renal toxicity is currently listed in the Risk Management Plan as an important 
potential risk which is acceptable. Warnings and recommendations for patients with medical history of renal 
impairment have been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 132/143   
 
  
 
 
Concerning cytopenic events, the rate of TRAEs was slightly higher in combination arm (25%) compared to 
LDAC alone arm (22%) in S1 cohort for all grades. However, higher proportions of patients with grade 3/4 
(14.3 vs. 2.4%) were reported in combination arm and none in LDAC alone arm. Anaemia, febrile 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia have been added in the adverse reaction table in the SmPC 
section 4.8. 
One event of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Grade 3) and one event haemorrhage intracranial (grade 4) have 
been observed in glasdegib + LDAC arm. The transfusion-dependent history of the patient who developed the 
Haemorrhage intracranial could explain this outcome. The gastrointestinal haemorrhage was not further 
explained. The haematology laboratory test abnormalities were generally similar in the 2 arms. 
Haemorrhages were reported as treatment-related in B1371003 study and have thus been reported in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
20.2% of muscle spasms, 22.6% dysgeusia and 10.7% alopecia were reported as TRAEs in glasdegib + LDAC 
arm. These AEs are known class effects of SMO inhibitors. None of these AEs has been reported in LDAC 
alone arm. Also, 6% of rash (including 1 grade 3) were reported as TRAE in the glasdegib + LDAC arm, and 
none in LDAC alone arm. Dose modifications and warnings for Muscle-related adverse events have been 
proposed in SmPC sections 4.2 4.4 and 4.7. 
The Applicant submitted data of the S2A Pool (including AML patients in part 1b and part 2 unfit). Proportions 
of TRAEs, TR SAEs, grade 3/4 TRAEs, doses reduction due to TRAEs, temporary discontinuations due to 
TRAEs were high and similar between S1 cohort and S2A pool which confirmed the higher toxicity of 
glasdegib + LDAC in AML patients. 
Otherwise, higher proportions of patients with TRAES in combination arm (89.2%) compared to LDAC alone 
arm (58.5%) was also observed in S4 pool, showing a higher risk of glasdegib also with 7+3 therapy. 
Except 1 grade 3 mucosal inflammation and 4 grade 3 lipase increased, these safety data from the 
monotherapy studies did not show TRAE (with higher severity than grade 3) which was not identified in 
B1371003 pivotal study. These monotherapy data should be interpreted with cautiun due to the different 
design of the studies, the different population targeted, the different doses of glasdegib used. 
Increased ASAT/ALAT have been observed in glasdegib monotherapy studies. The currently proposed SmPC 
recommends in Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration (Assessment and monitoring of laboratory 
abnormalities) that hepatic function be assessed prior to the initiation of glasdegib and at least once weekly 
for the first month and dose modification in presence of non-haematological toxicity, and this 
recommendation is considered adequate.  
Given that the risk of embryo-foetal toxicity is very limited since the intended population is at a low risk of 
pregnancy as compared to the approved indication population for the other SMO inhibitors, no pregnancies 
have been reported, the SmPC has a boxed warning in section 4.4 for the risk of reproductive and 
developmental toxicity with a cross-reference to section 4.6, according to guideline on risk assessment of 
medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labeling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005), 
the recommendation level proposed by the Applicant “should not be used” is acceptable, and a Pregnancy 
Prevention Program is considered not necessary. The duration of contraception (30 days = 5 half-lives) post 
last dose of glasdegib is acceptable. Concerning breast-feeding, there is no argument in particular on 
bioavailability in favour of a conservative approach imposing a delay of 25 additional days. Therefore, a delay 
of one week after the last dose is appropriate. The risk minimisation measure in a form of the patient alert 
card has also been agreed.

Assessment report

Due to the mechanism of action of glasdegib, incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies has not 
been assessed which is acceptable 
Long-term safety data are not available in this application. With only 4 patients, all in the glasdegib + LDAC 
arm, remaining on treatment as of 03 January 2017, additional data collected afterwards have not been 
provided as they would not be expected to significantly change the efficacy results already observed. Updated 
data on 14 patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm treated for >1 year have been provided. No new safety 
data of clinical concern have been noted. The CHMP considers that submitted information is acceptable.  
Since one phase 1b/2 has been submitted to support the MAA, CHMP raised a concern that the relatively low 
number of AML patients precluded a comprehensive safety assessment. Therefore, the Applicant was 
requested to justify in detail, how the requirements for a marketing authorisation could be fulfilled. The 
concern was that despite convincing efficacy results, there could be a risk for more rare and unforeseeable 
adverse events with the combination of glasdegib and LDAC. The Applicant provided additional data from the 
additional patients in the glasdegib development program, which did not identify new safety concerns in unfit 
AML patients. Stomatitis, pyrexia, oedema peripheral, sepsis, urinary tract infection and atrial fibrillation were 
added to the SmPC section 4.8.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile assessment of glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC in this report has been focused on the 
randomized Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003 (S1 cohort including 75 AML patients and 9 MDS patients).  
The safety profile of glasdegib 100 mg PO once daily in combination with LDAC is characterised by a pattern 
of toxicities typically observed in AML patients treated with chemotherapy and toxicities associated with SMO 
inhibitor therapy. Generally, the toxicity seems reasonably well manageable as well as acceptable in these 
poor prognosis, elderly, unfit AML population, given the current treatment options.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21 November 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of glasdegib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers glasdegib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union Product information.  
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Daurismo (glasdegib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

Glasdegib is indicated in combination with LDAC chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed de novo 
or secondary AML in adult patients who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.  
AML is a cancer of the haematopoietic system characterized by increased proliferation of bone marrow and 
peripheral blasts, pancytopenias causing infections and bleeding, and reduced survival. Given that the 
majority of patients are older and unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy, the treatment intention 
pursued with less intensive therapies such as LDAC, azacitidine, or decitabine, is to prolong the overall 
survival.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In patients who care not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy, less toxic non-intensive therapies 
as LDAC, azacitidine or decitabine may prolong OS versus best supportive care, but there are fewer complete 
remissions and shorter OS than with intensive chemotherapy, with little chance for cure compared to more 
intensive chemotherapies such as induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (7 days) plus daunorubicin (3 
days) (7+3). Thus, there is a need to improve treatment outcomes in patients who cannot receive intensive 
chemotherapy.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is mainly based on Study B1371003, a multi-centre, open-label phase 1b/2 study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of glasdegib when administered in combination with first-line treatment regimens for 
AML and high-risk MDS. The efficacy of glasdegib + LDAC was investigated in the study’s phase 2 part 
compared to LDAC alone in patients who were not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy (unfit 
population), more than 95% were 65 years of age or older.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The difference in OS (primary endpoint) was statistically significant (8.8 versus 4.9 months median; HR = 
0.51, p = 0.0004) between glasdegib + LDAC vs LDAC. The data were considered mature, with 109 of 132 
(82.6%) of observed events in AML + MDS patients having by the efficacy data cut-off date, and with a 
median follow-up time >20 months for each treatment arm.  
The statistically significant improvement of OS has been confirmed in the subgroup of patients with AML (8.3 
versus 4.3 months median; HR = 0.46; p = 0.0002). The number of patients in the MDS arm is very small; 
efficacy data for MDS could not be assessed.  
Patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC arm had statistically 
significant improvement in OS as compared to those with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the LDAC 
alone arm (12.2 versus 4.8 months median; HR = 0.43; p = 0.0008) in the AML + MS population. A 
significant OS improvement is confirmed in the subgroup of patients with AML (11.1 versus 4.4 months 
median; HR = 0.42; p = 0.001).  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 137/143   
 
  
 
 
In the AML population, subgroup analyses showed improvement in OS in patients with de novo disease (6.6 
versus 4.3 months median; HR = 0.67; p = 0.099), secondary disease (9.1 versus 4.1 months median; HR = 
0.29; p <0.0001) and poor cytogenetic risk (4.1 versus 3.1 months median; HR = 0.53; p = 0.027). 
In the AML + MDS population, significantly higher complete remission rates have been observed in the 
combination arm: 17% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.01. This result was confirmed in AML patients: 17.9% vs. 2.6%; p 
= 0.02.  
3.3.  The SmPC section 4.2 recommends that glasdegib should be continued as 
long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit. Uncertainties and limitations 
about favourable effects 
It is a limitation of study B1371003 that reliable conclusions could not be drawn from an OS analysis between 
patients older and younger than 65 years of age, due to the very small numbers of patients <65 years old 
enrolled in this study and this is reflected in the SmPC section 5.2.  
Considering the unmet medical need in these patients and the improvement in OS with an oral 
chemotherapy, an improvement on quality of life was acknowledged. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The median treatment duration was 1.8-fold longer in the glasdegib + LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm 
(83.0 vs. 47.0 days). 
The percentage of patients with treatment-related TEAEs was 1.4-fold higher (81.0 vs. 58.5%) in 
combination compared to LDAC alone arm. Although the number of patients was 2-fold higher in glasdegib + 
LDAC arm than in LDAC alone arm, 6.3-fold higher of TEAEs have been observed in the combination arm 
(n=521 vs. 83). 85% of TEAEs were glasdegib-related. This overview of treatment-related treatment-
emergent AEs showed that glasdegib 100 mg + LDAC led to a higher toxicity compared to a treatment of 
LDAC alone. 
Hematologic disorders were the most frequent TRAEs reported in both arms. All grades included, higher 
proportions of patients with febrile neutropenia (14.3 vs. 7.3%), anaemia (31 vs. 14.6%), thrombocytopenia 
(23.8 vs. 12.2%), white blood count decreased 11.9 vs. 2.4%) were observed in combination arm compared 
to LDAC alone arm.  
Gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders were also observed in higher proportion in combination arm: 
nausea (28.6 vs. 2.4%), diarrhoea (16.7 vs. 2.4%), constipation (11.9 vs. 7.3%), abdominal pain (6 vs. 
2.4%), fatigue (22.6 vs. 9.8%) and oedema peripheral (7.1 vs. 2.4%). Higher decreased appetite (25 vs. 
4.9%) and dyspnoea (11.9 vs. 2.4%) were observed in the combination arm. Some TRAEs were observed 
only in combination arm (22.6% dysgeusia, 20.2% muscle spasms, 14.3% weight decreased, 10.7% 
alopecia, 2.4% ALAT increased). 
Globally, higher proportions of patients presented with grade 3 (23.8 vs. 7.3%) and grade 4 (40.5 vs. 
24.4%) in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm. 
Serious TRAEs were reported in 32.1% patients in glasdegib + LDAC arm compared to 12.2% patients in 
LDAC alone arm. Although, serious TRAES were reported in only two different SOCs in LDAC alone arm: blood 
and lymphatic system disorders and infections. Many SOC were implicated in the toxicity of glasdegib + LDAC 
compared to LDAC alone arm which showed multi-organ toxicities of the combination.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report

The following special safety topics have been identified by the Applicant: QT interval prolongation, renal 
toxicity, cytopenic events, musculoskeletal events, neurological events, skin and other dermal conditions 
which are known effect of SMO inhibitors. Especially, 20.2% of Muscle spasms, 22.6% dysgeusia and 10.7% 
alopecia were reported as TRAEs in glasdegib + LDAC arm. None of these AEs has been reported in LDAC 
alone arm. Also, 6% of rash (including 1 grade 3) were reported as TRAEs in the glasdegib + LDAC arm, and 
none in LDAC alone arm. 
Nine (9; 10.7%) and 3; 7.3%) patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs, in the glasdegib 100 mg 
+ LDAC and LDAC alone arms respectively. In the same way, higher proportions of patients were reported 
[31 (36.9%) vs. 2 (4.9%)] to have treatment-related AEs that led to temporary discontinuations of study 
treatments in combination arm and LDAC alone arm respectively. Finally, 21 (25.0%) patients were reported 
to have treatment-related AEs that led to dose reductions of study treatments in combination arm with 19% 
of grade 3/4 events. None were reported in LDAC alone arm. 
The main cause of deaths was disease under study in both arms. Lesser number of deaths have been 
described in combination arm compared to LDAC alone arm in the both periods: ≤ 28 days after the last dose 
(23.8 vs. 36.6%) and > 28 days after the last dose (39.3 vs. 46.3%).  
Finally, considering the high number of AML patient in the B1371003 study, the safety profile of glasdegib in 
AML patient could be considered consistent with the safety profile assessed in the overall population 
(AML+MDS). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Five Renal events related to treatment have been reported in glasdegib + LDAC arm and none in LDAC alone 
arm in patients with medical history of renal function abnormality. This suggests that glasdegib could worsen 
renal impairment. Renal toxicity is currently listed in the Risk Management Plan as an important potential risk 
which is acceptable. Warnings and recommendations for patients with history of renal impairment are in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
One event of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Grade 3) and one event intracranial haemorrhage (grade 4) have 
been observed in glasdegib + LDAC arm. The transfusion-dependent history of the patient who developed the 
intracranial haemorrhage could explain this outcome. The gastrointestinal haemorrhage was not further 
explained and is included among haemorrhages that are reflected in the SmPC.  
Among the deaths derived from the Case Report Form, pneumonia seems to occur more frequently in the 
glasdegib arm (5 out of 13 patients vs 2 out of 12). Based on the available data, pneumonia cannot be 
excluded to be related to treatment, this AE has been included in Table 4 of the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Newly-diagnosed AML in patients who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy, represents a 
difficult clinical situation to conduct clinical trials due to a poor prognosis, short overall survival and co-
morbidity. The phase 2, randomised Study B1371003 is a valid clinical trial to introduce a novel anti-
leukaemic agent in combination with standard chemotherapy, in this case low-dose cytarabine (LDAC). The 
demonstration of a clear benefit in OS treated by the combination compared to monotherapy with the SOC 
(LDAC) and a concomitant higher frequency of state of remissions in Study B1371003 therefore indicate an 
important progress in the management of this frail patient group, for which disease-specific therapeutic 
improvements are lacking. 
The supportive care in terms of anti-microbials and transfusion standards have improved over the last two 
decades. It is essential in this context that the adverse events to treatment are acceptable, well known and 
manageable. The safety profile of glasdegib may be characterised as relatively benign, but still adds some 
toxicity to the SOC. The importance of the add-on toxicity effect of glasdegib must not be disregarded, and it 
had an impact on dose reductions.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R of glasdegib is positive in the claimed indication. The main study, B1371003, showed that glasdegib 
+ LDAC resulted in a statistically and clinically significant improvement in OS over LDAC alone in newly-
diagnosed patients with AML who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. The safety profile was 
considered acceptable in these poor prognosis, elderly, unfit AML population, given the current treatment 
options. Therefore, it can be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
The introduction of targeted therapies such as glasdegib in unfit patients with AML is important, because 
standard induction chemotherapy may be replaced by combinations aiming to spare normal cells, mitigating 
the treatment burden with standard chemotherapy and creating an option for novel regimens, more effective 
by a combination of different targets.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Daurismo, in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed 
de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients who are not candidates for standard 
induction chemotherapy is positive.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 141/143   
 
  
 
 
 
 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Daurismo is not similar to Dacogen, Rydapt, Mylotarg, Vyxeos, 
Xospata within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Daurismo is favourable in the following indication: 
Daurismo is indicated, in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed de 
novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients who are not candidates for standard 
induction chemotherapy.   
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
EMA/CHMP/284008/2020 
Assessment report  
Page 142/143   
 
  
 
 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where DAURISMO is marketed, all male patients are 
provided via their prescribing physicians with the Patient Alert Card. The Patient Alert Card should contain the 
following key elements:  
•  Glasdegib may be present in semen carrying a potential risk of reproductive and developmental 
toxicity  
•  Effective contraception (condom with spermicide, if available) should be used, even after vasectomy 
and for at least 30 days after the last dose due to the potential risk of exposure of male patients’ 
female partners to glasdegib through semen 
•  The importance of informing a healthcare provider as soon as a pregnancy is suspected, either for a 
female patient or female partner of a male patient 
•  A reminder not to donate semen while taking Daurismo and for 30 days after last dose  
•  The recommendation to seek advice on effective fertility preservation for men prior to initiating 
treatment with glasdegib. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that glasdegib is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1. 
Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark submitted on 2 September 1999 to the European Agency 
for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), an application to obtain a marketing authorisation 
in accordance with the Centralised Procedure for the medicinal product NovoMix 30 (insulin aspart) 
falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Council Regulation No (EC) 2309/93. 
NovoMix 30 is a mixture of 30% soluble insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals. 
On  7  September  1999,  a  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  has  been  granted  for  100%  soluble 
insulin aspart, named NovoRapid (EU/1/99/119/001-008). In order to avoid misleading information on 
the release profile of the mixture, the applicant wishes to market the mixture under a different name 
(“NovoMix 30” instead of “NovoRapid”). On this basis, a separate full application in accordance with 
Directive 65/65/EEC, as described in the Notice to Applicants, was submitted. 
The CPMP appointed the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur as follows: 
Rapporteur:  
Dr. Per Sjöberg  
Dr. Per Nilsson 
Co-Rapporteur: 
Dr. Gorm Jensen  
Dr. Mark Ainsworth 
Licensing status: 
The product was not licensed in any country inside or outside the EU at the time of submission of the 
application.

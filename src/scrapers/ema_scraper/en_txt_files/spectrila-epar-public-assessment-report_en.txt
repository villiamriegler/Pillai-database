2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms that result from 
monoclonal proliferation and accumulation of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and 
other organs.  
ALL is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and represents 25% of cancer diagnoses among 
children younger than 15 years. In absolute terms, however, ALL is a very rare disease, even in children. 
Its incidence has a bimodal distribution with a sharp peak among children aged 2 to 3 years (>90 per 
million per year), with rates decreasing to 30 per million by age 8 years  
(NCI at the NIH: Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment, March 2013). A second steady 
increase in the incidence of ALL begins at approximately 50 years of age, with a peak incidence of about 
2 per 100,000. Overall, estimated incidence in the EU is 1.28 per 100,000 persons, corresponding to a 
total of approximately 5,600 new cases per year. 
The recognised chromosomal abnormalities in ALL result in biological differences in the condition, and are 
important for prognosis and for therapeutic decisions. For example, Philadelphia chromosome positive 
(Ph+) ALL, which is caused by the translocation of the BCR and the ABL genes, is associated with a very 
poor prognosis. 
ALL is divided into subtypes based on the presence of B- or T-cell lineage-specific differentiation antigens 
detected on the surface of leukaemic blast cells. Precursor B-cell ALL (including early pre-B and pre-B-cell 
ALL) is the most common (approximately 70% to 80%) subtype in both children and adults. Mature B-cell 
ALL (Burkitt’s leukaemia / lymphoma) has been reported in 2% to 5% of children and adults. T-cell ALL 
has been diagnosed in 15% to 25% of paediatric and adult patients with ALL. It occurs more commonly 
in older adolescents and young adults than in young children, with an incidence of approximately 25% of 
all ALL in patients 16 to 21 years of age. 
The treatment for ALL typically consists of a remission-induction phase, an intensification (or 
consolidation) phase and continuation / maintenance therapy to eliminate residual disease. Treatment is 
also directed to the Central Nervous System (CNS) early in the clinical course to prevent relapse 
attributable to leukaemic cells sequestered in this site (Pui et al, 2008). 
Treatment depends on the use of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy given over 6 to 9 months in 
combination with central nervous system prophylactic therapy with cranial radiation and intrathecal 
chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy for 2 to 3 years.  
All phases of treatment involve combination chemotherapy. Current treatment guidelines (European 
LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) recommend treatment with Tyrosine Kinase 
Inhibitors (TKIs). In Europe, the following TKIs are currently approved for the treatment of ALL and LBL: 
Glivec (imatinib); Sprycel (dasatinib); Tasigna (nilotinib); Iclusig (ponatinib). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 9/132 
  
  
 
 
In addition, drugs used during induction typically include vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and L-asparaginase. Cytarabine and methotrexate are often added during consolidation / 
intensification. Maintenance therapy frequently includes 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, steroids and 
vincristine (NCCN guideline, November 2015). 
Allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation is of great importance especially in patients at high risk or after 
a recurrence. 
All these protocols involve the use of L-asparaginase during induction and consolidation /intensification 
phases. The objective of asparaginase therapy is to deplete physiological asparagine so that it is 
unavailable to tumour cells. 
Historically, native E coli-derived asparaginase was used as the initial intervention. However, 
treatment-limiting immune response can occur. Once hypersensitivity is apparent, it is necessary to 
switch to a different asparaginase preparation. Therapy can then continue until a treatment-limiting 
immune response to the substituted asparaginase occurs.  
Excellent progress has been made in the therapy of childhood ALL over the past five decades with 
combination chemotherapy and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis having improved the cure rate 
from 5% in 1950 to 85% in 2000 (Bailey et al, 2008). In contrast, while dose-intense multi-agent 
regimens administered to adult patients with ALL now achieve remission rates exceeding 80%, 5-year 
survival is only around 40% (Faderl et al, 2008). 
About the product 
Spectrila is a recombinant L-asparaginase produced in E. coli. The amino acid sequence and enzymatic 
activity of the recombinant asparaginase has been developed to be identical to Asparaginase medac 
which is an asparaginase preparation derived from a natural E.coli mutant.  
Asparaginase hydrolyses asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia.  In contrast to normal cells, 
lymphoblastic tumour cells have a very limited capacity for synthesising asparagine because of a 
significantly reduced expression of asparagine synthetase. Therefore, they require asparagine which 
diffuses from the extracellular environment. As a result of asparaginase-induced asparagine depletion in 
serum, protein synthesis in lymphoblastic tumour cells is disturbed while sparing most normal cells. 
Asparaginase may also be toxic to normal cells that divide rapidly and are dependent to some degree on 
exogenous asparagine supply.  
Due to the asparagine concentration gradient between the extra- and intravascular space, asparagine 
levels are subsequently also reduced in the extravascular spaces, e.g. the cerebrospinal fluid. (see SmPC 
section 5.1). 
The applicant claimed the following indication: 
Spectrila 10,000 U is indicated as a component of a curative antineoplastic combination therapy for 
infants, children, adolescents and adults with acute B/T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia or B/T cell 
lymphoblastic lymphoma.  
The CHMP recommended the following indication: 
Spectrila is indicated as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy for the treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years and adults. (see SmPC section 
4.1). 
Spectrila should be prescribed and administered by physicians and health care personnel experienced in 
the  use  of  antineoplastic  products.  It  should  only  be  given  in  a  hospital  setting  where  appropriate 
resuscitation equipment is available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 10/132 
  
  
 
Spectrila is usually employed as part of combination chemotherapy protocols with other antineoplastic 
agents (see also section 4.5 of SmPC). 
The  recommended  intravenous  dose  of  asparaginase  is  5,000  units  per  square  metre  (U/m²)  body 
surface area (BSA) given every third day.  
Treatment may be monitored based on the trough serum asparaginase activity measured three days after 
administration  of  Spectrila.    If  asparaginase  activity  values  fail  to  reach  target  levels,  a  switch  to  a 
different asparaginase preparation could be considered (see section 4.4). 
The daily amount of Spectrila needed per patient can be diluted in a final volume of 50 – 250 ml sodium 
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. The diluted solution of asparaginase may be infused over 
0.5 to 2 hours. Asparaginase must not be administered as a bolus dose (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Active Substance 
General information 
Asparaginase is an enzyme obtained from Escherichia coli (E. coli) which converts asparaginase to 
aspartic acid and ammonia. The active substance, recombinant asparaginase, differs from wild type (wt) 
asparaginase at four amino acid positions. The active substance asparaginase (asparaginase 
aminohydrolase) appears as white crystals and is freely soluble in water. It is active as a homotetramer, 
with a total molecular mass of 138,368 Da (approximately 35 kDa per monomer). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured according to standard techniques for the bulk production of a 
recombinant protein/medicinal product from E. coli using a plasmid expression system with a MCB and 
WCB. The plasmid contains an engineered version of the wt gene leading to a protein with 4 amino acid 
substitutions. Induction occurs by elevating the temperature which inactivates the repressor protein. The 
pre-asparaginase produced (with signal peptide) is secreted by a cellular translocation mechanism during 
which the signal peptide is cleaved post-translationally yielding mature asparaginase in the periplasm of 
the cells. One vial of the WCB is used for the pre-fermentation culture which is then used to inoculate the 
production culture. This is then followed by harvesting, homogenisation and filtration prior to purification 
using sequential chromatography steps.  
Description of Manufacturing Process  
In summary; a pre-culture is developed from a vial of the WCB for the inoculation of the production 
fermenter. The product is harvested by homogenisation of the cells and purified in three chromatographic 
steps before being conditioned and filtered (0.2 µm). A batch comprises the protein purified from a single 
harvest derived from fermentation of one vial of the WCB. The culture broth is processed so that the batch 
size consists of approximately 480 g of purified bulk active substance. 
Description of upstream processing and fermentation 
A frozen cryovial of the WCB is allowed to thaw at room temperature and the cells are then resuspended 
by mixing. The contents of the cryovial are used to inoculate a pre-culture fermenter containing 
fermentation medium which is qualitatively the same as that used for production fermentation. During 
pre-culture fermentation, the cells are cultured under defined conditions. The pre-culture cell suspension 
is then harvested and used to inoculate the production fermenter. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 11/132 
  
  
 
Following inoculation of the production fermenter, the cells are cultured under defined conditions in two 
steps. In the first step (up to nutrient limitation), the cells multiply, while in the second step μ-control 
(additional nutrient feed) is switched on to enable high cell density fermentation. 
The cells are allowed to grow in the fermenter at a defined temperature for a fixed time range, after which 
time production of asparaginase is induced by a temperature shift. The fermentation process is 
terminated by gradually reducing the temperature. 
Description of downstream processing and purification 
The fermentation broth is transferred to the downstream processing suite and processed further. 
Homogenisation is performed in three cycles.  
After sampling, the homogenate is subjected to tangential flow. Microfiltration is performed in three 
steps: 
1. diafiltration (1) against phosphate buffer, 
2. concentration, and 
3. diafiltration (2) against phosphate buffer. 
The microfiltration permeate containing the active substance is concentrated. The ultrafiltration retentate 
is then diafiltered against phosphate buffer and subsequently diluted. Clarification steps are performed 
prior to loading the first chromatography step. AEC (anion exchange chromatography) is performed using 
a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with 
the AEC-loading material and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the 
column. Elution is performed and the AEC main fraction is collected. CEC is performed in two separate 
cycles using a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. In each cycle, half of the AEC main 
fraction is used as the starting material. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with the conditioned 
AEC main fraction and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the column. IPCs 
tests are performed separately on the two CEC main fractions. Like CEC, HIC is performed in two separate 
cycles using a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. The starting material for each HIC 
cycle is one of the two CEC main fractions. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with the 
conditioned CEC main fraction and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the 
column. The pooled HIC main fraction containing the active substance is recirculated from the diafiltration 
vessel through an ultrafiltration unit. 
Conditioning of the bulk active substance solution is performed in three steps: 
1. Diafiltration (1) against WFI. 
2. Concentration to the target final weight. 
3. Diafiltration (2) against WFI. 
Following conditioning, the bulk active substance solution is pumped through a filtration unit. 
The filtered active substance is collected in a sterile bag and stored at 2 – 8°C until being shipped to the 
finished product manufacturer. Prior to storage, samples of the filtered drug substance solution are taken 
for release testing. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation focused on analysis of the minor peaks around the main peaks from SEC and RP-HPLC 
analysis. Peaks additional to the main peak have been categorised as product-related substances or 
product-related impurities and are acceptably characterised. The product-related substances consist of 
pre-peaks and post main peaks (RP-HPLC), ‘group 1’ and ‘group 2’ substances respectively. The activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 12/132 
  
  
 
of these peaks has been shown to be almost indistinguishable to the main tetrameric fraction. No 
truncation variants have been identified. Product related impurities are defined as the aggregates and 
monomer identified by SEC. Earlier development batches have been characterised for charge isoform 
variants; however the Applicant had not fully developed and validated a suitable method at the time of 
initial submission. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is the favoured method which will be introduced. 
As this is stability indicating the Applicant has been requested to introduce the validated method prior to 
approval. This has been confirmed and the Applicant has validated the method for both active substance 
and finished product. In addition, acidic and alkaline variants were characterised, particularly in terms of 
impact on efficacy and safety. A characterisation report has been subsequently provided. The two isoform 
species identified are tetrametic in nature (acidic and alkaline components) and correlate well with 
species detected by AEC (which correlate with the RP-HPLC species). Please see stability of active 
substance and finished product discussions below. The enzyme activity of these species are sufficiently 
similar to the activity of the main isoform variant. No effect on efficacy and safety is expected.  
Process-related impurities (DNA/HCP/Endotoxin) are routinely maintained at acceptable levels. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Four categories of IPCs are used to monitor, adjust and control process performance at each stage of the 
manufacturing process. Set points, technical controls and manufacturing controls mostly represent 
physical parameters which the Applicant stated can only vary within predefined limits controlled by 
largely automated equipment (temperature, time, pH, glucose, oxygen, pressure, volume, flow rate etc). 
The parameters and ranges of IPCs (in-process controls) are considered acceptable and appear suitable 
for control of the upstream and downstream processes. It was initially considered that a number of the 
IPCs were wide, as specifications had been set based on pilot and commercial scale batches, however the 
affected IPCs have been satisfactorily tightened. 
Process validation 
Process validation was conducted using the three full-scale batches. IPCs for all upstream and 
downstream processing steps and release data are in good agreement demonstrating the capacity to 
manufacture a consistent active substance. Evidence for suitable validation of the 
microfiltration/ultrafiltration filter, column chromatography lifetime, cleaning validation and active 
substance transport validation for the full scale process have also been provided. The holding time 
specifications for the micro/ultrafiltration retentate have been validated. The commercial-scale 
manufacturing process is suitably validated. 
Manufacturing process development and comparability 
There have been extensive changes to the active substance manufacturing process since early 
development, which have been divided into processes I-V, where V is  ‘pilot scale’ and then up-scaling 
from pilot scale to ‘commercial scale A‘. The most significant changes were the introduction of a new 
antibiotic free MCB and significant up-scaling of the process. No commercial scale or ‘pilot scale’ batches 
have been tested in clinical trials (only earlier development batches from process II and III). So 
comparability was required to be demonstrated between the commercial-scale process and the material 
used in clinical trials. The initial finding of comparability by the applicant was not fully supported and this 
was a concern raised during the procedure. The Applicant has since provided a more comprehensive 
comparability assessment, to address the concerns raised. The differences in CZE, AEC and MS/MS 
parameters were generally related to the age of the early batches tested (isoform degradation products 
are clearly evident from stability studies) or the way the samples were treated in the case of the MS/MS 
data. Comparability at the level of active substance has been acceptably demonstrated.

Specification 
The proposed release tests are acceptable, including measures of enzyme activity, and methods to 
control for product-related substances and product related impurities (aggregates). Several specifications 
have been tightened nevertheless, it was considered that further tightening could be made some 
specifications. The specifications have been tightened. As the specification is based on limited 
commercial-scale batches the Applicant is recommended to review the specification when more clinically 
tested batches are produced and to revise the specification with a post-approval variation as appropriate.  
Reference standard 
No compendial reference standard is available for r-L-asparaginase. During evaluation a suitable 
standard for the active substance and finished product was introduced.  
Stability 
Data was only available for one batch at the recommended time-point, therefore further data to support 
the initial shelf-life claim was requested. Taking into account that all other parameters were within 
specifications and there is evidence that the levels of main peak and isoform species are clinically qualified 
with no likely impact on efficacy and safety, an appropriate shelf-life was accepted based on the data 
provided at the time of the Opinion.  
2.2.2.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Composition of the product 
The finished product is a sterile, lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 
10,000 U of the active substance asparaginase. The finished product contains sucrose as excipient. After 
reconstitution with water for injections the preparation is administered by intravenous infusion as 
indicated in the SmPC. 
The container of the product consists of a colourless glass vial, a rubber stopper and a safety aluminium 
cap.  
Process Development 
Four lots of finished product have been manufactured at pilot scale for clinical trials. The changes that 
took place between these lots were changes in the active substance manufacturing process, introduction 
of a new manufacturer for the finished product and removal of citrate buffer from the initial finished 
product formulation. It has been clarified that the lyophilisation time for these two clinical trial batches 
was also equivalent. Comparability of the finished product was sufficiently demonstrated for these 
batches.  
However, following clinical trials the process has seen a change in MCB (antibiotic free) and up-scaling of 
the active substance/ finished product manufacturing processes to commercial scale. Only one full scale 
finished product commercial batch had been manufactured to GMP at submission (two others were 
non-GMP) which was not tested in clinical trials, therefore the Applicant conducted a comparability 
assessment, based on analysis of characterisation, IPC and release data. The statement of comparability 
was not fully supported as there were differences in the CZE profile of the finished product identified 
during characterisation and also a number of differences in the release data, which had not been suitably 
discussed, particularly in terms of expected impact on clinical outcome. The Applicant has subsequently 
submitted a more comprehensive comparability report which addresses the differences observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 14/132 
  
  
 
 
Sufficient comparability has been demonstrated as it was concluded that the differences seen are 
relatively minor and also not considered to impact on clinical efficacy and safety.   
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture consists of formulation (with sucrose and water for injections (WFI)) filtration (bioburden 
reduction and sterile filtration), aseptic filling and lyophilisation steps. There were some issues raised 
concerning the control of the process, (wide acceptance criteria in some cases, for example osmolarity) 
however these issues were adequately resolved. There was considerable variability seen in the pH for the 
three commercial-scale batches which the applicant was requested to address. In their response, the 
Applicant stated that the pH electrode may not be the most appropriate to use. A new system has been 
implemented and the Applicant has subsequently tightened the specification for pH which is considered 
acceptable.    
The ‘commercial scale’ process was validated through manufacture of three successive validation 
batches. All validation issues have been considered suitably resolved. 
Product specification 
The key finished product release tests are based on those used to characterise the finished product. The 
release tests are acceptable; however there were several issues which required clarification. The 
Applicant was requested to set release specifications which more suitably reflected the commercial scale 
batches for RP-HPLC for the finished product. Also the need for shelf-life specifications was questioned for 
the main peak. The Applicant has tightened the specifications and also removed the shelf-life 
specification. In addition, the specification for HPSEC was requested to be tightened and the shelf-life 
specification was not justified by stability data. The Applicant has tightened the specification and the 
shelf-life specification has been removed. It appeared that the proposed release specifications for CZE 
were not clinically qualified. The Applicant has set release specifications for CZE based on the commercial 
manufacturing process and it can be concluded that the CZE specification is clinically qualified. The 
specifications can be accepted. Batches used in the clinic were retrospectively tested by CZE and the 
commercial-scale batches were within a sufficiently similar range, despite the age of the clinical batches. 
The stability of these old batches was also confirmed by AEC and RP-HPLC which were highly comparable 
to newly manufactured commercial batches. The Applicant was recommended to revisit some 
specifications when more commercial batch data for this new method becomes available and to submit a 
post-approval variation as appropriate. 
Stability of the product 
A significant concern during the procedure regarding stability of the finished product was raised, as there 
was a possible minor downward trend in the main peak as detected by CZE with a concomitant increase 
in alkaline isoform species. As limited stability and characterisation data were available it could not be 
determined whether this decrease would have an impact on efficacy and safety. The Applicant has 
provided further data and requested a shelf-life of 30 months. Real-time data is available for 2 
commercial scale batches at 24 months. The data do further confirm a minor decrease in the main 
peak/increase in alkaline isoform. However, the enzyme activity of the isoform species has been shown to 
be sufficiently similar to the main peak, so no effect on efficacy and safety are expected. Batches used in 
the clinic and commercial batches were comparable and the values at 24 months are sufficiently similar 
to the retrospective analysis of clinical trial batches. All other measurement parameters showed no 
trends. Therefore this concern was considered resolved and a shelf-life of 24 months (2-8ºC) can be 
accepted. However, as the stability data is limited, the Applicant is recommended to place the first three 
commercial batches following approval of the MAA on stability and to update the stability testing program 
to be in-line with ICH Q5C.

Adventitious agents 
The product presents minimal risk from adventitious agent contamination. E. coli do not harbour 
mammalian viruses. There is suitable control of raw and starting materials, including characterisation of 
the cell bank, and no materials of animal or human origin are used in the manufacturing process. The 
production process contains several filtration steps to reduce any potential contamination and also 
includes in-process controls and release tests for the detection of adventitious agents, including 
endotoxins and bioburden. The active substance and finished product manufacturers also have 
GMP-certified hygiene measures in place. The adventitious agent safety evaluation presented is sufficient 
and adequate. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
There were three Quality significant concerns raised in the initial assessment in relation to the clarification 
of different active substance/finished product manufacturing ‘scales’; comparability between batches 
used during clinical studies and the commercial manufacturing process and stability of the finished 
product. The Applicant provided adequate justifications and additional data and therefore these concerns 
were considered adequately resolved.  
The first three commercial batches following approval of the MAA should be placed on stability and the 
stability testing program should be updated to be in-line with ICH Q5C. Some release specifications when 
more commercial scale batches used in the clinic are available should be revised. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and satisfactory 
documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the active substance as well as the finished 
product can be reproducibly manufactured. 
2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended some additional points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Recombinant asparaginase (ASNase) was compared with the marketed reference preparation 
Asparaginase 10,000 E Medac in several pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies 
(including toxicokinetics and evaluation of the immunogenic potential). In addition, non-comparative 
studies to evaluate the effects of different dose-schedule on in vivo PD, safety pharmacology aspects,  
and local tolerance were carried out with rASNase. As different batches and formulations of rASNase have 
been used in non-clinical studies, a summary is provided in the table below.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A number of publications from 1953 to 2006 describing the pharmacodynamic activity of various forms of 
L-asparaginase were submitted. The Applicant also provided reports of 8 non-clinical studies summarising 
the results obtained with different versions of r-L-asparaginase.  A summary of available data is provided 
below.

The kinetic properties of the conventionally purified preparation of ASNase isoenzyme II from wild-type E. 
coli (Asparaginase 10000 E medac) and rASNase (MC1102) have been compared with special emphasis 
on the substrate specificities of the two preparations.  No significant differences in the kinetic parameters 
of both ASNase preparations were detected. 
The estimated Km values of 0.49 ± 0.05 mM for L-AHA and 3.9 ± 0.4 mM for L-GLN were in agreement 
with published data [Campbell, 1969; Miller, 1969b].  There were no significant differences between the 
pH-activity profiles of both ASNase preparations with any of the three substrates (L-ASN, L-AHA and 
L-GLN). 
In vitro studies investigating anti-neoplastic activity 
The anti-proliferative activities of Asparaginase 10000 E medac and rASNase batches MC1102 and 
MC0703, at 0.001 – 100 U/mL, have been compared in vitro using two different ASNase-sensitive human 
cell lines in two separate studies. Asparaginase 10000 E medac and rASNase both showed a 
dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in the two cell lines tested compared to control.   
In vitro studies described in the literature 
In  vitro  studies  analysed  the  cytotoxic  effect  of  ASNase  on  isolated  blood  cells  from  patients  with 
leukaemia  and  revealed  that  this  effect  is  dependent  on  dose  and  sensitivity  of  cells  against  ASNase 
[Schreck, 1967; Schreck 1971]. 
Subsequently,  the  effect  of  native  ASNase  on  the  in  vitro  survival  of  bone  marrow  mononuclear  cells 
obtained from previously untreated patients with ALL was described by Asselin and coworkers (1989). 
The in vitro killing of leukaemia cells was independent of concentration from 0.0001 to 0.1 U/ml (P = 0.3 
to 0.7), suggesting the absence of a dose response at ASNase concentrations tested.  Addition of these 
lower ASNase doses markedly decreased the L-ASN concentration in culture medium [Asselin B et al., 
1989].  
Guo Q-L et al. described the establishment of a recombinant ASNase from a system (PKA/CPU210009) 
that displayed extremely high expression efficiency for this enzyme [Guo, 2002].  Both, in vitro and in 
vivo  studies  which  were  performed  by  this  group  of  investigators,  confirmed  that  the  antineoplastic 
activity of the recombinant ASNase, was as effective as wild-type ASNase [Guo, 2002]. 
In vivo studies 
In a murine model of leukaemia, the anti-leukaemic activity of rASNase (Batch F1AS9917/1/SF/P4) was 
tested and compared to that of Asparaginase 10000 E medac.  Cyclophosphamide was used as reference 
compound [Report MV5893, 2000].  Neither Asparaginase 10000 E medac nor rASNase induced a 
significant change in survival time when compared to control.   
Effects on human leukaemia xenografts in SCID mice:  The ALL-SC19 model was used to compare the 
antileukaemic activity of rASNase (Batch F1AS9917/1/SF/P4) and Asparaginase 10000 E medac to that of 
the reference compound vincristine [Report MV5907, 2000]. Tumours of mice treated with rASNase 
developed in a similar manner to those in control mice.  Tumours of mice treated with Asparaginase 
10000 E medac or vincristine disappeared within the treatment period and did not regrow by Day 50.  
Asparaginase 10000 E medac and vincristine caused a distinct reduction in body weight.   
Further investigations were performed in order to clarify the reason for the observed results. The 
anti-leukaemic activities of three lyophilised ASNase preparations (rASNase containing aspartate, 
ASNase 10000 E medac, and rASNase without aspartate) were evaluated using the human acute 
lymphatic leukaemia (ALL-SCID-19) model in mice (strain NOD/SCID) and compared to the reference 
compound, vincristine.  At 4,000 U/kg, an equivalent long-standing anti-leukaemic effect was observed 
with all ASNase preparations.  At that dose, ASNase preparations were significantly more effective than 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 18/132 
  
  
 
the reference compound, vincristine when administered at the maximum tolerated dose. The delay of 
leukaemia development was significantly increased at 4,000 U/kg ASNase when compared to that 
observed with vincristine. At 1,000 U/kg, Asparaginase 10000 E medac (100 % complete remission with 
regrowth from Day 35) was significantly superior to rASNase regarding the delay of development of 
leukaemic nodules.  All preparations were equally well tolerated and induced moderate, dose-dependent 
reductions in body weight without lethality.  The stabiliser, aspartate had no influence on the 
anti-leukaemic activity of the final lyophilised product, rASNase. 
A third study was performed in order to elucidate whether any differences in anti-leukaemic activity exist 
between Asparaginase 10000 E medac and rASNase [Report MV6773, 2003].  Control animals were 
treated with water/saline and positive control animals were treated with vincristine (1 mg/kg i.p. on Day 
13).  Asparaginase 10000 E medac led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth.  At 
8,000 U/kg/day, all mice were tumour-free by Day 36; then regrowth was observed.  At 500 U/kg/day an 
optimum T/C value of 8 % was observed with 1/10 complete remissions.  Recombinant ASNase (Batch 
MC0703) revealed significantly lower anti-leukaemic activity at equal dose levels compared to 
Asparaginase 10000 E medac. Treatment with rASNase showed significant T/C values between 41% (at 
2000U/kg) and 7% at 8000U/kg and 500U/kg was completely inefficient.  A 16-fold higher dose of 
MC0703 (8,000 U/kg/day) was equally effective with 500 U/kg/day Asparaginase 10000 E medac.  The 
two ASNase preparations were well tolerated with mild body weight loss observed in both groups.    
In order to assess the impact and the hypothesis that different aggregates which are sporadically present 
in the clinical preparation of Asparaginase 10000 E medac could be responsible for different 
pharmacological effects, the anti-leukaemic activity of five different ASNase preparations were tested 
with the aid of the ALL-SCID 19 model in mice [Report MV6838, 2004]. According to their anti-leukaemic 
activity (high activity to low activity), the test preparations were ranked: Isolated high molecular weight 
aggregates from Asparaginase 10000 E medac > Asparaginase 10000 E medac> tetramers = rASNase = 
bulk agent.  All preparations led to a significant, dose-dependent inhibition of leukaemia growth. 
Aggregates resulted in complete remissions at 1,000 or 8,000 U/kg/day lasting until Day 25 or 35, 
respectively. The anti-leukaemic activity was comparable to those of Asparaginase 10000 E medac at a 
dose of 8000 U/kg/day and significantly better at the lower dose of 1000 U/kg/day.  Both, Asparaginase 
10000 E medac and aggregates caused a substantial number of complete remissions, but finally the 
tumours regrew.  All preparations were well tolerated and were not associated with mortality. 
Based on former investigations with rASNase, different schedules of rASNase administration have been 
compared in order to analyse whether anti-leukaemic efficacy is schedule-dependent. Daily 
administration for five days (one or two injections per day) was compared to treatment every other day 
for 4 days, which is the schedule used in the previous studies [Report MV7001, 2004]. The twice daily 
schedule resulted in the highest efficacy among the schedules tested: complete remissions were observed 
in 10/10 mice between Days 36 and 44, respectively.  Tumour regrowth started on Day 47, but 6/10 
animals were tumour-free at sacrifice on Day 64. Bolus injection of the same daily dose did not induce 
complete remissions and the mice had to be sacrificed with large tumours on Day 49.  Treatment every 
two days caused complete remissions in 6/10 animals on Day 41, and 1/10 animals remained tumour-free 
by day 49.  Vincristine led to transient complete remissions in 9/10 mice, but tumours regrew.  All 
treatment schedules were well tolerated; however, body weight loss was recorded in all groups with the 
maximum body weight loss (- 14 %) observed in the most effective group.  Sustained levels of ASNase 
between sequential injections seemed to be most effective.  The twice daily treatment resulted in highest 
efficacy and caused 60 % tumour-free survivors.  
A number of in vivo studies have been described in the literature, investigating different treatment 
schedules in mice [Vadlamudi, 1970]; [Sugiura, 1969]; investigating the sensitivity of seven paediatric 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia xenotransplanted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice [Fichtner, 2003];

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies were submitted on secondary pharmacological effects of r-L-asparaginase which was

Effects on insulin release and glucose homeostasis have been described in numerous studies [Khan, 
1969] [Lavine, 1980; Lavine 1984]; [Pou, 1991]; [Clausen, 1989]. 
Effects on the pancreas:  Pancreatic toxicity occurs most likely due to an inhibition of insulin synthesis 
caused by reduced levels of amino acids ASN and probably GLN. About 5 % of human adults treated with 
ASNase develop overt pancreatitis that may be fatal. Fatal haemorrhagic pancreatitis after ASNase 
therapy was reported in one dog which was treated for multicentric malignant lymphoma with ASNase 
(12,000 U) [Hansen, 1983]. 
Effects on the liver: It is thought that one of the main reasons for ASNase toxicity is its glutaminase 
activity. L-glutamine is the main form of nitrogen transportation in blood, and prolonged depletion of this 
amino acid during asparaginase therapy causes serious biochemical disorders in the body, particularly in 
liver [Capizzi, 1970; Oettgen, 1970). A glutaminase-free asparaginase with potent anti-lymphoma 
activity isolated from Vibrio succinogenes was not hepatotoxic even after prolonged treatment [Durden, 
1983]. 
Effects on coagulation: Several investigations show that ASNase treatment of acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia patients causes severe deficiency in antithrombin with the consequence of increased risk of 
thrombosis.  However, the mechanism responsible for the decrease of plasma antithrombin caused by 
ASNase remains elusive [Hernandez-Espinosa, 2006]. Coagulation disorders can occur due to the 
inhibition of protein synthesis caused by ASNase [Rogers, 1992]. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential for drug interactions following co-administration with methotrexate, 
1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, dexamethasone and vincristine has been described. 
Co-administration with methotrexate (MTX) 
ASNase inhibits protein synthesis and cell replication, thus, it may interfere with the action of MTX which 
requires cell replication for its anti-neoplastic effect [Capizzi, 1974; Capizzi, 1981].  
Co-administration with cytosine arabinoside (1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine; ara-C) 
A schedule-dependent effect of ara-C and ASNase was observed both in vitro and in vivo. A sub-additive 
therapeutic effect of simultaneous exposure of ASNase and ara-C was observed in the murine leukaemia 
cell line L5178Y/asn-. The observed synergy was thought to be related to the timing of ASNase treatment 
and the “optimal therapeutic effect” occurs when sequential ASNase is administered before the cells 
recover from the ara-C effect [Schwartz, 1982]. 
Co-administration with dexamethasone 
The incidence of osteonecrosis is as high as 20% in children treated for ALL. It is assumed that 
glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DXM) are responsible for the induction of osteonecrosis. ASNase 
hastened the occurrence of osteonecrosis which was observed as early as 4 weeks [Yang, 2009]. In a 
mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis, the frequency of osteonecrosis after 6 weeks of 
dexamethasone plus ASNase was comparable to that observed following 12 weeks of dexamethasone 
alone.   
Co-administration with vincristine (VCR) 
ASNase decreases hepatic clearance of VCR, resulting in prolonged half-life and increased toxicity 
[Rogers, 1989]. Experiments in dogs have shown that the toxicity of vincristine may be additive with that 
of ASNase if both agents are administered concomitantly [Rogers 1989; Northrup 2002]. 
The effects of L-ASNase on hepatic clearance/metabolism of VCR may also be responsible for the 
observed neurotoxicity when the two agents are co-administered [Martindale Monographs, 2002].

The combination of DEX with VCR and ASN resulted in a significantly higher exposure to DEX when 
compared to DEX alone as observed in a panel of childhood ALL continuous xenografts derived from 
primary patient biopsies (ALL-7 and ALL-19) [Szymanska, 2012]. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The primary aim of the pharmacokinetic studies conducted was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
rASNase preparations compared to that of the reference product, Asparaginase 10000 E medac.  The 
preparations were generally administered as a single intravenous dose to mice and dogs. In addition, the 
effects of the ASNase on serum levels of L-asparagine (ASN) were determined. Analytical methods and 
pharmacokinetic studies conducted in dogs were performed in accordance with GLP. 
Table 3: Absorption studies conducted on behalf of the Applicant 
In  study  MV6839,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  5  different  ASNase  preparations  was  determined 
following single i.v. injection in female mice (strain: NOD/SCID).  Following the observed efficacy profile 
in  the  mouse,  the  hypothesis  was  that  aggregate  content  in  the  preparations  could  influence  the 
pharmacokinetic features and subsequently lead to different anti-leukaemic activity.  Mice (n=27/group) 
received a single i.v. injection (2,000 U/kg) of the ASNase preparations.  Serum was analysed by means 
of the NH3 assay [LPT 17488/03] and interpreted with a non- and three-compartment model. 
Isolated aggregates from Asparaginase 10000 E medac (58 % aggregates) and the clinically used 
Asparaginase 10000 E medac (20.5 % aggregates) had much longer retention times in mice (t1/2= 5.54 
and 3.17 hours, respectively) in comparison to the three remaining rASNase preparations with a 
proportion of only 0.4-1.0 % aggregates (t1/2 = about 1.3 hours). In line with these findings, higher AUC 
and lower clearance values for high-aggregate content preparations (groups A ‘Asparaginase Medac’ and 
B ‘Aggregates (Asparaginase Medac)’) were observed when compared to low-aggregate content 
preparations (C ‘tetramers (Asparaginase Medac)’ – E ‘rASNAse (bulk agent)’). Isolated aggregates from 
Asparaginase 10000 E medac showed a 4-fold increase in half-life of ASNase activity as well as a 
three-fold increased area under the curve (AUC) compared to isolated tetramers. Results of isolated 
tetramers from Asparaginase 10000 E medac were clearly comparable with results obtained with both 
batches of rASNase (groups D ‘rASNase (MC0703)’ and E ‘rASNase (bulk agent)’). Furthermore, high AUC 
values and slow elimination clearly correlated with the highest anti-leukaemic activity as determined in 
the corresponding pharmacodynamic study previously described. 
In study LPT 13106/2/01, the pharmacokinetic properties of rASNase (Batch MC0201) and Asparaginase 
10000  E  medac  were  compared  in  the  beagle  dog  (n=3/group)  following  single  i.v.  administration  at 
1000U/kg. No mortality was observed during the 8-day follow-up/observation period. Once or repeated

vomiting was noted in all 3 animals treated with rASNase at 2 – 6 hours post-dose. Two of three animals 
vomited repeatedly between 2 and 6 hours after administration of Asparaginase 10000 E medac. Results 
from each assay are presented below. 
NH3 assay: At fifteen minutes post dose, rASNase or Asparaginase 10000 E medac resulted in a mean 
maximum ASNase serum activity (Cmax) of 15,103 U/L and 23,022 U/L, respectively.  These values 
decreased to a mean ASNase serum activity of 577 U/L and 905 U/L for rASNase and Asparaginase 10000 
E medac, respectively at 96 hours post dose. 
AHA assay: At fifteen minutes post dose, rASNase or Asparaginase 10000 E medac resulted in a mean 
maximum ASNase serum activity (Cmax) of 14,939 U/L and 14,220 U/L, respectively. These values 
decreased to a mean ASNase serum activity of 619 U/L and 830 U/L for rASNase and Asparaginase 10000 
E medac, respectively at 96 hours post dose. 
MAAT assay: At fifteen minutes post dose, rASNase or Asparaginase 10000 E medac resulted in a mean 
maximum ASNase serum activity (Cmax) of 12,282 U/L and 18,460 U/L, respectively. These values 
decreased to a mean ASNase serum activity of 490 U/L and 841 U/L for r-ASNase and Asparaginase 
10000 E medac, respectively, 96 hours post-dose. 
Overall,  lower  AUC  values  have  been  determined  following  rASNase  when  compared  to  Asparaginase 
10000 E medac. T½ was between 16.1 and 24.8 hours for the tested preparations. The amino acid serum 
levels were affected to a similar degree by the two ASNase preparations. Due to the remaining ASNase 
levels in serum 96 hours post-dose, no recovery of amino acids was possible until 8 days post-dose of the 
compounds. 
Overall, depending on the ASNase activity assay used, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the 
AUC for the reference product (in terms of the mean values); however, taking the observed variability 
into account, overall the observed Cmax and AUC values were statistically similar. 
In a follow up study, the pharmacokinetic properties of a different batch of rASNase (Batch MC0703) were 
compared to that of Asparaginase 10000E medac [LPT 16750/03].  Single i.v. doses of 250 or 1,000 U/kg 
were administered to dogs (n=5/group). Following intravenous administration of a single dose of ASNase, 
no mortality or no signs of toxicity were observed.  AUC0-168h increased in a dose-related manner. Serum 
activity levels decreased with time and t1/2 ranged from 18.36 to 20.71 hours. There were no differences 
in the pharmacokinetic parameters for both preparations tested.   
In a separate study, the pharmacokinetic properties of two lyophilised rASNase preparations (MC1003 
and MC1005) were compared in dogs following single i.v. administration [report LPT 19030/05 and IKP 
study  no.:  077/05-055.AE].    The  rASNase  MC1005  formulation  is  a  lyophilised  drug  product  without 
citrate buffer.  Animals (n=5/group) were given rASNase at 1,000 U/kg via slow intravenous injection. 
Administration of MC1003 or MC1005 resulted in a comparable AUC0-168 and Cmax of activity (measured 
via the AHA assay).  No statistical difference was observed between the lyophilised rASNase preparations 
MC1003 and MC1005; hence exposures were similar irrespective of citrate content/inclusion. 
Asparaginase is distributed mainly within the intravascular space, with minimal blood-brain barrier 
penetration. Therefore, ASN depletion by ASNase mainly occurs within the intravascular space. Since this 
builds up a concentration gradient between extra- and intravascular space, ASN levels are subsequently 
reduced in the extravascular spaces, e.g. the cerebrospinal fluid [Schwartz, 1970]. 
Several studies concerning the distribution of ASNase preparations in different species have been 
described in literature [Broome, 1968]; [Pütter, 1970]; [Pütter J, 1970]. The metabolic disposition and 
elimination of ASNase are unknown. The disappearance of ASNase activity from blood is at least partly 
due to the distribution of the enzyme into the extravascular fluid and clearance via the reticuloendothelial 
system. No accumulation in the body and no excretion in the urine were observed in ASNase-treated

dogs. The drug is partly metabolised by plasma proteases as it was first demonstrated with purified 
kathepsin isolated from beef spleen extract [Pütter, 1970]. More recently, two lysosomal cysteine 
proteases, cathepsin B (CTSB) and asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) have been identified in different ALL 
cell lines and human leukemic cell lysates. Both proteases degrade ASNase.  This pathway of degradation 
may also be responsible for the generation of the antigenic protein fragments for anti-asparaginase 
antibody production [Patel, 2009].  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicity studies have been conducted with rASNase preparations in rat and dog following intravenous and 
intramuscular injection to reflect the intended route for human use. Additionally, subcutaneous, 
paravenous and intra-arterial administration have been applied to assess potential toxicity at injection 
sites made accidentally. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study in rats was performed to evaluate acute overdosing in humans.

Data from the literature showed the effects of asparaginase in several species(see table below). 
Asparaginase was associated with several toxicities, including hyperglycaemia, hypolipoproteinaemia, 
hypoalbuminaemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, respectively.  The 
LD50 values of acute toxicity studies with ASNase in different species are summarised in the table below.

All species tested generally exhibited varying degrees of decreased activity, weakness, anorexia, and 
weight loss.  Mice and rats were found to tolerate extremely large doses of ASNase without any apparent 
damage to tissues. Acute toxic effects consisted of limb spread, flaccidity, and hyperpnea [Schein et al., 
1969].  In cats and dogs, decreased motility, anorexia, weakness and weight loss was observed as well as 
vomiting. Doses of up to 10,000 IU/kg were tolerated without significant adverse effect other than 
vomiting [Lorke, 1970]. 
Rabbits appeared very sensitive to ASNase administration. The LD50 value was substantially lower than 
that observed in the mouse. In a pyrogen assay of 14 different enzyme batches, a syndrome consisting of 
papillary constriction, profuse salivation, convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and death, occurred over a 
period of 24 – 72 hours after drug administration and was observed in 11 animals (22 %) receiving either 
167 or 200 IU/kg i.v. The remaining 40 animals were observed for 7 days after injection, during which 
they showed no overt signs of toxicity [Oettgen, 1967]. 
Fifty percent of New Zealand white rabbits died between 24–47 hours after a single intravenous injection 
of 200 IU/kg and 1,000 IU/kg of ASNase [Oettgen, 1967; Chisari, 1972; Young, 1973].  The parathyroid 
was identified as the organ targeted by the enzyme.  Similar damage of the parathyroid gland 
(hypoparathyroidism) was manifested in 40 Chinchilla rabbits after administration of 1,000 or 5,000 
IU/kg ASNase by way of tetanic symptoms, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and in most cases by 
hyperphosphataemia followed by increased mortality [Tettenborn, 1970]. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were provided and corresponding toxicokinetic evaluations have been 
performed.   
An overview of studies 16367, 16368 and 16374 is presented below.

The antigenicity of rASNase was determined in the course of four-week toxicity studies (in rats and dogs). 
The determination of anti-asparaginase antibody titers (non-GLP) in rats revealed an increase of 
anti-asparaginase antibody titers only in low-dose treated animals (100 U MC1102/kg/day) on test Days 
21 and 28. Intermediate and high-dose treated rats (at ≥  100 U/kg) did not show an increase of antibody 
titers at any time and it was suggested that the detection of anti-dug antibodies may not be possible in 
the groups of animals given the maximum dose of 10000 U/kg/day. In dog, the observed ADA induction 
was independent of dose and was evident up until the last day of dosing (Day 28). 
Adverse effects on the liver (e.g. morphological evidence of cytolysis), alterations of the endoplasmic 
reticulum in spleen and thymus, and a clear increase in the content of cellular lipid were observed in 
Wistar rats following intraperitoneal administration of the enzyme, but rats did not show evidence of 
significant immunogenic toxicity [Celle et al., 1973; Cooney DA et al., 1975]. 
L-asparaginase caused effects on the parathyroid in a large percentage of rabbits. Primary findings 
associated with ASNase treatment included body weight loss, decreased food consumption, nausea, 
diarrhoea and hypersensitivity at the higher doses. On pathohistological examination, fatty disposition in 
liver cell and change of reticulum cells in spleen and thymus were observed without dose response 
relation [Ohguro, 1969].  In a separate publication, intravenous administration of E. coli ASNase to 
rabbits resulted in high incidence of hypocalcaemia (100 %), and tetany (70 %) [Young, 1973].

Anaphylactic episodes have been reported [Cooney, 1975].  Rhesus monkeys treated intravenously with 
ASNase developed varying degrees of weight loss, colitis, leukopenia, and abnormal liver function.  
Anorexia and weight loss were associated with therapy, and were generally reversible [Schein, 1969]. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were provided but literature data have been presented. 
The  mutagenicity  of  ASNase  was  tested  in  the  Ames  microbial  mutagenicity  test  using  Salmonella 
typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, and TA92. L-asparaginase (152 IU, 455 IU, 909 IU per plate) was not 
mutagenic to either strain with or without S9 mix used for metabolic activation.  Moreover, it had no lethal 
effect at doses of up to 3 mg/plate (909 IU) [Seino, 1978].  Similar results were observed when ASNase 
was evaluated at 5, 50 and 500 μg (1.51, 15.1, 151 IU) per plate using Salmonella typhimurium strains 
TA98 and TA100 [Pak, 1979]. 
In  a  separate  study,  the  chromosomal  analysis  of  7  pregnant  New  Zealand  white  rabbit  females  and 
fetuses  treated  with  ASNase  (50  or  100  IU/kg  i.v.)  showed  normal  karyotypes.    In  vitro,  ASNase 
decreased  the  mitotic  index  of  rabbit  white  blood  cell  cultures  without  altering  the  karyotype. 
Furthermore,  analysis  of  liver  preparations  from  20  fetuses  obtained  from  the  treated  does  revealed 
normal karyotypes even though 3 fetuses had gross malformations [Adamson, 1970]. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were provided. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The embryotoxic and teratogenic effect of native E. coli ASNase was well established since the 1970s and 
was studied in vitro as well in vivo at different stages of pregnancy in mice, rats, chicken and rabbits 
[Adamson,  1968a;  Adamson,  1970;  Ohguro.,  1969;  Lorke,  1970;  Sanfeliu,  1986,  1989;  Domenech 
Mateu, 1974]. 
Embryotoxicity studies which were conducted mainly with ASNase preparations from E. coli suggest a 
potential for teratogenicity in different species. The spectrum of results in mammalian species ranges 
from  “no  finding”  in the  rat  [Adamson,  1968a;  Adamson,  1970]  to  the  appearance  of  malformations, 
mainly  in  the  central  nervous  system  (spina  bifida,  hydrocephalus)  as  well  as  cardiac  and  skeleton 
anomalies, gastroschisis, and missing tail among the offspring of mice, rats, rabbits and chicken, treated 
with L-asparaginase during pregnancy [Adamson, 1970; Ohguro, 1969; Sanfeliu, 1986; Sanfeliu, 1989].

Local Tolerance  
The Applicant provided a series of local tolerance studies which are outlined below. 
Table 8: Local Tolerance studies  
Single rASNase injections to various sites revealed good local tolerance in rats after i.v., i.a. and s.c. 
administration, respectively. The intramuscular (i.m.) and paravenous (p.v.) administration revealed a 
moderate inflammatory reaction. 
Single Asparaginase 10000 E medac injections to various sites revealed an excellent local tolerance in the 
rat  at  the  i.v.  and  s.c.  administration  sites.  The  i.m.,  i.a.  and  p.v.  administration  sites  revealed  a 
moderate  inflammatory  reaction.  The  local  tolerance  test  of  a  new  citrate-buffer  free  formulation  of 
lyophilised rASNase MC1005 revealed an excellent tolerance following single i.v., i.m., i.a., p.v. and s.c. 
injection in rats. This therefore supports the intended clinical use of the final product rASNase MC1005. 
No macroscopic or microscopic findings of concern were noted at the injection sites. 
Other toxicity studies 
The potential for immunotoxicity has been described in the literature. 
Effects on antibody producing cells 
With respect to its recognized immunosuppressive properties, previous work has shown that in mice, 
ASNase preferentially inhibits antibody-precursor cells in the bone marrow (Friedman, 1971), and inhibits 
both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. A considerable decrease of antibody-producing cells 
(about 90 %) was observed in a 3-month toxicity study in male and female Wistar rats. Animals were 
treated daily for 7 days with 3,200 IU/kg (i.p.) ASNase from E. coli or from Erwinia carotovora.  The effect 
was roughly dose-dependent and apparently more marked after treatment with L-ASNase from E. coli. 
The immunosuppressive effect of ASNase appeared to diminish with treatment, especially in rats treated 
with the Erwinia carotovora enzyme, and the lower dose was more immunogenic than the higher one for 
both types of enzymes (Cavanna, 1976). 
Effects on T or B lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation 
L-asparaginase has long been known to be a potent inhibitor of the in vitro response of lymphocytes to 
mitogen stimulation. The mechanism of inhibition of PHA- or SAC-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis 
by ASNase has been reported not to be ASN depletion but GLN depletion [Kitoh et al., 1992]. 
Immunosuppressive effects of asparaginases 
Several studies have shown immunosuppressive effects of ASNase on both humoral and cell-mediated 
immune reactions [Durden, 1980, 1981].

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products for 
Human use [CHMP/SWP/4447/00] the Applicant submitted a justification for not submitting an ERA. 
Considering asparaginase is a recombinant protein, it is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment. The justification was considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the data presented, the enzymatic and structural properties of the proposed product, 
recombinant asparaginase appear to be similar to that of the asparaginase preparation currently on the 
market derived from Escherichia coli (asparaginase 10,000E medac).  Overall, the batches of 
recombinant asparaginase showed similar anti-proliferative profiles, when compared to the asparaginase 
medac, whereby they both caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation at 0.001 to 100 U/mL.  
However, the anti-proliferative activity afforded by one of the batches (MC0703) at 0.01 and 100 U/mL 
was slightly lower than that of asparaginase medac. However, observed difference between the proposed 
product and the asparaginase medac are not clinically relevant. Follow up investigative in vivo studies 
suggested that in a single species only (the mouse), it is the high molecular weight aggregates within 
asparaginase medac (which typically contains ~20% aggregates) that were responsible for the increased 
efficacy (when compared to that of the proposed product) (see discussion below on pharmacokinetic 
aspects).  
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. Since chemical structure and in vitro activity of 
recombinant ASNase is very similar to that of the ASNase Medac, an extensive evaluation of effects at 
unintended molecular targets is not deemed necessary. 
Non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity and safety pharmacology studies in rats revealed no special hazard for 
humans, except a slight but significant saluretic effect at doses below the recommended dose for ALL/LBL 
patients. Additionally, the urinary pH value and the relative weight of kidneys were increased at 
exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to 
clinical use (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Additional safety pharmacology data from the literature showed that asparaginase has the potential to 
cause hyperglycaemia (and hypoinsulinemia), acute hypersensitivity reactions (and possibly pancreatitis) 
and disturbances in hepatic function (e.g. increased liver lipid levels and decreased plasma levels of 
albumin) and clotting (subsequent to a deficiency of antithrombin III).  With the exception of the effects 
on insulin levels, the observed effects occurred at doses that were greater than those proposed clinically 
(on a U/m2 basis). These observed effects are included in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8).  
No new pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with r-asparaginase. However, the 
potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other chemotherapeutic agents has been described 
based data from the literature. Inhibition of protein synthesis secondary to the asparaginase-induced 
depletion of asparagine has been shown to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of MTX which requires cell 
replication for its antineoplastic activity. This antagonism is observed if asparaginase is administered prior 
to or concurrently with methotrexate. Conversely, the antitumour effects of methotrexate are enhanced 
when asparaginase is administered 24 hours following methotrexate treatment. This regimen has been 
shown to reduce the gastrointestinal and haematological effects of methotrexate. (see SmPC section 
4.5).  
In addition, there is in vitro and in vivo evidence to suggest that the therapeutic/anti-leukaemic effects 
afforded by the anti-metabolic agent, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and asparaginase are 
schedule-dependent. Laboratory in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the efficacy of high-dose

cytarabine is reduced by prior administration of asparaginase. However, when asparaginase was given 
after cytarabine a synergistic effect was observed. This effect was most prominent with a treatment 
interval of about 120 hours.  (see SmPC section 4.5).  
In the mouse, the frequency of osteonecrosis after 6 weeks of dexamethasone plus asparaginase was 
comparable to that observed following 12 weeks of dexamethasone alone, which suggests that 
concomitant administration of dexamethasone and L -asparaginase in mice accelerated the potential 
onset of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis. A synergistic anti-leukaemia effect has been shown in vitro 
when vincristine is administered with asparaginase.  In addition, synergism has been observed in vitro 
and in vivo when vincristine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase are administered in combination. The 
toxicity of vincristine may be additive with that of asparaginase if both agents are administered 
concomitantly. Therefore, vincristine should be given 3 to 24 hours before administration of asparaginase 
in order to minimise toxicity. (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Regarding  pharmacokinetic  studies,  the  analytical  methods  used  appear  to  have  been  adequately 
validated and are considered suitable for use in the determination of L-asparaginase activity.  Potential 
issues were noted with respect to the ELISA used to determined anti-drug antibody levels and it was 
subsequently  clarified  that  the  antibody  profiling  was  of  a  preliminary  nature  as  the  antibody 
determinations  were  not  performed  to  GLP.    To  aid  with  the  characterisation  of  the  pharmacokinetic 
profile, serum levels of asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine and/or glutamic acid were also determined 
using  reverse  phase  high  pressure  liquid  chromatography  (RP-HPLC).  In  the  NOD/SCID  mouse,  the 
observed  anti-leukaemic  efficacy  correlated  with  a  high  content  of  aggregates  in  the  asparaginase 
formulations which displayed significantly higher retention times or half-lives, lower clearance and higher 
AUC  values  (than  that  observed  in  low-aggregate  preparations).  It  is  noted  no  non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic  evaluation  was  performed  on  the  rASNase  batch  intended  to  be  commercialised. 
However, in light of the fact that comparable results have been adequately demonstrated from a quality 
perspective, no further non-clinical studies are warranted. 
Overall,  following  repeated  administration,  the  toxicokinetic  data  generated  suggest  that  there  is  no 
indication of persistent accumulation of recombinant asparaginase in the rat and dog; there was in fact, 
a tendency towards a decrease in serum activity over time. 
Based upon the available data on asparaginase and the fact that the proposed product is expected to 
possess  similar  pharmacokinetic  properties  to  that  of  currently  marketed  forms  of  asparaginase,  the 
Applicant  did  not  perform  any  additional  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion  or  pharmacokinetic  drug 
interaction studies.  This approach is deemed to be acceptable. 
The bigger the molecule, the greater the chance of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Given that the risk of 
hypersensitivity is likely to be of most concern, Section 4.8 of the SmPC and the Risk Management Plan 
inform of this risk. 
Due to the bacterial origin of asparaginase preparations, an antigenic potential resulting in the induction 
of a humoral immune response was expected.  Although discrepancies in the reporting of these data were 
noted and subsequently clarified, overall in the rat, a significant increase in anti-asparaginase antibody 
titre was induced only at the lowest dose of 100 U/kg, whereas a strong increase in anti-asparaginase 
antibody titre was observed in all 3 dose groups in the dog (50 to 450 U/kg).  It is speculated that serum 
antibodies in rats may be absorbed completely, when excessive levels of antigen (asparaginase protein) 
are present in the serum and corresponding toxicokinetic data supported this hypothesis. In contrast, in 
the  dog,  comparably  low  doses  of  asparaginase  (maximum  dose  of  450  U/kg)  may  not  have  been 
sufficient to absorb the anti-asparaginase antibodies. 
The evidence from the literature suggests that asparaginase and therefore the proposed product should 
not cause genotoxicity.  The Applicant has not conducted additional studies, which is in accordance with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 30/132 
  
  
 
the  recommendations  of  ICH  S6.  In  addition,  in  light  of  the  therapeutic  indication  claimed,  the 
post-marketing  experience  gained  with  native  asparaginase  and  its  protein  nature,  the  lack  of 
carcinogenicity study is acceptable. Overall, evidence from published data with asparaginase renders the 
mutagenic, clastogenic and carcinogenic potential of asparaginase negligible (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Following repeated administration in the rat and dog, histological examination of the testis and the ovary 
did not reveal any pathological findings; however, given that the maximum dose administered to the dog 
is  below  that  proposed  clinically  (on  a  mg/m2  basis),  and  given  the  pharmacological  activity  of 
asparaginase,  an  effect  on  fertility  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out.    Hence,  Section  4.6  of  the  SmPC 
advises both males and females to use effective means of contraception. 
No investigation was performed on the influence of fertility and on the potential transfer of this agent to 
breast  milk;  the  proposed  product  should  not  used  during  lactation  in  humans.  There  is  extensive 
information available regarding the potential effects of E. coli asparaginase on embryofetal development.  
The potential for growth retardation, an increased risk of malformations (including those of the central 
nervous  system,  heart  and  skeletal  system)  and  foetal  death  is  evident  from  the  ex  vivo  and  in  vivo 
studies performed at doses that are similar to or in excess of those proposed clinically (on a U/m² basis) 
in a number of species including the mouse, rat and/or rabbit.  The potential for a risk to embryofetal 
development is reflected in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. Section 4.6 of the SmPC advises that patients shall 
use  contraceptive  measures  during  and  up  to  3  months  after  cessation  of  rASNase  containing 
chemotherapy and also warns against the use of the proposed product during pregnancy; overall, this 
approach is acceptable. It is agreed that based on the information available in the public domain that no 
further non-clinical data to describe the effects on embryofetal development are warranted.   
A  series  of  studies  have  been  conducted  in  order  to  assess  the  local  tolerance  following  intravenous, 
paravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial and subcutaneous administration of recombinant asparaginase.  
No macroscopic or microscopic findings of concern were noted at the injection sites.  
Asparaginase  preferentially  inhibits  antibody-precursor  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  and  inhibits  both 
cell-mediated  and  humoral  immune  responses.  Glutamine  hydrolysing  activity  of  E.  coli  asparaginase 
may  contribute  significantly  towards  this  immunosuppression.  Beside  the  depletion  of  ASN,  E.  coli 
asparaginase  reduced  circulating  glutamine  concentrations  and  reduced  protein  synthesis  in  liver  and 
spleen but not in pancreas assuming that the nutrient stress response to asparaginase is tissue-specific 
and exacerbated by glutamine depletion.  The SmPC notes the potential for infections which addresses 
the potential for immunosuppression; hence from a non-clinical perspective, no further action is required. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical package submitted to support this application is acceptable.

2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant claimed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. A GCP inspection 
was triggered on the pivotal study MC-ASP.5/ALL and MC-ASP.6/INF. The inspection uncovered several 
findings.  One  critical  finding  occurred  during  inspection  of  the  bioanalytical  laboratory  and  concerned 
non-adherence  to  the  study  plan  criteria  for  accepting  or  rejecting  calibration  standards  for  the

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Asparaginase is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability of recombinant asparaginase 
after IM administration has not been studied.  
Distribution 
In study MC-ASP.4/ALL, in 14 children/adolescents (age 2-14 years) with de novo ALL, the median 
volume of distribution of r-L-asparaginase at steady state (Vdss) was 0.95 l (range: 0.7 – 2.8 l).  
The mean (SD) of Vdss in seven adult patients in study MC-ASP.2/RHN was 2.47 l (0.45 l) after 
administration of 5,000 U/m² r-L-asparaginase. 
In these two studies, after administration of 5,000 U/m² r-L-asparaginase, median (range) maximum 
serum concentrations of asparaginase activity were 2,324 U/l (1,625 – 4,819 U/l) in 7 adult patients and 
3,350 U/l (2,231 – 4,526 U/l) in 14 children/adolescents respectively.  
In adult patients, the peak (Cmax) of asparaginase activity in serum was reached with a delay of 
approximately 2 hours after the end of the infusion whereas in most children/adolescents Cmax was 
reached at the end of infusion.  
A summary of the PK parameters reported in study ASP.2/RHN and study ASP.4/ALL is presented below. 
After repeated administration of asparaginase at a dose of 5,000 U/m² every third day, trough 
asparaginase activity levels in serum ranged from 108 to 510 U/l in adult patients. 
In trial MC-ASP.5/ALL, samples of CSF were taken at day 33 of induction treatment - the day of the last 
administration of r-asparaginase or Asparaginase medac. Asparaginase activities in CSF on Day 33 were 
below the lower limit of quantification in nearly all patients. Only three of 176 evaluable samples (two in 
the reference group and one in the r-asparaginase group) contained measurable amounts of 
asparaginase activity on Day 33 of induction treatment.  
Elimination 
Metabolism 
Patel et al. reported that two lysosomal cysteine proteases present in lymphoblasts are able to degrade 
asparaginase. Cathepsin B, which is produced constitutively by normal and leukaemic cells, degraded 
asparaginase produced by Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) 
specifically degraded E. coli-derived asparaginase. The N24 residue on the flexible active loop was 
identified as the primary AEP cleavage site. Sole modification at this site rendered asparaginase resistant

to AEP cleavage and suggested a key role for the flexible active loop in determining asparaginase activity. 
AEP is very variably expressed in children with ALL, with highest activity observed in high risk patients 
(Patel et al. 2009). 
In 7 adult patients in study MC-ASP.2/RHN, the mean ± SD terminal half-life (elimination half-life) of 
asparaginase activity in serum was 25.8 ±  9.9 h, with a range between 14.2 and 44.2 h.  
In 14 children/adolescents in study MC-ASP.4/ALL, the mean ± SD terminal half-life (elimination half-life) 
of asparaginase activity in serum was 17.1 ±  1.2 h, with a range between 12.5 and 22.9 h. 
Excretion 
Asparaginase is thought to be degraded within the reticulo-histiocytic system and/or by endopeptidases 
present in the serum (Patel et al. 2009). Only minimal urinary and biliary excretion of asparaginase was 
found in one published investigation in dogs (Ho et al. 1971). In the studies performed, recombinant 
asparaginase levels were not measured in urine or faeces of patients. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Data are available from a published clinical trial with the reference drug Asparaginase medac. Children 
with de novo ALL were treated with 8 doses of 10,000 U/m² (n = 39 patients), 5,000 U/m²  (n = 15 
patients), or 2,500 U/m² (n = 11 patients) Asparaginase medac during induction treatment. Mean ± SD 
trough asparaginase activity levels were 430 ± 300 U/L, 270 ± 109 U/L, and 125 ± 68 U/L (Ahlke et al. 
1997).  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
A  population  pharmacokinetic  (PopPK)  two-compartment  model  for  recombinant  asparaginase  was 
developed  based  on  asparaginase-activity  levels  in  serum  obtained  in  the  three  clinical  trials 
(MC-ASP.4/ALL, MC-ASP.5/ALL, MC-ASP.6/INF) with recombinant asparaginase in children with de novo 
ALL. These children received recombinant asparaginase at a median dose of 5,000 U/m² (range 4,615 – 
10,000) during induction treatment. Data of the 3 trials were merged in a NONMEM-dataset. The dataset 
included the actual infusion- and sampling-times of 640 serum samples from 124 children. 
The final structural-model was a two-compartment model for recombinant asparaginase (rASNase). Even 
though two physiological distribution areas appeared improbable for rASNase, the superiority of the 
two-compartment-model indicated that two mechanisms with different speeds may be involved in the 
rASNase elimination. In most patients an initial distribution phase with a short elimination half-life of 
about 0.2 hours was apparent. Shortly thereafter, the rASNase-elimination followed simple first-order 
kinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of 17.4 hours.  
The base model was a one-compartment model with interindividual variability estimated on clearance 
(CL) and central volume of distribution (V1) and a combined error model (additive and proportional).  The 
final base structural PK model was a 2-compartment model with IIV estimated on CL and V1 and 
interoccasion variability (IOV) on CL.  Body weight was included as a scaling factor for all structural 
parameters (CL, V1, Q and V2). 
The parameter estimates for the final population PK model for rASNase-activity were provided.  The 
relative standard errors for all estimated PK-parameters were smaller than 22%. 
The plots of the observed and model-predicted rASNase-activities of the individual patients from the trial 
with more intensive sampling (trial 1 (study number MC-ASP.4/ALL) with 16 children between 2 and 14 
years) and trial 3 (study number MCASP. 6/INF) (with sparse sampling in 12 infants between 3 days and 
1 year)) showed that the model can adequately estimate the observed rASNase trough activities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 36/132 
  
  
 
Parameter estimates were: CL 0.202 l/h/70 kg, V1 0.933 l/70 kg, Q 2.87 l/h/70 kg and V2 3.91 l/70 kg. 
The inter-individual and inter-occasion variability of the CL were relatively low with 14.8 % and 6.88 %, 
respectively. In contrast, inter-individual variability of V1 was high (66.6 %), mainly reflecting the 
variability in the peak plasma values (Cmax). 
Residual variability was calculated with a combined error model (additive error 13.5 U/l; proportional 
error 6.07 %). Body weight (WT) was used as scaling factor on the PK-parameters CL and Q (factor 
0.0378) as well as on the V1 and the V2 (factor 0.0450). The comparison of a model with WT as scaling 
factor with a model that included the scaling factor body surface area (BSA) did not show a marked 
model-deterioration. The objective function only increased by one point and IIV of the V1 as well as the 
relative standard errors of the estimated values for the CL, the Q, the V2 and the residual error were 
slightly larger in the model including the BSA than in the model using the WT as scaling factor.  
Influence of demographic covariates on the asparaginase-activity: The model-predicted individual trough 
values showed no correlation with the covariates age, body surface area (BSA), body weight and body 
height (model-predicted individual values more than 43 hours after recombinant asparaginase-infusion). 
There was no significant difference between the trough levels between boys and girls. Patients receiving 
more than 6500 U/m² rASNase had lower trough levels than patients receiving lower doses. Patients 
receiving more than 6500 U/m² rASNase were all infants included in trial 3 (N=12).  
Influence of recombinant asparaginase trough activities on laboratory findings:  The measured serum 
creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, antithrombin III and 
fibrinogen values did not appear to be influenced substantially by the asparaginase-activity trough levels. 
Thus, from this analysis, there were no safety-concerns in this dose-schedule.  
Influence of recombinant asparaginase trough activities on the minimal residual disease status:  Patients 
with a negative and a positive minimal residual disease status had no significantly different asparaginase 
(rASNase)-activity trough levels. 
Influence of laboratory findings on model-predicted parameters: The laboratory findings did not appear to 
influence the model predicted clearance (CL) and the volume of distribution of the central compartment 
(V1; both normalised to the body weight). However, the patients with the three highest serum creatinine 
values had a CL below and the patients with the three highest alanine aminotransferase concentrations 
had a CL above the populations´ median CL (estimated after the first asparaginase (rASNase)-infusion). 
The patients with the three lowest antithrombin III values had a V1 above the populations´ median V1. 
Infants:  The measured rASNase-activities of the infants included in the analysis could adequately be 
estimated with the final NONMEM-model. The infants receiving more than 6500 U/m² rASNase (infants 
included in trial 3), had lower trough activities than patients receiving lower doses. It was noted that 
sampling times for the trough levels were not standardised to a certain hour after administration. It 
should also be noted that the number of 12 infants in the dataset is small. The model predicted a 
significantly (p < 0.05) higher CL and a lower V1 for the infants.  
Comparison with native Escherichia coli asparaginase:  A comparison of the estimated pharmacokinetic 
(PK)-parameters of recombinant asparaginase (rASNase) with the previously published results of an 
analysis for native E. coli asparaginase, showed similar values for the clearance and the terminal 
elimination half-life (17.2 vs. 19.0 h). Lower values for V1 and higher levels for V2 were observed for 
rASNase in comparison to the E. coli asparaginase. However, the shape of the activity vs. time curve 
appeared to be similar to the E. coli asparaginase.  
The large IIV of the V1 and the graphs and the plots, reflected the high variability in the peak plasma 
concentrations. However, the lower IIV in the CL determined a lower variability in the clinically more 
relevant trough concentrations and the time above the threshold activity of 100 U/l (Riccardi et al. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 37/132 
  
  
 
showed in five rhesus monkeys that an activity of 100 U/l was necessary to reach a complete 
asparaginase-depletion in serum and liquor).  
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of asparaginase was studied in 14 children/adolescents (age 2 – 14 years) with de 
novo ALL. The area under the curve of asparaginase activity in serum from 0 to 72 hours (AUC0-72h) after 
first administration of 5,000 U/m² r-L-asparaginase was similar to data obtained in adult patients. Median 
(range) of AUC0-72h was 58,357 (38,627 – 80,764) U per h/l in children versus 59,632 (45,512 – 
78,275) U per h/l in adults. 
Terminal half-life of asparaginase activity in serum was slightly shorter in children than in adults (mean 
± SD: 17.1 ± 1.2 h vs. 25.8 ± 9.9 h). Peak serum asparaginase activity was reached immediately after 
end of infusion in most paediatric patients.  
Median trough serum asparaginase activities were measured in 81 children/adolescents with de novo ALL 
three days after infusion of asparaginase (just before the next dose had to be given) during induction 
treatment and ranged from 168 to 184 U/l (study MC-ASP.5/ALL). 
In study MC-ASP.6/INF, trough serum activity levels were measured in 12 infants (age from birth to 
1 year) with de novo ALL. Median (range) serum trough asparaginase activities on days 18, 25, and 33 
were 209 (42 – 330) U/l, 130 (6 – 424) U/l, and 32 (1 – 129) U/l, respectively. The lower median activity 
level on day 33 compared to the former two measurements was in part due to the fact that this last serum 
sample was taken 4 days after the last infusion of r-L-asparaginase instead of three days on the other 
occasions.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  specific  pharmacokinetic  drug-interaction  studies  with  recombinant  asparaginase  have  been 
submitted.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of asparaginase is the rapid cleavage of the amino acid asparagine 
into aspartic acid and ammonia.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In a clinical trial in children with de novo ALL (study MC-ASP.4/ALL) it was shown that immediately after 
the end of infusion of asparaginase mean asparagine concentrations in serum dropped from the pre-dose 
concentrations of about 40 µM to below the lower limit of quantification of the bioanalytical method (< 0.5 
µM). The mean asparagine concentrations in serum remained below 0.5 µM from immediately after the 
end of first infusion of asparaginase until at least three days after the last infusion. Thereafter, asparagine 
serum levels increased again and returned to normal values within 1 – 3 weeks. 
In addition to asparagine, asparaginase is also able to cleave the amino acid glutamine to glutamic acid 
and ammonia, however with much less efficiency. Clinical trials with asparaginase have shown that 
glutamine levels are only moderately affected with a very high interindividual variability. Immediately 
after the end of infusion of asparaginase, serum levels of glutamine declined by a maximum of 50 % from 
pre-dose levels of about 400 µM but rapidly returned to normal values within a few hours. (see SmPC 
section 5.1).

In clinical trials with asparaginase, trough asparaginase serum activity levels greater than 100 U/l were 
achieved in the majority of patients which nearly always correlated with a complete depletion of 
asparagine in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Even those few patients with trough asparaginase 
serum activity levels of 10 – 100 U/l usually experienced complete asparagine depletion in serum and 
CSF. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No studies were provided. The applicant discussed available data from clinical experience with ASNase 
treatment. 
Corticosteroids 
Corticosteroids and ASNase are known to cause hypofibrinogenaemia. Furthermore, ASNase is known to 
reduce fibrinogen and antithrombin III levels. Concomitant use of corticosteroids and ASNase may 
increase the risk of a change in these coagulation parameters and subsequent thromboembolic events or 
bleeding episodes (Nowak-Göttl et al. 2009).  
The use of dexamethasone instead of prednisone, administered with ASNase (Asparaginase medac), 
significantly reduced the onset of venous thromboembolism in trials of the German ALL-BFM study group 
(Nowak-Göttl et al. 2003). 
A higher risk of thrombosis during induction therapy with asparaginase and prednisone was seen in 
children with a genetic prothrombotic risk factor (factor V G1691A-mutations, prothrombin 
G20210A-variation, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] T677T-genotype, increased 
lipoprotein A, hyperhomocysteinaemia)(see Section 4.4). 
Anticoagulants 
Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and/ or anticoagulants with asparaginase may increase the risk of a 
change in coagulation parameters (see section 4.4).  
Asparaginase and methotrexate 
Inhibition of protein synthesis secondary to the ASNase-induced depletion of ASN has been shown to 
attenuate the cytotoxic effect of MTX which requires cell replication for its antineoplastic activity. This 
antagonism is observed if ASNase is administered prior to or concurrently with MTX. 
Conversely, the antitumour effects of MTX are enhanced when ASNase is administered 24 hours following 
MTX treatment. This regimen has been shown to reduce the gastrointestinal and haematologic effects of 
MTX (Capizzi, 1981). ASNase had no significant effect on MTX polyglutamate accumulation and MTX 
retention when administered after MTX (Sur et al. 1987). Clinically used combination regimens have been 
developed to make use of the potentially synergistic antineoplastic activity of MTX and ASNase (Harris et 
al. 1980; Hudson et al. 1990; Rosen et al. 2003). 
Asparaginase and cytarabine (Ara-C) 
Laboratory in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the efficacy of high-dose Ara-C is reduced by prior 
administration of ASNase. The mechanisms for this pharmacological antagonism may include 
ASNase-induced decreased cellular uptake and incorporation of Ara-C into macromolecules However, 
when ASNase was given after Ara-C a synergistic effect was observed. This synergism was most 
prominent with a treatment interval of about 120 hours, i.e. before the cells recovered from the Ara-C 
effect. ASNase-induced lowering of the cellular pool size of dCTP and consequent enhanced metabolism of 
Ara-C to its active metabolite Ara-CTP as well as down regulation of bcl-2 oncoprotein levels even in the 
absence of p53 are considered as possible mechanisms for this synergistic action (Schwartz et al. 1982; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015

Capizzi and White 1988). The therapeutic benefit of this pharmacological manipulation has been verified 
in several clinical trials in patients with ALL and AML (Harris et al. 1998; Wells et al. 1993). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
As a protein, r-L-asparaginase is not absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. 
Therefore  it  must  be  given  parenterally.  In  all  clinical  trials  both  r-L-asparaginase  and  asparaginase 
medac were administered intravenously (IV). No oral bioavailability study data are therefore available.  
With regard to the possibility of administering Spectrila intramuscularly (IM), no clinical data on Spectrila 
bioavailability after IM administration were provided to support such use. The Applicant refered to a paper 
by  B.  Klug  Albertsen  (British  Journal  of  Haematology,  2001),  comparing  Erwinia  asparaginase  and 
Asparaginase medac, both administered IM. The mean bioavailability after IM administration (27% for 
Erwinia  asparaginase,  and  45%  for  Asparaginase  Medac)  is  significantly  lower  than  after  IV 
administration. To support the IM administration of Spectrila, the Applicant assumed comparable enzyme 
activity  after  the  two  routes  of  administration  (IM  and  IV)  which  is  not  supported  by  the  data. 
Furthermore, efficacy data on the use of IM asparaginase medac cannot be accepted as pivotal support 
for the efficacy of IM Spectrila also considering the differences in formulation and impurities. Thus, no 
recommendation for use of Spectrila intramuscularly can be made at this stage.  
The pharmacokinetics of recombinant asparaginase were evaluated after intravenous infusion of a first 
dose in 14 children in study MC-ASP.4/ALL and 7 adult patients in study MC-ASP.2/RHN. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters in serum and CSF were calculated using non-compartmental procedures. Additionally, trough 
levels  were  evaluated  in  serum  during  induction  treatment  in  studies  MC-ASP.1/ALL,  MC-ASP.5/ALL, 
MC-ASP.6/INF  and  MC-ASP.4/ALL.  Pharmacokinetics  results  are  presented  and  discussed  under  the 
clinical efficacy section. 
The median volume of distribution of Spectrila (2.6 L in adults; 1 L in children) equals the plasma volume, 
suggesting that the drug is distributed mainly in the intravascular space. This likely relates to its large 
molecular size.  
Asparaginase activity in CSF was not detected in almost all patients. This was expected as this large 
protein is not expected to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in measurable amounts.   
In study MC-ASP.5/ALL, 3 of 176 evaluable samples (two in the reference group and one in the 
r-asparaginase group) contained measurable amounts of asparaginase activity in CSF on Day 33 of 
induction treatment. Despite that, ASN depletion in CSF was complete in more than 85% of patients. 
Therefore, ASN depletion by r-asparaginase appears to mainly occur within the intravascular space. Since 
this builds up a concentration gradient between extra- and intravascular space, ASN levels are 
subsequently also reduced in the extravascular spaces, e.g. the cerebrospinal fluid (Schwartz et al. 1970; 
Müller and Boos 1998).  
The  metabolism  of  asparaginase  is  not  known  but  thought  to  occur  via  degradation  within  the 
reticulo-histiocytic  system  and  by  serum  proteases.  Only  minimal  urinary  and  biliary  excretion  of 
asparaginase  was  found  in  one  published  investigation  in  dogs.  No  new  metabolism  studies  were 
therefore,  performed  by  the  Applicant  and  Spectrila  levels  were  not  measured  in  urine  or  faeces  of 
patients. 
Since asparaginase is degraded by plasma enzymes into its constituent amino acids, there are no active 
metabolites.

No  dose  ranging  studies  were  submitted  by  the  Applicant  investigating  PK  dose  linearity.  However, 
published clinical trials suggest that asparaginase trough serum activities are linear over the dose range 
2,500 to 10,000 U/m². A trough serum asparaginase activity level of greater than 100 U/L is generally 
considered to guarantee complete ASN depletion in serum and CSF. The majority of trough asparaginase 
activity levels in the combined pivotal and PK trials after repeated administration ranged from 120 – 200 
U/L. PK data regarding maintenance of asparaginase level above 100 U/L have also been provided and are 
discussed under the clinical efficacy discussion (see also discussion on clinical efficacy).    
A  population  pharmacokinetic  (PopPK)  two-compartment  model  for  recombinant  asparaginase  was 
developed. The Applicant acknowledged the limitations of performed analyses which were mainly due to 
the  availability  of  only  few  data  from  infants  and  to  the  fact  that  no  external  evaluation  of  the  final 
NONMEM-model  was  performed  due  to  a  lack  of  an  external  dataset.  The  model  indicated  an  initial 
distribution phase with a short elimination half-live of about 0.2 hours, and a second elimination phase by 
first-order  kinetics  with  a  terminal  elimination  half-live  of  17.4  hours.  Variability  in  the  clearance 
estimates  was  relatively  low,  whereas  inter-individual  variability  was  significantly  high  (66%)  for  the 
estimates of central volume of distribution. This was somewhat expected given the known variability in 
the peak plasma values (Cmax).  
The PopPK model showed a clear correlation between the clearance of recombinant asparaginase and 
body surface area (BSA), thus supporting the adequacy of dosing based on BSA. Using this PopPK model, 
the influence of covariates such as age, BSA, body weight, and body height on the trough asparaginase 
serum  activities  was  investigated.  Neither  correlation  with  these  covariates  nor  significant  difference 
between the trough asparaginase serum activities of boys and girls was found. The model was also used 
to  study  the  influence  of  trough  asparaginase  serum  activities  on  status  of  minimal  residual  disease 
(MRD) at the end of induction treatment. Also in this case no correlation was found.  
The measured serum creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
antithrombin  III  and  fibrinogen  values  did  not  appear  to  be  influenced  substantially  by  the 
asparaginase-activity  trough  levels.  Thus,  from  this  analysis,  there  are  no  safety-concerns  in  this 
dose-schedule. 
The small number of patients (n=12) receiving a dose of more than 6500 U/m² recombinant asparaginase 
had lower trough activities than patients receiving lower doses. It is notable that the patients receiving 
more than 6500 U/m² recombinant asparaginase were all infants (from the infant trial). This finding must 
be interpreted with caution, because sampling times for the trough levels were not standardised to a 
certain hour after administration. The model predicted a significantly (p < 0.05) higher CL and a lower V1 
for  the infants.  The  higher  CL  in  infants  is not  surprising  as  the  parameter  was  standardised  to  body 
weight and infants often show a higher clearance per kg than older children. The difference in the CL 
standardised to BSA was statistically significant but small and does not appear to be of clinical relevance. 
Therefore, from the PK point of view, there is currently no sufficient evidence to change the proposed 
dose in infants. The recommended dose in infants is 6,700 U/m² BSA in patients aged less than 6 months 
and 7,500 U/m² BSA in patients aged 6 – 12 months based on study MC-ASP.6/INF. 
The Applicant did not perform any PK studies in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. Results from 
the  PopPK  analysis  did  not  highlight  any  correlation  between  exposure  to  the  two  asparaginase 
formulations and serum creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
antithrombin III and fibrinogen covariates. 
No new PK drug interaction studies have been conducted with Spectrila. No studies on induction/inhibition 
of  drug-metabolising  enzymes  were  performed.  Well-established  potential/identified  interactions  with 
medicinal products that are administered concurrently in multi-drug treatment protocols for the target 
indications  are  further  discussed  below  and  adequately  reported  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC.  This 
Assessment report

approach  is  considered  sufficient  to  justify  the  lack  of  new  specific  PK  drug-interaction  studies  with 
asparaginase. 
In view of the limited PK data in adults, the applicant will undertake further study of PK, PD and safety of 
Spectrila in adults post-approval (see RMP). 
Pharmacodynamics 
Since pharmacodynamic data using asparagine as a surrogate marker of efficacy were submitted as 
pivotal evidence of efficacy, these data are presented and discussed under the section on clinical efficacy. 
With regards to pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products, the toxicity of vincristine 
may be additive with that of asparaginase if both agents are administered concomitantly. Therefore, 
vincristine should be given 3 to 24 hours before administration of r L asparaginase in order to minimise 
toxicity (see SmPC section 4.5). Within trial MC-ASP.5/ALL vincristine was given together with 
asparaginase on day 15 but no allergic reactions were observed on that day (see clinical safety). Potential 
interaction of vincristine and ASNase is adequately addressed in the RMP. 
Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and/ or anticoagulants with asparaginase may increase the risk of a 
change in coagulation parameters (see section 4.4). This can promote tendency to bleeding 
(anticoagulants) or thrombosis (glucocorticoids). Caution is therefore needed when anticoagulants (e.g. 
coumarin, heparin, dipyridamole, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal 
products) or glucocorticoids are given at the same time (see SmPC section 4.5)..  
Interactions with glucocorticoids (altered coagulation and increased risk of osteonecrosis) are adequately 
addressed in the risk management plan. Potential interactions with anticoagulants will also be closely 
monitored as important potential risks. 
Inhibition of protein synthesis secondary to the asparaginase-induced depletion of asparagine has been 
shown to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of MTX which requires cell replication for its antineoplastic activity. 
This antagonism is observed if asparaginase is administered prior to or concurrently with methotrexate. 
Conversely, the antitumour effects of methotrexate are enhanced when asparaginase is administered 24 
hours following methotrexate treatment. This regimen has been shown to reduce the gastrointestinal and 
haematological effects of methotrexate. (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Laboratory in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the efficacy of high-dose cytarabine is reduced by prior 
administration of asparaginase. However, when asparaginase was given after cytarabine a synergistic 
effect was observed. This effect was most prominent with a treatment interval of about 120 hours  (see 
SmPC section 4.5). 
Schedule-dependent interactions with methotrexate and with Ara-C as well are adequately addressed in 
the RMP. 
Asparaginase may increase the toxicity of other medicinal products through its effect on liver function, 
e.g. increased hepatotoxicity with potentially hepatotoxic medicines, increased toxicity of medicinal 
products metabolised by the liver or bound to plasma proteins and altered pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of medicines bound to plasma proteins (see SmPC section 4.5). Potential interaction 
with other medicines where impaired liver metabolism could increase toxicity are covered in the RMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data are considered sufficient and have been adequately reflected in the 
product information.

Induction treatment section (PROTOCOL I [A and B]) of protocol DCOG ALL 10 
Patients received their study drug infusions on days 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33.  
For  the  post-induction  treatment,  all  patients  were  stratified  into  three  risk  groups  (standard  risk, 
medium risk, high risk [SR, MR, HR]) based on stratification criteria defined in the DCOG ALL 10 protocol. 
Pegaspargase (Oncaspar) was given to patients in the standard risk (SR) (one infusion of 2500 U/m² 
only) and medium risk (MR) (15 infusions of 2500 U/m² pegaspargase in Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 
17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 of the intensification phase of the DCOG ALL 10) groups. High risk (HR) 
patients received four infusions of 10000 U/m² of the same asparaginase product as during induction 
treatment (on Days 22, 25, 29 and 32 of high risk blocks 1, 2, 4 and 5 and on Days 8, 11, 15 and 18 of 
protocol  II,  both  of  the  DCOG  ALL  10  protocol).  Several  chemotherapy  agents  were  administered 
concomitantly throughout, as detailed in the DCOG ALL 10 protocol. 
Objectives 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of recombinant L-asparaginase to asparaginase medac with regard to 
complete depletion of serum asparagine (i.e. to show pharmacodynamic equivalence of both 
preparations). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:

include silent inactivation of asparaginase activity, defined as asparaginase serum activity <20 U/L 3 days 
after administration of asparaginase to high risk patients 
- incidence of pre-defined asparaginase-related AEs and overall AEs. These include; allergic reactions/

- CR rate and MRD status after induction treatment phase A 
- Relapse rate, relapse-free survival (RFS) and EFS at end of study. ‘Events’ were relapse, death or 
premature termination of the protocol DCOG ALL 10. ‘Relapse’ was the recurrence of leukaemia after CR 
had been documented.  
- number of patients in each risk group (standard risk, medium risk, high risk [SR, MR, HR]) who could 
complete their full course of asparaginase treatment as scheduled. 
Analytical methods 
Asparaginase activity in various body fluids (plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) 
Asparaginase activity was determined with a sensitive microplate reader-based method (AHA-assay).  
CRS performed three ASNase evaluations of samples collected in clinical study MC-ASP.5/ALL: 
−  Original  Method:  ASNase  values  derived  by  applying  the  “Standard  evaluation  method  plus  an 
additional  best  curve  fit  evaluation”  (SEM+BCF)  as  already  applied  in  the  original  routine  evaluation 
(referred to as original data) 
− Method I: ASNase values derived by applying the strict “Standard evaluation method” (SEM) (dated: 
04-Aug-2015). 
−  Method  II:  Inspection-induced  re-evaluated  and  quality-controlled  ASNase  values  applying  the 
“Standard evaluation method plus an additional best curve fit evaluation” (SEM+BCF) as already applied 
in the Original Method evaluation (dated: 17-Oct-2014). 
Amino acids asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid (plasma, serum, CSF) 
The amino acids asparagine (ASN), aspartic acid (ASP), glutamine (GLN), and glutamic acid (GLU) are 
known to be influenced by asparaginase treatment and were therefore determined in serum or plasma 
and CSF. To avoid ex vivo cleavage of ASN by asparaginase, blood samples were processed according to 
a  specific  procedure.  Within  this  procedure,  the  whole  blood  collected  in  vials  without  additive  were 
immediately  placed  in  an  ice  water  bath  and  rapidly  transferred  to  the  laboratory  where  it  was 
immediately  centrifuged  (600-800  G  for  10  minutes).  Serum  and  CSF  samples  for  amino  acid

determination were then deproteinised with 10% sulphosalicylic acid. Amino acid levels were measured 
using a liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection.  
Anti-drug antibodies 
The  assay  is  an  indirect  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  using  the  drugs  (Asparaginase 
medac  or  recombinant  asparaginase) 
immobilised  to  the  solid  phase.  The  assay  detects 
anti-asparaginase antibodies of the classes IgG and IgM simultaneously. ADAs in serum were determined 
at  all  time  points  during  induction  and  post-induction  treatment  where  blood  sample  collection  was 
performed.  For statistical analysis a blood sample was considered as anti-asparaginase antibody positive 
if at least one of both concentrations was 6.25 AU/mL or above. Otherwise, anti-asparaginase antibody 
tests were classified as negative. 
Sample size 
On the basis of published data on native asparaginase and the first results with recombinant asparaginase 
it was assumed that the success rate would be roughly 95% in the reference and experimental arms. In 
order to demonstrate statistically significant non-inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of -10% at a 
one-sided type I error of 2.5%, n = 94 patients per group were required within the Per Protocol Set to 
yield a power of 80% using the unconditional exact test statistic as outlined in the protocol. Assuming that 
5% of the randomised patients did not qualify for the Per Protocol Set, 198 patients were to be enrolled 
for efficacy analysis. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a ratio of 1:1 with a randomisation stratified by centre using permuted 
blocks. The centre served as the stratification variable. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double-blind clinical study. The investigators were blinded. However, the pharmacists 
were not, as they prepared the investigational products (IP) for administration to the patients. For 
high-risk patients in the post-induction phase, L-asparaginase treatment was also blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The confirmatory objective was to show that recombinant L-asparaginase is non-inferior to asparaginase 
medac with respect to the asparaginase-induced complete ASN depletion rate (cDR) in serum during the 
induction phase.  The non-inferiority margin ‘D’ was pre-specified at -10 percentage points, i.e. a loss of 
Δ=-10  percentage  points  on  the  absolute  scale  has  been  decided  to  represent  a  clinically  relevant 
difference (inferiority) to be excluded by the evidence resulting from this trial. Having shown significant 
non-inferiority with respect to the primary efficacy parameter, a supplementary hypothesis system aimed 
to investigate further any potential significant clinical benefit with respect to hypersensitivity reactions 
(HSR) using a hierarchical approach. 
Analysis Populations 
-  Safety Analysis Set included all randomised patients who received the IP at least once.  
- 
- 
Full Analysis Set included all randomised patients analysed according to ITT principles.  
Per Protocol Set consisted of all patients in the Full Analysis Set analysed in their actual treatment 
group, if IP was given and ASN serum levels were evaluable for at least three scheduled time points 
during induction phase.  
Confirmatory statistical analysis of the primary efficacy parameter was performed within the Per Protocol 
Set and Full Analysis Set. Safety analyses were performed within the Safety Analysis Set.

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the unconditional exact test of non-inferiority for binomial differences 
based on restricted maximum likelihood estimates was applied. Statistical significance was claimed if the 
resulting p-value was less than the pre-specified significance level of 0.025. A two-sided 95% CI for the 
difference between complete ASN depletion rates (the rate for the recombinant asparaginase group 
minus the rate for the asparaginase medac group) was provided using the method by Chan and Zhang. 
Recombinant asparaginase was to be deemed to be not less effective than asparaginase medac if the 
lower limit of this CI was greater than -10%.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Deviations 
Of the 199 patients included in this clinical study (Full Analysis Set), 59 patients (29.6%) showed major 
protocol deviations. Of these, 26 (25.7%) patients received Asparaginase medac (33.7%) and 33 
patients received recombinant L-asparaginase. Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria at study entry 
occurred in 11 patients (5.5%), six patients receiving Asparaginase medac and five patients receiving 
recombinant L-asparaginase. Ten patients violated inclusion criterion no. 2. Other major deviations 
include missing evaluations for serum samples, time schedule deviations and treatment deviations (e.g. 
study drug not being administered). 
Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
The  two  treatment  groups  were  comparable  regarding  the  demographic  data.  The  trial  enrolled  an

activity in serum during induction phase stratified by age group – Per protocol set (study 
MC-ASP.5/ALL) 
Following the request of recalculating asparaginase data derived using the “standard evaluation method” 
(i.e. without using an additional best curve fit evaluation), the results of three different evaluation 
methods (including the original method) were reported and are presented below.  
The number of non-valid samples was considerably increased when applying the more stringent Method 
I, compared to both the original Method and Method II. In total, the percentage of patients providing a 
complete set of ASNase values after start of ASNase-infusion is 87.9%, 87.9% and 73.4% when 
respectively applying the Original Method, Method II and the more stringent Method I. One third of the 
number of non-valid samples (n=59) produced with Method I occurred on Day 12 prior to infusion of any 
ASNase preparation (baseline). Considering only those samples providing valid results, the median 
differences in ASNase activity values in serum as well as the quartiles and 5% and 95% quantiles equalled 
zero between Method II and Method I. Between the data of the Original Method and the re-evaluated data 
according to Method II, the median differences as well as the quartiles were zero. Similar results were 
observed for the comparison between the data of Method I and the Original Method.  However, when the 
means are taken into consideration, differences between initial and method I data were larger than those 
reported among initial and method II data.  
The ASNase activity data obtained with method I of re-evaluation are presented below.

Median  concentrations  of  ASP  in  serum  at  baseline  and  before  administrations  of  IP  during  induction 
phase were comparable between treatment groups. Median ASP levels increased about four- to six-fold 
compared to baseline levels and were still four-fold above baseline on Day 33. 
Figure 6: Plot of Arithmetic Mean and 95% CI of Glutamine in Serum during Induction Phase -

Mean concentrations of GLN in serum at baseline were comparable between treatment groups. They 
declined only slightly from pre-dose levels of 421 μmoL/L to 374 μmoL/L on Day 15 and 369 μmoL/L on 
Day 21, but returned to 416 μmoL/L on Day 27 and 409 μmoL/L on Day 33. Whereas ASN is completely 
depleted in serum in the majority of patients, GLN serum level are only marginally and temporarily 
influenced by asparaginase treatment. Nevertheless, a continuous turnover of GLN takes place during 
asparaginase treatment as reflected by the increase of the cleavage product GLU.

The median asparaginase activity in CSF on Days 1 and 33 was below Lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) 
in both treatment groups. Only three samples (two in the reference group and one in the recombinant 
asparaginase  group)  contained  measurable  amounts  (>LLoQ)  of  asparaginase  activity  on  Day  33  of 
induction treatment. This confirms results of other study groups that this protein is not able to cross the 
blood-brain barrier in measurable amounts. 
Concentrations  of  Aspartic  Acid,  Glutamine  and  Glutamic  Acid  in  Cerebrospinal  Fluid  during  Induction 
Phase 
The median concentrations of ASP and GLU in CSF were below LLoQ on Days 1 and 33 of induction phase 
in  both  treatment  groups.  Mean  estimates  however  showed  similar  and  small  reductions  in  GLU 
concentrations  in  each  arm  but  little  if  any  change  in  ASP  concentrations.  The  mean  and  median 
concentrations of GLN in CSF changed little during induction and were comparable between treatment 
groups.

During post-induction, blood sampling for the determination of asparaginase activity was performed on 
Day 1 and Day 8 of protocol IV for SR patients and on Day 1 and Day 15 of the intensification phase for 
MR patients. For HR patients, blood sampling was performed on Day 22, Day 25 and Day 32 of HR blocks 
1, 2, 4 and 5 as well as on Day 8, 11 and 18 of protocol II.

Similar  to  induction  treatment,  ASP  levels  rose  during  treatment  with  study  drug  due  to  continuous 
cleavage of ASN. 
With regard to evaluation of glutamine concentrations in serum during the post-induction phase, slightly 
larger  decreases  were  seen  in  patients  administered  recombinant  asparaginase  than  patients 
administered asparaginase medac in HR Blocks 1 and 2). This pattern was also repeated, with respect to 
increases in glutamic acid serum concentrations. 
Complete Remission Rate and Minimal Residual Disease Status after Induction Phase 
The assessment of CR rate and MRD status was performed after induction treatment, i.e. Day 33 or later 
if  bone  marrow  was  not  evaluable  on  Day  33.  Rates  of  CR  and  MRD  status  after  induction  were 
comparable in both treatment groups. In each of the treatment groups two patients (2.0%) were not in 
CR. The MRD status after induction phase was negative in 32 patients (31.7%) in the asparaginase medac 
group and in 29 patients (29.6%) in the recombinant asparaginase group.

Cumulative incidence of Relapse, Relapse Free Survival and Event-Free Survival 
For the evaluation of cumulative incidence of relapse, RFS and EFS patients were followed up every 12 
months  ±  2  weeks  after  randomisation  until  disease  recurrence,  death  or  until  the  end  of  the  study. 
Patients  who  discontinued  treatment  according  to  protocol  DCOG  ALL  10  and  patients  who  received 
allogenic bone marrow transplantation were not followed up. The median time of follow up was 12 months 
in both treatment groups. 
No relapses occurred during this time in either treatment group. Relapse-free survival was defined as the 
probability  of  being  alive with no indication  of  relapse.  Since  no  relapses  were  documented,  RFS  was 
exclusively driven by the four deaths that occurred. 
Event-free  survival  was  defined  as  the  time  span  between  date  of  randomisation  and  date  of  death, 
relapse or premature termination of DCOG ALL 10 protocol - whichever occurred first. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimates for RFS and EFS in the asparaginase medac and recombinant asparaginase 
groups are described below.

ASN concentrations vs. of ASNase activity 
A scatter diagram was also created showing the ASNase activity levels versus ASN concentrations to 
assess the relevance of ASNase activity as a biomarker for predicting ASN depletion. Associated 
Bravais-Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to judge the strength of the 
correlations. The fundamental unit of this analysis is the individual blood sample.

Supportive studies 
STUDY MC-ASP.4/ALL 
This was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group phase II clinical trial. The first subject 
was enrolled on 4 January 2005 and the last subject completed the study on 17 October 2006. 
Study objectives 
- to compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of recombinant ASNase 
versus Asparaginase medac during induction treatment in children with de novo ALL. 
- to demonstrate that any clinically important difference to the disadvantage of recombinant ASNase is 
unlikely 
Primary endpoint 
• 
Ratio (recombinant L-asparaginase / Asparaginase medac) of the population geometric means of the 
72 hours (h) serum concentration (L-asparaginase serum activities) versus time curves (AUC0-72) for 
the first administration of recombinant L-asparaginase and Asparaginase medac. 
This was calculated by the log-linear trapezoidal method, i.e., the linear trapezoidal rule is applied up to 
tmax  and  then  the  log  trapezoidal  rule  is  applied  for  the  remainder  of  the  curve.  Analysis  of  variance

procedures were applied for the confirmatory analysis of the AUC parameter. A 90% confidence interval 
for the difference in the log-transformed AUCs was calculated using the total between-subject variance. 
The antilogs of this confidence interval were used to check whether this interval was contained within the 
predefined equivalence limit of 0.75 and 1.33. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Cmax, Tmax (if multiple maxima are observed in the curve, tmax is assigned to the first maximum), λz 
(terminal elimination rate constant), t1/2λz (terminal elimination half-life); results from the statistical 
analysis of Cmax were not considered for the decision on bioequivalence

Study design 
This  study  was  conducted  in  a  single  centre  in  Rotterdam,  Netherlands.  A  total  of  32  patients  were 
randomised to ensure that 30 would qualify for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. 
The  study  was  embedded  in  the  treatment  protocol  DCOG  ALL-10  and  conducted  within  a  treatment 
period of about 4 weeks (see previous trial). 
All patients received a combination chemotherapy according to the DCOG ALL-10 protocol including 8 
infusions  of  either  recombinant  L-asparaginase  or  Asparaginase  medac  during  phase  A  of  induction 
treatment.  Starting  with  the  first  L-asparaginase  infusion  on  day  12,  the  patients  received  study 
medication every third day, ending with the eighth infusion on Day 33. 
This study required the following dose of L-asparaginase during induction treatment to be administered: 
5,000 U/m²; in case of appearance of any allergic reaction, treatment with asparaginase preparations 
had to be stopped. Within the trial, the study medication (recombinant L-asparaginase or Asparaginase 
medac)  was  only  used  during  induction  treatment.  Patients  were  treated  post-induction  with 
pegaspargase.

Main Exclusion criteria 
•  General health status according to Karnofsky / Lansky score < 40% 
•

• 
Pre-existing coagulopathy (e.g. haemophilia) 
Patients with known genetic prothrombotic risk factors

•  Other current malignancies 
Statistical plan 
The confirmative objective of this trial is to show that the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the 
population geometric means of the 72 h asparaginase serum concentration versus time curves (AUC0-72h) 
for  the  first  administration  of  recombinant  asparaginase  (test  product)  and  Asparaginase  medac 
(reference product) is within the equivalence limit 0.75 to 1.33. This wider acceptance range was chosen 
due to the following reasons: substantial variance of the relative bioavailability (parallel group design, 
paediatric  patients);  wide  therapeutic  range  of  asparaginase  treatment;  no  safety  and/or  efficacy 
concerns; paediatric patient population (age ≥1 year up to ≤18 years). 
Analysis populations 
- 
- 
ITT  population  -  Patients  randomised  into  the  study  who  had  received  at  least  one  asparaginase 
infusion. This was used for the safety analysis. 
PK population - All patients who had been administered the first dose of the study medication and had 
completed the study up to Day 15 according to the study protocol without serious deviations (i.e. at 
least 50% missing samples per asparaginase concentration profile in the 0-72 h interval, significant 
deviation from scheduled time). 
- 
Per protocol population - All patients who had been administered the first seven doses of the study 
medication  and  had  completed  the  study  up  to  Day  33  before  administration  of  the  eighth  dose 
without serious deviations which might have influenced the ASN concentrations in serum and CSF.  
Results 
Disposition of patients 
Altogether 32 children with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia participated in the study. 
One patient discontinued due to a SAE (viral hepatitis) after 7 of 8 scheduled infusions. All other patients 
completed  the  entire  course  of  treatment.  All  enrolled  patients  were  included  in  the  ITT  and  PP 
populations. However, 2 patients were excluded from the PK population.

Table 28: Disease status (ITT population) (Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
WBC counts in peripheral blood ranged from 0.6 to 227×109 WBC/L, and one patient had an extreme 
value of 578 ×109 WBC/L, with up to 96% peripheral blasts.  
Pharmacokinetic results  
All subjects receiving test or reference treatment exhibited measurable asparaginase serum activities. 
Immediately  after  infusion,  geometric  mean  asparaginase  serum  activity  was  3231.19  U/L  following 
recombinant asparaginase infusion and 3303.04 U/L following Asparaginase medac treatment. After 72h, 
the geometric mean asparaginase serum activity was 123.18 U/L following recombinant asparaginase 
infusion and 174.96 U/L following Asparaginase medac treatment. Geometric mean serum activity vs. 
time profiles up to 72 h following administration of the first eight doses is shown below (lin-lin scale). 
Figure 12: Serum asparaginase activity vs. time [h] following the first of the eight infusions - 
Geometric means (PK population) (Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
The geometric mean of AUC0-72h was 58356.9 U*h/L following recombinant asparaginase infusion and 
67846.4 U*h/L following Asparaginase medac treatment. For tmax, medians of both treatments were zero 
indicating that Cmax was reached immediately after infusion for most patients.

Table 29: Pharmacokinetic parameters of serum activities of asparaginase (PK population) 
(Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  and  90%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  of  log-transformed  pharmacokinetic 
parameters were calculated for serum activities of asparaginase. The point estimate of AUC0-72h for the 
treatment  ratio  test/reference  was  86.01  (90%  CI:  77.52-95.43),  for  Cmax  91.91  (90%  CI: 
82.08-102.91), for t1/2λz 91.01 (90% CI: 80.78-102.54), and for λz 109.88 (90% CI: 97.53-123.79). For 
AUC0-72h,  the  treatment  comparison  showed  that  the  90%  CI  was  contained  within  the  widened 
acceptance range for equivalence of 75% to 133%. Nevertheless a significant difference between the two 
treatments (p=0.020) was observed. No significant difference between the two treatments was obtained 
for Cmax (p=0.215), t1/2λz and its equivalent λz (p=0.190 for both).

Figure 13: Serum asparaginase activity [U/L], pre-dose and subsequent days Geometric 
means (PK population) (Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
Most individual asparaginase activities after Day 39 (i.e., Days 45, 52, 59, and 64), were below the lower 
limit  of  quantitation  (LLoQ)  and  therefore  means  were  not  calculated  and  displayed.  The  observed 
average  trough  activities  under  the  recombinant  L-asparaginase  treatment  were  lower  than  those 
observed  under  the  Asparaginase  medac  treatment.  However,  trough  levels  were  above  the  desired 
threshold of >100 U/L in both groups. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Asparagine concentrations 
Mean asparagine serum concentrations dropped after the first infusion from the pre-dose concentrations 
of  41.83  μmoL/L  (test)  and  42.52  μmoL/L  (reference)  to  below  LLoQ  (BLLQ)  of  0.5  μmoL/L  of  the 
bioanalytical method under both treatments until Day 33, thereafter, asparagine concentrations in serum 
increased again.

Figure 15: Asparagine concentration in CSF [μmol/L]. Arithmetic means and standard errors 
(Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
In  CSF,  the  mean  asparagine  concentrations  dropped  from  3.71  μmoL/L  (test)  and  3.26  μmoL/L 
(reference)  to  <LLoQ  under  both  treatments  on  Day  15  and  Day  33.  The  mean  asparagine  depletion 
relative to baseline was 91.95% (test) and 90.99% (reference) on Day 15 and 92.92% and 91.28%, 
respectively, on Day 33. 
Aspartic acid concentrations 
During both asparaginase treatments, aspartic acid concentrations in serum increased. 
Figure 16: Aspartic acid [μmoL/L] serum concentrations. Arithmetic means (SE) (Study 
MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
In CSF, only three out of 32 patients had measurable CSF concentrations for aspartic acid. These patients 
were under reference treatment.  
Glutamine concentrations 
Arithmetic mean glutamine serum concentrations decreased under both treatments on Day 15 and Day 
18;  from  Day  21  up  to  day  33  concentrations  increased  following  the  recombinant  L-asparaginase 
treatment and decreased following the Asparaginase medac treatment.

Figure 17: Glutamine serum concentrations [μmoL/L]. Arithmetic means (SE) (Study 
MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
Mean  glutamine  CSF  concentration  showed  slight  increases  following  the  recombinant  L-asparaginase 
treatment and rather decreased following the Asparaginase medac treatment.  
Glutamic acid concentrations 
Arithmetic  mean  glutamic  acid  serum  concentrations  increased  after  first  infusion  from  pre-dose 
concentration  of  38.94  μmoL/L  (test)  and  47.99  μmoL/L  (reference)  to  153.19  μmoL/L  and  170.95 
μmoL/L  respectively.  Thereafter,  glutamic  acid  concentrations  in  serum  decreased  under  both 
treatments. 
Figure 18: Glutamic acid serum concentration [μmoL/L]. Arithmetic means (SE) (Study 
MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
Mean glutamic acid CSF concentrations increased under both treatments versus baseline and remained 
increased  after  treatment  under  recombinant  L-asparaginase  but  returned  to  baseline  under  the 
asparaginase medac.

Duration of ASN depletion in serum 
The mean ± SD duration of ASN depletion in serum after last dose of ASNase was 7.58 ± 3.15 days under 
the rASNase treatment (n = 12) and 9.00 ± 3.46 days under the ASNase medac treatment (n = 11), the 
log-rank test did not show a significant difference (p = 0.2111). Respective medians for this parameter 
were 6.5 days versus 7 days. Individual ASN recovery curves differed substantially in both groups.  
Looking on the number of patients with complete ASN depletion after ASNase treatment shows that all 
patients with samples at day 39 (6 days after last ASNase dose) except one in the rASNase group were 
still completely depleted whereas at day 45 only 3 and 4 patients were still completely depleted in the 
rASNase and ASNase medac group, respectively. All patients in both groups had reached normal ASN 
values at day 52. 
The number and proportion of patients with ASNase activities > 100 U/L after end of induction treatment.

Time to recovery was defined as time to reach ASN values within reference range. In particular, based on 
MC-ASP.5/ALL (used because of the larger sample size; n = 197), recovery of ASN was defined as having 
reached the lower bound of the asymptotic 95% prediction interval, calculated as mean minus 2 x SD, i.e. 
44.04 - 2 x 10.74 = 22.56 µM.

CR rate, MRD rate and responder rates 
Efficacy of the treatments was determined by evaluating the CR rate and MRD rate, responder rates of the 
patients with respect to ASN depletion and duration of the depletion response. 
There  were  less  than  5%  leukaemic  blasts  in  bone  marrow  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  mean 
percentage  of  leukaemic  blasts  in  bone  marrow  was  1.18%  for  the  patients  receiving  recombinant 
L-asparaginase  and  0.55%  for  the  patients  receiving  Asparaginase  medac.  No  leukaemic  blasts  were 
observed in peripheral blood. In CSF, in 1 of 16 patients receiving recombinant L-asparaginase treatment, 
leukaemic blasts were observed, and in 1 of the 16 patients receiving Asparaginase medac treatment, the 
status was not determined. None of the patients in either group showed other extramedullary leukaemia 
manifestations,  and  all  had  regained  haematopoiesis.  Except  for  one  patient,  all  patients  showed 
complete remission.

All  patients  responded  to  the  treatment  on  Day  15  to  33,  showing  an  at  least  95%  depletion  of  ASN 
compared  to  the  initial  value  in  serum  for  the  respective  treatment  day,  although  a  small  number  of 
samples  in  both  treatment  arms  (in  both  serum  and  CSF  analyses)  were  missing  and  could  not  be 
included in the analysis. 
Table 37: Descriptive statistics of responder status defined by ASN (serum depletion at least

For duration of ASN depletion in serum after the last asparaginase administration, 3 patients under 
recombinant L-asparaginase and 4 under Asparaginase medac treatment had a depletion with a duration

of more than 9 days. 3 patients treated with recombinant L-asparaginase and 4 treated with Asparaginase 
medac had missing samples on Day 39 so duration of the depletion could not be determined. 
Table 38: Descriptive statistics and log-rank test for duration (days) of ASN depletion in 
serum after the last administration – ITT population / PP population (Study MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
The exploratory comparisons did not show significant differences between the two treatments for the 
responder  rates  of  patients  with  respect to  ASN  depletion  in  serum  (at  least  95%  compared  to  initial 
value) and CSF (percentage of patients with ASN < LLoQ) for each day (Days 15 to 33). 
Correlation of Asparagine in serum with asparaginase activity 
The asparagine concentrations in serum correlated significantly (Spearman r = -0.7084 for test and r = 
-0.6813 for reference; p<0.0001) to asparaginase serum concentrations under both treatments, that is, 
the higher the concentrations of asparaginase, the lower the asparagine concentrations. 
The mixed model analysis of asparagine depletion in serum from Day 15 to Day 33 showed least square 
(LS)  means  for  the  recombinant  asparaginase  treatment  of  99.38  (μT)  and  of  99.40  (μR)  for  the 
Asparaginase  medac  treatment.  The  lower  limits  of  the  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  for  the 
treatment  difference  (μT-  μR)  derived  from  the  mixed  model  is  -0.0243  (absolute)  and  -0.0244 
(expressed in % of the LS mean of the reference). Non-inferiority of recombinant asparaginase (Test) in 
comparison to Asparaginase medac (Reference) with respect to ASN depletion in serum from Day 15 to 33 
was concluded as the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference 
(μT-μR) derived from the mixed model is above the corresponding Δ (−0.2 μR). 
ANOVA of ASN depletion in CSF was not done because nearly all values on Days 15 and 33 were below the 
LLoQ. 
Asparaginase  treatment  significantly  correlated  with  asparagine  depletion  in  serum  under  both 
treatments. The non-inferiority of asparagine depletion under the recombinant asparaginase treatment 
compared to Asparaginase medac treatment was shown with the upper 95% confidence limit in % of LS 
means of reference exceeding Δ = -20.

Overall Study Design 
The study was open labelled, non-randomised, non-controlled. 
A sample size of 14 adult patients with relapsed/therapy-refractory or indolent haematological neoplasias 
(AML, MDS, NHL) was planned for assignment to treatment with the investigational medicinal product 
(IMP). The total duration of treatment was planned to be 36 days at the most for an individual patient. 
All patients were to receive up to a maximum of 8 recombinant L-asparaginase infusions. The patients 
received study medication every third day, ending with the eighth infusion on day 22 at the latest (i.e. 
treatment days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22). Recombinant L-asparaginase was administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 5,000 U/m² (calculated by the treating physician). 
During  and  up  to  7  days  after  treatment  with  recombinant  asparaginase,  the  administration  of  other 
antineoplastic  agents  was  not  permitted  to  avoid  possible  drug  interactions;  although  there  were  no 
restrictions concerning prior therapy, diet or other supportive medication. 
The administration interval and dosing of recombinant L-asparaginase was based on that of the older 
medac  product.  The  dose  selected  was  that  used  in  the  induction  phase  of  current  paediatric  ALL 
treatment  where  native  L-asparaginase  preparations  are  scheduled.  In  contrast  to  the  current  ALL 
treatment  protocols,  L-asparaginase  was  administered  as  monotherapy  in  this  pilot  study.  Dosage 
modifications were not necessary and not allowed. The principal investigator decided case by case about 
the number of L-asparaginase doses each patient received.

Pharmacokinetic measurements 
Blood samples for PK measurements were collected at specific pre-defined time points before start (-½ h) 
and after end of the first infusion (0, ¼, ½, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 30, 48, 54, and 72 h), as well as always 
immediately before subsequent recombinant L-asparaginase doses, and 14 days after the last infusion 
had been administered. 
From  the  L-asparaginase  activities  measured  in  plasma  after  the  first  infusion,  at  least  the  following 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  determined  using  the  actual  blood  sampling  times  for  calculation 
within a non-compartmental model:

the terminal rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis from a range of concentrations, 
which by inspection appear to be on a straight line in the logarithmic-linear plot 
Results 
Patient disposition 
The trial was prematurely discontinued in November 2005 due to non-compliance with the time schedule 
as only 8 of the 14 planned patients were enrolled in 23 months instead of the projected 6 months. The 
first patient never received therapy with the study drug because of thrombocytopenia after registration. 
None of the other seven patients was treated with the full course of maximum 8 doses (varied between 1 
and 5 infusions); 4 had treatment discontinued due to low anti-thrombin III levels because of risk of 
development of thromboembolic complications.  Due to the palliative character of the study, there was 
reluctance to accept decreased AT III levels to the magnitude of what is generally tolerated when treating 
patients with curative intent. 
Analysis of pharmacokinetics 
The individual courses of the plasma recombinant plasma L-asparaginase activities after the first infusion 
are presented as unfitted graphs in the following spaghetti plot. 
Figure 22: Individual L-asparaginase AS activities versus time course after first 
administration (Study MC-ASP.2/RHN) 
From the L-asparaginase activities measured in plasma after the first infusion, the following individual 
pharmacokinetic parameters were computed with a non-compartmental model.

Table 39: Individual PK parameters (Study MC-ASP.2/RHN) 
The mean ± SD area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from end of first infusion to 72 h 
(primary endpoint) was 59,632 ± 12,784 h·U/L and ranged from 45,512 to 78,275 h·U/L. This result 
served  as  a  comparator  for  a  subsequently  conducted  bioequivalence  study  of  recombinant 
L-asparaginase versus a commercially available asparaginase preparation in children with de novo ALL. 
The  AUC  and  the  half-life  were  comparable  to  the  data  established  for  other  E.coli  L-asparaginase 
preparations. 
The peak activity (Cmax) of L-asparaginase was reached with a delay of about 2 hours after the end of the 
infusion. The reason for the delay is unknown. In only one patient, the Cmax was obtained at the end of 
infusion. The apparent volume of distribution in plasma at steady state was 2.5 L, which is equivalent to 
the plasma volume. 
Under treatment with L-asparaginase, the trough asparaginase activity was above the desired threshold 
level of >100 U/L.  Fourteen days after the last infusion, L-asparaginase activities were below the lower 
limit of quantification (as shown below). 
Table 40: Trough recombinant L-asparaginase activities (U/L) in plasma after repeated 
dosing (Study MC-ASP.2/RHN) 
The ASN concentrations rapidly dropped from the pre-treatment value of 47.8 ± 15.0 μM to below the 
limit of detection of the bioanalytical method at nearly all measured time points in all patients under 
treatment with L-asparaginase.

Table 41: Individual concentrations of ASN in plasma (μM) (Study MC-ASP.2/RHN) 
The ASN depletion in plasma was 98.7% immediately after end of infusion number 1 (time point 0 h) and 
remained above 99% in all patients under treatment until the final examination. 
A distinct long-lasting increase in ASP concentrations was observed from immediately after end of the first 
infusion (time point 0 h) until three days thereafter. In patients receiving more than one infusion, the ASP 
concentration remained elevated throughout the treatment and was still increased 14 days after the last 
infusion (data from only two patients available at that time point). 
A slight decrease in GLN plasma concentrations within four hours after the first infusion was observed. 
Thereafter,  GLN  concentrations  increased  again  returning  to  pre-treatment  values  at  six  hours  after 
infusion  and  remaining  comparable  to  those  until  54  hours  after  the  first  infusion  presumably  due  to 
increased endogenous production and/or exogenous supply of this amino acid. Before the second and the 
third infusion, GLN concentrations were elevated compared to baseline, but were slightly lower at the final 
examination.  
The arithmetic mean GLU concentration in plasma markedly increased during treatment with recombinant 
L-asparaginase and returned to values comparable to those before treatment start 14 days after the last 
infusion. 
Efficacy data 
Efficacy of treatment was evaluated by measuring the % reduction of peripheral blasts, and/or the % 
decrease  of  LDH,  and/or  the  %  decrease  of  paraprotein  (in  patients  with  MM  only)  compared  to  the 
corresponding baseline values. In all but two patients, a decrease of LDH was observed ranging from 
4.3% to 49.5%. The reduction of paraprotein was not determined because patients with MM were not 
included in the study. Apart from at baseline, peripheral blasts were not determined at any other time 
point during or after treatment in the AML patients. Therefore, the evaluation of efficacy with respect to 
reduction in peripheral blasts was not possible.

Figure 23: Spaghetti Plot of Individual Serum Trough Asparaginase Levels versus Day of 
Induction (Study MC-ASP.6/INF) 
The variability of the serum trough asparaginase levels between patients was high. Median serum trough 
asparaginase levels were 208.810 U/L on Day 18, 130.160 U/L on Day 25 and 32.420 U/L on Day 33. The 
trough asparaginase levels on Day 33 were considerably lower as compared to Day 18 and Day 25 which 
was due to the fact that the latter levels were assessed 3 days after recombinant asparaginase infusion 
while assessment on Day 33 was performed 4 days after the last recombinant asparaginase infusion.

Only 1 patient had detectable levels of asparagine in serum at Day 33.  The median baseline level of ASN 
was 48.155 μmoL/L (Min, Max 28.570, 79.710 μmoL/L). 
The  median  aspartic  acid  level  in  serum  was  3.18  μmoL/L  at  baseline.  On  Day  18  and  Day  25 
measurements  before  recombinant  asparaginase  infusion  resulted  in  increased  median  ASP  levels  of 
12.89  μmoL/L  (Min,  Max  5.10,  23.21  μmoL/L)  and  14.90  μmoL/L  (Min,  Max  4.91,  40.11  μmoL/L), 
respectively.  On  Day  33  the  median  ASP  level  had  decreased  to  7.58  μmoL/L  (Min,  Max  3.74,  44.19 
μmoL/L). 
The median level of glutamine was 476.90 μmoL/L at baseline decreasing slightly from 397.78 μmoL/L on 
Day 18 to 379.40 μmoL/L on Day 25 and to 347.77 μmoL/L (Min, Max 217.29, 490.34 μmoL/L) on Day 
33. 
The median level of glutamic acid was 94.89 μmoL/L at baseline and stayed steady during induction, 
decreasing slightly to 74.17 μmoL/L on Day 33.

Patients 
Number of patients planned: 15 
Number of patients included: 2 (22 yr old female/ 59 yr old male) 
Number of patients analysed: 2 
Treatment 
Patients  enrolled  in  this  study  were  to  undergo  treatment  for  ALL  relapse  according  to  the  GMALL 
(German Multicenter ALL Study Group (for adults)) relapse protocol ALLREZ 02/92. In this protocol, the 
use of 10,000 U/m2 per dose of a native asparaginase is scheduled. For this study, however, the native 
asparaginase is replaced with the new recombinant product at the same dose. 
Patients received 4 infusions at study days 7, 8, 14, and 15 within a total study duration of 24 days. 
Results 
The study was terminated after enrolment of two patients due to very poor recruitment.  
Pharmacokinetic results 
The trough asparaginase activity in serum was mostly above the desired threshold level of 100 U/L. 
Pharmacodynamic and efficacy results 
The patients showed complete ASN depletion in serum. Minor short-time glutamine cleavage was shown. 
No systematic changes in aspartic acid and glutamic acid were observed. 
In one patient, remission status after end of induction treatment could not be assessed due to numerous 
missing values for peripheral blood and bone marrow parameters. The second patient did not enter into 
a complete remission presenting with 10 % blasts in bone marrow after induction.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Recombinant  asparaginase  (Spectrila)  has  been  studied  in  two  main  trials:  one  pivotal  phase  III 
(MC-ASP.5/ALL)  and  one  phase  II  (MC-ASP.4/ALL).  In  both  trials,  recombinant  asparaginase  was 
compared  to  asparaginase  medac.  The  MC-ASP.4/ALL  and  MC-ASP.5/ALL  trials  had  a  common  study 
design 
(randomised,  double-blind,  asparaginase  medac-controlled),  with  similar  endpoints 
(pharmacodynamics and efficacy), and selected target populations (de novo ALL children ≥ 1 ≤ 18 years 
old).  
Against what was recommended by the CHMP (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/164920/2005), the Applicant did not 
perform a dose-finding study. A preliminary dose selection would have been preferable, based on the high 
species-specific  variability  and  the  PK/PD  differences  observed  between  asparaginase  medac  and 
recombinant asparaginase in non-clinical studies (see non-clinical section).  
The  CHMP  recommended  that  the  applicant  demonstrate  the  pharmacodynamic  equivalence  of 
Asparaginase medac and recombinant L-asparaginase, using suppression of asparagine concentrations 
as a measure (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/164920/2005). The Applicant was also advised to provide adequate 
reassurance  for  the  validity  of  the  asparagine  assay,  in  particular,  the  potential  for  asparaginase  to 
interfere  with  the  sensitivity  of  the  assay.  Supportive  evidence  of  pharmacological  equivalence  was 
expected to be provided, specifically for the measures: intracellular concentration of asparagine, plasma 
asparaginase activity and suppression of asparagine concentration in CSF. Data showing the adequate 
suppression of serum asparagine concentrations after repeat dosing was requested in order to confirm 
that efficacy is maintained with repeat dosing. The protocol assistance was in general followed except for 
the evaluation of intracellular concentration of asparagine which was not conducted based on literature 
data  showing  that  no  changes  in  intracellular  levels  of  twenty  amino  acids  including  ASN  could  be 
measured in leukaemic cells in vivo after treatment with a single dose of pegylated asparaginase (Appel 
et  al.).  The  lack  of  data  on  intracellular  asparaginase  is  not  expected  to  significantly  impact  the 
benefit-risk of the product. 
With regards to PK evaluation, the Applicant used the microplate reader-based method (AHA-assay) for 
measuring asparaginase activity in serum, plasma and CSF. Asparaginase activity rather than amount of 
protein was measured which is acceptable. The validation of the assay is also acceptable. However, during 
the  evaluation  of  the  dossier,  the  EMA  was  alerted  of  previous  GCP  non-compliance  detected  at  the 
laboratory  site  which  was  involved  in  the  conduct  of  the  two  mains  studies  MC-ASP.4/ALL  and 
MC-ASP.5/ALL and therefore a GCP triggered inspection was requested. Several findings were identified 
during the inspection, including one critical finding within the laboratory site concerning the asparaginase 
assay  in  study  MC-ASP.5/ALL.  Specifically,  the  finding  was  that  of  non-adherence  to  the  study  plan 
criteria  for  accepting  or  rejecting  calibration  standards  for  the  asparaginase  assay.  Therefore,  some 
batches  which  should  have  failed  were  passed,  whilst  one  which  should  have  passed  was  failed. 
Recalculations of the asparaginase data were provided, using the methods outlined in the study plan. 
Applying  the  more  stringent  analysis  method  (method  I)  the  number  of  non-valid  samples  was 
considerably increased compared to the original method; although a fair proportion occurred on Day 12, 
i.e. baseline. Data from this re-analysis showed that the mean asparaginase activity differences between 
the  study  arms  at  the  later  study  time  points  were  slightly  larger  than  initially  shown  (Asparaginase 
medac  >  recombinant  asparaginase)  with  data  based  on  the  original  analysis  method  (see  efficacy 
analysis). The trend towards increasing size of the difference between the proportion of subjects in the 
test  and  reference  arms  with  samples  registering  <100U/L  of  asparaginase  activity  as  the  study 
progressed appeared to be maintained within the analysis of method I samples. These differences were 
seen  with  the  originally  presented  data  and  were  of  similar  magnitude;  with  no  suggestion  that  the 
method I analyses (unlike the other PK analyses) result in larger differences between test and reference 
Assessment report

product. Likewise, the results of the method I analyses of samples with asparaginase activity < and ≥ 100 
U/L did not differ significantly from the originally presented analyses. 
Regarding pharmacodynamic parameters, the Applicant described in detail the methods for the detection 
of asparagine in human serum and CSF. The Applicant also discussed data from a number of ex-vivo 
experiments and publications which rather suggested that even at low temperatures (2-8◦C) and with a 
range of activity levels, asparaginase hydrolysis of asparaginase still occurred with very high velocity. 
Overall, whilst acknowledging that there appears not to be an optimal method for  inhibiting asparaginase 
activity  immediately  after  venepuncture,  consequently  halting  ex-vivo  hydrolysis  of  asparagine,  it  is 
considered that appropriate steps were taken to halt asparaginase activity as soon as practicably possible 
after venepuncture. The assay was also appropriately validated for its intended purpose.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters of complete asparagine depletion and serum 
asparaginase activity are considered the main outcome measures provided in support of comparable 
efficacy between the test and the comparator. Efficacy outcomes are only considered supportive in this 
development programme. 
The pharmacokinetics of recombinant asparaginase versus native asparaginase was evaluated after 
intravenous infusion of a first dose in 30 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in study 
MC-ASP.4/ALL. Additionally, trough levels were evaluated in serum during induction treatment in studies 
MC-ASP.1/ALL, MC-ASP.5/ALL, MC-ASP.6/INF and MC-ASP.4/ALL. A limited number of adult patients 
were evaluated. Unfortunately, the adult studies MC-ASP.1/ALL and MC-ASP.2/RHN were terminated 
early due to poor recruitment with only 10 adult patients enrolled. The applicant will conduct a 
post-approval study evaluating PK, PD and safety (incl. immunogenicity) in adult ALL patients as reflected 
in the RMP (additional pharmacovigilance activity). This study will enable to generate further efficacy data 
in adult patients.     
In  study  MC-ASP.4/ALL  where the  equivalence of  asparaginase medac  and  recombinant  asparaginase 
was evaluated using AUC0-72h, a statistically significant difference was seen between the two study arms 
(p=0.020). The point estimate of the AUC0-72h for the test treatment was lower than that of the reference 
product, with a point estimate of the treatment ratio of 86.01. The confidence intervals of the geometric 
mean  ratio  between  the  groups  fell  within  the  acceptance  limits  set.  However,  these  limits  had  been 
widened  from  the  usual  80-125  %  bracket  to  75-133%  leading  to  uncertainties  regarding  the 
bioequivalence between recombinant asparaginase and asparaginase medac.   
From the trough measurements provided, it appears that activity for recombinant asparaginase may be 
up to 20% lower than that of asparaginase medac. The higher serum activities could possibly be due to 
the higher levels of aggregates seen in the asparaginase medac product (20.5%) compared to 
recombinant asparaginase (approx. 0.3%). In the larger study MC-ASP.5/ALL, a trend to greater 
asparaginase activity, which increased towards the end of the induction treatment period was seen.  This 
effect possibly results from the longer half-life of aggregates, which progressively increases activity of 
asparaginase medac in comparison to the relatively constant level of serum activities in the recombinant 
asparaginase group. The size of the differences in trough activities in the latter half of the dosing period 
were further increased by the method I analysis.  
With regard to activity measurements in the subgroups of infants and adults, a proportion of patients 
experienced decreases in asparaginase activity with repeated administration. There is no comparison to 
asparaginase medac in these subgroups and in general data collection was patchy as a significant number 
of  patients  withdrew  before  study  completion  for  a  number  of  adverse  events  and  experienced  silent 
inactivation  of  asparaginase.  However,  considering the  experience  gained  with  the  widespread  use  of 
asparaginases in treatment protocols for these groups it is considered that efficacy and safety of Spectrila 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015

in toddlers, children and adolescents, can be extrapolated to these subgroups. Additional data will also be 
available from the planned post-approval study evaluating PK, PD and safety (incl. immunogenicity) in 
adult ALL patients (see RMP). 
Some literature data (primarily non-clinical) suggest that a trough asparaginase activity of >100U/L is 
required for effective clearance of asparagine from plasma and CSF. However, data presented by the 
applicant for both studies MC-ASP.4-ALL and MC-ASP.5-ALL (PK/PD graphs not shown) showed that even 
asparaginase activities as low as 10U/L were associated with complete asparagine depletion in serum. 
This  was  also  observed  in  the  infant  study.  Data  on  paired  serum  asparaginase  and  CSF  asparagine 
samples  were  provided,  showing  that  even  where  patients  failed  to  maintain  serum  asparaginase 
activities above 100U/L, asparagine depletion in CSF was complete. 
Data  from  all  clinical  studies  with  recombinant  asparaginase  showed  swift,  sustained  and  complete 
reductions in serum and CSF asparagine. The primary endpoint in the pivotal study, MC-ASP.5 /ALL, was 
the pharmacodynamic endpoint of complete asparagine depletion. This was accepted as a valid surrogate 
for  clinical  efficacy  of  asparaginases.  The  non-inferiority/equivalence  margin  for  the  comparison  of 
recombinant asparaginase to asparaginase medac was set at 10%. As the confidence intervals for the risk 
difference in both the per protocol set and full analysis set fall entirely within [-10%, 10%], the study was 
considered  to  have  met  its  primary  endpoint.  Statistically  the  non-inferiority  margin  was  adequately 
justified in line with EMA guidance on selecting a non-inferiority margin, with a substantial fraction of the 
asparaginase  medac  effect  over  placebo  (at  least  89.5%)  preserved  with  recombinant  asparaginase 
treatment. However, the margin was less well justified clinically and it was unclear that a 10% difference 
in the proportion of patients with complete asparagine depletion would not lead to a clinically relevant 
difference in efficacy. Nevertheless, it was noted that the point estimates showed the proportions to be 
nearly equal.  
Further  supportive  evidence  of  efficacy  was  sought  through  comparison  of  data  for  other  PD  and  PK 
endpoints  which  would  reflect  depth  of  asparagine  depletion  and  cumulative  exposure  to  enzyme 
activities  known  to  be  associated  with  pronounced  anti-leukemic  effects.  These  endpoints  included 
duration of asparagine depletion, time to asparagine recovery (to pre-study levels), proportion of patients 
(and  samples)  with  asparaginase  activity  below  100U/L  and  duration  of  asparaginase  activity  above 
100 U/L. Small and non-statistically significant differences favouring asparaginase medac in duration of 
ASN depletion in serum, proportion of patients with ASNase activity >100 U/L, and proportion of samples 
with ASNase activity in serum <100 U/L during indication phase from day 15 to day 33 of protocol were 
reported.  Minor  differences  between  rASNase  and  ASNase  Medac  in  Study  MC-ASP.4/ALL  were  also 
observed  with  regard  to  asparagine  recovery  results.  However,  there  were  significant  limitations 
associated with the submitted post-hoc analyses whcih undermine the robustness of the data; including 
sparse PK and PD sampling after the final adminsitation of asparaginase, a number of missing estimates  
and  the  small  sample  size  in  in  Study  MC-ASP.4/ALL.  Given  the  limitations  these  data  cannot  be 
considered conclusive and should be interpreted with caution. 
Increases  in  aspartic  acid,  a  degradation  product  of  asparagine  were  seen  as  expected  in  both  study 
arms, although greater increases were seen in the asparaginase medac study arms. Changes in the levels 
of the other amino acids monitored did not reveal any notable differences between the two study arms.  
The clinical relevance of the observed differences in PK and PD endpoints was discussed. The Applicant 
noted that duration of ASN depletion after last ASNase infusion and recovery of ASN to baseline value has 
been  described  as  relevant  endpoints  in  previous  clinical  trials  with  native  ASNase  preparations.  In 
addition, ASN depletion in serum and CSF being the main surrogate for efficacy were considered more 
important than ASNase activity levels. Asparagine levels decreased after the first dose of either ASNase 
preparation and remained depleted until end of ASNase treatment. Although lower ASNase activity was 
observed for Spectrila versus ASNase medac the company argued that ASNase trough serum activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 96/132 
  
  
 
levels as low as 10-20 U/L led to complete ASN depletion in serum and CSF based on the provided data 
and that supporting literature data show that lower levels than 100 IU/L are sufficient. 
Some  clinical efficacy  measures  were  evaluated in  the  comparative  clinical  studies  e.g.  time to  event 
measures, response rate and overall survival. For these outcomes there was very little difference between 
the study arms in the larger comparative trials. This was expected as the response rates in children with 
ALL enrolled on current induction treatment protocols normally show very good improvement and often 
remission. The assay sensitivity of these endpoints is considered low, as the response rates are usually 
exceptional and as a small number of events occur within clinical trials of reasonable length. 
Complete remission rates are in line with what would be expected with this type of multi-agent induction 
treatment regimen. Minor differences are reported between the two arms in both studies. However, the 
number of patients included in the MC-ASP.4/ALL study is too small for interpretation of the data, and the 
differences between arms in the MC-ASP.5/ALL study could be partially influenced by an imbalance in NE 
and NK cases between the treatment arms. 
Similar  efficacy  in  terms  of  relapse-  and  event-free  survival  (RFS  and  EFS)  was  observed  between 
recombinant asparaginase and asparaginase medac. Analysis of clinical efficacy parameters by genetic 
subtype (no aberration, Hyperdiploid, BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1, MLL-AF4),  immunophenotype (common ALL, 
pre-B  ALL,  pre-pre  B  ALL,  T-ALL)  and  disease  characteristics  was  undertaken  and  showed  no  major 
differences between treatment arms or subgroups; although a number of these groups contained limited 
numbers of patients. 
The efficacy of recombinant asparaginase and incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (see clinical safety) 
were  also  assessed  in  12  infants  patients  (≤ 1  year)  in  the  uncontrolled  MC-ASP.6/INF  study.  Silent 
inactivation was reported in 4 out of the 12 enrolled patients (33%), even though no ADAs were detected 
in any patients. Nonetheless, complete ASN depletion was obtained in all but one subject. After induction 
treatment all patients were in CR and all but one achieved positive MRD status.  
Data from the intensification stages of treatment are limited as only a small number of patients continuing 
asparaginase medac or recombinant asparagine treatment were enrolled into the high-risk (HR) group. 
The size of these subgroups makes it difficult to interpret the data submitted for that period. However the 
experience with the use of asparaginases in the post-induction phases in ALL treatment protocols is large. 
Therefore,  if  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Spectrila  in  induction  treatment  is  justified  and  its  use  in 
post-induction treatment phases does not need to be restricted. 
Efficacy of Spectrila has not been established in Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
The sought indication for Spectrila included both acute B/T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and B/T 
cell  lymphoblastic  lymphoma  (LBL).  However,  no  B/T  cell  LBL  patients  have  been  treated  with 
recombinant asparaginase in the submitted clinical trials. LBL is rare and has a very similar treatment 
strategy  (i.e.,  chemotherapy  regimens)  to  ALL.  Therefore,  a  more  concise  indication  referring  to  the 
treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years and adults is 
recommended. The LBL patient group is considered covered by this indication. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Non-inferiority of Spectrila to asparaginase medac is considered shown on the basis of asparaginase 
depletion. Although PK differences between Spectrila and asparaginase medac were observed, these 
were not considered clinically significant. Further, the data showed that much lower serum asparaginase 
activities still resulted in complete asparagine depletion. Efficacy data will be available in adults as PK, PD,

safety and immunogenicity data will be collected post-approval in a single-arm adult de novo ALL patients 
study (see RMP). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In total, 135 patients have been treated with recombinant asparaginase within five clinical studies 
sponsored by medac. The proposed standard administration schedule of recombinant asparaginase is 
5,000 – 10,000 U/m² b.w. given intravenously every three days. The following tables list the dose 
regimen, duration of treatment, and maximum total dose of recombinant asparaginase within 5 clinical 
trials.

Doses ranged from 2,400 U per dose to 9,400 U per dose, corresponding to a total of 19,200 U and 75,200 
U, respectively, for eight infusions. One patient discontinued prematurely and only received the first 
seven infusions; all other patients received all eight scheduled asparaginase infusions. 
Study MC-ASP.2/RHN: Extent of exposure 
Seven patients received at least one dose of recombinant L-asparaginase (5,000 U/m²) and were 
evaluated for safety.

specific treatment phases – overall and stratified by risk group (SAS) (Study MC-ASP.5/ALL) 
Thirty six (36) patients of the 37 hypersensitive patients in the Asparaginase medac group tested positive 
for anti-asparaginase antibodies. Of these 35 were already antibody-positive before administration of first 
asparaginase dose during the post-induction phase. Of the 36 hypersensitive patients in the recombinant 
asparaginase  group,  33  had  anti-drug  antibodies.  30  were  already  antibody-positive  before 
administration  of  the  first  asparaginase  dose  during  post-induction  phase.  16  patients  in  the 
Asparaginase  medac  group  and  22  patients  in  the  recombinant  asparaginase  group  were  positive  for 
anti-asparaginase antibodies before and/or after first asparaginase dose in post-induction treatment, but 
did  not  show  signs  of  clinical  allergy  or  silent  inactivation.  Of  these  patients,  10  patients  in  the 
Asparaginase medac group and 12 patients in the recombinant asparaginase group could fulfil their full 
course of asparaginase treatment, but six patients in the Asparaginase medac group and 10 patients in 
the recombinant asparaginase group switched to an alternative asparaginase later.

•  Study - MC-ASP.4/ALL 
During induction phase A, 69 events occurred in 14 subjects (87.5%) under the test and 74 events in 16 
subjects (100%) under the reference treatment. One event was observed during induction phase B. Most 
patients had gastrointestinal adverse events (75%), followed by neurological events (56.3%), pain 
(40.6%), infections (28.1%), constitutional symptoms (25%), and dermal events (12.5%). The event 
during induction phase B (post-asparaginase medac) was severe venous thrombosis at a vascular access 
site. No deaths occurred during the study. Twenty-seven events observed in 15 subjects (46.9%), mainly 
gastrointestinal events (40.6%), were assessed to be at least possibly related to the study drug. 
•  Study MC-ASP.2/RHN 
In total, 32 adverse events were observed in five patients with three events (pneumonia, septicaemia, 
and femoral neck fracture) being serious. Only one event (elevation of alkaline phosphatase) was 
assessed to be related to recombinant L-asparaginase by the investigator; all other events were 
considered to be unlikely or not related to the study drug. 75% were of mild or moderate intensity (CTC 
grade 1 or 2). The most common adverse events involved constitutional symptoms, metabolic/laboratory 
changes, pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and infections. 
•  Study MC-ASP.6/ALL 
All 12 patients experienced at least one AE. Seven patients (58%) experienced AEs that were at least 
CTCAE grade III, 3 patients (25%) experienced AEs that were drug related (rash, nausea, febrile 
neutopaenia, thrombosis). Three patients (25%) experienced at least one AE typical for asparaginase 
(nose bleed, thrombosis of the superior vena cava superior, elevated level of ALT & GPT). 
The primary endpoint of study MC-ASP.6/ALL was hypersensitivity reactions during induction.

In 2 of the 4 patients asparaginase trough levels were below 20 U/L on Day 33, in 1 patient on Day 25 and 
Day 33 and in 1 patient on Day 25 only. No clinical allergic reaction was documented within 12 hours after 
IP infusion. No antibodies against asparaginase were detected in any of the patients. 
Serum levels of anti-asparaginase antibodies were measured directly before recombinant asparaginase 
infusions on Days 15 (baseline value), 18, 25 and 33. All patients measured on these days were negative 
for anti-recombinant asparaginase antibodies.

Adverse events were pooled for the two pivotal trials MC-ASP.4/ALL and MC-ASP.5/ALL and presented 
using MedDRA terms. For mapping purposes in study MC-ASP.5/ALL CTCAE version 3.0 was firstly 
mapped to CTCAE version 4, followed by mapping to MedDRA version 12.1. The table showing 
drug-related AEs and Grade≥3 drug-related AEs in the safety analysis set are reported below:

•  Study MC-ASP.5/ALL 
Serum Chemistry during Induction Phase 
The median creatinine levels remained steady and unchanged during the induction phase. Bilirubin levels 
were elevated to between approximately 1.0- and 0.61-fold (upper limit of normal) ULN from 0.590-fold 
ULN at baseline. Median AST and ALT estimates dipped by approximately a third during the study. Serum 
amylase levels were raised slightly in the early part of the induction phase from a baseline of 0.580-fold 
ULN.  However  levels  dropped  to  approximately  85%  of  baseline  levels  toward  the  end  of  the  study.  
Glucose levels also dropped from a baseline of approximately 6 mmol/L to between 4 and 5 mmol/L. The 
median baseline levels of total protein were 64 g/L in patients receiving asparaginase medac and 66 g/L 
in patients receiving recombinant asparaginase. During induction phase median levels were between 58 
g/L  and  48  g/L  in  the  asparaginase  medac  treatment  group  and  between  59  g/L  and  48  g/L  in  the 
recombinant asparaginase treatment group.  There was no difference in the pattern of changes described 
above between the study arms.  
Coagulation during Induction Phase 
For the majority of the induction period fibrinogen levels dipped to approximately 50% of baseline levels. 
However, during the 6th week of the induction period, levels rose rapidly to approximately 2.5-fold LLN. 
Similarly antithrombin III levels fell by approximately 50% from baseline until week 6 where levels rose 
to  just  under  baseline  values.  Just  as  with  the  serum  biochemistry  data  changes  in the  asparaginase 
medac group were mirrored in the recombinant asparaginase group.  
Haematology during Induction Phase 
For  leukocytes,  levels  fell to  <50%  of  baseline,  rising  to  above  baseline  levels  by  the  5th  week.    The 
median baseline levels of leukocytes were 1.60 g/L in both treatment groups. During induction median 
levels were between 1.76 g/L and 0.72 g/L in the asparaginase medac group and between 1.75 g/L and 
0.88  g/L  in  the  recombinant  asparaginase  group.  Thrombocytes  steadily  rose  from  baseline 
(approximately  62g/L)  to  a  peak  of  150  g/L  in  the  asparaginase  medac  group  and  154  g/L  in  the 
recombinant asparaginase group.  
•  Study - MC-ASP.4/ALL 
One patient had low sodium concentrations in serum (CTC v.3.0, grade 3=severe) on Day 33, all other 
abnormal values were mild or moderate. No differences over time in safety laboratory values between the 
two treatments were observed. 
•  Study MC-ASP.2/RHN 
Deviations from the normal values (CTC grade 3, rarely 4) were observed in a few blood chemistry 
parameters, most coagulation parameters, and in the haemogram. CTC grade 3/4 changes in liver 
parameters (i.e. elevation of gamma-glutamyltransferase, γ-GT) and a decrease in total serum protein 
concentration as a consequence of impaired protein synthesis, were observed in two patients and are 
well-known and labelled side effects of treatment with L-asparaginase. Disturbances in the coagulation 
system are also known typical side effects. All seven patients showed pronounced changes in coagulation 
parameters. 
•  Study MC-ASP.6/ALL 
Median safety laboratory parameters showed little variability. Low levels in blood cell counts were 
attributed to the underlying disease and treatment. Coagulation parameters decreased slightly during the 
treatment phase which could be attributed to treatment with recombinant asparaginase. 
Immunogenicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 114/132 
  
  
 
In the study in children/adolescents aged 1 – 18 years with de novo ALL (MC-ASP.5/ALL), by day 33 of 
induction treatment 10 patients in the Spectrila group (10.3 %) and 9 in the reference group (8.9 %) 
were measured positive for anti-asparaginase antibodies at least at one time point.  
A comparable proportion of patients in both groups developed anti-asparaginase antibodies before the 
start of the post-induction treatment phase (Spectrila 54.6 % vs. reference E. coli asparaginase 52.5 %). 
The majority of anti-asparaginase antibodies developed in the time gap between the last L asparaginase 
infusion on day 33 and start of post-induction treatment at day 79. 
No anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected in any of the 12 infants < 1 year of age during treatment 
with L asparaginase (MC-ASP.6/INF) (see SmPC section 4.8). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The provided safety database for recombinant asparaginase is limited (data on 135 patients included) 
which is acceptable considering the rarity of ALL. In the single arm studies, all the planned infusions were 
administered,  with  the  exception  of  study  MC-ASP.2/RHN  enrolling  heavily  pre-treated  or  refractory 
patients in which the full course of treatment was not completed. 
Since Spectrila is usually used in combination therapy with other antineoplastic agents, the demarcation 
from undesirable effects of other medicinal products is often difficult (see SmPC section 4.8). 
The profile of adverse effects of recombinant asparaginase was broadly similar to that of asparaginase 
medac. No noteworthy differences were indicated for events of thrombosis, pancreatitis and liver function 
changes.  
A higher rate of patients with drug-related AEs Grade ≥ III (19.6% vs. 13.9%) and drug-related serious 
AEs  (18.6%  vs.  15.8%),  was  recorded  in  the  recombinant  asparaginase  arm  in  the  pivotal  study 
compared  to  asparaginase  medac.  No  further  safety  signal  in  addition  to  those  already  known  to  be 
associated to asparaginase treatment have been registered, even though a slightly increased rate of ADR 
has been registered with rASNase (37.1% vs. 32.7%), in particular for the terms: Infections (12.4% vs. 
5.9%),  Gastrointestinal  events  (9.3%  vs.  6.9%),  and  Haemorrhage/bleeding  (5.2%  vs.  1.0%).  The 
differences  were  not  however  considered  clinically  relevant  and  were  not  generally  seen  in  the  other 
clinical studies.     
The  primary  toxicity  of  asparaginase  results  from  immunologic  reactions  caused  by  exposure  to  the 
bacterial  protein.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  range  from  transient  flushing  or  rash  and  urticaria  to 
bronchospasm, angioedema and anaphylaxis. 
Spectrila  can  induce  antibodies of  different  immunoglobulin  classes  (IgG,  IgM,  IgE).  These  antibodies 
may induce clinical allergic reactions, inactivate the enzymatic activity or accelerate the elimination of 
asparaginase. Allergic reactions can manifest as flushing, rash, pain (joint pain, back pain and abdominal 
pain), hypotension, oedema/angioedema, urticaria, dyspnoea, bronchospasm up to anaphylactic shock. 
The probability of the occurrence of allergic reactions increases with the number of administered doses; 
however, in very rare cases reactions can occur at the first dose of asparaginase. Most hypersensitivity 
reactions to asparaginase are observed during subsequent treatment phases (re-induction treatment, 
delayed intensification). 
Spectrila was not considered to have a more favourable safety profile to that of asparaginase medac, 
particularly with regard to anti-drug antibody (ADA) development, as was hypothesized by the applicant 
on the basis of the lower aggregate content of the test product.  
The binding antibody data presented indicate a low and similar rate of ADA formation during the induction 
phase for both study arms. The ADA titres were similar and overall there was no indication of stronger 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 115/132 
  
  
 
ADA responses to recombinant asparaginase than to asparaginase medac by incidence or concentration 
of ADAs. Interestingly, large increases in ADA incidence and titre occurred in both study arms before the 
first dose of post-induction treatment and then further increases in titre before HR/MR/SR 2 blocks (2nd 
post-induction phase). Incidence of hypersensitivity reactions also markedly increased, as did incidence 
of asparaginase inactivation. By the end of the asparaginase induction treatment approximately 50% of 
patients  had  developed  antibodies.  Asparaginase  was  not  administered  between  the  induction  and 
high-risk (HR) block phases. Immune system reconstitution could be a reason for this observation since 
treatment with corticosteroids and some anti-neoplastic agents had ceased, although this has not been 
confirmed.    Almost  all  patients  experiencing  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  ADA  positive,  providing 
evidence of a good correlation between the two. In infant patients (study MC-ASP.6/INF) no ADAs were 
detected  and  the  possible  explanation  for  the  silent  inactivation  reported  in  33%  of  patients  remains 
unknown.  
The anti-drug antibody assay was reasonably well performed. The ADA data refer to binding antibodies. 
It  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  ADA  assay  underestimates  the  incidence  and  titre  of  ADAs  due  to 
interference with ADA determination by asparaginase. Decreased asparaginase activity has been included 
as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Overall,  the  immunogenicity  and  hypersentivity  reactions  have been  well  addressed  in  the  SmPC  and 
RMP. Because of the risk of severe anaphylactic reactions asparaginase should not be administered as a 
bolus intravenous injection. A previous intracutaneous test or a small intravenous test dose can be used. 
Both procedures, however, do not allow for predicting accurately which patients will experience an allergic 
reaction. If allergic symptoms occur, administration of asparaginase must be discontinued immediately 
and appropriate treatment given, which may include antihistamines and corticosteroids (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any native (non-pegylated) E. coli-asparaginase  preparation or 
to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 is a contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
In addition, measurement of the asparaginase activity level in serum or plasma may be undertaken in 
order to rule out accelerated reduction of asparaginase activity.  Preferably, levels should be measured 
three days after the last asparaginase administration, i.e. usually directly before the next dose of 
asparaginase is given. Low asparaginase activity levels are often accompanied by the appearance of 
anti-asparaginase antibodies. In such cases, a switch to a different asparaginase preparation should be 
considered. Expert advice should first be sought (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Treatment with asparaginase can also result in disturbances in organ systems which exhibit a high level 
of  protein  synthesis.  Decreased  protein  synthesis  can  predominantly  lead  to  liver  impairment,  acute 
pancreatitis, decreased insulin production with hyperglycaemia, decreased production of clotting factors 
(especially fibrinogen and antithrombin III) leading to coagulation disorders (thrombosis, bleeding), and 
decreased production of lipoproteins resulting in hypertriglyceridaemia. 
In rare cases severe liver impairment has been described, including cholestasis, icterus, hepatic necrosis 
and hepatic failure with fatal outcome (see sections 4.8 and 4.5). Liver parameters should be monitored 
closely before and during treatment with asparaginase. Treatment with asparaginase should be 
interrupted if patients develop severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 times the upper limit of normal 
[ULN]; transaminases > 10 times ULN), severe hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperglycaemia or coagulation 
disorder (e.g. sinus vein thrombosis, severe bleeding). (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Severe hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin > 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN]; transaminases > 10 times ULN) is a 
contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
The serum protein level (especially albumin) decreases very commonly in patients treated with 
asparaginase as a result of impaired protein synthesis (see section 4.4). As a consequence of 
hypoalbuminaemia, oedema can occur (see SmPC section 4.8). Since serum protein is important for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 116/132 
  
  
 
binding and transport function of some active substances, the serum protein level should be monitored 
regularly (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Changes in endocrine pancreatic function are observed very commonly during treatment with 
asparaginase and manifest predominantly as hyperglycaemia. These events are usually transient. 
Additionally asparaginase may decrease insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and impair insulin 
receptor function. The syndrome is generally self-limiting. However, in rare cases it can result in diabetic 
ketoacidosis. Concomitant treatment with corticosteroids contributes to this effect. Serum and urine 
glucose levels should be regularly monitored and managed as clinically indicated (see SmPC sections 4.4 
and 4.8). Hypoglycaemia mostly without clinical symptoms has been commonly observed in patients 
treated with asparaginase. The mechanism leading to this reaction is unknown. (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Treatment with asparaginase should be discontinued in patients developing acute pancreatitis. Acute 
pancreatitis has developed in less than 10 % of patients. A few cases of asparaginase-induced parotitis 
have been reported in the literature. In rare cases, haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis occurs. There 
have been isolated reports of fatal outcomes. Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting and anorexia. Serum amylase and lipase are usually elevated, although in some patients they 
can be normal due to impaired protein synthesis. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia are at 
increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis. These patients should no longer be treated with any 
asparaginase preparation (see SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8). Pancreatitis and history of pancreatitis, 
with prior asparaginase therapy are contraindications (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Mild to moderate changes in blood lipid values (e.g. increased or decreased cholesterol, increased 
triglyceride, increased VLDL fraction and decreased LDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity) are very 
commonly observed in patients treated with asparaginase, which in most cases present without clinical 
symptoms. Concomitant administration of glucocorticoids may be a contributing factor. However, in rare 
cases severe hypertriglyceridaemia (triglycerides > 1,000 mg/dl) has been reported. 
Asparaginase-associated hyperlipidaemia should be treated depending on its severity and on clinical 
symptoms (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Due to the inhibition of protein synthesis (decreased synthesis of factors II, V, VII, VIII, and IX, proteins 
C and S, antithrombin III [AT III]) caused by asparaginase, coagulation disorders can occur which can 
manifest either as thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or bleeding. The risk of 
thrombosis seems to be higher than the risk of bleeding. Symptomatic thromboses related to the use of 
central venous catheters have been described, too. Approximately half of the thrombotic events is 
localised in cerebral vessels. Sinus vein thrombosis can occur. Ischaemic strokes are rare. Acquired or 
genetically decreased physiologic coagulation inhibitors (protein C, protein S, antithrombin) are also 
described in relation to vascular complications. Frequent evaluation of coagulation parameters is 
important before and during asparaginase treatment. Expert advice should be sought in cases where AT 
III is decreased (see SmPC section 4.4). Pre-existing known coagulopathy (e.g. haemophilia) and history 
of serious haemorrhage or serious thrombosis with prior asparaginase therapy are contraindications (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
In the pivotal study, grade IV thrombocytopenia events (19.6% vs. 10.9%) were more frequently 
reported in the recombinant asparaginase arm versus asparaginase medac. It cannot be concluded that 
this is associated with the slight increase in bleeding ADRs seen in this treatment arm as the difference in 
bleeding rate between the study arms was small and not clinically relevant.  
With regards to endocrine disorders, there have been reports of transitory secondary hypothyroidism 
probably caused by a decrease in the serum thyroxin-binding globulin due to asparaginase-induced 
protein synthesis inhibition (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 117/132 
  
  
 
Nausea/vomiting  are  very  commonly  observed  in  patients  treated  with  asparaginase-containing 
treatment regimens but are usually mild. Anorexia, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and 
weight loss have also been reported (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Hyperammonaemia  has  been  reported  uncommonly  in  patients  treated  with  asparaginase-containing 
therapy protocols, especially if patients suffer additionally from hepatic impairment. In very rare cases, 
severe hyperammonaemia has been reported which may induce neurologic disorders such as seizures 
and  coma  (see  SmPC  section  4.8).  Plasma  ammonia  levels  should  be  determined  in  all  patients  with 
unexplained neurologic symptoms or severe and prolonged vomiting. In case of hyperammonaemia with 
severe  clinical  symptoms,  therapeutic  and  pharmacological  measures  that  rapidly  reduce  plasma 
ammonia  levels  (e.g.  protein  restriction  and  haemodialysis),  reverse  catabolic  states  and  increase 
removal  of  nitrogen  wastes  should  be  initiated  and  expert  advice  sought  (see  SmPC  section  4.4). 
Hyperammonia is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Adverse central nervous system reactions observed in patients treated with asparaginase-containing 
therapy protocols include changes in EEG, seizures, dizziness, somnolence, coma and headache. The 
causes of these nervous system disorders are unclear. Hyperammonaemia and sinus vein thrombosis 
may need to be excluded. In rare cases, a reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has 
been observed during therapy with asparaginase-containing regimens (see section 4.8). This syndrome is 
characterised in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by reversible (from a few days to months) 
lesions/oedema, primarily in the posterior region of the brain. Symptoms of RPLS essentially include 
elevated blood pressure, seizures, headaches, changes in mental state and acute visual impairment 
(primarily cortical blindness or homonymous hemianopsia). It is unclear whether the RPLS is caused by 
asparaginase, concomitant treatment or the underlying diseases. RPLS is treated symptomatically, 
including measures to treat any seizures. Discontinuation or dose reduction of concomitantly 
administered immunosuppressive medicinal products may be necessary. Expert advice should be sought 
(see SmPC section 4.4). 
Asparaginase-induced tumour cell destruction may release large amounts of uric acid, resulting in 
hyperuricaemia. Co-administration of other antineoplastic medicinal products contributes to this effect. 
Aggressive alkalinisation of the urine and use of allopurinol can prevent urate nephropathy (see SmPC 
section 4.4). In view of this and although no case of tumour lysis have been reported in the clinical trials, 
this safety concern has been included in the RMP as a potential risk.   
Adverse events with fatal outcome, mainly due to infections, were reported in 4 patients treated with 
recombinant asparaginase in study MC-ASP.5/ALL (sudden death; disseminated aspergillus opportunistic 
infection; cerebral aspergillus infection) and in study MC-ASP.2/RHN (septicaemia), whereas no deaths 
occurred in the asparaginase medac group during the induction phase. Infections (including opportunistic 
and  fungal  infections)  are  identified  risks  in  the  RMP  that  will  be  closely  monitored  (see  RMP). 
Concomitant vaccination with live vaccines increases the risk of serious infection. Immunisation with live 
vaccines  should  therefore  take  place  at  the  earliest  3  months  after  completion  of  the  course  of 
antileukaemic  treatment  (see  SmPC  section  4.5).  Potential  interactions  with  live  vaccines  are  also 
adequately addressed in the RMP. 
During  treatment  with  asparaginase-containing  regimens,  myelosuppression,  potentially  affecting  all 
three  cell  lines  (and  infections  as  mentioned  above)  can  occur.  Concomitant  treatment  with 
myelosuppressive medicinal products and those known to cause infections are major contributing factors 
and patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myelosuppression and infection 
(see SmPC sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Regarding the above mentioned sudden death, the Applicant considered metabolic disorders as the likely 
cause of death even though the autopsy report revealed the presence of liver steatosis. As a toxic reaction 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 118/132 
  
  
 
to  treatment  cannot  be  excluded,  the  Applicant  correctly  considered  the  event  possibly  related  to 
recombinant asparaginase. 
Most of the patients across clinical studies had alteration in laboratory values. Most were expected and 
could be attributed to the underlying medical condition or concurrently administered treatments, some 
known to be associated with significant toxicity. The high incidence of patients administered recombinant 
asparaginase experiencing an increase of at least 1 CTCAE grade of hyperglycaemia during the induction 
phase (31.2% vs. 14.9%) was particularly conspicuous. Although hyperglycaemia events are known to 
occur in patients administered asparaginases, the reasons for the sizeable discrepancy between study 
arms remains unclear. It is however noted that the majority of the events were grade I events and that 
a large proportion of both groups at baseline met the criteria for grade I hyperglycaemia. Given these 
factors and that the events were expected, inclusion of this ADR in the SmPC is considered to be sufficient 
as regards risk mitigation.  
Considering the safety profile of Spectrila, before initiating therapy bilirubin, hepatic transaminases and 
coagulation parameters (e.g. partial thromboplastin time [PTT], prothrombin time [PT], antithrombin III 
and fibrinogen) should be determined. After administration of any asparaginase preparation, close 
monitoring of bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, blood/urinary glucose, coagulation parameters (e.g. PTT, 
PT, antithrombin III, fibrinogen and D-dimer), amylase, lipase, triglycerides and cholesterol is 
recommended (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Limited data are available in adult patients, particularly those older than 65 years (see RMP). 
Qualitatively, the same asparaginase-induced adverse drug reactions are observed in adults and children; 
however, some of these undesirable effects (e.g. thromboembolic events) are known to occur with a 
higher frequency in adult patients compared to the paediatric population. Because of a higher frequency 
of comorbidities such as liver and/or renal impairment, patients > 55 years of age usually tolerate 
asparaginase treatment worse than paediatric patients (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Considering the limited data in adults, a single arm PK, PD, safety and immunogenicity study in adult de 
novo ALL patients will be conducted by the applicant (see RMP). The protocol will be submitted for CHMP 
review  no later than  3  months  after  the  Marketing Authorisation  is granted. Analyses  of  spontaneous 
reports from adults will also occur and be reported in PSURs. 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception and avoid becoming pregnant while 
being treated with asparaginase-containing chemotherapy. Since an indirect interaction between 
components of the oral contraception and asparaginase cannot be ruled out, oral contraceptives are not 
considered sufficiently safe in such clinical situation. A method other than oral contraceptives should be 
used in women of childbearing potential. Effective contraception must be used during treatment and for 
at least 3 months after asparaginase discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Men should use effective contraceptive measures and be advised to not father a child while receiving 
asparaginase. The time period following treatment with asparaginase when it is safe to become pregnant 
or father a child is unknown. As a precautionary measure it is recommended to wait for three months after 
completion of treatment. However, treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents should also be taken 
into consideration (see SmPC section 4.6). 
There are no data on the use of asparaginase in pregnant women. No reproduction studies in animals with 
asparaginase were performed but studies with asparaginase preparations in mice, rats, chicken and 
rabbits have shown embryotoxic and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). Based on results from animal 
studies and its mechanism of action, Spectrila should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the woman requires treatment with asparaginase (see section 4.6). 
Assessment report

Page 119/132 
  
  
 
It is unknown whether asparaginase is excreted into human breast milk. Because potential serious 
adverse reactions may occur in nursing infants, Spectrila should be discontinued during breast-feeding 
(see section 4.6). 
No human data on the effect of asparaginase on fertility are available (see SmPC section 4.6). 
Safety of Spectrila have not been established in Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Spectrila has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines, especially through its potential 
effects on the nervous and gastrointestinal systems (see section 4.8).  
No case of asparaginase overdose with clinical symptoms has been reported. There is no specific antidote. 
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Since no data are available on the intramuscular route and extrapolation from intravenous use to the 
intramuscular route, especially as regards immunogenicity, has not been adequately justified, no 
recommendation can be made on the intramuscular administration at this stage. Off-label use via 
intramuscular administration has been included in the RMP as potential safety concern. 
Overall, the guidance provided in the SmPC guideline has been adequately followed with regard to 
addressing the issue of causality and ADRs and relevant ADRs have been included in the SmPC section 
4.8. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data provided by the applicant is considered sufficient to characterise the safety profile of 
Spectrila. The profile of adverse effects of recombinant asparaginase was broadly similar to that of 
asparaginase medac. The most common side effects are hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycaemia, 
hypoalbuminaemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, oedema, fatigue, and change in 
laboratory parameters (e.g. transaminases, bilirubin, blood lipids and coagulation parameters).  
To further characterise the safety of Spectrila in adults a single arm PK, PD, safety and immunogenicity 
study in adult de novo ALL patients will be conducted by the applicant (see RMP).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that studies MC-ASP.4/ALL, MC-ASP.5/ALL, and MC-ASP.6/INF, which are 
contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan, P/0084/2013 and were completed after 26 January 
2007, are considered as significant. 
The assessment criteria for significance of studies as defined in Section III, Title 4.2 of the Europe 
Commission Communication – “Guideline on the format and content of applications for agreement or 
modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning the 
operation of the compliance check and on criteria for assessing significant studies (2014/C 338/01)” has 
been fulfilled, taking into account the following: 
Studies MC-ASP.5/ALL and MC-ASP.4/ALL are both comparative efficacy studies: Study MC-ASP.5/ALL 
was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group phase III study designed 
to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant L-asparaginase in comparison to Asparaginase medac 
during treatment of children with de novo ALL; Study MC-ASP.4/ALL was a single-centre, randomised, 
double-blind, parallel group phase II clinical trial to compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, 
efficacy, and safety of recombinant ASNase versus Asparaginase medac during induction treatment in 
children with de novo ALL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 124/132 
  
  
 
 
In addition, study MC-ASP.6/INF, a non-controlled multicentre phase II study of recombinant 
asparaginase for first-line treatment in infants (< 1 year of age at diagnosis) with de novo ALL, provided 
meaningful pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters were the main outcome measures in support of 
the clinical efficacy. Recombinant asparaginase (Spectrila) was compared to asparaginase medac in two 
pivotal trials, a phase III study (MC-ASP.5/ALL) and a phase II pharmacokinetics study (MC-ASP.4/ALL) 
in children with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Supportive data were available from 
two additional pharmacokinetic studies in patients with relapsed haematological neoplasias 
(MC-ASP.2/RHN), in adult patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (MC-ASP.1/ALL) and one 
efficacy study in infants with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (MC-ASP.6/INF). 
Data from all clinical studies with intravenous recombinant asparaginase showed swift, sustained and 
complete reductions in serum and CSF asparagine. In the main study MC-ASP.5/ALL, complete 
asparaginase depletion in serum was 94.9% in the rASNase arm versus 94.1% in the asparaginase medac 
arm and the confidence intervals for the risk difference fell entirely within the predefined interval of 
[-10%, 10%]: 0.8% [-6.25%; 8.04%], p-value= 0.0028.  
The pivotal study data on asparagine depletion were supported by slight decreases in serum glutamine 
levels and increases in serum aspartic acid and by observed mean serum trough asparaginase activities 
>100 U/L, which is used in clinical practice as the threshold level for assuring complete asparaginase 
depletion in serum and CSF in patients.  
Data from study MC-ASP.5/ALL were also presented where the observed changes in the serum amino acid 
concentrations were similar in both asparaginase study arms. Comparable trends were additionally 
observed in study MC-ASP.4/ALL, with the exception of glutamine levels both in CSF and serum.   
With regards to efficacy endpoints, most patients achieved complete remission (91.8% in the rASNase 
arm versus 96% in ASNas medac arm) and relapse- and event-free survival rates were high (96.9% at 12 
months and 96.9% at 24 months for rASNase versus 100% and 96.4% for ASNase medac respectively) 
as expected for current treatment protocols for paediatric ALL in which asparaginase is administered. 
Overall, rates were similar between the study arms of the pivotal and PK studies. In the small study in 
infants all patients had complete remission after induction treatment and almost all had achieved a 
positive MRD status. For adults, the survival and relapse data could not be interpreted as patient numbers 
were too low.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 125/132 
  
  
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Within the pivotal and supportive studies, whilst the data for the primary and secondary PD outcomes 
appeared broadly similar, there were signals in the PK and PD data which suggested that as treatment 
continued there was a trend to better outcome, even though small, with asparaginase medac treatment 
compared to treatment with recombinant asparaginase. A potential source of the differences is the large 
difference in aggregate component between the comparator products, (asparaginase medac 20.5% vs. 
recombinant asparaginase 0.36%). Available data suggest that the aggregates are associated with higher 
enzymatic activity than the tetramers within the product; hence, the activity of asparaginase medac could 
be expected to be higher. Additional PK and PD data submitted could not be considered robust and trends 
to  slightly  better  efficacy  seen  in  patients  administered  asparaginase  medac  were  considered  by  the 
CHMP to be of relatively low importance.  
Limited data were presented in certain populations and settings with the use of Spectrila. These include 
use in adults, infants and relapsed disease and use of other asparaginases after allergic/ hypersensitivity 
reaction to recombinant asparaginase. However, considering available post marketing information and 
the  clinical  experience  with  the  use  of  asparaginases  in  treatment  protocols  for  these  groups,  it  is 
considered available safety and efficacy data may be extrapolated to adults, infants and post-induction 
settings.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  will  undertake  further  evaluation  of  PK,  PD  and  safety  (including 
immunogenicity) in adults (see RMP).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The profile of adverse effects of recombinant asparaginase was broadly similar to that of asparaginase 
medac. Events of thrombosis, pancreatitis, infection and liver function changes were assessed and no 
notable differences were indicated. The main adverse events of interest are the formation of anti-drug 
antibodies  and  allergic/hypersensitivity  reactions.  Approximately  50%  of  patients  had  developed 
antibodies by the end of the asparaginase induction treatment in the pivotal study, with approximately 
half developing concomitant decrease in asparaginase activity, suggesting the presence of neutralising 
ADAs. There were no clear differences seen between study arms for these safety endpoints. This was also 
the case for the post induction phase, although data were limited.    
Data on allergic reactions, which included all allergic reactions occurring within the 24  hours  after  an 
infusion were provided and suggested a slightly lower proportion of patients suffering allergic reactions in 
the recombinant asparaginase arm (18% vs 25%) during the induction phase. Overall, the incidence of 
allergic  reactions  in  both  study  arms  were  significantly  increased  when  compared  to  the  protocol 
mandated analysis which restricted evaluation to any allergic reaction event occurring within 12 hours of 
study drug administration.  
Hypersensitivity reactions were similar between both arms with an incidence of approximately 36-39%. 
The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions together with the efficacy of rASNase were also assessed in 12 
infants  patients  (≤ 1  year)  in  the  uncontrolled  phase  II  study,  MC-ASP.6/INF.  Silent  inactivation  was 
reported in 4 out of the 12 enrolled patients (33%), even though no ADAs were detected in any patients. 
Asparaginase  activity  levels  lower  than  that  postulated  to  assure  complete  asparagine  depletion  (100 
U/L) were detected at some time points in all patients but one, with a higher than expected variability 
between patients. Nevertheless, complete asparaginase depletion was obtained in all but one patient.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  anti-drug  antibody  assay  was  reasonably  well  performed,  although  it  has  some  limitations.  In 
particular, it cannot be excluded that the ADA assay underestimates the incidence and titre of ADAs due 
to  interference  with  ADA  determination  by  asparaginase.  Decreased  asparaginase  activity  has  been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015 
Page 126/132 
  
  
 
included as an important identified risk in the RMP. Furthermore, treatment may be monitored based on 
the  trough  serum  asparaginase  activity  measured  three  days  after  administration  of  Spectrila.    If 
asparaginase activity values fail to reach target levels, a switch to a different asparaginase preparation 
could be considered (see SmPC section 4.4). 
There are few safety data available in adults from the development programme. Generally, response and 
survival outcomes in adults do not approximate those in children and tolerability of paediatric doses of 
asparaginase  is  poor  due  to  adverse  effects.  The  SmPC  reflects  how  the  safety  profiles  in  adults  and 
children differ (see SmPC section 4.8). Further evaluation of PK, PD and safety in adults will be conducted 
post-authorisation (see RMP). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Complete asparagine depletion is considered as a valid surrogate for clinical efficacy of asparaginases and 
was considered an adequate endpoint to compare Spectrila with ASNase medac. Asparagine levels 
decreased after the first dose of either ASNase preparation and remained depleted until end of ASNase 
treatment. Non-inferiority of Spectrila to asparaginase medac has been shown on the basis of 
asparaginase depletion. 
Although lower ASNase activity was observed for Spectrila versus ASNase medac, ASNase trough serum 
activity levels as low as 10-20 U/L led to complete ASN depletion in serum and CSF based on the provided 
data and supporting literature data showed that lower levels than 100 IU/L are sufficient (Boos et al. 1996 
(BFM group); Rizzari et al. 2000 (AIEOP group); Wetzler et al. 2007 (CALGB)). 
The profile of adverse effects of recombinant asparaginase was broadly similar to that of asparaginase 
medac and all important identified and potential risks have been adequately addressed in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  Spectrila  as  a  component  of  antineoplastic  combination  therapy  for  the 
treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years and adults 
is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Non-inferiority of Spectrila to asparaginase medac was shown on the basis of asparaginase depletion.    
Very few clinical efficacy data are available in adult ALL patients treated with recombinant asparaginase, 
as  the  adult  studies  were  terminated  early.  However,  given  that  the  experience  with  the  use  of 
asparaginases in the adult ALL population and that any PK and PD differences seen between test and 
reference products in children are not expected to differ significantly from those that might occur in adults 
given similar doses, the use of Spectrila can be extended to adults. PK, PD, safety and immunogenicity 
data will be collected post-approval in a single-arm adult de novo ALL patients study (see RMP).  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Spectrila is not similar to Atriance (nelarabine), Evoltra

appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Spectrila as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy for the

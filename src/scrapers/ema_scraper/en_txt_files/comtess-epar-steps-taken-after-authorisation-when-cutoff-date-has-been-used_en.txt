The CPMP during its meeting on 20-22 October 1998, concluded that the occurrence of hepatic 
abnormalities (hepatitis, jaundice, increased AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin) must 
be closely reported in the forthcoming Periodic Safety Update Report. 
The  MAH  submitted  a  Type  I  variation  introducing  an  increase  in  the  batch  size  of  crude 
entacapone. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) received a positive notification from 
the EMEA on 22 October 1998. This variation did not require amendments to the Community 
Marketing Authorisation. 
The  MAH  submitted  on  9  November  1998  a  request  concerning  changes  to  an  aspect  of  the 
Labelling not connected to the Summary of Product Characteristics. These changes refer to an 
update in the details of local contact representatives. The MAH received a positive notification 
from the EMEA on 13 November 1998. The package leaflet has been revised accordingly in all 
11 European Union official languages. 
Following  the  recommendations  made  during  the  October  CPMP  meeting  and  given  the 
suspension of  the  marketing authorisation  of another  COMT inhibitor, tolcapone (Tasmar)  on 
12  November  1998  due  to  increasing  concerns  over  reports  of  severe  hepatotoxicity  (Press 
Release dated 15 October 1998 and 17 November 1988), and the common mechanism of action 
of entacapone and tolcapone, the MAH was invited by the EMEA to give an oral explanation on 
the safety data of entacapone. These data have been reviewed by the plenary CPMP meeting on 
18 November 1998. The updated safety information indicates that entacapone does not appear 
to be hepatotoxic, although rare reports of clinically significant increases in liver enzymes have 
been reported. Nevertheless due to the awareness that abrupt withdrawal of COMT inhibition or 
dopaminergic containing medicinal products have resulted in Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 
(NMS)  in  a  rare  number  of  cases  and  knowing  that  rhabdomyolysis  secondary  to  severe 
dyskinesia  and  NMS  have  also  been rarely  observed  in  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease,  the 
MAH  considered  it  appropriate  to  introduce  on  19  November  1998  provisional  changes  to 
prescribing and patient information through an urgent procedure, although these adverse events 
have  not  been  reported  with  entacapone.  The  following  changes  were  introduced  through  an 
Urgent Safety Restriction that has been finalised on 20 November 1998: 
a) 
b) 
amendment  of  section  4.3  of  the  SPC  to  include  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  a 
previous history of NMS and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. 
amendment  of  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  to  include  the  possibility  of  NMS,  including 
rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia.  
The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  has  been  amended  accordingly.  The  plenary  CPMP  on 
20  November  1998  adopted  a  revised  provisional  SPC, Package  Information  Leaflet  and  was 
informed  on  the  information  (“Dear  Doctor  letter”)  that  the  MAH  will  send  out  to  health 
professionals in the European Union. 
In follow up to the USR, the MAH submitted a Type II variation in accordance with European 
Commission regulation (EC) No 542/95 on 25 November 1998. The CPMP adopted a positive 
opinion on the application on 17 December 1998 and the respective Commission decision was 
issued on 18 May 1999. 
On  10  December  1998,  the  MAH  applied  for  a  Type  I  variations,  in  accordance  with 
Commission Regulation (EC) 542/95 as amended, to increase the batch size of entacapone and 
to  amend  the  stages  carried  out  by  the  manufacturers  of  the  active  substance.  On  3 February 
1999 the EMEA issued the corresponding notification.  
A Type I variation to change the shape of the HDPE bottle was submitted on 18 January 1999. 
The corresponding notification was issued by the EMEA on 8 February 1999. 
The  MAH  submitted  on  3  March  1999  a  request  to  introduce  changes  to  an  aspect  of  the 
Labelling not connected to the SPC, in accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive No

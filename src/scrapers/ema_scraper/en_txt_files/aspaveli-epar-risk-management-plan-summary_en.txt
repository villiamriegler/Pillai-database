Summary of risk management plan for Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Aspaveli. The RMP details 
important risks of Aspaveli, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Aspaveli’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Aspaveli’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Aspaveli should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Aspaveli should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Aspaveli’s RMP. 
I  The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Aspaveli is authorised for PNH (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains pegcetacoplan 
as the active substance, and it is given by subcutaneous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Aspaveli’s benefits can be found in Aspaveli’s 
European Public Assessment Report, including in its plain-language summary, available on 
the European Medicines Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage.

II  Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Aspaveli, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Aspaveli's risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:  
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size—the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; and 
•  The medicine’s legal status—the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Aspaveli, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks and are listed below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Aspaveli is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Aspaveli are risks that need risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Aspaveli. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible according to available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important potential risk 1: Serious infections  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Inhibition of components of the complement system, including C3, might 
decrease innate immunity to encapsulated bacteria. This potentially 
increases the risk of serious infections from these bacteria in patients 
treated with pegcetacoplan. Studies have identified increased susceptibility 
to infection caused by encapsulated organisms as a key clinical 
consequence of congenital complement deficiency. Specifically, deficiency 
of C3 and its regulators (factor H and factor I) has been associated with 
severe recurrent bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis 
There have been no reports of serious infections with documented 
encapsulated bacteria attributable to pegcetacoplan through 334.5 person-
years of systemic pegcetacoplan exposure.  
Therefore, the available safety data from the PNH patient studies do not 
make serious infections an identified risk at the present time.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
1.  Unvaccinated patients or patients who do not maintain sufficient 
antibodies to the vaccines given before or during treatment might have 
a higher risk of infection due to encapsulated bacteria. 
2.  Patients with PNH-associated bone marrow failure (including aplastic 
anaemia PNH, myelodysplastic syndrome) have a higher risk of 
serious infection due to neutropenia 
3.  For patients who had solid organ (renal) or bone marrow transplants, 
receiving immunosuppressive treatment (eg, high-dose steroids, 
mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus) is a risk factor 
Individuals exposed to certain bacteria through work or travel might 
have a higher risk of infection. Groups at risk may include day-care 
workers, laboratory workers, military personnel, and other individuals 
with heightened levels of exposure to pathogenic bacteria.

Important potential risk 2: Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
There was one report of serious hypersensitivity in Study 204. This moderate 
SAE of hypersensitivity was deemed related to pegcetacoplan by the 
investigator. The event, which occurred on Day 1 (ie, the subject’s first day of 
dosing), led to the subject’s discontinuation from the study. The subject was 
negative for anti–pegcetacoplan peptide antibody response on Day 1.  
One subject (Study APL2-204) had a mild TEAE of maculopapular rash 
deemed related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator. This event was temporally 
associated with positive serum anti-PEG antibodies but not anti–pegcetacoplan 
peptide antibodies. The rash subsequently resolved, and anti-PEG serology 
became negative despite uninterrupted treatment with pegcetacoplan. 
These 2 cases of hypersensitivity were treated and resolved. One subject in 
Study APL2-302 had an SAE of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The absence of 
documented alternative explanations for the event of pneumonitis, as well as 
the subject’s recovery after stopping pegcetacoplan, led the company to 
conclude that this event might have been treatment related. However, 
idiopathic interstitial lung disease is an alternative possibility. A review of 
nonclinical data from studies of pegcetacoplan did not reveal any specific risks 
for pulmonary hypersensitivity. In Study APL2-302, there was also one 
moderate SAE of allergy to immunoglobulin therapy, from which the subject 
recovered, and was considered to be unrelated to pegcetacoplan by the 
investigator.  
Injection site reactions were frequently reported, although none was severe or 
serious and treatment continued in all subjects without sequelae.  
The risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions is a theoretical potential risk 
because of the mechanism of action of pegcetacoplan and reports on potential 
for immunogenicity from PEG. 
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to PEG are considered to have an 
increased risk of being hypersensitive to pegcetacoplan. 
In the pegcetacoplan clinical development programme, the immunogenicity 
potential of pegcetacoplan was assessed by evaluation of samples using 
validated assays for assessment of anti–pegcetacoplan peptide antibody and 
anti-PEG antibody in human serum samples. There was no apparent correlation 
of antibody development to altered pharmacokinetic profile. There has been no 
observed correlation of antidrug antibody development to clinical response or 
AEs in healthy subjects or subjects with PNH.

Important potential risk 3: Intravascular haemolysis after drug discontinuation (PNH) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
The PNH disease process and mechanism of control for it by complement 
inhibition is the source of this risk. Inhibition of complement C3 protects 
circulating red blood cells, produced by mutant stem-cell clones, from 
haemolysis. Discontinuation of treatment risks acute haemolytic crisis 
because of these red blood cells becoming vulnerable to destruction in 
patients with PNH. Hemolysis occurring in study subjects after sudden 
pegcetacoplan withdrawal has been observed. 
Patients with PNH who are being treated with a complement inhibitor and 
who have not been established on an effective alternative therapy at the 
time of discontinuation of a complement inhibitor are at higher risk for 
IVH after drug discontinuation.

Known potential of all medicinal products and on the class effect of all 
therapeutic proteins. No significant data have been identified for risk 
factors for immunogenicity in patients with PNH, neither within the 
conducted clinical trials for PNH nor identified in further publicly available 
articles or literature related to immunogenicity or antibodies to drug.  
In the pegcetacoplan clinical development programme, the immunogenicity 
potential of pegcetacoplan was assessed by evaluation of samples using 
validated assays for assessment of anti–pegcetacoplan peptide antibody and 
anti-PEG antibody in human serum samples. There was no apparent 
correlation of antibody development to altered pharmacokinetic profile. 
There has been no observed correlation of antidrug antibody development 
to clinical response or AEs in healthy subjects or subjects with PNH.

Important potential risk 5: Malignancies and haematologic abnormalities 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Prior experience of PNH patients treated with C5 inhibitors and review of 
published data describing the risk of malignancies and haematologic 
abnormalities in patients with congenital complement deficiencies is the 
main reason for including this as an important potential risk.

Important potential risk 6: Potential long-term effects of PEG accumulation 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Preclinical findings from nonclinical studies of pegcetacoplan in rabbits 
and monkeys are the main reason for including this as an important 
potential risk.  
In general, PEG-associated cytoplasmic vacuolation has been considered an 
adaptive tissue response to long-chain PEG, which is widely considered a 
nonadverse finding, if not accompanied by evidence of cellular distortion, 
necrosis, degeneration, inflammation, or disturbed body function. The only 
exception is represented by the kidney, in which epithelial degeneration 
was observed. Short-term safety of PEG has been studied extensively 
without identification of toxicity beyond reports of renal tubular cell 
vacuolation and degeneration at very high dose levels. In some instances, 
vacuolation was significant, thus leading to tissue distortion, but yet 
without demonstrated adverse functional outcomes.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
None identified.

Other Studies in Postauthorisation Development Plan 
Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) of Pegcetacoplan in Patients with PNH 
This is a multinational, multicentre, observational PASS to assess the long-term safety of 
pegcetacoplan in a real-world setting. The purpose of this study is to gain more data on the long-
term safety profile of pegcetacoplan and evaluate if the use of pegcetacoplan in adult patients with 
PNH increases the risk of certain adverse outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to 
evaluate the occurrence of serious infections in patients with PNH treated with pegcetacoplan. 
Patients will be recruited through the IPIG registry. Patients with PNH confirmed by high-
sensitivity flow cytometry and who initiate pegcetacoplan treatment for the first time will be 
included in the study at the time of treatment initiation. This study is observational and will not 
affect the patient and investigator relationship, nor influence the investigator’s drug prescription or 
therapeutic management of the patient. The decision to treat patients with pegcetacoplan will be 
independent from the decision to enrol patients in the study.  
Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) for Assessment of pregnancy outcomes in 
patients with PNH exposed to pegcetacoplan during pregnancy 
This is a multinational, multicentre, observational PASS to collect and evaluate data on pregnancy 
outcomes and on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the offspring of women exposed to 
pegcetacoplan during pregnancy. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of 
foetal deaths/stillbirths among pregnancy outcomes in patients treated with pegcetacoplan. 
Patients will be recruited through the IPIG registry. This study is observational and will not affect 
the patient/investigator relationship, nor influence the investigator’s drug prescription or 
therapeutic management of the patient. The decision to treat patients with pegcetacoplan will be 
independent from the decision to enrol patients in the study. 
An Open-Label, Nonrandomized, Multicenter Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-
Term Safety and Efficacy of Pegcetacoplan in the Treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal 
Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 
An open-label, nonrandomised, multicentre extension Phase 3 long-term extension study for 
patients with PNH (Study 307). This extension study protocol was developed to continue 
evaluation of the long-term safety and efficacy of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH. The 
objectives of this study are to establish the long-term safety of pegcetacoplan in subjects with 
PNH and to establish the long-term efficacy of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH. Subjects 
who have completed other pegcetacoplan PNH clinical trials are eligible to participate in this 
trial.

Introduction 
On  February  2015,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Rasilez  (aliskiren),  in 
accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  A  short  critical  expert 
overview has also been provided. 
Prevalence  of  hypertension  in  children  has  been  increasing  worldwide  driven  by  the  increasing 
prevalence of childhood obesity (Din-Dzietham et al, 2007, Flynn, 2008). Hypertension in children and 
adolescents is defined as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that 
is  ≥  95th  percentile  for  gender,  age,  and  height  on  at  least  three  separate  occasions  (NHBPEP  4th 
Report, 2004). Primary (essential) hypertension in children is usually associated with a positive family 
history  of  hypertension  or  cardiovascular  disease,  and  clusters  with  other  cardiovascular  disease  risk 
factors or comorbidities including obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Renal parenchymal and 
renovascular diseases are the most common causes of secondary hypertension in children (Riley et al, 
2012).  
The  renin  angiotensin  aldosterone  system  (RAAS)  plays  a  major  role  in  the  regulation  of  blood 
pressure (BP) and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to a 
decrease  in  circulating  volume  and  BP.  It  cleaves  the  substrate  angiotensinogen  to  form  the  inactive 
decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Angiotensin I is converted to the active octapeptide Angiotensin II 
(Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II interacts with cellular receptors (Ang 
II  receptors)  and  through  different  mechanisms  increases  total  peripheral  resistance,  resulting  in  the 
elevation of BP. 
Blocking  the  RAAS  with  an  ACE  inhibitor  (ACEI)  or  Angiotensin  II  receptor  blocker  (ARB)  has  been 
commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of patients, including children, with hypertension 
(Chu  et  al,  2014).  An  alternative  approach  to  blockade  of  the  RAAS  is  inhibition  of  renin,  the  rate 
limiting enzyme for the formation of Ang II. Aliskiren (SPP100) is the first in class, orally active, non-
peptide, specific direct renin inhibitor and blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I.  
It is approved in EU for treatment of hypertension in adults. 
Information on the development program 
Aliskiren’s  safety  and  efficacy  are  well  established  in  adults  and  it  is  approved  for  treatment  of 
hypertension in adults, except in patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and are receiving an ACEI 
or  an  ARB  [aliskiren  Investigator  Brochure,  edition  16].  The  study  CSPP100A2365  was  designed  to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of aliskiren in the pediatric population aged 6-17 years.  
The MAH stated that study title and number is part of a clinical development program.  
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
The investigational drug (SPP100, aliskiren) was provided by Novartis Drug Supply Management (DSM) 
equaling 6.25 mg/37.5 mg/150 mg dosage strengths.

CSPP100A2365  -  A  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  8  week  study  to  evaluate  the  dose 
response, efficacy and safety of aliskiren in peadiatric hypertensive patients 6-17 years of age. 
The  study  CSPP100A2365  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  8-week  study  in  pediatric 
hypertensive patients with ages 6-17 years. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objectives of this study were: 
- In Phase 1 (dose response phase), to evaluate the dose response of aliskiren in mean sitting systolic 
blood pressure (msSBP) change at end of Phase 1, from the baseline to Week 4, as measured by office 
BP.  
-  In  Phase  2  (placebo-controlled  withdrawal  phase),  to  evaluate  pooled  treatment  effect  of  aliskiren 
(mid and high doses) in msSBP change at end of Phase 2, from the end of Phase 1 (at the beginning of 
Week 5),compared to placebo pooled from corresponding arms, as measured by office BP. 
The  secondary  objectives  of  this  study  were  the  followings:  safety  and  tolerability  of  aliskiren,  dose 
response  of  aliskiren  in  mean  sitting  diastolic  blood  pressure  (msDBP,  office  BP),  effect  of  aliskiren 
(mid and high doses) in msDBP change compared to placebo, dose response of aliskiren in calculated 
mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP,  office  BP),  treatment  effect  of  aliskiren  (mid  and  high  doses)  in 
calculated  MAP  change  compared  to  placebo,  the  rate  of  positive  treatment  response  by  dose  group 
(positive response = msSBP < 95th percentile or a 7 mmHg decrease in msSBP from the baseline), the 
effect  of  aliskiren  on  the  24  hour  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring  (ABPM)  with  focus  on  mean 
systolic and diastolic ABPM, daytime and nighttime ABPM, dipper vs. non-dipper pattern (nondipper = 
< 10% decline in nighttime mean vs. the daytime mean in ABPM). 
The exploratory objectives  of  this study were the followings: the relationship between change in  PRA 
and the dose of aliskiren, the relationship between change in PRA from baseline at the end of Phase 1 
and age, the relationship between baseline PRA, disease factors and BP response, age and dose. 
Patients  successfully  completing  this  study  were  offered  to  participate  in  a  52-week,  double-blind, 
randomized  extension  study  (CSPP100A2365E1)  aimed  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety,  tolerability 
and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril. 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 8-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
aliskiren  in  pediatric  hypertensive  patients  6-17  years  of  age.  The  study  consisted  of  3  phases  as 
defined below (Figure 9-1): 
- Screening phase:  A single-blind placebo wash-out for up to a maximum of three weeks (21 
days). 
- Phase 1: A four week (28 day) randomized, double-blind dose-response phase consisting of 3 
aliskiren  dose  groups:  low  (6.25/12.5/25  mg),  mid  (37.5/75/150  mg),  and  high  dose  (150/300/600 
mg) according to weight. The dose ratio for all three dose groups were the same for the low-weight (≥ 
20  to  <  50  kg),  the  mid-weight  (≥  50  kg  to  <  80  kg)  and  the  high-weight  (≥  80  kg  to  ≤  150  kg) 
patients with a low: mid: high dose ratio of 1:6:24. Patients were stratified at baseline by weight (≥ 
20 to < 50 kg; ≥ 50 kg to < 80 kg and ≥ 80 kg to ≤150 kg), age (6-11 and 12-17 years old), region 
(US, EU and ROW, as applicable), and by hypertension etiology (primary vs. secondary). For Phase 1,

patients were randomized to aliskiren low, mid and high dosing groups in a 2:1:2 ratio and were dosed 
based on their weight category at randomization as shown in Table 9-1. 
- Phase 2: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase of up to four weeks 
(28 days). Patients either continued the aliskiren treatment assigned  during Phase I or were switched 
to placebo. 
The study design was discussed and agreed with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Pediatric 
Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as an adequate design to characterize the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  in  pediatric  patients.  The  study  follows  the  FDA  trial  design  C  which 
avoids use of a true placebo arm and ensures interpretability of results. A negative slope of the dose 
response phase would indicate that the study was successful (Pasquali et al, 2002). In case the dose 
response  phase  is  uninterpretable  (zero  slope,  drug  effective  at  all  studied  doses),  the  placebo-
controlled withdrawal phase would be used to help differentiate the efficacy of the drug. Study design 
C is the most commonly used trial design in pediatric hypertension (Benjamin et al, 2008). 
The  duration  of  the  dose  response  phase  (4  weeks)  was  based  on  data  from  studies  conducted  with 
aliskiren  in  adults  showing  that  a  substantial  proportion  (85%-90%)  of  the  BP  lowering  effect  was

observed within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment, and near-maximal effect was reached by 4 weeks. 
The duration of the placebo-controlled withdrawal phase (4 weeks) was based on the long half-life (34-
41 hours) of aliskiren and the results of  withdrawal trials in adults which showed that 60% of the BP 
reduction  effect  was  maintained  at  week  2  following  cessation  of  treatment  [aliskiren  Investigator 
Brochure, edition 16]. 
msSBP was the primary endpoint (and entry criteria) because systolic hypertension is more prevalent 
than  diastolic  hypertension  in  children.  Clinical  studies  indicate  that  SBP  change  is  often  better 
correlated with clinical outcome (cardiovascular mortality and morbidity) than DBP, although no such 
data  is  available  in  children.  Secondary  endpoints  included  msDBP,  MAP,  rates  of  responders  and 
ambulatory  blood  pressure  (mean  arterial  systolic  BP  [MASBP]  and  mean  arterial  diastolic  BP 
[MADBP]).  
Study population 
The study population consisted of approximately 275 male and female children, 6 to 17 years of age at 
randomization (Visit 2), with msSBP ≥ 95th percentile for age, gender and height measured by office 
BP. It was estimated that, at randomization: 
- at least 50% of patients would be 11 years old or younger 
- at least 10% of the patient population would have secondary hypertension by history 
- at least 80% of the patient population would be ≤ 100 kg. 
A  total  of  255  patients  were  expected  to  complete  Phase  1,  and  approximately  237  patients  were 
expected to complete Phase 2. 
Inclusion criteria were the followings:  
-  Male  or  female,  aged  6-17  years  with  a  documented  diagnosis  of  hypertension  as  defined  in  the 
NHBPEP 4th Report, 2004 (msSBP as mean of 3 measurements) must have been ≥ 95th percentile for 
age, gender and height, at Visit 2)  
- Weighed ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 150 kg at randomization (Visit 2) 
-  Were  able  to  safely  wash  out  prior  antihypertensive  therapy  for  a  minimum  of  7  days  if  already 
receiving treatment

- hypersensitivity to study medication or to any drug of similar chemical class. 
For detailed exclusion criteria, please refer to Appendix 16.1.1–Study Protocol–Section 5.2. 
Sample size 
For the analysis of Phase 1, a total sample size of 200 patients was required to provide at least 90% 
power  to  detect  a  non-zero  slope  of  0.239  for  change  from  baseline  in  msSBP  (mmHg)  as  a  linear 
function  of  aliskiren  dose  ratio  (1:6:24)  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.05.  This  calculation 
assumed a 2:1:2 patient allocation ratio to aliskiren low, mid and high dosing groups respectively. The 
(pooled) standard deviation from valsartan study CVAL489A2302 was estimated as 11 mm Hg, so this 
was  used  in  the  current  calculation.  A  slope  of  0.239  (mmHg  per  unit  increase  in  dose  ratio) 
corresponds to 5.5 mmHg reduction in SBP from low dose (6.25/12.5 mg) to high dose (150/600 mg). 
Considering  a  7%  dropout  rate,  a  total  of  216  patients  were  required  for  Phase  1  to  achieve  90%  
lower. 
For  the  analysis  of  Phase  2,  a  total  sample  size  of  237  patients  (with  1:1  patient  allocation  ratio  for 
placebo and aliskiren) was required to provide at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in 
change from end of Phase 1 in msSBP of 5.5 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg at a two-
sided significance level of 0.05. The standard deviations for the change from end of Phase 1 in mean 
sitting SBP for the primary and secondary hypertension groups  in the valsartan study CVAL489A2302 
were  estimated  as  9.40  mmHg  and  9.98  mmHg,  respectively.  The  standard  deviations  in  both 
hypertension  groups  were  smaller  than  the  standard  deviation  considered  in  this  calculation. 
Considering  a  7%  dropout  rate,  a  total  of  255  patients  were  required  for  Phase  2  to  achieve  90% 
power.  This  required  that  275  patients  be  entered  into  Phase  1,  so  that  the  expected  255  patients 
continued into Phase 2. 
The  sample  size of  275  patients  was  required  to  achieve  at  least 90% power  for  testing  the  primary 
hypothesis in each phase at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. It was expected that the proportion 
of  patients  with  primary  hypertension  would  be  at  least  60%,  so  based  on  the  assumptions  of  the 
standard deviation and treatment effects, the planned sample size of 275 randomized patients should 
result  in  at  least  90%  power  for  testing  the  primary  hypothesis  in  each  phase,  at  a  two-sided 
significance level of 0.05. 
Treatments 
The following study medications were provided in a double-blind fashion: 
- Investigational drug: SPP100 (aliskiren) 6.25, 37.5 mg and 150 mg  
- Control drug: placebo to SPP100 (aliskiren)

All test materials were supplied by Novartis Drug Supply Management (DSM).  
A dose ratio of 1:6:24 (low : mid : high) was selected to try to ensure no efficacy overlap between the 
three dose groups selected for this study, which has been shown to be a factor in the success of dose 
response trials of antihypertensive agents in a pediatric population (Benjamin et al, 2008). 
Aliskiren in adults was studied in doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg. Once daily doses of 
aliskiren  150  mg  and  300  mg  were  recommended  and  approved  for  use  as  monotherapy  or  in 
combination with other anti-hypertensive agents in adults [aliskiren Investigator Brochure, edition 16]. 
In addition, in study CSPP100A2256, doses of 2 and 6 mg/kg were studied in 39 hypertensive patients 
aged  6-17  years  with  results  showing  that  the  overall  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  findings  in  pediatric 
patients are similar to those seen in adults based on the body weight normalized plasma apparent total 
body clearance. As with adults, age, body weight, and gender appeared to have no significant effect on 
aliskiren  systemic  exposure.  The  exposure  levels  in  these  pediatric  patients  were  within  or  slightly 
below the exposure range found in adults. The aliskiren doses selected in study CSPP100A2365 (3.0-
7.5 mg/kg for high, 0.75-1.88 mg/kg for mid and 0.13-0.31 mg/kg for low dose groups) were selected 
with  the  intention  of  covering  a  wider  dose  range  from  a  highly  effective  dose  (inclusive  of  a  dose 
higher  than  that  used  in  adults  (i.e.  600mg)),  and  also  to  ensure  a  minimally  effective  dose.  This  is 
consistent with recommendations for dose response studies to include a low dose that is less than the 
lowest  approved  adult  dose  and  a  high  dose  that  is  at  least  two-fold  higher  than  the  maximum 
approved adult dose (Benjamin et al, 2008).  
A  modelling  and  simulation  analysis  was  done  on  interim  data  from  CSPP100A2256  to  predict  a  BP 
dose response in CSPP100A2365. Results showed that a dose response slope would be generated with 
mean SBP reductions of 7.3 mmHg, 10.2 mmHg and 13.6 mmHg for the low, medium and high dose 
groups, respectively. 
Treatment  blinding:  Patients,  investigator  staff,  persons  performing  the  assessments,  and  data 
analysts remained blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database 
lock, using the following methods: 
Instructions  for  prescribing  and  taking  study  treatment:  Patients  were  instructed  to  withhold  study 
medication on the day of their next clinic visit and to bring all remaining study medication to their next 
clinic visit. 
Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment: Study drug dose adjustments were 
not  permitted.  If  a  temporary  interruption  of  study  medication  occurred,  every  attempt  to  re-initiate 
study medication was made.  
Rescue medication: The use of rescue medication was not permitted in this study.  
Concomitant  treatment:  Use  of  the  following  treatments  was  not  allowed:  anti-hypertension  drugs, 
cyclosporine, Itraconazole, potassium sparing diuretics, and/or potassium supplement, MAO inhibitors. 
Uses  of  the  following  treatments  were  conditionally  permitted  after  the  start  of  the  washout  Period: 
chronic  use  of  NSAIDS/COX-2,  over  the  counter  decongestants,  stimulant  therapy  such  as 
methylphenidate  for  attention  deficit  disorder/attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder,  chronic  use  of 
steroids,  other  drugs  provided  the  need  for  such  medication(s)  was  a  continuation  of  a  need  that 
existed prior to entry into the study and the manner  in which the medication(s) were used remained 
essentially unchanged. 
Patients  were  not  discontinued  from  the  study  until  the  study  monitor  had  been  contacted.  The 
decision  to  discontinue  a  patient  who  had  taken  any  of  these  concomitant  medications  (with  the 
exception  of  cyclosporine  and  itraconazole)  was  evaluated  on  a  case  by  case  basis  by  Novartis  in 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

consultation  with  the  investigator.  Any  patient  who  had  taken  cyclosporine  or  itraconazole,  for  any 
indication, was to be discontinued immediately. 
Discontinuation  of  study  treatment  and  premature  patient  withdrawal:  Study  drug  was  discontinued 
(and  the  patient  withdrawn  from  the  trial)  if  the  investigator  determined  that  continuing  would  have 
resulted in a significant safety risk for that patient or if, on balance, he/she thought that continuation 
would have been detrimental to the patient’s wellbeing. 
The  following  circumstances  required  study  drug  discontinuation:  withdrawal  of  informed  consent, 
inability to discontinue prior antihypertensive therapy for a minimum of 7 days during the SB placebo 
run-in,  positive  pregnancy  test, lack  of  baseline  (Visit  2)  msSBP  measurement,  use  of  the  prohibited 
concomitant medication, emergence of adverse events (AEs). The list of AEs included the followings:: 
msSBP is  ≥ 25% above the 95th percentile  at any  time, symptomatic hypotension or msSBP ≤ 50th 
percentile for gender, age and height at any time, severe anemia defined as Hemoglobin < 8 gm/dL, 
severe  leucopenia  defined  as  WBC  <  3000/mm3,  pregnancy,  allergic  reaction  to  study  medication, 
protocol deviation resulting in significant risk, liver enzymes >3 times the upper limit of the reference 
range not due to viral hepatitis. 
Patients had the possibility to voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. 
Emergency unblinding did not occur in this study. 
Treatment  exposure  and  compliance:  Treatment  exposure  and  compliance  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator  and/or  study  personnel  at  each  visit  using  pill  counts  and  information  provided  by  the 
patient.

Office BP measurements were done using an automated BP monitoring device and calibrated regularly 
in accordance with the Guidelines for Management of Hypertension: Report of the fourth working party 
of  the  British  Hypertension  Society,  2004  –  BHS  IV  (Williams,  et  al  2004).  Post-dose  measurements 
were made at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post-dose), i.e. just prior to taking the daily dose of study 
medication.    The  measurements  were  done  using  the  non-dominant  arm;  however,  if  a  clinically-
relevant difference (≥ 10 mmHg in SBP and/or ≥ 5 mmHg in DBP) was noted between the two arms at 
study  entry,  the  arm  with  higher  BP  reading  was  used  for  subsequent  study  assessments.  The  arm 
used was documented in source documentation.  
Sitting  BP  was  measured  after  the  patient  had  been  sitting  for  5  minutes  and  the  average  of  three 
sitting BP measurements was used as the mean sitting office BP. Standing BP was measured only once

at each visit, after the patient had been standing for 3 minutes and within 3-5 minutes after the last 
sitting BP measurement. 
Self-measured blood pressure: At the first study visit all patients who were dispensed SB run-in study 
medication were also provided with an automated self-measuring BP device (SMBP). SMBP information 
was not analyzed. It was intended to be used as a guide to monitor the patient’s home BP throughout 
the course of the trial. 
Ambulatory  Blood  Pressure  Monitoring  (ABPM):  ABPM  assessments  were  anticipated  to  be  done  in  at 
least 50% of the randomized patient population. Patients at pre-selected sites had ABPM collected over 
a 24-hour period at  Visits 2, 4 and 6.  Following office  BP measurements, patients were instructed to 
wear  the  ABPM  device  for  24  hours.  The  ABPM  device  was  pre-set  to  collect  readings  every  20 
minutes. All ABPM readings remained blinded to the patients. 
Assessment  of  safety:  Safety  assessments  consisted  of  collecting  all  AEs,  including  serious  adverse 
events (SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug, and pregnancies. They also included 
the regular monitoring of laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) and regular 
assessments of vital signs, body height/weight and physical condition. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were 
performed at baseline (Visit 2) and Visit 6.  Echocardiography was offered to all patients at baseline, 
but  was  only  required  for  patient  with  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  (LVH).  Other  safety  assessments 
included  pregnancy  tests  at  screening,  baseline,  and  Visit  6,  Tanner  stages  evaluation  for  growth  at 
baseline and Visit 6. Neurocognitive assessment was performed at baseline for all patients and at Visit 
6  only  for  patients  who  discontinued  early  or  did  not  enter  the  extension  study.  Clinically  notable 
laboratory values were pre-defined. 
Drug concentration measurements: At Week 2 (Visit 3), PK blood samples were planned to be collected 
in  30 to  50%  of the  patient  population  at  a  random  time  point post  dose  for population  PK  analysis. 
One (1) fasting trough PK sample was planned to be collected from every patient at the completion of 
the dose-response phase (Week 4 (Visit 4)). 
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments: Biomarkers related to hypertension and renal functions 
were  collected.  These  included  markers  such  as  PRA,  plasma  renin  concentration  (PRC),  urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and Cystatin C.  
Data quality assurance – Monitoring: The responsibility for site monitoring resided with field monitors 
from Novartis or from Research Pharmaceutical Services Inc (RPS).  
Statistical Methods 
The randomized sets (RAN1 and RAN2) consisted of all patients who received a randomization number 
at respective phases. 
The full analysis sets (FAS1 and FAS2) consisted of all patients who were randomized into Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 respectively.  
The  per-protocol  sets  (PPS1  and  PPS2)  consisted  of  all  FAS  patients  who  completed  the  respective 
study phases without any major protocol deviations that impacted on efficacy assessment.  
The  safety  sets  (SAF1  and  SAF2)  consisted  of  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-
blind study drug at respective phases.  
The primary dose-response relationship was evaluated at the conclusion of Phase 1 and determined by 
the slope for change from baseline in msSBP. If the slope was statistically significant, then a difference 
among  the  doses  had  been  identified.  If  a  flat  dose-response  curve  was  found  (i.e.,  the  slope  is  not

statistically different than  zero), it would indicate  that  there are  no significant differences  among the 
aliskiren doses during the four weeks of treatment in Phase 1; then the analyses performed in Phase 2 
would  be  used  to  further  interpret  whether  there  is  an  effect  on  BP  due  to  placebo  wash-out.  The 
primary efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS1 and FAS2. Additional analyses were performed 
using  the  PPS1  and  PPS2.  The  analysis  results  in  Phase  2  were  used  to  evaluate  whether  there  is  a 
blood  pressure  effect  due  to  placebo  washout.  The  null  hypothesis  for  Phase  2  was  that  the  change 
from end of Phase 1 in msSBP was not different between the pooled aliskiren high and mid doses, and 
placebo  pooled  from  corresponding  arms  at  the  end  of  Phase  2.  An  ANCOVA  model  that  included 
treatment, weight, age strata, region, and hypertension status (primary vs. secondary) as factors and 
end of Phase 1 msSBP as a covariate, were carried out at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Summary of patient disposition for Phase 1 is presented in Table 10-1 and for Phase 2 in Table 10-2. A 
total of 268 patients were randomized in Phase 1 including 1 mis-randomized patient who did not take 
double blind medication and thus was not included in the safety (SAF1 and SAF2) or full analysis (FAS1 
and FAS2) sets. 
The majority of patients completed the study with 260 patients (97.0%) completing Phase 1 and 255 
patients  (98.1%)  completing  Phase  2.  The  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  any  reason  overall  during 
both  Phase  1  and  2  was  low  (4.5%),  generally  balanced  between  the  phases,  and  lower  than  the 
protocol projected discontinuation rate of 14%.  
In  Phase  1,  7  patients  (2.6%)  discontinued  from  the  study  (Table  10-1).  The  rate  of  discontinuation 
due to an AE was low with only 1 patient  discontinuing in the aliskiren high dose  group. This  patient 
discontinued the study medication on Day 1 due to an AE that started during the single-blind placebo 
wash-out (stomach cramping). 
Five  patients  (1.9%)  discontinued  from  Phase  2  (Table  10-2);  4  of  these  were  in  the  placebo  group 
and 1 in the aliskiren high dose group. Withdrawal of consent (0.8%) and AEs (0.8%) were the most 
common reasons for discontinuation (1 in the aliskiren high dose group and 1 in the placebo high dose 
group).

Patient  disposition  for  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  were  also  presented  by  region,  center,  and  treatment 
group.  
Patients  successfully  completing  this  study  were  offered  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  a  52-week, 
double-blind, randomized extension study (CSPP100A2365E1) aimed to evaluate the long-term safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril. A total of 208 of the 255 patients (81.6%) 
completing study CSPP100A2365 enrolled in CSPP100A2365E1. 
Protocol deviations are summarized for Phase 1 in Table 10-3 and for Phase 2 in Table 10-4. 
In Phase 1, protocol deviations occurred in 121 patients (45.1%) of the overall randomized population, 
and occurred more often in the low dose group than in the mid and high dose groups. The majority of 
the  reported  protocol  deviations  were  minor,  with  use  of  NSAIDS  and  visit  occurring  out  of  window 
being  the  most  commonly  reported  minor  protocol  deviations.  The  relatively  high  number  of  minor 
protocol  deviations  might  be  attributable  to  the  longer  than  expected  time  to  complete  the  study  (4 
years). 
Major  protocol  deviations  occurred  in  18  patients  (6.7%)  of  the  overall  randomized  population  that 
excluded  them  from  the  per-protocol  analysis.  The  most  common  major  protocol  deviation  was  BP 
measurement  collected  not  at  trough  in  6  patients  (2.2%)  followed  by  compliance  with  study 
medication less than 80% in Phase 1 in 5 patients (1.9%).

In Phase 2, protocol deviations occurred in 115 patients (44.2%) of the overall randomized population. 
Major  protocol  deviations  occurred  in  20  patients  (7.7%)  of  the  overall  randomized  population  that 
excluded  them  from  per-protocol  analysis.  Similar  to  Phase  1,  the  most  common  major  protocol 
deviation  was  BP  measurement  collected  not  at  trough  in  9  patients  (3.5%).  Five  patients  had 
compliance with study medication less than 80% in Phase 2. 
Baseline data 
The  key  baseline  demographic  and  background  characteristics  of  the  randomized  patients  in  Phase  1 
are  shown  in  Table  11-3.  Patients  in  the  three  treatment  groups  had  comparable  demographic  and 
baseline characteristics, including age, gender, race, weight,  and hypertension etiology. The majority 
of patients were male and Caucasian with a mean age of 11.8 years. 47.8% of patients were in the 6-
11 years age  group and 51.9% in the 12-17 years age  group.  53%  of the  patients were 12 years of 
age  or  younger.  There  were  30  (11.2%)  black  patients.  Forty-eight  patients  (17.9%)  had  secondary 
hypertension. Mean weight was 68.6 kg with 58.6% of patients having body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th 
percentile for age and gender.

Height  and  weight  were  reassessed  at  Visit  4  before  re-randomization  in  Phase  2  of  the  study  and 
considered  as  baseline  values  for  Phase  2.  The  overall  characteristics  for  patients  in  Phase  2  were 
comparable  to those  reported  for  the  full  patient  population  in  Phase  1.  As in  Phase  1,  there  was  no 
meaningful  difference  in  most  of  the  baseline  demographic  parameters  between  aliskiren  and 
corresponding placebo groups across dose groups in Phase 2, except in the distribution of weight, BMI 
and hypertension etiology. (Table 11-4).

Baseline BP levels were generally similar among the 6 treatment groups except for 3.4 mmHg higher 
baseline msSBP in the placebo mid dose group (compared to aliskiren mid dose group). (Table 11-6). 
Most  of  patients  had  at  least  one  co-morbidity  (metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  ,  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders,  surgical 
and  medical  procedures,  infections  and  infestations,  and  congenital,  familial,  and  genetic  disorders).  
Frequent conditions (≥ 10% of patients in any group) were obesity, asthma, headache, and seasonal 
allergy (Table 11-7). A total of 20.9% of patients had an abnormality in the renal or urinary SOC and 
20.1%  were  considered obese  by the  investigator  while  58.6%  had  baseline  BMI≥95th  percentile  for 
age and gender.

Efficacy results 
Primary objectives 
At  the  end  of  Phase  1,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  from  baseline  in  msSBP  in  all  3 
dose groups (p<0.001, Table 11-8). The reduction in msSBP was larger in the high dose group (-9.03 
mmHg) than in the low (-5.54 mmHg) and mid dose (-5.42 mmHg) groups. Similar results were seen 
in the PPS1 population (-5.61, -6.13 and -9.89 mmHg, respectively, Table 14.2-1.1a).

The primary efficacy slope analysis yielded a slope estimate of -0.17 (mmHg per unit increase in dose 
ratio  P<0.001)  for  the  dose-response  curve  for  change  from  baseline  to  end  of  Phase  1  in  msSBP 
(Table 11-9). Results were similar in the per protocol population (PPS1). 
The  reductions  in  msSBP  were  observed  as  early  as  Week  1  in  all  three  dose  groups.    Further 
reductions after Week 2 were seen with the high dose up to Week 4 (end of Phase 1).

A summary of the changes in msSBP from end of Phase 1 to the end of Phase 2 is presented in Table 
11-10. At the end of Phase 2, reductions in msSBP from end of Phase 1 were seen in all three aliskiren 
dose  groups  but  was  significant  in  the  aliskiren  mid  dose  group  only  (-2.59  mmHg,  p=0.028).  For 
patients  that  switched  to  placebo  in  Phase  2,  the  msSBP  change  from  Phase  1  end  was  an  increase 
only  in  the  placebo  high  dose  group  and  was  not  significant  (+1.11  mmHg,  P=0.354).  The  msSBP 
change  was a further decrease  in the placebo low  group  (-0.64 mmHg)  and  in the  placebo mid  dose 
group (-2.90 mmHg).  The decrease in msSBP of the placebo mid dose group was borderline significant 
(P=0.064) and actually numerically greater compared to the aliskiren mid dose group.  Similar results 
were seen with the PPS2 population. 
Between-group comparisons of msSBP changes from the end of Phase 1 to the end of Phase 2 for the 
3 different dose groups are shown in Table 11-12. The difference for the aliskiren high dose group as 
compared to placebo did not meet statistical significance (p=0.0563). The average differences between 
aliskiren and placebo for the low and mid dose groups were < 0.2 mmHg and not significant as well.

In pooled analyses for mid-high doses, the difference in msSBP change between aliskiren groups and 
placebo groups was not significant (Table 11-11). 
Subgroup analyses did not indicate clinically significant trends. 
Secondary objectives 
- msDBP: At the end of Phase 1, there was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in msDBP 
in all 3 dose groups (p<0.001) with a larger reduction observed with increasing aliskiren dose (-2.71 
mmHg,  -4.05  mmHg  and  -6.33  mmHg  for  the  low,  mid  and  high  dose  groups,  respectively).    The 
msDBP  slope  analysis  presented  in  Table  11-14  yielded  a  slope  estimate  of  -0.14  (mmHg  per  unit 
increase  in  dose  ratio)  for  the  dose-response  curve  for  change  from  baseline.    Between-group 
comparisons of msDBP changes from the end of Phase 1 to the end of Phase 2 between  aliskiren and 
placebo  did  not  meet  statistical  significance  in  analyses  separate  per  dose  and  in  pooled  analyses.  
Findings were similar for msMAP. 
- Responders: At the end of phase 2, the proportion of responders for msSBP was 26% higher in the 
aliskiren pooled group compared to the placebo pooled group (62/80 vs 45/73, P=0.038). 
-  ABPM:  A  total  of  152  patients  (56.7%)  were  included  in  final  analysis  for  ABPM.  All  three  aliskiren 
dose  group  showed  reductions  from  baseline  in  post-dosing  24-hour  mean  ambulatory  systolic  blood 
pressure (MASBP) at the end of Phase 1 (high group, mid group, and low group = -6.02, -6.01, and -
2.66 mmHg, respectively). The mid and high dose groups had similar MASBP reductions. The mid and 
high dose groups had statistically significant greater reductions than the low dose group (P<0.001). In 
pooled  analyses  for  all  doses,  the  difference  in  MASBP  change  between  aliskiren  groups  and  placebo 
groups  was  significant  (-2.86  mHg,  P=0.0022).  Results  were  similar  for  MADBP.  The  differences  in

MASBP  and  MADBP  associated  with  aliskiren  treatment  were  explained  by  differences  in  daytime  BP 
not in night time BP. 
UACR  levels  were  measured  for  all  patients  at  randomization.  For  patients  with  albuminuria,  testing 
was  also  done  at  Visit4  (end  of  Phase  1)  and  Visit  6  (end  of  Phase  2).  No  specific  trends  were  seen 
with  UACR  changes  at  end  of  Phase  1  or  Phase  2  (low  number  of  patients  with  albuminuria  at  
randomization and the uneven distribution of patients with albuminuria among the different treatment 
groups, Tables from 14.3-2.11 to 14.3-2.18). 
- PK: Weight-based dose of aliskiren significantly correlated with plasma levels of aliskiren. 
Safety results 
Duration of exposure was similar among groups of Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Table 12-1 and Table 12-2, 
respectively). 
Overall,  159  patients  (61.2%)  used  concomitant  medications.  The  most  commonly  used  concomitant 
medications were anilides (13.8%), other antihistamines for systemic use (10.8%) and selective beta-
2 adrenoceptor agonists (10.0%). 
Three patients (1.2%) required non-study antihypertensive medication after early discontinuation from 
the study. 
Newly occurring AEs were reported by 30.3% of patients in Phase 1 and 35.8% of patients in Phase 2 
(Tables 12-3 and 12-4). AEs were more common in the aliskiren high dose group.

The investigator defined as drug-related the AEs of 2 patients (0.7%) in Phase 1 and 3 patients (1.2%) 
in  Phase  2.  The  two  suspected  AEs  in  Phase  1  were  mild  hypotension  (aliskiren  high  dose,  resolved 
same days) and mild flatulence (aliskiren high dose, study drug interrupted for 1 day). In Phase 2, one

patient  (placebo  high  dose)  had  rash,  pruritus,  cough,  and  fever  that  led  to  study  discontinuation. 
Another patient (aliskiren low dose group) had headache (treated with acetaminophen and resolved in 
1 day). The third patient (placebo high dose group) had mild pharyngitis, treated with clarithromycin 
and resolved in 7 days). 
Analysis by hypertension etiology is summarized in Table 12-13. Patients with secondary hypertension 
had  higher  rate  of  AEs  compared  to  patients  with  primary  hypertension  in  both  phases  of  the  study 
(comorbidities more frequent in the secondary  hypertension). 
There  were  no  deaths  reported  in  the  study.  Serious  adverse  events  and  AEs  resulting  in  study 
discontinuation  are  summarized  in  Table  12-15  for Phase  1  and  Table  12-16 for  Phase  2.  No  patient 
discontinued the study prematurely due to a laboratory abnormality. 
Among the serious AEs, there was one patient with head injury (fall), one patient with headache and 
syncope,  and  one  patient  with  attempted  suicide.    None  of  these  event  was  considered  aliskiren-
related.

Three  patients  discontinued  the  treatment:  one  in  Phase  1  (stomach  cramping  during  placebo  run-in 
phase)  and  two  in  Phase  2  (the  patient  with  treatment-unrelated  attempted  suicide  and  another 
placebo-treated patient with rash-pruritus).  
Lab test 
No patient discontinued the study due to a lab abnormality. 
Small, insignificant changes in the hematology and biochemistry parameters were seen in both phases 
of the study.  The % of patients with notable changes in Phase 1 and 2 is shown in Table 12-20 and 
12-21, respectively. There was an increase in the proportion of patients with AST values above upper 
limit of normal (ULN) in the aliskiren mid dose group (7.8% to 19.6%) at end of Phase 1, but most of 
the patients returned to normal ranges by end of Phase  2 (3.3% on aliskiren mid dose  and 0.0% on 
placebo mid dose).

No specific trends were seen with UACR changes at end of Phase 1 or Phase 2 (low number of patients 
with albuminuria at randomization and the uneven distribution of patients with albuminuria among the 
different treatment groups).

Vital signs 
Slight changes in body weight were observed at end of Phase 1 (0.3 to 0.5 Kg) and at end of Phase 2 
(0.0 to 0.5 Kg).  
There were no meaningful changes in sitting pulse rate in Phase 1 and Phase 2.  
A  decrease  of  at  least  20  mmHg  in  SBP  or  a  decrease  of  at  least  10  mmHg  in  DBP  when  a  patient 
moves  from  sitting  position  to  a  standing  position  (orthostatic  BP  changes)  in  Phase  1  occurred  with 
similar  frequency  among  the  3  aliskiren  dose  groups.  In  Phase  2,  orthostatic  BP  changes  were  more 
frequent in the aliskiren mid dose group (Table 12-27). 
A review of study reported AEs did not reveal any ECG related AEs. 
Scores of tests on neurocognitive assessments did not indicate substantial changes after treatment. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Summary of Efficacy 
The  results  of  the  study  Phase  1  demonstrated  a  significant  dose-dependent  BP  lowering  effect  with 
aliskiren  over  a  4  week  treatment  period  with  consistent  findings  for  msSBP  (primary  endpoint)  and 
secondary objectives  (msDBP, MAP, % of responder, and ABPM in a subset of 152 patients). 
The  results  of  the  study  Phase  2  –  that  is  the  changes  from  end  of  Phase1  to  end  Phase  2  –  were 
inconsistent because of a contrast between data for mean changes in msSBP (primary objective) and 
secondary objectives. For patients that switched to placebo in Phase 2, the mean of the msSBP change 
from Phase 1 end was an increase only in the placebo high dose group and was not significant (+1.11 
mmHg, P=0.354).  The mean of the msSBP change was a further decrease in the placebo low group (-
0.64  mmHg)  and  in  the  placebo  mid  dose  group  (-2.90  mmHg).    Briefly,  Phase  2  results  for  the 
primary  objective  do  not  exclude  the  possibility  that  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  blood  pressure 
reduction  during  Phase  1  was  accounted  for  by  factors  other  than  the  treatment  with  aliskiren  given 
that the substitution of aliskiren with placebo was followed by a further decrease in the mean of msSBP 
for the majority of patients. It is noteworthy that the mean of the msSBP decrease in the placebo mid 
dose group was borderline significant (P=0.064) and numerically greater compared to the aliskiren mid 
dose  group.      Findings  for  secondary  objectives  were  in  contrast  with  findings  for  msSBP  (%  of

responders  and  ABPM).    The  response  rate  at  the  end  of  Phase  2  increased  further  in  patients  who 
continued  to  receive  aliskiren  (64%,  70%  and  82%  in  the  aliskiren  low,  mid  and  high  dose  groups 
respectively)  compared  to  patients  who  were  switched  to  placebo.  The  pooled  mid/high  doses  of 
aliskiren had a significantly higher proportion of patients with BP response compared to placebo pooled 
from  corresponding  arms  (77.5%  vs  61.6%,  p=0.038).  ABPM  at  end  of  Phase  2  showed  significantly 
greater  reductions  from  baseline  in  MASBP  (-2.86  mmHg,  p=0.0022)  and  MADBP  (-2.78  mmHg, 
p<0.0001) for the pooled mid/high doses of aliskiren compared to placebo pooled from corresponding 
arms. 
The change in msSBP and msDBP in both Phase 1 and Phase2 were generally consistent irrespective of 
age group, gender, race, ethnicity, weight group, and hypertension etiology. 
There was a positive correlation between aliskiren trough concentration and dose. 
Summary of safety 
Aliskiren was generally well tolerated in this patient population. There were no deaths reported in the 
study. Only 3 SAE were reported in the aliskiren high dose group (head injury in Phase 1 and suicide 
attempt  and  syncope  in  Phase  2).  None  of  these  3  SAE  was  suspected  to  be  related  to  study 
medication. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  among  the  different  treatment  groups  with  majority  of  AEs  of  mild 
severity. 
The discontinuation rate due to any reason was low overall with very few patients discontinuing due to 
an AE. 
The most frequently reported AEs (headache and upper respiratory tract infection) are common in this 
patient population. 
Changes  in  laboratory  parameters  were  generally  minor  with  no  meaningful  differences  among  the 
different treatment groups. 
Discussion: Rapporteur’s conclusions 
This  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  in  the  paediatric  population 
aged  6-17  years.  Three  dose  levels  of  aliskiren  were  evaluated  for  a  total  period  of  8  weeks:  low 
(0.13-0.31 mg/Kg), mid (0.75-1.88 mg/Kg) and high (3.0-7.5 mg/Kg) with a wide dose ratio between 
the low, mid and high dose groups (1:6:24).  The study included two phases: Phase 1 for evaluation of 
dose-response curve, and Phase 2 for evaluation of placebo effects (placebo-controlled withdrawal). 
The primary objective and the secondary objectives of the study Phase 1 were met. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was not met whereas the secondary objectives of the study 
Phase  2  were  partially  met.  The  Applicant  concludes  that  this  inconsistency  might  reflect  insufficient 
washout  of  aliskiren  effect  when  patients  were  switched  to  placebo  (long  biological  half-life  of 
aliskiren).    This  interpretation  does  not  appear  adequate  because  it  does  not  explain  all  the 
inconsistencies such as that between mean changes in msSBP and % of responders (office BP vs office 
BP)  as  well  as  the  contrasting  results  for  msSBP  and  MASBP  (office  BP  vs  ABPM).  Moreover,  the 
possibility of antihypertensive effects  lasting for up to 4 weeks after treatment suspension would rise 
serious doubts about the manageability of aliskiren in the paediatric population.

Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient  population  of  hypertensive  patients  aged  6-17 
years  old.    The  rate  of  discontinuation  was  low.    There  were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs 
(1.1%).  Most  of  the  reported  AEs  were  generally  mild  and  transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety 
profile of aliskiren in this short term study was similar to placebo. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 
years  old  because  of  inconclusive  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  of  the  study 
CSPP100A2365. 
Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old. 
Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population. 
The  Applicant  was  required  to  present  a  variation  application  to  amend  the  Product  Information  of 
aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365 (see section below). 
In view of the available data regarding efficacy and safety of aliskiren in patients aged 6-17 years from 
study  CSPP100A2365, the Rapporteur asked  the MAH  to  either submit a variation in accordance  with 
Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so.  
The above variation application should have amended the relevant sections of the SmPC to include the 
above discussed findings, in line with the wording reported below (changes to the currently approved 
text:  deleted  text  is  strikethrough;  added  text  is  in  bold).  The  PL  should  have  been  updated  in  line 
with the SmPC changes. 
3.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  type  IB  variation,  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  of  the  SmPC  are  being  updated 
according to the outcome of the recently completed Article 46 procedure EMA/H/C/780/P46/039 which 
reviewed  the  results  of  the  aliskiren  paediatric  study  CSPP100A2365  in  children  6-17  years  with 
hypertension. 
The proposed amendments to the SmPC were as follows (see Attachment 1) (changes to the currently 
approved  text:  deleted  text  is  strikethrough;  added  text  is  in  bold;  the  differences  between  the 
wording proposed by the Rapporteur and that proposed by the MAH are highlighted in grey):

Assessor’s comment 
The  recently  completed  Article  46  procedure  EMA/H/C/780/P46/039  reviewed  the  results  of  the 
aliskiren paediatric study CSPP100A2365 in children 6-17 years with hypertension. 
Indeed,  this  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  in  the  paediatric 
population  aged  6-17  years.  Three  dose  levels  of  aliskiren  were  evaluated  for  a  total  period  of  8 
weeks:  low  (0.13-0.31  mg/Kg),  mid  (0.75-1.88  mg/Kg)  and  high  (3.0-7.5  mg/Kg)  with  a  wide  dose 
ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups (1:6:24).  The study included two phases: Phase 1 
for  evaluation  of  dose-response  curve,  and  Phase  2  for  evaluation  of  placebo  effects  (placebo-
controlled withdrawal). 
The primary objective and the secondary objectives of the study Phase 1 were met. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was not met whereas the secondary objectives of the study 
Phase  2  were  partially  met.  The  Applicant  concludes  that  this  inconsistency  might  reflect  insufficient 
washout  of  aliskiren  effect  when  patients  were  switched  to  placebo  (long  biological  half-life  of 
aliskiren).    This  interpretation  does  not  appear  adequate  because  it  does  not  explain  all  the 
inconsistencies such as that between mean changes in msSBP and % of responders (office BP vs office 
BP)  as  well  as  the  contrasting  results  for  msSBP  and  MASBP  (office  BP  vs  ABPM).  Moreover,  the 
possibility of antihypertensive effects lasting for up to 4 weeks after treatment suspension would rise 
serious doubts about the manageability of aliskiren in the paediatric population. 
Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient  population  of  hypertensive  patients  aged  6-17 
years  old.    The  rate  of  discontinuation  was  low.    There  were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs 
(1.1%).  Most  of  the  reported  AEs  were  generally  mild  and  transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety 
profile of aliskiren in this short term study was similar to placebo. 
In conclusion, the efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population 
aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study 
CSPP100A2365. 
Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old. 
Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population. 
The Applicant was required to present a variation  application to amend sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of 
the SmPC of aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365.  
Regarding the section 4.2, the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be 
better to move the following sentence  
“Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6  years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).”  
before the sentence  
“The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years 
have not yet been established.  Currently available data are  described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 
5.2.” 
Moreover,  the  Rapporteur  concluded  that  “Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient 
population of hypertensive patients aged 6-17 years old.  The rate of discontinuation was low.  There 
were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs  (1.1%).  Most  of the  reported  AEs were  generally  mild  and

transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  aliskiren  in  this  short  term  study  was  similar  to 
placebo. …  Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.”  
But, there are no data on long-term safety in this age category, hence it is proposed to add “long-term 
safety”  in  the following sentence  ““The safety and efficacy  of Rasilez in  children aged  6 to 17 years 
with  hypertension  below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are 
described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.” 
Therefore, the wording should be as follows: 
“Paediatric population 
Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6  years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). 
Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 6 to less than 18 years are described in sections 4.8 
and 5.2. No recommendation on a posology can be made for children aged 6 to less than 18 years. 
The  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  aliskiren  in  children  aged  6  to  17  years  with  hypertension 
below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 
4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.” 
Regarding the section 4.4, the MAH made the changes proposed by the Rapporteur as follow: 
“Paediatric population 
Aliskiren  is  a  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  substrate,  and  there  is  a  potential  for  aliskiren  overexposure  in 
children with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter  system is 
mature  cannot  be  determined  (see  sections  5.2  and  5.3).  Therefore,  Rasilez  is  contraindicated  in 
children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years. 
Limited  safety  data  are  available  from  a  pharmacokinetic  study  of  aliskiren  treatment  in  39 
hypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).” 
Regarding the section 4.8, the MAH only made minor editorial changes (highlighted in grey) that do 
not modify the meaning of the wording proposed by the Rapporteur (see below) and these changes are 
endorsed by the Rapporteur:

37.5/75/150 mg [0.75-1.88 mg/kg]; and high dose 150/300/600 mg [3.0-7.5 mg/kg], with 
a  wide  dose  ratio  between  the  low,  mid  and  high  dose  groups  [1:6:24])  in  267  paediatric 
hypertensive  patients  aged  6  to  17  years,  aliskiren  lowered  office  and  ambulatory  blood 
pressure  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  during  the  initial  4  week  dose-finding  phase  of  the 
study  (Phase  1).  However,  in  the  subsequent  4  week  randomised  withdrawal  phase  of  the 
study  (Phase  2),  the  effect  of  aliskiren  overlapped  with  the  effects  observed  in  patients 
switched  to  placebo  in  all  dose  groups  (low,  p=0.8894;  mild,  p=0.9511;  high,  p=0.0563). 
The  average  differences  between  aliskiren  and  placebo  for  the  low  and  mid  dose  groups 
were  <  0.2  mmHg  and  not  significant  as  well.  The  treatment  with  aliskiren  was  well 
tolerated in this study. (Apply also to Rasilez HCT and Rasilamlo SmPCs under 'Aliskiren' subsection) 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with 
Rasilez  in  one  or  more  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  hypertension  (see  section  4.2  for 
information on paediatric use).” 
WORDING PROPOSED BY THE MAH 
“Paediatric population 
In  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  8-week  study  with  aliskiren  monotherapy  (3 
dose  groups  according  to  weight: 
low  6.25/12.5/25  mg  [0.13-0.31  mg/kg];  mid 
37.5/75/150 mg [0.75-1.88 mg/kg]; and high dose 150/300/600 mg [3.0-7.5 mg/kg], with 
a  wide  dose  ratio  between  the  low,  mid  and  high  dose  groups  [1:6:24])  in  267  paediatric 
hypertensive  patients  aged  6  to  17  years,  aliskiren  lowered  office  and  ambulatory  blood 
pressure  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  during  the  initial  4  week  dosefinding  phase  of  the 
study  (Phase  1).  However,  in  the  subsequent  4  week  randomised  withdrawal  phase  of  the 
study  (Phase  2),  the  effect  of  aliskiren  overlapped  with  the  effects  observed  in  patients 
switched  to  placebo  in  all  dose  groups  (low,  p=0.8894;  mid,  p=0.9511;  high,  p=0.0563). 
The  average  differences  between  aliskiren  and  placebo  for  the  low  and  mid  dose  groups 
were <0.2 mmHg. The treatment with aliskiren was well tolerated in this study. 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with 
Rasilez  in  one  or  more  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  hypertension  (see  section  4.2  for 
information on paediatric use).” 
According to the Rapporteur, this editorial change is acceptable and hence the wording of the section 5.1 
with the editorial change proposed by the MAH is endorsed.

4.  Request for supplementary information 
Supplementary information (other concern) is requested to the MAH (see below). 
4.1.  Other concerns which should be addressed by the applicant 
Regarding the section 4.2, the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be 
better to move the following sentence  
“Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6  years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).”  
before the sentence  
“The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years 
have not yet been established.  Currently available data are  described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 
5.2.” 
Moreover,  the  Rapporteur  concluded  that  “Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient 
population of hypertensive patients aged 6-17 years old.  The rate of discontinuation was low.  There 
were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs  (1.1%).  Most  of the  reported  AEs were  generally  mild  and 
transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  aliskiren  in  this  short  term  study  was  similar  to 
placebo. …  Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.”  
But, there are no data on long-term safety in this age category, hence it is proposed to add “long-term 
safety”  in the following sentence  ““The safety and efficacy  of Rasilez in  children aged  6 to 17 years 
with  hypertension  below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are 
described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.” 
Therefore, the wording should be as follows: 
“Paediatric population 
Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6  years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). 
Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 6 to less than 18 years are described in sections 4.8 
and 5.2. No recommendation on a posology can be made for children aged 6 to less than 18 years. 
The  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  aliskiren  in  children  aged  6  to  17  years  with  hypertension 
below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 
4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.” 
5.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
Question 
Regarding the section 4.2, the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be

Summary of the WSA’s response 
The MAH submitted the updated SmPC as follows:   
“Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used 
in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren 
overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6 years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

4.8  and  5.2.  No  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made  for  children  aged  6  to  less  than  18 
years.” 
The  SmPC  update  is  considered  in  line  with  PRAC/CHMP  request.  But,  as  the  efficacy  of  aliskiren 
cannot  be  considered  as  fully  proved  in  the  paediatric  population  aged  6  to  17  years  old  because  of 
inconclusive  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  of  the  study  CSPP100A2365,  in  order  to  avoid 
confusion in the prescriber, it would be better to write in SmPC section 4.2 as follows:  
“The  efficacy  and  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged  6  to  17 years  with 
hypertension  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in  sections 4.8,

instead of  
“The  long-term  safety and efficacy of Rasilez  in children aged 6  to 17 years with hypertension have 
not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2”. 
Conclusion 
The efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 
years  old  because  of  inconclusive  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  of  the  study 
CSPP100A2365. 
Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old. 
Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population. 
The  Applicant  was  required  to  present  a  variation  application  to  amend  the  Product  Information  of 
aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365 (see section below). 
In view of the available data regarding efficacy and safety of aliskiren in patients aged 6-17 years from 
study  CSPP100A2365, the Rapporteur asked  the MAH  to  either submit a variation in accordance  with 
Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so.  
The above variation application should have amended the relevant sections of the SmPC to include the 
above discussed findings, in line with the wording reported below (changes to the currently approved 
text:  deleted  text  is  strikethrough;  added  text  is  in  bold).  The  PL  should  have  been  updated  in  line 
with the SmPC changes.  
The MAH submitted the updated SmPC as follows:   
“Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used 
in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren 
overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). 
The  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged  6  to  17 years  with  hypertension 
below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in 
sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. 
Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children 
aged  2  to  less  than  6 years  because  of  safety  concerns  due  to  potential  aliskiren  overexposure  (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children  aged 16 to less than 18 years are  described in serious 
4.8  and  5.2.  No  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made  for  children  aged  6  to  less  than  18 
years.” 
The  SmPC  update  is  considered  in  line  with  PRAC/CHMP  request.  But,  as  the  efficacy  of  aliskiren 
cannot  be  considered  as  fully  proved  in  the  paediatric  population  aged  6  to  17  years  old  because  of 
inconclusive  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  of  the  study  CSPP100A2365,  in  order  to  avoid 
confusion in the prescriber, it would be better to write in SmPC section 4.2 as follows:  
“The  efficacy  and  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged  6  to  17 years  with 
hypertension  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in  sections 4.8, 
5.1, and 5.2.”

“The  long-term  safety and efficacy of Rasilez  in children aged 6  to 17 years with hypertension have 
not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2”. 
The MAH agreed to update the SmPC section 4.2 with the above proposed changes. 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

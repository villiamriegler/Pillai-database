1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant FGK Representative Service GmbH submitted on 11 March 2019 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Pretomanid FGK, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 
September 2018. 
Pretomanid FGK, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/07/513 on 29/11/2007 in the 
following condition: Treatment of tuberculosis. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Pretomanid is indicated as part of a combination 
regimen with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the treatment of pulmonary extensively drug 
resistant (XDR), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents 
The claimed indication concerns the specific regimen used in the pivotal study (Nix-TB), namely, 
pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Pretomanid FGK as an orphan medicinal 
product in the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pretomanid-fgk.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is  
composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based on 
applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) 
or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0058/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0058/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 6/121 
 
  
 
 
 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The applicant requested a Full Marketing Authorisation. During the procedure, the CHMP proposed a 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14a of the above-mentioned Regulation 
in case of an approval. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance pretomanid contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Protocol assistance 
The applicant did seek Protocol assistance from the CHMP. 
Several CHMP advices were sought for the preclinical part of the program and on quality aspects.  The 
advice on quality aspects concerned designation of starting materials, control of impurities and the 
stability programs. 
A CHMP advice on clinical issues were sought in 2014; however, this advice addressed specifically a 
phase 3 study (NC-006), addressing another Pa-containing regimen and a different indication, and 
does not apply to the present application. 
The clinical program presented so far is considered compliant with the CHMP guidance. Studies 
undertaken in patients with DS-TB include the proper control regimen (HRZE). The pivotal study, Nix-
TB, does not include a control regimen, which is acceptable since no valid standard control regimen 
exists. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Pretomanid FGK as an orphan medicinal 
product in the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pretomanid-fgk

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tuberculosis in humans is an infectious disease caused by M. tuberculosis, which typically affects the 
lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis) but can affect other sites as well (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis).  
While incidence rates and mortality for tuberculosis have been falling, the disease remains one of the 
world’s major causes of illness and death – prompting the WHO in 1993 to declare tuberculosis to be a 
global health emergency.  While tuberculosis is found in every country in the world, it 
disproportionately affects people in resource-poor settings, particularly those in Asia and Africa.  
Nevertheless, tuberculosis outbreaks still occur in industrialized nations.  The WHO estimates that 
1.7 billion people—approximately one quarter of the world’s population—are infected with M. 
tuberculosis (WHO 2018).  Worldwide, in 2017, there were an estimated 10 million incident cases of 
tuberculosis (9% co-infected with HIV), and 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis.  Worldwide, 
tuberculosis is 1 of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent.  
Globally in 2017, there were an estimated 330,000 MDR-TB or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis cases 
among notified tuberculosis patients.  In a survey of 113 countries and 5 territories, the average 
proportion of MDR-TB cases with XDR-TB was 8.5% (95% CI:  6.2%, 11%), an increase from the 
6.2% reported in 2016 (WHO 2017).   
2.1.2.  Management 
MDR-TB refers to disease caused by bacteria resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid. XDR-TB is resistant 
to at least 4 of the major drugs or drug classes used in tuberculosis therapy, that is, rifampicin, 
isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, and at least 1 of the injectable aminoglycosides. Consequently, the 
treatment of XDR-TB is very challenging. Before the very recent introduction in the XDR-TB therapeutic 
armamentarium of new (bedaquiline) or repurposed (linezolid) drugs for which there is little or no pre-
existing resistance, the treatment success rate in XDR-TB patients was extremely poor.  Rates of 
treatment success across the South African studies averaged 14%, with a range of 2% to 22%; 
outside of South Africa, rates of treatment success were more varied, ranging from 15% to 60%, with 
only 2 studies reporting rates above 50%.  
The success rate for treating XDR-TB has very recently improved due to 1) the use of bedaquiline, 
which is approved by the EMA and FDA as part of combination regimens to treat adults with MDR-TB, 
and 2) the increasingly frequent off-label use of linezolid for the treatment of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis (both drugs used as “add-ons” to pre-existing or modified background regimens).  Cure 
rates of 70-80% with such drug combinations have been reported (Lee 2015, Olayanju 2018). 
However, in these studies, treatment was very long (around 2 years) and background regimens were 
complex, including > 10 drugs, oral and injectables. Hence, new shorter and standardized regimens 
are highly warranted.  
About the product 
Pretomanid is a new chemical entity and a member of the nitroimidazooxazine class (whereas 
delamanid is a member of the nitroimidazooxazole class). The mechanism of action is complex and has 
not been fully elucidated. Under aerobic conditions, pretomanid appears to inhibit MTB cell wall 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 9/121 
 
  
 
 
biosynthesis by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid, while under anaerobic conditions, it generates 
reactive nitrogen species. Pretomanid is active both to actively replicating MTB and to dormant bacilli 
(both bactericidal and sterilizing activity). 
The claimed indication is for the treatment of adults with pulmonary XDR-TB, or MDR-TB patients non-
responsive/intolerant to the MDR-TB regimen (such as an injectable). The claimed indication concerns 
the specific regimen used in the pivotal study (Nix-TB), namely, pretomanid in combination with 
bedaquiline and linezolid.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested a Full Marketing Authorisation. The CHMP Rapporteurs, and the CHMP 
following discussions during the procedure, support a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (refer to the 
benefit/risk section). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as an immediate release tablet containing 200 mg of pretomanid as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, 
magnesium stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium lauryl sulfate and povidone. 
The product is available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene closure and 
PVC/PVdC-Aluminium foil blisters packs 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of pretomanid is (6S)-2-Nitro-6-{[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]methoxy}-6,7-
dihydro-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]oxazine. It corresponds to the molecular formula C14H12F3N3O5, its 
relative molecular mass is 359.26 and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of pretomanid. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of by infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy, fluorine (19F), proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and single crystal x-ray structure determination. 
In addition, characteristics of the active substance were also determined with thermal analysis, 
elemental analysis, and UV spectrometry. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 10/121 
 
  
 
 
 
Pretomanid is a white to off-white to yellow colour non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is practically 
insoluble in water and its solubility in buffers (pH 1.0-9.0) is in the range of 0.01-0.02 mg/mL and in 
the range of 0.01-0.09 mg/mL even in simulated physiological media pH 1.5, 5.0 and 6.5 at 37°C. Its 
partition coefficient (LogP) is 2.42. 
The molecule contains one chiral center (6S). The S-enantiomer is the desired isomer. The chiral 
centre of pretomanid originates from a starting material. The undesired isomer (R-enantiomer) is 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
Different solid-state forms of pretomanid have been identified and characterised. Form I is the most 
thermodynamically stable polymorphic form at ambient temperature and pressure and is the one 
synthesised and used for the finished product. 
Changes in polymorphic form during processing and on storage are extremely unlikely to occur. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis of pretomanid consists of three chemical transformations and a recrystallisation process. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail from the starting materials. The 
choice of these substances as starting materials has been justified and is in accordance with CHMP 
scientific advice. Intermediates are isolated and controlled as part of the acceptable control strategy. 
The formation and removal of impurities in all steps are discussed and controlled.  
The manufacturing process development work has been described in sufficient detail and has resulted 
in a manufacturing process giving reproducible active substance with high purity. An enhanced 
approach to process development was taken in line with ICH Q11. While Design of Experiments (DoE) 
studies of process parameters and risk assessments were performed on each step to review and 
identify the possibilities of critical process parameters for that step, no design space is claimed. The 
critical process parameters and their control for the manufacture of pretomanid have been identified, 
presented and are considered acceptable. 
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry 
of new active substances. Several impurities are associated with the manufacturing process, some of 
which are present in substantial amounts and some are potentially mutagenic. The control of the 
impurities was not fully satisfactory in the initial submission and the issue was identified by the CHMP 
as a Major Objection. Updated information was provided and included an adequate discussion on the 
characterisation of potential impurities including genotoxic impurities, their origin, control and carry-
over. The control of impurities, including potentially mutagenic impurities is considered acceptable and 
in line with the CHMP scientific advice. Results from spiking studies have been presented to support 
the controls proposed for impurities in starting materials, intermediates and pretomanid.  
Residual solvents used in the different steps during the synthesis were discussed. No class 1 solvents 
or metal catalysts are used in the manufacture of the starting materials or the active substance. The 
control strategy to control all class 2 and class 3 solvents in the release specification is endorsed. Also, 
benzene, as a potential contaminant in some of the solvents, is controlled in the solvents’ 
specifications, this approach is acceptable. 
The active substance is packaged in white antistatic low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag that is twist 
tied. The LDPE inner bag is placed in an outer high molecular low-density polyethylene (HM LDPE) bag 
that is heat sealed. To further protect the active substance, the HM LDPE bag is placed in a triple 
laminated aluminium bag that is heat sealed. This bag is placed in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
container that is closed with plastic lid having rubber gasket followed by locking ring and metal seal 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 11/121 
 
  
 
 
and labelled. The LDPE bags are certified to comply with regulations for food contact. Specifications 
and certificates are provided for the container closure systems. 
Specification 
Pretomanid active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), 
identification (IR, HPLC), crystal form (XRPD), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), content of enantiomer (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and 
particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The proposed specifications and limits are acceptable. Limits for impurities and solvents have been set 
in accordance with ICH Q3A and Q3C. The absence of tests for elemental impurities and microbial 
testing has been acceptably justified by the applicant.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data were presented for three validation/stability batches manufactured by the 
proposed commercial manufacturing sites. Results were also presented for 21 batches used in non-
clinical studies, clinical studies, validation and stability studies and manufactured by previous 
manufacturing processes and manufacturers. The results comply with specification in place at the time 
of analysis; consistency of active substance has been demonstrated. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 °C/ 60% RH) and intermediate 
conditions (30 °C/ 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated stability conditions (40 °C/ 75% 
RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
Parameters investigated: description, assay, related substances, content of enantiomer, water content 
and crystal form. The analytical methods used correspond to the release methods and are stability 
indicating. There were no significant changes in any of the studied attributes nor clear trends. 
In addition, long-term (25 °C/ 60% RH) and accelerated (40 °C/ 75% RH) stability data have been 
presented for 12 batches manufactured by previous active substance manufacturer and used for 
manufacturing finished product clinical batches. Up to 48 months long-term data is available for these 
batches; results also comply with the specification at the time of analysis. 
Photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B, Option 2 on one commercial scale 
batch of pretomanid. No significant degradation of was observed.  
Forced degradation studies under different conditions have also been performed as part of the related 
substances HPLC method validation. The results showed that pretomanid rapidly degrades when 
treated with base, while no significant degradation of pretomanid was observed by other standard 
treatments: high humidity, heat, solution state degradation study by acid and by peroxide.  
Based on the presented data the proposed retest period of 24 months for the active substance with no 
special storage conditions can be accepted.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white to off-white, oval shaped, uncoated immediate release tablets for oral 
use packed in blister or plastic bottles containing 200 mg pretomanid. The tablet is debossed with M on 
one side and P200 on the other side of tablet; its dimensions are 18 × 9 mm. 
The  qualitative  composition  of  Pretomanid  FGK 
include  pretomanid, 
lactose  monohydrate, 
microcrystalline  cellulose,  sodium  starch  glycolate,  magnesium  stearate,  colloidal  anhydrous  silica, 
sodium lauryl sulfate and povidone.  
The excipients used are commonly known and have well-established use in solid oral dosage forms. 
Their choice has been justified considering the very low solubility of pretomanid. As pretomanid is a 
neutral molecule, with a high resistance to degradation under normal conditions, a formal compatibility 
study with excipients was not considered necessary. Subsequent stability testing under both long term 
and accelerated test conditions has shown the product to be, chemically stable, with no evidence of 
degradation (please refer to “Stability of the product”). These data confirm the compatibility of 
pretomanid with the various excipients in the tablet formulation. 
Pretomanid is considered BCS class II, having low aqueous solubility and high permeability. It has a 
long needle-like crystal shape, which results in poor flow and agglomeration during handling. 
Micronised material was introduced very early in the development process to achieve acceptable blend 
uniformity. Dissolution was also facilitated by the micronised active substance.   
The development of the dissolution method was described in detail. The optimal amount of surfactant 
and the optimal paddle speed were investigated by the applicant.  
The discriminating power of the dissolution method was also investigated. It has been shown that the 
dissolution method is sufficiently discriminatory. The dissolution properties of tablets manufactured by 
different manufacturers involved in the development phase were provided. All results complied with 
the proposed specification limit for dissolution.  
An acceptable tablet manufactured by a wet granulation process was finally developed taking into 
account the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the active substance. 
Possible relationships between excipient particle size and granular flow have been investigated during 
pharmaceutical development. The manufacturing process was developed at different sites before the 
process was transferred and optimised at the commercial manufacturing site. For optimisation of the 
manufacturing process, a risk assessment was carried out on manufacturing parameters that might 
have an impact on the CQAs. The applicant has applied quality by Design (QbD) principles in the 
development of the finished product and their manufacturing process. DoE was used to investigate the 
wet granulation process, the lubrication step and tablet compression. However, no design spaces were 
claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
The proposed formulation and manufacturing processes for commercial product is the same as used in 
Phase 3 clinical studies as well as the primary stability batches. 
The tablets are packaged in PVC/PVdC/aluminium blisters and HDPE bottles, which is standard type of 
packaging for this formulation type and was demonstrated through stability studies to provide 
adequate protection of the product during storage. HDPE bottles are capped with polypropylene screw 
cap with a pulp liner and absorbent cotton is placed inside the bottles.  Acceptable specifications were 
provided for the packaging materials. The packaging materials in contact with the tablet comply with 
the Ph. Eur. and relevant EU regulations and directives.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by wet granulation process. The manufacturing process is 
standard and consists of dry sifting, dry blending, high shear granulation, wet milling, fluid bed drying, 
dry milling, sifting of extragranular material, blending, lubrication and tablet compression. The tablet 
bulk is packed in double LDPE bags with silica gel bags between the two PE bags, which are kept in 
triple laminated aluminium bags. Holding times have been stated. 
In order to achieve the required batch size, and in line with the equipment available, the granulation 
step is carried out as equal sub-lots. Once dried and screened, the lots of granules are combined for 
blending of the extragranular materials to prepare a single batch for compression. 
Extensive process investigations were conducted and have resulted in appropriate controls and limits 
for the granulation, blending, and compression steps, assigned accordingly.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated on three production scale batches. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.- UV) and microbial quality. 
The omission of test for elemental impurities is justified and a satisfactory risk assessment in line with 
ICHQ3D has been provided.  
The applicant has thoroughly investigated and discussed the formation and origin of nitrosamine 
related impurities. The possible formation of the nitrosamine carcinogenic impurities in products was 
also discussed including all currently identified root causes for presence of nitrosamine impurities listed 
in section 12 “What are the currently identified root causes for presence of nitrosamines?” (UPDATED) 
of “Questions and answers on “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders”. 20 
December 2019 EMA/CHMP/428592/2019 Rev. 2. No risks of formation of nitrosamines during the 
manufacturing and packaging of the products were identified by the applicant. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Acceptable batch data for three production scale batches were provided. Batch analyses have been 
presented for a total of three validation/stability batches, five phase 3 clinical batches and for further 6 
small clinical batches. Additional information on batches with 50 and 100 mg tablet strengths which 
were used in phase 1, 2a and 3 clinical studies has been presented in the dossier. All the commercial 
formulation batches comply with the specification that applied at the time. The results indicate 
consistency and uniformity of the product, and that the process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Formal stability data has been provided on three production scale batches (validation batches 
manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site and were packed in both commercial packaging 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 14/121 
 
  
 
 
configuration and stored under long term 30±2°C/ 75±5% RH for up to 12 months and under 
accelerated conditions at 40±2°C/ 75±5% RH for 6 months in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
The following parameters have been investigated: description, HPLC-assay, related substances, 
dissolution, microbiological attributes. The stability results showed no clear trends or significant 
changes in any of the tested parameters at both storage conditions.  
In addition, stability data from five batches manufactured at the two development sites were presented 
as supportive data. These batches were stored at the same storage conditions as described above for 
up to 36 months under long term and six months under accelerated conditions and presented.  
Dedicated in-use stability studies for this solid oral dosage form in multi-dose container (bottle) were 
not considered necessary because according to ICH Q1A (R2) and EMA question and answer “Claims 
for in-use shelf-life for solid oral dosage forms in multi-dose containers”, there is no indication from the 
presented stability and/or stress studies that the product is susceptible to deterioration.  
Results of a formal photostability study as per ICH 1QB on one commercial scale batch showed results 
confirming that the finished product not photosensitive and precautionary measures to protect finished 
product from light are not needed. 
A forced degradation study was performed on Pretomanid FGK tablet as a part of the related 
substances HPLC method validation. The results showed that pretomanid was rapidly degraded by base 
treatment at elevated temperature and no significant degradation was observed by any other standard 
treatments.  
Based on the presented stability data the claimed shelf-life of 2 years without any special temperature 
storage conditions is acceptable (SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4). 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pretomanid (PA-824, Pa) is a new chemical entity and a member of the antimycobacterial 
nitroimidazooxazines drug class. The mechanism of action is complex and has not been fully 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 15/121 
 
  
 
 
established. Under aerobic conditions, pretomanid appears to inhibit MTB cell wall biosynthesis by 
inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid, while under anaerobic conditions it generates reactive nitrogen 
species and a concomitant drop in intracellular ATP levels. The activities of pretomanid require nitro-
reduction within the mycobacterial cell by the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase, Ddn. Pretomanid 
displays activity against drug-susceptible as well as drug-resistant (including multi-drug resistant and 
extensively drug resistant) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) generally in the range of ≤ 0.015 to 2 µg/mL. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant has conducted several in vitro and in vivo studies to address the primary 
pharmacodynamics of pretomanid. The primary pharmacodynamics studies are only briefly 
summarised in the NC section. Please see the Clinical section for further details.  
In vitro  
Pretomanid’s anti-bacterial activity is considered narrow in spectrum. Published effect studies in vitro 
using different assays, indicate that the MIC-range was fully comparable in these studies, ranging from 
0.005 to 0.48 µg/ml regardless of resistance classification (i.e. DS-, MDR- and XDR-TB isolates). Of 
note, isolates with mutations known to yield resistance to pretomanid have MIC values of ≥16 µg/ml. 
Among tested mycobacterial species besides MTB, the MTBC subspecies M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. 
pinnipedi were susceptible, with MICs from ≤ 0.0312 to 0.125 µg/mL. MICs were not measurable 
against M. avium, M. phlei, M. smegmatis, M. fortuitum or M. kansasii. M. leprae is naturally resistant 
as well (it lacks a functional ddn (deazaflavin-dependent Nitroreductase) gene, needed for activation of 
pretomanid). Pretomanid lacks activity against other aerobic bacteria and yeast including E. coli, S. 
aureus, and C. albicans. 
In vivo 
In vivo activity of pretomanid was evaluated in acute, chronic and latent TB murine models as 
monotherapy and in combination with a variety of first- and second-line TB drugs, including the 
compounds in clinical development. In the published studies, efficacy was generally assessed by CFU 
counts in lungs and/or spleens, either at the end of the treatment period (assessment of bactericidal 
activity), or 12 weeks after completion of treatment, to assess relapse (sterilizing capacity). In 
general, pretomanid dosed at 25 mg/kg yielded similar effect in an acute TB model as isoniazid control 
(25 mg/kg). The minimal effective dose (the lowest dose that prevents development of gross lung 
lesions and splenomegaly) and minimal bactericidal dose (the lowest dose that reduces lung CFU 
burdens by 99% compared to pretreatment) was found to be 12.5 and100 mg/kg, respectively, in 
aerosol infected mice. 
Exposure response studies in acute mouse models with various dosing schedules over 24 days, with 
log CFU reduction in lung tissue as the end point, showed that free drug time over MIC had the best 
correlation to effect (R2 = 0.87). 
In summary, the nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that pretomanid was active 
against actively growing drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M.tb. strains. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 16/121 
 
  
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant conducted a radioligand binding assay to evaluate the potential of pretomanid to inhibit 
the binding of a radiolabeled reference ligand to six selected hormone receptors including estrogen, 
glucocorticoids, progesterone, testosterone, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. These results, with 
IC50 values >30 µM (10.8 µg/mL), indicate that pretomanid shows no affinity for binding to these 
receptors at therapeutic concentrations (clinical Cmax = 3.1 µg/mL). The scientific rationale for 
screening against the selected hormone receptors was not presented. A broad off-target screen against 
common drug target classes (e.g. receptors, ion channels, transporters, and enzymes) was not 
provided initially. However, in the response to this issue the applicant performed a receptor off-target 
screen against 86 common pharmacological targets in vitro. Pretomanid (10 µM = 3.6 µg/mL; Clinical 
Cmax= 3.1 µg/mL at 200 mg dose) showed no significant interaction, defined as inhibition or 
stimulation >50%, for any of the human targets tested.  
Furthermore, based on the observation of pretomanid-associated testicular effects in toxicology 
studies, the applicant studied the effect of pretomanid on cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured rat 
hepatocytes. In this study pretomanid, at 10 and 30 μM, had no apparent effect on cholesterol 
biosynthesis. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of pretomanid was investigated in the core battery of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and central nervous systems studies in general accordance with ICH guidelines S7A and 
S7B. These included in vitro cardiovascular electrophysiology studies performed on cells expressing the 
hERG gene and in vivo evaluation of cardiovascular, central nervous system, and respiratory function 
in rats, dogs and nonhuman primates.  Additional cardiovascular studies were conducted in dogs to 
evaluate the potential for QT prolongation associated with combined administration of bedaquiline, and 
a similar study examined potential QT prolongation in monkeys associated with combined 
administration of pretomanid and moxifloxacin (see Pharmacodynamic drug interactions below).   
Cardiovascular 
The results of three separate in vitro cardiovascular (hERG) studies of pretomanid demonstrated 
inhibition of potassium channel current with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
approximately 17 to 20 µM (6.1 to 7.2 µg/mL), providing an exposure margin of ∼ 2x above clinical 
Cmax (3.1 µg/mL, unbound plasma concentration = 2.5 µg/mL), indicating a potential for pretomanid to 
induce QT prolongation. It is noted that none of the three hERG studies were conducted in accordance 
with GLP regulations. However, the different hERG assays included vehicle controls, sufficient number 
of pretomanid test concentrations and yielded similar IC50 values, and the positive controls performed 
as expected, supporting the validity of the assays. In addition, there was no QT prolongation observed 
with pretomanid in the clinical thorough QT study in man (see below). Thus, the lack of formal GLP 
compliance of the hERG studies is considered acceptable. 
In vivo cardiac safety pharmacology (telemetry) studies in dogs did not demonstrate any signal for QT 
prolongation at the dose tested (100 mg/kg, SC). However, in this study the dog plasma concentration 
of pretomanid was below the clinical Cmax, which in turn may preclude the interpretation of study 
data. In subsequent in vivo studies, a significant QT prolongation was observed in all dose groups in 
monkeys given single oral doses of pretomanid (50, 150, 450 mg/kg, PO). Compared to vehicle, mean 
heart rate corrected QTc interval (Fridericia’s Formula) increased by 5 to 8%, 6 to 10%, 7 to 11%, 
(+15 to 23, + 19 to 30, +20 to 35 msec) at 50, 150, 450 mg/kg, respectively. In contrast, no 
increased QT prolongation or any other ECG changes were observed in monkeys administered repeated 
daily oral doses of pretomanid (50, 150 or 450/300 mg/kg/day; 450 mg/kg dose decreased to 300 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 17/121 
 
  
 
 
mg/kg on Day 37) for 3 months or at 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day for 9 months (see also toxicology 
section). In the clinical thorough QT/QTc study performed in healthy subjects (single doses of 400 and 
1000 mg, study DMID-10-0058) revealed no QT prolongation or concerns for the cardiac safety profile 
of pretomanid. In conclusion, pretomanid monotherapy appears to have low risk to cause clinically 
meaningful effects on the rate of ventricular repolarization in patients at the MRHD (200 mg/day). 
Respiratory 
The effects of pretomanid on the respiratory system was investigated in male Sprague Dawley rats 
administered 0, 50, 150, 450 mg/kg. A single oral dose of pretomanid at 450 mg/kg (but not at ≤ 150 
mg/kg) caused significant decreases in respiration rate and minute volume (21% to 25% lower than 
control) that did not resolve within 24 hours of dosing. Although no pharmacokinetic (PK) data were 
generated in this study, an estimated exposure based on single dose PK studies in rat, indicate that 
the exposure margins (Cmax = ∼ 10 µg/mL) in rats at NOEL (150 mg/kg) exceeded clinical Cmax by >3 
fold. 
Central nervous system 
The CNS effects were investigated by means of an Irwin screen in male Sprague Dawley rats 
administered 0, 50, 150, and 450 mg/kg pretomanid. After a single oral dose of pretomanid in the 
Irwin study, depressed neural function (decreased touch response, body tone and grooming) was 
observed at ≥ 150 mg/kg but not at 50 mg/kg. The effects at 450 mg/kg did not resolve within 24 
hours after dosing. The estimated plasma exposure of pretomanid at the NOEL of 50 mg/kg in the rat 
Irwin study, based on single dose rat PK (50 mg/kg, Covance 7504-101), was Cmax = 9.4-11 µg/mL, 
which is approximately 3x the predicted exposure in patients at the maximum recommended human 
dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day (3.1 μg/mL). 
Following repeated daily administration of pretomanid in toxicology studies in mice, rats, and monkeys, 
clinical signs of an effect on nervous system function were observed in all species. In 4-week studies in 
mice, clinical signs recorded as spasm, jump and tumble, and abnormal spontaneous motor activity 
were seen at 500 mg/kg/day (but not at ≤ 150 mg/kg/day), and convulsions were observed at ≥ 250 
mg/kg/day (but not at ≤150 mg/kg/day). In rats, effects on nervous system function included 
hypersensitivity to touch at ≥100 mg/kg/day (but not at ≤30 mg/kg/day) in a three-month study and 
convulsions in male and female rats as observed in several studies ≥ 100 – 300 mg/kg. Exposure 
margins for rats, the most sensitive species for CNS effects (NOEL = 30 mg/kg/day), at the threshold 
for CNS effects compared with human exposure (Cmax = 3.1 µg/mL) at the MRHD was 2-fold. Exposure 
multiple for mice and monkeys at the NOEL for CNS effects were only slightly higher, in the range of 3- 
to 5-fold. 
In summary, the applicant has investigated the safety pharmacology of pretomanid in general 
accordance with the current guidelines. Pretomanid plasma exposures in animals at the NOAELs for 
effects on the function of the nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems were similar to or 
slightly higher (2-3-fold) than the anticipated steady-state exposure at the maximum recommended 
human dose of 200 mg/day. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant has conducted PD interaction studies evaluating cardiovascular effects when pretomanid 
was combined with bedaquiline in dogs or with moxifloxacin in monkeys. There was no apparent 
evidence of an interactive effect on QT prolongation when pretomanid was administered at a single 
dose of 100 mg/kg with bedaquiline (100 mg/kg) to dogs or at a dose of 50 mg/kg with moxifloxacin 
(30 or 100 mg/kg) to monkeys. However, it should be noted that the exposure to pretomanid in dogs 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 18/121 
 
  
 
 
following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg in the combination study with bedaquiline was 
unexpectedly low (Cmax = 2.26 µg/mL) and was below clinical Cmax (3.1 µg/mL), which is an inherent 
methodological limitation of this study, and the dog appears to be an inappropriate species for safety 
studies with pretomanid. In the PD interaction study performed n monkeys, there was a lack of a 
response of 3/4 animals to the 100 mg/kg moxifloxacin dose (“positive control” for assessing QT 
prolongation potential). Therefore, the submitted PD drug interaction studies have several deficiencies 
to allow any conclusions on an interactive effect.  
While it’s of importance to understand potential CV effects for different drug combinations with 
pretomanid, QT prolongation is known to occur with bedaquiline in patients and thus for the B-Pa-L 
(bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid) regimen, therefore data from further combination studies with 
bedaquiline and pretomanid in e.g. monkeys, at clinically relevant pretomanid exposure, are not 
considered necessary. In fact, a moderate QTcF increase of <10 msec was, as expected, reported for 
the B-Pa-L regimen in the clinical Nix-TB study. However, there was a surprisingly high increase in the 
QTcF (about 20 msec) in the clinical studies NC-002 and NC-005 with the Pa-M-Z regimen 
(pretomanid-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide), where no relevant increase is expected by Pa and Z. Since 
moxifloxacin is well recognised to produce a predictable small prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) 
interval (4-7msec), these findings may be a consequence of a yet uncharacterised Pa-Z/M drug 
interaction (see clinical section for details). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) of pretomanid, using the intended clinical route of administration (oral), and the species 
selected for non-clinical safety testing, i.e. rats and monkeys as the main non-clinical species but also 
mice and rabbits. 
Methods of analysis 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) methods used for analyses of pretomanid in plasma in non-clinical GLP 
studies were based on protein precipitation or liquid-liquid extraction followed by liquid 
chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS). Metabolites in plasma, 
urine, faeces, hepatocyte incubations and liver microsomes from mouse, rat, monkey and human 
ADME studies were separated by HPLC, detected by LSC and identified and structurally elucidated by 
LC-MS/MS. The bioanalytical methods are considered adequate.  
Absorption 
In rats the oral 0.4% sodium CMC formulation resulted in higher plasma exposure to pretomanid than 
the HPβCD formulation, probably due to higher uptake, and was therefore used in the rat toxicology 
studies. Even though the plasma exposure was higher following the tablet, capsule, and HPβCD 
formulations, a CMC formulation (0.5% CMC) was used also for the pivotal toxicological studies in 
monkey.  
The rate of absorption of pretomanid to plasma was in general moderate to slow after a single oral dose 
in 0.4 to 0.5% CMC, with mean Tmax values of 1 to 4 h in mice, 5.3 to 8.0 h in rats, 1.3 h in dogs, 3.7 
to 6.7 h in rabbits and 2.3 to 6.0 h in monkeys, which is in line with the mean Tmax of 4 to 5 h in 
humans. Mean oral bioavailability for pretomanid in CMC was low in monkeys (19%) and not determined 
in mice, rats (52% for pretomanid in HPβCD) and dogs. Absolute oral bioavailability was not 
determined in humans. 
Exposure to pretomanid (AUC) following a single oral dose in CMC increased approximately in proportion 
with dose in mice (100 to 600 mg/kg), rabbits (10 to 500 mg/kg) and monkeys (25 to 100 mg/kg) and 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 19/121 
 
  
 
 
less than dose proportional in rats (50 to 500 mg/kg). In rats the exposure to pretomanid was slightly 
higher in females than in males (approximately 2-fold) at the higher dose levels (250 and 500 mg/kg), 
which is reflected in the plasma elimination half-lives.  
Fed conditions did not appear to have any impact on the bioavailability in monkeys. Oral bioavailability 
(AUC) following the tablet formulation was slightly higher (24%) in fasted monkeys as compared with 
monkeys fed with standard diet whereas FDA high fat/calorie breakfast had no consistent effect.  
Elimination of pretomanid from plasma following oral administration in CMC was in general rather rapid 
with mean plasma elimination half-lives ranging from 2 to 10 h in female mice, 5.0 (male) to 24.3 
(female) h rats, 3.0 to 4.9 h in female rabbits and 3.3 to 5.4 h in male monkey. In rat and monkey, 
the terminal elimination half-life in plasma was markedly longer for total 14C-pretomanid-derived 
radioactivity (40 to 71 h in rats and 149 to 156 h in monkeys) than for pretomanid, indicating that 
metabolites with long plasma half-lives and potential for accumulation at repeated dosing are formed 
in both toxicological species.  
Distribution 
Tissue distribution in albino (Spraque Dawley) and pigmented (Long Evans) rats following oral 
administration of cold or [benzyl or imidazooxazine 14C]-labelled pretomanid was evaluated by liquid 
scintillation counting or LC/MS/MS and quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA).  
The results were in general similar between pigmented and non-pigmented rats and showed that 
pretomanid-derived radioactivity was widely and rapidly distributed to all evaluated tissues at the first 
sampling 0.25 h post dose with a maximum of tissue/plasma ratios above 1 at 4 h which decreased to 
below 1 at the last sampling (96 h for pigmented and 48 h for unpigmented rats). Highest 
concentrations of radioactivity, excluding the GI tract, were observed in harderian gland, liver, adrenal 
gland, renal cortex, kidney, renal medulla, pancreas, exorbital lacrimal gland and spinal cord.  
There were slight differences between the radioactivity elimination rates of the two different labels.  
For [imidazooxazine-14C]-pretomanid, clearance of radioactivity from most tissues was complete by 96 
hours postdose.  In contrast, for [benzyl-CH2-14C]-pretomanid, clearance was incomplete from most 
tissues by 96 hours postdose, with a mean of 15.3% of the administered dose remaining in the 
carcasses at 96 hours postdose.  
Tissue/plasma ratios above 1 in the brain at 0.25 to 12 hours post dose indicated passage through the 
blood-brain barrier. There were however no indications of selective or persistent distribution to 
melanin-containing tissues of pigmented male rats. 
Protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human plasma was moderate to high and similar 
between species (average protein binding ranged from 80.1% in rats to 87.1% in dogs; 86.4% in 
humans) and did not change over the concentration range tested (0.5 to 12 µg/mL). Mean 
blood/plasma concentration ratios determined for pretomanid at 2.5-10 µg/ml did not show any 
significant concentration-dependency (up to 0.83 in humans, 0.98 in monkeys, 1.47 in rats and 1.72 in 
mice) and indicated a low potential for partitioning into erythrocytes of humans and monkeys and a 
moderate potential in mice and rats.  
In pregnant rats and rabbits, pretomanid was readily transferred through the placenta with similar or 
higher concentrations observed in rat foetal plasma as compared to maternal plasma (up to 1.8-fold at 
24 h post dose), whereas the foetal plasma concentrations in rabbits were approximately 59% to 110 
% of those observed in maternal plasma at 1 to 24 h post dose.

Metabolism 
The metabolism of pretomanid was investigated in vitro in liver microsomes of mouse, monkey and 
humans, in hepatocytes of mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and human and in vivo in rat, monkey and 
human. 
In vitro 
Pretomanid was moderately to relatively stable in liver microsomes and hepatocytes across species 
with a metabolic turnover from <10% to 51% in humans and from <10% in rats up to 63% in 
monkeys at 0.5 to 50 µM substrate concentration.  
Twelve metabolites variably distributed among all species were detected in hepatocytes (M36, M37, 
M38, M39, M40, M41, M42, M10, M8, M11, M43 and M20; the 7 bolded metabolites represented ≥ 
1% of total radioactivity). In human hepatocytes 11 metabolites were detected (M8, M10, M11, M19, 
M20, M36, M37, M38, M40, M42, and M43; the 6 bolded metabolites represented ≥ 1% of total 
radioactivity), of which all were detected in laboratory animal hepatocytes.  
In addition, metabolite, M50 was detected in liver microsomes of humans, mice and monkeys at 2-4%, 
3-11% and 5%, respectively, of initial pretomanid concentration.  
CYP3A4 seems to be involved in the metabolism of pretomanid in vitro with 80% of parent compound 
remaining after incubation with human rCYP3A4. 
In vivo 
Pretomanid was extensively metabolised. Unchanged drug and 21 pretomanid-derived metabolites 
were characterized in rat plasma, urine, and faeces of rats and monkeys following a single oral dose of 
15 mg/kg [benzyl or imidazooxazine 14C]-pretomanid (M1, M6, M7, M12, M13, M15, M18, M19, M20, 
M21, M23, M10, M11, M24A, M26, M27, M31, M48, M49, M50, M52). Metabolism occurred via oxidation 
at multiple sites, the reduction of the nitro group to an amine, oxidative deamination, and oxidative-
cleavage to form hydroxy imidazole and 4-trifluoromethoxybenzoic acid. Subsequent conjugation of 
some of the primary metabolites with glucuronic acid, glycine (monkeys only), or cysteine was also 
observed. In rat plasma, principal metabolites included trifluoromethoxybenzoic acid (M19), 
trifluoromethoxyphenyl-methoxy-hydroxypyranpretomanid (M31), pyran ring-opened pretomanid-
carboxylic acid (M49), ethyl-trifluoromethoxybenzoic acid (M21) and hydroxy-imidazole (M50). In 
monkey plasma, the principal metabolites included M19, M49, M31 and M50 observed in rat plasma, 
plus four additional metabolites (M24, M27, M48, including one conjugated metabolite (M11)). 
In humans, 14 metabolites (M10, M13, M19, M20, M24, M26, M27, M28, M31, M48, M49, M50, M51 
and M52) were detected in plasma following a a single oral dose [benzyl or imidazooxazine 14C]-
pretomanid (873 to 1100 mg). Highest levels were noted for M19, which represented 35% of the 
exposure to parent [benzyl 14C]-pretomanid] based on AUC0-inf, and M27 (hydroxy-dihydro-pyran ring 
opened-amino), M50 (hydroxy imidazole) and M52 (hydroxyl aminooxazine), which represented less 
than 10% of the exposure to parent [imidazooxazine 14C]-pretomanid] based on AUC0-t. Two of the 
human circulating metabolites, M28 and M51, were not detected in rat or monkey plasma but in rat 
and monkey urine and rat faeces (M28), i.e. all human circulating metabolites detected following a 
single oral dose of pretomanid were formed in the toxicological animal species.  
The terminal elimination half-life in plasma of humans, rats and monkeys was markedly longer for total 
14C-pretomanide-derived radioactivity (approximately 18 days in humans, 40 to 71 h in rats and 149 to 
156 h in monkeys) than for pretomanid (16 h in humans, 5.0 to 9.1 h in rats and 3.9 to 5.4 h in 
monkeys at comparable doses). The long plasma half-lives for total radioactivity were shown to be due 
to unextractable radioactivity and to represent at least 3 metabolites in humans, M44, M45 and M46, 
which were all indicated to be present in plasma of rats and monkeys. Based on the differences in half-
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 21/121 
 
  
 
 
lives between species, accumulation of unextractable bound metabolites at repeated dosing are 
expected to be higher in humans than in rats or monkeys.  
Excretion 
Mass balance data were obtained from rats and monkeys. Overall, the results indicate that elimination 
pathways for pretomanid in rats, monkeys and humans are comparable. Urinary excretion of 
metabolites is the major clearance route for absorbed drug (in humans, rats and monkeys, 
approximately 55-65%, 45-56% and 30-32%, respectively, of the dose are excreted in urine) with 
metabolism and excretion into faeces playing a smaller role in elimination (in humans, rats and 
monkeys, approximately 25-40%, 26% and 26-28%, respectively, of the dose are excreted in faeces).  
In lactating rats pretomanid was excreted in milk with greater (1.4-1.6-fold) concentrations of 
compound observed in milk at 6 hours after the maternal dose as compared to the 4-hour post-dose 
maternal plasma concentration. The plasma exposure in suckling pups was ≤1/20 of maternal plasma, 
but the concentrations detected in the high dose group were still more than 10% of the Cmax in 
patients administered 200 mg pretomanid/day (3.1 µg/ml in study NC-005). This is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies of 14 days, 3 months, and 6 months duration were 
conducted in rats and studies of 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months duration were conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys. In all studies, doses were administered daily by oral or nasogastric gavage 
corresponding to the proposed clinical oral dosing regimen. In the chronic studies, post-treatment 
assessments continued for 3 months to evaluate reversibility, progression, or delayed toxicity.  
Rat 
Oral administration of pretomanid to male and female rats for 14 days caused clinical signs of toxicity 
at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, including ataxia, hyperactivity, and mortality in females at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day, and 
convulsions and mortality in both males and females at 1000 mg/kg/day.  Body weight gains were 
lower in both sexes at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day and weight loss occurred at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day.  Treatment-
related microscopic findings included minimal to moderate degeneration/inflammation of cardiac 
myocytes in the heart (1000 mg/kg/day); lymphoid depletion in spleen, thymus, Peyer’s patches, and 
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (≥ 500 mg/kg/day); bone marrow fatty infiltration (≥ 100 
mg/kg/day) and cell depletion (1000 mg/kg/day); testicular, epididymal, and prostate degeneration 
and cell debris (≥ 500 mg/kg/day males); minimal to slight uterine atrophy (≥ 250 mg/kg/day 
females); and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy in liver (≥ 100 mg/kg/day).  Based on adverse 
clinical observations, reduced body weight gains, and bone marrow microscopic findings, a dose of 50 
mg/kg/day was considered the NOAEL.  
Oral administration of pretomanid to male and female rats for 3 months followed by a 3-month 
recovery period caused marked reversible decreases in food consumption and body weight gain at 100 
≥ mg/kg/day.  Irreversible testicular atrophy was observed at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, hepatocellular 
hypertrophy at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, and reversible splenic and thymic lymphoid depletion at 300 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 22/121 
 
  
 
 
 
mg/kg/day males.  Irreversible cataracts were observed at 300 mg/kg/day. Delayed onset cataracts 
were observed in one high dose recovery male that did not have cataracts at the end of dosing. The 
NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day based on adverse clinical observations, decreased body weight and 
testicular degeneration/atrophy observed at 100 mg/kg/day. 
Oral administration of pretomanid to male and female rats for 26 weeks caused reduction in body 
weight gain and food consumption at 30, 100, or 300/200 mg/kg/day.  Pretomanid caused irreversible, 
late onset, cataracts at 100 mg/kg/day and testicular atrophy/degeneration at doses of 30 mg/kg/day 
and higher.  The observed testicular toxicity was associated with changes in endocrinological and 
semenological clinical biomarkers, however, testosterone levels were not affected.  Renal tubular 
degeneration was observed in 100 and 300/200 mg/kg males and in all treated females.  These 
findings reversed completely in males given 300/200 mg/kg/day and reduced in incidence but not 
severity in females at 300/200 mg/kg/day.  The renal changes were not associated with any functional 
changes as indicated by renal clinical pathology parameters.  Based on the severity and adversity of 
clinical and histologic findings in this study, the NOAEL was determined to be 10 mg/kg/day.   
Cynomolgus monkey 
In the 2-week oral toxicity study in the cynomolgus monkey the main findings were CNS-related 
clinical signs included ataxia and convulsions followed by lateral recumbency and ataxia, or front limb 
tremors at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day and hypoactivity at ≥ 450 mg/kg/day.  Decreased heart rate and 
prolonged QT interval was observed at ≥ 450 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and body weight loss 
were observed at ≥ 450 mg/kg/day and was accompanied by reduced food consumption at ≥ 150 
mg/kg/day. Decreases in thymic weights correlated with minimal to moderate lymphoid depletion in 
the thymus at ≥ 450 mg/kg/day. The no-observable-effect level (NOEL) was 50 mg/kg/day based on 
the reduced food consumption and mild QT interval prolongation observed at 150 mg/kg/day.  Drug-
related changes completely resolved or were very nearly resolved in the 450 mg/kg/day monkeys after 
16 days of recovery. 
In the 3-month oral toxicity study with a 3-month recovery period in the cynomolgus monkey the high 
dose (450 mg/kg/day) was associated with ataxia and convulsions in two animals and marked body 
weight loss in most animals causing a reduction in dose.  These monkeys exhibited inappetence, 
watery faeces, and decreased activity; histologically, they exhibited reversible hepatocellular 
hypertrophy and reversible mild to severe thymic lymphoid depletion.  At the end of the recovery 
period, in the 450/300 mg/kg/day group, one male and one female had bilateral cataracts not 
observed during pre-treatment or during the dosing period.  Recovery was not evaluated in the low- 
and mid-dose groups precluding observations on possible late onset cataracts at these doses.  At 150 
mg/kg/day, females also lost body weight and males had only a slight gain.  Mild to moderate thymic 
lymphoid depletion was observed in males and females of this group.  No significant adverse findings 
were observed for males or females at 50 mg/kg/day; hence, this dose was concluded to be the 
NOAEL. 
Oral administration of pretomanid to cynomolgus monkeys for 9 months at doses of 0, 25, 50, and 100 
mg/kg/day was generally well tolerated.  Loss of appetite and corresponding weight loss was observed 
during the first 3 months of the study, though animals gradually acclimated to the drug and treatment 
procedures with corresponding improvements in food consumption and body weight.  The only gross 
pathologic finding at necropsy related to pretomanid was thickening of the wall of the stomach and/or 
small intestine in most monkeys at all dose levels.  In the small intestine, thickening was segmental.  
There were no histopathologic findings to account for the macroscopic thickening, and no 
histopathologic findings in any tissue that were considered to be related to pretomanid.  Thickening 
showed evidence of resolving during the recovery period, as it was present only in the stomach of one 
high-dose male at the end of the recovery period. In the final report, the Study Director concluded that 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 23/121 
 
  
 
 
“Gastrointestinal lesions were seen at the lowest dose level; therefore, a no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was not determined for this study but is considered to be less than 25 mg/kg/day.”  
The applicant does not consider the thickened appearance of the stomach and/or small intestine to be 
an adverse effect without correlating data.  The macroscopic thickening was not associated with any 
in-life or post-mortem evidence of an effect on gastrointestinal tract function or general health.  The 
applicant does consider the lower weight gain in females at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day to be adverse, and 
therefore would identify 25 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL in females. The applicant also believes that the 
weight loss in 2 males at 100 mg/kg/day, which resulted in a decreased weight gain in that group, is 
adverse; however, it is noted that 3 of the 6 males (50%) in this group had weight gains comparable 
to those in control males.  Therefore, the applicant identified 50 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL in males. 
The applicant’s position is agreed and the NOAEL in this study is considered to be 25 mg/kg/day in 
females and 50 mg/kg/day in males. 
Testicular Toxicity 
Testicular toxicity was observed in male mice and rats in all repeat-dose studies but was not observed 
in male monkeys in any repeat-dose study.  
Testicular toxicity in rodents was dose- and time dependent.  In mice, the NOAELs for testicular effects 
produced exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24) anticipated to be lower than maximum recommended human 
dose (200 mg/day).  In male rats, testicular toxicity showed evidence of being partially reversible with 
shorter duration of administration or at dose levels near the threshold.  At higher dose levels, testicular 
toxicity was irreversible, associated with lack of fertility, and accompanied by reduced serum inhibin-B 
concentration and increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration.  In a 13-week 
study, exposures at the NOAEL were similar to or slightly higher than anticipated human exposures at 
the proposed dose.  In a 26-week study, exposures at the NOAEL were lower than predicted human 
exposures.   
In contrast to rodents, testicular toxicity was not observed in male cynomolgus monkeys, even with 
prolonged administration at plasma exposures that greatly exceeded the threshold for testicular 
toxicity in male rats.  No testicular findings were identified in male monkeys given high daily oral doses 
of pretomanid for 9 months.  Small decreases in sperm count and motility together with an increased 
ratio of abnormal to normal sperm were noted at high doses in a 13-week monkey study and the 
applicant considered this secondary to poor physical condition. However, this is not agreed. It cannot 
be ruled out that the observed effects on sperm motility, sperm count and sperm morphology is a 
direct effect of pretomanid exposure, especially when taking into account the consistent testicular 
toxicity observed in the rat and mice repeat-dose toxicity studies.  At the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg/day the 
Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 87/88 was 5.814 µg/mL and 70.395 µg*h/mL, respectively resulting in 
exposure margins of 1.9 and 1.2, respectively, to the maximum human exposure.  
Cataracts 
In rats, cataracts developed in about 20% of the animals administered a high dose of pretomanid for 
13 weeks or a lower (but still high) dose for 26 weeks.  In monkeys, cataracts developed in 2 of 4 
animals given a high dose of pretomanid for 16 weeks.  In that study, the cataracts were not present 
in 8 monkeys necropsied at the end of dosing but arose during a 13-week recovery period.  
By contrast, in a second 13-week study in which monkeys were given high daily oral doses of 
pretomanid for 13 weeks and then maintained for an additional 20-week recovery period, frequent eye 
exams were conducted, but no cataracts developed.  Cataracts also did not develop in monkeys given 
high daily oral doses of pretomanid for 39 weeks. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 24/121 
 
  
 
 
Because of cataract findings in non-clinical studies the applicant has included slit-lamp examinations 
with careful age-related eye disease study 2 (AREDS2) scoring of lens opacities in clinical studies. 
These studies have shown no association of concern between pretomanid exposure and cataracts in 
humans. The safety of pretomanid with respect to cataract development was also evaluated by 
searching for TEAEs in the SMQ for lens disorders. It was concluded that the extensive evaluation of 
lens opacities in the clinical development program did not raise any concern in humans that 
pretomanid may cause cataracts in the proposed regimen. 
CNS Effects 
Central nervous system (CNS)-related clinical signs, including convulsions, were observed in mice, 
rats, and monkeys following administration of pretomanid at higher dose levels.  These were not 
associated with gross pathologic or histopathologic findings in the brain in any study. 
In mice given daily oral doses of pretomanid for 4 weeks, CNS-related clinical signs (spasm, jump-and-
tumble, and abnormal spontaneous motor activity) were observed at high doses that exceeded the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  In male rats, high single doses of pretomanid caused depressed 
neural function (decreased touch response, body tone and grooming).  In repeat dose studies in rats, 
high doses were associated with clinical signs of hyperactivity, sensitivity, ataxia, and convulsions.  In 
monkeys, CNS-related clinical signs included ataxia and convulsions followed by lateral recumbency 
and ataxia, or front limb tremors at a high dose of pretomanid given for two weeks. In longer repeat 
dose studies in which monkeys were given lower, but still high doses of pretomanid, ataxia and 
convulsions were rare but observed in 2 studies. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) for convulsions was low across the clinical development program, and it was concluded that the 
available clinical data does not raise concern that pretomanid may cause convulsion in the proposed 
regimen. 
Liver Effects 
Hepatocellular hypertrophy was seen in mice, rats, and monkeys given daily oral doses of pretomanid 
at higher dose levels and was considered an adaptive response associated with increased metabolism.  
There were a few instances of minimally increased serum transaminase activity in rats and one 
instance of single-cell hepatocellular necrosis in a mouse; however, these occurred at dose levels that 
exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and were not the major cause of animal morbidity.     
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of pretomanid has been studied with respect to gene mutations in bacteria and 
mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations in vitro using rat S9 mix and in vivo in the mouse with 
negative results. It is concluded that pretomanid itself is not genotoxic.  
However, one metabolite (M50 = hydroxy imidazole) was further studied and was found positive in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay both with and without metabolic activation (rat S9) despite negative 
results when testing pretomanid itself. The Applicant states that these tests were conducted since M50 
was not quantified in the in vitro genotoxicity studies using pretomanid and therefore it was unclear if 
the potential genotoxic hazard posed by the metabolite had been evaluated. The applicant suggests 
that it is likely that M50 is formed by rat S9 based on the in vivo detection at 24% of the AUC. M50 
was formed when mouse liver microsomes and mouse hepatocytes were incubated with pretomanid. It 
is however unclear to what extent M50 (or any other metabolite) is formed by rat microsomes, data is 
lacking, and the use of rat S9 instead of mouse microsomes in the in vitro studies could be questioned. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 25/121 
 
  
 
 
 
However, in humans M50 is considered as a minor metabolite and there is no requirement to study it 
separately unless accumulation in humans is demonstrated.  In any case, the mutagenicity potential of 
M50 has been adequately tested in vitro and in vivo. The M50 metabolite was confirmed to be present 
in plasma of mice exposed to pretomanid (in the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study and in the 
carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice), indicating that also the clastogenic potential of M50 was 
sufficiently studied in vivo in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus studies performed with 
pretomanid. Overall, the M50 metabolite is considered to be mutagenic in vitro and the possible risk 
for carcinogenicity cannot be excluded and need to be predicted from in vivo carcinogenicity studies. 
Carcinogenicity 
A 26-week oral study was conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of pretomanid in Tg.rasH2 
transgenic mice. This study also evaluated the toxicokinetic profile of pretomanid and M50 in wild-type 
Tg.rasH2 litter mates following 2 weeks administration. There were no pretomanid-induced early 
deaths, tumors, non-neoplastic microscopic findings, or gross necropsy findings when male and female 
TG.rasH2 mice were administered pretomanid once daily by oral gavage for 26 weeks at doses of 5, 15 
and 40 mg/kg/day in males and 10, 30 and 80 mg/kg/day in females. Oral administration of 
pretomanid produced plasma exposure to both pretomanid and its metabolite M50 at all doses, with 
exposure to pretomanid more than 10 times the exposure to the M50 metabolite at all doses in both 
sexes. The exposure to pretomanid at the high dose was in the range 2 to 5 times the maximum 
human exposure based on Cmax and AUC0-24.  
Chronic toxicity studies conducted with pretomanid in rats and monkeys have not raised any cause for 
concern about carcinogenic hazard.  There was no increase in the incidence of pre-neoplastic or 
neoplastic findings in rats given daily oral doses of pretomanid for 26 weeks at up to the maximum 
tolerated dose level of 100 mg/kg or monkeys given daily oral doses of pretomanid for 39 weeks at up 
to the maximum tolerated dose level of 100 mg/kg.   
Reproduction Toxicity 
Administration of pretomanid to male rats for 13 weeks reduced fertility at 30 mg/kg/day and 
produced complete infertility at 100 mg/kg/day.  Infertility was associated with testicular atrophy, 
lower sperm counts, reduced sperm motility, lower serum inhibin B concentration, and higher serum 
FSH concentration.  After a 10 week recovery period, effects on fertility at 30 mg/kg/day showed 
partial improvement but effects at 100 mg/kg/day were unchanged. The NOAEL for male fertility is 
considered to be 10 mg/kg/day. Toxicokinetic data were not generated in this study but Cmax and AUC0-
24 values in male rats at 10 mg/kg/day were approximately 2.3 µg/mL and 27.5 μg*h/mL, 
respectively, in the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study (Covance 7504-170), indicating no exposure 
margin to the clinical exposure. Based on these findings together with testicular toxicity findings in 
repeat-dose studies in the rat and the mouse and effects on sperm in a limited number of cynomolgus 
monkeys adverse effects on human male fertility cannot be ruled out.    
Pretomanid did not directly affect reproductive function in female rats given daily oral doses for two 
weeks at up to 100 mg/kg/day.  
In the rat EFD study the maternal NOAEL for pretomanid was 10 mg/kg/day, based on reduced 
maternal body weight and/or body weight gain and feed consumption during the entire dosage period 
at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day.  At 100 mg/kg/day, dams also showed clinical signs of ill health. Pretomanid was 
not teratogenic and did not affect fetal survival, growth, or development at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day.  At 100 
mg/kg/day, postimplantation loss was increased, litters were smaller, the number of live fetuses and 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 26/121 
 
  
 
 
fetal body weight were lower, and skeletal development was slowed (reduction in ossified hindlimb 
phalanges).  The latter was considered secondary to a general reduction in fetal growth rate.   
The NOAEL for effects on fetal development was 30 mg/kg/day, which produced average maternal Cmax 
and AUC0-24h values of 6.28 µg/mL and 104.2 h*µg/mL, respectively, on DG 18 (day 12 of dosing), 
indicating an exposure margin of 2.0 and 1.8, respectively. 
In the rabbit EFD the maternal NOAEL for pretomanid was 10 mg/kg/day, based on reduced maternal 
body weight and/or body weight gain and feed consumption during the entire dosage period at ≥ 30 
mg/kg/day.  At ≥ 60 mg/kg/day, dams also had reduced fecal output.  Pretomanid did not affect fetal 
survival, growth, or development at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day.  In the DRF study fetal body weights 
were reduced at 100 mg/kg/day. Based on these results, pretomanid was not teratogenic and did not 
affect embryofetal development in rabbits.  
The NOAEL for effects on fetal development was 60 mg/kg/day, which produced average maternal Cmax 
and AUC0-24 values of 8.24 µg/mL and 87.8 h*µg/mL, respectively, on gestation day 19, corresponding 
to an exposure margin of 2.7 and 1.5, respectively. Mean fetal plasma concentrations were 
approximately 59% to 110% of those observed in maternal plasma, demonstrating the pretomanid 
crossed the placenta. 
In the PPND study in the rat the NOAEL for toxicity in the F0 dams 20 mg/kg/day, based on reduced 
maternal body weight and/or body weight gain and feed consumption during late gestation and 
lactation at 60 mg/kg/day.  The NOEL for effects on F1 pups also was 20 mg/kg/day, based on lower 
pup weights and a slight delay in the age at which the air-drop righting reflex developed in pups born 
to and nursed by dams given pretomanid at 60 mg/kg/day.  These effects were probably secondary to 
effects on dams, rather than direct effects of pretomanid itself. Pretomanid did not affect pup survival 
or post-weaning growth or otherwise clearly affect pup development at any dose level.  There were no 
effects on the development of the neuromuscular or reproductive systems. Administration of 
pretomanid to nursing dams resulted in the presence of pretomanid in milk at all dose levels.  Although 
pretomanid concentration was higher in milk than plasma at each dose level, it was much lower in 
plasma of pups than plasma of dams at each dose level.  
The findings in the reproductive toxicity studies are adequately concluded in the SPC section 4.6 and 
5.3. 
Other toxicity studies 
No melanin binding was observed in pigmented rats. A positive signal for phototoxicity was observed in 
an in vitro 3T3 NRU-PT assay and a subsequent in vivo assay was performed in pigmented rats. Oral 
administration of pretomanid at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day elicited cutaneous reactions indicative of 
phototoxicity (erythema, grade 1 barely perceptible light redness).  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment concerning pretomanid conducted according to 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 was provided. 
The LogD was measured experimentally at various pH values using the shake flask method. The LogD 
ranged from 2.3 to 2.4 at pH 3.0-11.0. The study was not performed in accordance with GLP, however 
it is considered sufficient for the purpose of determining if further PBTscreening is needed. It is 
concluded that pretomanid is not bioaccumulative.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 27/121 
 
  
 
 
The Applicant provided crude prevalence data in the EU in 2017 as published by the WHO. The crude 
prevalence of TB within Europe was 1.11 per 10.000. The proportion of patients with MDR-TB was 
3.3% giving a prevalence of MDR-TB of 0.037 per 10.000. This corresponds to an Fpen of 0.0000037. 
Based on this the PECsurfacewater for pretomanid was calculated to 0.00018 μg/l, thus a Phase II 
assessment is not required.    
It is noted that the sentence “Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements” is present in the SmPC section 6.6 as required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The non-clinical pharmacology program, which has in general been performed in accordance with 
current guidelines and the data package appears to support the rationale to use pretomanid in the 
intended disease indication. The selection of the rat as the primary rodent species and the monkey as 
the primary non-rodent species in the pivotal toxicity studies is acceptable, considering the low 
systemic exposure of pretomanid in dogs.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The potential off-target effects of pretomanid on common targets, such as different receptors, 
enzymes and ion channels, was not provided initially. In response to this issue the applicant performed 
a receptor off-target screen against common pharmacological targets in vitro. Pretomanid (10 µM = 
3.6 µg/mL; Clinical Cmax= 3.1 µg/mL at 200 mg dose) showed no significant interaction, defined as 
inhibition or stimulation >50%, for any of the 86 human targets tested. 
Safety pharmacology 
Non-clinical safety concerns identified for pretomanid include CNS-related clinical signs, including 
convulsions, as observed in mice, rats, and monkeys following administration of pretomanid after 
EMA/200048/2020

single and repeat oral dosing. The exposure margins for CNS effects in animals were low (∼ 2-3-fold 
above clinical Cmax). Albeit there only has been described a few cases of convulsions in the clinical 
trials, a potential relation to pretomanid could not be excluded. The applicant was initially asked to 
discuss the potential mechanism for pretomanid-induced convulsions in animals, and how this 
mechanism is translated into the clinical setting and if the pretomanid-induced convulsions observed in 
the non-clinical studies is of clinical relevance. In the response, the applicant did not propose any 
mechanism for the convulsions. Since the mechanism is still not determined, it is unclear if the four 
cases of seizures observed in clinical trials are related to pretomanid or not. However, the clinical 
seizure cases all had alternative aetiologies (prior seizure history, CNS tuberculoma, moxifloxacin, 
heavy alcohol use) that may explain the seizure activity. In sum, even though the mechanism for non-
clinical convulsion is still unknown, the clinical relevance of this non-clinical finding seems low. Due to 
the lack of mechanistic knowledge, the findings are described in section 5.3 of the product information.  
A potential for pretomanid to cause QT prolongation is indicated by the in vitro hERG studies, showing 
a hERG signal (ratio of hERG IC50 to clinical free Cmax ratio < 3x), and the evidence of QT prolongation 
as observed at all dose levels in monkeys given single oral doses of pretomanid (50, 150, 450 mg/kg; 
Cmax = 5.8 µg/mL at 50 mg/kg). In order to further investigate the torsadogenic potential of 
pretomanid, the applicant was asked to considered performing further in-vitro electrophysiological 
studies with special emphasis on the effects of pretomanid on other cardiac ion channels. in response 
to this question, the applicant performed novel in vitro electrophysiology studies (patch clamp) to 
characterise the potential interaction of pretomanid with cardiac ion channels including hNav1.5, 
hKCNQ1/mink, and hCav1.2. The provided data indicate that pretomanid is a mixed ion channel 
blocker. Whereas pretomanid did not inhibit hNav1.5 late and hCav1.2 ion channels (IC50-values > 30 
µM), pretomanid showed inhibition of hNav1.5 peak and hKCNQ1/minK ion channels with IC50-values 
of 28.6 µM and 23.24 µM, respectively, which is approximately 19-23 fold higher compared to clinically 
free plasma concentration of pretomanid. The rather unspecific ion channel blocking effect of 
pretomanid on e.g. Nav1.5, KCNQ1 and hERG is in line with the effects on QTc prolongation observed 
in human studies (mean ΔΔQTcN estimated as 4.9 ms at Cmax of 200 mg daily dose) as well as the QT 
interval prolongation induced by pretomanid in monkeys. It is agreed that further non-clinical studies 
are not warranted since such animal data is not likely to contribute to the overall human benefit/risk 
assessment of cardiac safety. In addition, non-clinical safety results are superseded by available data 
from clinical ECG studies. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic profile of pretomanid is in general considered to have been 
adequately characterized. Rats and monkeys were chosen as target species for the toxicology studies. 
These species showed extensive metabolism and it has been shown that all human circulating 
extractable metabolites detected following a single oral dose of pretomanid were formed in the 
relevant toxicological animal species and that they are adequately qualified in rats and monkeys 
following repeated administration.  
The AUC0-24h of un-extractable radioactivity in plasma of humans following a single dose was however 
estimated to represent more than 10% of the AUC0-24h of total radioactivity which, due to the long half-
life of 18 days, is expected to increase at steady state. Thus, qualification of the un-extractable 
metabolites in non-clinical species is warranted. As analyses of the bound radioactivity could only 
identify 3 of several peaks in the chromatograms, the identities and relative amounts of each 
metabolite bound to human plasma proteins are unknown, as well as the half-lives of all individual 
plasma bound metabolites. It was therefore considered adequate to use the AUC and half-life for the 
un-extractable radioactivity for evaluation of non-clinical qualification of the metabolites bound to 
plasma proteins. i.e. whether the AUC of un-extractable radioactivity during a dosing interval at steady 
state in a toxicological species represent at least 50% of the exposure in humans.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 30/121 
 
  
 
 
The human exposure to pretomanid metabolites at steady state following the proposed dosing regimen 
of 200 mg pretomanid once daily (AUCtau,ss) was predicted by using the accumulation ratios 
determined for pretomanid and estimated for total radioactivity based on the t1/2, respectively (see 
Section Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism Plasma). Corresponding steady state exposures were calculated 
for rats and monkeys in the repeated toxicity studies by using an accumulation ratio of 1 for 
pretomanid (no significant accumulation was observed for pretomanid) and of 2.9 in rats and 9.1 in 
monkeys for total radioactivity (based on the shortest half-life of 40 and 149 h, respectively, obtained 
for total radioactivity). From 100 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in monkeys, the predicted AUCtau,ss 
values for un-extractable radioactivity (1005 and 747 µgxh/mL, respectively) represented at least 50% 
of the exposure in humans (when using the corrected human AUCtau,ss). Metabolites bound to plasma 
proteins are thus considered sufficiently qualified in relevant toxicological species and studies 
(including studies of general toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity [ongoing study in rats 
will be provided when available]).  
Toxicology 
Pretomanid shows clear signs of toxicological effects on male rodent reproductive organs without any 
safety margin. The findings were only partially reversible. In rodents, the usual pattern of hormone 
alteration after a toxicant exposure that targets the seminiferous epithelium and produces germ cell 
loss leading to testicular atrophy is a progressive increase in FSH and LH, a decrease in InhB, and little 
or no change in testosterone. The data in the preclinical studies are consistent with this pattern of 
serum levels of male reproductive hormones. Generally, serum levels of male reproductive hormones 
are biomarkers of testicular injury that are altered as a compensatory response after the onset of the 
injury; therefore, the Applicant do not expect them to be changed early during treatment and to 
precede testicular injury. This is agreed. No clear mechanism behind the pretomanid-induced rodent 
testicular toxicity was provided, although oxidative stress was hypothetised. Testicular findings (i.e. 
sperm abnormalities) were also found in mature monkeys, but at a significantly lower degree than in 
rodents. The Applicant considers the findings of decreased sperm motility and total sperm count, and 
increased abnormal sperm ratio in the cynomolgus to be secondary to decreased food consumption 
and significant weight loss rather than direct effects of pretomanid on testes because the majority of 
these changes disappeared after recovery of physical condition, and there were no histopathological 
correlates in the male genital organs. Direct effects of pretomanid is not considered to be clearly ruled 
out. Sufficient clinical information regarding the effect of pretomanid on human male reproduction 
organs is not available. Due to the observed testicular toxicity, male reproductive hormones were 
studied in clinical Studies NC 002, NC-005, and NC 006, which showed no evidence of treatment-
associated testicular toxicity. It was concluded that the available clinical data does not raise concern 
that pretomanid may cause testicular toxicity in the proposed regimen.  Applicant is planning a Male 
Reproductive Safety Study that will evaluate sperm parameters. This is supported. 
Lens fibre swelling was seen in several studies in rats and monkeys with and without cataracts. In 
some of the study reports the swelling of lens fibres were interpreted as artefacts caused by the 
fixation fluid (Davidson’s fluid), since the fixative, according to the applicant, is known to sometimes 
cause cell swelling during tissue preparation. However, in the 3-month monkey study, the lens fibre 
changes correlated with clinical observations of cataract and were not typical of artefacts caused by 
Davidson’s fixative. Similar, in the 26-week rat study, the lens fibre swelling generally correlated with 
the in-life ophthalmic examination identification of cataracts. In some pathologic conditions, such as 
diabetes, osmotic stress may develop due to accumulation of certain molecules in the eye. This may 
again lead to cataract formation and extensive swelling of cortical lens fibres (Kelkar et al. 2018; 
Pollreisz et al. 2010). There is a clear species difference in the cataract induction with the rat being 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 31/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
more susceptible than the monkey and the mouse (where no cataracts were observed). It also appears 
to be individual differences in susceptibility as shown in the difficulty to study the onset and recovery 
of cataracts in the performed repeat-dose studies. In a CHMP scientific advice it was recommend that 
the Applicant should further study the mechanism for cataract development in the rat. Such study has 
not been performed. The applicant is of the opinion that lens swelling is not related to cataract 
development, since only four out of nine animals in the 26-week rat study had microscopic lens fiber 
swelling, and two females with lens swelling did not have cataracts. It is not agreed that these data 
show a lack of relation between cataract and lens swelling. The results are considered as equivocal. 
According to the applicant, few of the over 1100 subjects in clinical studies administered pretomanid 
for over 6 months, had findings related to cataract formation and lens abnormalities. In conclusion, 
even though the mechanisms for cataract development in rats and monkeys is still unclear, 
considerable clinical experience suggest that the risk of cataract development in patients following 
treatment with pretomanid is low.  
Signs of immunotoxicity were seen in most of the repeat-dose toxicity studies and in all three species, 
such as lymphoid depletion in the spleen, thymus, Peyer’s patches and bronchial-associated lymphoid 
tissue in the lungs, and alterations in lymphoid organ weights. The applicant refers to publications 
showing that stress can have an impact on the immune system at dose levels producing overt toxicity. 
With pretomanid, adverse immunological changes were only observed in animals at toxic dose levels. 
Thus, the applicant is of the opinion that the immunological changes were caused by stress associated 
with administration of high doses of pretomanid. This assumption seems plausible. However, stress 
induced immunological responses do not exclude that other mechanisms also may cause such adverse 
events.  
The applicant states that a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in the rat is ongoing. A genotoxic concern 
based on the positive mutagenicity results of the M50 metabolite cannot at this point be excluded. 
However, based on the absence of pre-neoplastic or neoplastic findings in the chronic toxicity studies 
in the rat, or in the 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice combined with the severity of the 
indication (extensively drug resistant or treatment-intolerant/nonresponsive multidrug-resistant  
tuberculosis) and the observed positive therapeutic effect it is accepted that this study is submitted as 
a post marketing commitment. The applicant has committed to submit this study once available.  
Oral administration of pretomanid at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day elicited cutaneous reactions indicative of 
phototoxicity (erythema, grade 1 barely perceptible light redness). The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) for phototoxicity in this study was 30 mg/kg/day indicating an exposure margin of 1.5- 
to 3-fold. The findings of cutaneous erythema was of low incidence, low severity, rapidly reversible and 
observed only at doses that exceed human doses and anticipated human exposures. The event of 
erythema was searched throughout the entire clinical safety datasets of the pretomanid clinical studies. 
Erythema occurred only in four subjects in phase 1 studies and out of 1153 subjects exposed to 
pretomanid. In the Nix-TB study, where pretomanid was used for as long as 6-9 months, there was no 
single event of erythema, no drug discontinuation due to skin event, nor any of the severe forms of 
skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson Syndrome) were reported. It is concluded that the clinical 
relevance is minimal. There were no AEs in the clinical safety data set that were considered to 
represent allergic and/or indicative of immunotoxicity.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis  
Plasma concentrations of pretomanid were initially determined by a HPLC-MS/MS following liquid-liquid 
extraction and using triazolam as internal standard. A sample volume of 50 µL K2EDTA plasma was 
used. The calibration range was 10-10000 ng/ml. The assay was validated and cross-validated in 
heparin plasma. Further partial validation was performed following transfer of the assay. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 33/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The initial assay was further developed and validated by using an UPLC/with MS/MS detection following 
liquid-liquid extraction. The calibration range was 10-10000 ng/ml and deuterium-labelled-pretomanid 
was used as internal standard. 
An assay for simultaneous determination of pretomanid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin in plasma by 
using LC-MS/MS detection was developed and validated. Plasma samples with heparin as anticoagulant 
was used and sample preparation by protein precipitation. d5-pretomanid, 15N,d3-pyrazinamide and 
d4-moxifloxacin was used as internal standard for pretomanid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin, 
respectively. 
During analysis of study samples from the phase-2 study NC-005, determining plasma levels of 
pretomanid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin simultaneously by a validated UPLC-MS/MS method, ISR 
(incurred sample reanalysis) criteria failed for all three analytes. The assay working procedures was 
changed/redeveloped. The method was then re-validated. 
An analytical assay for simultaneous determination pretomanid, bedaquiline/N-monodesmethyl 
bedaquiline and linezolid in heparin plasma by LC-MS/MS was validated. The analytes and the internal 
standards were isolated from the biological matrix by protein precipitation. d5-pretomanid, d6-
bedaquiline and d3-linezolid were used as internal standards. 
A bioanalytical method for determination of pretomanid in the urine was developed and validated. 
Urine concentration was determined by HPLC with MS/MS detection using a sample volume of 100 µL 
and triazolam as internal standard. 
Absorption 
The absorption was rather slow with a tmax of ca 5h following single oral doses of pretomanid in fasted 
condition. 
Total exposure and Cmax increased in a linear manner with dose but less than dose proportionally up to 
1000 mg and then levelled off. 
Steady state was reached after ca 5-6 days with a RAC≈2 following repeated dosing once daily. A less 
than dose-proportional increase in plasma levels was seen. 
Co-administration with food resulted in about a 1.9- and 1.5-fold higher exposure of pretomanid after 
200 mg and 50 mg, respectively, compared to when administered in fasted state. The increase in 
exposure was ca 4-fold following co-administered pretomanid 1000 mg with food compared to fasted 
state. The clinically recommended dose for pretomanid is 200 mg od. 
Distribution 
The fu (unbound fraction) was determined to 13.6% and independent of plasma concentration in the 
studied concentration range 0.5-12 μg/ml (1.4-33 μM).  
The of fu of [14C]pretomanid in HAS (human serum albumin) was calculated to 17.3% indicating that 
binding to albumin is responsible for the plasma protein binding of pretomanid. 
The blood-to-plasma ratio of pretomanid in human blood was determined to about 0.75. 
There is no knowledge about pretomanid distribution to tissues of therapeutic interest (lung, epithelial 
lining fluid, sputum). 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 34/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The t1/2 ranged between 15-20h. 
The total recovery of radioactivity was 90 and 91% following an oral dose of [benzyl-14C]-pretomanid 
873 mg and [imidazooxazinele-14C]-pretomanid 1100 mg, respectively. Ca 70-75% of the dose was 
excreted within the first four days. The t1/2 of plasma radioactivity was calculated to 17 days. 
About 55-65% of the radioactive dose was excreted in the urine and about 25-40% in faeces. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
The metabolic turnover of pretomanid was low in human liver microsomes (HLM) and hepatocytes. 
Four radioactive components were characterized, M10, M20, M50 and M13, following 2-h incubations in 
HLM. Eleven metabolites were detected after 4-h incubations in hepatocyte. Six metabolites (M37, 
M42, M10, M11, M20 and M43) each represented ≥1% of total radioactivity in the incubates. M11 was 
the major metabolite produced. 
Pretomanid was metabolically stable with almost no detectable loss of parent compound in incubations 
with recombinant CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6. CYP3A4 seemed to be involved, with 80% of parent 
compound remaining after a 60-min incubation. 
The reactions involved in the elimination pathways of pretomanid and its metabolites are nitro-
reduction, oxidations; including oxidative dealkylation and oxidative deamination, and conjugations; 
including glycine, glucuronide, and glutathione. 
There is no evidence of chiral interconversion based on in vitro data from human hepatocytes and 
preclinical data. 
Bacterial contribution to pretomanid metabolism 
Nitro-reduction within gastrointestinal microflora and MTB are involved in the metabolism of 
pretomanid.  
• 
Pretomanid enters MTB and is there converted to desnitro pretomanid. Bioreduction of 
pretomanid’s aromatic nitro group is part of the activation of pretomanid within the target 
MTB.  
•  Six other metabolic products has been detected within the bacteria, named 2, 3, and M1 – M4. 
It is not clear whether these are released from the MTB; indeed, M3 is putatively a precursor to 
desnitro pretomanid as well as M1 and M4.  
•  Because of their well-known capacity for such nitro-reduction, gut microflora may thereby be 
implicated in pretomanid metabolism. It is likely that pretomanid enters gut bacteria where it 
is converted into one or more nitro-reduced species that are then released from the bacteria. 
However, more detailed characterization is not available.  
It is unknown whether any pretomanid molecules that enter bacteria are released unchanged 
from the bacteria. 
• 
•  Although intestinal flora are likely involved in pre-systemic metabolism of pretomanid, 
quantitative effects on systemic exposure have not been definitively characterized.  
o  Nitro-reduction products of pretomanid were detected in feces in human mass balance 
studies.  
o  The detection in the urine of M29, the initial nitro-reduction product, as well as some of 
its downstream products, suggests that metabolites of gut bacteria may be absorbed 
systemically, although there is also evidence of hepatic nitro-reduction. 
Urine and faces 
The metabolic profiling following a single oral dose of either [benzyl-14C]-pretomanid or 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 35/121 
 
  
 
 
[imidazooxazine-14C]-pretomanid) has identified more than 20 minor metabolites in urine and faces 
excreta. Ca 60% of the dose was characterized after [benzyl-14C]-pretomanid and 40% after 
[imidazooxazine-14C]-pretomanid). 
Pretomanid was extensively metabolized as only a very low percentage of the dose was excreted as 
unchanged compound, <0.5% in the urine and <2% in faeces. 
Several radioactive peaks were detected in urine and faeces. Following administration of [benzyl-14C]-
pretomanid, M11 was the largest metabolite in the urine ca 13% of the radioactive dose and M26, 
M8/M10 and M13 each represented ca 5% of the dose. A number of radioactive peaks were identified 
in faeces but all represented <3% of the radioactive dose each. 
After [imidazooxazine-14C]-pretomanid) 15 minor metabolites were characterized in the urine each 
accounting for <5% of the radioactive dose. In faeces were 31 radioactive peaks detected and 12 
minor metabolites, each accounting for <2% of the dose. 
Plasma 
The concentration of total radioactivity in plasma and blood was much higher than the plasma 
concentration of pretomanid. The t1/2 of total plasma radioactivity was calculated to ca 18 days 
compared to 16h for pretomanid. Pretomanid represented 29% of total plasma radioactivity at Cmax 
and ca 80, 55 and 2.5% of radioactivity AUC0-24h, AUC0-48h and AUCtotal, respectively. 
The extraction efficiency of 14C-related material from plasma samples decreased with time (see 
Figure 2). Unextractable radioactivity associated with plasma proteins might be the reason to the long 
t1/2 of 18 days for total plasma radioactivity.

unextractable plasma radioactivity in CL-008 Study. Note: Source: CL-008, Table 11-4; extracted 
(acetonitrile) and unextracted radioactivity profiles are derived from extraction efficiency (CL-008, 
Section 16.2.5.3).  
The exposures listed in Table 8 were used for the qualification of the different components of 
radioactivity, including an accumulation ratio of 2 for pretomanid (according to the dose-proportionality 
study) and 26 for total radioactivity (RAc based on t1/2 of 18 days).

The three most abundant metabolites detected, during the first 24h post dose, were M27, M50, and 
M52 representing 8, 6 and 5% compared to the exposure of pretomanid. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A less than dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure of pretomanid was seen following single 
doses of 50-1500 mg as well as after repeated dosing of 200 and 600 mg od. 
Time dependency 
No signs of time dependency were seen following 200 and 600 mg od in the MAD-study (CL-002). 
PK in target population 
The reference subject is: 55 kg, male, HIV-, DS-TB subject with baseline TBIL of 5 μmol/L and ALB of 
35 g/L administered 200 mg qd of pretomanid alone in a fed condition for 8 weeks. The geometric 
mean (CV%) Cavg,ss for this subject is 2.37 µg/mL (32.8%). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment

Hepatic impairment 
No data have been provided. A study in subjects with hepatic impairment is ongoing. 
Gender, race, weight, elderly 
Clearance and volume of distribution scaled allometrically with weight. Apparent clearance in females 
was 18% less than in males according to the popPK model. 
Age did not influence pretomanid PK over the age range investigated (18-77 years, five subjects ≥65 
years in the popPK dataset). There is limited data on pretomanid PK in the elderly. 
According to NCA analyses, Black, Mixed and White races had similar systemic exposure. There was a 
tendency towards higher exposure in Asian subjects, however, the data are limited (five Asian subjects 
with rich PK sampling across the development program). 
None of the differences identified between subpopulations appears to warrant any differentiation of the 
dose.

In vivo 
• 
• 
The exposure of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was 0.85-fold when co-administered with 
pretomanid (CYP3A4 - inhibitor GI-tract, TDI signal, induction potential)  
The exposure of pretomanid was  
- 0.45-fold when co-administered with rifampicin (enzyme and transporter inducer, OATP1B1, 
  inhibitor) 
- 0.75-fold following co-treatment with efavirenz (inducer of CYP3A4 and a CYP3A4 inhibitor) 
- 0.85-fold when dosed together with lopinavir (inducer of CYP450)/ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
  an inducer of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19) 
•  Conclusion 
A clinically relevant decrease in systemic exposure of pretomanid was seen when co-administered 
with rifampicin and efavirenz thus pretomanid should not be co-treated with strong and moderate 
CYP inducers (SmPC 4.5). 
No clinically relevant effect on midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was seen when co-administered with 
pretomanid (CYP3A4 - inhibitor GI-tract, TDI signal, induction potential), however, potential effect 
on other PXR mediated enzymes, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, in vivo is unclear. 
Population PK modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects 
modelling. Data were combined across 14 of the studies in the pretomanid development programme, 
constituting a total of 17725 observations from 1054 subjects. The purposes of the analysis were 
generally descriptive, with the main aim to identify important covariates and serve as basis for 
estimation of exposure metrics for exposure-response investigations. Absorption was described using 
three transit compartments and dose-dependent bioavailability, while disposition was described using a 
one-compartment model. A total of 33 covariate-parameter relationships were considered necessary to 
describe the combined data adequately.  
Exposure-response relationships 
No reliable exposure-response relationships have been characterized.

Concentration-QTc modelling was performed based on pooled data from across studies. For pretomanid 
monotherapy, a rich dataset was available, and a linear increase in QTc was estimated as a function of 
pretomanid concentration. For the BPaL regimen, limited data were available, with no data at 
pretomanid concentrations >~5 ug/mL. The final model for the BPaL regimen described a linear 
increase in QTcN (using a data-specific correction) as a function of both pretomanid concentration and 
bedaquline M2 concentration. With pretomanid at a concentration of 3.2 µg/mL (mean estimated Cmax 
at 200 mg od) and with bedaquiline M2 at a concentration of 0.25 µg/mL (mean observed M2 
concentration in Nix-TB), the mean ΔΔQTcN (upper 90% CI) was estimated as 9.5 ms (10.8 ms). 
Including a “secular trend” estimated from all the trials, ΔQTcN for the BPaL regimen would be 13.6 
(14.9 ms). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pretomanid is a new chemical entity and a member of the nitroimidazooxazines class, whereas 
delamanid is a member of the nitroimidazooxaole class). The mechanism of action seems complex and 
has not been fully elucidated. Under aerobic conditions, pretomanid appears to inhibit MTB cell wall 
biosynthesis by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid, while under anaerobic conditions, it generates 
reactive nitrogen species.  
In some further detail, for bactericidal action, activation of an aromatic nitro group is required, 
accomplished through an oxygen-sensitive bioreduction in the milieu found in microbes, but not in 
mammalian cells. The reaction, involving the transfer of two electrons, is dependent on three 
enzymes:  a co-factor F420 (8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin), an F420-dependent nitroreductase encoded 
ddn, and an F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded fgd1. 
Mutations in genes encoding for either Ddn, Fgd1, or the F420 biosynthetic pathway (fbiA, fbiB, or 
fbiC) result in high-level resistance (discussed in a coming section). 
Following activation, pretomanid inhibits cell wall production by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid, 
a process mainly affecting replicating bacteria. However, studies in a variety of in vitro models also 
provide evidence for a prominent effect on non-replicating MTB. Activated pretomanid yields NO-
production, which may be the key to this action, where NO targets ATP synthase (energy production) 
as well as DNA and multiple enzymes within the MTB. 
In vitro, in vivo activity, resistance and secondary pharmacology 
In vitro activity 
In vitro activity – MTB, aerobic conditions 
The effect in vitro has been studied by a number of groups over the years, with the use of different 
assays (Stover 2000, Feuerriegel 2011, Upton 2015, the TBA-354-NLCN-072A study). The MIC-range 
was fully similar in these studies, ranging 000.5 to 0.48 µg/ml regardless of resistance classification 
(i.e DS-, MDR- and XDR-TB isolates).  Of note, isolates with mutations known to yield resistance to 
pretomanid have MIC values of ≥16 µg/ml (below). 
The Pretomanid-NCLN-MICRO-004 study evaluated the activity of pretomanid using different methods: 
MGIT, REMA and agar proportion. In this study, 35 patient isolates from the NC-006 trial (discussed in 
efficacy/safety section), 2 pretomanid-resistant mutants, 14A1 and T3; and MTB H37Rv (control) were 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 40/121 
 
  
 
 
evaluated using independent inocula over three different dates in the same testing laboratory. The 
MGIT results in this comparison were from a previous study (Pretomanid-NCLN-MICRO-003); the REMA 
results were from the NC-006 trial. In this comparison, there was a method-dependent difference in 
MIC values, in the order agar, REMA and MGIT, where MICs by MGIT were typically 2 to 4-fold higher 
than the REMA-results. 
In vitro activity– MTB, anaerobic conditions 
The in vitro activity under anaerobic conditions, with and without acidification, and efficacy against 
intracellular MTB (in whole blood experiments) has also been studied and results published by a 
number of groups.  Results are not presented in any detail. In summary, bactericidal activity was 
shown also against non-replicating MTB under conditions including hypoxia, microaerophila and 
acidified hypoxia. Intracellular activity in mouse macrophages was demonstrated in the 2018-
Pretomanid In Vitro Anti-TB Activity Study 1. However, in two other studies investigating intracellular 
activity (Wallis et al. 2012 and Matsumoto et al. 2006), pretomanid displayed antagonistic effect to 
bedaquiline and sutezolid and was inferior to rifampicin and delamanid. The results of the three studies 
were discussed. There is firm documentation from study A and B that pretomanid alone is effective 
against intracellular MTB. The antagonistic effect observed for one of the conditions with pretomanid, 
bedaquline and sutezolid in study C, was deemed to be explained by a low concentration of 
pretomanid. Results obtained in the mouse and guinea pig models confirms a satisfactorily intracellular 
effect of the 3-drug regimen. 
In vitro activity –other mycobacterial species and other bacteria 
Among tested mycobacterial species besides MTB, M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. pinnipedi were 
susceptible, with MICs from ≤0.0312 to 0.125 μg/mL. MICs for M. ulcerans ranged ≤4 to >16 μg/mL 
(which would be considered resistant).  
MICs were not measurable against M. avium, M. phlei, M. smegmatis, M. fortuitum or M. kansasii.  
M. leprae is naturally resistant as well (it lacks a functional ddn gene, needed for activation of 
pretomanid). 
Pretomanid lacks activity against other aerobic bacteria and yeast including E. coli, S. aureus, and C. 
albicans; however, it does display some activity against a small number of Gram-positive and Gram-
negative anaerobic bacteria, with MICs in the range of 1 to 32 μg/mL. 
In vivo activity 
In vivo activity in Murine Models of tuberculosis 
Pretomanid has been evaluated in several murine models of TB, as monotherapy and in combination 
with a variety of first- and second-line TB drugs, including compounds in clinical development.  For 
most, the MTB strain H37Rv was used. For all but one study, aerosol infection of mice was used; in 
that study, mice were infected via the intravenous route. Efficacy was generally assessed by CFU 
counts in lungs and/or spleens, either at the end of the treatment period (assessment of bactericidal 
activity), or 12 weeks after completion of treatment, to assess relapse (sterilizing capacity). A large 
number of studies by various investigators have been performed (Stover 2000, Tyagi 2005, Lenaerts 
2005, Lannoix 2014, Li 2016). These were summarized by the applicant in an extensive review. In 
addition to studies in mice, a few studies were also performed in guinea pigs; results in that species 
was similar to that in mice and are not further commented. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 41/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In brief summary, Pa dosed 25 mg/kg yielded similar effect in an acute model as INH control (25 
mg/kg).  
The minimal effective dose (the lowest dose that prevents development of gross lung lesions and 
splenomegaly) and minimal bactericidal dose (the lowest dose that reduces lung CFU burdens by 99% 
compared to pretreatment) was found to be 12.5 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, in aerosol infected 
mice.  
Also in a latent TB model (low aerosol inoculum, with treatment starting 6 weeks later) results with Pa 
were similar to that seen with INH.  
A number of different Pa-containing regimens have been evaluated in mice. Three regimens have been 
studied in the clinical studies, the BPaMZ, BPaZ and BPaL regimens (efficacy section). The agents 
included have been evaluated in monotherapy and in different combinations by Li et al (publication 
2016) and the TB Alliance, tables below.   
In the study by Li et al, table below, the challenge dose was 3.5-4.0 log10 CFU, and treatment (5 days 
per week) started 14 days post challenge. Bactericidal activity was assessed by studying CFU counts in 
lung tissue up to 3 months of treatment, whereas relapse was assessed 3 months after completion of 
1, 1.5, 2, 3, or 4 months of treatment (sterilizing capacity).

The B-Pa-M-Z regimen is presently evaluated in the NC-008 study (discussed in efficacy section), 
where both DS-TB (here as a means to shorten therapy) and MDR-TB patients are included. The added 
activity of pyrazinamide is clear in the mice model. This may question to what extent pyrazinamide can 
be justified as part of a standardized MDR-TB regimen: at least in the high epidemic setting more than 
half of MDR-TB patients were reported to have baseline isolates harbouring pyrazinamide resistance. 
Two studies performed for the TB Alliance (Johns Hopkins University) evaluated the bactericidal activity 
of Pa, B and L in all types of combinations (of relevance for the pivotal study, Nix-TB and ZeNix). The 
doses used in these studies were pretomanid (100 mg/kg), bedaquiline (25 mg/kg), and linezolid (100 
mg/kg), rifampicin (10 mg/kg), isoniazid (10 mg/kg), and pyrazinamide (150 mg/kg). The exposures 
obtained with that dosing of bedaquiline and linezolid are relevant for the exposures achieved in the 
clinical trials. 
Mice where challenged with aerosol (~4.2 log10 CFU), and treatment started 2 weeks thereafter. 
Results (similar between studies) are shown below for the larger of the two experiments. This study 
clearly indicates that all 3 drugs in the BPaL regimen (the regimen of main interest for this application) 
clearly contribute to the efficacy of the combination, next table.

In a third study from Johns Hopkins (2016, expt 3a) also relapse frequency was evaluated for the BPaL 
regimen versus that obtained with control (RIF, INH and pyrazinamide given for 4 months). Following 
3 months of therapy, the relapse rate with control was 7/15 versus 1/15 with the BPaL regimen given 
for 3 months.  Two months of BPaL treatment resulted in relapse in 4/15.  
Exposure response in mice 
Ahmad et al (2011) studied exposure response in an acute mouse model with various dosing schedules 
over 24 days, with log CFU reduction in lung tissue as the end point. In brief, these experiments 
showed that free drug time over MIC had the best correlation to effect (R2 = 0.87), followed by 
fAUC/MIC (R2 = 0.60) (time over MIC being the cumulative percentage of the dosing interval that the 
drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady state conditions, and fAUC (the area under the 
concentration time curve for free, unbound drug). 
Ahmad et al. also concluded that T>MIC greater than 48% is needed for a 1-log10 kill, and T>MIC 
above 77% is near-maximal bactericidal effect. The EBACFUs observed in the phase 2 clinical trials for 
doses of 100 mg and above, are comparable to the maximal kill rate demonstrated in mice treated 
with 96 mg/kg twice daily.  
Resistance 
Mechanism of resistance 
In general resistance to TB drugs arises via chromosomal mutations, linked to a spontaneous error rate 
of 1 per 10.000-100.000 per round of replication, and the lack of a mismatch repair system.  
The mechanism of pretomanid resistance has been studied by several groups, using different 
methodologies.  The mutation rate has been studied in so called fluctuation analyses, spontaneous 
mutation resistance studies and in serial passage studies.  When summing up the results, the in vitro 
rate of mutations causing pretomanid resistance was around 10-7, and quite dependent on the size of 
the inoculum.  
Resistance selection studies has also been done in vivo, looking at mice exposed to pretomanid where 
comparisons have been made on mutations seen here as compared to those reported from mentioned 
in vitro studies. In summary, in resistant strains a number of point mutations are found in 5 different 
genes coding for the three enzymes that have been postulated to activate pretomanid (see section 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 43/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action). The 5 genes are the following, encoding for either Ddn, Fgd1, or the F420 
biosynthetic pathway (fbiA, fbiB, or fbiC): 
• 
• 
• 
ddn (also called Rv3547), 
fgd1 (also called Rv0407), and  
three genes encoding for co-factor F420: fbi A (Rv3261), fbiB (Rv3262) and fbiC 
(Rv1173). 
Precise MICs were not determined for these mutations, but MICs >3.6 µg/mL (highest exposure 
tested) were in practice yielded by all mutations. 
In these studies (large number of strains tested), mutations in these genes accounted for the 
resistance in around 80% of pretomanid resistant isolates; around 20% of isolates were wild type (in 
these 5 genes), indicating that other cellular functions may be involved in the resistance to 
pretomanid. 
Two studies (mice model) performed at Johns Hopkins for the Alliance (JHU 2017 3d-1 and 3d-2) also 
evaluated potential remaining activity of pretomanid in the presence of pretomaind resistance (H37Rv 
ddn mutant with a MIC of ≥16 µg/mL). Two weeks post challenge, the mice were treated with 
pretomanid alone (doses 50 and 100 mg/kg) and in various combinations with bedaquiline, linezolid, 
moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide.  On the basis of the results in this study, no remaining activity can be 
expected from pretomanid in the presence of such (high level) resistance, neither when pretomanid 
was given in monotherapy, nor when it was added to other combinations.  
Cross resistance to other TB agents 
As summarized previously, MICs were fully similar in DS-, MDR- and XDR-TB isolates, i.e. there is no 
signal for a reduced susceptibility to pretomanid in isolates resistant to other TB agents in these 
studies. Baseline MICs in the phase 2/3 studies of this application will be discussed further below. 
The other way around, looking at pretomanid laboratory-derived resistant mutants, cross resistance 
was seen towards delamanid, but not towards other TB agents.  Cross resistance to delamanid is 
generally expected (and was observed in all but one pretomanid-resistant mutant), since delamanid 
shares the same activation pathway as pretomanid.   
Resistance in vivo (phase 2 and 3) 
Pretomanid MIC values at baseline and in case of failure (phase 2 and 3) 
For the phase 2 studies, the applicant notifies that adequate laboratory practices were not in place 
prior to the start of these studies (realized by the applicant post-hoc), and that baseline MIC values in 
these studies need to be interpreted with caution. That included the large NC-005 study, where 
baseline MICs cannot be reported.  
However, pretomanid MIC data obtained at baseline and at post-baseline visits is available from NC-
002 study (8 weeks study, n = 148). Samples were examined for presence of high MIC values at 
baseline, evidence of primary (or pre-existing resistance), and for shifts in MIC values between 
baseline and post-baseline visits. None of this was seen; the pretomanid MICs at baseline ranged from 
< 0.025 to 0.2 μg/mL, (MIC50 = 0.05 μg/mL and MIC90 = 0.1 μg/mL for all treatment arms), which is 
in the range of values obtained for presumed pretomanid susceptible strains tested using a similar 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 44/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
methodology (Study TBA-354-NCLN-072-A). No pretomanid MIC shift from baseline to post-baseline 
greater than 4-fold was observed. 
Data are also available from NC-006 (STAND, phase 3, DS TB) and the Nix-TB study (pivotal, 
MDR/XDR-TB). 
In NC-006, MIC determinations from isolates captured at baseline and at/after end of treatment were 
done by REMA method, and in addition whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed (Central lab, 
London). Following a repeated analysis, excluding isolates that had been contaminated with non-MTB 
mycobacteria, baseline resistance to pretomanid was seen in 2/213 baseline isolates tested (MIC>4 
µg/ml for both isolates). One of the isolates had a mutation in the ddn gene, analysis of the second 
isolate was ongoing at the time of submission. Both subjects (one treated with control regimen, one 
with Pa-containing test regimen) had a favourable treatment outcome. Elevated pretomanid MIC 
values were not observed in any of the post Week 17 isolates, indicating no pretomanid resistance 
development, table below. There was no significance for baseline pretomanid MICs and treatment 
outcomes. In summary, there was no association between pretomanid baseline MICs and outcome, 
and no case of pretomanid resistance development was captured.

Note: Three out of the 5 baseline isolates with a MIC ≥4 were found to be wrong (including 
contamination with non-MTB species) in a subsequent re-analysis. 
In the Nix-TB study, pure MTB cultures obtained at baseline (Day 1, or Screening to Week 4 if Day 1 
cultures were negative or contaminated) were analysed in the central London laboratory. Pretomanid, 
bedaquiline and linezolid MIC values were analysed using the MGIT method, and whole pairwise 
genome sequencing was performed. 
Available baseline isolates (n=38 out of 109 subjects) were susceptible to pretomanid, as well as to 
bedaquiline and linezolid, according to the cut-offs used (those recommended for MGIT by WHO 2018 
= 1 µg/mL for both agents). 
In the few isolates (n=4) obtained from 16 weeks post baseline or onwards, there were none with a 
fold shift to pretomanid or linezolid. One isolate developed bedaquiline resistance (baseline MIC 0.12 
μg/ml versus 4 μg/mL at relapse 3 months post EOT). Sequencing revealed the development of 
mutation in the Rv0678 gene, associated to bedaquiline resistance, not present in the baseline isolate. 
Details on this patient (and others with relapse) are provided in the clinical efficacy section.

Positive baseline cultures (or at screening up to 4 weeks prior to day 1) are available for 93/109 
subjects (85%), and 16/109 had a negative culture (this data is presented in the Efficacy section). 
Baseline MIC determinations were achieved for 58/93 (62%) (updated data during the procedure).  In 
practice all isolates that did not grow for MIC determinations (34/35) had been handled at one 
laboratory, i.e. a lab without proper quality of methods. This laboratory is no longer part of ongoing 
studies, procedures have been further quality controlled and MIC determinations in the ongoing ZeNix 
study is presently running as planned.  
Secondary pharmacology 
QTc prolongation 
The effect of pretomanid as monotherapy on QTc prolongation was studied in a thorough QT (TQT)-
study (DMID-0058). Pretomanid exerted a mild effect on QTc prolongation (estimated placebo-
adjusted change from baseline 4.4 ms [upper 90% CI 6.1 ms] at a pretomanid concentration of 2.3 
µg/mL). Important concerns with this study were that pretomanid was only tested at systemic 
exposure approximately similar to that expected for the proposed clinical dose, i.e. without margins 
(mean Cmax after the 1000 mg pretomanid single dose in the QT-study was 2.3 µg/mL, while it was 
3.1 µg/mL in the Nix-TB study) and that the relevant pretomanid+bedaquiline combination was not 
tested. Therefore, the results from the TQT study cannot be considered fully relevant, neither for 
pretomanid monotherapy nor for the BPaL regimen, and is considered inconclusive. However, a 
multiple dose pretomanid thorough QT study would not provide very useful information. The sum effect

of the BPaL regimen is of main interest, where a thorough QT study (versus placebo in healthy 
volunteers) of bedaquiline plus pretomanid in combination is not feasible, having in mind the time to 
steady state and prolonged time to maximum QT prolongation seen for bedaquiline. ECGs were taken 
throughout the Nix-TB study, and although this study does not allow for a more precise estimate of 
mean QTc prolongation, very few patients did have QTc increases of a magnitude associated with a 
substantial risk of arrythmias. Strict and clear recommendations on how to handle QTc prolongation 
during therapy with the B-Pa-L regimen is provided in the pretomanid SmPC. 
Serum creatinine 
Pretomanid treatment leads to increased serum creatinine, but apparently not a change in GFR as 
measured by iohexol clearance (Study CL-005). The Applicant suggests this is attributable to inhibition 
of tubular secretion of creatinine. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pretomanid is a small molecule with one chiral centre, the Pretomanid FGK product consist of the 
S-isomer. Pretomanid was practical insoluble at physiological pH (BCS2). 
Plasma concentrations of pretomanid was determined by validated LC/MS/MS methods either as a 
separate analyte or simultaneously with bedaquiline/linezolid or pyrazinamide/moxifloxacin following 
co-treatment. Where available, within study validations of the bioanalytical assays seem appropriate 
for the intended purpose. One bioanalysis report (DDI study A5306) including within study validation 
was missing and could not be provided since it had never been written. The issue was not further 
pursued.  
During analysis of study samples from the phase-2 study NC-005, determining plasma levels of 
pretomanid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin simultaneously by a validated UPLC-MS/MS method, ISR 
(incurred sample reanalysis) criteria failed for all three analytes. Investigations concluded that the best 
way to alleviate the ISR issue was to change the working procedures/redevelop the assay. The method 
was then re-validated, and all reported results were generated using the re-validated method.  
The effect of food on the bioavailability of pretomanid is considerable, especially at higher doses. This 
is expected for an oral solid drug product for which the rate of absorption is limited by the solubility in 
the GI-tract (presence of food/bile acids increase the solubility). The systemic exposure was about 
doubled at the dose intended for marketing (200 mg) when co-administered with food. In the pivotal 
study Nix-TB, pretomanid was administered with food to ensure adequate bioavailability. Non-clinical 
data show no effect of a high fat/calorie breakfast intake compared to without in monkeys, while in 
another study, bioavailability was higher in fasted compared in fed animals (cf Non-clinical AR). 
Surprisingly the effect of food on pretomanid bioavailability seems to be opposite in humans and 
monkeys, which could be attributed to pH variations. The food effect needs to be considered when 
assessing the outcomes of the clinical studies. For instance, the QTc study (evaluating doses up to 
1000 mg) was conducted in fasting subjects and due to the saturation of the uptake in fasting state, 
the achieved exposures were low and generally not higher than what was observed after 
administration of the 200 mg at fed conditions.  
The Applicant has suggested that pretomanid could be taken without food without loss of efficacy. 
However, there is currently no reliable evidence that adequate efficacy would be achieved at lower 
exposure than that obtained in Nix-TB. Therefore, the clinical recommendation should be that 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 47/121 
 
  
 
 
 
pretomanid is administered with food. Across the Phase II studies and the Nix-TB study, pretomanid 
was administered with varying instructions regarding time and meal content. Still, exposure in terms of 
mean AUC0-24, ss was relatively stable (range 54-80 µg*h/mL), indicating that the exact food content 
and timing is not crucial. 
Pretomanid was labelled in two different positions [benzyl-14C]-pretomanid and [imidazooxazinele-
14C]-pretomanid to follow/determine metabolites after oral single doses. The concentration of total 
radioactivity in plasma was much higher than the plasma concentration of pretomanid. The t1/2 of total 
plasma radioactivity was calculated to ca 18 days compared to 16h for pretomanid. An implication of 
the large difference in t1/2 between parent compound and radioactivity is that the ratio between 
metabolites and parent compound might change with time, the PK of the metabolites are unknown. 
Pretomanid represented 29% of total plasma radioactivity at Cmax but only 2.5% of total AUC of 
radioactivity. One major metabolite was determined, M19 representing 35% of the systemic exposure 
compared to pretomanid. None of the other detected circulated metabolites, during the first 24h post 
dose, were determined to be as large as 10% of the exposure of parent compound. The three others 
most abundant detected were M27, M50, and M52 representing 8, 6 and 5% compared to the 
exposure of pretomanid. The extraction efficiency of 14C-related material from plasma samples 
decreased with time. Thus, unextractable radioactivity associated with plasma proteins might be the 
reason to the long t1/2 of total plasma radioactivity. The consequences following repeated dosing once 
daily with respect to systemic accumulation of drug related material, considering the long t1/2 (18 
days) of total plasma radioactivity, are unknown. May there be metabolites that have not been 
qualified in the non-clinical setting? The applicant provided a calculation that assumed a fixed ratio of 
parent/metabolites over time, which is not agreed with. After recalculation with the appropriate 
accumulation ratios for pretomanid and total radioactivity, the qualification of metabolites in non-
clinical species was demonstrated for pretomanid, its known metabolites, and the sum of extractable or 
non-extractable radioactivity in the monkey and in the rat. This is when using the data as calculated by 
the applicant, which seems to include an error that leads to an overestimation of the human exposure. 
The consequence is that the true qualification ratios may be higher, which has no impact on the fact 
that the diverse metabolite fractions are considered qualified.   
Taking into account the linearity of plasma protein binding and the lack of active transport, it can be 
assumed that the total plasma concentration of pretomanid represents a reasonable surrogate for 
unbound plasma and lung concentration. 
The chemical structure of pretomanid has one chiral centre but the applied product is the S-enantiomer 
of the racemate. The applicant provided convincing non-clinical data and in vitro data from human 
hepatocytes where the other enantiomer (PA-1147) was not detected. It is endorsed that there is no 
evidence of chiral inversion at this point.  
The total recovery of radioactivity was 90% following oral single doses of 14C-labelled-pretomanid with 
ca 70-75% of the dose was excreted within the first four days after administration and in total about 
90% during the 11-days sampling collection. About 60% of the dose was excreted in the urine and ca 
30% in faeces. 
About 60% of the elimination pathways have been characterized, according to the EMA guideline 80% 
of the excreted radioactivity should be characterized ie ca 70%. Less than 1% was excreted unchanged 
compound in the urine and <2% in faeces. Depending on the radioactive labelling, [benzyl-14C]- or 
[imidazooxazinele-14C]-pretomanid, some differences in the metabolic pathways were characterized. 
However, independently of labelling many radioactive peaks were detected. M11 (M19-glycine 
conjugate) was the largest metabolite, with 13% of dose excreted in the urine. The second largest 
metabolite in the urine was M26 (7% of the dose). Several metabolites were excreted in the urine and 
faces with each representing <5% and <3% of the dose, respectively.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 48/121 
 
  
 
 
The reactions involved in the elimination pathways of pretomanid and its metabolites are oxidations, 
including oxidative dealkylation and oxidative deamination; nitro-reduction; and conjugations, 
including glycine, glucuronide, and glutathione. In vitro metabolism data showed that pretomanid was 
relatively stable but CYP3A4 seemed to be involved. In the in vivo DDI study (A5306) where 
pretomanid was co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir (ritonavir - known CYP3A4 inhibitor) was a 
small decrease in exposure of pretomanid seen, with plasma levels of ca 0.85-fold compared when 
dosed alone. Thus, it can be concluded that CYP3A4 is partly involved in the metabolism of pretomanid 
in vivo. The co-administration of pretomanid with efavirenz (known CYP3A4 inducer) or rifampicin 
(known CYP inducer) resulted in a slight decrease in exposure of pretomanid with levels of 0.65- and 
0.35-fold compared when dosed alone. The impact of genetic polymorphisms has been evaluated on 
the premises: 
•  Genes relevant to elimination of pretomanid and its metabolites vary from having little 
polymorphism (e.g., glycine N-acyltransferase) to substantial polymorphism (e.g. CYP3A4). 
•  Nothing specific is known about the impact of any polymorphism on pretomanid or its 
metabolites. 
•  However, polymorphisms are not expected to be clinically relevant: 
o  The multiplicity of metabolic pathways reduces sensitivity to changes in any particular 
pathway.  If genetic polymorphisms were important for the elimination of pretomanid 
itself, one consequence might be a large variability in pretomanid exposure. 
The literature review conducted by the applicant (D151 response) supports that major genetic sources 
of variability is not expected, but overall there is uncertainty left on sources of variability in pretomanid 
PK and their relative impact.  
The risk of pretomanid to interact with other active compounds, both from victim and perpetrator 
horizon, and potentially result in changes clinical efficacy/safety needs to be further investigated, in 
particular the potential impact of TDI of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Depending on emerging in vitro results 
further in vivo studies may be needed. The applicant agreed to perform the in vitro studies and 
adapted the SmPC accordingly.  
Pretomanid is an inhibitor of the OAT3 transporter in vitro, which could result in increased 
concentrations of OAT3 substrate drugs clinically and may increase the risk of adverse reactions of 
these drugs. This has been described in the SmPC (section 4.5). An in vivo study is not planned. 
Pretomanid enters MTB and is there converted to desnitro pretomanid. As part of the D151 response, 
the applicant has provided a literature review and a discussion of the potential impact of bacteria on 
the PK of pretomanid. Bioreduction of pretomanid’s aromatic nitro group is part of the activation of 
pretomanid within the target MTB. However, limited data has been presented to understand the 
bacterial contribution to the metabolism of pretomanid. While no significant difference is observed in 
healthy volunteers versus patients, indicating that the MTB burden does not impact the overall 
elimination of pretomanid, pre-systemic metabolism by intestinal microflora is likely to occur, but the 
extent has not been investigated. In principle, in vitro studies and/or a mechanistic model could be 
have been used to explore this. Parallel to the requirements for in vitro incubations with CYP enzymes 
and transporters to understand the potential need for further in vivo investigation of involved ADME 
pathways and consequent potential impact on DDIs or genetic polymorphisms, in vitro incubations to 
investigate bacterial metabolism and potential release of pretomanid and metabolites from the bacteria 
could have been performed. Such exploratory investigations are not requested at this stage and as it is 
considered that the metabolic pathways of pretomanid have not been thoroughly investigated, these 
uncertainties are suggested described in the SmPC, and EPAR. 
EMA/200048/2020

As pretomanid seems to be mainly eliminated by metabolism, the clinical consequences of potential 
increase in systemic exposure of pretomanid due to decreased hepatic function needs to be 
understood. No PK of pretomanid in subjects diagnosed with different degrees of hepatic impairment 
have been presented. A study in hepatic impairment is ongoing and expected to be reported mid 2021. 
Less than 1% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. A lack of a PK study in RI is acceptable 
for a drug that is predominantly hepatically eliminated and for which safety data are available 
indicating that dose adjustments are not necessary even at a markedly increased exposure to the 
drug. Such safety data are currently not available for pretomanid. A study in subjects with decreased 
renal function with a reduced/staged design is ongoing. While awaiting these results and derived 
treatment recommendations, there should be a restriction in the use of pretomanid in patients with 
reduced renal function. In the provided link to the renal impairment study details at clinicaltrials.gov, it 
is noted that pretomanid will be administered as a single 200 mg dose in the fasting condition. In such 
situations with dose-dependent, food-dependent and potentially time-dependent pharmacokinetics, 
steady state pharmacokinetics of pretomanid may not be readily predicted by single dose fasting data. 
It is questioned whether it will be possible to draw conclusions regarding dosing recommendations in 
renally impaired subjects based on this study.  
The presented popPK model has several shortcomings, including strong signals of over-
parameterisation and several covariates without a biological basis, while the final model appears to 
describe the data set well. The current popPK model can be considered exploratory only and is not 
considered qualified for extrapolation purposes. The predictability into future data is not expected to be 
adequate, which was also demonstrated by the model without the Nix-TB data not being able to predict 
the Nix-TB data adequately. A credible popPK model is necessary to improve the current understanding 
of sources of variability and increase confidence regarding posology recommendations in sub-
populations. Pretomanid will be further developed for a paediatric indication. The key binding elements 
of the EMA opinion (EMA/PDCO/777955/2018 Corr) on the Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-
002115-PIP01-17) specify that a popPK model should be developed based on the adult data, scaled to 
the paediatric population and used for planning the paediatric studies. The specified objective of the 
model is to inform the dose finding in paediatric patients as well as determining the PK sampling 
scheme. It is important to note that the current model is not qualified for this purpose. The Applicant 
has agreed to refine the current popPK model before paediatric development.   
Models describing increasing EBACFU(0-14), EBATTP(0-14) and time to sputum culture conversion (TSCC) as 
a function of average concentration (Cavg) were presented in the MAA. However, these models were not 
considered credible due to very limited data in the lower exposure region to support the functional 
shape estimated, no pre-specification of data handling and model discrimination and no model 
evaluation. The current exposure-response models cannot be used to derive a lower target 
concentration threshold for pretomanid where adequate efficacy is expected to be achieved or as an 
evidence of the contribution of pretomanid to the overall treatment effect. 
The QTc-concentration model for the combined effects of bedaquiline-M2 and pretomanid is currently 
not considered qualified to predict QTc effects at supra-therapeutic exposure due to lack of relevant 
data. Current uncertainties regarding QTc prolongation risk for the bedaquiline+pretomanid 
combination are unresolved and will remain as part of the benefit-risk evaluation. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pretomanid has activity to MTB, with MIC values in the range of of ≤0.015 to 2 mg/L, where MICs are 
fully similar in DS-, MDR- and XDR TB strains. Values seem method dependent (MICs on solid agar < 
REMA < MGIT, with an up to 4-fold difference for MGIT vs agar. The evaluation of breakpoints 
(seemingly method dependent) is a future matter for the TB team of the EU-CAST committee.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 50/121 
 
  
 
 
In addition to MTB, some other mycobacterial species (M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. pinnipedi) were 
susceptible, while other strains are fully resistant (M. avium, M. phlei, M. smegmatis, M. fortuitum or 
M. kansasii as well as M. Leprae). 
In resistant MTB strains, 80% of resistant cases were explained by point mutations in 5 genes 
encoding for 3 enzymes involved in the activation of pretomanid in 80% of cases; i.e. some unknown 
mechanisms of resistance still remain to be found.  There seems to be no relevant cross resistance to 
other TB agents, with the exception for delamanid, which is activated by the same enzymes and where 
cross resistance was anticipated. 
The activity of pretomanid in monotherapy as well as in various combinations with other TB agents has 
been studied in large numbers of pre-clinical studies, mainly in mice. The results in these studies 
support the dose of pretomanid as well as the contribution of each agent to the present regimen. 
When looking at baseline pretomanid MIC values in the clinical program, pre-existing resistance has so 
far only been seen in a couple of cases (indicating a prevalence of <1%). To date, no cases of 
treatment-emergent pretomanid resistance has been seen, neither in the NC-006 study (mainly 
concerning DS-TB patients) nor in the Nix-TB study.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A rather limited clinical pharmacology package has been provided in the pretomanid submission. 
Further basic data considering elimination and potential DDIs are needed to secure efficacious and safe 
use pretomanid in all patients independently of co-treatments, organ function and will be provided as a 
follow-up measure (REC):  
1.  Renal impairment study  
2.  Hepatic impairment study 
3.  In vitro data shows signs of both PXR-mediated induction and time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8 
and CYP2C19 caused by pretomanid. In vivo data on the effect of pretomanid on midazolam cannot 
be used to exclude the risk for CYP2C induction in vivo, as pretomanid is also a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Thus, a clinically relevant effect of pretomanid on CYP2C substrates (induction and/or inhibition) 
cannot be excluded based on available data. The Applicant is recommended to provide further 
data. The risk for induction may be further addressed in vitro, by providing data on the effect of 
pretomanid on the PXR co-regulated enzymes CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2C8 in hepatocytes. In case of 
positive signal in vitro, a multiple-dose DDI study with a sensitive CYP2C substrate would be 
recommended 
4.  In vitro inhibition of Pgp, OATP1B3, OCT2 and BCRP by Pretomanid 
In addition, Pretomanid will be further developed for a paediatric indication. The key binding elements 
of the EMA opinion (EMA/PDCO/777955/2018 Corr) on the Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-
002115-PIP01-17) specify that a popPK model will be developed based on the adult data, scaled to the 
paediatric population and used for planning the paediatric studies.  The specified objective of the model 
is to inform the dose finding of pretomanid in paediatric patients as well as determining the PK 
sampling scheme of the two planned studies. A credible adult model is a necessary step for proceeding 
to a scaled paediatric model and to obtain reliable predictions of the doses in the paediatric population. 
The plan included involvement of dedicated expert following pharmacometricians and external 
validation/refinement of the popPK model as more data become available, including the key activities: 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 51/121 
 
  
 
 
- The popPK model will be updated/refined with paediatric data from PIP Study 3 in July 2020 and 
used to inform the dose and PK sampling strategy for PIP Study 4 (PAEDIATRIC-1, final protocol 
August 2020).  
- The popPK model will be refined with data from ZeNix, SimplicitiTB and interim data from 
PAEDIATRIC-1 prior between June 2021 and February 2022 and used to inform the dose and PK 
sampling strategy for PIP Study 5 (PAEDIATRIC-2, final protocol January 2023 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pretomanid shows potent effect against MTB in vitro, where MIC values are similar in the presence of 
resistance to other approved agents in other classes.  
Pre-clinical in vivo efficacy has been shown in a large number of murine models, both in monotherapy 
and in various combinations with other agents. For the present application, experiments performed in 
the mouse model at the Johns Hopkins University (2015) convincingly show that each of the agents in 
the B-Pa-L regimen (the regimen used in the pivotal study, Nix-TB) add to the activity of this triple 
regimen. 
On basis of available data of limited size, baseline resistance to pretomanid is presently very 
uncommon (around 1%). In the clinical studies no cases of pretomanid resistance development has 
been documented so far. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The pretomanid clinical program (kinetic studies excluded) is outlined in the next table. All studies 
concern pulmonary TB. 
EBA studies included Pa monotherapy in doses 50 –1200 mg qd, and Pa dosed 100 (1 study) or 200 
mg per day in various combinations with bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide and clofazimine. 
In efficacy studies in DS TB patients, Pa (dosed 100 or 200 mg) has been explored as regimens Pa/B/Z 
and Pa/M/Z in phase 2. The Pa/M/Z regimen (Pa dosed 100 or 200 mg) was also evaluated in a phase 
3 study, a study that failed; study NC- 006 (“STAND”) was halted by the FDA for safety reasons and 
when this halt was lifted recruitment was not re—started. The sample size was therefore much lower 
than planned, and non-inferiority versus standard of care was not achieved (point estimate favouring 
the control regimen).  Instead another study was started (NC-008, “SimpliciTB “, ongoing) evaluating 
regimen BPaMZ for 4 months versus SOC (HRZE/HR for 6 months). 
In MDR-TB patients the regimen Pa/B/M/Z has been explored in phase 2 (8 weeks efficacy) and is 
being explored in one arm of the NC-008 study (treatment duration 26 weeks for the MDR-TB 
patients). A very limited number of MDR-TB patients were also part of the NC006 study (Pa/M/Z for 26 
weeks, too few patients to evaluate). 
In XDR-TB patients or MDR-TB where patients do not tolerate or respond to their regimen, the NIX-TB 
study (pivotal study of the present application) and the ZeNix study (ongoing) both evaluate Pa in 
combination with bedaquiline and Linezolid (B/Pa/L). Linezolid has an unfavourable toxicity profile, and 
the Zenix study explores outcomes for 4 different linezolid dosing schedules. In the NIX-TB study 
Linezolid is given at high dose throughout 26 weeks of therapy. 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 52/121 
 
  
 
 
 
To be noted, the bedaquiline dosing differs in these studies. According to the present EU label 
(Sirturo), bedaquiline is dosed 400 mg qd during the first 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg thrice weekly. 
In addition to that dosing, 200 mg daily (26 weeks) and 200 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by 100 mg 
for the remaining 16 weeks, is evaluated. The latter dose has been chosen for the two larger ongoing 
studies ZeNix and SimpliciTB.

The main inclusion criterion for the phase 2 studies was a new diagnosis of pulmonary TB, confirmed 
by a positive test for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in a sputum smear direct microscopy test. In studies 
involving DS-TB patients, the key exclusion criterion was the presence of rifampicin- and/or isoniazid-
resistant bacteria in the pre-treatment sputum sample; conversely, in studies involving MDR-TB 
patients, rifampicin-resistance was a key inclusion criterion, and fluoroquinolone-resistance a key 
exclusion criterion. Thus, at Screening, spot sputum samples were subjected to the following tests: 
• Direct AFB microscopy 
• Rapid test for rifampicin and isoniazid (and for fluoroquinolones if the trial required it) 
• Identification/speciation of the infecting organism by rapid test  
Rapid tests for detection of resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid or fluoroquinolones (and for MTBC 
bacteria) included Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF, and line probe assays Hain GenoType MTBDRplus and 
GenoType MTBDRsl. Cultures of screening samples were also subjected to rapid tests for 
identification/speciation. These included a non-commercial PCR-based test (Warren et al., 2006) or a 
commercial immunochromatographic assay based on detection of antigen MPT64 (e.g., Becton 
Dickinson TBc ID). 
In EBA studies and in 8 week-studies, primary outcomes were based on sputum sample cultures on 
solid media and/or in liquid media. Pooled overnight (over approximately 16 hours) sputum samples 
collected at various time points during the trial, were digested and divided into 2 fractions; one was 
serially diluted and inoculated onto Middlebrook 7H11S medium for quantitative sputum culture (CFU 
counts per mL of sputum, mean of 4 counts), and the other was decontaminated and cultured in the 
MGIT system to determine time-to-positivity (TTP; in hours). 
Phase 3 - Nix-TB (pivotal for this application) 
Subjects were included in the trial as either having XDR-TB or TI/NR MDR-TB based on documented 
resistance to a panel of anti-TB drugs at any time prior to enrollment. In addition, a culture positive for 
MTB within 3 months prior to screening or MTB confirmed in sputum based on a molecular test within 3 
months prior to or at screening could be used to confirm a pulmonary TB diagnosis. These “historical 
data”, obtained at non-study laboratories, were collected for all subjects. Historical drug 
susceptibility information took precedence for inclusion over any results from the Screening 
molecular tests.  
At Screening, a coached spot sputum sample was subjected to: 
• AFB microscopy 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 54/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
• A molecular test to identify MTB and detect resistance to rifampicin (line probe assay Hain 
GenoType MTBDRplus or Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF) 
• Culture in the MGIT system followed by a rapid identification or speciation test to detect MTB and 
determine TTP. 
Metrics of Efficacy 
CFU Counts and Time to Positivity (TTP) 
Two measurements of the mycobactericidal activity of a drug or a drug regimen have been used 
commonly to characterize efficacy in phase 2 studies, using cultures derived from sampled sputum: 1) 
the number of CFUs counted on solid media and 2) the time to culture positivity (TTP) in liquid media 
(MGIT system).  These two effects are measured longitudinally for each patient. 
CFU counts are related to the number of live bacteria in the sputum sample and hence in the infected 
lungs.  Killing of bacteria by antibiotics commonly results in exponential or biphasic exponential decline 
in bacteria populations over the first several weeks of treatment.  Thus, a plot of the serial 
measurements of a patient’s CFUs, transformed to log10 (CFU) versus time, may appear to decrease in 
a linear or piecewise linear manner. 
TTP represents the time until the cultured population of TB organisms from the sputum sample grows 
to a sufficient size to trigger a positive signal from the MGIT device.  TTP is inversely related to the 
number of live bacteria in the sputum sample and hence in the infected lung.  Profiles of TTP or 
log10(TTP) versus time have also been described by linear or piecewise linear relationships, although 
for TTP, a positive slope is associated with a declining bacteria population.  
CFU counts and TTP were then used to calculate the following parameters: 
• 
• 
EBACFU: the rate of change of log10CFU in sputum over time, characterized by linear or non-
linear regression of log10CFU over time 
EBATTP: the rate of change in TTP (or log10TTP) in the MGIT system during treatment over time 
•  BACFU: the rate of change of log10CFU in sputum over 56 days of treatment, determined from 
the model-fitted log10CFU results as calculated by the regression of the observed log10CFU 
over time 
•  BATTP: the rate of change in TTP in the MGIT system over 56 days of treatment, determined 
from the model-fitted log10TTP as calculated by the regression of the observed log10TTP over 
time 
Sputum Culture Conversion 
Sputum is said to have been converted to negative if culturing in solid media yields no colony growth, 
and similarly if culturing in liquid media (MGIT) yields no signal of positivity, by 42 days after initiation 
of the culture.

Early Morning and Coached Spot sputum collections, both samples analysed. A positive 
culture takes precedence over a negative culture at the same visit. Culture conversion 
required negative results at 2 consecutive visits at least 7 days apart. Subjects who were 
unable to produce sputum but who were clinically responding well were considered culture

In the phase 3 studies, sputum culture conversion at 6 months post end of treatment is primary 
endpoint of success.  The time point is justified by an analysis of 15 TB treatment trials showing that 
78% of all relapses occurred within 6 months of stopping treatment and 91% occurred within 12 
months (Nunn 2010). 
Drug susceptibility testing 
Phase 2 studies 
Susceptibility testing was performed on MTB isolated from participants prior to treatment start 
(baseline) and, in some studies, also at end of treatment, as follows: 
•  Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol in the 
MGIT system, using the standard critical concentrations recommended by the manufacturer 
•  MGIT DST and/or DNA sequencing analysis of pncA gene (Whitfield et al., 2015) for detection 
of pyrazinamide resistance in trials involving the drug. 
•  MIC testing for the study drugs. 
MIC testing for pretomanid was performed using a modified agar proportion method in all studies, 
except for NC-003 where REMA was used.  
Phase 3 studies 
MIC testing (study regimens) 
In the phase 3 trials, the REMA (NC-006) and MGIT (Nix-TB) methods were used for determining MIC 
values for pretomanid and the other drugs studied. The decision to use broth-based methods in these 
studies was made based on the potential large numbers of MTB clinical isolates to be tested, requiring 
simpler, high-throughput methods. In addition, in the case of Nix-TB, as all isolates were expected to 
be extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-MTB or MDR-TB). The issue of biosafety was 
therefore deemed important, where the MGIT system is considered to be the safest assay for staff to 
handle.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 56/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recently, a direct comparison of the MGIT, REMA and agar proportion methods was performed using 
pretomanid-susceptible and pretomanid-resistant laboratory strains, as well as clinical isolates. This 
comparison revealed a trend towards slightly higher MIC values by MGIT, followed by the REMA and 
agar proportion methods. 
Details on baseline MIC determinations are discussed in the pharmacodynamics section.   
Baseline Susceptibility to Other Anti-TB Drugs 
Data on susceptibility to anti-TB drugs other than the study drugs included information obtained prior 
to subject enrollment (historical data) and information gathered at screening using molecular tests, or 
at baseline during the trial using the MGIT. Phenotypic DST in liquid media or on solid media were 
acceptable for historical data.  Because these two data sets were generated at different laboratories 
using different methodology and at different timepoints in subjects’ TB history, discrepancies were 
expected.  When they occurred, historical data took precedence.  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
EBA studies (14 days duration) 
Study CL-007 [August-Dec 2007, South Africa]  
The study explored Pa dosed 200, 600, 1000, and 1200 mg (all qd, fasting). EBA outcomes (log10 CFU-
reduction and mean TTP) were fully similar for the 4 doses of Pa (around 1.5 log10 reduction in CFU 
counts), and the effect of control similar in magnitude to that reported previously for the HRZE (around 
2.0 log10-reduction). 
Hence, this study tried doses that were above the efficacy maximum of Pa. A second EBA study was 
therefore initiated, see below. 
Study CL-010 [August 2009-May 2010]  
The study tested Pa in doses 50,100,150 and 200 mg, all qd and fasting. Again, EBA outcomes did not 
differ significantly from each other, but there was a trend toward significance, indicating that the 50 
mg dose may have lower EBA than the higher doses taken together, see table below and figure next 
page. The EBAs yielded with the 200 mg dose in studies C-007 and C-010 were very similar.

The study was partially blinded and the microbiological assessments were fully blinded. Outcomes are 
shown below. The study was not powered to test for statistical differences between the treatment 
groups with respect to the primary efficacy variable, and results are exploratory.  
In summary, Pa-M-Z showed a higher activity than HRZE control. The Pa-M-Z regimen was 
subsequently tested for 8 weeks in study NC-002, and further on for 16 or 24 weeks in the NC-006 
study.

higher dose of Pa. The EBA outcomes in this study are similar to those seen in NC-001, although in this 
case there is no clear advantage with the 200 mg dose over the 100 mg dose. However, the 8 week 
outcomes is in favour of the higher dose (see section on 8 weeks efficacy).

This was a 6-armed study, evaluating several regimens, table below. Only DS-TB patients were 
included.  
Pa, B and Z was dosed as in study NC-001 ; clofazimine (C) was dosed 300 mg days 1-3, 100 mg days 
4-14. 
The change in CFU counts over time was the highest for the B-Pa-Z regimen. If allowing for a cross 
study comparison, the 14 day bactericidal activity of B-Pa-Z is somewhat lower than with Pa-M-Z (NC-
001) or quite similar to this regimen (NC-002, EBA substudy).  
- These two regimens were evaluated for 8 weeks (Pa-M-Z in NC-002, and B-Pa-Z in NC-005).

In this study it is noted that pyrazinamide (Z) in practice lack activity in short term therapy. The use of 
this agent has been a means to shorten relapse free standard treatment in DS-TB patients from 9 
months to 6 months, when used as part of this regimen (HRZE) for the first 2 months. 
It is also noted that clofazimine in monotherapy did not show any significant EBA, and did not seem to 
add to the activity of other regimens tested. This issue was evaluated in pre-clinical studies by 
Ammerman et al (JAC 2016). They explored the activity of clofazimine in a number of studies (activity 
in vitro and pre-clinical models mimicking EBA-studies), where it was shown that the response to 
clofazimine was quite delayed, and only seen with higher doses. On the basis of clinical studies in 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 59/121 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MDR-TB patients, there is some evidence that the addition of clofazimine is a means of shortening TB 
therapy, and the agent is presently listed as a preferred agent for the treatment of MDR-TB by the 
WHO. Clofazimine is not part of regimens further evaluated by the applicant. 
No EBA comparison has been made to delamanid, an agent of the same class, and no data on 
delamanid was summarized in the application. However, EBA studies of delamanid and (now) 
pretomanid (CL-010) have been assessed by the Agency, and results have also been published (both by 
Diacon et al, in 2011). Both studies were done in South Africa, had the same principal investigator and 
samples were analysed at the department of Biomedical Sciences at Stellenbosch University, using 
identical procedures. In CL-010 (Pa EBA) the 3 higher doses (100-150-200 mg qd) yielded around 1.5 log10 
reductions in CFU counts/ml sputum (vs -2log10 with HRZE control). Delamanid in doses 100-400 mg qd, 
yielded around 0.5 log10 reductions, without a statistical difference between doses, and the activity with 
HRZE control was similar to that seen in CL-010, tables next page. Hence, the EBA activity of pretomanid 
is likely substantially higher than for delamanid, even though this was not compared within one study.

8 weeks efficacy of PA in combination with other agents  
In these studies change in CFU counts and TTP (days 0-56) are still the primary endpoints. Sputum 
culture conversion at week 8 is a secondary endpoint. Following the 8 weeks test period, patients 
received treatment according to local standard of care. 
Study NC-002 [March 2012-July 2013 in South Africa, Tanzania and Brazil] evaluated the regimens 
below. In addition to DS TB patients (randomized), a small group of MDR TB patients were included, 
allocated to therapy with Pa 200 mg + M + Z. 
In this study Pa dosed 200 mg + M + Z had a significantly higher bactericidal activity (over 8 weeks) 
than the HRZE control regimen (not significance for the 100 mg dose regimen).

In liquid media (MGIT) the proportion of patients who were sputum culture negative at week 8 
(secondary endpoint) was significantly higher with the Pa + M + Z regimens (both doses) than with 
control (not significance with the use of solid media). Similar results were seen in MDR-TB patients 
(low numbers, descriptive data).

different dosing schedules, plus pyrazinamide, versus HRZE control. A 4th arm included MDR TB 
patients, allocated to Pa + bedaquiline (dosed 200 mg daily) + moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide. Around 
15% of DS TB patients were HIV-positive; in the MDR TB arm this figure was 42%.

The differences between test regimens versus HRZE (control regimen) for the primary end point, TTP 
in liquid media in overnight samples, were statistically significant, see table below. Differences for this 
end point between test regimens were not significant. This analysis is based on the mITT population 
(211/240 randomized patients), where cases of pyrazinamide resistance was excluded; 29 patients 
were excluded due to resistance to pyrazinamide at/prior to baseline, 7/180 (4%), of randomized DS-
TB patients and 22/60 (37%) of randomized MDR-TB patients.

In summary, in cross study comparison, 8 weeks results in NC-002 and NC-005 seemed rather similar 
with the Pa-B-Z regimen, and the Pa-M-Z regimen. In the 2 weeks EBA studies the Pa-M-Z regimen 
perhaps yielded a somewhat more rapid response (NC 001 vs NC 003). The Pa-M-Z regimen was 
chosen for a phase 3 study of full treatment duration in DS TB patients (NC-006, STAND), where the 
main objective was to evaluate whether that regimen given for 4 months is non-inferior to standard of 
care. This study, which failed, is discussed in the section Supportive studies.

Conclusions on EBA results: 
•  A noticeable EBA was measured during monotherapy with pretomanid at all doses.  
•  Dose range-finding studies supported a clinical dose of 200 mg of pretomanid per day 
• 
• 
• 
The combinations containing pretomanid that showed the greatest early (over 14 days) 
bactericidal activity were PaMZ in NC-001 and BPaZ in NC-003 
The PaMZ and BPaZ combinations appeared more efficacious than the standard HRZE therapy for 
the treatment of DS-TB in 8-week trials 
The BPaMZ combination used to treat MDR-TB patients showed the highest BACFU(0-56) and 
BATTP(0-56) observed in 8-week trials 
•  No evidence was found of pretomanid resistance among baseline isolates and no emergence of 
pretomanid resistance was observed during treatment 
Linezolid dose choice for Main study 
Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial drug approved for the treatment of drug-resistant, gram-
positive bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and enterococci. Linezolid 
is not formally approved for the treatment of TB infection but has been part of treatment for patients 
with advanced resistance (pre-XDR/XDR-TB) for quite some time, and a recommended agent by the 
WHO as part of such therapy. 
Linezolid is active against MTB in vitro, including against MDR strains, with MICs ranging from 0.125-1 
μg/mL (Tato et al, 2006). In the lack of data to indicate what dose of linezolid that is optimal to 
effectively treat TB infection, the TB Alliance has completed an EBA study, LIN-CL-001. This study 
(performed Nov 2014 – Nov 2016) explored linezolid dosed 300 mg qd/bid, 600 mg qd/bid and 1200 
mg qd and thrice weekly in patients with newly diagnosed DS-TB. HRZE served as control. Change in 
CFU counts and TTP (both as model-fitted log CFU counts/TTP) over time were primary end points, in 
line with the other EBA studies presented. 
A dose response was seen up to 1200 mg daily dosing, without a significant difference when comparing 
bid and qd dosing, see table below.

When looking at pharmacokinetics, Linezolid administered 1200 mg QD as well as 300 and 600 mg BID 
yielded values above MIC throughout the dosing interval in all participants. This was not achieved with 
the 300 mg qd and 600 mg qd dosing. It was concluded that linezolid has a concentration-dependent

bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The dose chosen for the main study was 600 
mg bid (changed to 1200 mg qd following an amendment). 
Main study 
Nix-TB: A Phase 3 Open-label Trial Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Bedaquiline Plus Pretomanid 
Plus Linezolid (B-Pa-L) in Subjects with Pulmonary Infection of Either Extensively Drug-resistant 
Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) or Treatment Intolerant/Non-responsive Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis 
(MDR-TB). 
First Patient Enrolled:    
16 April 2015 
Date of data cut-off for efficacy presented in this report:  
29 March 2019 
Expected Last Patient’s Last Visit:  
13 July 2020 
Centres: 3 sites in South Africa (Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg)  
Methods 
During the procedure efficacy for all 109 patients up to the time for the primary endpoint (6 months of 
follow-up post EOT) was provided. 
Study Participants  
Main entry criteria  
Patients with min weight of at least 35 kg, and age ≥ 14 years with pulmonary XDR-TB, or with MDR-
TB and not responding to (6 months record)/tolerating the MDR-TB regimen.  
A positive culture (fulfilling XDR-TB, or MDR-TB criteria) within 3 months prior to screening was 
requested, as well as an X-ray picture (within a year prior to Screening) consistent with pulmonary TB. 
Patients may have previously been treated for DS/MDR-TB. No prior treatment with pretomanid was 
allowed, and a maximum of 14 days prior therapy with bedaquiline and/or linezolid, provided that this 
treatment was discontinued at least 3 days prior to the first trial treatment administration. 
Patients co-infected with HIV needed to have a CD4 count of at least 50 cells/uL; for those on HIV 
therapy, efavirenz (strong inducer) was not allowed. Any NRTIs could be used.  
Note: a weight of at least 35 kg and having strong inducer/inhibitors as part of exclusion criteria was 
implemented as part of amendment 2, when 44 patients already had been included.   
Treatments 
Patients received orally administered trial treatment as follows: 
Bedaquiline according to label + Pretomanid 200 mg QD + Linezolid 1200 mg daily for 24 weeks, if 
culture positive or reverted to being culture positive Months 4-6 and clinical condition suggestive of 
ongoing TB infection, treatment could be extended to 9 months.  (Note: For the present interim 
efficacy analysis (N=81) only 1 patient was given prolonged treatment of 39 weeks). 
The initial 44 patients were dosed linezolid 600 mg BID. After this Amendment 2 was in place, and the 
dosing was changed to 1200 mg QD.  
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 64/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment was to be taken with food (within 30 min before or after meal) 
Toxicity and dose adjustments 
Reduction in linezolid dose, including temporary cessation up to 35 days, was allowed in case of 
linezolid-specific toxicity.  A step down in dose was to proceed from 1200 mg QD to 600 mg QD and 
then to 300 mg QD. While linezolid was withheld, patients could remain on bedaquiline and 
pretomanid, provided that they had received linezolid 1200 mg for at least the first 4 weeks and were 
smear-negative/had trace results. 
If drug-related toxicity caused by bedaquiline and/or pretomanid was suspected, the full treatment 
regimen may have been halted for up to 35 consecutive days. It was not allowed to halt just 
bedaquiline and pretomanid and continue linezolid as monotherapy. 
Objectives 
The objective of the NIX-TB study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety and pharmacokinetics of 
pretomanid + bedaquiline + linezolid given for 6(-9) months for the treatment of XDR-TB (or MDR-TB 
in those intolerant to the recommended MDR-TB regimen), and to show a cure rate of at least 50%. 
The reasons for not including a control regimen, and the 50% cure rate as a minimum target was 
discussed by the applicant, and this is reflected in the end of the efficacy section. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary end-point: incidence of clinical failure, bacteriologic relapse, or bacteriologic failure (re-
infection) through 6 months after the end of treatment. 
Secondary endpoints:  
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of bacteriologic failure, or relapse, or clinical failure through follow-up until 
24 months after the end of treatment 
Time to sputum culture conversion 
Proportion with sputum culture conversion at 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 26 or 39 weeks; 
•  Exploring Linezolid dosing (actual) and efficacy 
•  Change from baseline TB symptoms on the basis of a 10 symptom questionnaire 
•  Change from baseline in the patient-reported health status. 
•  Change from baseline weight. 
Sample size 
The study was originally planned as an exploratory study without formal statistical testing and a 
sample size calculation was therefore not performed.  
The study was originally planned to enrol a total of up to 200 patients. However, 109 patients were 
enrolled in the trial (recruitment completion on 15 November 2017), and another study, the ZeNix 
study, exploring the BPaL regimen with 4 different dosing regimens of linezolid, was initiated rather 
than increasing the size of the Nix-TB study.

Statistical methods  
Analysis populations 
• 
• 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population was defined as all patients, excluding late 
Screening failures. For the ITT population patients who were not proven to have a favourable 
outcome were classified as having an unfavourable outcome. 
The Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis population is defined as the ITT analysis 
population with extra exclusions: 
o  Patients who completed treatment, were lost to follow-up or withdrawn from the trial, 
their last status being culture negative and their last positive culture result followed by 
at least 2 negative culture results 
o  Women who became pregnant during treatment and stopped their trial treatment 
o  Patients who died during treatment from violent or accidental cause (not including 
suicide) 
o  Patients who died during follow-up with no evidence of failure or relapse of their TB 
o  Patients re-infected with a new strain after being classified as having culture negative 
status  
o  Patients with only contaminated or missing sputum samples for primary endpoint visit, 
provided patient had not already been classified as unfavourable, and provided their 
last positive culture was followed by at least 2 negative cultures.  
• 
The Per-protocol (PP) analysis population is defined as the MITT population with extra 
exclusions. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment failure, defined as bacteriologic failure or relapse or 
clinical failure through follow-up until 6 months after the End of Treatment. The probability of 
treatment failure through follow-up until 6 months after the End of Treatment, as a function of time 
after assignment of treatment, was analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The binomial proportion for 
patients with bacteriologic failure was presented.  
The proportion of assessable patients with a favourable and unfavourable outcome, with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), was presented. For success, the lower bound of the 95% CI for a favourable 
outcome had to be >50%.  
Adjustment for covariates was not performed. Due to small numbers, no subgroup analyses were 
conducted and no multiplicity adjustments for alpha were done. The latter was motivated by the study 
being (initially) exploratory. 
Sensitivity analyses  
The following sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed: 
•  Analyses of the ITT analysis population, MITT analysis population, and PP analysis population 
including only the XDR-TB patients. 
•  Analyses of the ITT analysis population, MITT analysis population, and PP analysis population 
excluding patients who were never culture positive during the baseline period.

Missing data 
Patients who dropped out of the trial were included in the analyses. For the ITT population patients 
who were not proven to have a favourable outcome were classified as having an unfavourable 
outcome. 
Interim analyses 
No formal interim analysis for efficacy was planned. However, interim analyses were performed once 
the first 15, 30, and 45 patients completed the 6-month follow-up after completion of the Treatment 
Period, withdrew from the trial, were lost to follow-up, or died.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study  
There were 4 amendments with a number of details. The first was in place prior to the inclusion of the 
first patient. Amendment 2 (22 January 2016, and already mentioned) is considered of highest 
interest, where linezolid dosing was changed from 600 mg BID to 1200 mg QD based on preliminary 
data from a linezolid clinical trial that noted similar bactericidal effect on TB when either dosing scheme 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 67/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
was given for 14 days (discussed previously). This amendment also added exclusion of patients who 
had received more than 2 weeks of bedaquiline or linezolid and added cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors 
and inducers to specific treatment exclusion.  
Baseline data  
Age ranged from 17 years to 60 years (mean 35.6 years) and the weight from 29 to 112 kg (mean 
57). The gender mix was even (48% females). Most patients were black (83/109) or of mixed race 
(n=25). 
Just over half were HIV-positive (56/109). The mean CD4 count (available for 51/56) was around 400 
cells μL (range 55-1023). Viral loads were not provided.   
TB disease characteristics 
Abnormal chest X-ray results compatible with TB were reported for all 109 patients. Around 50% had 
unilateral cavities, followed by bilateral cavities (41, 38%).  Seventeen (16%) patients had no cavities. 
The chest X-ray and cavity type results were similar by linezolid dosing group (background mentioned 
previously). The majority of patients had a previous MDR diagnosis as the original type of TB and 
entered this study with XDR TB.

The proportion of HIV co-infected was very high, around 50% At baseline, the majority of these 
patients were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy (25/56) or nevirapine-based therapy 
(17/56); efavirenz based therapy was not allowed (interaction). Eight were untreated fir the HIV-
infection. Lopinavir/ritonavir causes an around 2-fold increase of bedaquiline exposure (M2-metabolite 
not affected) (Brill et al 2017), and also pretomanid exposure is likely increased (CYP inhibition).

Outcomes and estimation  
Primary endpoint (MITT) 
A favourable outcome was seen in 98/107 patients (92%), and similar for those with XDR and MDR-
TB, next table. Hence, the favourable outcome rate is well in line with the outcomes achieved in DS-TB 
patients treated with standard of care.  
Table 23. Outcome ,mITT population, and reasons for unfavorabe outcome  (23 March 2019) 
Abbreviations: MDR, multidrug-resistant; MITT, modified intent-to-treat; N, number of patients; NR, 
nonresponsive; tb, tuberculosis; TI, treatment-intolerant; WGS, Whole Genome Sequencing; XDR, 
extensively drug-resistant. 
Eleven patients had unfavourable outcomes in the ITT analysis, summarized in the table below. Seven 
patients had unfavourable outcomes due to death, with 6 of the deaths occurring during the treatment 
period and one approximately 6 months after the end of treatment. BL MIC values are not available for 
all patients, due to negative baseline culture or problems with quality of methods at one lab, discussed 
previously. However, it is clear that there is no association between baseline MIC values (all 3 drugs 
evaluated) and outcomes in the NIX-TB study. One patient had an increased baseline MIC for 
bedaquiline, however, this patient died of other reasons than TB at day 75. Four out of 5 patients 
without available BL MICs died for reasons that would not be linked to efficacy problems with the 
regimen. In the 5th case, relapse day 187, the isolate at failure was fully susceptibly to all 3 drugs 
(data not shown).

Sensitivity Analyses 
Patients could enter the study on the basis of a positive culture within 3 months prior to the study; as 
expected a proportion would have a negative baseline culture (turned out to be around 15%).  
When excluding patients who were never culture positive during the baseline period, the outcome is 
fairly identical (90% favourable outcome), see table below.

(29 March 2019 cut off) 
In total, three cases of relapse (2 cases as part of the present mITT population, n=80) have been 
recorded at this cut-off date, where all patients had the chance to pass 6 months EOT, and 44 had 
passed the 24 months follow-up.   
-  Subject 01-9026-018  3 months post EOT (patient died after relapse, non-TB related) 
-  Subject 02-9038-031  2 months post EOT   
-  Subject 02-9006-005  15 months post EOT  
The first patient, with advanced HIV co-infection (low CD4 count), fulfilled therapy with reported high 
compliance, with linezolid dose reductions in second part. For the second patient a low adherence to 
therapy was suspected. The third case is a very late relapse. WGS is lacking to verify that this is the 
same strain and not a re-infection, although resistance data suggests a relapse.  
Ancillary analyses  
The success rate was similar for patients with and without HIV-infection, and the linezolid dosing (600 
mg bid vs 1200 mg qd) also yielded similar outcomes, numerically higher for the 1200 mg dose, see 
tables below.

•  Comparison of Nix-TB outcomes to results obtained in prior XDR/MDR TB studies 
The results obtained in the Nix-TB study may be considered outstanding, and a positive B/R could be 
inferred in the absence of a control arm; results obtained in prior studies are far lower than those seen 
here. 
In order to provide a background of reference data for comparative assessment of the outcomes 
observed in the Nix-TB trial, TB Alliance conducted two additional assessments of XDR-TB treatment.   
-First, the applicant undertook a comprehensive review of the published outcome data in XDR-TB 
patients treated with drugs not including any of the Nix-TB study regimen drugs or delamanid. The 
search (criteria presented in the application) identified 18 studies that met search criteria and that 
described outcomes that could be mapped to the standardized WHO outcome of treatment success.  
These studies reported outcomes in 1731 patients.  The majority of the patients in these studies came 
from South Africa (1300 patients from 8 studies), where the Nix-TB study was conducted.  Rates of 
treatment success across the South Africa studies were consistent, averaging 14%, with a range of 2% 
to 22%.  Outside of South Africa, reported rates of treatment success were more varied, ranging from 
15% to 60%; two studies reported rates above 50%.  
- Second, to evaluate the outcomes in historical comparator groups more closely matched to the Nix-
TB study population, analyses were undertaken of two comprehensive datasets of XDR-TB patients 
treated with a) drug regimens not including bedaquiline, linezolid, or delamanid (N=204) and b) with a 
more contemporary regimen of bedaquiline + linezolid + other agents not including Pretomanid were 
done (N=102, of whom 82% had linezolid as part of the regimen). These data sets were provided by 
the Head of the Division of Pulmonology at the University of Cape Town, (South Africa), and concerns 
patients admitted between 2008-2014, and 2013—2016, respectively.  The proportion with a 
favourable outcome in the first cohort was 13.4%. and in the second around 65% (here counted 
achieving cure or treatment completion), similar in those with and without linezolid. In the latter cohort 
patients were treated with a median of 6 TB drugs in addition to bedaquiline and linezolid; death rate 
was 19/102.  
Details as follows: 
The Nix-TB population included in this comparative analysis consisted of all 109 patients enrolled into 
the trial; these patients were enrolled between April 2015 and November 2017, thus substantially 
overlapping in time with the control cohort.  Both the Nix-TB and the control population were all from 
South Africa, treated in a hospital setting, and 19 died.  There was one potentially significant difference 
in the baseline characteristics.  All the patients in the cohort were diagnosed with XDR-TB, while 
patients in Nix-TB had XDR or TI/NR MDR-TB.   
All 102 control patients received a bedaquiline-based regimen which contained a median of 8 drugs.  
Eighty-two percent also received linezolid.  The control patients received a mean of 16.5 months of

treatment.  All Nix-TB trial patients received 6 months of treatment with the investigational regimen 
except for the patients who died during treatment, one who withdrew during treatment, and 2 who 
extended treatment to 9 months of therapy.

Data are presented as means (standard deviations) for continuous variables and numbers and percents for categorical 
variables. P-values are derived from chi-square tests and Student T-test with equal variance assumption for 
categorical and continuous variables respectively.  Standardized differences are the differences in means for 
continuous variables (or difference in proportions for dichotomous variables) between the two groups divided by the 
pooled standard deviation. 
Patients outcomes were as follows: 
Controls:   
• 
Favourable outcome - (n=66)  
•  Unfavourable Outcomes - Death (n=19), Default (n=1), Treatment Failure (n=5) or Lost to 
Follow-Up (n=11)  
Nix-TB: 
• 
Favourable outcome – (n=98) 
•  Unfavourable Outcomes –Death (n=7), Relapse (n=2), Withdrawn (n=1), or Lost to follow-up 
(n=1) 
The proportion of favourable outcomes in the two populations was different; 89.9% of the Nix-TB 
population had favourable outcomes compared to 64.7% of the control population (Table 36), which 
yielded a significant estimated risk ratio of 1.39 (1.19 – 1.62, 95% CI) of having a favourable outcome 
in the Nix-TB population compared with the control population (Table 32).

Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis comparing the outcomes in the same 
populations for all participants with linezolid in addition to bedaquiline and a background regimen.  
The proportion of favourable outcomes in these subsamples was also different; in the Nix-TB 
population subsample, 89.9% had favourable outcomes compared to 66.7% in the control population 
subsample.  This yielded a significant (P = 0.0003) estimated risk ratio of 1.35 (1.14 – 1.59, 95% CI) 
of having a favourable outcome in the Nix-TB compared with the control population. 
Matched Controls 
A final analysis compared the two population subsamples individually matched by sex, age, body 
weight, and HIV status at baseline.  The outcomes in Nix-TB were very similar between the patients 
with XDR-TB and TI/NR-MDR-TB and thus matching was not done by type of TB infection. To perform 
the matching, a propensity score methodology was applied (Austin 2011).  The propensity score 
matching method was selected because different types of covariates (dichotomous and continuous) 
were used to match subjects.  The results of the matching procedure were effective as there was little 
difference between the two populations. 
The proportion of favourable outcomes in this matched sample was also different; in the Nix-TB 
population subsample, 90.0% had favourable outcomes compared to 63.3% in the control population 
subsample.  This yielded a significant estimated risk ratio of 1.42 (1.20 – 1.69, 95% CI, P<0.0001) 
and significant odds ratio of 4.00 (1.84 – 8.68, 95% CI, P=0.0005) of having a favourable outcome in 
the Nix-TB compared with the control population. 
In addition to the analyses provided by the applicant, the Nix-TB results could also be compared to 
those generated in the C209 study, part of the MAA of bedaquiline (Sirturo). That study included MDR- 
and XDR-TB patients (single arm), and patients received bedaquiline for 6 months on top of an 
optimized background regimen given for a minimum of 18 months. Participants were recruited in 11 
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 75/121 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
countries in Asia, Eastern Europe plus in Peru and South Africa. The proportion of patients with no lung 
cavities were higher in the C209 study (34% vs 16%; bilateral cavities at baseline were seen in 12% of 
patients in C209 vs 38% in the Nix-TB study). Further, HIV co-infection was much less common in 
C209 (4% vs 50% in the Nix-TB study), (Pym et al, 2016). At study completion, 125/205 mITT 
patients (61.0%) were “cured”, 63 (31%) had failed treatment or defaulted/transferred out and 14 
(7%) had died.  In summary, the B-Pa-L, given for 6 months to patients that likley had a more severe 
disease status (including a 50% HIV prevalence, many with a low baseline CD4 count), in a poor 
setting, yielded a markedly higher proportion of favourable outcome than did Bedaquline-based prior 
therapy given for a minimum of 18 months, in many cases in combination with linezolid as part of the 
background regimen.   
Supportive study  
The Pa phase 2 dose ranging studies of 8 weeks duration were summarized at the start of the efficacy 
section. This section concerns the NC-006 study [or STAND, Feb 2015-Nov 2017] which was 
conducted in Georgia, Kenya, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, and 
Tanzania (vast majority recruited in Africa, mainly South Africa) 
The study, non-blinded, evaluated 3 Pa-containing regimens vs control in patients with pulmonary 
tuberculosis; MDR-TB patients were allocated to a specified regimen of 6 months (no control).  
The plan was to include 1500 patients (1200 with DS TB and 300 with MDR-TB). However, the study 
was put on partial hold by the FDA in 2015, due to a potential signal for liver toxicity. When this safety 
hold was lifted in August 2017, the TB Alliance chose not to re-open the study. Already enrolled 
patients (n=284) were followed to the trial end points; the study is therefore significantly 
underpowered. 
DS-TB patients were randomized to receive:  
• 
• 
• 
Pa 100 mg + M 400 + Z 1500 for 4 months (N=65), or 
Pa 200 mg + M 400 + Z 1500 for 4 months (N=71), or 
Pa 200 mg + M 400 + Z 1500 for 6 months (N=67), or 
•  HRZE/HR, standard-of-care regimen for 6 months (N=68). 
MDR-TB patients:  MPa200Z regimen for 6 months (N=13). 
The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the 3 test regimens to 
that seen with the control regimen. Pre-specified hierarchy for ordering of analyses was as follows: the 
high dose regimen for 6 months vs control, followed by high dose 4 months and low dose 4 months vs 
control. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the outcomes of the 6 months MPa200Z regimen in patients 
with MDR-TB versus in patients with DS-TB. 
In this study around 70% of subjects were black, around 15% of mixed race (around 7% Asian and 
5% white). Median BMI was around 19. Overall, around 25% were HIV-positive (even proportions 
between randomized arms). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of bacteriologic failure or relapse or clinical failure 
within 12 months from start of therapy in the DS TB group (non-inferiority to control, with an NI 
margin of 12%).   
EMA/200048/2020  
Page 76/121 
 
  
 
 
 
For the MITT population, 13% of patients were unfavorable in the control group vs 23% in the 
6MPa200Z group, showing a difference of 9.88% (upper bound of the 95% CI for this difference 
=23.89%). Hence, non-inferiority of the test regimen (first in hierarchy) versus control was not 
achieved. Further analyses were not performed. Results in the PP population as well as in sensitivity 
analyses including analysis of all randomized and ITT populations were consistent with the overall 
findings. 
Although the NC-006 study was underpowered as a result of the safety hold, the outcomes obtained 
with the 4 months regimens indicate a very high risk of relapse (9 + 2=11 out of 57 and 6 +1=7 out 
of 46 assessable patients, respectively), see table below.  The failed outcome with the test regimen 
given for 6 months was mainly driven by withdrawals during treatment, and the relapse rate in this 
arm was around 3%.

NC-006 is a failed study, and, despite being under-powered, clearly indicate that the Pa/M/Z regimen 
is not an option in the attempt to shorten treatment duration in DS TB, despite the more rapid early 
bacterial clearance with this regimen as compared to standard HRZE therapy.  
High (unacceptable) relapse rates when shortening therapy to 4 months were seen in two fairly recent 
large scale studies (Gillespie et al, and Merle et al; both studies published in NEJM Oct 2014). 
Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin was added to the common DS TB regimen, and despite the fact that early 
bacterial clearance was more rapid, non-inferiority to HRZE control given for 6 months was not 
achieved. Relapse rates of 10-15% were seen with the shorter regimens. Clearly, it is hard to predict 
final outcomes by early response. 
Despite the safety issues in study NC-006, the same regimen, with the addition of bedaquiline (B-Pa-
M-Z) is being evaluated in a more recent, ongoing study (Simplici-TB or NC-008), where 4 months 
treatment is again tested for patients with DS-TB, and 6 months treatment is tested in patients with 
MDR-TB.  
Ongoing trial 
ZeNix Trial 
The ongoing Phase 3 linezolid optimization study of the BPaL regimen, ZeNix (also referred to as 
NC-007) was designed to optimize linezolid dosing with the aim of potentially limiting toxicity while 
preserving efficacy. The ZeNix trial is a Phase 3 partially-blinded, randomized trial assessing the safety 
and efficacy of various doses and treatment durations of linezolid plus bedaquiline and pretomanid in 
participants with pulmonary infection of either extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), pre-
XDR-TB or treatment intolerant or nonresponsive multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This 
4-arm study randomizes subjects to varying linezolid doses (1200 or 600 mg once daily [QD]) and 
varying lengths of linezolid treatment (2 or 6 months).   A total enrolment of 180 XDR-TB, pre-XDR-
TB, or TI/NR MDR-TB subjects is planned; 45 of those patients will receive BPaL with the linezolid dose 
and duration the same as in Nix-TB.   
The preliminary blinded data shared with the CHMP on-treatment efficacy (N=137) with the B-Pa-L 
regimen for the same treatment population in the ZeNix study (XDR-TB/intolerant or unresponsive 
MDR-TB) provides data supporting Nix-TB results.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Pretomanid has been evaluated in monotherapy (14 days EBA studies) in doses ranging from 50 mg qd 
to 1200 mg qd, where maximum effect was reached with a dose of 200 mg qd. The effect with that 
dose seemed higher than that obtained with 50 mg, while the difference versus results achieved with 
100 and 150 mg qd was minor. All pretomanid doses in these studies were administered in the fasting 
condition, whereas in most of the Phase II-III studies, including Nix-TB, pretomanid was administered 
under fed conditions. Because fed status is the major determinant for the dose-exposure relationship 
(2-4 times higher exposure with food), the interpretation of dose-response results across studies is 
complicated, and it is therefore essential to consider actual plasma exposure as part of the evaluation. 
During 8 weeks of therapy, combining pretomanid and moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide (Pa-M-Z), the 
effect with the 200 mg dose was again somewhat higher (NC-002 study) than that yielded with 100 
mg in DS TB patients, without apparent differences in safety, and this dose of pretomanid has been 
chosen for the further studies in MDR/XDR TB patients.  It should be noted that the systemic exposure 
for both the 100 mg (mean AUCss 39.5 µg*hr/mL) and 200 mg (mean AUCss 80.0 µg*hr/mL) cohort 
in NC-002 was higher than the systemic exposure at 200 mg (30.9-37.9 µg*h/mL) in the 14-day EBA 
studies. 
The clinically proposed dose of 200 mg qd is not strongly supported by the data. Post-hoc exposure-
response analyses were performed, but no reliable relationship could be characterised. A lower target 
exposure threshold for efficacy could therefore not be derived. However, from the available data, it 
does appear that 200 mg QD (with food) would allow plateau effect to be achieved for the majority of 
patients.

Several regimens have been evaluated. In the NC-005 study, bedaquiline was added to the Pa-M-Z 
regimen (B-Pa-M-Z) and evaluated for 8 weeks in MDR-TB patients. The early bactericidal activity of 
this regimen was very promising, which is presently studied in an ongoing study (SimpliciTB); for 4 
months vs 6 months of standard therapy in DS TB patients, and for 6 months in MDR-TB patients 
(results not presented as part of this application). Of note, the Pa-M-Z regimen (without bedaquiline) 
has been evaluated in a phase 3 study in DS TB patients, where 4 months of such therapy was 
associated with a high relapse rate; this regimen is not further studied. 
The regimen for which licensure is sought concerns pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and 
linezolid (B-Pa-L), aimed for XDR-TB patients or MDR-TB patients not responding/being intolerant to 
standard MDR therapy. While this regimen was never studied and compared to the other regimens in 
EBA studies or 8 weeks studies, pre-clinical studies are supportive of the combination. With regards to 
the contribution of the individual agents, the following may be summarized: 
All three agents have potent in vitro activity to MTB (DS-TB as well as XDR-TB strains). In the murine 
model, the B-Pa-L regimen showed substantially higher effects than did any 2-drug combination 
constructed of the 3 agents (B-L, B-Pa, Pa-L). Clinically, the effect size per se in the Nix-TB study is 
considered to verify a contribution of all 3 agents. The highest cure rates so far presented in XDR-TB 
patients (70-80% favourable outcomes in smaller cohorts) were generated with regimens consisting of 
bedaquiline plus linezolid in combination with a large number of other agents (regimens typically 
consisting of 10 agents), and with treatment durations of 2 years; to be compared to the 90% success 
rate with the B-Pa-L regimen given for 6 months. Efficacy (and safety) wise, the issue is not the 
contribution of pretomanid to the efficacy, but rather the time and dose of linezolid needed, which is 
being studied in the ongoing ZeNix study (below). 
The pivotal study (Nix-TB) is a standalone single arm study of 6 months duration. The study included 
109 patients (78 XDR-TB patients, 31 MDR TB patients), and results covering 6 months of follow-up 
post end of treatment (primary end point), with a favourable outcome of 92% in the mITT population 
(90% in ITT) must be considered as outstanding. Results are in line with the cure rate seen in trials of 
DS-TB patients treated with standard of care, and considerably higher than previously reported in 
studies of XDR/MDR-TB patients. The relapse rate at this time point is low (3/107), where all patients 
had a chance to pass 6 months of follow-up EOT, and 44 have passed 24 months of follow-up. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
As discussed, the dose of pretomanid (200 mg qd) used in the Nix-TB, and other ongoing studies, is 
supported on the basis of EBA/8 weeks studies. The dose of bedaquiline used in the Nix-TB study is the 
one approved according to Sirturo labelling. The dose chosen for linezolid (1200 mg qd) is supported 
by outcomes in a specific EBA-study, exploring doses from 300 to 1200 mg per day, as well as 
pharmacokinetics where this dose results in Cmin values that are well above MIC values in MTB. There 
are indications that linezolid, which has an unfavourable safety profile, may be given at a lower dose 
and/or for shorter duration, without a negative impact on efficacy; this is presently studied in a large 
ongoing trial in a similar patient population (the ZeNix study). The BPaL regimens in the ZeNix study 
differ from that of the pivotal Nix-TB study in 3 of 4 study arms, and the ZeNix trial reflects the 
sponsor’s commitment to attempt to improve the benefit-risk ratio for pretomanid in combination with 
bedaquiline and linezolid in the treatment of TI/NR MDR and XDR through further optimization of 
linezolid dosing in the BPaL regimen.  The sponsor has furthermore committed to provide the final 
results of the NixTB trial as well as the results of the ZeNix trial to confirm the outcome of the NixTB 
trial reported so far.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy outcomes in the pivotal study (Nix-TB), generated with pretomanid 200 mg qd, in 
combination with bedaquiline dosed according to label and linezolid dosed 1200 mg qd, all for 6 
months, are considered outstanding, where 98/109 (90%) of the ITT population (98/107 (92%) of 
mITT population) have a negative sputum culture at 6 months past end of treatment. The risk for 
relapse is obviously low.  It is acknowledged that the data are based on a single arm study. However, 
results are consistent for all relevant subgroups of patients within the study, with fully similar results 
for the patients with XDR-TB and MDR-TB, for patients with and without HIV-co-infection. Further, 
preliminary blinded data shared with the CHMP on-treatment efficacy (N=137) with the B-Pa-L regimen 
for the same treatment population in the ZeNix study (XDR-TB/intolerant or unresponsive MDR-TB) 
provides data supporting Nix-TB results. In summary, the efficacy data with the B-Pa-L regimen are 
considered outstanding. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
To confirm the outcome of the NixTB trial and to evaluate efficacy (and safety /tolerability) of various 
doses and durations of linezolid plus bedaquiline and Pretomanid after 26 weeks of treatment in 
participants with either pulmonary XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment intolerant or non-responsive 
MDR-TB the results of the ZeNix trial will be provided.  Final reporting by Q42022.  
In addition, in order to confirm the efficacy of pretomanid the marketing authorisation holder will 
complete and submit results from the ongoing Nix-TB. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Organization of Safety Database 
An integrated safety database was constructed from the individual study databases (19 studies, for 
details see intro to Efficacy section:  three phase 3 studies, 6 phase 2 studies and 10 phase 1 studies.  
The TB Alliance conducted 17/19 studies while two phase 1 studies were conducted by the National 
Institutes of Health. 
The integrated data for the 2 ongoing phase 3 studies, Nix-TB and ZeNix are currently for 109 and 15 
subjects, respectively (26 March 2018).  This data cut-off date is the basis for all integrated safety 
results. Analysis groups of this data base are based on treatment/regimens given, as shown, followed 
by data on pretomanid exposure within clinical program.

The table is not showing exposure by dose of pretomanid, which can be summarized as follows: the 
number of subjects who received pretomanid for 6 months (the minimum duration for the sought 
indication) is limited to around 150 subjects (all treated with the 200 mg dose). When adding those 
who were treated for at least 3 months the number adds up to around 300 subjects. The group who 
received 3-6 months treatment are mainly those treated with Pa – M – Z for 4 or 6 months as part of 
the NC-006 study (DS TB). Of those treated for < 3 months (n=874), around 250 subjects were 
treated for 8 weeks as part of the NC-002 and NC-005 studies (the majority with the 200 mg dose).

Although limited, the safety data base is considered sufficient for the evaluation of safety in the 
context of the MAA, having in mind the patient population for the sought indication, and what other 
alternatives they have. Of note, two fairly large studies are ongoing (NC007 and NC-008) where some 
500 patients will be treated with a pretomanid-containing regimen (pretomanid dosed 200 mg) for 4-6 
months

Nix-TB study – the B-Pa-L regimen 
The combination of B-Pa-L was used in the pivotal study and the application concerns an approval of 
pretomanid as part of this specific regimen.  The safety results in the Nix-TB should be viewed, firstly 
with the known toxicities of B and L in mind, and secondly with the safety (and efficacy) of present 
alternative (non-Pa containing) regimens for XDR TB patients (or MDR TB patients who cannot tolerate 
or do not respond to recommended MDR TB regimens) in mind.  
The main established ADRs of bedaquiline is liver reactions (mainly asymptomatic increases of 
transaminases typically seen after a number of weeks of therapy) and QT-prolongation (again with a 
slow onset in study C208, reaching a maximum of around 15 msec after 12-16 weeks of treatment). 
Pancreatitis is a potential safety issue on the basis of pre-clinical findings, but clinical cases were not 
seen in the C208 study and were not reported in bedaquiline PSURs so far. 
Linezolid has a mitochondrial toxicity which has been studied in some detail (reference e.g. Milosevic 
2018).  The mechanism of action is impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis; the effect is 
reversible, and the mitochondrial function is normalizing much faster than what is seen with the 
mitochondrial toxicity caused by toxic nukes of HIV therapy, such as stavudine (effects on 
mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial numbers). The toxicity is dose and duration dependent and 
typical associated ADRs are neuropathy, myelosuppression and lactic acidosis. 
Target organs of pretomanid toxicity in pre-clinical studies concern central nervous (ocular, 
convulsions), respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. In mouse and rat studies with pretomanid, 
several hepatotoxic effects were observed, while for monkeys there were fewer findings. Testicular 
toxicity was observed in male mice and rats in all repeat-dose studies, but not in monkeys. Modest, 
but likely acceptable margins of safety relative to the expected exposure for the 200 mg/day dose in 
humans were shown (2-4 times).  Cardiovascular effects (QT) were not seen in a thorough single dose 
QT study (doses 400 and 1000 mg). The QT study was however, inconclusive as this study was flawed 
with several insufficiencies (see further below). 
Adverse events 
Common AEs reported from the Nix-TB study are only briefly summarized. Having in mind the patient 
population, the focus is on serious adverse events, AEs of special interest, numbers needing to stop 
therapy due to AEs (and in particular ADRs), and deaths.

Discontinuation/interruption and dose reduction of linezolid occurred frequently, this is discussed in a 
subsection below. Those who permanently stopped the entire regimen were those who died (not 
treatment related according to investigators). 
As outlined in the efficacy section, linezolid dosing was changed from 600 mg bid to 1200 mg qd when 
44/109 patients had entered the study (i.e. not randomized).  
Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in all patients. The most frequently (≥10% of subjects) reported

There were some differences in frequency of AEs by linezolid dosing, however numbers are low, and 
patients are not randomized to either dosing schedule. For the main linezolid toxicity, neuropathy, 
there is a numerical difference (not significant) favoring the BID regimen. In contrast, anemia (second 
most common problem) was more frequently reported with the BID regimen.  Increased transaminases 
were numerically less common with the QD dosing schedule. However, overall the safety profile did not 
differ markedly by qd or bid dosing.

Maximum TEAE grades of 3 and 4 were reported in 37.6% and 15.6% of subjects, respectively.  The 
most frequently (≥2 subjects [1.8%]) reported TEAEs with graded 3 and 4 were as follows: 
Grade 3 
Grade 4 
peripheral sensory neuropathy 
/neuropathy peripheral (20.2%) 
transaminases increased (5.5%)   
amylase increased/hyperamylasemia (8.3%) 
GT increased (4.6%) 
lipase increased (3.7%) 
anemia (3.7%) 
neutropenia (2.8%) 
bone marrow failure (1.8%) 
abdominal pain upper (1.8%). 
hypoglycemia (2.8%), and for following 1.8% (n=2) 
for each term 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
pneumonia 
pulmonary tuberculosis 
sepsis 
anemia 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 
Neuropathy linked to linezolid was graded 1-2 in the majority of cases (total frequency 78%), and 
resulted in a large proportion of linezolid dose reductions/interruptions/discontinuations (discussed 
later). Increased transaminases are a known ADR of bedaquiline, with an ALT grade 3 increase in 5.1% 
in the C208 study (vs 1.3% in the placebo arm). The frequency of increased amylase and lipase 
(where lipase is considered more specific for pancreatitis) is fairly high. This is a potential ADR of 
bedaquiline (according to the Situro RMP), with a 2.6% incidence of amylase increase grade 3 in the 
C208 study (low numbers).  Two cases of pancreatitis were reported in the Nix-TB study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
An overall summary of serious TEAEs reported in Nix-TB is shown below. In a subsequent table more 
details are provided.  To a great extent the events are those expected in patients with severe TB (50% 
co-infected with HIV, including those with low CD4 counts), and few events are considered related to 
therapy. The majority of the latter events are likely linked to linezolid (anemia, neutropenia). The one 
case of “lactic acidosis” was reported as part of a sepsis (i.e. the term is in a way misleading).

Natural causes 
In one case (acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis) causality with respect to treatment cannot be ruled out. 
The other 5 deaths that occurred during the treatment period are not indicative of causality to the 
regimen. Another two deaths occurred: one during the 6-month follow-up after EOT and the second 
more than 1 year after EOT. 
AEs leading to dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation 
Refer to Efficacy section around rules for interruptions of linezolid/full regimen, and dose reductions 
(linezolid).  
Discontinuation of study treatment: No patients, except those 6 who died during therapy, 
permanently stopped the entire B-Pa-L regimen. 
In addition to those 6 cases, linezolid was permanently discontinued in 28 patients (28 of remaining 
103 patients =being 27%), and in the vast majority of cases due to peripheral neuropathy (compare to 
grade 3 neuropathy reported in 20% of the patients, section on AEs above).  
Interruption of study treatment: The entire regimen was interrupted at least once in 20 patients 
(18%); 41 events. Reasons for interruptions were spread on a large number events (similar to the AE 
frequency), with maximum 2 events per term. 
Linezolid was interrupted at least once in 50 subjects (46%), 70 events, dominated by peripheral 
neuropathy (two terms combined), 23%, and anaemia, 16%. The total mean duration of linezolid dose 
interruption was 44 days (min 2 days, maximum 145 days).   
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 91/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
Reduction of linezolid dose: The linezolid dose was reduced at least once in 69 patients (63%) and 
the reasons were mainly due to peripheral neuropathy, 30 patients (28%) and anaemia, 13 patients 
(12%). The incidence of onset of events for peripheral neuropathy increased steadily over time: 
≤2 weeks, 5%, >2 weeks to 8 weeks, 21%, >8 weeks to 26 weeks, 65% 
The rate of dose interruption/reduction due to myelosuppression (in practice anaemia) was greatest 
from week 4 to week 12. 
As a consequence of (mainly) these two major toxicities, neuropathy and anaemia, the rate of linezolid 
dose reductions/interruptions increased steadily from week 4 to week 20, see the figure below.  
Figure 5.   Time to First Dose Interruption and/or Dose Reduction of Linezolid due to an AE 
(Population Safety) 
Patients were assessed for peripheral neuropathy at each visit by the use of a questionnaire and 
examinations were done monthly through treatment, and at the follow-up time points. A key question 
in the questionnaire was “During the past 14 days have you had pain, aching or burning in your feet or 
legs? The response to this question is visualized in the graph below.  
Figure 6 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 92/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In summary, peripheral neuropathy was very frequent with the present dosing schedule, mild in most 
cases, and for the most reversible, however a proportion of patients reported symptoms (higher than 
at baseline) still 2 years post EOT. Of those 44 patients with a follow-up of 24 months, 14 had a higher 
total neuropathy score at this time point than at baseline. In 9 of these 14 cases the score was low at 
the 24 months follow-up (5 out of total 30 points) and lower than their scores at EOT; in 2 cases with a 
maximum score at EOT the score was reduced to half. The remaining 3 patients reported a 
considerably higher score at the 24 months follow-up timepoint than at the previous time points 
(however data are hard to interpret).  
Upon request, a guide on how to manage linezolid dosing in the case of typical linezolid toxicities has 
been introduced in the Pretomanid SmPC, since relevant information is not provided in the Linezolid 
SmPC (where a maximum of 28 days of Linezolid therapy is recommended).  
The ZeNix study is ongoing, with the target to find a more optimized linezolid dose (B-Pa-L, with 4 
different dosing schedules for linezolid). 
AEs of special interest (B-Pa-L) 
  Pretomanid 
Cataracts – Lens Disorders  
Cataract development was observed in rats in long term toxicity studies. No cataract development was 
seen in monkeys. Due to the rat findings, since July 2009, clinical studies of pretomanid given for >14 
days have included slit-lamp examinations with AREDS2 scoring of lens opacities. 
In the Nix-TB study, slit lamp examinations were done at screening, Week 26, and 3 months after 
completion of treatment to assess potential development of cataracts. The applicant concluded that the 
findings of small percentages of both increases and decreases in AREDS2 scores suggest normal 
variation in the rates and/or age-related changes, i.e. no signal was seen for cataract formation. 
Per 26 March 2018, data were available for 175 eyes in 88 subjects in Nix-TB. Score increases 
(worsening) of ≥1 from baseline for cortical, nuclear, and posterior subcapsular opacity were observed 
in 3 (1.7%), 2 (1.1%), and 6 (3.4%) eyes, respectively. Conversely, score decreases (improvement) 
of ≥1 from baseline were observed in 4 (2.3%), 13 (7.4%), and 0 (0%) eyes for cortical, nuclear, and 
posterior subcapsular opacity, respectively. One subject had an AREDS2 score increase of ≥2 from 
baseline. It was concluded that this patient might have already developed lens opacities when initially 
screened, which then progressed over the following months.  
In NC-006, a score increase (worsening) of ≥1 from baseline in cortical opacity was observed in 2 eyes 
(1.6%) in the 100 mg PaMZ group and 1 eye (0.8%) in the 4-month 200 mg PaMZ group. Three eyes 
(2.3%) in the 4-month 200 mg PaMZ group and 4 eyes (2.7%) in the 6-month 200 mg PaMZ showed 
increases of ≥1 from baseline in nuclear opacity scores. Increases of ≥1 from baseline in posterior 
subcapsular scores were observed in all treatment groups: 3 eyes (2.4%), 2 eyes (1.5%), 1 eye 
(0.7%), and 1 eye (0.8%) for 100 mg PaMZ, 4-month 200 mg PaMZ, 6-month 200 mg PaMZ, and 
HRZE control, respectively. Three subjects in Study NC-006 had an increase of ≥2 in AREDS2 score. 
It is acknowledged that based on the currently available data (and the doses and durations studied), it 
is difficult to see any clear clinically meaningful effect of pretomanid on the potential for cataract 
formation. However, ocular monitoring should be continued in the pretomanid clinical development 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 93/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
program in order to collect more data, and according to the study protocol for ZeNix, this is attended 
to. In study NC-006, there was one subject reporting an event of cataract (treated with the 6MPa200Z 
regimen) in the DS-TB pooling group. This subject seems to be the only subject among the included 
patients in the pretomanid safety database that reported an AE with the term “cataract”. There was 
also one subject treated with the same regimen reporting “lenticular opacities”. It is stated that all of 
the reported events in the SMQ of Lens disorder in the all-pretomanid group resolved.  
Convulsions  
Convulsions and other CNS-related effects were seen with pretomanid administration in rats and mice, 
at plasma exposures at least 2-fold higher than those yielded with the 200 mg dose. In summary, no 
signal for an increased risk of seizures was seen in the Nix-TB study. Two patients experienced serious 
convulsions (grade 3), however, both cases were considered heavily confounded (prior seizures, 
advanced tuberculoma in the brain). 
Convulsions have been reported to occur in patients when treated with linezolid. In most of these 
cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported. However, whether pretomanid 
might add to that risk currently not known. 
Testicular Degeneration 
Testicular toxicity, reflected in seminiferous tubule degeneration, germ cell depletion, and infertility, 
was observed in mice and rats treated with pretomanid for 3 months.  The effects were reversible in 
rats given lower doses (at edge of having toxic effects) and with shorter duration, but irreversible at 
high doses for longer durations. Effects were also seen on sexually mature male monkeys given daily 
oral doses of ≥150 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks (decreased sperm count and motility and an increased 
ratio of abnormal to normal sperm), in this case without histopathological testicular findings. 
Reproductive hormone levels (testosterone, LH and FSH) were evaluated in male subjects in 
Studies NC-002, NC-005 (both 8 weeks duration), and NC-006 (16 or 24 weeks duration).  The 
findings from the 3 studies showed no evidence that pretomanid is a testicular toxicant in humans at 
the doses and exposure times evaluated (up to 26 weeks). However, the results are insufficient in 
order to exclude that pretomanid may exhibit testicular toxicity.  
A male reproductive study is planned to evaluate whether 6 months of pretomanid 200 mg daily dosing 
has an effect on sperm parameters and associated male reproductive hormones.  A final report 
submission is predicted for 1Q 2024.  
Liver toxicity 
Liver safety was pre-defined as an adverse event of special interest of pretomanid on basis of pre-
clinical findings. This is the main safety issues in parts of the program (mainly the Pa-M-Z regimen), in 
particular in the NC-006 study, which was halted for reasons of liver safety. A thorough assessment of 
liver safety in the entire program, including that seen in the Nix-TB study, is placed in a separate 
section below. 
  Bedaquiline  
(Pancreatitis) Amylase and lipase elevations were frequent in the Nix-TB study (grade 3-4 amylase in 
17/109 and grade 3-4 lipase in 6/109). Of note, enzyme elevations (in particular amylase) were quite 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 94/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
frequent already at baseline. Further, the frequency of graded enzyme toxicity was fully similar with 
the Pa-B-Z regimen as with HRZE control in the NC-005 study.  
There were 3 cases reported as clinical pancreatitis. One fatal case of multiorgan failure + 
haemorrhagic pancreatitis, where a causality to the regimen cannot be ruled out. The other 2 reported 
cases are questionable; one concerned a patient without enzyme elevations and other evidence of 
pancreatitis (resolved) and the other reported case was asymptomatic and enzyme elevations were 
present already at baseline. No clinical cases of pancreatitis were reported from the other studies in 
the Pa-program.  
There is no indication for an association of pancreatitis (or such enzyme elevations) to pretomanid 
therapy per se when looking at the entire program. The non-clinical studies did not indicate that 
pretomanid affected the pancreas.  
(Rhabdomyolysis/myopathy) In the NIX-TB study these events (reported by around 10% of patients) 
were grade 1 or 2, except one case (grade 3). None were considered serious.  
(Liver safety and QT-prolongation) These issues are discussed in separate sections later.  
  Linezolid 
Linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, with a consequent risk for peripheral neuropathy and hematopoietic 
cytopenias (dose reductions/interruptions discussed above), optic nerve disorders and lactic acidosis.  
In the Nix-TB study monthly ophthalmic examination (visual acuity and colour assessment) was part of 
the study procedures, in line with the recommendations provided in the linezolid SmPC. Two subjects 
were diagnosed with optic neuritis (one grade 4, one grade 1). Both events started after week 16, and 
both resolved when linezolid treatment was stopped.  
Lactic acidosis: Eight (7.3%) patients reported TEAEs associated with lactic acidosis. All TEAEs resulted 
in study drugs being interrupted (7 patients) or withdrawn (1 patient). Linezolid was interrupted for 
four TEAEs, BPaL regimen for two TEAEs, and study drug(s) was not recorded for one TEAE. All except 
one TEAE had resolved by the data cut-off date. The unresolved event was hyperlactacidemia which 
occurred in one of the patients who died (cause of death was stated to be pneumonia and septic 
shock). Lactic acidosis is described as an AE of linezolid, however, it occurs rather rarely (unknown 
frequency in the SmPC of linezolid). Trial centres did not have the capability to test arterial blood gas 
parameters to confirm the diagnosis of acidosis and the incidence may have been underestimated. The 
risk of lactic acidosis with the regimen (i.e. linezolid) is reflected in the SmPC.

DS-TB pooling group 
When comparing frequencies of AEs (and graded lab toxicities) between pretomanid monotherapy in 
phase 2 (CL-007 and CL-010, total N=122) and HRZE control, differences in treatment durations 
between these groups must be taken into account, table below.

Pretomanid monotherapy 
For the phase 2 pretomanid-alone pooling group (i.e., monotherapy with pretomanid): The highest 
proportion of patients reporting AEs occurred in the category skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(10/122, 8.2%) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (8/122, 6.6%) and headache (3/122, 2.5%).  
It is noted that skin-related AEs seems to be rather frequently reported with pretomanid alone and 
when pretomanid is combined with other anti-TB drugs. In the non-clinical documentation, it was 
shown that oral administration of pretomanid at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day to rats, followed by 
exposure to UVR, elicited cutaneous reactions indicative of phototoxicity (erythema, grade 1 barely 
perceptible light redness) in the non-pigmented and/or pigmented skin sites. There was no signal of 
photo toxicity in the clinical studies.  Of note, in the monotherapy studies, pretomanid was 
administered without food. As the bioavailability of pretomanid 200 mg seems to be approximately 
halved when administered in the fasting condition compared with in the fed condition, the 
representativeness of the incidences of AEs reported from the additional studies examining pretomanid 
alone at the proposed clinical dose is questioned. Furthermore, absorption became saturated in the 
fasting condition, and increasing doses led to significantly less than dose proportional increases in 
exposure. The studied exposure margin may therefore be considerably smaller than implied by the 
studied dose range. 
Pretomanid combination therapy  
Two different regimens have been tested for 8 weeks or longer in DS-TB patients, Pa-M-Z in studies 
NC002 (8 weeks) and NC006 (16 or 24 weeks), and B-Pa-Z in study NC005 (8 weeks), with HRZE/HR 
control in all 3 studies. The latter 3 studies cover 444/534 (83%) of the patients treated with Pa 
combination therapy in the DS pooling group. The remaining 90 were those treated in 14-day EBA-
studies (NC-001 [Pa-M-Z, Pa-Z, Pa-B] and NC-003 [Pa in several combinations], also here with HRZE 
as control).

The frequencies of grade 4 events reported in the studies of longer duration (8 weeks in NC-002 and 
NC-005; 16-24 weeks in study NC-006) are shown below. Numbers who discontinued study drugs were 
indeed high with the test regimens, around twice as frequent as with control. Liver reactions/chemistry 
are the driver of the difference.

Of note, study NC-006 was halted due to severe liver events (3 fatal events with the test regimen, 
onset at around week 5 in all 3 cases). A large number of serious liver related events were reported in 
the test arms, none with control, see the table below. The frequency of grade 4 events with the test 
regimen given for 6 months was very high (20.9%), and 11/67 (16.4%) discontinued study drug due 
to an AE during the 6 months course (vs 5.9% in the control arm, same treatment duration).

Deaths (DS-TB pooling group) 
Deaths occurring in this group are shown in the table below; the deaths only occurred in the studies of 
longer duration. It is noted that many of the death occurred a long time after treatment was stopped 
(not considered related to study drug). 
The main reasons for treatment emergent deaths were TB complications. Three patients died in NC-
006, of liver failure, possibly related to the Pa-M-Z regimen.

MDR-TB pooling group 
This concerns MDR-TB patients in NC002, NC005 and NC-006: 
NC-002: Pa200-M-Z  
(N=26, 8 weeks) 
NC-005: B(200 daily)-Pa200-M-Z 
(N=60, 8 weeks) 
NC-006: Pa200-M-Z  
(N=13, 6 months) 
98% of the patients were recruited in Africa (75% in South Africa and 23% in Uganda); 38% where 
co-infected with HIV.  
The majority (part of NC-005) were treated with the B-Pa-M-Z (for 8 weeks), the regimen presently 
evaluated in Simplici-TB (NC-008). There is no randomized control (HRZE control concerned DS TB 
subjects). Hence, the safety evaluation of the MDR-TB pooling group is less informative than that of 
the DS-TB pooling group. 
Despite the fact that the vast majority were treated for a limited duration of 8 weeks, grade 4 events 
were reported in 6/99 patients (as compared to 1/109 with the B-Pa-L regimen given for 6 months in 
the Nix-TB study), and the same number discontinued the study regimen (as compared to none of the 
103 who survived in the Nix-TB study).

The most frequent grade 3 or 4 TEAEs concerned ALT and AST increases, and this was, again, the main 
driver of treatment discontinuations.

Five deaths were reported in the MDR-TB pooling group, all were considered non-related to study drug 
and 4 out of the 5 deaths occurred a long time after test therapy was completed.  
Evaluation of liver safety in the pretomanid program 
No major liver safety findings were seen in the pre-clinical program; hepatocellular hypertrophy in 
repeat dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and monkeys with pretomanid at high dose levels were 
considered an adaptive response. In addition, a few instances of minimally increased serum 
transaminase activity in rats and one instance of single-cell hepatocellular necrosis in mice at dose 
levels that exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and were not the major cause of animal morbidity. 
No relevant ALT toxicity was seen with pretomanid monotherapy in studies CL-007 (doses 200-1200 
mg) and CL-010 (doses 50-200 mg), where around 15 patients per dose arm (total 121 patients) were 
treated for 14 days. 
B-Pa-L regimen (Nix-TB) 
In Nix-TB, consideration of stopping study drug administration, at least temporarily, in subjects with 
liver function abnormalities or signs and symptoms of hepatitis was to be discussed with medical 
monitor in the following situations.  
•  ALT or AST >8 x ULN 
•  ALT or AST >5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks  
•  ALT or AST >3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%). 
• 
IF ALT / AST ≥ 3 X ULN and Total Bilirubin >2x ULN, the IMP should be interrupted and the 
subject’s clinical course discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
More or less identical stopping rules applied in the other studies (discussed below). 
In 8/109 patients (7%) treatment was interrupted due to liver enzyme elevations; all were able to re-
start without further clinically relevant elevations. No liver-related deaths were seen in the Nix-TB 
study. 
With regards to ALT/AST toxicity, data from the Nix-TB study are shown below.

The figures for the BPaL regimen are considered reassuring; the frequency of grade 4 toxicity is low 
(with a toxicity scale defining grade 4 as > 8 x ULN, a modest increase in clinical practice).

Pa-M-Z and B-Pa-M-Z regimens (NC-006 and NC-008) 
NC-006 explored 3 different PaMZ regimens vs control in DS-TB patients. An additional arm included 
MDR-TB patients (not randomized, data not shown here). 
Three fatal liver events were seen with the test regimen, all 3 had a similar pattern with an onset of 
ALT/AST elevations after 2-3 weeks of therapy, rapidly increasing to extreme values and fulminant liver 
failure shortly thereafter.  In all 3 cases the liver tests were normal at study entry and prior to the time 
patients fell ill (with GI symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea). The cases are indicative of severe drug 
toxicity. These cases resulted in a safety hold, initiated by DSMC and followed by the FDA, which was 
lifted after an analysis of overall data provided by the applicant. A fatal case of live failure had also 
occurred with the HRZE control regimen, and the ratio of test treatment vs control was 3:1. 
Liver related treatment emergent AEs were more frequent with the test regimens than with control; 
around twice as frequent in the study arm of 6 months duration (i.e. same duration as HRZE/HR 
control). Numbers withdrawn from the study, as well as discontinuing therapy due to hepatic events 
were substantially higher with the test regimen given for 6 months as compared to HRZE/HR control 
(around 12% vs 3%), less marked for those treated with the 4 months test regimens. Graded ALT/AST 
toxicity, considerably more frequent with the test regimen, see table below.

The reasons for the frequent and seemingly severe toxicity in NC-006 are not clear, and this raised 
concerns about the liver safety of pretomanid, at least as part of this particular regimen.

It was questioned whether the severe liver toxicity seen in some cases in the studies above may be 
due to an PD interaction between Pa and pyrazinamide.  
However, from what is known around transporters and the metabolism of the agents no reasons were 
found to suspect pretomanid as a victim of pyrazinamide. The other way around, potential effects of Pa 
on the metabolism of pyrazinamide cannot be ruled out.  
In the NC-005 study pyrazinamide and its metabolites were indeed analysed. Regimens and results are 
shown in the table below. The exposure of pyrazinamide and its metabolites is very similar with B-Pa-Z 
as with HRZE control.  
In contrast it is noted that the level of 5-hydroxypyrazinoic acid (5-OH-PA) is around 2-fold higher with 
the addition of moxifloxacin (arm 4). The effect on 5-OH-PA is of interest since it has been cited as the 
major mediator of toxicity (Shih, et al, 2013; Rawat, et al, 2018), although there is disagreement on 
this matter (Tostmann, et al, 2010). However, there are in fact no relevant difference in frequencies of 
liver related AEs, severe liver related AEs and graded ALT/AST toxicities with the 3 different test 
regimens in NC-005 t (Table 52).

The applicant concluded that there are no clear indications for a PD interaction between Pa and 
pyrazinamide. This is endorsed, with the caveat that Pa metabolites have not been thoroughly studied 
and fully understood. Further, that the finding of high 5-OH-PA exposures (potentially toxic driver of 
pyrazinamide) in the regimen that included moxifloxacin not necessarily explains the toxicity findings 
in NC-006. This is agreed.  Of note,  in a very large study exploring 3 different regimens for DS TB 
(1:1:1, N=1930); 6 months of HRZE vs 2 experimental arms where moxifloxacin replaced isoniazid (H) 
and ethambutol respectively (i.e. was given with pyrazinamide for the first 8 weeks), no difference in 
hepatic safety was seen between arms (Gillespie et al 2014). 
Figures on hepatic toxicity (grade ¾ ALT toxicity or potential HY´s law cases) in the Safety analysis 
pooling groups do not point to a relevant difference of risk by gender. 
QT changes – review of the pretomanid program 
On the basis of pre-clinical data, pretomanid has a potential for QT-prolongation (see pre-clinical 
section). In a thorough QT-study in healthy volunteers (Study DMID-10-0058, single centre in the 
U.S.), pretomanid in single doses of 400 mg and 1000 mg yielded minor QTc effects of 2.7 and 4.5 
msec, versus an expected +10.9 msec with 400 mg moxifloxacin. When combining Pa 400 mg and 
moxifloxacin, the effect was 12.5 msec (additive). Hence, no relevant QTc increase would be expected 
with the 200 mg dose, on the basis of single dose data. However, the thorough QT study may be 
considered inconclusive (see further above under “Secondary pharmacology”).  
Having those results in mind, mean QTc changes from baseline were higher than expected in the 
clinical studies with the Pa-M-Z regimen (around + 20 msec), since pyrazinamide is not known to 
cause an increase.  The B-Pa-M-Z regimen yielded, over time, an increase of around 25 msec (NC-005, 
8 weeks duration). In contrast, the B-Pa-L regimen in Nix-TB yielded a modest increase of 10 msec, 
somewhat lower than expected.

When scrutinizing data, a main difference noted between subjects in the Nix-TB study and the other 
studies is a substantial difference in baseline QTc values. Among all subjects, the median baseline 
QTcF was 414.5 ms in Nix-TB (and similar in the ongoing ZeNix, 408 ms), but around 390 ms in NC-
002, NC-005, and NC-006. A reasonable, yet speculative, explanation to that difference in baseline QTc 
values would be a residual QT-prolongating effect of the previous failing regimens for patients included 
in Nix-TB and ZeNix, while the other studies included newly diagnosed patients without TB therapy.  
When looking at treatment emergent, potentially clinically relevant ECG results in the Nix-TB study it is 
noted that only 5/109 had a QTc of >480 ms, and 1/109 >500 msec on treatment.  However, it has to 
be kept in mind that the Nix-TB study was not designed in order to fully detect the adverse effects on 
the QT interval of the pretomanid + bedaquiline combination. Few patients were examined, there was 
no comparator group and ECG was recorded before the trial drugs were administered (i.e. not at Cmax) 
and with low frequency. 
Further QTc data was presented for all subjects in Nix-TB who died from “natural causes”, “cause 
unknown” or “worsening of TB”. These data do not indicate that unclear deaths were attributed to 
treatment related QTc increases. Reported cases of cardiac-related AEs in the Nix-TB study (e.g., 
dizziness, palpitations, hypotension and syncope grade 3) were also scrutinized. There were 14 
patients with reported AEs that possibly could be cardiac-related. For four of these patients there were 
no information as the events occurred outside the treatment window. For the majority of remaining 
patients (6), there were no ECG recordings at the time the AEs occurred (the Nix-TB study did not 
employ continuous ECG recordings). Notwithstanding this limitation, for the ECGs that were recorded, 
no reading showed QTcF over 440 ms before or after the events in any of the patients.  
In summary, the totality of data indicates that pretomanid has a more QT-prolongating effect than 
what is seen in the thorough QTc study. However, the results obtained in the Nix-TB study are still 
compatible with an acceptable profile that can be handled with appropriate patient selection, 
monitoring and stopping criteria, which will be implemented in the SmPC.

Laboratory findings  
Liver chemistry, discussed in the previous section, is not repeated below. 
With pretomanid monotherapy (2 weeks, studies CL-007, CL-010, doses of 50 mg to 1200 mg daily) 
there were no relevant changes in haematology parameters; mean decreases in platelets was seen in 
some arms, including with HRZE control. For other lab chemistry, a moderate increase in creatinine 
was noted with doses 200 mg qd and higher. A maximum of around +15 umol/L were seen at doses 
600 mg qd and higher.  However, no findings were seen in urine analyses (including, among other 
parameters, protein, glucose, microalbumin, blood, leukocytes). This indicates inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine, however which transporter that is inhibited has not been clarified. Increases of 
amylase were seen in all treatment arms in these studies, including with HRZE control, without any 
pattern indicating a specific problem for pretomanid. 
Nix-TB (B-Pa-L) 
Graded toxicity of interest, outside liver chemistry, is shown below. Decreases in haemoglobin, and 
less marked in neutrophils, is linked to linezolid therapy, where the frequency of linezolid dose 
interruptions/reductions and discontinuations due to anaemia were discussed previously. 
Change from baseline in creatinine has been summarized for the first 45 patients at the data cut off. 
The pattern was very similar to that seen in the study CL-007 with an increase of around 15 umol/L 
from week 2 and onwards. This is not considered a cause of concern.

In the DS-TB pooling group, no signals for specific lab toxicity, outside liver chemistry, were seen when 
comparing the test regimens vs control. In these studies, there were no indications for myelo-

suppressive effect of pretomanid (linked to linezolid in the B-Pa-L regimen).  In this pooling group 
increases in amylase and lipase were similar with Pa combo as with control (similar 
exposures/durations for test and control).  Still, having in mind the very high frequency in the Nix-TB 
study (B-Pa-L regimen), for which bedaquiline has a potential for an impact on these enzymes, it could 
be interesting to compare the frequencies of graded toxicities in the randomized DS-TB patients in 
studies NC-002 vs NC-005, for which baseline characteristics seem quite similar, including around 20% 
HIV co-infected patients in both studies. 
Safety in special populations 
No data, neither efficacy/safety nor PK data, has been generated in special populations, such as 
patients with renal or liver impairment, children etc. Only a handful of patients in the clinical studies 
(all combined) were aged 65 years or older, and a safety assessment by age is therefore not relevant. 
With regards to sex, the gender mix is fairly even in the larger studies. The main safety issue is liver 
safety, and figures on hepatic toxicity (grade 3-4 ALT toxicity or potential HY´s law cases) in the 
Safety analysis pooling groups did not point to a relevant difference of risk by gender. 
The lack of PK data in patients with severe renal impairment is considered acceptable, having 
metabolism/elimination in mind.  
Immunological events 
There seems to be very few TEAEs reported as “hypersensitivity” in the pretomanid database. There 
was one subject reporting a serious TEAE of hypersensitivity in the all-pretomanid group in the DS-TB 
pooling group. This subject received the PaMZ regimen (100 mg pretomanid daily), the event started 
on study Day 59 (12 days after the final dose of trial medication), lasted 9 days and were considered 
moderate in severity. The event was considered related to treatment of gouty arthritis with allopurinol, 
this drug was stopped, and the event resolved. One other subject in the DS-TB pooling group, 
receiving PaMZ (100 mg pretomanid daily) discontinued the study due to a TEAE described by the 
investigator as “drug induced hypersensitivity skin reaction moxifloxacin”. The event was resolved and 
considered “moderate” in severity. There were a few other TEAEs (some cases of e.g. dermatitis 
allergic, rash, pruritus, eczema and other PTs connected to the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders in addition to PT like conjunctivitis allergic) that could potentially represent allergic reactions 
to treatment. It is possibly only the data from the phase 2 pretomanid-alone pooling group that could 
assist in elucidating this potential risk for pretomanid. In total 10/122 subjects reported different types 
of rash from this pooling group, but there has been no targeted discussion by the applicant of this 
issue. In the non-clinical part, there are indications of pretomanid being the cause of immunotoxicity in 
some species. There were no AEs in the safety data set indicative of immunotoxicity. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The issue of a potential PD interaction was raised and is discussed in the Liver safety and QTc sections. 
In summary, there is no evidence for such interactions at present. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Pretomanid in monotherapy in doses 50-1200 mg per day was well tolerated over 14 days treatment 
(EBA studies). Reported AEs were mainly grade 1, with no high frequencies for any particular SOC, and 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 106/121 
 
 
  
  
 
graded lab toxicity was unremarkable, including liver enzymes (none had a grade 2 shift from 
baseline). In the monotherapy studies, pretomanid was administered without food. As the 
bioavailability of pretomanid 200 mg seems to be approximately halved when administered in the 
fasting condition compared with in the fed condition, the representativeness of the incidences of AEs 
reported in these studies of limited duration is limited. Furthermore, absorption became saturated in 
the fasting condition, and increasing doses led to significantly less than dose proportional increases in 
exposure. The studied exposure margin is therefore considerably smaller than implied by the studied 
dose range. 
Liver safety – main safety issue in the program as a whole, but not with the B-Pa-L regimen 
The applicant is seeking approval for pretomanid as part the specific B-Pa-L regimen on the basis of 
outcomes in the Nix-TB study. Liver safety in this study, of limited size (N=109), is considered re-
assuring. Graded ALT toxicity was rather common, but grade 4 toxicity (here 8 x ULN) was only seen in 
1/109 patients in the Nix-TB study, a low figure for a treatment regimen of XDR-TB patients.  While 
8/109 interrupted the regimen due to ALT increases, in accordance with the protocol and by rules that 
are being reflected in the SmPC, all of these patients could resume and finish treatment. No deaths in 
the study were related to liver toxicity.  
The liver safety in study NC-006 raised serious concerns around the liver safety of pretomanid as part 
of the Pa-M-Z regimen with 3 fatal liver events/203 treated and a high frequency of ALT 3/4 toxicity. 
With regards to deaths, 1 fatal liver event was seen also in the HRZE control group, and patients were 
allocated to test vs HRZE in a ratio of 3:1.  
In summary, liver safety with the B-Pa-L regimen is considered acceptable, and manageable. There is 
presently no clear understanding of whether the pretomanid component could explain a potentially 
worse safety profile of the other regimens, where both moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide (per se) have an 
acknowledged DILI potential. Adequate wordings around frequent liver monitoring during treatment 
and stopping rules are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Linezolid toxicity – the main identified safety issue for the B-Pa-L regimen 
Linezolid has a mitochondrial toxicity, which is dose and duration dependent, and typical associated 
ADRs are neuropathy, myelosuppression and lactic acidosis. With the 1200 mg daily dose throughout 6 
months of treatment that was used in the Nix-TB study, incidences of neuropathy and anaemia are 
very high, with a high need for dose interruptions/reductions and discontinuations. While anaemia 
typically occurred within the first 12 weeks, neuropathy typically started after 8 weeks of therapy. 
Linezolid was permanently discontinued in around one third of the patients and interrupted in around 
50%; dose reductions were common (> 60% had to reduce the linezolid dose at least once). 
Neuropathy was mild in most cases, and for the most reversible. A proportion of patients reported 
symptoms (higher score than at baseline) still 2 years post EOT, for the most at a low score, or with a 
substantial reduction as compared to a very high score at EOT. A guide on how to manage linezolid 
dosing in the case of typical linezolid toxicities has been introduced in the Pretomanid SmPC, since 
such information is not provided in the Linezolid SmPc (where a maximum of 28 days of Linezolid 
therapy is recommended). The ZeNix study, presently evaluating optimized dosing schedules for 
linezolid, is predicted to be fully recruited within 1Q2020, and with top line results for efficacy (6 
months of follow-up) in July 2021. 
Another potential issue of the B-Pa-L regimen is bedaquiline and pancreatitis. One of the deaths in the 
Nix-TB study was a fatal event of haemorrhagic pancreatitis with multi-organ failure, where causality 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 107/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
to the regimen could not be ruled out. However, when viewing enzyme elevations and pancreatic 
events (very few) in the pretomanid program as a whole, there are no indications for an association to 
pretomanid. Furthermore, in the non-clinical documentation, there were no signs of pretomanid 
affecting the pancreas. 
QT-prolongation with Pa-containing therapy 
QT-prolongation is an issue of MDR/XDR-TB therapy, since several agents used in recommended 
treatment regimens have such a potential (bedaquiline, delamanid, some of the quinolones, 
clofazamine). While pre-clinical studies indicate a potential for QT prolongation for pretomanid, no 
relevant QTc prolongation was seen with a single dose of 400 mg in a thorough QT study (twice the 
dose used in the present regimen). Furthermore, when combined with moxifloxacin the modest effect 
was simply additive reflecting mainly the known QTc prolonging effect of the latter. However, the 
thorough QT study is considered inconclusive due to several insufficiencies, including the single dose 
design.  
When looking at the entire program, a higher impact of pretomanid on QT prolongation than that seen 
in the thorough QT study is predicted. However, the number of patients with maximum QTc values of 
levels associated with a substantial risk of arrythmia with the B-Pa-L regimen in the Nix-TB study were 
low; 5/109 had a maximum QTc of >480 msec, and 1/109 >500 msec. However, it has to be noted 
that the Nix-TB study had some limitations in that respect; few patients were examined, there was no 
comparator group and ECG was recorded before the trial drugs were administered (i.e. not at Cmax) 
and with low frequency. 
In conclusion, although the QTc effect of pretomanid has not been fully elucidated, the issue can be 
managed by appropriate patient selection, monitoring and stopping rules, which will be part of the 
SmPC. Further dedicated studies are not considered likely to yield further information that would 
impact these recommendations. 
Deaths in Nix-TB and the other studies 
In the Nix-TB study six patients died prior to completion of therapy, and another two quite some time 
thereafter.  Apart from the patient who potentially died due to pancreatitis, other treatment emergent 
deaths concern deaths in other infections (sepsis) or worsening of TB, where an association to therapy 
is not suspected.  
Deaths occurring during treatment/follow-up in the other clinical studies were not considered 
associated to the study treatment, with the potential exception of the 3 cases of deaths in liver failure 
in study NC-006. Other causes of death were related to tuberculosis, other infections and accidents. 
Each death in Nix-TB is a complex combination of many factors such as the underlying disease of XDR-
TB, other concomitant medical conditions and use of a variety of co-medications (including the 3 study 
drugs). This makes it challenging to pinpoint specific drugs and/or medical reasons as definite causes 
for the deaths.  
Other uncertainties 
From the non-clinical studies, it was observed a toxic effect of pretomanid on testes and male fertility. 
The duration of the follow-up periods for examining pretomanid’s possible detrimental effect on male 
fertility in humans was limited to 8 weeks in the phase 2 studies NC-002 and NC-005 and 26 weeks in 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 108/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the prematurely terminated phase 3 study NC-006. Analyses of hormones did not point to negative 
effects, but semen analyses have not been performed. A dedicated study is planned where both semen 
and hormones will be studied for 6 months therapy of 200 mg pretomand daily therapy.  
Convulsion and other CNS-related effects were seen with pretomanid administration in rats and mice. 
Two subjects in Nix-TB experienced serious convulsions (grade 3); whether the combination of linezolid 
and pretomanid might increase the risk of provoking convulsions is not known. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported from the Nix-TB trial have been included in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
An optimized dosing of linezolid is being studied in the ZeNix study, concerning the same treatment 
population (Category 2 study).  
2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Pretomanid as part of the specific regimen B-Pa-L shows an acceptable safety profile in the Nix-TB 
study. One main obstacle of this regimen is linezolid toxicity, in particular peripheral neuropathy, and it 
is clear that the dose/duration is not optimized yet.  Linezolid is however considered manageable, and 
instructions around dose adjustments in cases of toxicity are provided in the SmPC. Of note, linezolid 
toxicity is an issue also for alternative (non-pretomanid) regimens, as linezolid is a recommended part 
of XDR-TB therapy for efficacy reasons. 
Liver safety is an important safety concern but considered acceptable and manageable for the B-Pa-L 
regimen. Frequent liver monitoring is crucial, and instructions on when to interrupt the regimen is 
presented in the SmPC. 
The impact of Pretomanid, and of the B-Pa-L regimen, on QTc has not been fully characterized. 
However, this is a recognized safety issue of pretomanid as well as of bedaquiline. Results obtained in 
the Nix-TB study are compatible with an acceptable profile that can be handled. Appropriate patient 
selection, monitoring and stopping criteria are therefore mandated, and are implemented in the SmPC. 
Further dedicated studies are not considered meaningful. 
Testicular toxicity is a potential safety concern on the basis of pre-clinical studies in rats. Human 
toxicity cannot be ruled out on the basis of the data studied in the clinical studies so far (hormonal 
levels). A dedicated study, which will study the also any impact on sperm quality, has been initiated. 
In summary, the safety profile of pretomanid as part of the Pa-B-L regimen for treatment of patients 
with XDR-TB, and/or MDR-TB and not responding to/tolerating the MDR-TB regimen, is considered 
acceptable. However, due to the limited number of patients treated for 6 months or more, and the 
single arm nature of the data providing information on the safety of the B-Pa-L, available data are 
considered non-comprehensive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA:

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date IBD. The IBD is 14.08.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of pretomanid with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers pretomanid to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
EMA/200048/2020

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The group has agreed to grant an English only label for the following components: Outer carton for the 
blister, outer carton for the bottle, blister label and bottle label.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Pretomanid FGK (pretomanid) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it pertains a conditional marketing authorisation for a product 
containing a new active substance.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tuberculosis remains one of the world’s major causes of illness and death – prompting the WHO in 
1993 to declare tuberculosis to be a global health emergency.  While tuberculosis is found in every 
country in the world, it disproportionately affects people in resource-poor settings, particularly those in 
Asia and Africa, but outbreaks still occur in industrialized nations. Approximately one quarter of the 
world’s population are infected with M. tuberculosis (WHO 2018), and where the risk to fall ill in active 
disease is many times higher in case of immunosuppression, e.g. in case of (untreated) HIV-infection. 
In 2017 there were an estimated 10 million incident cases of tuberculosis (around 10% co-infected 
with HIV), and 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis.  Emerging resistance is a great threat to TB 
therapy – in 2017 the number of cases of MDR-B (rifampicin resistance) was estimated to 330,000, 
and where the proportion of these cases fulfilling criteria for XDR-TB (resistance to isoniazid, 
rifampicin, quinolones and at least one injectable agent) is increasing.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prior to the approval of bedaquiline in 2013/2014 typical cure rates of XDR-TB patients in the high 
epidemic setting were very low, around 15%, despite two years of therapy with multiple agents. 
Following that approval and with the use of off-label linezolid, treatment success have increased, 
where some groups more recently have reported cure rates of 70-80%. However, the latter regimens 
were complex, typically including >10 drugs, and with treatment durations of around 2 years. For 
MDR-TB (less advanced resistance) regimens are also still complex, with a large number of agents and 
with treatment durations of at least 9 months. Hence, new shorter and standardized regimens are 
highly warranted for the treatment of XDR-TB, as well as for MDR-TB patients who have tolerability 
problems with present therapies.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The TB Alliance has systematically tested various pretomanid-containing regimens aimed to simplify 
MDR-TB therapy, as well as to shorten standard therapy for patients with Drug Sensitive TB (DS-TB). 
As part of this program, the Nix-TB study, pivotal for this application, was initiated in April 2015. This 
single arm study (N=109), which is running at 3 MDR-TB centres in South Africa, concerns the hardest 
to treat, i.e. patients with XDR-TB and patients with MDR-TB who are intolerant/non-responsive to the 
MDR-TB regimen. Around 50% of the patients are co-infected with HIV, and the baseline disease 
characteristics very severe. The regimen is standardized and includes only three agents: bedaquiline 
(dosed according to label), pretomanid (dosed 200 mg daily) and linezolid (dosed 1200 mg daily) (the 
“B-Pa-L” regimen). The treatment duration is 6 months, which could be extended to 9 months if the 
patient was still culture positive after 4 months of therapy (occurring in only 1/109, who had a 
favourable outcome with 6 months of therapy). The Nix-TB study was the first clinical trial to test the 
B-Pa-L regimen, which had shown promising results in a murine TB model. Baseline resistance to any 
of the three agents is still very low also in the XDR-TB setting. 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 114/121 
 
 
  
  
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint (negative sputum culture 6 months after EOT) was achieved by 98/109 patients 
(ITT 90%, mITT 98/107 (92%)) 
Furthermore, secondary endpoint data at 24 months follow-up from EOT is provided in 47 patients who 
were evaluable for efficacy at this timepoint, demonstrating a relapse-free cure rate is largely 
sustained at 87%. 
The success rate was similar in XDR-TB (89%) and MDR-TB (92%) patients and identical in those with 
or without HIV co-infection.  The outcome was unfavourable in 8/80 for the primary endpoint, and this 
concerns 2 relapses and 6 deaths (4 cases directly/indirectly associated to severe TB disease, 1 case of 
upper GI bleeding and 1 case of haemorrhagic pancreatitis). 
A comparison of the BPaL regimen of the Nix-TB study with a contemporaneous and geographically 
matched control group where all patients received bedaquiline and 82% of patients received linezolid, 
showed superior efficacy of the BPaL regimen, with cure rates of 89.9% and 64.7%, respectively 
(P<0.0001). The contribution of pretomanid to the treatment effect is supported by animal model data 
indicating additive effects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Nix-TB is a single-armed study of limited size; thus, there is no calibration with regards to the cure 
rate in the selected population with standard of care.  
The primary endpoint data concern the outcome 6 months post end of treatment. In prior analyses, 
based on other treatment regimens, around of 80% of all relapses occurred within that time period 
(90% within 12 months). Data in 47 patients that have reached 24 months are supportive; however, 
the small dataset of available data constitute a limitation on the long-term outcomes.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common TEAEs in the pivotal study, occurring in ≥10% of patients, were peripheral 
neuropathy, nausea, anemia, vomiting, headache, dyspepsia, dermatitis acneiform, decreased 
appetite, GGT increased, rash, pruritus, transaminases increased, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal 
pain and hyperamylasaemia. With regards to more common AEs (i.e. potential ADRs) causality to the 
regimen and individual agents are hard to assess, considering the patients population studied.  
The present B-Pa-L regimen includes linezolid dosed 1200 mg daily throughout the treatment duration, 
where, notably, linezolid is a preferred XDR-TB agent also with other regimens. Linezolid has a well-
established mitochondrial toxicity and is outside the XDR-TB setting therefore seldom used for 
prolonged times (more than 4 weeks of therapy is off-label use). This toxicity resulted in a high 
frequency of peripheral neuropathy (total frequency around 70%, mainly grade 1-2) and anaemia 
(around 35%), resulting in a high frequency of linezolid dose reductions/interruptions and 
discontinuations: linezolid was interrupted at least once in around 50% of the patients (mean total 
duration of interruptions around 6 weeks), and discontinued in around 25% of the patients. Over 60% 
of the patients had to reduce the dose of linezolid at least once. 
The entire regimen was halted (but not discontinued) in a modest number of patients (7%), a low 
number in the setting of XDR TB therapy. In these cases, the interruptions were mainly caused by 
increases in liver enzymes, where it is unclear what agent that caused the reactions, since also 
bedaquiline (and possibly other co-medications) has the potential for such reactions. In all cases 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 115/121 
 
 
  
  
therapy could be re-started and therapy completed. Of note, the SmPC includes a detailed guidance 
around monitoring of liver enzymes, and how to handle cases of enzyme elevations. 
Pretomanid appears to contribute to the QTc prolonging effects of the BPaL regimen, which also 
includes bedaquiline, a known QT-prolongator. The SmPC includes instructions on appropriate 
monitoring. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Pretomanid was administered without food in the monotherapy studies (dosed 100 to 1200 mg), and in 
fed state in longer term efficacy and safety studies (dosed 100 or 200 mg). The food effect is around 
+50%, and further, absorption became saturated in the fasting condition. The studied exposure margin 
is therefore smaller than implied by the studied dose range. 
While pretomanid has a half-life of 16h, the t1/2 of total plasma radioactivity in the mass balance 
study is significantly longer. Despite extraction attempts, a proportion of the radioactivity remains 
unextractable (39% unextracted based on AUC0-48). Unextractable radioactivity associated with 
plasma proteins might be the reason to the long t1/2 of 18 days for total plasma radioactivity. The 
composition of the unextractable radioactivity is unknown, as is its reactive potential. The sum of 
unextractable radioactivity is however qualified in non-clinical species. 
Pretomanid liver safety in this clinical setting of XDR-TB is deemed acceptable on basis of Nix-TB data 
(the B-Pa-L regimen, tested without a control group). Only 1/109 patients had an ALT/AST grade 4 
increase, and those who stopped the regimen due to liver enzyme elevations (8/109) could all resume 
therapy and complete the planned treatment duration. No grade 3-4 ALT increases were seen during 
short term monotherapy up to 1200 mg qd. In contrast, seemingly worrisome data were seen in a 
planned phase 3 study, NC-006, which was halted by the FDA for reasons of liver safety (safety hold 
later lifted). In this study Pa-M-Z was given for 4 or 6 months and was compared to HRZE-control in 
DS-TB patients. Of those randomized to Pa-M-Z, 12% had ALT/AST elevations > 10 x ULN (grade 4) 
and liver chemistry/toxicity lead to treatment discontinuations in many cases. Three patients (still Pa-
M-Z-arms) had fulminant liver failures with a fatal outcome, all 3 with an onset around week 4-5.  Of 
note, one liver related death was seen also in the control arm, and patients were randomized 3:1 (test 
regimen vs control). The reasons for the high frequency of severe liver reactions in NC-006 is 
unknown. Although the liver safety of pretomanid is not fully understood, present data are deemed 
acceptable, and detailed stopping criteria are provided in the SmPC.  
On basis of pre-clinical data, pretomanid has a potential for QT-prolongation, but the results in a single 
dose thorough QT study would predict no relevant effect for doses used in the clinical studies (100 or 
200 mg qd, with 200 mg in the Nix-TB study). However, this QT study is considered to have 
deficiencies, including the single dose design.  Across other studies a varying degree of QTc increase is 
seen. Based on the totality of data a QTc increase higher than that seen in thorough QT study is 
expected. When looking at treatment emergent, potentially clinically relevant ECG results in the Nix-TB 
study it is noted that 5/109 were reported to have a QTc reading of >480 msec, and 1/109 >500 
msec. The Nix-TB study was not designed in order to fully detect the adverse effects on the QT interval 
of the pretomanid + bedaquiline combination. Notwithstanding this, the uncertainty is considered 
manageable, with proper selection of patients, and monitoring in accordance with relevant wordings in 
section 4.4. of the SmPC.  
In non-clinical studies a toxic effect of pretomanid on testes and male fertility was observed. The 
duration of the follow-up periods for examining pretomanid’s possible detrimental effect on male 
fertility in humans was limited to 8 weeks in the phase 2 studies NC-002 and NC-005 and 26 weeks in 
the prematurely terminated phase 3 study NC-006. A dedicated study on semen is planned.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A favourable treatment outcome of 90% in XDR/TB patients, and MDR-TB patients intolerant/non-
responsive to their MDR-TB regimen, with the use of standardized 6 months treatment course 
consisting of 3 agents is an outstanding result. The applicant has provided further contextualisation, 
comparing outcomes with 102 concurrent control patients treated in a single large centre in Cape 
Town, South Africa (which also participated in Nix-TB) who received a bedaquiline-based regimen 
which contained a median of 8 drugs, including linezolid in 82% of cases. This cohort consisted of XDR-
TB only. The median duration of treatment was 16.5 months, to be compared with the 6 months with 
BPaL regimen. The proportion with a favourable outcome was around 65% (here counted as all 
patients with a sputum conversion 6 months EOT, or having fulfilled treatment), compared to 90% 
with the considerably simpler B-Pa-L regimen. Given the considerable value of treatment simplification, 
also in case the relative increment in efficacy of BPaL would be overestimated, the regimen would still 
constitute an important improvement in TB treatment. In addition, preliminary data from the ZeNix 
study are supportive of the effects seen with the B-Pa-L regimen in the Nix-TB study. 
The single-arm design of the study makes it difficult to discern any AEs caused specifically by 
pretomanid from the AEs instigated by bedaquiline and linezolid. Few patients have been treated with 
the BPaL regimen and important patient groups have not been studied (e.g., patients with renal and 
hepatic impairment, elderly and patients that might be prone to QT prolongations or increases in liver 
transaminases). Possible additive and/or synergistic effects of pretomanid on potentially serious AEs 
caused by one of the other drugs in the triplet is not known, especially with regards to fragile patient 
groups. 
One important obstacle with the present regimen is the high frequency of linezolid-associated side 
effects (neuropathy and anaemia) as a result of the 1200 mg daily dose given throughout the 
treatment course. However, linezolid is a recommended agent also in alternative regimens in XDR-TB 
therapy (85% in the mentioned concurrent cohort), and these side effects were manageable with the 
use of dosing rules that are provided in the SmPC. An optimized dosing schedule of linezolid is 
presently evaluated in the ZeNix study (N=180). 
Apart from linezolid-related adverse events, liver toxicity and QTc prolongation have been identified as 
important risks when using the BPaL regimen. The liver safety in the Nix-TB study was acceptable, and 
those few patients who halted the regimen due to ALT increases could resume and complete therapy 
without further problems. Supportive preliminary data have been presented for the B-Pa-L regimen 
from the ZeNix-study. Although the impact of Pretomanid on QTc has not been fully characterized and 
is likely larger than predicted in the thorough QT study, this uncertainty is considered manageable, 
with proper selection of patients, and monitoring of patients. Of note, substantial QT prolongation is a 
general issue for available XDR TB regimens, where several agents have such properties. 
In summary, the safety profile of the BPaL regimen is considered acceptable and the AEs manageable 
provided that close monitoring and surveillance of the patients during treatment and follow-up is in 
place.  However, due to the limited number of patients treated for 6 months or more, and the single 
arm nature of the data providing information on the safety of the B-Pa-L, available data are considered 
non-comprehensive. 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 117/121 
 
 
  
  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy with pretomanid as part of the B-Pa-L regimen is considered to outweigh the risks for 
treatment of patients with XDR-TB or patients with MDR-TB intolerant/unresponsive to the MDR TB 
regimen, on the basis of efficacy and safety based on the available data. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Since safety data are deemed non-comprehensive, it needs to be justified that the prerequisites for a 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation are fulfilled. The balance of benefits and risks is however 
considered positive. 
It is recognised that a randomised controlled trial versus the presently recommended XDR-TB 
regimens is not feasible. The ongoing ZeNix study, however, is anticipated to provide a further 
understanding of the safety profile of the B-Pa-L regimen, including the frequency of hepatic reactions 
and issues related to QT prolongation, and will, as an additional benefit, provide further data on the 
optimal linezolid dose. Given the progress of this study, it is likely that the applicant will be able to 
provide comprehensive data. 
Given the efficacy seen in the pivotal Nix-TB study, as well as the shortening of XDR therapy to six 
months, the product addresses an unmet need and provides a major therapeutic advantage over all 
available therapies for the treatment of XDR-TB/ unresponsive MDR-TB infection.  
Therefore, notwithstanding the non-comprehensiveness of safety data, benefits to public health of the 
immediate availability of the medicinal product outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional 
data are still required.  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant.   
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The ongoing ZeNix study 
(examining linezolid dose and duration within this treatment regimen) will give more data on 
efficacy of the regimen as well as gather information on an optimized dose of linezolid, limiting the 
side effects of that agent. In addition, 24 months follow-up data of the Nix-TB study will also 
become available. Overall, this is expected to provide comprehensive data about the efficacy and 
safety of pretomanid in the proposed indication. Both studies are ongoing and the applicant is 
expected to be able to provide the results. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as in adult patients with pulmonary extensively drug 
resistant (XDR), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, 
the improved efficacy and considerably shorter and simpler treatment regimen are marked 
improvements compared to currently authorised treatments for these patients. 
EMA/200048/2020 
Page 118/121 
 
 
  
  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the considerable value of treatment simplification, also 
in case the relative increment in efficacy of BPaL would be overestimated, the regimen would still 
constitute an important improvement in TB treatment. In addition, preliminary data from the ZeNix 
study are supportive of the effects seen with the B-Pa-L regimen in the Nix-TB study, decreasing 
the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Pretomanid in the presently sought indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Pretomanid FGK is not similar to Sirturo (bedaquiline 
fumarate), Granupas (para-aminosalicylic acid) or Deltyba (delamanid) within the meaning of Article 3 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  See Appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Pretomanid FGK is favourable in the following indication: 
Pretomanid FGK is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the treatment 
of pulmonary extensively drug resistant (XDR), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-
resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB), see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1.  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

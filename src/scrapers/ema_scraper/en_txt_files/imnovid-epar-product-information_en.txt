Hepatic impairment 
Patients with serum total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal range) were excluded from 
clinical studies. Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide 
(see section 5.2). No adjustment of the starting dose of pomalidomide is required for patients with 
hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh criteria. However, patients with hepatic impairment 
should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions and dose reduction or interruption of 
pomalidomide should be used as needed. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of pomalidomide is required for patients with renal impairment. On haemodialysis 
days, patients should take their pomalidomide dose following haemodialysis. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of pomalidomide in children aged 0-17 years for the indication of multiple 
myeloma. 
Outside its authorised indications, pomalidomide has been studied in children aged 4 to 18 years with 
recurrent or progressive brain tumours, however the results of studies did not allow to conclude that 
the benefits of such use outweigh the risks. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2.  
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Imnovid hard capsules should be taken orally at the same time each day. The capsules should not be 
opened, broken or chewed (see section 6.6). The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with 
water, with or without food. If the patient forgets to take a dose of pomalidomide on one day, then the 
patient should take the normal prescribed dose as scheduled on the next day. Patients should not adjust 
the dose to make up for a missing dose on previous days. 
It is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby 
reducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Pregnancy. 
• 
•  Women of childbearing potential, unless all the conditions of the pregnancy prevention 
programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Male patients unable to follow or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see 
section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
• 
• 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Teratogenicity 
Pomalidomide must not be taken during pregnancy, since a teratogenic effect is expected. 
Pomalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that 
causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and 
rabbits when administered during the period of major organogenesis (see section 5.3). 
The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there 
is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. 
Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential 
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered of non-childbearing potential if 
she meets at least one of the following criteria: 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy 
or during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential) 
Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist 
Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy 
XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. 
Counselling 
For women of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are 
met: 
• 
• 
She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks 
before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after 
the end of treatment 
Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhoea she must follow all the advice on 
effective contraception 
She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy 
She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as pomalidomide is dispensed 
following a negative pregnancy test 
She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks 
except in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation 
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with 
the use of pomalidomide. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: 
• 
The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. 
• 
For male patients taking pomalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that pomalidomide is 
present in human semen during treatment. As a precaution, and taking into account special populations 
with potentially prolonged elimination time such as hepatic impairment, all male patients taking 
pomalidomide must meet the following conditions: 
• 
He understands the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
woman or a woman of childbearing potential 
He understands the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
woman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, throughout 
treatment duration, during dose interruption and for 7 days after dose interruptions and/or 
cessation of treatment. This includes vasectomised males who should wear a condom if engaged 
in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential as seminal fluid 
may still contain pomalidomide in the absence of spermatozoa. 
He understands that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking pomalidomide or 
7 days after he has stopped taking pomalidomide, he should inform his treating physician 
immediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or 
experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
• 
• 
Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 
4 weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after pomalidomide therapy and 
even in case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence 
confirmed on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be 
referred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that 
contraception can be initiated. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Implant 
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 
Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot 
Tubal sterilisation 
Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two 
negative semen analyses 
Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) 
• 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also 
section 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to 
one of the effective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 
4-6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may 
be reduced during cotreatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be 
considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Insertion of copper-releasing intrauterine devices is not recommended due to the potential risks of 
infection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with severe 
neutropenia or severe thrombocytopenia. 
Pregnancy testing 
According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 
25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This 
requirement includes women of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous 
abstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same 
day. Dispensing of pomalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of 
the prescription. 
Prior to starting treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when 
pomalidomide is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had 
been using effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not 
pregnant when she starts treatment with pomalidomide. 
Follow-up and end of treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least 
4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy 
tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the 
prescriber. 
Additional precautions 
Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any 
unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. 
Patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose 
interruptions) and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of pomalidomide. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or 
capsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or 
capsule (see section 6.6) 
Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to pomalidomide, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder will provide educational material to healthcare professionals to reinforce the warnings about 
the expected teratogenicity of pomalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before treatment is 
started, and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform the 
patient about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in 
the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational 
brochure, patient card and/or equivalent tool as agreed with each National Competent Authority. In 
collaboration with each National Competent Authority, a controlled access programme has been 
implemented which includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and /or 
dispensing controls, and the collection of information relating to the indication in order to monitor the 
off-label use within the national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and 
dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of pomalidomide to women of childbearing 
potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription and following a medically supervised negative 
pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for women of childbearing potential can be for a maximum 
duration of treatment of 4 weeks according to the approved indications dosing regimens (see 
section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can be for a maximum duration of 12 weeks. 
Haematological events 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reaction in patients 
with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, followed by anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Patients 
should be monitored for haematological adverse reactions, especially neutropenia. Patients should be 
advised to report febrile episodes promptly. Physicians should observe patients for signs of bleeding 
including epistaxes, especially with use of concomitant medicinal products known to increase the risk 
of bleeding (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be monitored at baseline, weekly for the 
first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. A dose modification may be required (see section 4.2). Patients 
may require use of blood product support and /or growth factors. 
Thromboembolic events 
Patients receiving pomalidomide either in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone or in 
combination with dexamethasone have developed venous thromboembolic events (predominantly 
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thrombotic events (myocardial infarction 
and cerebrovascular accident) (see section 4.8). Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism 
– including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimise 
all modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Patients and physicians 
are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients should be 
instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, arm 
or leg swelling. Anti-coagulation therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended, (such as 
acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin, heparin or clopidogrel), especially in patients with additional thrombotic 
risk factors. A decision to take prophylactic measures should be made after a careful assessment of the 
individual patient’s underlying risk factors. In clinical studies, patients received prophylactic 
acetylsalicylic acid or alternative anti-thrombotic therapy. The use of erythropoietic agents carries a 
risk of thrombotic events including thromboembolism. Therefore, erythropoietic agents, as well as 
other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, should be used with caution. 
Thyroid disorders 
Cases of hypothyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid conditions influencing 
thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing monitoring of 
thyroid function is recommended. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Patients with ongoing ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from clinical studies with 
pomalidomide. Appropriate caution should be exercised when considering the treatment of such 
patients with pomalidomide. 
Significant cardiac dysfunction 
Patients with significant cardiac dysfunction (congestive heart failure [NY Heart Association Class III 
or IV]; myocardial infarction within 12 months of starting study; unstable or poorly controlled angina 
pectoris) were excluded from clinical studies with pomalidomide. Cardiac events, including 
congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary oedema and atrial fibrillation (see section 4.8), have been 
reported, mainly in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors. Appropriate 
caution should be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients with pomalidomide, 
including periodic monitoring for signs or symptoms of cardiac events. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Patients at greatest risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to 
treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies, such as non-melanoma skin cancer, have been reported in patients 
receiving pomalidomide (see section 4.8). Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and 
during treatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence of second primary malignancies and 
institute treatment as indicated. 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe dermatologic reactions including SJS, TEN and 
DRESS have been reported with the use of pomalidomide (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised 
of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and should be told to seek medical 
attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. Pomalidomide must be discontinued for 
exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed 
following discontinuation for these reactions. Patients with a prior history of serious allergic reactions 
associated with thalidomide or lenalidomide were excluded from clinical studies. Such patients may be 
at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions and should not receive pomalidomide. Pomalidomide 
interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Pomalidomide must be 
discontinued permanently for angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. 
Dizziness and confusion 
Dizziness and confusional state have been reported with pomalidomide. Patients must avoid situations 
where dizziness or confusion may be a problem and not to take other medicinal products that may 
cause dizziness or confusion without first seeking medical advice. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
ILD and related events, including cases of pneumonitis, have been observed with pomalidomide. 
Careful assessment of patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms 
should be performed to exclude ILD. Pomalidomide should be interrupted pending investigation of 
these symptoms and if ILD is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be initiated. Pomalidomide 
should only be resumed after a thorough evaluation of the benefits and the risks.

Hepatic disorders 
Markedly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have been observed in patients 
treated with pomalidomide (see section 4.8). There have also been cases of hepatitis that resulted in 
discontinuation of pomalidomide. Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended for the first 
6 months of treatment with pomalidomide and as clinically indicated thereafter. 
Infections 
Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving pomalidomide in 
combination with dexamethasone who have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). 
Some of these cases have progressed to acute hepatic failure, resulting in discontinuation of 
pomalidomide. Hepatitis B virus status should be established before initiating treatment with 
pomalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with 
expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when 
pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is used in patients previously infected with HBV, 
including patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. These patients should be closely 
monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, including fatal cases, have been reported with 
pomalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with 
pomalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or 
prior treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at 
regular intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or 
worsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also 
be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms 
that the patient is not aware of. 
The evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of 
the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) or a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional 
follow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is 
confirmed, pomalidomide must be permanently discontinued. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of pomalidomide on other medicinal products 
Pomalidomide is not anticipated to cause clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions due to 
P450 isoenzyme inhibition or induction or transporter inhibition when co-administered with substrates 
of these enzymes or transporters. The potential for such interactions, including the potential impact of 
pomalidomide on the pharmacokinetics of combined oral contraceptives, has not been evaluated 
clinically (see section 4.4 Teratogenicity). 
Effect of other medicinal products on pomalidomide 
Pomalidomide is partly metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5. It is also a substrate for P-
glycoprotein. Co-administration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically relevant effect on 
exposure to pomalidomide. Co-administration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with 
pomalidomide in the presence of ketoconazole, increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 107% 
with a 90% confidence interval [91% to 124%] compared to pomalidomide plus ketoconazole. In a 
second study to evaluate the contribution of a CYP1A2 inhibitor alone to metabolism changes, co-
administration of fluvoxamine alone with pomalidomide increased mean exposure to pomalidomide 
by 125% with a 90% confidence interval [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong 
inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and fluvoxamine) are co-administered with 
pomalidomide, reduce the dose of pomalidomide by 50%. 
Dexamethasone 
Co-administration of multiple doses of up to 4 mg pomalidomide with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone 
(a weak to moderate inducer of several CYP enzymes including CYP3A) to patients with multiple 
myeloma had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared with pomalidomide 
administered alone. 
The effect of dexamethasone on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin concentration is 
advised during treatment. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in 
a woman treated with pomalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a 
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a 
partner of a male patient taking pomalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a 
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. Pomalidomide is present 
in human semen. As a precaution, all male patients taking pomalidomide should use condoms 
throughout treatment duration, during dose interruption and for 7 days after cessation of treatment if 
their partner is pregnant or of childbearing potential and has no contraception (see sections 4.3 and 
4.4). 
Pregnancy 
A teratogenic effect of pomalidomide in humans is expected. Pomalidomide is contraindicated during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential, except when all the conditions for pregnancy 
prevention have been met (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pomalidomide is excreted in human milk. Pomalidomide was detected in milk 
of lactating rats following administration to the mother. Because of the potential for adverse reactions 
in breastfed infants from pomalidomide, a decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue the medicinal product, taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of the therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Pomalidomide was found to impact negatively on fertility and be teratogenic in animals. 
Pomalidomide crossed the placenta and was detected in foetal blood following administration to 
pregnant rabbits (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pomalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, 
depressed level of consciousness, confusion, and dizziness have been reported with the use of 
pomalidomide. If affected, patients should be instructed not to drive cars, use machines or perform 
hazardous tasks while being treated with pomalidomide.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The frequencies in this section are from clinical studies in patients receiving pomalidomide treatment 
in combination either with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Pom+Btz+Dex) or with dexamethasone 
(Pom+Dex). 
Teratogenicity 
Pomalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic 
in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of major organogenesis (see sections 4.6 
and 5.3). If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of pomalidomide in humans 
is expected (see section 4.4). 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
Neutropenia occurred in up to 54.0% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients (47.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). 
Neutropenia led to pomalidomide discontinuation in 0.7% of any patients and was infrequently 
serious.  
Febrile neutropenia (FN) was reported in 3.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 6.7% (Pom+Dex) 
patients and was serious in 1.8% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 4.0% (Pom+Dex) patients (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4). 
Thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 27.0% (Pom+Dex) patients.  
Thrombocytopenia was Grade 3 or 4 in 28.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 20.7% (Pom+Dex) 
patients, led to pomalidomide discontinuation in 0.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 0.7% (Pom+Dex) 
patients, and was serious in 0.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.7% (Pom+Dex) patients (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia tended to occur more frequently within the first 2 cycles of 
treatment with pomalidomide in combination either with bortezomib and dexamethasone or with 
dexamethasone 
Infection 
Infection was the most common non haematological toxicity. 
Infection occurred in 83.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 55.0% (Pom+Dex) patients (34.9% 
(Pom+Btz+Dex) and 24.0% (Pom+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). Upper respiratory tract infection and 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pneumonia were the most frequently occurring infections. Fatal infections (Grade 5) occurred in 
4.0% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 2.7% (Pom+Dex) patients. Infections led to pomalidomide 
discontinuation in 3.6% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 2.0% (Pom+Dex) patients. 
Thromboembolic events 
Prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid (and other anticoagulants in high-risk patients) was mandatory 
for all patients in clinical studies. Anticoagulation therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 12.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 3.3% (Pom+Dex) 
patients (5.8 % (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.3% (Pom+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). VTE was reported as serious in 
4.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.7% (Pom+Dex) patients, no fatal reactions were reported, and VTE was 
associated with pomalidomide discontinuation in up to 2.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) of patients. 
Peripheral neuropathy - Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
Patients with ongoing peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 with pain within 14 days prior to 
randomisation were excluded from clinical trials. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 55.4 % of patients 
(10.8% Grade 3; 0.7% Grade 4). Exposure-adjusted rates were comparable across treatment arms. 
Approximately 30% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy had a history of neuropathy at 
baseline. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation of bortezomib in approximately 14.4% of 
patients, pomalidomide in 1.8% and dexamethasone in 1.8% of patients in the Pom+Btz+Dex arm and 
8.9% of patients in the Btz+Dex arm.  
Peripheral neuropathy - Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
Patients with ongoing peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 were excluded from clinical studies. Peripheral 
neuropathy occurred in 12.3% of patients (1.0% Grade 3 or 4). No peripheral neuropathy reactions 
were reported as serious, and peripheral neuropathy led to dose discontinuation in 0.3% of patients 
(see section 4.4). 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhagic disorders have been reported with pomalidomide, especially in patients with risk factors 
such as concomitant medicinal products that increase susceptibility to bleeding. Haemorrhagic events 
have included epistaxis, intracranial haemorrhage and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS 
have been reported with the use of pomalidomide. Patients with a history of severe rash associated 
with lenalidomide or thalidomide should not receive pomalidomide (see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
Adverse reactions reported in paediatric patients (aged 4 to 18 years) with recurrent or progressive 
brain tumours were consistent with the known pomalidomide safety profile in adult patients (see 
section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Pomalidomide doses as high as 50 mg as a single dose in healthy volunteers have been studied without 
reporting serious adverse reactions related to overdose. Doses as high as 10 mg once-daily multiple 
doses in multiple myeloma patients have been studied without reported serious adverse reactions 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related to overdose. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. In studies, pomalidomide was 
found to be removed by haemodialysis. 
In the event of overdose, supportive care is advised.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX06 
Mechanism of action 
Pomalidomide has direct anti-myeloma tumoricidal activity, immunomodulatory activities and inhibits 
stromal cell support for multiple myeloma tumour cell growth. Specifically, pomalidomide inhibits 
proliferation and induces apoptosis of haematopoietic tumour cells. Additionally, pomalidomide 
inhibits the proliferation of lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines and synergises with 
dexamethasone in both lenalidomide-sensitive and lenalidomide-resistant cell lines to induce tumour 
cell apoptosis. Pomalidomide enhances T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and 
inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. 
Pomalidomide also inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells. 
Pomalidomide binds directly to the protein cereblon (CRBN), which is part of an E3 ligase complex 
that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4), and 
regulator of cullins-1 (Roc1), and can inhibit the auto-ubiquitination of CRBN within the complex. E3 
ubiquitin ligases are responsible for the poly-ubiquitination of a variety of substrate proteins, and may 
partially explain the pleiotropic cellular effects observed with pomalidomide treatment. 
In the presence of pomalidomide in vitro, substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros are targeted for 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. 
In vivo, pomalidomide therapy led to reduction in the levels of Ikaros in patients with relapsed 
lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
The efficacy and safety of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and low-dose 
dexamethasone (Pom+Btz+LD-Dex) was compared with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone 
(Btz+LD-Dex) in a Phase III multi-centre, randomised, open-label study (CC-4047-MM-007), in 
previously treated adult patients with multiple myeloma, who had received at least one prior regimen, 
including lenalidomide and have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. A total 
of 559 patients were enrolled and randomised in the study: 281 in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm and 278 
in the Btz+LD-Dex arm. 54% of patients were male with median age for the overall population of 68 
years (min, max: 27, 89 years). Approximately 70% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide 
(71.2% in Pom+Btz+LD-Dex, 68.7 % in Btz+LD-Dex). Approximately 40% of patients were in 1st 
relapse and approximately 73% of patients received bortezomib as prior treatment. 
Patients in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide orally on Days 1 to 14 
of each 21-day cycle. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/dose) was administered to patients in both study arms on 
Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles 1 to 8; and on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for 
Cycles 9 and onwards. Low-dose dexamethasone (20 mg/day [≤ 75 years old] or 10 mg/day [> 75 
years old]) was administered to patients in both study arms on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of a 21-
day cycle for Cycles 1 to 8; and on Days 1, 2, 8 and 9 of each subsequent 21-day cycle from Cycles 9 
onwards. Doses were reduced and treatment was temporarily interrupted or stopped as needed to 
manage toxicity (see section 4.2).

The primary efficacy endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by an Independent 
Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) according to the IMWG criteria using the intent to treat 
population (ITT). After a median follow-up of 15.9 months, median PFS time was 11.20 months (95% 
CI: 9.66, 13.73) in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm. In the Btz+LD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 7.1 
months (95% CI: 5.88, 8.48).  
Summary of overall efficacy data are presented in Table 8 using a cut-off date of 26 Oct 2017.

Final analysis for Overall Survival (OS), using a cut-off of 13 May 2022 (median follow-up period of 
64.5 months), median OS time from Kaplan-Meier estimates was 35.6 months for the Pom + Btz + 
LD-Dex arm and 31.6 months for the Btz + LD-Dex arm; HR =0.94, 95% CI: -0.77, 1.15, with an 
overall event rate of 70.0%. The OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies 
received. 
Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
The efficacy and safety of pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were evaluated in a 
Phase III multi-centre, randomised, open-label study (CC-4047-MM-003), where pomalidomide plus 
low-dose dexamethasone therapy (Pom+LD-Dex) was compared to high-dose dexamethasone alone 
(HD-Dex) in previously treated adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who 
have received at least two prior treatment regimens, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. A total of 455 patients were enrolled in the 
study: 302 in the Pom+LD-Dex arm and 153 in the HD-Dex arm. The majority of patients were male 
(59%) and white (79%); the median age for the overall population was 64 years (min, max: 35, 87 
years). 
Patients in the Pom+LD-Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide orally on days 1 to 21 of 
each 28-day cycle. LD-Dex (40 mg) was administered once per day on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-
day cycle. For the HD-Dex arm, dexamethasone (40 mg) was administered once per day on days 1 
through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 of a 28-day cycle. Patients > 75 years of age started 
treatment with 20 mg dexamethasone. Treatment continued until patients had disease progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival by International Myeloma Working 
Group (IMWG criteria). For the intention to treat (ITT) population, median PFS time by Independent 
Review Adjudication Committee (IRAC) review based on IMWG criteria was 15.7 weeks (95% CI: 
13.0, 20.1) in the Pom + LD-Dex arm; the estimated 26-week event-free survival rate was 35.99% 
(±3.46%). In the HD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.0, 9.0); the estimated 26-
week event-free survival rate was 12.15% (±3.63%). 
PFS was evaluated in several relevant subgroups: gender, race, ECOG performance status, 
stratification factors (age, disease population, prior anti-myeloma therapies [2, > 2]), selected 
parameters of prognostic significance (baseline beta-2 microglobulin level, baseline albumin levels, 
baseline renal impairment, and cytogenetic risk), and exposure and refractoriness to prior anti-
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
myeloma therapies. Regardless of the subgroup evaluated, PFS was generally consistent with that 
observed in the ITT population for both treatment groups. 
PFS is summarised in Table 9 for the ITT population. Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS for the ITT 
population is provided in Figure 2.

Overall Survival was the key secondary study endpoint. A total of 226 (74.8%) of the Pom + LD-Dex 
patients and 95 (62.1%) of the HD-Dex patients were alive as of the cutoff date (07 Sep 2012). Median 
OS time from Kaplan-Meier estimates has not been reached for the Pom + LD-Dex, but would be 
expected to be at least 48 weeks, which is the lower boundary of the 95% CI. Median OS time for the 
HD-Dex arm was 34 weeks (95% CI: 23.4, 39.9). The 1-year event free rate was 52.6% (± 5.72%) for 
the Pom + LD-Dex arm and 28.4% (± 7.51%) for the HD-Dex arm. The difference in OS between the 
two treatment arms was statistically significant (p < 0.001). 
Overall survival is summarised in Table 10 for the ITT population. Kaplan-Meier curve for OS for the 
ITT population is provided in Figure 3. 
Based on the results of both PFS and OS endpoints, the Data Monitoring Committee established for 
this study recommended that the study be completed and patients in the HD-Dex arm be crossed over 
to the Pom + LD-Dex arm.

Overall Survival (week)

Paediatric population  
In a Phase 1 single-arm, open-label, dose escalation study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or 
recommended Phase2 dose (RP2D) of pomalidomide in paediatric patients was determined to be 2.6 
mg/m2/day administered orally on Day 1 to Day 21 of a repeated 28-day cycle.  
Efficacy was not demonstrated in a Phase 2 multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group study conducted 
in 52 pomalidomide-treated paediatric patients, aged 4 to 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-
grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with primary 
location in the central nervous system (CNS). 
In the Phase 2 study, two patients in the high-grade glioma group (N=19) achieved a response as 
defined by protocol; one of these patients achieved a partial response (PR) and the other patient 
achieved a long term stable disease (SD), which resulted in an objective response (OR) and long-term 
SD rate of 10.5% (95% CI: 1.3, 33.1). One patient in the ependymoma group (N=9) achieved a long-
term SD which resulted in an OR and long-term SD rate of 11.1% (95% CI: 0.3, 48.2). No confirmed 
OR or long-term SD was observed in any of the evaluable patients in either the diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma (DIPG) group (N=9) or medulloblastoma group (N=9). None of the 4 parallel groups 
assessed in this Phase 2 study met the primary endpoint of objective response or long-term stable 
disease rate. 
The overall safety profile of pomalidomide in paediatric patients was consistent with the known safety 
profile in adults. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in an Integrated PK Analysis of the 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and were found to have no significant difference to those observed in 
adult patients (see section 5.2).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Pomalidomide is absorbed with a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) occurring between 2 and 
3 hours and is at least 73% absorbed following administration of single oral dose. The systemic 
exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide increases in an approximately linear and dose proportional manner. 
Following multiple doses, pomalidomide has an accumulation ratio of 27 to 31% on AUC. 
Coadministration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal slows the rate of absorption, decreasing mean 
plasma Cmax by approximately 27%, but has minimal effect on the overall extent of absorption with an 
8% decrease in mean AUC. Therefore, pomalidomide can be administered without regard to food 
intake. 
Distribution 
Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at steady 
state. Pomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 
67% of plasma level at 4 hours post-dose (approximately Tmax) after 4 days of once daily dosing at 
2 mg. In vitro binding of pomalidomide enantiomers to proteins in human plasma ranges from 12% to 
44% and is not concentration dependent. 
Biotransformation 
Pomalidomide is the major circulating component (approximately 70% of plasma radioactivity) in vivo 
in healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of [14C]-pomalidomide (2 mg). No metabolites 
were present at >10% relative to parent or total radioactivity in plasma. 
The predominant metabolic pathways of excreted radioactivity are hydroxylation with subsequent 
glucuronidation, or hydrolysis. In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the primary 
enzymes involved in the CYP-mediated hydroxylation of pomalidomide, with additional minor 
contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Pomalidomide is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein in 
vitro. Co-administration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, 
or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to 
pomalidomide. Co-administration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide in 
the presence of ketoconazole, increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 107% with a 90% 
confidence interval [91% to 124%] compared to pomalidomide plus ketoconazole. In a second study to 
evaluate the contribution of a CYP1A2 inhibitor alone to metabolism changes, co-administration of 
fluvoxamine alone with pomalidomide increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 125% with a 
90% confidence interval [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong inhibitors of 
CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and fluvoxamine) are co-administered with pomalidomide, 
reduce the dose of pomalidomide to 50%. Administration of pomalidomide in smokers, with smoking 
tobacco known to induce the CYP1A2 isoform, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to 
pomalidomide compared to that exposure to pomalidomide observed in non-smokers. 
Based on in vitro data, pomalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, 
and does not inhibit any drug transporters that were studied. Clinically relevant interactions are not 
anticipated when pomalidomide is coadministered with substrates of these pathways. 
Elimination 
Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half-life of approximately 9.5 hours in healthy 
subjects and approximately 7.5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma. Pomalidomide has a mean 
total body clearance (CL/F) of approximately 7-10 L/hr. 
Following a single oral administration of [14C] -pomalidomide (2 mg) to healthy subjects, 
approximately 73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and faeces, respectively, 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with approximately 2% and 8% of the dosed radiocarbon eliminated as pomalidomide in urine and 
faeces. 
Pomalidomide is extensively metabolised prior to excretion, with the resulting metabolites eliminated 
primarily in the urine. The 3 predominant metabolites in urine (formed via hydrolysis or hydroxylation 
with subsequent glucuronidation) account for approximately 23%, 17%, and 12%, respectively, of the 
dose in the urine. 
CYP dependent metabolites account for approximately 43% of the total excreted radioactivity, while 
non-CYP dependent hydrolytic metabolites account for 25%, and excretion of unchanged 
pomalidomide accounted for 10% (2% in urine and 8% in faeces). 
Population Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Based on population PK analysis using a two-compartment model, healthy subjects and MM patients 
had comparable apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F). In 
peripheral tissues, pomalidomide was preferentially taken up by tumours with apparent peripheral 
distribution clearance (Q/F) and apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F) 3.7-fold and 8-fold 
higher, respectively, than that of healthy subjects. 
Paediatric population 
 Following a single oral dose of pomalidomide in children and young adults with recurrent or 
progressive primary brain tumour, the median Tmax was 2 to 4 hours post-dose and corresponded to 
geometric mean Cmax (CV%) values of 74.8 (59.4%), 79.2 (51.7%), and 104 (18.3%) ng/mL at the 1.9, 
2.6, and 3.4 mg/m2 dose levels, respectively. AUC0-24 and AUC0-inf followed similar trends, with total 
exposure in the range of approximately 700 to 800 h·ng/mL at the lower 2 doses, and approximately 
1200 h·ng/mL at the high dose. Estimates of half-life were in the range of approximately 5 to 7 hours. 
There were no clear trends attributable to stratification by age and steroid use at the MTD. 
Overall, data suggest that AUC increased nearly proportional to the increase in pomalidomide dose, 
while the increase in Cmax was generally less than proportional. 
The pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide following oral administration dose levels of 1.9 mg/m2/day to 
3.4 mg/m2/day were determined in 70 patients with ages from 4 to 20 years in an integrated analysis of 
a Phase 1 and Phase 2 study in recurrent or progressive paediatric brain tumours. Pomalidomide 
concentration-time profiles were adequately described with a one compartment PK model with first-
order absorption and elimination. Pomalidomide exhibited linear and time-invariant PK with moderate 
variability. The typical values of CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, lag time of pomalidomide were 3.94 L/h, 43.0 L, 
1.45 h-1 and 0.454 h respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of pomalidomide was 7.33 hours. 
Except for body surface area (BSA), none of the tested covariates including age and sex had effect on 
pomalidomide PK. Although BSA was identified as a statistically significant covariate of 
pomalidomide CL/F and Vc/F, the impact of BSA on exposure parameters was not deemed clinically 
relevant. 
In general, there is no significant difference of pomalidomide PK between children and adult patients. 
Elderly 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses in healthy subjects and multiple myeloma patients, no 
significant influence of age (19-83 years) on oral clearance of pomalidomide was observed. In clinical 
studies, no dose adjustment was required in elderly (> 65 years) patients exposed to pomalidomide 
(see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were 
not remarkably affected in renally impaired patients (defined by creatinine clearance or estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) compared to patients with normal renal function 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(CrCl ≥60 mL/minute). Mean normalised AUC exposure to pomalidomide was 98.2% with a 
90% confidence interval [77.4% to 120.6%] in moderate renal impairment patients (eGFR ≥30 to 
≤45 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to patients with normal renal function. Mean normalised AUC 
exposure to pomalidomide was 100.2% with a 90% confidence interval [79.7% to 127.0%] in severe 
renal impairment patients not requiring dialysis (CrCl <30 or eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) 
compared to patients with normal renal function. Mean normalised AUC exposure to pomalidomide 
increased by 35.8% with a 90% CI [7.5% to 70.0%] in severe renal impairment patients requiring 
dialysis (CrCl <30mL/minute requiring dialysis) compared to patients with normal renal function. The 
mean changes in exposure to pomalidomide in each of these renal impairment groups are not of a 
magnitude that requires dose adjustments.  
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were modestly changed in hepatically impaired patients (defined by 
Child-Pugh criteria) compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide increased by 51% 
with a 90% confidence interval [9% to 110%] in mildly hepatically impaired patients compared to 
healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide increased by 58% with a 90% confidence interval 
[13% to 119%] in moderately hepatically impaired patients compared to healthy subjects. Mean 
exposure to pomalidomide increased by 72% with a 90% confidence interval [24% to 138%] in 
severely hepatically impaired patients compared to healthy subjects. The mean increases in exposure 
to pomalidomide in each of these impairment groups are not of a magnitude for which adjustments in 
schedule or dose are required (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat-dose toxicology studies 
In rats, chronic administration of pomalidomide at doses of 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day for 6 months 
was well tolerated. No adverse findings were noted up to 1000 mg/kg/day (175-fold exposure ratio 
relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).  
In monkeys, pomalidomide was evaluated in repeat-dose studies of up to 9 months in duration. In 
these studies, monkeys exhibited greater sensitivity to pomalidomide effects than rats. The primary 
toxicities observed in monkeys were associated with the haematopoietic/lymphoreticular systems. In 
the 9-month study in monkeys with doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/day, morbidity and early 
euthanasia of 6 animals were observed at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were attributed to 
immunosuppressive effects (staphylococcal infection, decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, 
chronic inflammation of the large intestine, histologic lymphoid depletion, and hypocellularity of bone 
marrow) at high exposures of pomalidomide (15-fold exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). 
These immunosuppressive effects resulted in early euthanasia of 4 monkeys due to poor health 
condition (watery stool, inappetence, reduced food intake, and weight loss); histopathologic evaluation 
of these animals showed chronic inflammation of the large intestine and villous atrophy of the small 
intestine. Staphylococcal infection was observed in 4 monkeys; 3 of these animals responded to 
antibiotic treatment and 1 died without treatment. In addition, findings consistent with acute 
myelogenous leukemia led to euthanasia of 1 monkey; clinical observations and clinical pathology 
and/or bone marrow alterations observed in this animal were consistent with immunosuppression. 
Minimal or mild bile duct proliferation with associated increases in ALP and GGT were also observed 
at 1 mg/kg/day. Evaluation of recovery animals indicated that all treatment-related findings were 
reversible after 8 weeks of dosing cessation, except for proliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts 
observed in 1 animal in the 1 mg/kg/day group. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) 
was 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.5-fold exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
Pomalidomide was not mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian mutation assays, and did not induce 
chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or micronuclei formation in 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of rats administered doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, pomalidomide was administered to males 
and females at doses of 25, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. Uterine examination on Gestation Day 13 
showed a decrease in mean number of viable embryos and an increase in postimplantation loss at all 
dose levels. Therefore, the NOAEL for these observed effects was < 25 mg/kg/day (AUC 24h was 
39960 ng•h/mL (nanogram•hour/millilitres) at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 99-
fold relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). When treated males on this study were mated with untreated 
females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls. Based on these results, the observed 
effects were attributed to the treatment of females. 
Embryo-foetal development  
Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the 
period of major organogenesis. In the rat embryofoetal developmental toxicity study, malformations of 
absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and 
thoracic vertebral elements (central and/or neural arches) were observed at all dose levels (25, 250, 
and 1000 mg/kg/day).  
There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study. Therefore, the maternal NOAEL was 
1000 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was < 25 mg/kg/day (AUC24h was 
34340 ng•h/mL on Gestation Day 17 at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 85-fold 
relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). In rabbits, pomalidomide at doses ranging from 10 to 250 mg/kg 
produced embryo-foetal developmental malformations. Increased cardiac anomalies were seen at all 
doses with significant increases at 250 mg/kg/day. At 100 and 250 mg/kg/day, there were slight 
increases in post-implantation loss and slight decreases in fetal body weights. At 250 mg/kg/day, fetal 
malformations included limb anomalies (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs, unattached or 
absent digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and 
metacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia); moderate dilation of 
the lateral ventricle in the brain; abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery; absent 
intermediate lobe in the lungs; low-set kidney; altered liver morphology; incompletely or not ossified 
pelvis; an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. 
Slight reduction in maternal body weight gain, significant reduction in triglycerides, and significant 
decrease in absolute and relative spleen weights were observed at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The 
maternal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was <10 mg/kg/day (AUC24h 
was 418 ng•h/mL on Gestation Day 19 at this lowest dose tested, which was similar to that obtained 
from a 4 mg clinical dose).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Imnovid is and what it is used for 
What Imnovid is 
Imnovid contains the active substance ‘pomalidomide’. This medicine is related to thalidomide and 
belongs to a group of medicines which affect the immune system (the body’s natural defences). 
What Imnovid is used for 
Imnovid is used to treat adults with a type of cancer called ‘multiple myeloma’. 
Imnovid is either used with: 
• 
two other medicines - called ‘bortezomib’ (a type of chemotherapy medicine) and 
‘dexamethasone’ (an anti-inflammatory medicine) in people who have had at least one other 
treatment - including lenalidomide.  
Or 
• 
 one other medicine - called ‘dexamethasone’ in people whose myeloma has become worse, 
despite having at least two other treatments - including lenalidomide and bortezomib. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell (called the 
‘plasma cell’). These cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow. This results in 
damage to the bones and kidneys. 
Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, treatment can reduce the signs and symptoms 
of the disease, or make them disappear for a period of time. When this happens, it is called ‘response’. 
How Imnovid works 
Imnovid works in a number of different ways: 
• 
• 
• 
by stopping the myeloma cells developing 
by stimulating the immune system to attack the cancer cells 
by stopping the formation of blood vessels supplying the cancer cells. 
The benefit of using Imnovid with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
When Imnovid is used with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in people who have had at least one other 
treatment, it can stop multiple myeloma getting worse: 
•  On average, Imnovid when used with bortezomib and dexamethasone stopped multiple 
myeloma from coming back for up to 11 months - compared with 7 months for those patients 
who only used bortezomib and dexamethasone. 
The benefit of using Imnovid with dexamethasone  
When Imnovid is used with dexamethasone, in people who have had at least two other treatments, it 
can stop multiple myeloma getting worse: 
• 
On average, Imnovid when used with dexamethasone stopped multiple myeloma from coming 
back for up to 4 months - compared with 2 months for those patients who used only 
dexamethasone. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Imnovid 
Do not take Imnovid: 
• 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant – this is 
because Imnovid is expected to be harmful to an unborn child. (Men and women taking this 
medicine must read the section “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for 
women and men” below). 
if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you 
from becoming pregnant (see “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for 
women and men”). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each 
prescription that the necessary measures have been taken and will provide you with this 
confirmation. 
if you are allergic to pomalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
If you are uncertain whether any of the conditions above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse before taking Imnovid. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if: 
• 
you have ever had blood clots in the past. During the treatment with Imnovid you have an 
increased risk of getting blood clots in your veins and arteries. Your doctor may recommend 
you take additional treatments (e.g. warfarin) or lower the dose of Imnovid to reduce the chance 
that you get blood clots.  
you have ever had an allergic reaction such as rash, itching, swelling, feeling dizzy or trouble 
breathing while taking related medicines called ‘thalidomide’ or ‘lenalidomide’. 
• 
• 
• 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have had a heart attack, have heart failure, have difficulty breathing, or if you smoke, have 
high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. 
you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your bone marrow. This 
could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals 
in the blood which can lead to kidney failure. You may also experience an uneven heartbeat. 
This condition is called tumour lysis syndrome. 
you have or have had neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling or pain in your hands or feet). 
you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Treatment with Imnovid may cause the 
hepatitis B virus to become active again in patients who carry the virus, resulting in a recurrence 
of the infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. 
you experience or have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following 
symptoms: rash on face or extended rash, red skin, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged 
lymph nodes (signs of severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) or drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
(TEN) or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). See also section 4 “Possible side effects”).  
It is important to note that patients with multiple myeloma treated with pomalidomide may develop 
additional types of cancer, therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the benefit and risk when 
you are prescribed this medicine. 
At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: experience 
blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with Imnovid, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. 
At the end of the treatment you should return all unused capsules to the pharmacist. 
Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for women and men 
The following must be followed as stated in the Imnovid Pregnancy Prevention Programme. 
Women and men taking Imnovid must not become pregnant or father a child. This is because 
pomalidomide is expected to harm the unborn baby. You and your partner should use effective 
methods of contraception while taking this medicine. 
Women 
Do not take Imnovid if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become 
pregnant. This is because this medicine is expected to harm the unborn baby. Before starting the 
treatment, you should tell your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think this is 
unlikely. 
If you are able to become pregnant: 
• 
you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, 
for the whole time you are taking treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. 
Talk to your doctor about the best method of contraception for you. 
each time your doctor writes a prescription for you, he will ensure you understand the necessary 
measures that have to be taken to prevent pregnancy. 
your doctor will arrange pregnancy tests before treatment, at least every 4 weeks during 
treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished. 
• 
• 
If you become pregnant despite the prevention measures: 
• 
you must stop the treatment immediately and talk to your doctor straight away. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Imnovid passes into human breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or 
intend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you should stop or continue breast-feeding. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Men 
Imnovid passes into human semen. 
• 
• 
If your partner is pregnant or able to become pregnant, you must use condoms for the whole 
time you are taking treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. 
If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking Imnovid, tell your doctor straight away. 
Your partner should also tell her doctor straight away. 
You should not donate semen or sperm during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. 
Blood donation and blood tests 
You should not donate blood during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. 
Before and during the treatment with Imnovid you will have regular blood tests. This is because your 
medicine may cause a fall in the number of blood cells that help fight infection (white cells) and in the 
number of cells that help to stop bleeding (platelets). 
Your doctor should ask you to have a blood test: 
• 
• 
• 
before treatment 
every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment 
at least every month after that for as long as you are taking Imnovid. 
As a result of these tests, your doctor may change your dose of Imnovid or stop your treatment. The 
doctor may also change the dose or stop the medicine because of your general health. 
Children and adolescents  
Imnovid is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years. 
Other medicines and Imnovid 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Imnovid can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Imnovid works. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if you are taking any of the 
following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
some antifungals such as ketaconazole 
some antibiotics (for example ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) 
certain antidepressants such as fluvoxamine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some people feel tired, dizzy, faint, confused or less alert when taking Imnovid. If this happens to you, 
do not drive or operate tools or machinery. 
Imnovid contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Imnovid 
Imnovid must be given to you by a doctor with experience in treating multiple myeloma. 
Always take your medicines exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse if you are not sure.

pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule. 
Swallow the capsules whole, preferably with water. 
You can take the capsules either with or without food. 
Take your capsules at about the same time each day.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious side effects 
Stop taking Imnovid and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious 
side effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fever, chills, sore throat, cough, mouth ulcers or any other signs of infection (due to less white 
blood cells, which fight infection).  
Bleeding or bruising without a cause, including nosebleeds and bleeding from the bowels or 
stomach (due to effects on blood cells called ‘platelets’). 
Rapid breathing, rapid pulse, fever and chills, passing very little to no urine, nausea and 
vomiting, confusion, unconsciousness (due to infection of blood called sepsis or septic shock). 
Severe, persistent or bloody diarrhoea (possibly with stomach pain or fever) caused by bacteria 
called Clostridium difficile. 
Chest pain, or leg pain and swelling, especially in your lower leg or calves (caused by blood 
clots). 
Shortness of breath (from serious chest infection, inflammation of the lung, heart failure or 
blood clot). 
Swelling of face, lips, tongue and throat, which may cause difficulty breathing (due to serious 
types of allergic reaction called angioedema and anaphylactic reaction).

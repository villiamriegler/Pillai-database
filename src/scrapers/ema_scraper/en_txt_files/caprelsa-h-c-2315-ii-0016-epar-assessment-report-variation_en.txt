2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement  
About the disease  
Aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in children and adolescents with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.  
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) is a rare, calcitonin (CTN)-producing tumour that arises from the 
parafollicular cells (C-cells) of the thyroid. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 
locally advanced and metastatic tumours are classified under Stage III-Stage IVA-IVB, and Stage IVC 
(M1 – distant metastasis present) respectively. 
The terms “symptomatic and aggressive” disease correspond to a rapid deterioration of clinical condition 
(clinical, biological and radiological signs) i.e., patients at urgent need of treatment. 
Carcinoma  of  the  thyroid  is  the  most  common  malignancy  of  the  endocrine  system  and  includes  mostly 
(85%–95%) well-differentiated tumors (papillary or follicular). About 2.5% to 10% of thyroid cancers are 
medullary carcinoma and other are anaplastic.  
The  incidence  rates  of  medullary  thyroid  cancer  (MTC)  is  0.11  per  100  000  person-years  with  no  noted 
substantial differences by race/ethnicity and sex, respectively (ESMO Guideline). MTC presents mainly as 
a  sporadic  cancer  (70-75%  of  cases)  or  as  part  of  a  hereditary  syndrome  (25-30%).  The  age-adjusted 
death  rate  was  0.5  per  100  000  men  and  women  per  year  in  the  US  (Howlader  N  et  al.  Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results registry of the National Cancer  Institute (SEER) Cancer  Statistics Review 
1975–2008).  
Hereditary  MTC  is  divided  into  3  distinct  clinical  subtypes.  Multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  (MEN)  2A,  or 
Sipple’s syndrome, is the most common subtype, accounting for approximately 70% to 80% of patients 
with  hereditary  MTC.  MEN  2B  is  less  common  than  MEN  2A,  accounting  for  approximately  5%  of  MTC 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 7/61 
 
  
  
 
 
cases.  Familial  MTC  is  the  third  clinical  subtype  of  inherited  MTC.  It  accounts  for  10%  to  20%  of 
hereditary MTC cases. 
Paediatric thyroid cancer is rare, and among these cases, medullary thyroid cancer is even rarer, making 
up  about  5%  of  paediatric  thyroid  cancer  cases  (Gerber  et  al  2015,  Hogan  et  al  2009).  Based  on  data 
from  the  SEER  collected  between  1975  and  2012  within  the  broad  age  range  of  zero  to  20  years,  the 
incidence of thyroid cancer has been slowly increasing over a number of years for unknown reasons, with 
a more marked apparent increase within the past decade. If the current incidence of all types of thyroid 
cancer  in  this  age  range  is  taken  as  approximately  1.0  per  100  000  persons  at  risk,  and  if  medullary 
thyroid cancer makes up 5% of those cases, the incidence of medullary thyroid cancer is currently about 
0.05 per 100 000 persons at risk. The sporadic form of MTC generally occurs mainly in adults with a very 
low  incidence  in  children.  Many  paediatric  cases  of  MTC  arise  from  new,  sporadic  germline  mutations  in 
the  RET  gene  and  children  also  present  in  the  context  of  a  history  of  RET-mutation-dependent  familial 
cancers, such as those seen in the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (Waguespack, 2011). 
All familial forms of MTC and MEN 2 are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Mutations in the RET 
proto-oncogene  are  found  in  at  least  95%  of  kindreds  with  MEN  2A  and  88%  of  familial  MTC  (NCCN 
Guideline, 2016). RET was also found to be mutated in some tumours of patients with sporadic MTC, and 
patients with RET mutations (especially the common M918T mutation). 
Patients with MTC often have localization to the neck and mediastinum. Main symptoms are mostly 
diarrhoea, pain, fatigue, respiratory symptoms, flushing, weight loss and dysphagia. Metastatic MTC 
spreads most often to the regional lymphatics as well as to the liver, lungs, and bones. Metastases can be 
anticipated by increasing levels of calcitonin and are often evident on radiographic imaging studies.   
Patients with MEN 2A typically present with a thyroid nodule or neck mass by 15 to 20 years of age but 
MTC can appear as early as 5 years of age (Eng et al 1996, Brandi et al 2001, Kouvaraki et al 2005). MEN 
2B is characterised by a clinically more aggressive form of MTC that is manifest at a younger age (second 
decade) and can be detected in children as young as 1 year of age. Familial MTC is less aggressive and 
has an older age at onset, usually between 20 and 40 years of age, compared to MEN 2A and 2B 
(Farndon et al 1986, Eng 1999). The sporadic form of MTC most often presents in middle-aged patients 
as a solitary nodule in the thyroid.   
Hogan  et  al  worked  with  the  SEER  database  (1973  to  2004)  to  summarize  1753  cases  of  paediatric 
thyroid cancer. The authors report that patients with medullary thyroid cancer had a 96% 5-year survival, 
and an 86% 15-year as well as 30-year survival (Hogan et al 2009).  
The tumour is relatively unresponsive to conventional doses of radiation therapy and standard or novel 
chemotherapeutic regimens (Wu et al 1994, Di Bartolomeo et al 1995, Marsh et al 1995, Modigliani et al 
1998, Kebebew et al 2000, Nocera et al 2000, Brandi et al 2001, Quayle and Moley 2005). Surgery is the 
only standard treatment and patients with MTC can only be cured by thyroidectomy, but only if the 
tumour has remained confined to the thyroid gland. Early recognition through genetic screening and 
detection of one of the characteristic mutations, followed by prophylactic thyroidectomy, has become the 
standard of care (Wells and Skinner 1998, Peczkowska et al 2005). 
The treatment practices for children with MTC are identical to those for adults. Chemotherapy has not 
been shown to have a benefit in children with MTC, and there is currently no standard treatment for 
children who have metastatic or unresectable disease.  
About the product 
Caprelsa (Vandetanib) is a small molecule belonging to the class of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
inhibitors that potently inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 (VEGFR-2 also 
known as kinase insert domain containing receptor [KDR]), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 8/61 
 
  
  
RET tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib is also a sub-micromolar inhibitor of vascular endothelial receptor-3 
tyrosine kinase. 
Caprelsa was granted EU approval on the 17th of February 2012 for the treatment of aggressive and 
symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic disease. 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication to include the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC) in paediatric patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
The proposed indication for Caprelsa in the paediatric population is as follows: 
“Caprelsa is indicated for the treatment of children ages 5 to 18 years of age with unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).” 
The final agreed indication is as follows:  
“Caprelsa is indicated for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
Caprelsa is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 5 years and older. 
For patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, a 
possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important 
information in sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has previously been submitted as part of the initial MA 
application. Due to the low percentage (1.8%) of new cases of thyroid cancer for patients below 20 years 
old reported in the US SEER between 2008 and 2012 a significant increase in the environmental exposure 
is not anticipated. Therefore, a revised ERA for vandetanib was not provided by the MAH. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The justification provided for the lack of ERA studies is considered acceptable. 
Non-clinical study reports for one month and six month oral toxicity studies in rats and one month toxicity 
study in dogs had previously been provided. These study reports showed that daily dosing of vandetanib 
for 1 month resulted in a dose-related dysplasia of the epiphysial growth plates of the femoro-tibial joint 
in rats and in the femur of dogs, and that these changes were reversible following a 4-week recovery 
period. The dysplasia is considered to be a consequence of VEGF receptor inhibition (see SmPC section 
5.3). Paediatric adverse event reports will be closely monitored and specific adverse drug reaction form 
will be provided to the health care professional to solicit information specific to growth, bone and teeth 
development in the patient (see Clinical safety and RMP).

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support the use of vandetanib in paediatric patients, the MAH has provided data from an NCI-
sponsored study (Study IRUSZACT0098; Study 98; IS-Study 98) and from three investigator-sponsored 
studies in different indications (see below). Furthermore, PK data from the pivotal study in adults with 
MTC (Study 58]) were also provided. 
IRUSZACT0098 (Study 98): A dose-finding, intra-patient dose-escalation, non-controlled, single-
arm, single-agent, open-label, single-institution trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and 
activity of vandetanib in children from 5 years to less than 18 years of age with unresectable, 
recurrent or metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma

GCP 
The main study IRUSZACT0098 (Study 98) was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the 
applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics data are available from study 98. Two paediatric studies in glioma-related indications 
(ISSZACT0004 [Study 04], and IRUSZACT0051 [Study 51]) provide additional pharmacokinetic data in 
paediatric patients. In all paediatric patients, vandetanib was dosed was on the basis of their Body 
Surface Area (BSA).

Study IRUSZACT0098 (study 98) 
Method 
Details on the Method are presented under ‘clinical efficacy’. 
The primary PK Objective was to assess the PK of vandetanib at steady state (end of Cycle 2; a cycle was 
defined to facilitate study assessments as 28 days, although vandetanib was dosed continuously 
throughout each treatment cycle) in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC. 
PK data were collected in Cycle 2 (Day 28) and Cycle 3 (Day 1), and trough concentrations at cycle 1 day 
2, predose cycle 4 and 5.  
Starting dose of vandetanib in paediatric patients with MTC was 100 mg/m2 with the option to increase 
the dose to 150 mg/m2 after 8 weeks. 
Results 
Sixteen patients were enrolled and received treatment with vandetanib. The initial dose was 100 
mg/m2/day for 15 patients and 150 mg/m2/day for 1 patient. Based on a 70 kg /150 cm adult female 
(BSA equivalent to 1.65 m2), doses of 100 mg/m2/day and 150 mg/m2/day are equivalent to 55% and 
82% respectively of the fixed adult daily dose of 300 mg daily. Limited intra-patient dose escalation was 
allowed in the 100 mg/m2/day group (an option to escalate to 150 mg/m2/day 12 after 2 or 3 months 
treatment at 100 mg/m2/day). PK data were only collected in Cycle 2 (Day 28) and Cycle 3 (Day 1), and 
the available PK data could only be analysed for 10 patients, all of whom had received a dose of 100 
mg/m2/day; however, 6 of the 15 patients who started at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day had a later dose 
escalation to 150 mg/m2/day. The one patient who started vandetanib at 150 mg/m2/day remained on 
this dose during the study.  
All 16 patients completed Cycle 1 and 15 patients completed both Cycles 1 and 2; the remaining patient 
did not complete Cycle 2 due to disease progression. The available PK data could only be analysed for 10 
patients, all of whom had received a dose of 100 mg/m2/day. 
Although Study 98 was protocolled to recruit patients aged 5 to 18 years, the actual age range of the 
patients recruited was 9 to 17 years, with a lowest BSA of 0.90 m2. 
The PK analysis included data from plasma samples drawn during Cycle 2, Day 28 and Cycle 3, Day 1, 
using the long-term stability window of 3 years. Based on the limited PK data, no trends in the potential 
effects of age or body weight on vandetanib exposure were observed. The absorption of vandetanib was 
slow and prolonged with a tmax of 6 hours (range: 1 to 24 hours). Steady state levels of vandetanib in 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 11/61 
 
  
  
 
plasma were approached after 2 months of dosing (i.e., Cycle 2, Day 28). There was moderate inter-
patient variability in the PK parameters assessed. 
This patient population received a median of 750.0 days of treatment during the study, which was 
equivalent to a median treatment duration of 24.6 months. The majority of patients were able to 
maintain a dose of 100 mg/m2/day or greater during the study (13 patients [81.3%]). Only 1 patient 
started vandetanib at 150 mg/m2/day. 
There  was  a  moderate  inter-patient  variability  in  exposure  to  vandetanib  with  a  Coefficient  of  variation 
(CV) for AUC0-24 and Cmax of 27.4% and 25.6%, respectively (Table below). The total body clearance of 
drug  from  plasma  (CL/F)  was  relatively  low  with  moderate  inter-patient  variability  (geometric  mean 
[CV%] value of 8.83 L/h [33.7%]). 
Table 2 Summary of PK parameters of 100 mg/m2/day vandetanib at steady-state in paediatric patients 
with MTC (Study 98) 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  in  Study  98,  analyses  of  PK  by  intrinsic  factors  (e.g.,  race,  sex  and 
renal  or  hepatic  impairment)  and  extrinsic  factors  (e.g.,  food,  alcohol  use,  tobacco  use  and  drug:drug 
interactions) have not been performed. Based on the limited PK data available from Study 98, no effect 
on the PK of vandetanib was found for patient’s age or body weight when vandetanib was dosed as 100 
mg/m2 (Figure below).

Comparison vandetanib exposure in paediatric patients and adult patients with MTC 
In  the  paediatric  MTC  study,  Study  98,  the  initial  dose  of  vandetanib  was  100  mg/m2/day.  This  is 
approximately equivalent to 60% of the fixed adult daily dose of 300 mg daily. The average vandetanib 
exposure was 15% lower in paediatric patients dosed 100 mg/m2 compared to adults dosed 300 mg, but 
there is a complete overlap in exposure (Figure 2). Further, no effect on the PK of vandetanib was found 
for  patient’s  age  or  body  weight  in  paediatric  patients  with  MTC  when  vandetanib  was  dosed  as  100 
mg/m2.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
PopPK analysis 
A non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach was used to compare adult PK data (Study 58) to 
paediatric data collected in MTC patients (Study 98). A total of 130 plasma concentrations were available 
for the analysis from Study 98 compared with 1624 samples from Study 58. 
The aim of the analysis was to assess whether the adults and paediatric patients share the same 
population PK model with the same covariate structure. A bayesian approach was employed, which made 
use of the adult Study 58 population parameter estimates and uncertainly in estimate distributions as 
priors. However back-extrapolation of the adult covariate model resulted in an under-prediction of PK 
parameters in paediatric patients. 
PBPK modelling 
In  study  98  no  patients  younger  than  9  years  were  included,  therefore,  PBPK  modeling  was  used  to 
estimate the difference between paediatric patients 5-9 years and 9-17 years of age using data collected 
in Studies 04, 51 and 98. 
A Simcyp model was previously developed to predict adult PK of vandetanib. Observed plasma 
concentration data at 100 mg/m2 dose level from IS-Study 98 was used to compare and evaluate the 
physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) modelling was used to predict exposures in MTC patients 
aged 5 to 9 years PBPK model simulated plasma concentration. Due to limited individual plasma 
concentration data being available from IS-Study 4 and IS-Study 51, these studies were not used for 
comparison in this analysis. Individual plasma clearance values were available from IS-Study 4 and this 
data was used to compare CL values predicted based on PBPK model. 
The PBPK model that described pharmacokinetics in adult population was used to simulate PK in 
paediatric population consisting of 9 to 18 years old. The paediatric module in Simcyp population based

simulator was used to perform these simulations. Plasma concentrations were simulated for 100 mg/m2 
dose level. An allometric scaling option available in Simcyp was used to scale for differences in PK 
parameters (Clearance) between adult and paediatric populations. This simulation was performed in a 
virtual paediatric population in Simcyp consisting of 9 to 18 year olds and the PBPK model structure, 
physiochemical and PK input parameters were retained as for the adult population.

age, with observed concentrations from Study 98. 
The Model developed for paediatric population was used to predict the PK in a population consists of 5 to 
9 years of age. Simulation of PK for 5 to 9 years of age for 100 mg/m2 dose level was performed and the 
simulated plasma concentrations were compared with that of from the group of 9-18 years of age.

Optimised PBPK model 
Additional analyses to optimise the PBPK model were performed. The PBPK model was updated to be 
based on the contribution of respective CYP enzymes to the clearance of vandetanib, whereas the 
previous model used CLoral as input and scaled pharmacokinetics between adult and paediatric 
population using an allometric scaling approach. In addition, minimal PBPK model as implemented in 
Simcyp (version 14) was also optimised by including additional PBPK parameters (Vsac, Kin and Kout). 
These additional PBPK parameters were estimated using the ‘parameter estimation option’ and observed 
plasma concentration data after single dose administration of vandetanib in study 51.

The model predicted plasma concentration at 100 mg/m2 dose level (Figure 6) was compared to the 
observed plasma concentrations from study 98. The predictions based on CYP enzymes appear marginally 
different and there was less over-prediction compared to the predictions based on allometric scaling 
approach.

In addition to comparing study 98 data with predictions, the MAH also used plasma concentration data 
(dose: 110 mg/m2) from study 51 to assess the refined PBPK model for its adequateness. The model 
predicted the steady state plasma concentration at 110 mg/m2 well however appeared to under-predict 
the plasma concentrations after the first (single) dose (Figure 7).

Exploratory PopPK model 
In addition to optimizing PBPK model, an exploratory population PK model was developed using the data 
from paediatric studies 98 and 51. In total, 447 plasma PK samples from 38 paediatric patients treated 
with vandetanib were available for inclusion in this analysis. Two samples from one subject were flagged 
in the analysis dataset by a non-critical error and so these sampled were not included in the analysis. 
Number of samples/subject ranged from 5 to 20, 1 to 12 for Study 51 and Study 98, respectively. 
This population PK analysis was exploratory because the data from study 51 were sourced from an 
investigator sponsored study and the MAH was not able to show traceability of individual plasma 
concentrations, actual time of dose administration and actual time of sample collection data. Individual 
plasma concentration data were not available from study 04, though the secondary PK parameters are 
available from a publication. Despite of these limitations, a two compartment PK model with first order 
absorption rate constant was developed to explain the time course of plasma concentration after multiple 
doses of vandetanib administration in this population. Due to the sparse nature of the data, prior 
information on pharmacokinetic parameters were used from a population PK model developed previously 
to describe PK in adult population. Similar to the PK model used for the adult population, this PK model 
used weight as a covariate to explain the variability in CL/F and V2/F. Age could not be included as a 
covariate and the effect of age on PK parameters could not be explored. This population PK model was 
subjected to a limited evaluation process including a visual predictive check. Due to limited number of 
subjects involved in the analysis, a proper validation of model (bootstrap, other simulation based 
evaluations) was not feasible.  
The PK parameter estimates are presented in the table below.

In Figure 8 and Figure 9, simulated concentrations were compared with observed concentrations. At 
steady-state conditions (Figure 9), the median of predicted data from the PopPK model was slightly lower 
than the observed data. Variability in vandetanib exposure was higher in study 51 on dose/sample 
collection but potential effect of age on pharmacokinetics of vandetanib was not evaluated.

Effect of body weight and age  
The exploratory population PK analysis using data from pediatric studies 51 and 98 evaluated the effect of 
body weight on pharmacokinetics. In an adult population PK modelling (based on study 58) covariate

effect of age, body weight and BSA on pharmacokinetics of vandetanib was evaluated and only body 
weight showed a significant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on this prior information and 
considering the limited number of paediatric subjects, only body weight was considered as a covariate in 
this exploratory population PK modelling for paediatric studies. 
This exploratory population PK model applied body weight as a covariate on clearance and distribution 
parameters. Further, this model was used to simulate PK concentrations after multiple dose 
administration of vandetanib in different regimens for a population consisting of 5 to 18 years of age and 
calculated secondary PK parameters including Area under the Curve steady state (AUCss) at day 60 and 
stratified by discrete BSA ranges. The AUCss predictions obtained from simulations based on the 
population PK analysis were in good agreement with AUCss predictions obtained from the optimised PBPK 
method, see Figure 10.

Based on Figure 11 and Figure 12, dose normalised trough plasma concentrations appeared to be similar 
across different age and body weight groups. For study 98, plasma concentrations were obtained after 
cycle 2 day 28 and/or cycle 3 day 1. Details of pharmacokinetic sampling and dose are provided in 
Broniscer, 2010 and Broniscer, 2013 for Study 51 and Study 4, respectively. In study 04, 51 and 98, 
patients were dosed based on their body surface area and not their age.  
2.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Hereditary  MTC  is  often  caused  by  germline  activating  mutations  in  the  rearranged  during  transfection 
(RET)  proto-oncogene.  Because  the  mutations  to  RET  in  MTC  result  in  constitutively  activated  RET 
tyrosine kinase, this RTK is a potential direct therapeutic target in this disease. 
Vandetanib is a small molecule that potently inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (kinase 
insert  domain  receptor)  tyrosine  kinase  activity,  RET  RTK,  Fms-related  tyrosine  kinase  4  and  epidermal 
growth factor receptor, tyrosine kinases (Carlomagno et al 2002, Wedge et al 2002).  
Because  vandetanib  may  have  particular  benefit  for  those  patients  with  activating  mutations  in  the  RET 
gene, tumour samples were collected to establish the mutational status of the RET gene and to relate this 
to clinical outcome data derived from this study. In total, 15 of the 16 patients in Study 98 (93.8%) had 
the M918T mutation.

Exposure-effect relationships 
There was no apparent relationship between exposures (steady state Cmin) and best response (grouped 
into partial response and stable disease + progressive disease) in paediatric patients with MTC (see 
Figure 13).   
Figure 13 Individual Cmin versus best response in paediatric patients with MTC (N=12, Study 98, 100 
mg/m2/day) 
MTC cells secrete Calcitonin CTN and Carcinoembryonic antigen CEA, and several biogenic amines. CTN 
and CEA levels are associated with tumour burden, and elevated levels are associated with disease 
progression and metastases. Most patients were responders (75%) based on calcitonin (CTN) data and 
half of the patients were responders (50%) based on carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) data. (see also 
clinical efficacy part). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vandetanib is marketed as 100 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets. There is no specific paediatric 
formulation of vandetanib. However, in the clinical paediatric studies, vandetanib was supplied as 
10 mg/ml oral solution and 50 mg and 100 mg tablets. In the original MAA submission, it was shown that 
the relative bioavailability of vandetanib comparing tablets vs. oral solution was 100% (study 30), 
therefore, the pharmacokinetic results obtained with solution are interchangeable with tablets. 
Because of a possible over-estimation, and the use of different formulations, there are some doubts on 
the quality of the initial modelling regarding the 9 to 18 years old patient population. Furthermore, the 
initial PBPK model did not seem to predict the exposure in younger children (5-9 years old) accurately 
enough to allow dose recommendations. The PBPK model was updated based on the contribution of 
respective CYP enzymes to the clearance of vandetanib and includes additional PBPK parameters (Vsac, 
Kin and Kout). Inclusion of CYP enzymes for clearance of vandetanib in the PBPK model resulted in less 
over-prediction compared to the predictions based on allometric scaling approach for study 98. However, 
there still appears some underestimation for paediatric patients in study 51 especially following single 
dose administration (Figure 6). The difference between single dose and steady-state prediction was 
unexpected as vandetanib pharmacokinetics was not time dependent in adults. No documentation on the 
updated factors, covariate distribution and variabilities of the simulation data sets was provided, 
hampering evaluation of the PBPK model. An additional popPK model was provided and seemed to be 
reasonably appropriate. However, there were limitations in the data traceability (in study 51) and 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 25/61 
 
  
  
 
assumptions of a similar structural PK model to which described the PK in adult population. Overall the 
PBPK and popPK model were not considered fully reliable. 
Hence, pharmacokinetics data were mainly available from study IRUSZACT0098 (study 98). Although 
study 98 was initially designed to recruit patients aged 5 to 18 years, the actual age range of the patients 
recruited was 9 to 17 years, with a lowest BSA of 0.90 m2. Therefore, additional data for younger (≥2 
years old) and smaller children were requested by the CHMP. Based on data from studies 04, 51 and 98, 
vandetanib trough concentrations at steady state, normalised by dose, were in general between 500-
1000 ng/ml vandetanib dose, which is comparable to the mean Ctrough concentrations of 750 ng/ml in 
adults with MTC. Ctrough values seem to be fairly similar in children between 5 to 8 years old compared 
to older children, and in children with BSA below 1 m2. Therefore, CHMP did not consider necessary to 
exclude children with a BSA of 0.7-1.0 m2. These PK data support dosing based on BSA in paediatric 
patients.  
Based on the very limited PK data available, no effect on the PK of vandetanib was found for patient age 
or body weight. 
Vandetanib is commercially available as either 100 or 300 mg tablets. The MAH was highly recommended 
to develop an adequate formulation (e.g. 50 mg tablet) for use in the paediatric population. Considering 
the submitted PK data showed a small variability in exposure between the alternate 100-200 mg dosing 
regimen compared to 150 mg QD, an alternate dosing regimen was considered acceptable (see table 
below).   
Due to the long elimination half-life of vandetanib (8-19 days), vandetanib exposure cannot be quickly 
reduced when intervention is needed. Therefore, it is proposed to use the same strategy as was used in 
study 98, start with 100 mg/m2 and increase the dose of vandetanib to 150 mg/m2 when vandetanib is 
tolerated well. Based on this, a dosing schedule based on BSA in mg/m2 is recommended (see table 
below). Considering the age range (5 to 18 years old), the paediatric population was grouped by BSA 0.7 
m2 to <0.9 m2, 0.9 m2 to <1.2 m2, 1.2 m2 to <1.6 m2 and ≥ 1.6 m2. 
Considering the complex dosing regimen and the risk of dose miscalculation and/or error, the MAH has 
provided educational material designed to guide parents to manage the dosing regimen. The MAH will 
also put in place measures to assess the treatment compliance, and measures to minimise medication 
Variation assessment report

errors (see RMP). Pediatric patients treated with Caprelsa and patients’ caregivers must be given the 
dosing guide and be informed on the correct dose to be taken with the initial prescription and each 
subsequent dose adjustment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Data provided by the MAH about palatability and acceptability of tablets dispersed in water have been 
assessed in the initial MA and are acceptable. For children not able to swallow, vandetanib tablets may be 
dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated drinking water. This is considered acceptable as regard to the 
expected rarity of such situation and the possibility to administer via nasogastric route. 
There is no experience with the use of vandetanib in paediatric patients with renal impairment. 
Considering the data available in adult patients with renal impairment: No change in starting dose is 
recommended in paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. The reduced dose as specified in Table 
above could be used in paediatric patients with moderate renal impairment. Individual patient 
management will be required by the physician, especially in paediatric patients with low BSA; Vandetanib 
is not recommended in paediatric patients with severe renal impairment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Vandetanib is not recommended for use in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin 
greater than 1.5 times upper limit of reference range (ULRR), this criterion does not apply to patients 
with Gilbert’s Disease and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) greater than 2.5 times ULRR, or greater than 5.0 times ULRR if judged by the 
physician to be related to liver metastases (see SmPC section 4.2). 
There was no apparent relationship between Cmin and best response in paediatric patients with MTC. The 
number  of  patients  was  small  and  some  of  the  patients  may  have  had  a  dose  escalation  to  150  mg/m2 
but  no  exposure  data  are  available  for  this  higher  dose.  For  adults  with  MTC,  analysis  of  the  best 
observed  response  versus  predicted  steady-state  exposure  suggested  a  better  response  at  higher 
vandetanib  plasma  concentrations:  a  steady-state  AUC  of  21  μg.h/mL  or  greater  was  required  for  the 
predicted  probability  of  partial  response  to  be  50%  or  more  and  a  steady-state  AUC  of  at  least 
7.0 μg.h/mL  for  the  probability  of  stable  disease  to  be  50%  or  more  as  best  response.  Exposure  of 
vandetanib in all paediatric patients was higher than the level for the probability of stable disease to be 
50% or more as best response. Further, response to biomarkers calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen 
was comparable in paediatric patients and in adults with MTC. In adults, CTN and CEA response rate was 
higher after administration of 300 mg vandetanib compared to the response rates after administration of 
100 mg vandetanib. Overall, the starting dose of 100 mg/m2 in paediatric patients with MTC is supported 
by  comparable  vandetanib  exposure  and  comparable  biomarker  responses  compared  to  adult  MTC 
patients  dosed  300  mg.  Exposure  to  vandetanib  and  biomarker  response  was  comparable  in  paediatric 
patients  with  MTC  (age  9-17)  administered  vandetanib  100  mg/m2/day  and  adult  patients  with  MTC 
administered 300 mg qd.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of vandetanib in paediatrics MTC patients aged 9-18 years were similar 
to those in adults. There is no experience in pediatric patients with hereditary MTC below 9 years of age 
(see SmPC section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). Vandetanib exposure in children between 5 to 8 years old with 
glioma-related indications was comparable to MTC patients aged 9-18 years. Dosing at 100 mg/m2/day of 
the indicated posology (function of BSA) in paediatrics delivers similar exposure to that achieved in adults 
at 300 mg daily (see SmPC section 5.2). Educational material and measures to assess compliance and 
minimise medication errors will be put in place by the MAH (see RMP).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was provided. A dose-finding component was included in pivotal study 98. This 
component used an intra-patient dose escalation design to ensure all patients received doses equivalent 
to those used in the adult Phase II studies (see Main study below). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
IRUSZACT0098 (study 98)  
Methods 
Study participants 
The patient population was planned to include male and non-pregnant female patients aged 5 to 18 
years, inclusive, with histologically-confirmed hereditary MTC (multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] 2A or 
MEN 2B) that was unresectable, recurrent or metastatic. 
Patients must have previously had a characteristic germline mutation in the rearranged during 
transfection (RET) proto-oncogene documented.  
Patients were to have had measurable disease and a Lansky (for patients 10 years of age or younger) or 
Karnofsky (for patients older than 10 years) performance score >50. Patients must have been able to 
take one of the oral formulations of vandetanib (administration of the liquid formulation via a nasogastric 
tube or gastrostomy was allowed). Patients who had previously had a thyroidectomy must have been 
receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. 
Treatments 
Study 98 used a 10 mg/mL oral solution formulation of vandetanib, and either 50 mg or 100 mg film-
coated tablets. Patients received vandetanib continuously for cycles of 28 consecutive days starting with 
the first day of treatment (Day 1); there was to be no limit to the duration of therapy. 
Vandetanib was administered orally, once daily, either as a tablet (50 mg and 100 mg tablets), which was 
to be swallowed whole, or an oral solution (10 mg/mL solution); patients could receive the oral solution 
through a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy, if required. Tablets and the oral solution could be combined, 
as needed, to give more accurate dosing. The dose of vandetanib was determined from the patient’s BSA 
using a dosing nomogram (see Table below). The BSA was recalculated prior to each treatment cycle and 
the dose was adjusted, if necessary, based on the nomogram. Treatment was administered in an 
outpatient setting.

Dose escalation was based on toxicity information. 
Figure 14: Flow chart of dose escalation procedure 
There was only 1 treatment group in this study. However, there were cohorts of patients involved in the 
intra-patient dose escalation part of the study. Initially, 3 adolescent patients, aged 13 to 18 years, were 
enrolled and started on the lower dose of vandetanib (100 mg/m2/day) before undergoing dose escalation 
(Cohort 1). Once it was established that the 100 mg/m2/day dose was tolerated, a second cohort of 3 
child patients, aged 5 to 12 years was enrolled at the lower dose and underwent dose escalation (Cohort 
2). From this dose-escalation part of the study, an MTD or recommended dose was defined; the 
remaining patients (15 planned) were to receive this dose from enrolment (Cohort 3).

Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were: 
1. To assess the activity of daily oral vandetanib in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC by 
measuring: 
− Change in tumour size compared to baseline using RECIST (primary endpoint), 
− Change in tumour biomarkers (CTN and CEA) compared to baseline, 
− Change in tumour-related diarrhoea (frequency and consistency), compared to baseline; 
2. To assess the safety and tolerance of vandetanib in children and adolescents at a dose that was 
equivalent to the recommended dose in adults using a limited intra-patient dose escalation; 
3. To assess the PK of vandetanib at steady state (end of Cycle 2) in children and adolescents with 
hereditary MTC. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
1. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in children and adolescents 
with hereditary MTC treated with vandetanib; 
2. To assess the expression of RET, EGFR, VEGFR and somatostatin receptor by immunohistochemistry in 
archival tissue blocks from children and adolescents enrolled on this protocol; 
3. To assess gene expression by microarray prior to and during treatment with vandetanib; 
4. To screen for gains or losses of DNA sequences in tumour tissue using comparative genomic 
hybridisation; 
5. To perform RET gene mutational analysis in tumour and peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to 
treatment and in tumour at the time of disease progression on treatment with vandetanib to discover 
tumour-specific somatic mutations that may be responsible for drug resistance; 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint variable was the Overall Response Rate according to RECIST 1.0 using the 
evaluable for response analysis set. The ORR was defined as the proportion of responders (patients with a 
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) over the course of the study.

•  PR:  At  least  a  30%  decrease  in  the  sum  of  the  longest  diameter  (LD)  of  target  lesions,  taking  as 
reference the baseline sum LD. 
• Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. 
•  Stable  disease:  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to  qualify  for  PR  nor  sufficient  increase  to  qualify  for 
progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions:

•  CR:  Disappearance  of  all  non-target  lesions  and  normalisation  of  tumour  marker  levels.  If  tumour 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response. 
• Stable disease (or incomplete response): Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or maintenance 
of tumour marker level above the normal limits. 
• Progressive disease: Appearance of 1 or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-
target lesions. Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed 
at a later time by the review panel (or PI). 
Response criteria for CEA and CTN were: 
• CR: Normalisation (≤ULN) of CEA or CTN level following treatment, confirmed with a repeated CEA/CTN 
level at least 4 weeks apart. 
• PR: A ≥50% decrease in the CEA or CTN level relative to the baseline level, confirmed with a repeated 
CEA/CTN level at least 4 weeks apart. 
•  Progression:  A  ≥50%  increase  in  the  CEA  or  CTN  relative  to  the  prior  value  on  2  consecutive 
measurements at least 4 weeks apart. The patient must have been taking vandetanib for 4 weeks prior to 
the  first  measurements  and  must  have  continued  to  take  the  drug  during  the  time  that  the  second 
measurement was drawn. 
• Stable: <50% increase or decrease in CTN or CEA level relative to the baseline level. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary outcomes variables were PFS and OS according to RECIST 1.0. 
Sample size 
The preliminary response rate in adults, at the time of CSP finalisation, was 5/18 patients (28%; lower 1-
sided 95% [confidence interval] bound = 10%). This study was designed to determine whether the 
response rate in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC exceeded 10% and was consistent with a 
response rate as high as 30%. With a planned sample size of 21 evaluable patients, using a 1-sided 0.1 
alpha level exact binomial test, the study had 80% power to rule out a 10% response rate in favour of a 
30% response rate. In practice, 5 responses in 21 patients would have marginally ruled out 10% as a 
response rate, and also could be consistent with a response rate of approximately 40%. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable.

This study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
No statistical analysis plan was prepared for this study. Summary statistics of the main primary and 
secondary endpoints were presented by cohort. Listings of the data, by patient, indicating dose and 
cohort were produced. The tumour biopsy data were not available at the data cut-off date for this study. 
No formal statistical analyses were carried out in support of this report. Data were summarised

Results 
Participant flow 
All 16 patients enrolled into the study, received treatment. All 16 patients completed Cycle 1 and 15 
patients completed both Cycles 1 and 2; one patient did not complete Cycle 2 due to disease progression. 
At the time of data cut-off, 4 patients had discontinued treatment due to disease progression, 2 of whom 
were terminated from the study.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and was a single-centre study in the US.  
The first subject was enrolled on 20 July 2007 and data cut-off was 17 July 2011; the study was ongoing 
at the time of data cut-off. 
Conduct of the study 
The original clinical study protocol (CSP) was dated 31 January 2007. There have been 8 CSP 
amendments. In particular, amendment D and E involved personnel changes. With amendment F to the 
consent documentation proteinuria was added as side effect of Caprelsa. Amendment H involved 
personnel and small textual and administrative changes in the protocol and consent documentation. With 
amendment G the eligibility assessment and enrolment was changed.  
There were 5 patients identified as having protocol deviations.

Table 7:  Demography and baseline characteristics 
The mean disease duration (number of years between diagnosis and start of treatment in Cycle 1) was 
3.1 years (range: 0 to 12 years). Most patients (13 patients [81.3%]) had previously undergone a partial 
or total thyroidectomy (prior surgery to the thyroid gland) before entering the study. 
In total, 15 of the 16 patients in this study (93.8%) had the M918T mutation, which is a characteristic of 
the MEN 2B subtype of hereditary MTC (Waguespack et al 2011). 
Numbers analysed 
Patients who were evaluable for ORR were those with measurable disease defined by RECIST at baseline; 
therefore, all patients (N=16) were evaluable. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Objective response 
The majority of patients achieved PR (7 patients [43.8%]) or had stable disease for at least 8 weeks (5 
patients  [31.3%]);  no  patients  showed  CR  (Table  10).  The  ORR  was  43.8%.  The  remaining  4  patients 
either  had  disease  progression  (1  patient  [6.3%])  or  were  categorised  as  not  evaluable  (3  patients 
[18.8%]); those not evaluable either had stable disease for less than 8 weeks or no evaluable follow-up 
assessment was available.

Best percentage change in tumour size 
Of the 15 patients for whom data were available, 14 patients (93.3%) had a best percentage change in 
tumour  size  that  represented  a decrease  from  baseline  (see  figure  below).  No  data  were  available  for 1 
patient (Patient 16) as he had not received follow-up scans at the time of data cut-off and was, therefore, 
ineligible for tumour response evaluation.

Change in tumour biomarkers 
Only patients with average pre-treatment CTN and CEA levels that were greater than 2 times the ULN 
were evaluable for response; all 16 patients met this criterion. 
Calcitonin (CTN) 
Overall,  12  patients  (75.0%)  achieved  PR  and  no  patients  had  CR  based  on  CTN  data  (Table  10).  The 
remaining 4 patients (25.0%) either had stable disease for 12 or more weeks (1 patient [6.3%] with an 
unconfirmed PR) or were not evaluable (3 patients [18.8%]). 
In  total,  13  patients  (81.3%)  had  a  best  percentage  change  in  CTN  levels  that  represented  a  decrease 
from baseline of at least 50.0% during the study (Figure 3). No data were available for 1 patient (Patient 
16)  as  he  did  not  have  any  biomarker  values  recorded  at  the  baseline  assessment  and  was,  therefore, 
ineligible for biomarker response evaluation.

patients (12.5%) had disease progression and 2 patients (12.5%) were not evaluable. 
In  total,  9  patients  (56.3%)  had  a  best  percentage  change  in  CEA  levels  that  represented  a  decrease 
from baseline of at least 50.0% during the study. No data were available for 1 patient (Patient 16) as he

Overall survival 
No patients had died at the time of data cut-off; consequently, OS could not be calculated for this patient 
population at this time. The minimum time from first dose to data cut-off or study discontinuation was 30 
days, while the maximum time was 1405 days.

2.4.3.  Supportive studies 
Some comparison to the adult MTC data (Studies 08, 58 and 68) was made.  
In Study 08, 30 patients received vandetanib 300 mg. There were more females than males, and the 
majority of patients were Caucasian. The mean age for this study population was 48.7 years. All but 1 
patient had metastatic disease at the time of study entry. The majority of patients had MEN2a, which is 
representative of the hereditary MTC population. All 30 patients (100%) had previously undergone 
disease-related surgery; 36.7% had received radiotherapy, and 26.7% had received other cancer 
therapy. The World Health Organization performance status (WHO PS) score at study entry was 0 (normal 
activity) for 50.0% of the patients, 1 (restricted activity) for 46.7%, and 2 (in bed ≤ 50% of the time) for 
3.3% (1 patient). Thirteen patients were discontinued from vandetanib therapy because of patient not 
willing to continue treatment (n=2), adverse events (AEs; n=7), and disease progression (n=4). 
In Study 68, 19 patients with locally advanced or metastatic hereditary MTC received vandetanib 100 mg. 
The majority of patients were male, and all but 1 patient was Caucasian; the mean age was 44.7 years. 
All patients except 1 had distant metastases at study entry; the most common metastatic sites were the 
liver, bone and locomotor, lymph nodes, and respiratory. RET mutation status was positive for 17 
patients and unknown for 2 patients. A total of 8 patients treated with vandetanib 100 mg discontinued 
from vandetanib therapy, because of patient not willing to continue treatment (n=1), AEs (n=3), or 
condition under investigation worsened (n=4). 
In Study 58, a total of 231 patients were randomised to the vandetanib arm and 100 patients to the 
placebo arm. All patients randomised to vandetanib received vandetanib and all patients except 1 who 
were randomised received study drug. One patient was randomised to placebo but died of progressive 
MTC before receiving treatment. A total of 111 (48.1%) patients in the vandetanib arm continued to 
receive randomised treatment at the date of data cut-off (31 July 2009), compared with 28 patients 
(28.0%) in the placebo arm. Mean age was 51.5 years and there were more males than females (57.4% 
vs 42.6%). A total of 95.2% of patients were Caucasian (White).  
Overall, 90.3% of patients had undergone thyroidectomy before entering the study. A total of 45.0% of 
patients had a medical history of diarrhoea and 15.4% of patients had a history of fatigue, while 94.6% 
of patients in the 2 treatment groups had Stage IVC disease at entry. Among patients with hereditary 
MTC, 48.5% of patients in the 2 treatment arms had a family history of MTC. MEN2a was the most 
common associated syndrome in the 2 treatment arms.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is supported by one pivotal study in children and adolescents with MTC (study 98) and 3 
supportive studies in paediatric patients with glioma-related tumours (study 04, 51 and 61). Study 98 is 
an open-label single-centre, non-comparative Phase I/II study. The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR, 
assessed by the investigator. Secondary endpoints included change in calcitonin (CTN) and 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, PFS and OS.  
The planned single arm design of the paediatric study 98 in 21 patients was discussed in the PDCO. It 
was considered that a single non controlled study in a small number of patients using other than time-
related endpoints would not be sufficient to establish efficacy. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged that it 
was under debate whether a comparative study is feasible, given the very low incidence of MTC in the 
paediatric population and the lack of standard treatment for these patients.  Originally it was planned to 
include 21 patients, but due to recruitment difficulties only 16 patients of the age between 9 and 17 were 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 42/61 
 
  
  
 
enrolled. Thus, the PDCO considered that existing paediatric data from study 98 should be provided 
together with additional analyses synthesising the data from study 98 and further paediatric studies 
(studies 04, 51 and 61). A modelling report was also requested for assessment in order to predict 
pharmacokinetic variability and to substantiate dosing proposals (see clinical pharmacology).  
Paediatric clinical trial data with vandetanib in MTC is limited to 16 patients aged 9 years to 17 years with 
hereditary MTC. There is no experience with Caprelsa in patients 5-8 years of age in this study (see SmPC 
section 5.1). Although hereditary MTC is rare in children aged 5 to 9 years of age, it is anticipated that 
the effects of vandetanib are similar to those in children from 9 years of age and older because of disease 
similarities.  
The clinical study did not include paediatric patient with sporadic MTC, which is acceptable as this occurs 
much less frequently in the paediatric population than hereditary MTC.  
The use of ORR according to RECIST 1.0 as primary endpoint is not considered the most recommendable 
variable for a confirmatory trial. Nevertheless, given the design of the study and the unmet medical need, 
this could be acceptable. Other secondary variables are supported. With regards to protocol amendments, 
no impact on the B/R assessment of Caprelsa is expected for the use in paediatric metastatic MTC.  
Although the number of patients was limited, results based on the primary endpoint are considered 
clinically meaningful. ORR in the evaluable population was 43.8%. All the responses were partials 
(43.8%) or stable disease for at least 8 weeks (31.3%). Disease Control Rate including best response or 
Stable Disease >24 weeks was 75.0% (see table 14). The radiologic response results were supported by 
responses on the tumours markers CTN and CEA. In this respect, in total 13 of the 15 evaluable patients 
(81.3%) had a best percentage decrease in CTN levels from baseline of at least 50% and 9 of the 15 
evaluable patients (56.3%) had a best percentage decrease in CEA levels from baseline of at least 50%. 
These response rates (ORR and on tumour markers) were comparable with the response rates that were 
reported for adult MTC in the pivotal registration study 98 and indicate an anti-tumour activity of Caprelsa 
against MTC in children with a RET mutation. 
The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was approximately 46 months. The accuracy of this 
median PFS data is doubtful given the open label design of the study with PFS assessed by the 
investigator, the low number of patients included in the study and the low frequency of tumour 
assessment i.e. after the first 5 treatment cycles only once every 4 cycles (of each 28 days). No patients 
died during the study and follow-up for overall survival (OS) ranged from 30 to 1405 days.Although it is 
not clear whether the children included in the study had symptomatic disease, and the provided 
information on the aggressiveness of the tumours in the study population was limited, aggressive disease 
is anticipated for most of study population because almost all of the patients included in study 98 had 
MEN2B tumours which are generally highly proliferative tumours with a relative high mortality rate. In 
one large study, death from MTC occurred in 50 percent of patients with MEN2B versus 9.7 percent of 
those with MEN2A (Eng C, et al., 1996). Therefore, the same restrictions of the indication is 
recommended for paediatric population i.e. patients with aggressive and symptomatic, unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic, medullary thyroid cancer. 
Furthermore, in total 15 of the 16 patients in Study 98 (93.8%) had the M918T mutation, which is a 
characteristic of the MEN 2B subtype of hereditary MTC. No data regarding the effect of Caprelsa in 
paediatric MTC without RET mutation is available. Thus, in line with the adult indication, a statement 
regarding the lack of efficacy data for RET negative patients is included in section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
In all cases (adult patients, paediatric patients and at every moment during treatment) continuation of 
treatment should be evaluated by the physician. Adult patients were treated with Caprelsa until objective 
disease progression, provided they did not meet any other withdrawal criteria. It seems that there is no 
or only very limited experience with treatment continuation after progression and the benefit of treatment 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 43/61 
 
  
  
beyond progression is questioned. Therefore, vandetanib may be administered until disease progression 
or until the benefits of treatment continuation do no longer outweigh its risk, thereby considering the 
severity of adverse events (see sections 4.8) in relation to the degree of clinical stabilization of the 
tumour status (see section 4.2).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
 Whilst the pivotal study size is small owing to the rarity of MTC in children, it is considered 
representative of the target population (see SmPC sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1). The totality of the data 
supports the efficacy of vandetanib in children and adolescents aged 5 years and older. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The existing safety profile of vandetanib in adults was mainly based on one pivotal Phase 3 trial (study 
58) investigating the efficacy and safety of vandetanib 300mg versus placebo in 331 patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Supportive safety data was obtained in two Phase II 
studies (08 and 68) in adult patients with MTC.  
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions have been diarrhoea, rash, nausea, hypertension, 
phototoxicity and headache. Vandetanib at a dose of 300 mg is associated with a substantial and 
concentration dependent prolongation in QTc (mean 28 msec, median 35 msec). Serious toxicities, such 
as Torsades de pointes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, interstitial lung disease 
(sometimes fatal) and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, Reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome -RPLS) have infrequently occurred in patients treated with vandetanib 
monotherapy. 
Patient exposure 
The safety data for vandetanib use in paediatric patients is provided from the NCI-sponsored study in 
MTC (Study 98) and 3 investigator-sponsored paediatric studies in different indications (Glioma, or 
neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma). This includes 16 patients in Study 98, 9 patients in Study 04, 35 
patients in Study 51 and 10 patients in Study 61 (total of 70 paediatric patients). 
The MAH was not the sponsor for these studies; however, the MAH sought additional data and 
information from the NCI for Study 98 and a CSR has been completed. Information on the 3 investigator-
sponsored paediatric studies in indications other than MTC is based on published manuscripts. 
These data show that the median duration of exposure to vandetanib in the paediatric MTC study (Study 
98; 750 days) was similar to that in the pivotal adults MTC study (Study 58; 630.7 days).

Adverse events 
The most common AEs in Study 98 were diarrhoea (93.8%), prolonged QTc interval (93.8%), elevation of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT; (81.3%), proteinuria (81.3%) and rash: acne/acneiform (81.3%). 
Diarrhoea, prolonged QTc interval and rash were also reported commonly in adults in Study 58, although 
the incidences were lower than in paediatric patients. Although increases in ALT and proteinuria were not 
reported as frequent AEs in adults in Study 58, laboratory data in adults showed that these also occurred 
in adult patients treated with vandetanib.

The most common CTCAEs ≥Grade 3 in Study 98 included diarrhoea and increases in transaminases (ALT 
and aspartate aminotransferase; AST). A higher proportion of patients in Study 98 had adverse events of 
common  terminology  criteria  for  adverse  events  (CTCAE)  Grade  3  or  above  (81.3%  [13  patients]) 
compared with Study 58 (55.4% [128 patients]).

Review of the growth curves and considering the vandetanib use prior to data cut-off showed 
maintenance of each patient’s growth velocity during drug treatment. Some of the patients actually had 
an improvement in their growth velocity during vandetanib treatment.  
Thyroid status was also monitored and some of the patients were periodically hypothyroid requiring dose 
adjustments of thyroxine (LT4) during the study. Dose increases, on average, of LT4 equal to 36.6% from 
baseline doses were required to normalize the patients’ thyroid status. In this population, there were no 
clinical sequelae as a result of periods of hypothyroidism including no impact on growth velocity.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the paediatric MTC study, Study 98, and a discussion of deaths in the other 
paediatric studies is not considered relevant for the MTC indication, since glioma and neuroblastoma are 
associated with a much worse prognosis than MTC (24 of the 25 patients in Study 04, 24 of the 35 
patients in Study 51 and 2 of the 10 patients in Study 61, died due to disease progression during the 
study period). 
Laboratory findings 
In the paediatric MTC study, Study 98, there were no clinically significant findings in haematology, clinical 
chemistry or urinalysis for any of the patients. AEs relating to clinical chemistry changes were consistent 
with findings in the adult population.

In the paediatric MTC study, Study 98, the impact of vandetanib on the growth plate and therefore linear 
growth of the patient was evaluated. The results of the magnetic resonance imaging scans were difficult 
to interpret as the mean growth plate volumes measured across all patients fluctuated over the course of 
the study; however, all children and adolescents demonstrated linear growth while receiving vandetanib. 
A similar lack of effect on the growth plate was also reported in the glioma studies. 
A search has been performed of the MAH patient safety database (the SAPPHIRE database) for suspected, 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs); no cases were reported in this database from Study 98 
during the period from the data cut-off date for the Study 98 (17 July 2011) to 15 June 2015. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patients in Study 98 were discontinued from treatment because of AEs. In contrast, 28 (12.1%) of 
adult patients in the vandetanib group of Study 58 discontinued due to an AE; asthenia and rash were the 
most common events leading to discontinuation in the adult population. Dose reduction was used to 
manage toxicity and the most common dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was diarrhoea (required for 3 
patients; Summary of Clinical Safety.  
Post marketing experience 
At the last data lock point for the assessment of post-marketing safety data (6 April 2015), vandetanib 
had been approved in over 40 countries worldwide. The cumulative worldwide patient exposure 
(excluding clinical trial exposure) was estimated to be approximately 5325 patients and 2626 patient-
years. 
Post-marketing pharmacovigilance data show that the safety profile for vandetanib has not changed 
significantly since first marketing authorisation. The safety profile remains under surveillance for new 
findings or trends, as per standard safety reporting obligations. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most common adverse events in Study 98 were diarrhoea (93.8%), prolonged QTc interval (93.8%), 
elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT); (81.3%), proteinuria (81.3%) and rash: acne/acneiform 
(81.3%). Diarrhoea, prolonged QTc interval and rash were also reported commonly in adults in Study 58, 
although the incidences were lower than in paediatric patients. Although increases in ALT and proteinuria 
were not reported as frequent AEs in adults in Study 58, laboratory data in adults showed that these also 
occurred in adult patients treated with vandetanib. The most common CTCAEs ≥ Grade 3 in Study 98 
included diarrhoea and increases in transaminases (ALT and aspartate aminotransferase; AST). Diarrhoea 
was also one of the most common CTCAEs ≥ Grade 3 in Study 58 and increases in transaminases to 
Grade 3 were observed in laboratory data. 
Overall, the provided data show that vandetanib in children with hereditary MTC, at doses of 100 or 
150 mg/m2/day, has a global safety profile consistent with that of adult patients with MTC receiving 
vandetanib 300 mg daily. Although the frequency of most adverse events was higher in the paediatric 
population than in the adult population, the comparison is limited without direct comparison. 
Based on provided PK data and disease similarity, the safety and toxicity of vandetanib in adult patients is 
considered relevant for the paediatric population. Nevertheless, for the paediatric population specific 
safety and toxicity issues, including dental and physeal dysplasia were identified which do not occur in the 
adult population. The MAH has presented data showing that use of vandetanib had no adverse effect on 
growth in children and adolescents. Based on height measurements at all visits, all children and 
adolescents in a paediatric study demonstrated linear growth while receiving vandetanib. Accelerated 
growth due to puberty was taken into account when concluding that growth was linear. However, data 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 48/61 
 
  
  
are limited and long term safety data in paediatric patients are not available. Teeth and bone 
development in the paediatric population have been included as new important potential risks in the RMP. 
Paediatric AE reports related to/associated with abnormalities in the linear growth, bone and teeth 
development will be closely monitored, and a specific targeted/guided questionnaire will be provided to 
the health care professional to solicit information specific to growth, bone and teeth development in the 
patient. The data will be periodically reviewed, and also presented as an annual review and analysis in 
PSUR.  
To overcome the lack of suitable formulation, complex dosing regimens have been proposed and could 
lead to dose miscalculation/error or poor compliance (see clinical pharmacology). Medication error related 
to paediatric population has been included in the RMP as new important potential risk and an educational 
material designed to guide parents and healthcare professionals to manage the dosing regimen have 
been developed (see RMP). 
Dose adjustments in paediatric patients with MTC also apply. In the event of CTCAE grade 3 or higher 
toxicity or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval, dosing with vandetanib should be at least temporarily 
stopped and resumed at a reduced dose when toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1. 
Patients who are on the starting dose (a in Table 1 of SmPC section 4.2), should be recommenced at the 
reduced dose (c in Table 1).  Patients who are on the increased dose (b in Table 1), should be 
recommenced at the starting dose (a in Table 1). If another event of common terminology criteria for 
adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval occurs, dosing 
with Caprelsa should be at least temporarily stopped and resumed at a reduced dose (c in Table 1) when 
toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1. If a further event of CTCAE grade 3 or higher toxicity 
or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval occurs, dosing with vandetanib should be permanently stopped 
(see SmPC section 4.2).  
The patient must be monitored appropriately. Due to the 19 day half-life, adverse reactions including a 
prolonged QTc interval may not resolve quickly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Effects on reproduction in paediatric patients treated with vandetanib are not known (see SmPC section 
4.6). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of vandetanib is well characterised in the adult population and has been shown to be 
comparable in children aged 9 to 18 years old. There is no experience in pediatric patients with hereditary 
MTC below 9 years of age (see SmPC section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). A similar exposure to vandetanib is 
expected in 5-8 years old patients compared to patients aged 9-18 years based on data obtained in 
glioma-related indications (see clinical pharmacology). A similar safety profile is expected in paediatric 
patients aged 5-8 years old and ≥ 9 years old. Warnings in the SmPC and measures included in the RMP 
are considered adequate to minimise the risk in the paediatric population. Paediatric adverse events 
reports related to/associated with abnormalities in the linear growth, bone and teeth development as well 
as long term use will be closely monitored. Furthermore, educational material to mitigate the new 
important potential risk of medication error will be implemented (see RMP). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, and 5.2 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Annex II was also updated 
to reflect the changes to the information about additional risk minimisation measures in line with the 
revised RMP. Furthermore, the description of the specific obligation was also shortened for readability. 
Details of the design of the study are included in the risk management plan. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable due to the limited proposed changes 
to the PI that do not significantly alter the readability of the approved document. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study  IRUSZACT0098  recruited  16  patients  aged  between  9  and  17  years  who  all  but  one  received  an 
initial dose of 100 mg/m2/day. One patient received 150 mg/m2/day. The primary efficacy endpoint of the 
pivotal study (Study IRUSZACT0098) was ORR assessed by the investigator. Of the 16 patients included 
in the study 7 patients had a PR, which is 43.8% of the patients. No CRs were reported. Stable disease 
for  at  least  8  weeks  was  reported  in  5  patients  (31.3%).  The  median  PFS  for  the  patients  treated  with 
vandetanib was 46 months.  
The  radiologic  response  results  were  supported  by  responses  on  the  tumours  markers  CTN  and  CEA.  In 
this  respect,  in  total  13  of  the  15  evaluable  patients  (81.3%)  had  a  best  percentage  decrease  in  CTN 
levels from baseline of at least 50% and 9 of the 15 evaluable patients (56.3%) had a best percentage 
decrease in CEA levels from baseline of at least 50%.  
Supportive evidence of efficacy in patients with MTC is available from relevant data obtained in the adult 
population (study 58). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016

The study size is small owing to the rarity of MTC in children. Nevertheless the study is considered 
representative of the target population.  
There is no experience in paediatric patients with hereditary MTC below 9 years of age. However similar 
exposure to vandetanib is expected in patients aged 5-9 years old based on PK data in paediatric patients 
with glioma. Hence, vandetanib is indicated in paediatric patients above 5 years of age. Vandetanib is not 
indicated in children below 5 years of age (see SmPC 4.1). Given the rarity of unresectable or metastatic 
hereditary MTC in paediatric patient, studies had been waived for patients <5 years of age, as the disease 
is extremely uncommon in this age group.   
The  median  PFS  for  the  patients  treated  with  vandetanib  was  46  months.  The  accuracy  of  this  median 
PFS data is uncertain given the open label design of the study with PFS assessed by the investigator, the 
low number of patients included in the study and the low frequency of tumour assessment i.e. after the 
first  5  treatment  cycles  only  once  every  4  cycles  (of  each  28  days).  Moreover,  due  to  the  lack  of 
comparative data, interpretation of the PFS data is hampered. However, it does give support to efficacy 
taking into account the type of patients that were included in the clinical trial. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs in Study 98 were diarrhoea (93.8%), prolonged QTc interval (93.8%), elevation of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (81.3%), proteinuria (81.3%) and rash: acne/acneiform (81.3%). 
In this respect, Grade 3 or higher grade AEs were reported in 13 (81.3%) of the paediatric patients. The 
most frequently reported events were diarrhoea (43.8%), ALT and AST elevations (25% and 18.8%) 
respectively. One patient had SAEs which included liver dysfunction/failure, obstruction gastrointestinal, 
and pain. None of the patients discontinued study treatment due to AEs.  
Despite the high incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs, the toxicity of vandetanib in children seems to be 
manageable as none of the patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. Moreover, the long treatment 
period (median of more than 24) suggests that the anti-cancer therapy was reasonably tolerated. 
Overall, the provided data show that vandetanib in children with hereditary MTC, at doses of 100 or 
150 mg/m2/day, has a global safety profile consistent with that of adult patients with MTC receiving 
vandetanib 300 mg daily. The frequency of most adverse events was higher in the paediatric population 
than in the adult population although no formal conclusion can be made without direct comparison. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The follow up time of patients was limited and the long term safety of vandetanib including the effect of 
vandetanib on developmental and maturation processes in children is not known. While the available data 
are limited, these showed that use of vandetanib had no adverse effect on growth in children and 
adolescents treated in study 98. Paediatric adverse events reports related to/associated with 
abnormalities in the linear growth, bone and teeth development as well as long term use will be closely 
monitored (see RMP). 
There is no experience in paediatric patients with hereditary MTC below 9 years of age. However similar 
exposure to vandetanib is expected in this patient subgroup based on PK data in paediatric patients with 
glioma aged 2-17 years. Although hereditary MTC is rare in children aged 5 to 9 years of age, it is 
anticipated that the safety of vandetanib are similar to those in children from 9 years of age and older 
because of disease similarities.  
Considering the complex dosing regimen there is a potential risk of dose miscalculation and/or error. The 
MAH has provided educational material designed to guide parents to manage the dosing regimen and will

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Clinically relevant efficacy in the treatment of paediatric patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic MTC has been shown. Furthermore, the results of Study 98 showed that vandetanib in children 
with MTC, at a starting dose of 100 mg/m2/day, has a similar tolerability profile to the adult MTC 
population (from Studies 58, 08 and 68). Supportive evidence of efficacy and safety of vandetanib in 
patients with MTC is available from relevant data obtained in the adult population. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Taking into account the relatively high response rate of vandetanib in paediatric MTC, the general 
manageable toxicity and the lack of effective alternatives, the benefit of treating children with metastatic 
or unresectable MTC is considered to outweigh the risks.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Hereditary  MTC  is  characterised  by  germline  mutations  in  the  RET  proto-oncogene.  The  underlying 
genetic  cause  of  the  disease  is  identical  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients,  therefore  the  activity  of 
vandetanib  in  paediatric  patients  with  this  disease  is  expected  to  be  similar  to  that  in  adults.  Similarity 
between  the  adult  and  paediatric  patient  population  included  in  the  main  studies  is  not  completely 
assured as in the pivotal study in adults (study 58) the patient population was rather heterogeneous with 
regard  to  pre-treatment,  the  type  of  tumour  comprised  of  hereditary  and  presumably  predominantly 
sporadic MTC, and consisted mainly of MEN 2A in adults versus almost all MEN 2B in children. However, it 
is  noted  that  there  was  a  dose-dependent  response  observed  in  adults  and  that  the  PK  results  showed 
comparable exposure between children above the age of 9 years dosed 100 mg/m2 and adults dosed at 
300 mg.  Moreover,  there  were  comparable  ORR  and  biomarker  results  between  the  paediatric  as  adult 
MTC  patients,  while  in  the  adult  study  it  was  shown  that  positive  ORR  translated  in  prolongation  of  the 
PFS. Therefore, available data in adult are considered relevant in support of the paediatric indication.  
Considering the disease similarity and the similar exposure to vandetanib obtained in patients aged 5 to 8 
years compared to older children aged 9 to 18 years old, it is considered acceptable to extend the 
indication to the 5-8 years old population, also taken into account the rarity of the pathology. 
When evaluating the data in the adult population at the time of the initial application, it was questioned 
which patient is most likely to derive the most benefit in particular in a disease setting with a relatively 
long survival i.e. when the disease is relatively stable (see Caprelsa EPAR). In this perspective, the 
optimal moment of treatment initiation was also discussed and it was recommended that Caprelsa is used 
in patients with highly progressive and symptomatic disease who have a pronounced need for immediate 
therapy. The adult indication was therefore restricted to patients with aggressive and symptomatic, 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Given the low number of paediatric 
patients included it is not possible to identify a specific paediatric subgroup for which Caprelsa treatment 
would be especially beneficial. However, aggressive disease is anticipated for most of study population 
because almost all of the patients included in study 98 had MEN2B tumours which are generally highly

proliferative tumours with a relative high mortality rate. Therefore, Caprelsa is also recommended in 
paediatric patients with aggressive and symptomatic, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, 
medullary thyroid cancer. 
Based on the totality of the evidence including supportive efficacy and safety data from the adult 
population, a positive benefit-risk balance is concluded for Caprelsa in the treatment of aggressive and 
symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in children and adolescents aged 5 years and older with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.

•  CAPRELSA treatment must not be started in patients: 
o  Whose ECG QTc interval is greater than 480 msec; 
o  Who have congenital long QTc syndrome; 
o  Who  have  a  history  of  Torsades  de  pointes  unless  all  risk  factors  that  contributed  to 
Torsades de pointes have been corrected; 
•  The  need  for  an  ECG,  and  serum  levels  of  potassium,  calcium  and  magnesium  and  thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) and the times and situations when it should be performed; 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199988/2016 
Page 59/61 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Patients who develop a single value of corrected ECG QTc interval of at least 500 msec should stop 
taking CAPRELSA. Dosing can be resumed at a reduced dose after return of the ECG QTc interval 
to pre-treatment status has been confirmed and correction of possible electrolyte imbalance has 
been made;

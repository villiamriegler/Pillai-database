Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-
modified) (Spikevax), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Paraesthesia 
In view of available data on paraesthesia from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including cases with 
a plausible temporal relationship, and in view of plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) and paraesthesia 
is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) should be amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the 
product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

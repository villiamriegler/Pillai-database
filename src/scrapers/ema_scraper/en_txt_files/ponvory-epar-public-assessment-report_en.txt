1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 2 March 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ponvory, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 September 2018. 
The  applicant  applied  for  the  following  indication  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of 
multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).

EMEA/H/SA/2170/2/2011/II pertains to clinical aspects, specifically study design and primary endpoint 
for  a  trial  to  test  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  ponesimod  in  patients  with  clinically  isolated 
syndrome. 
EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/2011/III pertains to non-clinical and clinical aspects for studies on clinically isolated 
syndrome and RMS:  
•  Regarding  the  non-clinical  aspects,  it  was  agreed  that  the  non-clinical  package  was  rather 
complete, but it was recommended to justify the absence of secondary pharmacology studies 
and to further evaluate toxicity including reproductive toxicity. The applicant was informed that 
an  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  would  be  needed  to  be  available  before  marketing 
authorisation application (MAA). Additionally, the development drug plans for a combination with 
other DMT were discouraged.  
•  Regarding the pharmacological and clinical aspects, the approach to dose finding was agreed but 
it was recommended to further address the potential drug-drug interactions for ponesimod. With 
regards  to  the  clinical  studies,  the  following  aspects  of  the  study  design  were  discussed: 
superiority  study  versus  Avonex/placebo,  an  open-label  rater  blinded  design,  primary 
(annualised  relapse  rate  [ARR]  versus  time  to  first  relapse)  and  secondary  endpoints 
(hierarchical order and fatigue scale), pooled analysis for disability. The use of placebo, time-to-
event primary endpoint and the open-label rater-blinded assessment were not discouraged. It 
was recommended to further discuss the hierarchical order of secondary endpoints. With regards 
to fatigue, the applicant was informed that an effect on fatigue could be claimed provided the 
effect is apart from statistically significant, also clinically significant. Further advice was given on 
safety (lymphocyte counts monitoring).  
EMEA/H/SA/2170/4/2014/II pertains to clinical aspects in relation to an add on indication for relapsing 
forms of MS who have active disease despite treatment with dimethyl fumarate. This SA is not relevant 
for this MAA.  
EMA/H/SA/2170/FU/1/2014/III pertains to non-clinical and clinical aspects.  
• 
The non-clinical aspects  were related to the add on indication and therefore, not relevant for this 
MAA.  
•  Regarding  clinical  aspects,  the  applicant  presented  a  modified  drug  development  plan  including 
teriflunomide  14  mg  as  active  comparator  which  was  found  acceptable.  Regarding  the  study 
population, the applicant was advised to include sufficient patients with low and highly active RRMS 
in case the benefit risk (B/R) can only be considered positive for the later. The inclusion of subjects 
with  SPMS  with  superimposed  relapses  was  discouraged  as  it  might  complicate  trial  design  and 
hamper the interpretation of the effect on disability, although it was agreed that an effect on relapses 
can  be  extrapolated  from  RRMS  to  SPMS  based  on  the  same  underlying  pathophysiology  i.e. 
inflammatory  process.  The  applicant  was  advised  to  include  disability  progression  as  the  main 
secondary endpoint in line with the Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 9/136 
 
  
 
 
Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/77185/2011, Rev 2) and therefore invited to revise the 
hierarchical order. Further recommendations were given for statistical methods including regression 
models, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and sample size. Moreover, the applicant received 
advice  about  requirements/recommendations  in  the  context  of  MAA  based  on  one  pivotal  trial 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99) including the level of significance (e.g. 2-sided p<0.01) but also the need for 
internal  consistency  (similar  effects  in  sub-populations),  high  trial  quality.  With  regards  to  dose 
selection is phase 3 studies, it was agreed that the 20 mg dose is the chosen dose for phase 3 based 
on a reduced tolerability with the 40 mg dose but the applicant was invited to evaluate whether a 
dose of 30 mg would provide potential benefit for disease progression over the 20 mg while remaining 
safe. Finally, the safety monitoring plan was discussed, and it was recommended to further justify 
the use of an up-titration scheme in phase 3 in relation to the dose escalation in phase 2 trials.  
EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/FU/2/2018/I  pertains  to  a  single  quality  question  on  the  suitability  of  the  two 
starting materials.  
EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/FU/2/2018/II pertains to a single clinical question on the suitability of the proposed 
revision  of  the  secondary  endpoints  and  multiplicity  testing  strategy  while  the  study  was  going.  The 
proposed revision placed the endpoint “time to 12-week confirmed disability accumulation (CDA) from 
baseline to end of study (EOS)”, previously the first endpoint at the end of a new strategy including the 
“change from baseline to Week 108 in fatigue-related symptoms as measured by the symptoms domain 
of  the  Fatigue  Symptom  and  Impact  Questionnaire-Relapsing  Multiple  Sclerosis  (FSIQ–RMS)”  and 
“cumulative number of combined unique active lesions (CUAL) from baseline to Week 108” as first and 
second endpoints, respectively. Given that the proposed changes are motivated by results seen in other 
studies and not by data collected in the ongoing study, the applicant’s claim that data collected remain 
fully  blinded  to  the  sponsor  and  that  the  measures  of  disability  remained,  the  new  strategy  was 
considered acceptable. However, it was recommended to switch the secondary endpoint “Time to 12-
week  CDA  from  baseline  up  to  EOS”  with  the  exploratory  endpoint  “Time  to  first  24-week  CDA  from 
baseline up to EOS”. It was also advised that positioning disability progression in hierarchy order is not 
in  line  with  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  guideline  on  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis  (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, 
Rev. 2) that states that disability progression should be considered the key secondary endpoint (if not 
the first one). Even if at the time of submission for a MAA all endpoints will be assessed regardless of 
statistical  significance  or  order  of  testing,  it  was  noted  that  the  new  hierarchical  strategy  would  only 
allow to test CDA at the full alpha level if the other two secondary endpoints were successful. 
EMA/H/SA/2170/4/FU/2/2019/I pertains to a single quality question on the suitability of the starter pack 
design consisting of nine different dose strengths with different tablet sizes and different colours to be 
administered over the 14-day period.  
EMA/H/SA/2170/4/FU/2/2019/II pertains to clinical aspects including (i) cardiac monitoring in ongoing 
studies;  (ii)  expected B/R supporting the intended  MAA indication (patients  with RMS); (iii) statistical 
analysis  plan  (SAP)  for  Study  B301;  (iv)  secondary  endpoint  analysis;  and  (v)  pooling  strategy  for 
ponesimod safety data:  
• 
• 
It was considered that further data sustaining a “better safety profile” compared to a non-selective 
S1P modulator was needed prior to lift the requirement for first-dose monitoring in patients without 
risk  factors  and  to  reduce  the  duration  of  first  dose  monitoring  in  those  with  risk  factors  for 
symptomatic bradycardia or heart block.  
It  was  noted  that  that  a  positive  B/R  will  need  to  be  demonstrated  across  the  disease  activity 
spectrum, including patients with SPMS and overlapping relapses. The recommendation of including 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 10/136 
 
  
 
 
enough  patients  with  low  and  high  level  of  activity  (EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/FU1/2014/III)  was 
reiterated.  
•  Aspects of the study design were further discussed. The CHMP was in agreement with the evaluation 
of the primary endpoint in B301, with the caveat that missing data imputation should target a full 
treatment  policy  strategy  rather  than  a  partial  one.  Regarding  the  testing  of  the  primary  null 
hypothesis and the change proposed by the applicant “the primary null hypothesis was to be tested 
at a two-sided 1% alpha level for conclusive evidence and 5% for a positive study”, the CHMP stated 
that  the  previously  agreed  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/429513/2014)  level  of  significance  of  1%  would  be 
required to justify the use of a single pivotal study.  
• 
• 
It  was  noted  that  recommendation  on  the  secondary  endpoints  and  hierarchical  order  were  only 
partially  implemented  because  24-week  CDA  was  included  as  a  secondary  endpoint  after  the  12-
week  CDA  (#4rank).  Recommendations  were  given  to  handle  the  potential  bias  due  to  informed 
censoring with regards to time to CDA endpoints.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is treatment of adult patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or 
imaging features. 
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  an  inflammatory  immune-mediated  and  neurodegenerative  disorder  of  the 
central nervous system (CNS). This disease is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical expression, an 
unpredictable  course,  and  a  variable  prognosis.  MS  is  characterised  by  inflammation,  demyelination, 
neuronal  and  oligodendrocyte  loss,  and  disruption  of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  leading  to  irreversible 
deficits in physical function and cognition and an impaired quality of life. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The estimated number of people with MS increased was 2.8 million in 2013 worldwide. (MS International 
Federation,  2020).  In  Europe,  the  median  prevalence  is  133  cases  per  100,000,  and  the  highest 
prevalence  of  MS  occurs  in  countries  with  higher  latitudes,  including  Sweden  (218  per  100,000), 
Denmark (282 per 100,000) and Germany (303 per 100,000). 
MS is usually diagnosed during early adulthood, with an average age of onset of 32 years. MS is twice 
as common among women than men. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Although the aetiology of MS is still unknown, it is widely accepted that it is an immune-mediated process 
triggered by only partially understood environmental factors in genetically susceptible people.  
MS results from a cascade of events involving activation of both adaptive and innate immune system, 
both acute focal and diffuse chronic inflammation, demyelination, culminating in neuroaxonal loss in the 
CNS, namely retina, spinal cord and brain. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The  two  main  clinical  features  of  MS  are  exacerbations  (also  called  attacks  or  relapses)  and  chronic, 
progressive  loss  of  neurological  function.  Relapses  are  considered  the  clinical  expression  of  acute, 
inflammatory  and  demyelinating,  focal  lesions  of  the  CNS  which  leads  to  the  slowing  or  blockade  of 
axonal conduction at diverse affected sites of the CNS. After the acute phase, permanent disability as 
clinical  sequalae  represents  irreversible  neuro-axonal  injury  due  to  focal  inflammation.  In  MS, 
progression  in  neuronal  disability  is  due  to  accumulation  of  neuro-axonal  injury  either  due  to  focal 
inflammation or due to diffuse chronic neuroinflammation 
Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 85% of 
patients at diagnosis. According to earlier natural history studies, approximately 50% of patients with 
RRMS will, within the first 20 years after diagnosis, develop secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which is 
characterised  by  worsening  disability  independently  of  the  presence  or  absence  of  relapses.  Recent 
findings from cohorts of patients mostly treated with DMTs from early onset have found lower transition 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 12/136 
 
  
 
 
rates to SPMS. Additionally, primary progressive MS is the presenting form at diagnosis in approximately 
15% of MS patients and is characterised by chronic worsening of disability early in the disease and in 
the absence of relapses 
The evaluation of suspected MS begins with a detailed clinical history and examination. According to MS 
International  Federation,2013  MS  Atlas,  the  most  common  presenting  symptoms  were  found  to  be 
sensory (40%), and motor (39%), and the least common were pain (15%) and cognitive issues (10%). 
The  widely  used  McDonald  diagnostic  criteria  have  been  developed  to  facilitate  earlier  diagnosis  and 
initiation of treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid findings can be utilised 
to support clinical diagnostic criteria for MS.  
No prognostic indicators are established as reliable, and accurate prediction of outcome for an individual 
patient. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There  is  no  cure  available  for  MS.  Therapies  for  MS  include  treatment  for  relapses  (e.g.  steroids), 
symptomatic treatments (e.g. drugs for fatigue and pain) and those that alter the course of the disease 
(disease-modifying therapies [DMTs]).  
There are currently several approved DMTs in MS with different efficacy and safety profiles.  
The  injectable  interferons  (IFN)  (interferons  β-1a  and  β-1b)  and  glatiramer  acetate  have  a  well-
established  efficacy  and  safety  profile.  The  safety  profile  for  the  IFNs  includes  depression  and  risk  of 
suicide, hepatic injury, decreased peripheral blood count, anaphylaxis, and injection-site reactions. For 
glatiramer  acetate,  safety  concerns  include  immediate  post-injection  reactions/necrosis  and  transient 
chest pain.  
The safety profile of approved sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators fingolimod, siponimod 
and ozanimod includes cardiac effects  at initiation  of treatment (bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular 
[AV] block) and QT prolongation, infections including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), 
respiratory effects, increased liver enzymes and blood pressure and malignancies. Due to these safety 
issues, the first approved oral nonselective S1P receptor modulator fingolimod was indicated for RRMS 
patients with highly active disease despite a previous DMT or for rapidly evolving, severe MS. 
Dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide are oral agents that have demonstrated moderate efficacy in the 
treatment  of  RRMS.  The  safety  profile  of  dimethyl  fumarate  includes  gastrointestinal  adverse  events 
(AEs), flushing, lymphopenia, infections including PML, liver injury. The safety profile for teriflunomide 
includes  hepatotoxicity,  bone  marrow  suppression,  peripheral  neuropathy,  increased  blood  pressure, 
interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity and serious skin reactions and teratogenicity. These agents also 
have slow pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) reversibility and high propensity for drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs) as well as complexities related to metabolism (requiring genotyping). 
Cladribine is a highly effective oral treatment for RRMS patients with highly active disease. The safety 
profile  includes  prolonged  lymphocyte  count  reduction,  infections  including  potential  reactivation  of 
tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B and malignancies.  
Natalizumab was the first monoclonal antibody DMT approved for highly active RRMS. The safety profile 
includes  PML,  herpes  encephalitis,  meningitis  and  acute  retinal  necrosis,  hepatotoxicity,  and  serious 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Alemtuzumab is a highly effective monoclonal therapy originally indicated for RRMS patients with active 
disease. The safety profile of alemtuzumab includes infusion-related reactions, infections, autoimmune 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 13/136 
 
  
 
 
disorders  including  immune  thrombocytopenia,  nephropathies  and  thyroid  disorders,  stroke  and 
increased risk of malignancy.  
Ocrelizumab, another highly effective monoclonal DMT administered intravenously, is also indicated for 
RRMS  patients  with  active  disease,  as  well  as  early  primary  progressive  MS.  The  safety  profile  of 
ocrelizumab  includes  infusion-related  reactions  and  infections  including  PML,  herpes  and  hepatitis  B 
reactivation; an increased risk for malignancies, may exist. Ofatumumab, another anti-CD20 monoclonal 
DMT administered subcutaneously, is indicated for active RMS. The safety profile of ofatumumab includes 
injection-related reactions and infections.   
Appropriate  treatment  is  selected  on  an  individual  patient  basis,  depending  on  patient  and  disease 
characteristics  and  the  drug-profile,  including  mechanisms  of  action,  risk  profile,  and  monitoring 
requirements.  Despite the availability of a number of medications for the treatment of MS, there remains 
a need for an effective oral agent with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. 
About the product 
Ponesimod  (JNJ-67896153/ACT-128800),  is  an  iminothiazolidinone  derivative,  and  is  an  orally  active, 
selective modulator of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). It binds with high affinity to S1P1 
receptors  located  on  lymphocytes  and  in  other  cell  types,  e.g.  cardiomyocytes.  Ponesimod  blocks  the 
capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral 
blood.  
Ponesimod is proposed to be used in the treatment of adult patients with RMS with active disease defined 
by clinical or imaging features. It is formulated as film-coated tablets to be dosed orally at a dose 20 mg 
once daily, following a gradual 14-day up-titration regimen starting with 2 mg. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis is Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The applicant sought SA on several occasions during the development of ponesimod. The SA pertained 
to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspect as summarised above. Regarding quality aspects, 
the recommendations received concerning the starting materials have been followed by the applicant. 
The  non-clinical  development  programme  has  been  conducted  in  compliance  with  the  respective 
EMA/ICH  guidelines  and  recommendations  received  have  been  also  largely  followed  by  the  applicant. 
With  regard  to  the  clinical  development  programme,  the  provided  SA  were  not  fully  followed,  most 
importantly  the  advice  regarding  the  testing  hierarchy  of  secondary  endpoints,  positioning  disability 
progression in the testing hierarchy first after relapse rate, was not followed. 
The  applicant  had  MAA  pre-submission  meetings  with  the  Co-Rapporteur  (Latvia,  State  Agency  of 
Medicines) and the Rapporteur (The Netherlands, Medicines Evaluation Board) on 23 September 2019 
and 25 September 2019, respectively.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  ponesimod  is  (2Z,5Z)-5-[3-chloro-4-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropoxy]benzylidene]-
3-(2-methylphenyl)-2-(propylimino)-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula 
C23H25ClNzO4S. It has a relative molecular mass of 460.97 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of ponesimod is inferred from the route of synthesis and further elucidated by a 
combination  of  elemental  analysis,  infrared  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet  spectroscopy,  1H  and  13C  NMR 
spectroscopy  and  mass  spectrometry  with  single  crystal  x-ray  structure  analysis  to  confirm  absolute 
configuration  of  the  single  (R)-stereocentre.  The  solid-state  properties  of  the  active  substance  were 
measured by Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA), x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and gravimetric vapour sorption (GVS). 
The active substance is a white to light yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. Different polymorphic 
forms  were  identified  throughout  development.  The  manufacturing  process  routinely  delivers  the 
commercial polymorph. 
Ponesimod exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ponesimod  is  synthesised  in  three  main  steps  using  well  defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable 
specifications. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021

The process is sufficiently described. A DoE study indicated ranges for each of the input materials within 
which the levels of critical impurities are kept sufficiently low and the yield is acceptable. These ranges 
are defined as a design space which is deemed acceptable. The critical steps and in-process controls are 
adequately  defined  and  deemed  suitable  for  controlling  the  manufacturing  process.  The  specifications 
for the starting materials and intermediates are acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. The CHMP raised a major objection due to a lack of information 
on the potential presence of mutagenic impurities. In response, the applicant provided a detailed report 
covering actual and potential mutagenic impurities, mutagenicity screening, as well as fate and purge 
studies and calculations. The CHMP concluded that the information was acceptable. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The development of the ponesimod route of synthesis has been discussed, with process iterations and 
optimisations from lab to production scale. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail 
and have been justified. 
The active substance primary packaging complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  set  according  to  ICH  Q6A  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual 
examination),  identity  (IR),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual  solvents  (GC),  impurities  (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC) and particle size distribution (laser light diffraction). 
Limits for impurities are set according to ICH Q3A and are considered appropriate. The manufacturing 
process routinely delivers the desired polymorphic form. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  from  3  production  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed  manufacturer 
stored in packaging representative of the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay, 
chromatographic purity and particle size distribution. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release  and  are  stability  indicating.  In  addition,  colour  and  clarity  of  a  solution,  polymorphism,  water 
content, enantiomeric purity and microbial purity were tested. The methods used are described in the 
dossier. 
No significant trends were observed for any measured parameters. All tested parameters remained within 
the specifications. The results from the additionally tested parameters justify the omission of these tests 
from the specification. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch.  Ponesimod  is 
photosensitive and is stored protected from light. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021

Forced degradation studies were carried out on one batch subjected to heat and moisture in the solid 
state, light in the solid state, acid and basic conditions in solution, and an oxidizing agent in solution. 
Ponesimod in the solid state is stable when exposed to high temperature and humidity but is sensitive 
to light. Degradation occurs in solution at basic or acidic pH and when exposed to an oxidant or radical 
initiator. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  in  the  proposed  container 
protected from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  immediate-release  film-coated  tablets  containing  2  mg,  3  mg,  4 
mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of ponesimod as active substance. The different 
strengths are distinguished by size, colour and debossing as indicated in Figure 2. On the back face, all 
tablets are debossed with an arch. Additionally, the larger tablets (5-20 mg) are debossed with an “A” 
as indicated at the bottom of the figure. 
Figure 2: Appearance of finished product 
The aim of development was to produce an immediate release dosage containing multiple strengths of 
the  active  substance.  Accordingly,  a  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  developed  and  is 
summarised in along with the related critical quality attributes (CQAs) in Table 1.

The excipients chosen are typical for this type of dosage form and compatibility with the active substance 
was shown in studies on binary mixtures. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur.  standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 
of this report. 
In early clinical studies, a hard capsule formulation was used. The formulation was changed to a film-
coated  tablet  containing  the  proposed  commercial  polymorphic  form  of  the  active  substance  for  later 
clinical studies. Bioequivalence between the formulations was demonstrated clinically. Changes to colour 
and debossing were made after phase 3 trials and are not expected to impact bioavailability.  
The applicant described the development of the proposed dissolution method. The CHMP raised a major 
objection to the originally proposed dissolution method as the dissolution rate was rapid and the use of 
a  surfactant  had  not  been  justified.  In  response,  the  applicant  submitted  a  re-developed  method. 
Discriminatory power was investigated in relation to changes in relevant manufacturing parameters and 
material attributes. The applicant committed to further investigate discriminatory power in relation to 
more  extreme  changes  in  manufacturing  parameters  and  the  functional  properties  of  excipients  and 
report the results back to the agency. The revised dissolution method is considered to acceptable, as is 
the specification limit. 
The development of the manufacturing process was described in detail. For each unit operation and step, 
the  potential  impact  on  the  CQAs  was  assessed  and  investigated  experimentally.  Ranges  for  further 
investigation were thus identified. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for certain process 
parameters. In general, the formulation development work is adequately explained. 
The primary packaging is an Alu/Alu blister with desiccant consisting of a laminated Alu cold form film 
with integrated desiccant and a laminated Alu push-through lidding film. The materials comply with Ph. 
Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 11 main steps: dry blending; preparation of granulation solution; 
wet  granulation;  drying;  screening;  blending;  lubrication;  compression;  preparation  of  film-coating 
suspension; film-coating; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated using a bracketing approach given the 
high  number  of  strengths  and  considering  the  similarity  between  the  dose  strengths.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021

quality in a reproducible manner. Critical steps have been defined, along with intermediates. The hold 
time for the bulk tablets has been justified with stability data. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance (visual examination), identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
The  potential  presence  of  elemental  impurities  in  the  finished  product  was  assessed  following  a  risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. It was concluded that there 
is  a  negligible  risk  of  elemental  impurities  based  on  the  process,  raw  materials,  and  manufacturing 
equipment. This was confirmed with analysis data from 4 batches of active substance and 3 batches of 
finished product using a validated ICP-MS, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data 
it can be concluded that no elemental impurity controls are needed. 
A risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
submitted in response to a major objection from CHMP. The assessment considered all suspected and 
actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants 
on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine 
impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure 
under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020).  There  are  no  confirmed  sources  of  nitrosating  agent.  Based  on  the  information 
provided it is accepted that no risk was identified of the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished  product  and  no  additional  control  measures  are  deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for the 20 batches produced during process validation confirming the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  the  18  batches  of  finished  product  manufactured  at  50%  production  scale  in  the 
validation campaign and using the same bracketing approach, stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), 36 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for 
up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were 
provided. The batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
All relevant quality attributes were monitored: appearance, assay, degradants, dissolution and microbial 
purity were investigated. In addition, water content was measured. No significant change was observed 
for any strength after 6 months under accelerated conditions. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021

Under  long  term  and  intermediate  conditions,  no  significant  changes  in  the  physical,  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  characteristics  are  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed,  except  for  a 
decrease in water content over time. This trend was attributed to the presence of the desiccant. 
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Ponvory tablets are photostable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  condition  as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human  and  veterinary  medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. During the procedure, the 
applicant was able to resolve the three major objections raised by CHMP by providing additional data as 
follows: the evaluation of potentially genotoxic impurities was adequately explained; a risk assessment 
for the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities was submitted, indicating that there isn’t a risk of 
nitrosamines contamination; the dissolution method has been replaced and the new method is seen as 
sufficiently discriminatory. Further development work and investigation of discriminatory power will be 
conducted  post-approval  (see  recommendation).  The  design  space  covering  the  quantities  of  input 
materials in steps 2-3 of the active substance manufacturing process has been justified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant should further investigate the discriminatory power of the dissolution method in 
relation to more extreme changes in manufacturing parameters and the functional properties of 
excipients and report the results back to the agency.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary PD of ACT-128800 (ponesimod) have been evaluated in a comprehensive panel of in vitro 
and in vivo studies. 
In vitro 
The potency and agonist activity of ACT-128800 were determined in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) γS-
binding assay, a cyclin adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation assay and a 33P-S1P radioligand-
displacement assay. ACT-128800 proved more effective than the natural ligand S1P on S1P1, whereas 
ACT-128800 was not able to activate sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2) at concentrations of up 
to 10 µM. In addition, ACT-128800 was less potent in activation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 
3 (S1P3) (associated with bradycardia) than S1P but was able to fully activate S1P3 at higher doses. A 
5-fold reduced potency on rat S1P3 receptor was observed as compared to the human counterpart. Also, 
pFTY720, a non-selective S1P receptor modulator, was not able to fully activate rat S1P3. In addition, 
was ACT-128800 not able to fully activate the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1P4) receptor as 
compared to S1P and pFTY720 and it had a higher potency but lower efficacy in activating sphingosine 
1-phosphate receptor 5 (S1P5) than S1P. No agonist activity of ACT-128800 was detected in activating 
lysophosphatidic acid receptors (LPA), LPA1 LPA2 and LPA3 receptors. 
Various metabolites of ACT-128800 have been identified in human plasma of which M12 (ACT-204426) 
and M13 (ACT-338375) were determined as the most abundant ones. Therefore, the potency, as well as 
the agonist activities of these major metabolites on the five human S1P receptors, was comparatively 
determined with the natural ligand S1P in vitro. GTPγS assays in membrane preparations from Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant S1P receptors revealed that M12 and M13 are 10 and 
20 times, respectively, less potent than S1P on the S1P1 receptor. No or negligible potency of M12 and 
M13 was observed on S1P2, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5. These results were essentially confirmed by a resonant 
waveguide grating (RWG)-based assay. 
The lymphopenic effect of ACT-128800 is assumed to be exerted by S1P1 receptor agonists via transient 
receptor desensitisation by internalisation. The effect of the natural ligand S1P, as well as ACT-128800 
and  pFTY720  on  receptor  internalisation,  was  evaluated  in  a  cell-based  assay  employing  recombinant 
CHO-K1 cells. ACT-128800 and pFTY720 triggered sustained receptor internalisation with similar efficacy 
and potency at concentrations > 100 nM. In contrast, S1P caused transient receptor internalisation at 
concentrations  <  100  nM.  At  higher  concentrations,  S1P  induced  a  persistent  decrease  in  receptor 
expression. This difference between synthetic and natural S1P1 ligands is explained by the applicant by 
differences in the dissociation of the ligands from the receptor, i.e. that the natural ligand allows rapid 
resurfacing of the receptor by rapid dissociation which appears to be not the case with synthetic ligands. 
S1P-induced activation of S1P1 and S1P3 receptors are known to mediate extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) signalling, which, in turn, is 
critical  for  cell  survival  and  proliferation.  A  difference  in  the  effect  mediated  by  natural  or  synthetic 
ligands of the S1P1, i.e. transient and sustained receptor desensitisation has already been observed. An 
additional cell-based study (#B-17.009) revealed that FTY720 appears to be the most potent inducer of

Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whereas ACT-128800 was about 50-fold less potent and the natural ligand S1P 
was 200-fold less potent when cells were stimulated for 10 minutes with the respective compound. When 
cells were continuously exposed to ACT-128800 Erk1/2 signalling could not be elicited via S1P or ACT-
135364  (a  close  ponesimod  analogue)  suggesting  that  chronic  ACT-128800  exposure  makes  cells 
refractive for further S1P1 stimulation. This was confirmed by detection of lower S1P1 protein levels in 
cells exposed to ACT-128800 over three days. This effect was observed irrespective of removal of ACT-
128800 after three days. When cells were allowed to recover for 24 hours after 24 hours incubation with 
ACT-128800 a full recovery of the S1P1 expression was observed.  
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that chronic ACT-128800 exposure makes cells 
unresponsive to further stimulation by receptor internalisation and does not lead to permanent 
signalling. 
In vivo 
Single oral administration of ACT-128800 (3, 10, 30, 100 mg/kg; n=6/dose group; Study #B-05.053) 
reduced  lymphocyte  levels  in  rats  in  a  time-  and  dose-dependent  manner.  The  maximal  reduction  in 
lymphocyte levels was achieved at a plasma concentration of 70 ng/ml in rats and occurred at 3 and 6 
hours at the lowest dose level. The duration of the lymphocyte reducing effect very well correlated with 
the dose administered, i.e. the higher the dose, the longer lasted the effect. 
Single oral administration of 5 mg/kg ACT-128800 to conscious beagle dogs (Study #B-05.126) resulted 
in a reduction in lymphocyte counts from baseline ranging from 39–58% after 4 hours and 52–70% after 
24  hours.  Recovery  of  lymphocyte  counts  appeared  to  depend  on  the  administered  dose  and,  as  a 
consequence, on plasma levels of ACT-128800. 
In  CD-1  mice  repeated  oral  administration  of  ACT-128800  for  5  days  (Study#  B-17.008)  reduced 
circulating lymphocyte counts with a peak effect at 2 and 6 hours after the last oral administration to a 
level  of  1000-1400  lymphocytes/μL  (mean  values  of  n  =  4-5)  at  all  doses  tested  (50,  150,  and  400 
mg/kg). In the vehicle group mean values at d0 (baseline), 2h, 6h, and 24h after last administration 
were 7.2, 4.2, 5.0 and 5.0 x 103 cells/µl. Moreover, it was noted that the effect on lymphocyte counts 
exerted  by  ACT-128800  was  not  dependent  on  dose  and  plasma-levels,  respectively,  as  group  mean 
values after the last administration of 10, 150 and 400 mg/kg were 1.0, 1.4 and 1.2 x 103 cells/µl after 
2h and 1.4, 1.0 and 1.1 x 103 cells/µl after 6h. This suggests that the maximal pharmacological effect 
was  already  achieved  at  the  lowest  dose  of  10  mg/kg/day.  After  recovery  at  24h  after  the  last 
administration of 10, 150, and 400 mg/kg mean lymphocyte counts were 6.9, 6.1 and 4.2 x 103 cells/µl, 
respectively. A dose-effect on the recovery of lymphocyte counts cannot be ruled out from these data.  
The  effect  of  ACT-128800  on  the  reduction  of  lymphocyte  subsets  was  investigated  after  repeated 
administration of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg over 7 days in rats. Lymphocyte subsets especially prone to S1P1-
mediated reduction were naïve CD4+ and CD8+ cells as well as γδ T-cells and Natural Killer T (NKT). 
Natural Killer (NK) cells and monocytes were hardly reduced upon ACT-128800 treatment. Only slight 
variation with regard recovery was observed between the investigated lymphocyte subsets, i.e. αβ T-
cells, γδ T-cells, B cells, NK cells and NKT cells, as well as monocytes. NKT cells, however, appeared to 
return  to  baseline  more  rapidly.  FTY720  reduced  all  lymphocyte  subsets  to  a  similar  extent  as  ACT-
128800. However, in contrast to ACT-128800, lymphocyte reduction and, thus, the return to baseline 
was prolonged in FTY720 treated animals. 
The  therapeutic  efficacy  of  ACT-128800  was  investigated  in  a  murine  Experimental  Autoimmune 
Encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  model  (Study  #B-08.460),  in  which  mice  were  immunised  with  a  peptide 
derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) together with strong bacterial adjuvants and 
pertussis  vaccine  to  generate  a  MS-like  condition.  Treatment  with  30  mg/kg  twice  a  day  (BID)  ACT-
128800 for 23 days starting on day 1 after induction of the disease resulted in the suppression of clinical 
Assessment report

Page 22/136 
 
  
 
 
signs  of  the  disease  also  throughout  the  7-day  treatment-free  follow  up  period.  Less  effectivity  was 
observed when treatment was started with 6 mg/kg BID only 6 days after immunisation. In an additional 
subset of animals, treatment with 30 mg/kg BID was only started on day 15 after immunisation when 
animals  already  displayed  clinical  signs  of  the  disease.  In  the  31  day-experiment,  mice  continuously 
treated  with  ponesimod  30  mg/kg  BID  from  day  1–31  showed  90%  survival,  and  mice  in  which  the 
treatment with ponesimod was started only on Day 15, showed survival rate of 60% on day 31, however, 
clear clinical signs of paralysis were apparent in both groups as shown by decrease in clinical score from 
4 in untreated mice to 3 in ponesimod treated mice. The histology on brain and spinal cord tissues clearly 
demonstrate  decreased  mononuclear  cell  infiltrate  in  ponesimod  30  mg/kg  bid  treated  mice.  The 
applicant was expected to discuss the development of paralysis in ponesimod bid treated EAE mice in 
the absence of CNS inflammation. The applicant explained that the representative CNS histology data 
shown  in  the  report  B-08-460  were  derived  from  a  30-day  preventive  experiment  (Exp A  and  Exp  B) 
where ponesimod was administered at 30 mg/kg bid orally, starting on Day 1 after immunisation with 
MOG peptide (prevention study). In a 31-day treatment study, mice treated with ponesimod from Days 
1–31  showed  90%  survival,  whereas  survival  rate  was  60%  in  mice  treated  after  clear  onset  of  EAE 
symptoms,  starting  from  day  15.  Clinical  severity  was  clearly  worse  in  the  31-day  (treatment) 
experiment,  in  comparison  to  the  preventive  30-day  experiment.  Since  histology  analysis  of  CNS 
pathology from a 31-day treatment experiment was not performed, the influx of the immune cells in the 
CNS cannot be established as a cause of the paralysis. Nevertheless, the results from the EAE mouse 
model indicate that the administration of ponesimod slows down the disease progression and increases 
survival rate in the mice that received ponesimod comparing to the vehicle-treated animals. 
ACT-128800 treatment was capable of slowing disease progression and increasing survival in these mice 
as compared to vehicle-treatment but was not as effective as treatment starting before the development 
of  clinical  signs.  Histological  analysis  revealed  protection  against  axonal  damage  or  loss.  Anti-MOG 
antibodies were still present after ACT-128800 treatment also indicating other pathomechanisms apart 
from antibody-mediated disease involved in EAE. Antigen-specific T-cells were detectable in spleens of 
animals  of  all  treatment  or  vehicle  groups.  However,  the  proliferation  of  MOG-antigen-specific  T-cells 
was diminished to a certain extent ex vivo when incubated with ACT-128800. The applicant concluded 
that,  because  ACT-128800  did  not  prevent  the  formation  of  MOG  peptide-specific  T  cell  clones,  a 
reduction in the trafficking of MOG-reactive T-cells to the CNS might occur.   
The  hypothesis  that  ACT-128800  regulates  the  circulation  of  T-lymphocyte  trafficking  between  blood, 
lymphatic system and non-lymphoid tissues was evaluated in a delayed-type hypersensitivity model in 
mice. Skin inflammation was induced by topical administration of dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and ACT-
128800 was administered orally (30 mg/kg) before (19 and 3 hours) sensitisation and for further 8 days 
thereafter (1g/kg food). Inflammatory parameters (ear oedema, recruitment of neutrophils to the skin 
and protein extravasation in the ear skin) were reduced by 60 to 91% in the ACT-128800 treated group 
as compared to vehicle. 
The efficacy of ACT-128800 was evaluated in an additional T-cell mediated inflammation model in rats, 
i.e.  adjuvant-induced  arthritis  (AIA).  AIA  was  induced  by  intradermal  injection  of  0.1  mL  Complete 
Freund’s  adjuvant  (CFA;  6  mg  heat-inactivated  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  H37  RA  in  1  mL  liquid 
paraffin Freund’s adjuvant incomplete). Mice were treated orally with ACT-128800 starting from day 0 
of disease induction through 16 days with 1 or 6 mg/kg BID or 0.3 mg/kg FTY720 once a day (QD). A 
dose-dependent pharmacological effect could be observed whereby the 6 mg/kg dose efficiently delayed 
onset and reduced the development of clinical signs of the disease. A clear amelioration of the symptoms 
was achieved with 1 mg/kg as compared to the vehicle group. Correspondingly, peripheral lymphocyte 
counts were reduced in a dose-dependent manner.

In a second experimental setting, animals were treated with 30 mg/kg ACT-128800 and inoculated with 
CFA  three  hours  thereafter.  A  second  oral  dose  was  given  9h  after  the  first  dose.  In  addition,  feed 
supplemented with ACT-128800 (1 g/kg) was administered to animals for an additional 18 days. For the 
first  week  of  the  experiment,  no  difference  in  inflammation  marker  levels  was  observed  between 
treatment and vehicle groups. According to the applicant, this observation can be explained by an acute 
inflammatory  reaction  at  the  injection  site.  Starting  from  day  14,  a  clear  reduction  of  inflammation 
markers  (c-reactive  protein  [CRP]  and  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  [ESR])  were  observed  in  ACT-
128800  treated  mice  as  compared  to  the  vehicle  group.  In  addition,  significantly  lower  levels  of  pro-
inflammatory cytokines (human growth-regulated oncogene/ Keratinocyte chemoattractant [GRO/KC], 
Interleukin  [IL]-1ß,  IL-6,  IL-12(P70),  IL-17,  IL-18,  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1  [MCP-1], 
macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1α], regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed 
and presumably secreted [RANTES]), as well as the bone erosion marker receptor activator of nuclear 
factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), were detected in ACT-128800-treated animals in comparison to animals 
administered with vehicle. 
The  PD  effect  of  ACT-128800  was  further  evaluated  in  MRL/lpr  mice  that  spontaneously  develop  a 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease. SLE is a T- and B-cell driven disorder. MRL/lpr mice 
develop serum autoantibodies at 6 weeks of age and lymphadenopathy at 12 weeks (Liu et al., 2006). 
The  disease  is  mediated  by  the  emergence  of  an  unusual  population  of  B220+CD4negCD8neg  T  cells 
(double negative). Mice develop progressive renal disease, including heavy proteinuria by 16 weeks of 
age  and  50%  die  at  20  weeks.  Other  morbidities  observed 
include  progressive 
lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly,  hypergammaglobulinemia,  autoantibody  production  (e.g.  anti-DNA), 
immunocomplex  formation  and  multiple  organ  alteration,  e.g.  vasculitis,  arthritis  and  fatal 
glomerulonephritis. Generally, MRL/lpr mice do not survive longer than 28 weeks. 
Mice were treated with ACT-128800 starting from 12 days of age for 12 weeks. Treatment was initiated 
with oral gavage of 30 mg/kg for one day and maintained by food mixed with ACT-128800 (1 g/kg food). 
Clinical scores were determined for skin lesions, arthritis, lymphadenopathy and body weight. In addition, 
analysis  for  proteinuria  and  albuminuria  was  performed.  Plasma  was  analysed  for  cytokines, 
immunoglobulin  isotypes,  anti-DNA  antibodies  and  B  cell-activating  factor  (BAFF).  Splenocytes  and 
lymph node cells were analysed by flow cytometry to determine B- and T-cell subsets. Histopathological 
analysis of kidneys was performed in order to detect abnormalities.  
Mice did not develop notable signs of arthritis and skin lesions in this study. The increase of the albumin 
to  creatinine  ratio  was  delayed  and  suppressed  in  ACT-128800  treated  animals  as  compared  to  the 
vehicle group. Nephropathy and glomerulonephritis appeared less severe in animals that received ACT-
128800. Lymphoproliferation in secondary lymphoid organs, i.e. lymph nodes and spleen, was reduced 
by ACT-128800 and all investigated lymphocyte subsets were decreased in blood but not in lymph nodes. 
No effect on auto-antibodies was exerted by ACT-128800, but IgA and BAFF were found to be decreased. 
Except for a small decrease of plasma Interferon gamma-inducible protein (IP-10) no effect on cytokines 
was observed. Survival was not significantly prolonged by ACT-128800 as compared to the vehicle group. 
Thus,  ACT-128800  showed  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  development  of  the  SLE-like  disease  in  MRL/lpr 
mice,  that  was  in  particular  apparent  in  the  prevention  of  kidney  disease,  lymphadenopathy  and 
circulating lymphocytes.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Interaction of ACT-128800 with a comprehensive panel of 107 protein-coupled receptors, enzymes, ion 
channels and transporter proteins was evaluated by radioligand-binding or activity assays (Study #B-
05.112). Weak effects were only observed with the endothelin receptor type A (ETA), monoamine oxidase

(MAO)-B,  and  protein  serine/threonine  kinase  (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent  II)  at  a  relatively  high 
concentration of 10 µM as compared to a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) in the GTPγS assay. 
The effects are therefore considered not relevant for therapeutic concentrations of ACT-128800. 
The effect of ACT-128800 on the course of and the immune response to an infection was tested in mice 
infected with L. monocytogenes (Study #B-17.048). Mice were infected with 1 x 103 colony-forming unit 
(CFU)/animal at day 0. Treatment with ACT-128800 started on day -1 with an oral dose of 100 mg/kg 
BID and was continued until day 9 post-infection. On day 3 after infection relative proportions of CD4+, 
CD8+ and B220+ peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were comparable in ACT-128800- and vehicle-
treated animals. CFUs isolated on days 2, 6 and 10 from spleens, kidneys, livers and lungs of infected 
animals treated with ACT-128800 and vehicle revealed a similar course of infection in animals with or 
without treatment with ACT-128800.  
Essentially,  the  risk  of  a  difficult  progression  of  bacterial  infections  under  ACT-128800  treatment  is 
considered low. This is in line with clinical observations made with a nonselective SP1 modulator.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
For the elucidation of potential effects on the cardiovascular system, the capability of ACT-128800 and 
its major metabolite M13 to cause QT-prolongations was investigated in in vitro human ether-à-go-go 
related gene (hERG)-channel assays (Studies #T-04.092 and B-10.608). Both compounds were found 
to  be  weak  inhibitors  of  the  hERG-mediated  potassium  current  with  an  20%  inhibitory  concentration 
(IC20) of 3 µM or 5-8 µM, respectively. ACT-128800 and M13 were tested independently in two separate 
studies that employed different cell lines, stimulation protocols and positive controls; nevertheless, no 
concerns with regard to potential QT-prolongations exist. 
A  dose-related  increase  in  the  HR  (heart  rate),  which  regressed  after  repeated  administration  was 
observed  in  patients  treated  with  ACT-128800.  As  no  such  findings  were  made  in  rat  and  dog  safety 
pharmacology  studies,  a  possible  direct  (as  opposed  to  indirect  through  neural  control  of  the  HR) 
influence of ACT-128800 on the firing rate of isolated sinus node preparations of different species (male 
and female Wistar rats, male guinea pigs and female New Zealand white rabbits) was investigated (Study 
#B-08.043).  No  increased  in  the  firing  rate  was  observed  at  concentrations  of  up  to  10  µM  largely 
precluding a direct influence of ACT-128800 on the HR. 
In terms of investigating vascular effects of ACT-128800 a set of in vitro experiments was performed 
with different types of arteries derived from dogs, rats and human patients. ACT-128800 mediated low 
contraction in rat basilar arteries when the endothelium was intact and a more pronounced contraction 
when the endothelium had been removed (Study #B-05.081). Similar observations were made with S1P. 
Pre-treatment with an S1P3 antagonist inhibited S1P-mediated contraction. In contrast, ACT-128800 had 
a relaxing effect on pre-contracted rat aorta. These observations were explained by the applicant by the 
high ratio of S1P3 to S1P1 in rat arteries, whereas the ratio is the other way around in the rat aorta.  
An  additional  ex  vivo  experiment  was  conducted  to  investigate  species  differences  in  the  contractile 
properties  of  ACT-128800  on  arteries  (Study  #B-08.456).  Mesenteric  arteries  from  rats  and  dogs 
differently  reacted  to  ACT-128800  exposure:  whereas  no  contraction  was  observed  in  rat  mesenteric 
arteries at concentrations of up to 1 µM, dog mesenteric arteries already contracted at an exposure to a 
100  nM  ACT-128800  solution.  From  these  results,  a  differential  effect  of  ACT-128800  on  the  blood 
pressure (BP) in rats and dogs, as observed in in vivo studies, would be conceivable. In contrast to ACT-
128800, mesenteric arteries from both rats and dogs, were highly responsive to pFTY720.  
In order to investigate the sensitivity of dog coronary arteries to ACT-128800-mediated contraction, a 
comparative experiment with rat coronary arteries was conducted (Study #B-08.069). Selective blocking

of  S1P3  revealed  that  contraction  in  dog  arteries  is  mediated  by  S1P3  receptor  binding.  Activation  of 
S1P1, in contrast, counteracted the contraction of dog arteries. Moreover, it was found that injury of the 
endothelium augments the contractile effect on canine arteries. On the molecular level, it was revealed 
that the species difference with regard to ACT-128800 mediated contractility is established by a different 
expression  pattern  of  S1P1  and  S1P3.  Thus,  dog  arteries  express  predominantly  S1P3  messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA),  whereas rat  arteries highly express S1P1 mRNA. In in vitro PD  studies ACT-
128800 was found to have a 5-fold reduced potency on rat S1P3 receptor as compared to the human 
counterpart.  Nevertheless,  the  rat  is  considered  a  relevant  species  for  the  evaluation  of  the  safety  of 
ACT-128800. This is based on the one hand on the complexity of the actual physiological response of 
S1P3 signalling as compared to in vitro studies and on the other hand on the totality of data that have 
been generated in vivo and ex vivo in various species. 
Arteries  isolated  from  rats  treated  with  ACT-128800  or  fingolimod  for  four  weeks  did  not  show  any 
differences in response to various vasoconstrictors as compared to vehicle-treated animals, indicating 
no persistent change induced by ACT-128800. 
Finally, arterial rings (left anterior descending, right coronary artery and internal mammary artery) from 
six patients were investigated with regard to responsiveness to ACT-128800 induced contraction (Study 
#B-08.457). Human arterial rings responded only minimally to a concentration of 100 nM ACT-128800, 
which corresponds to the available amount of free compound in vivo. Supra-therapeutic concentrations 
of 1 µM ACT-128800 triggered a contraction in human arteries. The expression profile of S1P1 and S1P3 
mRNA was similar in both coronary and internal mammary arteries. Thus, from the ex vivo data provided 
for human arteries, it can be deduced that ACT-128800 does not have a vasoconstrictive effect on human 
arteries at therapeutic concentrations. However, it has to be noted that the endothelium appeared not 
to  be  functional  in  all  of  the  human  preparations  as  they  were  derived  from  surgery  of  patients  with 
coronary disease and there was a longer time lag between excision and ex vivo evaluation negatively 
affecting the function of the epithelium.  
The in vivo effect of ACT-128800 on the cardiovascular system was investigated in a series of studies: 
Single oral administration of doses of up to 600 mg/kg (corresponds to a plasma exposure of 3.7 μg/mL) 
did not result in changes of the HR or of mean arterial BP in comparison to vehicle when observed for 
24 hours after treatment (Study #B-08.461). 
Repeated daily administration of 30 mg/kg/day ACT-128800 or 1 mg/kg/day FTY720 lead to a late-onset 
or immediate increase in mean arterial BP but did not affect HR (Study #B-16.016). The low doses of 10 
mg/kg/day ACT-128800 or 0.3 mg/kg/day FTY720 did not have any effect on BP. Lung weights dose-
dependently  increased  under  ACT-128800  and  FTY720  treatment  for  20%  -  65%  and  24%  -  47%, 
respectively. Neither compound had an influence on the heart weights. Lymphocyte counts were similarly 
reduced in both ACT-128800 and FTY720 treated animals. 
Two studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats revealed that a single dose of 100 mg/kg (corresponding 
to a plasma concentration of 1000 ng/ml) did not have an effect on the BP or HR when administered in 
the  morning  (Study  #B-05.054).  Upon  evening  administration,  thus,  before  the  activity  phase  of  the 
animals,  still  no  effect  on  BP  was  observed  but  the  normal  increase  of  the  HR  at  that  time  was  less 
pronounced  with  100  mg/kg  (Study  #B-07.401).  FTY720,  on  the  other  hand,  increased  the  BP  and 
decreased  the  HR  of  normotensive  and  spontaneous  hypertensive  animals  starting  from  doses  of  3 
mg/kg. 
A reduction of HR and, occasionally, AV block type II, Wenckebach has been reported in patients treated 
with FTY720. ACT-128800 was also found to affect HR and rhythm in healthy human subjects. These 
effects  were  largely  limited  to  day  1  of  treatment.  For  further  investigation  of  this  observation, 
cardiovascular  parameters  in  response  to  ACT-128800  treatment  were  investigated  in  conscious

telemetered  Guinea  pigs  (Study  #B-  08.040).  A  single  administration  of  0.1  mg/kg  did  not  have  any 
effect.  However,  0.3  mg/kg  induced  AV  Block  type  III  in  one  animal  and  3  mg/kg  in  all  animals.  A 
transient decrease in BP was observed at doses starting from 1 mg/kg. When repeated doses of 1 or 3 
mg/kg were administered, desensitisation was observed so that the second administered dose did elicit 
considerably weaker effects than the first dose. Effects evoked by the first dose were AV block II, Mobitz 
II and AV block type III. It was observed that the effects of the second dose were largely dependent on 
the plasma concentration at the time point of the second administration, i.e. it was more pronounced 
when  plasma  concentrations  had  already  declined  again.  It  was  further  discovered  that  a  gradual 
increase of the dose, starting with very low doses of 0.1 mg/kg could largely prevent the occurrence of 
AV blocks.  
A  dose-dependent  effect  of  ACT-128800  on  cardiac  parameters  was  also  observed  in  anaesthetised 
guinea pigs that were administered via infusion (Study #B-08.041). The effects, i.e. AV blocks type I, II 
and III, were apparent, starting from doses of 0.03 mg/kg administered over 20 minutes and lasted for 
20-35 minutes. ACT-128800 induced  cardiac effect could be reversed by β-adrenoceptor agonists but 
not by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. 
Guinea pigs appear to be more sensitive to ACT-128800 as compared to rats as effects on the BP, and 
HR were already observed at single-doses of 1 mg/kg whereas in rats no effects were observed after 
single doses of up to 600 mg/kg. Moreover, upon repeated administration of ACT-128800 rats and dogs 
developed an increased BP, whereas the BP decreased in guinea pigs in response to ACT-128800. Also, 
no effect on the HR was observed at any dose in rats and dogs. However, integrating the effects observed 
in  humans,  rats  and  guinea  pigs  renders  guinea  pigs  a  relevant  species  for  the  investigation  of 
cardiovascular effects of ACT-128800 despite higher sensitivity. 
As  an  additional  species  for  the  investigation  of  potential  effects  on  cardiac  function,  telemetered 
conscious  beagle  dogs  were  administered  with  single  doses  of  0.6,  1.4  and  4  mg/kg  ACT-128800  by 
infusion  over  30  minutes  (good  laboratory  practice  [GLP];  Study  #T-05.047).  No  effects  on 
electrocardiogram  (ECG),  HR  or  BP  were  observed  so  that  the  no  observed  effect  level  (NOEL)  on 
cardiovascular parameters was determined at 4 mg/kg intravenous administration. Oral administration 
of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg resulted in a transient increase in BP in some animals starting at a dose of 30 
mg/kg. HR, electrocardiographic parameters, respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, tidal volume and 
minute volume) and locomotor activity were not affected at any dose administered. The oral NOEL for 
ACT-128800 was therefore set at 10 mg/kg. 
Daily  administration  of  40  mg/kg  ACT-128800  for  four  weeks  to  telemetered  Beagle  dogs  lead  to  a 
significant daily increase in systolic (SPB) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mainly up to 2 hours after 
administration (GLP; Study #T-07.185). The increase of the BP correlated with plasma levels of ACT-
128800 and was most pronounced after the first treatment. This finding is in line with the desensitisation 
to  ACT-128800-related  effects  observed  in  guinea  pigs.  HR  and  the  general  health  status,  as  well  as 
body weight (BW) and food consumption, were not influenced by ACT-128800 treatment. After the in 
vivo observation period, large coronary arteries, their smaller branches, and the interventricular septum 
were  subjected  to  S1P1  and  S1P3  gene  expression  analysis.  No  statistically  significant  difference  was 
observed in regard to S1P1 expression in all tissues investigated. S1P3, in contrast, was higher expressed 
in  large  coronary  arteries  and  the  interventricular  septum  as  compared  to  the  arterial  branches.  No 
influence of ACT-128800 on the receptor expression pattern was observed. 
Finally, the effects of ACT-128800 on both cardiac and peripheral vascular areas were investigated in an 
open-chest  model  of  anaesthetised  dogs  (GLP;  Study  #T-07.245).  ACT-128800  was  administered  at 
doses of  0.6, 1.4, 4 and  8 mg/kg/30  min at 4 increasing rates  of infusion of 0.12, 0.28,  0.8 and  1.6 
mL/kg over 30-minute periods. A dose-dependent hypertensive effect was observed starting from doses

Page 27/136 
 
  
 
 
of 1.4 mg/kg. The observed effect was found to be related to a vasoconstrictive action of ACT-128800 
on peripheral vascular areas. 
In vivo assessment of effects mediated on the respiratory system of rats by whole-body plethysmography 
revealed  that  ACT-128800  statistically  significantly  increased  Penh  values  after  a  single  dose  of  100 
mg/kg  3  and  6  hours  after  administration  (GLP,  Study  #B-05.090)  and  was  only  observed  when  the 
plasma concentration of ACT-128800 was approx. 3800 ng/mL or higher. In contrast, FTY720 lead to a 
statistically  significant  increase  of  Penh  at  a  dose  of  10  mg/kg  at  3,  6  and  24  hours  after  treatment. 
Analysis of individual respiratory parameters revealed that the increase in Penh is most likely caused by 
a decrease in the relaxation time. 
Similarly, in a GLP-compliant 4-week oral administration (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) study including a two-
week recovery period (Study #T-06.047), the main effects observed were a dose-dependent statistically 
significant  increase  in  peak  expiratory  flow  and  enhanced  Penh  after  the  first  administration.  These 
effects were still noted after two weeks of consecutive treatment. However, the effect was higher in the 
10 mg/kg dose group. This increase in Penh was not considered as a signal for bronchoconstriction but 
rather as resulting from a more than proportional increase in peak expiratory flow (PEF) compared to 
peak inspiratory flow (PIF). After four weeks of treatment and the recovery period, no more effects on 
respiratory  parameters  were  noted.  Histopathologic  examination  after  the  recovery  period  revealed 
alveolar histiocytosis in both dose groups and alveolar hyalinosis in one out of eight animals. Moreover, 
dose-dependent  perivascular  lymphoid  cell  infiltration  was  noted  in  all  groups,  including  controls.  No 
other treatment-related events were detected.  
Vascular permeability in response to single or repeated oral dosing for 14 days of up to 100 mg/kg ACT-
128800  was  assessed  in  rats  (Study  #B-09.392).  Evans  blue  was  used  as  a  marker  for  vascular 
permeability. For single dosing, an increase in permeability was observed starting from doses of 1 mg/kg 
with  a  maximum  effect  3-7h  after  administration  and  full  reversibility  within  24  hours.  Maximal 
permeability  was  noted  at  4  mg/kg  with  no  further  increase  of  the  effect  with  increased  doses.  No 
increase in lung permeability was observed upon chronic treatment with 10 or 100 mg/kg/day. However, 
a time-dependent decrease in lung permeability could be detected in the second week of treatment as 
compared to the first administration. In contrast, the weight of the lungs increased in a dose-dependent 
manner  and  persisted  throughout  the  treatment  period.  Thus,  the  lung  seems  to  adapt  to  chronic 
administration of ACT-128800. 
In  order  to  investigate  the  mechanism  behind  the  alveolar  histiocytosis,  increase  in  lung  weights  and 
hyperplasia a study with single and multiple (for seven days) administration of 100 mg/kg ACT-128800 
was  conducted  in  rats  (Study  #B-09.073).  In  detail,  the  hypothesis  was  that  ACT-128800  increases 
vascular permeability and results in leakage of liquid and plasma proteins to the lung interstitium, which 
in turn attracts alveolar macrophages for clearance. Lung weights were increased starting from day 1 
after administration, and no further increase in lung weights was observed from day 3 until the end of 
the treatment period at day 7. Histopathologic investigation revealed distension of perivascular spaces 
containing macrophages and eosinophils in animals treated with ACT-128800. The distension was most 
pronounced 3 to 10 hours after treatment and decreased again at 24 hours. In addition, the expansion 
appeared  to  be  more  distinct  after  single  treatment  than  after  seven  treatments,  whereas  alveolar 
macrophages  were  only  present  after  seven  treatments.  Administration  of  FITC-labelled  albumin  15 
minutes prior to termination of the experiment revealed leakage of the marker to the perivascular space 
and uptake by perivascular macrophages in ACT-128800 treated animals. In contrast, no fluorescence 
signal  was  detected  in  the  alveolar  space  or  in  alveolar  macrophages.  Minimal  increased  alveolar 
histiocytosis became apparent after 7 days. Overall, lungs appeared to adapt to ACT-128800 in terms of 
reduction  of  interstitial  oedema  upon  prolonged  treatment  and  no  effect  on  airways  was  established 
under the experimental conditions.

In  addition  to  standard  safety  pharmacology  investigation  of  the  respiratory  system,  mechanistic 
investigations  were  triggered  by  observations  of  alveolar  histiocytosis  in  rats  and  dogs  at  doses  ≥  10 
mg/kg/day  for  4  weeks  and  occasional  cases  of  dyspnoea  observed  during  clinical  studies.  The 
involvement  of  S1P  in  airway  function  has  been  initially  assumed  when  bronchoalveolar  lavage  of 
asthmatic patients was found to contain increased levels of S1P as compared to healthy patients (Ammit 
et  al.,  2001).  S1P  mainly  acts  on  airway  smooth  muscle  cell  contraction  as  well  as  proliferation  and 
overall promotes a Th2 response and, thus, allergic disease (Ryann et al., 2008).  
Exposure of different sections of rat tracheae to ACT-128800 (Study #B-05.080) in a protein-free buffer 
system  revealed  that  ACT-128800  contracted  both,  upper  and  lower  segments,  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner at concentrations of 100 nM and 1 µM. ACT-128800-mediated effects were inhibited by addition 
of  an  S1P3  antagonist,  whereas  no  change  in  contraction  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  an  S1P1 
antagonist.  The  results  suggest  that  ACT-128800  induces  tracheal  contraction  via  S1P3  receptors.  Of 
note, the applicant argues that due to the high protein-binding property of ACT-128800 sufficiently high 
concentrations to mediate this effect also in vivo are very unlikely to be achieved upon therapeutic doses. 
In a second study on isolated rat tracheae, it was found that ACT-128800 at a concentration of 100 nM 
induces predominantly in the lower tracheal segment and not in the upper segment (Study #B-08.458). 
Receptor mRNA analysis revealed that S1P1 and S1P3 mRNA was equally expressed in the upper tracheal 
part, whereas a clearly higher expression of S1P3 mRNA was detected in the lower part. These results 
confirm that ACT-128800 mediates its contractile effect on tracheae via the S1P3. 
Ex vivo studies on isolated human bronchi (Study #B-16.031) demonstrated that ACT-128800 is able to 
induce contraction at all concentrations tested, starting from 0.03 nM. 
Potential effects of ACT-128800 on the CNS were investigated in a GLP-compliant modified Irwin screen 
in Wistar rats. A significant decrease of animals showing an increased pain response after 2 hours after 
dosing  (30  mg/kg),  as  well  as  non-significantly  increased  vocaliaation  (10  and  30  mg/kg),  were 
observed. As these findings were not dose-dependent and also found in control animals ACT-128800 was 
concluded to not have effects on the CNS. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Not provided by the applicant. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant conducted an extensive non-clinical programme to assess the PK of ponesimod. Validated 
analytical techniques were used to determine pharmacokinetic endpoints in these studies. 
The  bioanalytical  method  used  for  non-clinical  PK  evaluations  was  liquid  chromatography  coupled  to 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Method validation reports for the analysis of ponesimod in the plasma 
of the various animal species used in the submitted development programme were provided and were 
considered  acceptable.  In  addition  to  LC-MS/MS,  studies  were  also  conducted  with  radiolabelled 
ponesimod  ([14C]ponesimod)  and  M13  (tritium-labelled,  [3H]M13).  Sufficient  description  of  the 
radiochemical methods used in non-clinical PK studies (liquid scintillation counting (LSC), quantitative 
whole-body autoradiography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with in-line radioactivity 
detection or coupled with fraction collection and LSC) were provided in the respective study reports.  
Non-specific  binding  of  ponesimod  and  its  metabolites  to  plastics  was  demonstrated  and  described  in 
selected in vitro studies (e.g. Study FK13518, FK13542). The recoveries of the added concentrations in 
these studies were consequently low and only matched the targeted concentrations when non-specific

Page 29/136 
 
  
 
 
binding to plastics was corrected. As in vitro studies constitute a pivotal contribution to the non-clinical 
assessment of pharmaceuticals (especially PD and PK, but also toxicity endpoints such as genotoxicity), 
the applicant was invited to provide information whether loss of ponesimod and its metabolites via non-
specific  binding  to  plastic  laboratory  utensils  and  lab  consumables  was  consistently  evaluated  and 
considered in the conduct and evaluation of in vitro studies. The applicant provided a concise discussion 
that demonstrated that binding of ponesimod to plastic ware did not impact the gathered in vitro results 
to a relevant extent. 
Non-dose  proportionality  was  frequently  observed  in  many  of  the  animal  studies  conducted  with 
ponesimod,  whereby  less  than  dose  proportionality,  but  also  greater  than  dose  proportionality  were 
observed. Upon request, the applicant described that non dose-proportionality in rats was presumably 
related to saturation of clearance at high doses, and in dogs to food intake. Furthermore, the applicant 
described that the non-dose proportionality in animals was not observed in humans. 
Absorption  was  assessed  in  designated  studies,  and  in  toxicokinetic  evaluations  of  toxicity  studies. 
Regarding  the  former,  the  applicant  studied  in  vitro  permeability  and  transepithelial  transport  of 
ponesimod in the Caco-2 model (Study B-05.105, DD19014 and FK13518). Furthermore, absorption was 
studied  in  a  preliminary  single  administration  study  in  rats  and  dogs  (Study  B-05.074).  Finally, 
absorption  was  investigated  in  the  various  toxicokinetic  assessments  included  in  toxicity  studies.  A 
separate  study,  however,  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  toxicokinetics  of  the  two  most  prominent 
metabolites of ponesimod, M12 and M13 in rats, dogs and mice (Study B-10.471). Time at maximum 
plasma concentration (tmax) of both metabolites was reached within hours (faster in rats than dogs), and 
maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from time 
0 to infinity with extrapolation of the terminal phase (AUCinf) were similar in the fed and fasted state.  
The non-clinical absorption studies indicated that ponesimod demonstrated moderate permeability and 
was not subject to efflux in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model, suggesting good absorption in the human 
intestine.  In  male  rats  and  dogs,  clearance  did  not  exceed  one-third  of  liver  blood  flow,  volume  of 
distribution  at  steady  state  (Vdss)  exceeded  total  body  water,  and  t1/2  was  faster  in  rats  than  dogs. 
Females generally demonstrated higher systemic ponesimod exposures (and had lower clearance and 
longer elimination half-lives [t1/2’s]). Oral bioavailability was 35-53% in male rats, 61% in female rats, 
and 57-74% in male dogs. 
Distribution was studied by in vivo, and in vitro approaches in six studies. At first, the applicant studied 
tissue  biodistribution  in  the  male  rat  by  quantitative  whole-body  autoradiography  (Study  B-06.066). 
Tissue biodistribution in rats was also studied in the frame of in vivo metabolism and excretion studies 
in rats (see below). Then, the applicant investigated in vitro binding to plasma proteins and plasma/blood 
cell partitioning in rat, dog (the two main non-clinical species) and man (Study B-05.075, B-11.175 and 
B-12.195), and binding of ponesimod to human albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Study FK13292). 
Finally, the applicant studied the binding of ponesimod to rat liver homogenate (Study FK13291). The 
placental transfer was assessed in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (discussed further 
below).  
The results of the submitted distribution studies suggest that ponesimod is widely distributed into most 
rat tissues (including the brain) and concentrations in blood were generally lower than those in tissues. 
Tissue  distribution  of  radioactivity  in  pigmented  rats  was  slightly  higher  (~3x)  as  compared  to 
corresponding  tissues  in  albino  rats.  Plasma  protein  binding  of  ponesimod  and  M13  was  high  (98.9-
99.6%  and  99.0-99.6%,  respectively)  and  concentration-independent  in  human  and  animal  species. 
Uptake into blood cells was low. 
In the rat whole-body autoradiography study, ponesimod was found to bind to pigmented tissues (uveal 
tract, nasal mucosa and skin) (Study B-06.066). Ponesimod concentrations in pigmented rats’ skin and 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 30/136 
 
  
 
 
nasal  mucosa  increased  from  day  1  to  day  7  of  the  study  (106  vs  66  ng/g  and  25  vs  30  ng/g, 
respectively). Apart from skin and nasal mucosa, radioactivity in the pigmented rat at 7 days post-dose 
rat was also detected in more than half of the analysed tissues (24 analysed organs were positive, 20 
analysed  organs  were  negative),  including  inner  organs  (e.g.  kidney,  liver,  lungs,  blood,  testis  and 
epididymis,  adrenal  cortex,  etc.)  in  which  pigmentation  and  consequently  binding  to  melanin  is 
presumably less relevant. After 7 days post-dose in the non-pigmented rat; however, only the kidney, 
liver,  spleen  and  skin  contained  radioactivity.  The  applicant  clarified  that  distribution  into  pigmented 
tissues such as uveal tract and skin in the pigmented rat would create transient peripheral reservoirs of 
radiolabelled ponesimod, not present in the albino rat, that would then redistribute back into the blood 
and  perfuse  other  organs  during  the  elimination  phase.  This  likely  underlies  the  residual  detection  of 
radioactivity in non-pigmented tissues within the pigmented rat at Day 7. 
Ulcerations and papillary hyperplasia were found in the skin of dogs in study T-08.357. Furthermore, a 
case of malignant melanoma and two cases of basal cell carcinoma (0.4%) were reported in the OPTIMUM 
clinical study. Considering that the skin enables accumulation of ponesimod (presumably by melanin-
binding, Study B-06.066), a correlation between increased and prolonged ponesimod skin exposure and 
the skin lesions in dogs and sporadic cutaneous carcinogenesis in clinical trial participants was originally 
considered possible. However, the applicant replied to this concern that the dermal lesions reported in 
dogs  receiving  ponesimod  were  neither  preneoplastic  nor  neoplastic  and  are  not  related  to  the 
pathogenesis of the skin malignancies seen in humans receiving S1P modulators. 
Metabolism of ponesimod has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo. The chemical structures and 
quantities of metabolites in biological samples were assessed in in vivo studies with radiolabelled and 
non-radiolabelled  ponesimod.  Regarding  the  latter,  structural  elucidation  of  circulating  metabolites  of 
ponesimod was conducted by liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry 
(Study B-07.055). Studies with radiolabelled ponesimod included metabolic profiling studies in the rat 
(Study B-05.109) and in the beagle dog (Study B-06.103). In vitro metabolism studies were conducted 
to obtain cross-species comparisons of metabolic profiles. Studies with liver microsomes and hepatocytes 
from  rat,  mouse,  monkey,  dog,  minipig  and  man  were  conducted  (Study  B-05.108).  Furthermore,  a 
study was initiated to elucidate whether the metabolite M1 is a real metabolite or an artefact induced by 
ambient light (Study B-08.379). Then, the metabolic profile of ponesimod was determined in rat liver S9 
fractions  (Study  B-08.213).  Enzyme  identification  and  mechanistic  metabolic  pathway  studies  were 
conducted to identify the human enzymes (e.g. CYP450s, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases 
(UGT),  aldehyde-dehydrogenases,  aldo-keto-reductases,  prostaglandin  dehydrogenases)  involved  in 
ponesimod metabolism (Study B-18.004, FK12520, FK13537). Finally, mechanistic investigations on the 
metabolic pathways of ponesimod were conducted (Study B-16.027).  
The conducted metabolism studies suggest that prior to excretion, ponesimod is extensively metabolised 
in  vivo  in  both  rats  and  dogs  (and  humans).  Metabolism  of  ponesimod  follows  multiple  pathways, 
primarily: direct glucuronidation (catalysed mainly by UGTs 1A1 and 2B7), partially CYP450-mediated 
(CYPs 2J2, 3A4, 3A5, 4F3A, and 4F12) oxidation through a glyceraldehyde transient intermediate to form 
the  carboxylic  acid  metabolite  M12,  and  non-CYP450  mediated  oxidation  to  form  the  carboxylic  acid 
metabolite  M13.  M12  and  M13  were  detected  in  plasma,  urine,  and  bile  of  both  the  rat  and  dog.  In 
humans, M13 was the most prominent metabolite in plasma (the only metabolite circulating in human 
plasma at ≥10% of total drug-related material), and M12 constituted the most prominent metabolite in 
excreta (reaching approximately similar levels as unchanged excreted ponesimod).  
As both M12 and M13 are practically pharmacologically inactive, enzyme polymorphisms leading to an 
altered turnover of ponesimod could cause over- or under-exposure of the active parental substance. 
This  could  lead  to  either  decreased  pharmacological  efficacy  (rapid  metabolism  and  therefore  under-
exposure  of  ponesimod)  or  increased  secondary  pharmacology/exaggerated  pharmacology  (slow

metabolism  and  therefore  over-exposure  of  ponesimod).  Addressing  this  concern,  the  applicant 
concluded  that  there  is  no  evidence  from  the  conducted  in  vitro  studies  of  an  important  role  for 
polymorphic  enzymes  in  the  metabolism  of  ponesimod.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  stated  that 
ponesimod  metabolic  clearance  involves  multiple  independent  pathways,  each  with  multiple  enzymes 
contributing. Finally, the applicant argued that clinical PK features support the lack of clinically relevant 
polymorphic enzymes involved in ponesimod clearance. Considering these aspects, the potential impact 
of enzyme polymorphisms on the PK of ponesimod indeed appears negligible. 
Excretion endpoints were studied separately or included in in vivo metabolism studies in intact rats and 
bile-duct cannulated rats and dogs after single and dose oral or intravenous administration (Study B-
05.109,  B-06.103  and  B-06.003).  Excretion  of  ponesimod  in  milk  was  studied  in  the  preliminary  and 
pivotal rat PPND studies (see below). 
The  results  of  the  conducted  excretion  studies  suggest  that  hepatobiliary  excretion  of  systemic 
ponesimod prevails, whereas renal excretion represented only a minor elimination pathway in rat and 
dog both species (<10% of the dose). Some of the systemic ponesimod was also directly secreted into 
the intestines. Radioactivity associated with ponesimod exposure was also exhaled to a minimal extent 
(in the per-mill range). In rats and dogs, a limited first-pass effect is conceivable (approximately 10% 
of administered ponesimod).  
Finally,  the  applicant  carried  out  a  broad  panel  of  in  vitro  PK  drug  interaction  studies  to  investigate 
potential  enzyme  induction  and  inhibition  as  well  as  transporter  inhibition  by  ponesimod.  At  first, 
metabolism-mediated  drug  interactions  were  studied  by  assessing  the  inhibition  potential  of  human 
cytochrome  P450  and  UGT  enzymes  by  ponesimod  (Study  B-05.078,  B-13.080  and  FK13543).  Time-
dependent inhibition of CYP450 activity by ponesimod was studied for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in Study B-
08.581, and for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 2C19 in Study FK13536. Induction of drug metabolising enzymes 
by ponesimod (and M13) was studied in vitro for human cytochrome P450s (Study B-08.466 and Study 
B-17.003), and in cultured human hepatocytes (Study FK13519). Finally, the applicant studied whether 
ponesimod  and  M13  are  transporter  substrates  and/or  transporter  inhibitors.  Regarding  the  former, 
transporter-mediated  drug  interactions  by  ponesimod  (and  M13)  were  studied  on  breast  cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) in MDCKII cell lines overexpressing this transporter (Study FK13542), and on 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport (Study FK13541). 
Regarding  ponesimod  and  M13  as  transporter  inhibitors,  the  inhibition  potential  of  ponesimod  and  its 
metabolite  M13  on  the  activity  of  the  human  uptake  transporters  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OAT1,  OAT3, 
Organic Cation Transporters (OCT)1 and OCT2 and the human efflux transporters multidrug and toxic 
compound extrusion (MATE)1, MATE2K, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP was studied (Study B-14.025). 
These studies demonstrate that ponesimod had an inhibitory effect on the activity of CYPs 2C19, 2C9, 
2C8,  2D6,  2J2,  and  3A4,  with  half-maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  values  from  7.8-36  μM, 
whereas inhibition was <50% for the other isoforms at the highest tested concentration (50 μM except 
100 μM for CYP2A6). M13 inhibited the activity of CYPs 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4 in human liver microsomes, 
with respective IC50 values of 9.7, 43, and 20 μM, whereas 50% inhibition was not attained for the other 
isoforms at the highest tested concentration of 100 μM (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C19, and 2D6). Neither 
ponesimod  nor  M13  showed  evidence  for  time-dependent  inhibition  of  evaluated  CYP450s.  UGT2B7 
activity was inhibited by ponesimod and UGT1A1 activity by M13, with respective IC50 values of 17 and 
24  μM.  Based  on  a  combination  of  static  and  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  modelling,  the 
applicant  determined  that  the  observed  in  vitro  inhibition  findings  do  not  indicate  a  clinically  relevant 
inhibition  risk  for  any  of  the  CYPs  or  UGTs  evaluated.  Similarly,  enzyme  induction  by  ponesimod  was 
discussed to be unlikely at therapeutically achievable concentrations.  
BCRP and the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were inhibited by both ponesimod and 
M13.  For  renal  uptake  and  efflux  transporters,  OAT1  and  OAT3  were  inhibited  by  M13,  MATE1  by 
Assessment report

ponesimod,  and  MATE2K  by  both  ponesimod  and  M13.  Less  than  50%  inhibition  was  attained  at  the 
highest tested concentration for P-gp and MATE1 by M13, OAT1 and OAT3 by ponesimod, and OCT1 and 
OCT2  by  both  ponesimod  and  M13.  Based  on  static  modelling  and  additional  analysis,  the  applicant 
determined that the observed in vitro transporter inhibition findings do not indicate a clinically relevant 
inhibition risk for any of the transporters evaluated. 
Even though M13 is the most abundant metabolite of ponesimod in human plasma, M12 was more than 
5  times  as  abundant  as  M13  in  human  excreta.  M12  almost  even  reached  the  levels  of  unchanged 
ponesimod in human excreta. Biliary excretion of systemic ponesimod and metabolites is considerable 
higher in humans and animals than urinary excretion. Considering these points, one can assume that 
the liver experiences equal or perhaps even higher M12 than M13 concentrations. Therefore, assessing 
enzyme inhibition, enzyme induction, and transporter inhibition by M12 instead of M13 might have been 
a better choice. However, in response to this concern, the applicant cautioned that the formation and 
elimination kinetics of the metabolites of ponesimod cannot be solely understood from excreta recovery 
data and that, therefore, excretion data should not be taken as a surrogate for intrahepatocellular drug 
and  metabolite  concentrations.  The  applicant  substantiated  this  statement  by  the  radio  profile  of 
[14C]ponesimod metabolites in the rat bile, which demonstrated equal biliary M12 and M13 levels. 
Originally it was not clear whether inhibition of CYP2J2 could decrease turnover rates (and subsequently 
decrease  excretion  rates)  of  the  pharmacologically  active  ponesimod  into  the  pharmacologically  less-
active  M12.  A  lower  turnover  of  ponesimod  because  of  CYP2J2  inhibition  could  theoretically  lead  to 
exaggerated pharmacology and related adverse effects. However, the applicant replied to this concern 
that quantitative contribution of CYP2J2 to ponesimod metabolic clearance in vivo is expected to be low 
and  that,  thus,  inhibition  of  CYP2J2  by  co-administered  compounds  would  not  be  expected  to  have 
clinically relevant impact on ponesimod exposure. 
In study FK13541, ponesimod was not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3; however, it inhibited the 
uptake of 3H-Egluc in both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transfected cells. It was not clear how ponesimod 
inhibited the uptake of 3H-Egluc when at the same time not being a substrate of the two transporters. 
The applicant was consequently expected to discuss this discrepancy. However, the applicant described 
that the observed discrepancy could theoretically also be accounted to allosteric OATP1B inhibition by 
inhibitors or to post-translational modifications or interactions between the inhibitor and the transporter 
at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Relevant literature was provided on these speculations. 
Therefore, the concern was considered resolved. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  applicant  conducted  an  extensive  non-clinical  programme  to  assess  the  toxicology  and 
environmental risk of ponesimod. All pivotal studies were conducted in GLP compliance. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were carried out, as lack of toleration was already observed in dose-range 
finding studies in rats and in dogs. This is acceptable. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant submitted an extensive repeated dose toxicity programme in rats and dogs. However, note 
that  also  a  dose-range  finding  study  (non-GLP)  was  conducted  with  cynomolgus  monkeys  (Study  T-
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 33/136 
 
  
 
 
08.427). Regarding the submitted rat and dog repeated dose toxicity studies (RDTS) programme, the 
applicant conducted the following studies:  
•  Rats: 3 days maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study (Study T-05.018), 14 days dose range finding 
(DRF) study (Study T-05.019), 2x4 weeks studies with 4 weeks recovery (Study T-05.043 and 
T-05.129), 26 weeks study with 13 weeks recovery (Study T-05.134); 
•  Dogs: DRF study (Study T-05.020), 2x4 weeks studies with 4 weeks recovery (Study T-05.042 
and  T-05.148),  26  weeks  study  with  13  weeks  recovery  (Study  T-05.139),  13/26  weeks  with 
daily and bi-daily dosing (Study T-07.186), 52 weeks study with 13 weeks recovery (Study T-
06.186), 52 weeks MTD study (Study T-08.357). 
The extent of this programme is considered sufficient to support an MAA of ponesimod. Repeated dose 
toxicity was also studied in mice (to obtain preliminary data for carcinogenicity studies) and to a certain 
extent in rabbits (to obtain preliminary data for embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies). The following 
RDST were conducted with mice and rabbits: 
•  Mouse:  14  days  DRF  study  (Study  T-05.128),  2x13  weeks  studies  (Study  T-06.049  and  T-
07.015); 
•  Rabbit: 14 days DRF study (Study T-05.111). 
Repeated dose toxicity studies performed in rats, dogs, and mice identified the lung (mouse, rat, dog), 
heart (dog), nervous system (clinical signs, dog), skin (dog), red blood cell (RBC) compartment (rat), 
liver 
(mouse, 
rat,  dog),  adrenals 
(rat),  kidney/brain 
(rat;  carcinogenicity  study)  and 
lymphocytes/lymphoid  organs  (mouse,  rat,  dog),  as  the  main  organs  affected  by  treatment  with 
ponesimod. The effects of ponesimod on the lung, the heart and the CNS were further characterised in 
dedicated  safety  pharmacology  studies;  therefore,  no  concerns  were  raised  on  the  toxicity  on  these 
organs. Some other organs might also be affected, which is the content of selected other concerns on 
the toxicology of ponesimod. It should be noted that for monkeys only a non-GLP tolerability study is 
available  which  has  limited  group  sizes  and  does  not  include  histopathological  examination,  so  only 
limited conclusions can be drawn from this study and for this species. 
The applicant derived no observed adverse effect level (NO(A)EL)s for systemic toxicity at 2 mg/kg/day 
in rats and at 0.4 mg/kg/day in dogs after 4 weeks of treatment. After chronic treatment for 26 weeks, 
NOAELs for systemic toxicity were established at 30 mg/kg/day in rats and at 2 mg/kg/day in dogs. In 
the 52-week toxicity study in dogs, the applicant derived a NOAEL at 3 mg/kg/day. Significant toxicity 
observed in rats at doses of 400 mg/kg/day and in dogs at doses ≥75 mg/kg/day led to unscheduled 
necropsy of animals and/or dose reduction. 
A  study  on  the  combinatory  repeated  dose  toxicity  of  ponesimod  and  dimethyl  fumarate  in  dogs  was 
submitted (Study T-14.019). As this combination is not within the applied indication of this MAA, only 
the results obtained from the ponesimod-alone groups of this study were assessed. 
A  number  of  other  concerns  were  originally  raised  during  the  procedure  with  regards  to  the  RDTS 
programme.  
In many animal toxicity studies, clearly decreased plasma transaminase levels (statistically significant) 
were  observed.  The  relevance  of  this  finding  was  originally  not  discussed.  However,  the  applicant 
demonstrated (by referring to adequate literature) that the scattered decreases in plasma transaminase 
levels in the conducted toxicology do not bear relevance. 
In  many  animal  studies,  increased  platelet  counts  relative  to  control  group  values  were  observed  in 
animals of test-article groups. These findings were originally not sufficiently discussed. The applicant, 
however, provided a sufficiently detailed discussion on this finding and concluded that, based on the lack 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 34/136 
 
  
 
 
of e.g. increases in prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), adverse bone 
marrow changes and clinically increases in platelets, this finding also bears no relevance. This position 
was supported. 
Direct  (organ  weights  and  macroscopic/histological  alterations)  and  indirect  (clinical  chemistry)  liver 
effects in animal toxicity studies could be attributed to the administration of ponesimod. The applicant 
speculates that liver effects in test-article groups were non-adverse and reflect metabolic adaptations to 
ponesimod administration. However, in some animal toxicity studies, direct or indirect liver effects were 
not fully reversible after the recovery period, indicating that ponesimod could have induced permanent 
hepatotoxic  effects. Upon request, the applicant  provided an adequate  discussion on the relevance of 
the observed liver alterations in animal studies and attributed them to non-adverse change in the liver 
due to  drug-induced  enzyme induction. In rats and dogs, the applicant argued that no corresponding 
increases in plasma transaminase levels were observed, further supporting the non-adversity of these 
findings. At very high doses in mice, the observed focal hepatocellular necrosis and slight increases in 
alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  can  –  according  to  the  applicant  –  also  be  accounted  to  excessive 
hypertrophy  from  enzyme  induction.  The  totality  of  data,  therefore,  indicates  that  the  observed  liver 
alterations bear little relevance. 
In  some  animal  studies,  prostate  weights  in  test-article  groups  were  altered  relative  to  control  group 
weights (statistically significant). Originally, the applicant did not elaborate on these findings, but only 
concluded  that  these  alterations  were  not  test-article  related.  During  the  procedure,  the  applicant 
provided a useful discussion and concluded that the relevance of the lower prostate weight in the 26-
week dog study is considered low as this alteration was only noted at high exposure, not reproduced in 
the  52-week  dog-study  at  similar  exposures,  and  as  no  related  microscopic  findings  in  the  male 
reproductive  tract  across  the  non-clinical  studies  observed.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  argues  that  in 
beagle dogs, there can be a high inter-individual variability in prostate weight (this could indicate that 
the observed alterations in prostate weights might indeed be chance findings). Considering these points, 
the prostate alterations occasionally observed in dog studies unlikely bear relevance for patients. 
In  study  T-08.427,  as  the  dose  increased  100-fold  in  female  cynomolgus  monkeys  from  10  to  1000 
mg/kg/day during the ascending dose phase, the Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve in a 
dosing interval of 24 hours (AUC0-24) increased 5.2 and 6.4 fold, respectively. This is a considerably low 
increase in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax given the 100-fold increase in dose. 
Originally, the applicant was asked to elaborate on this issue. However, the applicant refused to answer 
this question accordingly, as this cynomolgus monkey study was only an exploratory non-GLP compliant 
study. As this study was only a non-pivotal study, this issue was no longer pursued. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity was studied in a standard battery of in vitro assays and in vivo tests, including Ames assays 
of ponesimod (Study T-05.058) and its two most important metabolites M13 (Study 09.519) and M12 
(Study  T-09.520),  an  in  vitro  chromosome  aberration  assay  using  cultured  human  peripheral  blood 
lymphocytes (Study T-05.064), and an in vivo micronuclei assay in rats (Study T-07.143). The submitted 
genotoxicity  programme  adheres  to  the  guidance  given  in  the  respective  ICH  S2(R1)  document,  no 
additional studies are required.   
In  study  T-05.064,  small  increases  in  the  frequency  of  cells  with  numerical  aberrations  in  test-article 
groups (above the historical control range) were observed. However, not a single numerical aberration 
was observed in the control groups of experiment 1 & 2, whereas sporadic numerical aberrations were 
observed in most treatment groups, albeit they never followed a dose-response trend. As the treatment 
of  MS  requires  a  chronic  administration  of  ponesimod,  the  applicant  was  expected  to  provide  a  more 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 35/136 
 
  
 
 
detailed discussion on the observed sporadic increases of numerical aberrations in human lymphocytes 
observed in this study relative to control groups (in which no numerical aberrations were found at all). 
The  applicant  clarified  that  these  sporadic  increases  seen  under  some  test  conditions  were  not 
reproducible  (confined  to  single  culture),  not  statistically  significant  and  that  there  was  no  dose-
relationship. The few numerical aberrations can therefore be considered a random chance finding. 
The Ames test did not show a mutagenic potential for ponesimod as well as M12 and M13. The in vitro 
chromosome aberration test demonstrated a slight (and potentially negligible) tendency of ponesimod 
to induce aneugenicity, whereas clastogenicity was not observed. The in vivo rat micronucleus did not 
demonstrate test-article related effects on micronuclei formation.  
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity of ponesimod was assessed in a long-term two-year mouse (Study T-13.023) and rat 
(Study T-13.024) study. This submitted carcinogenicity programme is in line with the recommendations 
given in the ICH M3(R2) guidelines and is therefore acceptable. 
In  mice,  the  incidence  of  neoplastic  vascular  tumours  (haemangiosarcomas,  and  the  combination  of 
haemangiosarcomas and haemangiomas) was statistically significantly increased in test-article groups 
when compared to concurrent controls. The incidence of spontaneous haemangiosarcomas ranged from 
2-12% in the historical control data of the respective contract research organisation. In study T-13.023, 
the combined incidence of haemangiosarcomas and haemangiomas was 12-25% in ponesimod-treated 
mice, in contrast to 2-10% in the control groups. Therefore, this increased incidence was without doubt 
related to the administration of ponesimod. However, the applicant argued and provided literature that 
the spontaneous incidence of haemangiosarcomas in humans was reported to be 0.00021%, but high in 
mice  (e.g.  2-10%  in  the  control  groups  of  this  study),  indicating  that  humans  are  substantially  less 
susceptible to developing these tumours than mice are. The applicant further speculates (by referring to 
adequate literature) that the high background incidence of haemangiosarcomas and haemangiomas in 
mice  is  considered  to  be  related  to  a  species-specific  higher  rate  of  endothelial  cell  proliferation  as 
compared to rats or humans. In this setting, the applicant speculates that ponesimod acts as a mitogen 
and  increases  vascular  proliferation  rates,  which  leads  to  tumour  formation  and  in  the  end 
carcinogenesis.  The  applicant  states  that  similar  findings  have  been  described  in  the  mouse 
carcinogenicity study with the S1P modulators fingolimod and siponimod, indicating that this could be a 
class effect of S1P modulators in mice. In rats (Study T-13.024), ponesimod did not induce test article-
related neoplastic lesions. In general, the applicant’s positions were considered plausible; however, also 
in dog repeated dose toxicity studies, vascular arterial lesions were observed that could theoretically be 
promotive for tumorigenesis. These arterial lesions were characterised by hypertrophy and hyperplasia 
of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media and, more pronounced at 40 mg/kg/day, by the development 
of multiple vascular channels within the hypertrophic media and the luminal side of the internal elastic 
lamina.  This  could  indicate  that  ponesimod  acts  as  a  mitogen  in  dog  vasculature.  Considering  these 
aspects, the  applicant was invited to  elaborate on these aspects. During the procedure, the applicant 
responded to these questions that in the mouse, endothelial cells are the primary affected cell type and 
considered the result of an S1P1 mediated increase in endothelial cell proliferation, whereby in the dog 
the arterial smooth muscle cells are mainly affected, secondary to S1P3-mediated vasoconstriction and 
subsequent  haemodynamic  changes,  resulting  in  exaggerated  arterial  adaptation/remodelling.  The 
applicant  further  specified  that  the  vascular  lesions  in  the  dogs  were  secondary  to  hemodynamic 
changes/ischemia and are not preneoplastic, and no risk factor for neoplasia. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of the observed haemangiosarcomas and haemangiomas, the applicant specified that these 
neoplasms are a species-specific effect in mice possibly related to increases in vascular endothelial cell

activation  and  proliferation  associated  with  the  release  of  the  pro-angiogenic  factor,  placental  growth 
factor (PLGF2), and not relevant to human. This interpretation is endorsed. 
In study T-13.024, the applicant speculates that the observed brain mineralisations in this study were 
caused by a disturbed Ca homeostasis in test article groups. However, no relevant Ca alterations were 
observed in plasma in clinical biochemistry investigations. As this effect was highly dose-dependent (and 
was maximally observed in 1 out of the 51 animals in both control groups of both sexes), it originally 
was not considered likely that brain mineralisation was an age-related background finding. However, the 
applicant  responded  to  this  concern  that  brain  mineralisation  was  reported  only  in  rats  and  was  not 
observed  in  other  preclinical  species  (dogs  and  mice)  and  provided  literature  that  demonstrates  that 
other S1P modulators also increased the incidences and severity of brain mineralisation in aged rats but 
not in other preclinical species. Considering these points, the observed mineralisations in geriatric rats 
are most likely a species-specific finding with no relevance for the clinical use of ponesimod. 
The uterus weight of female rats was clearly increased in test-article groups of the T-13.024 Study. This 
observation  even  achieved  an  increase  of  almost  a  factor  three  relative  to  control  values,  suggesting 
that increased uterus weights were not a result of normal menstrual cyclicity. In addition, the incidence 
of  uterus  distension  was  increased  in  high  dose  groups,  following  a  dose-response  relationship. 
Furthermore, the incidence of macroscopically observed thick uteri was increased in test-article groups. 
Also,  ovary  cysts  were  observed  in  females  of  intermediate  and  high  treatment  groups  in  a  dose-
dependent fashion, but not in the two-vehicle groups. To a lesser extent, macroscopic alterations of the 
ovaries were also exclusively attributable to test-article groups, and not to the two control groups. The 
applicant argued and provided literature that demonstrated that geriatric animals are not a good indicator 
for non-neoplastic effects on the female reproductive tract. Considering this, the applicant cautioned to 
interpret non-neoplastic findings in old rodents in carcinogenicity studies (such as this study). Finally, 
the applicant argued that there was no clear dose-relationship and no correlation with test-article related 
microscopic findings of the female reproductive tract. Considering these points, it indeed appears that 
the observed findings could be a chance finding. 
In study T-07.015, even up to 800 mg/kg/day, there was no consistent decrease in lymphocyte counts 
in  mice  after  13  weeks  of  administration.  Therefore,  it  appears  that  ponesimod  was  not  sufficiently 
pharmacologically  active  in  mice.  However,  decreased  lymphocyte  counts  were  found  in  mice  at  sub-
acute exposure (Study T-05.128). Given the discrepancy between sub-acute and chronic dosing, and the 
fact that chronic administration of considerably high ponesimod doses did not show consistent effects on 
the lymphocyte counts, the applicant was expected to discuss if the mouse is susceptible to the PD of 
ponesimod at chronic exposures, and whether the mouse is a relevant non-clinical species for long-term 
studies (especially in regards to the conducted carcinogenicity study). The applicant responded to this 
concern that the absent decrease in lymphocyte counts in mice after 13 weeks of in Study T-07.015 24 
hours post-dose could be related to the high clearance of ponesimod in the mouse and the consequent 
rapid  fading  of  the  pharmacological  effect  (in  terms  of  decreasing  peripheral  lymphocytes).  This 
justification was found to be plausible. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  applicant  conducted  an  extensive  non-clinical  programme  to  assess  the  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity of ponesimod. The following studies were conducted: 
•  Segment I: Fertility and early embryonic development studies in female (Study T-07.109) and 
male (Study T-08.429) rats; 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 37/136 
 
  
 
 
•  Segment II: DRF (Study T-05.110) and pivotal (Study T-06.093) EFD studies in rats, DRF (Study 
T-06.074) and pivotal (Study T-06.075) EFD studies in rabbits; 
•  Segment  III:  DRF  (Study  TOX13421)  and  pivotal  (Study  TOX13502)  pre-  postnatal 
developmental toxicity (PPND) study in rats; 
• 
Juvenile toxicity: DRF (Study T-15.063) and pivotal (Study T-16.018) juvenile toxicity study in 
rats.  
This  programme  suffices  the  guidance  given  in  the  ICH  M3(R2)  and  the  ICH  S5(R3)  documents. 
Therefore, the applicant’s programme on reproductive and developmental toxicity is considered adequate 
to  support  a  potential  MA.  Note  that  because  of  the  EFD  study  results,  the  applicant  defined  a 
contraindication for pregnancy in the Summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
In the female fertility study in rats, fertility appeared to be largely unaffected by treatment at doses up 
to  100  mg/kg/day.  There  was  no  effect  on  early  pregnancy  parameters.  In  the  male  fertility  study, 
mating and fertility were unaffected by treatment at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. The applicant claims 
that  no  effects  were  observed  on  male  reproductive  organs  in  the  male  fertility  study.  However, 
statistically significant decreases (below the historical control range) in sperm counts were observed in 
testes (all three ponesimod groups) and epididymides (low and intermediate ponesimod group) of rats 
in study T-08.429. The applicant claims that these findings were incidental due to the absence of a dose-
dependency  and  morphological  and  microscopic  observations.  The  fact  that  no  dose-response  was 
observed among the affected treatment groups does not necessarily imply that these findings are not 
treatment related: (i) first, systemic exposure to ponesimod was frequently less than dose-proportional, 
indicating that a dose-relationship, in that case, would not be as extensive as derived from the applied 
dosing  regimens  and  (ii)  second,  the  potential  adverse  mode  of  action  of  ponesimod,  leading  to  a 
decreased sperm count in testes and epididymides could have already been saturated at the lowest dose 
administered (10 mg/kg/day). In this case, an increase in dose would not lead to an increased severity 
of  the  observed  effect.  Furthermore,  the  applicant’s  claim  of  absent  macroscopic  and  microscopic 
correlates  to  decreased  sperm  counts  in  this  study  was  originally  not  fully  supported,  as  increased 
testes/BW  ratios  were  observed  in  all  three  treatment  groups  of  this  study  (attaining  statistical 
significance only at the 10 mg/kg/day dosing regimen). Additionally, in the rat 14 days repeated dose 
toxicity study T-05.019, cellular debris in the epididymides were observed at the highest dosing regimen, 
indicating  that  ponesimod  is  also  capable  of  inducing  microscopical  alterations  in  the  gonads  of  male 
rats. Considering these points, the applicant was invited to thoroughly discuss the observed decreased 
sperm  counts  in  this  study  and  propose  a  potential  aetiological  relation  of  this  observation  with 
ponesimod  exposure.  Finally,  the  applicant  was  expected  to  discuss  whether  decreased  sperm  counts 
are a known class effect of other S1P modulators, or whether the impacts of S1P modulators on male 
fertility have been assessed in other non-clinical species or male patients. The applicant responded to 
these  concerns  that  the  observed  changes  were  minor  (<15%)  and  without  biological  relevance.  The 
applicant further specified that a decrease of >20- 25 % in sperm counts in rats is needed before being 
considered  biologically  relevant.  Due  to  this  estimation  and  because  of  the  absence  of  a  pathological 
correlate and dose- relationship, the concern was considered as being resolved. 
The EFD studies in rats showed marked embryofoetal toxicity in which embryofoetal survival, growth, 
and morphological development were severely compromised at 40 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic effects with 
malformations of the limbs and the cardiovascular system (including ventricular septum defects) were 
observed at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. A NOAEL for embryofoetal toxicity/teratogenicity in rats was claimed 
by the applicant at 1 mg/kg/day. The rabbit even appeared more sensitive towards ponesimod-related 
EFD-disruption than the rat. EFD studies in rabbits showed an increase in post-implantation loss after 
dosing  at  4  mg/kg/day.  Foetal  findings  consisted  of  an  increased  incidence  of  foetuses  with  fused 
sternebrae and additional minor blood vessels arising from the aortic arch. The applicant claims that the 
Assessment report

embryofoetal NOAEL in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day. In the PPND studies, dosing of mated (F0) female rats 
at 20 mg/kg/day led to a slightly lower viability index of pups from birth to postnatal day (PND)4. The 
F1 pups had slightly lower BW and BW gains at 20 mg/kg/day, and F1 females showed a lower fertility 
rate at 20 mg/kg/day. Sexual maturation was delayed in F1 males and females of all groups.  
Interestingly,  no  effects  on  sexual  development,  fertility  and  pregnancy  were  observed  in  the  pivotal 
juvenile  toxicity  study  (Study  T-16.018),  contrasting  the  delayed  sexual  development  and  lowered 
female fertility observed in the F1 generation in the pivotal PPND study (Study TOX13502). This could 
suggest  that  ponesimod  exposure  during  early  development  (PPND)  may  irreversibly  alter  the 
development of the reproductive system, whereas post-weaning exposure during juvenile development 
does not. The applicant was expected to elaborate on these irreversible alterations in the offspring that 
were exposed. In response to this question, the applicant suggested that it was maternal toxicity that 
caused the developmental toxicity, and that consequently such effects were not observed in the juvenile 
toxicity  study  in  which  the  offspring  was  directly  dosed.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  stressed  that  the 
observed effect on F1 fertility in the PPND study is appropriately mentioned in the SmPC.  
F1 pups were noted to have ponesimod in the plasma on lactation Days 4 and 12 which would indicate 
ponesimod exposure to pups via the milk of the lactating dam. At 20 mg/kg/day of maternal dose, the 
F1 pup exposure levels were approximately 0.2-fold of the expected clinical exposure at 20 mg daily. 
These findings were included in the SmPC. Recommendation that women receiving ponesimod should 
not  breastfeed  is  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4.6.  In  the  section  5.3.  information  is  provided  that 
ponesimod was present in the plasma of rats F1 pups, indicating exposure from the milk of the lactating 
dam.  
In the pivotal juvenile toxicity study, the applicant claims that the NOAEL was at 100 mg/kg/day. Based 
on reduced humoral immunocompetence observed at all ponesimod dosing regimens (see below) and 
liver and lung findings, the applicant was invited to reconsidered the claimed NOAEL at 100 mg/kg/day. 
As  part  of  responses,  the  applicant  defended  the  NOAEL  of  this  study,  which  was  defined  at  100 
mg/kg/day. Findings were limited to adaptive and/or pharmacological responses in white blood counts 
(WBC) and reticulocyte counts, lipid parameters, lymphoid organs, lung and liver and were found to be 
fully reversible. No delay in sexual maturation and no decreased fertility were observed. 
In study T-16.018, the humoral response to antigens in adult rats (to SRBCs) in the pivotal 26 weeks 
repeated dose toxicity study (Study T-05.134) did not indicate an impaired humoral immunocompetence 
under  ponesimod  exposure.  Contrarily,  in  juvenile  rats,  humoral  immunocompetence  towards  the 
antigen  KLH  was  partly  impaired  at  all  dosing  regimens.  Interestingly,  humoral  immunocompetence 
towards KLH was not clearly decreased in adult dogs in study T-14.019. Hence, partial impairment of 
humoral immunocompetence by ponesimod administration seems to be age-dependent and refined to 
non-adult  animals.  In  response  to  this,  the  applicant  discussed  that  while  humans  and  nonhuman 
primates are born with a functional immune system, much of the rodent immune system development 
occurs postpartum (the applicant specified that rats still have a developing immune system up to PND70 
and  that  T-dependent  antibody  response  (TDARs)  should  therefore  be  assessed  after  PND45). 
Considering  this,  the  applicant  speculated  that  ponesimod  exposure  during  this  phase  of  immune 
development in the rat is either delaying lymphoid development or the rats may not be fully mature to 
be  able  to  compensate  with  other  antigen  presenting  cells.  Considering  these  points,  the  decreased 
immunocompetence after ponesimod exposure in rats is unlikely to be relevant in patients. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was studied after intravenously administration of ponesimod in rabbits (Study T-
13.001). No test-article related signs of local irritation were observed.

Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity studies were conducted, which is acceptable.  
Similarly, no dedicated immunotoxicity studies were conducted; however,  immunotoxicity evaluations 
(immunophenotyping and humoral immunocompetence evaluations towards sheep erythrocytes [SRBC] 
and  keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin [KHL]  antigen  challenge)  were  included  in  general  toxicity  studies. 
Ponesimod  was  immunotoxic  as  it  caused  decreased  peripheral  WBC  counts,  especially  affecting 
lymphocytes.  This,  however,  constitutes  the  pharmacologic  mode  of  action  of  ponesimod.  Of  note, 
especially the peripheral counts of CD4+ T cells (and to a lesser extent CD8+ T cells) were decreased in 
immunophenotyping  studies,  whereas  NK  cells  and  monocytes  were  generally  resistant  towards  a 
reduction in peripheral blood. Humoral immunocompetence towards antigen challenge was generally not 
affected  by  ponesimod  administration  in  adult  rats  and  dogs  but  was  compromised  by  ponesimod 
exposure in juvenile rats (as discussed above).  
The potential of ponesimod to induce drug dependency was discussed by the applicant to be negligible. 
This appears plausible.  
No dedicated toxicology studies were conducted with metabolites (with the exception of Ames tests), as 
the  relevant  metabolite  concentrations  in  animal  studies  were  above  the  concentrations  expected  in 
patients.  As  the  most  abundant  metabolites  of  ponesimod  (M12  and  M13)  are  additionally  hardly 
pharmacologically active, and are not genotoxic, the waiving of dedicated toxicity studies on metabolites 
is acceptable.  
Studies on impurities are discussed in the Quality section.  
Additionally, a phototoxicity study was submitted (Study T-05.060), which demonstrated that ponesimod 
could be considered as non-phototoxic. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was submitted, in which the applicant determined the Kow of ponesimod (4.3) and calculated its 
predicted  environmental  concentrations  surfacewater  (PECsw)  (0.00965  μg/L).  Based  on  these  two 
values, the applicant originally concluded that ponesimod does not need a persistence, bioaccumulation 
and toxicity (PBT) assessment, and that no phase II evaluation of ponesimod is required.  
The  applicant’s  determination  of  the  Kow  of  ponesimod  was  originally  considered  to  be  potentially 
erroneous. The solubility of ponesimod in water was reported to be 0.669 µg/mL at pH 5.76, in 1 litre 
water this would be 0.669 mg/L. In experiments for Kow determination, ponesimod concentrations were 
however,  observed  up  to  1.72  mg/L  in  water,  suggesting  that  ponesimod  was  oversaturated,  as  the 
claimed solubility limit in water was surpassed by more than a factor 2. The different pH in the watery 
compartment in the reaction containers (which ranged between 6.24 and 6.67) relative to the solubility 
limit determined at pH 5.76 thereby most likely did not cause an increased solubility, as the applicant 
stated that no ionisation of ponesimod is predicted in the environmentally relevant pH range. Because 
oversaturation  in  the  determination  of  Kow  coefficients  must  be  avoided  (as  an  oversaturated 
compartment would yield different Kow coefficients at different concentrations), the applicant was invited 
to clarify:(i) whether the derivation of the solubility of ponesimod in water (0.669 µg/mL) as provided 
could have been erroneous and (ii) 
whether  the  water  compartment  in  the  Kow  experiment  could 
have indeed been oversaturated with ponesimod, and if this could have influenced the determination of 
the Kow coefficient.  
The applicant indeed responded to this concern that the evaluation of the water solubility and partition 
coefficient  of  ponesimod  was  not  conducted  according  to  relevant  quality  standards.  Therefore,  the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 40/136 
 
  
 
 
applicant  proposed  that  these  studies  will  be  newly  conducted  as  post-authorisation  measure  (PAM) 
[REC]  in  2022,  whereby  the  applicant  specifies  that  the  studies  will  be  conducted  along  with  the 
respective  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  and  GLP-requirements. 
This strategy is endorsed. 
Then, the applicant’s calculation of Fpen (Factor of market penetration) and consequently, PECsw was 
not supported. At first, using an outdated MS prevalence (90.7 in 100000) from a publication from the 
year  2003  for  the  calculation  of  Fpen  was  not  considered  acceptable.  Then,  taking  the  mean  MS 
prevalence found in Europe for deriving the Fpen was also not considered acceptable, as MS prevalences 
considerably  vary  among  European  countries.  Therefore,  a  more  conservative  approach  was 
recommended for the derivation of the Fpen value. This can be achieved by calculating the Fpen value 
by using an up-to-date epidemiologic prevalence of MS of the European country exhibiting the highest 
MS burden (in the case of Europe this would be Denmark with 227 MS cases per 100000; Atlas of MS, 
2013). Using this prevalence for the derivation of the Fpen, the PECsw of ponesimod would be 0.0227 
μg/L, being clearly above the value triggering a phase II evaluation (0.01 μg/L). (Note that the indication 
of this MAA only includes relapsing forms of MS; therefore, derived Fpen values using a prevalence for 
all MS forms would, in reality, be a bit lower. However, as most forms of MS are relapsing in their nature, 
this  effect  is  probably  only  minimal.)  Considering  all  these  points,  the  applicant  was  expected  to 
commence  a  phase  II  evaluation.  Additionally,  as  the  Kow  of  ponesimod  is  above  the  trigger  value  of 
1000 L/kg, a fish bioaccumulation study, according to OECD TG 305 in Tier B was considered warranted.  
The applicant agreed with the raised concerns and discussed that a phase II ERA assessment is necessary 
for determining the potential impact of ponesimod on the environment. Therefore, the applicant proposed 
that the following ERA studies (Table 2) will be conducted along respective OECD and GLP-requirements 
as PAM [REC] in Q4 2022. 
Table 2: ERA studies to be conducted by the applicant as a post-authorisation measure 
This approach could be acceptable. However, the applicant is reminded that the decision whether the 
scope of the proposed Tier B phase II studies is sufficient depends on the results of the Tier A phase II 
studies. Completeness of the ERA programme will be assessed once the studies will be submitted in the 
frame of a variation.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  PD  profile  of  ACT-128800  was  thoroughly  evaluated  by  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  ACT-128800 
could  be  demonstrated  to  be  an  S1P1  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  S1P3  agonist.  In  vivo,  ACT-128800 
efficiently reduced circulating lymphocytes in healthy animals, with naïve CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well 
as γδ T-cells and NKT, being the most affected subsets. In contrast to non-selective S1P agonists, upon 
ACT-128800 treatment lymphocyte levels returned to baseline more rapidly after cessation of treatment. 
ACT-128800 also proved effective in preventing the onset of or reducing clinical signs in T-cell mediated 
disease models. 
From non-clinical safety pharmacology studies, no signs for ACT-128800 to have effects on QT interval 
prolongation and HR could be seen. A dose-dependent increase in BP was observed in dogs and could 
be  related  to  a  vasoconstrictive  activity  of  ACT-128800  specifically  mediated  on  canine  arteries.  No 
constrictive activity was detected ex vivo on human or rat arteries. With regard to respiratory function, 
a dose-dependent transient slight impairment was observed in rats but not in dogs. Occasional cases of 
dyspnoea in response to ACT-128800 treatment were also noted in clinical trials. In vitro studies revealed 
that  ACT-128800  has  a  contractile  effect  on  rat  tracheae  and  human  bronchi  at  supra-therapeutic 
concentrations. ACT-128800 was also found to increase vascular permeability in rat lungs which lead to 
transient perivascular oedema, alveolar histiocytosis and increase in lung weight. No notable effects of 
ACT-128800 on the CNS were detected. Thus, all effects detected in the scope of safety pharmacology 
studies are considered to have been thoroughly followed up and could be well put into the context with 
the pharmacologic action of ACT-128800. 
The  PK  of  ponesimod  were  thoroughly  investigated  in  a  wide  panel  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies. 
However,  a  number  of  other  concerns  were  originally  raised  on  non-clinical  PK  aspects  that  were  not 
sufficiently discussed by the applicant, or that may exhibit safety concerns. These aspects were properly 
addressed by the applicant. In general, the PK of ponesimod have been sufficiently assessed. It exhibited 
a  moderately  well  absorption,  a  thorough  distribution  into  tissues,  a  complex  metabolism,  and  a 
prevailing hepatobiliary excretion. These ADME characteristics fit the high lipophilicity of ponesimod. DDI 
studies demonstrated that interactions of ponesimod with concomitantly administered pharmaceuticals 
or other substances are unlikely at the encountered therapeutic ponesimod levels.  
Toxicological  investigations  of  ponesimod  demonstrated  that  the  non-clinical  safety  of  this  compound 
was  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  other  S1P  modulators.  The  conducted  toxicology  programme  is 
considered to be adequate in terms of quantity and quality of studies. Affected off-target organs in non-
clinical  studies  were  especially  the  lung  and  the  heart  (at  high  doses  also  the  CNS);  however,  the 
applicant  sufficiently  addressed  adverse  effects  related  to  disturbances  of  these  off-targets  in  an 
exhaustive  safety  pharmacology  programme.  Other  off-targets  affected  by  ponesimod  administration 
were  consistently  identified  in  non-clinical  studies  and  were  the  subject  of  dedicated  other  concerns. 
Similarly to other S1P modulators, ponesimod largely proved to be non-genotoxic and non-carcinogenic, 
observed carcinogenic effects in the mouse most likely constituted a species-specific finding that is not 
relevant for human patients. As identified for other S1P modulators, ponesimod was toxic to EFD; the 
applicant, therefore, defined a contraindication on pregnancy. Furthermore, the applicant claimed that 
ponesimod  was  not  toxic  to  male  and  female  fertility.  Finally,  developmental  toxicity  appears  to  be 
refined  to  disturbances  during  early  ontogenesis  at  the  PPND  stage  (via  maternal  exposure).  Other 
modes  of  toxicity  (phototoxicity,  local  tolerance,  etc.)  were  investigated,  but  no  relevant  test-article 
related effects were found. 
Originally,  a  phase  I  ERA  was  conducted,  in  which  the  Kow  of  ponesimod  was  determined  to  be  4.3, 
whereas its PECsw was calculated to be 0.00965 μg/L. Based on these two values, the applicant originally 
concluded  that  neither  a  phase  II  evaluation  nor  a  PBT  evaluation  are  required.  However,  the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 42/136 
 
  
 
 
determination of the Kow was considered potentially erroneous, and the calculation of the original PECsw 
was not supported. Considering this, the applicant was originally expected to clarify the experimental 
determination of the Kow of ponesimod and conduct a phase II ERA assessment of ponesimod (as the 
PECsw trigger value is surpassed when correctly calculated). Additionally, a Tier B fish accumulation study 
was originally demanded because of the high lipophilicity of ponesimod. The applicant agreed upon these 
recommendations and committed himself to conduct the required ERA studies and submit them as post-
authorisation measure in Q4 2022. This approach is endorsed.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive study package covering PD, PK and toxicology has been submitted in support of the 
MAA of ACT-128800 (ponesimod). No major objections have been raised for the non-clinical part of the 
dossier. A number of other concerns were satisfactorily addressed, the submitted non-clinical programme 
therefore  supports  MA.  However,  note  that  the  applicant  committed  himself  to  submit  missing  ERA 
studies as PAM [REC] in Q4 2022. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues:

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  PK,  PD,  efficacy  and  safety  of  ponesimod  were  evaluated  in  16  Phase  1,  1  Phase  2a  (A2000),  1 
Phase 2b (B201), and 1 Phase 3 (B301) clinical studies (Table 3). The 16 Phase 1 studies were performed 
in healthy subjects, or subjects otherwise healthy but with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Overall, single oral doses of ponesimod ranged from 1 to 75 mg, and multiple oral doses ranged from 5 
to 100 mg/day in healthy subjects for up to 22 days. Repeated doses of 10 to 40 mg were administered 
in subjects with MS. 
In addition, a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model was developed for ponesimod based on plasma 
concentration  data  of  ponesimod  obtained  from  13  clinical  studies.  This  popPK  model  was  used  to 
estimate metrics of systemic exposure for establishing exposure-response (ER) (PKPD) relationships. 
Further, the applicant carried out a broad panel of in vitro studies to identify the enzymes involved in 
the  ponesimod  metabolism  and  to  investigate  potential  enzyme  induction  and  inhibition  as  well  as 
transporter inhibition by ponesimod (Table 4).  
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  (Good  Clinical  Practice)  as  claimed  by  the 
applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methodology 
LC-MS/MS methods were developed and validated for quantitation of ponesimod (parent compound) and 
metabolites in human plasma and human urine. In addition, two qualified methods were used for the 
determination of radiolabelled ponesimod and metabolites in human plasma, whole blood, human faeces 
and  human  urine.  Further,  the  potential  in  vivo  chiral  inversion  of  ponesimod  into  ACT-128818  (S-
enantiomer of ponesimod) was evaluated, and the potential for isomerisation has been investigated. A 
minor  amount  of  S-enantiomer  ACT-128818  is  formed,  between  0.96  and  1.62%  of  the  amount  of 
ponesimod. Therefore, achiral methods can be used to determine ponesimod. Exposure to ambient light 
might cause Z-E isomerisation, and therefore, in most studies, samples were protected from light. 
It should be noted that the methods evolved in accordance with the requests from the former Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry (2001) and its subsequent updates, and later the EMA 
Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1  Corr.  2**)  was 
followed.  In  general,  the  inter-  and  intra-assay  precision  and  accuracy  for  all  assays  of  ponesimod  in 
human plasma were within the acceptance criteria for the chosen quality control (QC) samples. Incurred 
sample reanalysis analyses have been applied for the major part of the studies, and the results were 
within the acceptance criteria recommended by EMA guideline. 
Descriptive  statistics  have  been  presented  for  all  PK  studies.  Pair-wise  comparisons  between  2 
treatments for Cmax and AUC values were based on log-transformed and dose-normalised data. Ratios 
and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) represent the ratio of point estimates of the geometric means and 
associated CIs. 
Two popPK models have been developed and described by the applicant. The initial model only included 
data from phase I and II studies, the updated model also included data of the phase III study.

The  PK  of  ponesimod  was  characterised  using  an  open,  2-compartment  disposition  model  with  zero-
order plus first-order absorption and linear elimination. The parameters were, in general, estimated with 
adequate  precision.  The  popPK  model  was  used  to  describe  the  PopPK  characteristics  of  ponesimod 
including  between-subject  variability  and  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  covariates  (different 
formulations, demographic variables, the presence of food and the influence of disease). Goodness of fit 
plots  were  presented  to  visualise  the  influence  and  relevance  of  identified  covariates.  Plasma 
concentration data of ponesimod was obtained from 13 clinical studies. Rich plasma sampling was used 
in Phase I studies:AC-058-101, AC-058-102, AC-058-103, AC-058-105, AC-058-107, AC-058-108, AC-
058-109,  AC-058-110,  AC-058-112,  AC-058-113,  AC-058-115.  Sparse  plasma  sampling  was  used  in 
studies  AC-058A200  (study  with  psoriasis),  and  AC-058B201.  The  gathered  data  was  pooled  for  the 
popPK analysis using non-linear mixed effect modelling approach. 
An  external  model  evaluation  was  performed  using  plasma  concentrations  from  study  AC-058b-301 
(phase 3 trial) to verify the predictive performance of the proposed PopPK model. A maximum a posteriori 
assessment was used to estimate the PK model parameters and describe the available ponesimod plasma 
concentrations. When data from phase 3 study was applied, goodness of fit plots indicated a significant 
bias in the lower levels of dose. According to the applicant, that may be explained by the sparse sampling 
used in the B301 study and/or interstudy differences.  
As a result, the B301 data were pooled together with the data from the previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies in order to obtain a global description of ponesimod PK that could improve the description of the 
sparse data from the B301 study. This data was pooled with the previously obtained Phase I and Phase 
II data. After the data was pooled, fixed and random effect were re-estimated. A summary of the key 
post hoc PK parameters is provided for all subjects included the PK dataset. 
For the 2 mg dose data, the model still indicated some underprediction, despite a factor accounting for 
this dose level for the B301 data was included in the final model. The reason for this bias is unclear, and 
it was also in the reference PopPK model for the dose levels lower than 10 mg.  
Absorption  
After a single oral dose (10 mg) administration of ponesimod to healthy male subjects, the absolute oral 
bioavailability of ponesimod was 84%, and tmax was 4 h (study AC-058-114). There was no indication for 
a clinically relevant deviation from a dose-proportional PK. For the most important metabolites, M12 and 
M13, tmax was 4 h and 24 h respectively. 
In  the  clinical  phase  3  study  AC-058B301  with  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  (20  mg  tablets),  food 
status  did  not  affect  the  Cmax  at  steady  state.  Also,  in  the  popPK  study,  only  a  limited  increase  in 
bioavailability (7%) of fed compared to fasted status was observed. The limited increase is not considered 
to be clinically relevant; therefore, ponesimod can be administered with or without food. 
In  study  AC-058-108,  the  rate  of  absorption  was  slightly  higher  after  administration  of  the  tablet 
compared  to  the  capsule  formulation,  with  a  geometric  mean  ratio  of  Cmax (Tablets/capsules)  of  1.27 
(90% CI 1.15-1.40). However, the exposure was comparable between the formulations, with a geometric 
mean ratio for AUCinf of 1.07 (90% CI 0.95-1.19). As ponesimod is intended for chronic use and has a 
t1/2 of  more  than  24  hours,  the  AUC  is  considered  the  most  relevant  PK  parameter.  Since  no  clinical 
significance of these findings is anticipated, no further inquiries are made for this procedure.

Distribution 
The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vd)  in  healthy  subjects  was  160  L  (study  AC-058-114).  In  the 
popPK analysis, the predicted Vd of the central compartment in healthy subjects was 165 L, whereas in 
subjects  with  MS,  it  was  200  L.  The  predicted  Vd  of  the  peripheral  compartment  was  107  L  in  white 
subjects and 67 L in black subjects. The Vd indicates extensive distribution to the tissues. In vitro mean 
plasma protein binding of ponesimod was 99.6% (investigated concentration range was 100 to 200,000 
ng/mL).  Ponesimod  was  found  to  bind  to  both  human  serum  albumin  (99%  bound)  and  alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein (94-96% bound). The in vitro mean protein binding of M13 was 99.0%. No concentration-
dependent effects were observed in the concentration range 100 to 20,000 ng/mL. In subjects with renal 
impairment,  plasma  protein  binding  was  97.8  –  99.5%.  In  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment,  plasma 
protein binding was 99.1- 99.5%. Blood/plasma ratio was 0.68 for ponesimod and 0.50 for M13. There 
was no evidence for entero-hepatic circulation. 
Since the protein binding has been >99% in some studies, the applicant was invited to justify why no 
displacement studies were performed. The applicant’s justification is that ponesimod concentrations are 
low,  it  is  restrictively  eliminated,  and  no  correlations  were  revealed  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic 
function. The justification is deemed acceptable. 
Ponesimod is a neutral, lipophilic molecule that passively permeates across cell membranes and is not a 
substrate of the active transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. The applicant has not evaluated 
whether  ponesimod  is  a  substrate  for  uptake  transporters  (OAT1,  OAT3,  OCT1,  and  OCT2)  or  efflux 
transporters  (MATE1,  and  MATE2K).  Upon  request,  the  applicant  explained  that  the  potential  for 
ponesimod to be a substrate of predominantly renal transporters (such as OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2K 
and OCT2) was not considered relevant, and therefore was not evaluated. It is agreed that no active 
renal transport of ponesimod is expected as it not excreted renally. As uptake transporters OAT1 and 
OAT3, and efflux transporter MATE2K are primarily expressed in the kidney, it is acceptable that these 
transporters  are  not  evaluated.  However,  uptake  transporter  OCT1  is  primarily  expressed  in  the  liver 
and uptake transporter OCT3 and efflux transporter MATE1 are both expressed in kidney and liver. The 
applicant was asked to evaluate if active transport by these transporters is relevant for ponesimod, or 
to justify the lack of in vitro studies. Upon request, the applicant adequately justified that no clinically 
relevant transporter interactions for ponesimod are expected. No clinically relevant interaction with the 
liver  transporters  is  expected  based  on  limited  amount  of  unchanged  drug  eliminated  via  hepatic 
secretion, the good passive cell permeability of ponesimod and non-clinical study results that indicate 
the lack of involvement of active transport into the hepatocytes. 
Elimination 
After a single oral dose, t1/2 of ponesimod ranged 21.7–33.4 h. For the metabolites M12 and M13, t1/2 
ranged 31.7-47.9 h for M12 and 36.0–45.7 h for M13. In multiple-dose studies, t1/2 of ponesimod ranged 
30.9–33.5 h. In the popPK, the t1/2 of ponesimod was also estimated as 33 h.  
Clearance was 3.8 L/h in healthy subjects after a single intravenous infusion. In the popPK, clearance 
was shown to be dependent on the hepatic impairment status, i.e. it was estimated as 6.64 L/h in healthy 
subjects, and 4.66 L/h, 3.18 L/h and 2.13 L/h in mild, moderate and severe hepatic impaired subjects. 
After a single oral administration of 14C-ponesimod to healthy male subjects, 57-80% was recovered in 
faeces,  10-18%  in  urine  and  0.6-1.9%  in  expired  air.  Ponesimod  accounted  for  16%  of  the  dose  in 
faeces, which may well represent the non-absorbed part, since absolute oral bioavailability was found to 
be  84%.  Unchanged  ponesimod  was  not  found  in  urine.  In  faeces,  besides  unchanged  ponesimod, 
metabolite  M12  was  the  major  component  (22%  of  the  radioactivity  in  faeces).  Other  metabolites 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 48/136 
 
  
 
 
represented <1-5% of the radioactivity in faeces. In urine, only small metabolites were found (<1–7% 
of the radioactivity in urine). 
The  mean  cumulative  recovery  of  radioactivity  in  urine  and  faeces  was  77.9%,  which  is  below  the 
preferable  level  of  90%  as  indicated  in  the  guideline  CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1.  Upon  request,  the 
applicant clarified that the level of radioactivity recovered (77.9%) is associated with a long terminal t1/2 
of radioactivity in plasma and slow elimination of radioactivity. 
In  plasma,  unchanged  ponesimod  was  the  major  component,  representing  approximately  66-77%  of 
drug-related  exposure.  The  most  important  metabolites  in  plasma  were  M12  and  M13,  representing 
approximately 6-8% and 17-26% of drug-related exposure, across studies (multiple dose study AC-058-
109 and AC-058-110 and single-dose studies AC058112, AC058113, AC058114, AC058108). However, 
the  mass  balance  study  AC-058-106  suggests  that  the  contribution  of  metabolite  M12  accounted  for 
more than 10% of the total radioactive dose administered when the fraction excreted in faeces is taken 
into  account.  Based  on  the  proposed  metabolic  pathway  in  humans,  M12  pathway  accounted  for 
approximately 19% of the total radioactive dose. M12 is formed by oxidation and M13 by truncation of 
the ethylene glycol side chain by 1 carbon and oxidation. Based on nonclinical studies, the formation of 
M12  involves  multiple  CYPs  (2J2,  3A4,  3A5,  4F3A,  and  4F12)  and  non-CYP  enzymes.  Ponesimod  also 
undergoes direct glucuronidation (mainly UGT1A1 and UGT2B7). CYP2J2 appears to be the main enzyme 
responsible for the formation of M12. In addition, several minor metabolites were identified in human 
plasma samples (M6, M8, M9, M10, M11, and M15). None of the metabolites is pharmacologically active. 
In the AC-058-106 study, the applicant states that 11 metabolites in the urine and one metabolite in the 
faeces are unidentified. The remaining unidentified fraction of the radioactivity are small peaks and are 
not identifiable. 
According  to  the  applicant,  data  from  plasma  pools  indicate  that  AUCinf  of  ponesimod  corresponds  to 
66.1%  of  total  drug-related  radioactive  exposure.  However,  median  AUCinf  of  ponesimod  from  pooled 
plasma samples is only 2,668 ng-eq*h/mL, whereas the median AUCinf of total plasma radioactivity is 
8954 ng-eq*h/mL. Furthermore, the median AUCinf of ponesimod obtained from plasma PK sampling is 
3930 ng·h/mL, which corresponds to approximately 44% of the AUCinf of total radioactivity in plasma. 
No additional radioactivity spikes, besides M12, M13 and Ponesimod, were registered.   
After administration of ponesimod (being in R-configuration), only a minor amount of S-enantiomer ACT-
128818 is formed, i.e., between 0.96 and 1.62% of the amount of ponesimod. This low amount has no 
impact on the conclusions from the PK and E-R analysis of ponesimod, and therefore, there is no need 
to use a chiral method for the analysis of ponesimod 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
After  single-dose  administration  to  healthy  subjects,  Cmax  and  AUCinf  of  ponesimod  increased 
approximately dose-proportionally across a dose range of 1 – 75 mg. After multiple-dose administration 
to  healthy  subjects,  slight  variation  in  outcome  was  observed;  however,  no  indication  for  a  clinically 
relevant deviation from dose-proportional PK was observed. In the Phase 2 study in subjects with MS, 
plasma concentrations ponesimod increased approximately dose-proportionally from 10 to 40 mg/day. 
The  linear  compartmental  model  in  the  popPK  analysis  described  the  data  sufficiently  well,  indicating 
that there is no reason to assume that there is a relevant deviation from dose-proportionality in the PK. 
In a multiple-dose study AC-058-102 in healthy subjects, a steady-state was achieved in approximately 
6  days.  In  the  absence  of  data  on  achievement  of  steady-state  after  up-titration,  the  original  popPK

model described by Lott 20171 was used to simulate the trough plasma concentration(Ctrough) during the 
up-titration  period  and  the  subsequent  multiple  administration  of  the  20  mg  QD  maintenance  dose 
(Figure  3).  Based  on  these  simulations,  it  is  concluded  that  90%  of  steady-state  is  achieved  after 
administration of 4 doses of the maintenance dose (day 18 from the start of the up-titration), while 95% 
of steady-state is reached after 5 doses of the maintenance dose (day 19).

The grey dot-dashed vertical line indicates the time of the first 20mg dose. The solid black line represents the median and the grey 
area represents the 90th prediction interval (i.e. 5th and 95th percentiles of simulated data) of 5000 stochastic simulations. The blue, 
green and red horizontal lines indicate 90%, 95% and 100% of steady state Ctrough, respectively; the corresponding blue and green 
vertical lines indicating the corresponding time of achievement after the start of the up-titration regimen.  
In  a  study  in  patients  with  RRMS,  no  relevant  accumulation  was  observed  from  168  hours  post-
administration onwards to week 24 following administration of 10–40 mg/day. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Low to moderate inter-subject variability was observed in healthy subjects, with coefficient of variation 
(CV) ranging 6 – 33% for ponesimod, 21 – 38% for M12 and 21 – 43% for M13. In line with this, in the 
popPK  study  D-16.437,  patients  were  included,  and  estimated  inter-subject  variability  was  low  to 
moderate  (10  –  28%)  regarding  the  apparent  central  and  peripheral  Vd,  the  apparent  inter-
compartmental  clearance  and  clearance.  It  was  higher  (41–57%)  regarding  the  absorption-related 
parameters.

Upon request, the applicant clarified that intra-subject variability could only be evaluated from 2 studies 
(n=12  for  each  formulation  in  AC-058-103  and  n=14  each  for  AC-058-108).  Based  on  the  presented 
data the intra-subject variability is estimated to be low, between 12-20%.  
Target population 
Based on interstudy comparisons, Ctrough values in patients at 20 mg/day were comparable to the values 
in healthy subjects. This was confirmed in the popPK analysis, where no clinically relevant effect of MS 
on the PK of ponesimod was found. In the population, PK study subjects with MS had a slight decrease 
in Cmax at steady state of 5% but Ctrough,ss were 4% higher in subjects with MS.   
Special populations 
Special population single-dose clinical pharmacology trials were performed in subjects with renal (AC-
058-113) or hepatic impairment (AC-058-112). The influence of race (Japanese vs. Caucasian) has been 
evaluated  in  study  (AC-058-107).  The  influence  of  other  covariates  on  exposure  has  been  evaluated 
using a popPK analysis. Covariates included in this  analysis were: sex, age race, ethnicity, BW, renal 
function, and hepatic impairment.

Renal impairment 
Ponesimod exposure did not significantly increase with the severity of renal impairment. Based on the 
results  of  study  AC-058-113,  no  dose  adjustments  are  needed  in  patients  with  mild  to  severe  renal 
impairment. These results are in line with the results of the mass balance study, in which was shown 
that renal elimination is a minor pathway. About 10-18% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine. 
In the popPK study, renal impairment had no effect on the PK of ponesimod.  
Hepatic impairment 
Ponesimod  is  extensively  metabolised  in  the  liver,  and  the  PK  of  ponesimod  and  its  metabolites  are 
affected by hepatic impairment. In phase I Study AC-058-112, the AUC and t1/2 of ponesimod and its 
metabolites  were  increased  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  compared  with  healthy  subjects. 
Hepatically impaired subjects of Child-Pugh class A showed a 1.3-fold (90% CI: 1.0-1.8), of Child-Pugh 
class B a 2.0-fold (1.5-2.7), and of Child-Pugh class C a 3.1-fold (2.2-4.3) increase in total ponesimod 
exposure (AUCinf) compared with healthy subjects. The respective geometric mean ratio of elimination 
t1/2  were  1.5  (90%  CI:  1.2  1.8),  1.8  (1.3-2.5),  and  2.6  (2.0-3.3),  indicating  reduced  clearance  of 
ponesimod.  
The  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  was  also  assessed  using  popPK  modelling.  A  pooled  data  set  was 
compiled  using  the  data  of  phase  I/II/  III  Studies,  with  a  total  number  of  subjects  of  1245  subjects, 
including  63  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment.  Different  classifications  were  used  to  identify  the 
hepatic impairment patients (Child-Pugh classification was used in the phase I study, and NCI-ODWG 
criteria were used in phase II and III studies). In patients with a mild hepatic impairment, the exposure 
(AUC) of ponesimod was increased by 12%. Limited clinical data are available on patients with class B 
(moderate) hepatic insufficiency. Only four patients with moderate hepatic impairment were included in 
the phase III study, and eight subjects received a single dose of ponesimod in the phase I study AC-
058-112. In these patients the exposure (AUC) of ponesimod was increased by 44%, however, these 
data should be interpreted with caution as only a limited number of clinical data are available on patients 
with moderate hepatic insufficiency. 
The effect of a mild hepatic impairment is 10-30%, slightly above normal subject variability. This is not 
expected to be clinically relevant so it can be agreed that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) as stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Section 4.3 of 
the  SmPC  also  states  that  ponesimod  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C, respectively). 
Gender 
No relevant gender effect was found for ponesimod. For the metabolites, M12 and M13, slightly higher 
Cmax and AUC0-24 values were observed for females compared to males in one of two studies in healthy 
subjects. This is not considered clinically relevant, since M12 and M13 are not pharmacologically active. 
Race  
In  a  phase  1  study,  the  exposure  to  ponesimod  (AUCinf  and  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve 
from time 0 to the last measurable concentration [AUC0-t]) after single-dose oral administration of 40 
mg ponesimod was about 15% higher in Japanese subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. Further, 
in  the  popPK  analysis  D-16.437,  estimated  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  during  a  dose 
interval (AUCτ) was 18% higher in black subjects (N=4) compared to white subjects due to the estimated 
lower clearance and the lower peripheral volume of distribution. In all cases, the effect of race, however, 
was within the range of the inter-subject variability and therefore considered as not clinically relevant. 
Dose adjustments based on race are not necessary.

Body weight 
No  dedicated  study  has  been  conducted  on  the  effect  of  BW  on  the  PK  of  ponesimod.  In  the  popPK 
analysis,  the  exposure  was  estimated  to  increase  with  lower  BW  and  to  decrease  with  higher  BW 
(approximately 30% difference in AUCτ over the 5–95th percentile of BW). The effect of BW on AUCτ of 
ponesimod was considered not clinically relevant, with the change in exposure upon lower or higher BW 
than  average  being  within  the  range  of  inter-subject  variability  (CV  14–33%).  Also  for  very  heavy 
patients (for instance with BW 150 kg), the exposure is still expected to be within the range of inter-
subject variability. Dose adjustments based on BW are not necessary. 
Age 
No specific study has been conducted on the effect of age on the PK of ponesimod. In the population, 
based  on  which  the  popPK  analysis  was  performed,  age  (18-65  year)  was  not  found  to  significantly 
influence  the  PK  of  ponesimod.  No  subjects  older  than  65  were  included  in  the  clinical  studies.  Upon 
request,  the  applicant  was  invited  to  update  the  SmPC  as  follows:  section  4.2  “Clinical  studies  of 
ponesimod  did  not  include  patients  aged  65  years  and  older.  Ponesimod  should  be  prescribed  with 
caution in patients aged 65 years and over due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy” and section 
5.2 “ponesimod has not been investigated in the elderly population (>65 years)”. Age was not a covariate 
in  the  popPK  model,  and  patients  over  55  years  old  were  in  general  not  included  in  the  studies  with 
ponesimod. However, due to the fact that the number of late-onset MS cases is increasing, and overall, 
the age of patients with MS will increase over time with the new treatment options, the applicant will be 
inquired further regarding this in the Safety part. Safety in the elderly is indicated as missing information 
in the RMP and will be followed post-marketing. 
Currently, there are no data in paediatric patients. A study in paediatric patients aged 10–18 years is 
planned. In the SmPC, it is stated that the safety and efficacy in children aged less than 18 years has 
not been established and that ponesimod is indicated in adult patients only. This is agreed. 
Interaction studies 
The interaction potential of ponesimod and its inactive metabolite M13 was investigated using in vitro 
tests. Although M12 is the most abundant metabolite in excreta, it has not been investigated in the in 
vitro interaction studies as the concentration of M12 is <10% of the total amount present in plasma. 
Based  on  in  vitro  tests  it  can  be  concluded  that  ponesimod  is  extensively  metabolised  and  several 
different enzymes are involved in the metabolism of ponesimod. Therefore, it is expected that the PK of 
ponesimod will not be affected by most inhibitors of metabolizing enzymes. The in vitro inhibition findings 
do not indicate a potential for clinically relevant inhibition risk for any of the CYPs or UGTs evaluated. 
Coadministration of strong inducers of multiple metabolic pathways may decrease the systemic exposure 
of ponesimod. It is unclear whether this decrease is clinically relevant. 
The  company  conducted  three  clinical  DDI  studies  and  two  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic 
simulations  to  identify  possible  interactions  with  CYP450  enzymes.  In  DDI  study  AC-058-104  no  PK 
interaction  was  observed  with  the  hormonal  contraceptive  of  Ortho-Novum  (containing  1  mg 
norethisterone/norethindrone and 35 μg ethinyl estradiol). DDI studies AC-058-111 (with atenolol and 
diltiazem) and AC-058-117 (with propranolol) were mainly designed to investigate cardiac safety. The 
effects on HR and rhythm were measured as the primary endpoint in these studies, and the effects on 
the  PK  were  analysed  as  a  secondary  objective.  No  significant  changes  in  the  PK  of  ponesimod  or 
propranolol  were  observed  in  study  AC-058-117.  Study  058-111  was  prematurely  terminated  due  to 
safety reasons. The PK of ponesimod, atenolol or diltiazem does not appear to be affected; however, it 
should be noted that the data are difficult to interpret due to very limited PK data available from this

study. Further, based on the PBPK simulations FK13357 and FK13637 no clinically significant interactions 
are expected between ponesimod and substrates of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. 
Ponesimod  displays  pH-dependent  dissolution.  The  applicant  has  not  investigated  nor  discussed  the 
potential  for  interaction  with  drugs  that  increase  gastric  pH  and  may  affect  the  dissolution  of  the 
ponesimod in vivo. Upon request, the applicant clarified that although ponesimod displays pH-dependent 
dissolution, the potential DDI risk of ponesimod with pH modulators is considered to be low. Ponesimod 
is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System class 2 drug, with low solubility over the physiological pH 
range,  with  absorption  being  driven  by  permeability,  rather  than  solubility.  This  is  supported  by  the 
limited effect of food on the PK of ponesimod. An analysis on the effect of antacids, using data collected 
in clinical studies B201 and B301 showed that steady-state concentrations of ponesimod were similar 
between subjects who received an antacid and subjects without antacid. Based on this no DDI study with 
a drug that increases gastric pH is required. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The applicant has not performed any dedicated pharmacology studies. Four PK studies, AC-058-105, AC-
058-110, AC-058-115 and AC-058-117 provided PD data on cardiac effects.  
Further PD data and PK/PD data is available from the Phase 2 dose-finding study AC-058B201 and the 
pivotal Phase 3 study AC-058B301.  
Three popPK/PD analyses were performed to investigate effects on peripheral lymphocytes counts, HR 
and  QTc.  E-R  modelling  based  on  data  from  the  dose-response  study  and  pivotal  Phase  3  study  was 
performed as well. 
Mechanism of action 
Ponesimod is a S1P modulator, with high affinity to S1P1 and selectivity for this receptor over other S1P. 
Ponesimod  leads  to  internalisation  of  the  S1P1  where  it  is  degraded  by  the  intracellular  proteasomal 
system. As a consequence, lymphocytes are deprived of the necessary signal to egress from lymphoid 
organs, leading to a reduction of circulating lymphocytes. T and B cells are most sensitive to ponesimod-
mediated sequestration. In contrast, monocyte, natural killer (NK) cell, and neutrophil counts are not 
reduced by ponesimod. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Ponesimod effect on peripheral lymphocytes counts 
Ponesimod induced a dose-related decrease in lymphocytes levels in the blood. No further decreases in 
lymphocyte  counts  were  observed  at  doses>60  mg/day.  The  maximal  reduction  in  total  lymphocytes 
observed  after  a  dose  of  20  mg/day  was  74%,  and  the  reduction  observed  at  Ctrough  was  59%.  The 
decrease in lymphocytes was reversible after 3–10 days. Effects on T-helper cells, cytotoxic T cells and 
regulatory  T  cells  and  on  B  cells  were  generally  comparable  to  the  effect  on  total  lymphocytes.  No 
relevant decrease in NK cells was observed (compared to placebo). The effect on cytotoxic T cells was 
slightly less than on T-helper cells and B cells.  
The PK/PD of the effect of ponesimod on lymphocytes levels was characterised based on data in healthy 
subjects, using an indirect-response model, which was based on the popPK model, supplemented with 
the appearance of lymphocytes in blood following a zero-order process and disappearance from blood 
according  to  a  first-order  process.  In  general,  parameters  were  estimated  with  adequate  precision,

except  for  effect  on  NK  cells,  which  can  be  explained  by  the  lack  of  a  clear  effect  on  NK  cells.  The 
applicant clarified that a limited number of outliers was excluded from the analysis. The exclusions were 
due  to  conditional  weighted  residuals  being  >  6.  This  was  in  accordance  with  the  analysis  plan.  A 
decrease in the baseline of lymphocytes was predicted with increasing age, but no effect of age on the 
relative change from baseline was predicted. The effects of sex and BW on the model were predicted to 
be negligible. Maximum predicted reduction in total lymphocytes was 87%. Simulating dosing scenarios 
with the PK/PD model showed that only a further reduction of 8% was observed when increasing the 
dose from 20 to 40 mg. When the dose was increased from 40 mg to 100 mg, a further reduction of 4–
6% was observed. The predicted effect on cytotoxic T cells was slightly less than on T-helper cells and 
B cells, as was found in the studies. The PK/PD model was successfully applied to the data from studies 
AC-058B201 and AC-058B301, indicating that no differences are to be expected in the ponesimod effect 
on total lymphocyte counts between healthy subjects and subjects with MS.  
In both clinical studies in patients with RMS (B201 and B301), a rapid decline in peripheral lymphocyte 
counts was observed, which remained thereafter stable until treatment withdrawal. Upon request, the 
applicant clarified that the percentage of subjects with lymphocyte counts above 0.8x109/L was 37.9% 
(11/29), 84.6% (11/13) and 98.5% (202/205) in study B301, by FU Day 2, FU day 5 and FU day 15, 
respectively (Figure 5). Similar results were seen in study B201. This indicates that lymphocyte count 
indeed returns to normal for the majority of subjects within 2 weeks.

≥0.8 * 109/L, by Post-Treatment Day 
Only central laboratory results (scheduled and unscheduled) are included. Last on treatment: latest treatment-emergent assessment 
prior to or on the day after last study drug intake. n consists of subjects with post-treatment lymphocyte count available on each post 
treatment timepoint. 
In the dose-response study B201, the reduction in lymphocyte counts generally needed for therapeutic 
response, i.e. approximately 70%, was reached with the 20 mg and 40 mg doses. This supports omitting 
the 10 mg dose from further studies. 
Ponesimod effect on heart rate 
Ponesimod induces a transient, dose-dependent decrease in HR, which is more prominent on the first 
day  of  ponesimod  dosing.  The  negative  chronotropic  effect  disappears  due  to  the  S1P1  receptor 
internalisation in cardiomyocytes induced by ponesimod initial doses resulting in tolerance.

Effect of up-titration regimen of ponesimod on HR and rhythm 
Study AC-058-115 was conducted to investigate and optimise the ponesimod up-titration regimen. Two 
up-titration regimens were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 2-way crossover 
study  in  32  healthy  subjects  (active:  placebo  ratio  of  3:1).  The  gradual  up-titration  regimen  with  a 
starting dose of 2 mg later used in Studies B301/B303 was designated regimen A, and the regimen with 
a  starting  dose  of  10  mg  used  in  Studies  B201/B202  was  designated  regimen  B.  The  first  dose  of 
ponesimod (Day 2) resulted in a transient decrease in mean hourly HR from baseline. The decrease as 
assessed by Holter and 12-lead ECG was greater with treatment regimen B (maximum mean decrease: 
12 bpm and 13 bpm, respectively) than with regimen A (6 bpm and 9 bpm, respectively) and placebo 
(0 bpm and 4 bpm, respectively). These maximum mean decreases occurred 2–3 h postdose and mean 
hourly  HR  had  returned  to  predose  values  by  4–5  h  postdose.  No  further  postdose  decrease  in  mean 
hourly HR was observed on Day 3 and later study days in either regimen. The proportion of subjects who 
experienced an AV block (defined as PR >210 ms) was 25% for all treatment groups. However, the total 
number of occurrences of any AV block was largest during regimen B (143) followed by regimen A (79) 
and placebo (33). The maximum observed PR intervals were 222 ms (Day –1, predose), 236 ms (Day 
4, 3 h), and 220 ms (Day -1, 2 h) in regimen A, B, and placebo, respectively. 
Modelling for ponesimod effect on HR and rhythm 
A PK/PD model, including an HR baseline with circadian oscillation, the direct effect of ponesimod on HR 
decrease,  and  the  development  of  tolerance  during  up-titration  (modulated  by  ponesimod  plasma 
concentrations), described the effect of ponesimod on HR and its variability observed in the data from 9 
Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. 
Modelling indicated that after 1 week of treatment with ponesimod at 20 mg/day, the tolerance effect is 
almost  fully  (>90%)  developed;  this  was  consistent  with  observed  predose  HRs  in  subjects  receiving 
ponesimod treatment being similar to the baseline (i.e., prior to any ponesimod dosing) values observed 
in the Phase 2b Study B201. 
With the exception of baseline HR, no clinically relevant effects of other covariates (age, sex, race, and 
body size) on ponesimod effects on HR were identified in healthy subjects or subjects with MS. 
With  the  gradual  up-titration  of  ponesimod  dose  used  in  Study  B301,  no  HR  ≤40  bpm  cases  were 
observed  in  subjects  with  HR  at  baseline  ≥55  bpm.  This  finding  supports  the  recommendation  of  HR 
monitoring after the first ponesimod dose only in subjects with a baseline HR<55 bpm. The incidence of 
marked bradycardia (HR ≤40 bpm) after the first 2 mg dose was 0.53% (lower than that observed in 
Study B201 with the first dose of 10 mg, 0.89%) and no HR ≤40 bpm was observed in the subsequent 
days of up-titration. 
Simulation results also indicated that after treatment discontinuation lasting up to 3 days either during 
up-titration  or  at  maintenance  dosing,  ponesimod  dosing  could  be  resumed  without  the  need  of 
reinitiating the up-titration, while if treatment is discontinued for 4 or more days, ponesimod up-titration 
should be reinitiated from the starting dose of 2 mg to minimise the HR effects. This recommendation is 
valid for subjects with normal and mildly impaired hepatic. 
Ponesimod effect on QT interval 
In Study AC-058-110, after multiple-dose administration of ponesimod at supratherapeutic doses of 40 
and 100 mg as tablets in healthy subjects, ponesimod caused QTc prolongation, with a mean peak effect 
on the placebo-corrected change from baseline in the individually corrected QT (ΔΔQTcI) of 6.9 ms on 
40 mg ponesimod and 9.1 ms on 100 mg ponesimod. Graphical exploration of the data indicated a lack 
of delayed effects. The concentration-effect modelling confirmed the findings of a QT prolongation caused 
by ponesimod: the upper limits of the 2-sided 90% CI of the ΔΔQTcI were 6.73 and 9.52 at 40 mg and 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 56/136 
 
  
 
 
100 mg, respectively. The extrapolation of the model results to the proposed therapeutic 20 mg dose of 
ponesimod, provided an upper limit of the 2-sided 90% CIs of 5.9 ms. In the Phase 3 study, B301, mean 
changes from baseline to Week 108 in QT corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ranged from 1.8 to 
5.2 ms in the ponesimod 20 mg group. 
Pulmonary effect of ponesimod 
Ponesimod, administered at 20 mg daily dose in the Phase 3 Study B301, led to an exposure dependent 
reduction  of  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  (FEV1),  mostly  occurring  in  the  first  month  after 
treatment initiation. The net (i.e., discounted of the effect of teriflunomide treatment) model-predicted 
effect led to a 5.5% decrease compared to baseline at the median AUC of 3,687 ng/mL. This net effect 
is consistent with the 5% reduction on FEV1 observed in Study B201 at the same dose level. As expected, 
and also consistent with findings in B201, significant effects of sex, age, race, and baseline expanded 
disability status scale (EDSS) on FEV1 at baseline were found, however, since none of these covariates 
was associated with the  magnitude of ponesimod  effect on FEV1, dosage adjustments on the basis of 
these  covariates  is  not  warranted.  In  addition,  there  were  significant  effects  of  age  and  BW  on  the 
ponesimod effect, where the effect of ponesimod on FEV1 increases with increasing BW and decreases 
with increasing age. 
Exposure-response modelling 
Study B201 
E-R analysis of the cumulative sum of new gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions between Week 12 and 
24 as well as ARR was performed on data from the dose-response study B201. Graphical exploration and 
regression  analysis  were  used  to  model  the  relationship  between  metrics  of  systemic  exposure  to 
ponesimod (AUC and lymphocyte decrease) and the efficacy and safety endpoints. The potential effect 
of baseline covariates (age, sex, BW, race, Gd+ lesions, and EDSS) was also explored.  
The E-R modelling on data from the dose-response study B201 demonstrated a clear E-R relationship in 
terms of Gd+ lesions. The predicted decrease in cumulative new Gd+ lesions plateaus at around 5000 
ng·h/mL, suggesting only a small additional benefit of doses higher than 20 mg QD.  
The  model  predicted  an  additional  decrease  of  approximately  10%  in  ARR  with  the  40  mg  dose  as 
compared  to  20  mg  could  be  considered  substantial.  However,  based  on  the  clear  dose-response 
relationship in AE, this additional benefit is not considered such that would justify the 40 mg dose.  
Study B301 
E-R  analysis  of  the  CUAL  and  ARR  was  performed  on  data  from  the  pivotal  study  B301.  Graphical 
exploration and regression analysis for count data were used to characterise the relationship between 
ponesimod exposure and these endpoints, and the potential effect of baseline covariates (age, sex, BW, 
race, T1, EDSS and former use of DMT) was also explored. 
The E-R modelling suggests a clear E-R in terms of CUALs within the exposure range observed for 20 
mg maintenance dose of ponesimod. Based on indirect comparison, within the usual range of exposures 
of this dose, the E-R relationship in terms of ARR is rather flat.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  general,  the  bioanalytical  methods  used  to  determine  the  concentrations  ponesimod  and  its 
metabolites M12 and M13 were acceptable. Although the middle QC sample (both validation and during 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 57/136 
 
  
 
 
 
the analysis of study samples) does not comply with the recommendation in EMA guideline (30-50% of 
the  upper  limit  of  quantification  [ULQC]),  considering  the  actually  found  concentration  level  in  trial 
samples the chosen middle QC lower than 50% of ULQC covers the obtained results in most of the studies 
and is more suitable. No question was raised regarding this aspect. In general, the inter- and intra-assay 
precision and accuracy for all assays of ponesimod in human plasma were within the acceptance criteria 
for the chosen QC samples. Incurred sample reanalysis analyses have been applied for the major part 
of  the  studies,  and  the  results  were  within  the  acceptance  criteria  recommended  by  EMA  guideline. 
Information on the potential influence of other drugs on the assay performance has been provided for 
none of the bioanalytical validation reports that have been used for the determination of ponesimod in 
plasma.  The  applicant  has  justified  that  based  on  the  molecular  weight  no  MS/MS  interference  is 
anticipated  between  concomitant  medication  and  ponesimod,  its  internal  standard  and  its  main 
metabolites M12 and M13.  
The PK of ponesimod have been studied adequately. Ponesimod is absorbed well after oral administration 
(84%)  and  is  widely  distributed  into  tissues.  Ponesimod  is  excreted  for  the  major  part  in  faeces  (57-
80%) and for a minor part in urine (10-18%).  
Estimated inter-subject variability was low to moderate (10–28%) regarding the apparent central and 
peripheral  Vd,  the  apparent  inter-compartmental  clearance  and  clearance.  It  was  higher  (41–57%) 
regarding the absorption-related parameters. There were only a limited number of Phase 1 studies in 
which subjects received replicate doses of ponesimod; therefore, intra-subject variability could only be 
evaluated from 2 studies based on which, intra-subject variability is estimated to be low, between 12-
20%. 
The  to  be  registered  formulation  is  an  immediate-release  tablet.  In  the  clinical  studies,  patients  were 
instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The effect of chewing, crushing, or suspending the tablets was 
not evaluated in a formal study. Despite of this, patients with swallowing problems do not need to swallow 
the tablet whole, as no clinically significant crushing effects are expected from the Quality or PK point of 
view  based  on  the  composition  of  the  products  and  the  PK  of  different  formulations  observed  during 
clinical development. 
In clinical phase 3 study, the to-be-marketed tablets were overencapsulated. Overencapsulation can be 
accepted based on cross-study comparison. Cross-study comparisons indicate that ponesimod exposure 
from  the  overencapsulated  tablet  used  in  the  Phase  3  study  (AC-058B301)  is  consistent  with  the 
exposure in a Phase 1 study (AC-058-115) with the non-overencapsulated tablet. 
About 10-20% of the administered dose is eliminated renally, and renal impairment did not affect the 
PK  of  ponesimod.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustments  are  needed  in  patients  with  mild  to  severe  renal 
impairment. The effect of dialysis on the PK of ponesimod has not been studied. Due to the high plasma-
protein binding of ponesimod lack of effect in severe renal impairment, no dose-adjustment is anticipated 
in patients undergoing haemodialysis. 
Ponesimod  is  extensively  metabolised,  and  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  had  a  substantially 
increased  exposure  of  ponesimod.  After  a  single  10  mg  oral  dose  of  ponesimod,  subjects  with  mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) showed a 1.3-fold, moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class  B)  a  2.0  fold,  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  C)  a  3.1-fold  increase  in  total 
ponesimod exposure (AUCinf) compared to healthy subjects (Study AC-058-112).  
The  10-30%  increase  of  ponesimod  exposure  observed  in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (in 
Study AC-058-112 and population PK study) was not expected to be clinically relevant. However, upon 
request, the applicant provided an additional analysis of the data available on patients with mild hepatic 
impairment to support that ponesimod 20mg can be safely used in this subpopulation. A pooled data set 
was compiled using the data of phase 1/2/3 Studies, with a total number of subjects of 1,245 subjects 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 58/136 
 
  
 
 
including 63 patients with mild hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh Criteria (55 subjects classified 
based on the National Cancer Institute - Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria). The exposure (AUC) 
of  ponesimod  increased  by  12%  in  these  patients.  No  dose  adjustment  is necessary  for  patients  with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) as stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Standard monitoring 
of safety risks is expected to be sufficient for patients with mild hepatic impairment. SmPC section 4.4 
clearly states that monitoring of several safety parameters is required, precautions include monitoring 
of liver function tests to detect worsening of hepatic dysfunction in an early stage. Limited clinical data 
are available on patients with class B (moderate) hepatic insufficiency. Only four patients were included 
in the phase 3 Study, and eight subjects received a single dose of ponesimod in the phase I study AC-
058-112. Current population PK dataset is too limited to recommend dose adaptations and to assess the 
B/R  ratio  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  insufficiency.  Therefore,  ponesimod  is  not  recommended 
treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Ponesimod is contraindicated in patients with 
severe  hepatic  impairment  due  to  the  3-fold  increase  in  exposure  of  ponesimod  and  the  risk  of 
hepatobiliary disorders/liver enzyme abnormalities (see clinical safety). 
In  vitro  studies  showed  that  ponesimod  and  its  metabolite  M13  have  a  low  potential  for  interactions. 
Although M12 is the most abundant metabolite in excreta, it has not been investigated in the in vitro 
interaction studies as the concentration of M12 is <10% of the total amount present in plasma. Further, 
although the clinical drug interaction studies AC-058-104 and AC-058-117 were not specifically designed 
to  investigate  specific  model  substrates,  these  studies  support  that  the  risk  of  PK  drug  interactions 
related to CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is low. The applicant has not evaluated whether ponesimod is a substrate 
for transporters but adequately justified that no clinically relevant transporter interactions are expected. 
No  clinically  relevant  interaction  with  the  hepatic  uptake  transporters  OCT1,  OCT3  and  hepatic  efflux 
transporter  MATE-1  is  expected  based  on  limited  amount  of  unchanged  drug  eliminated  via  hepatic 
secretion, the good passive cell permeability of ponesimod and non-clinical study results that indicate 
the lack of involvement of active transport into the hepatocytes. No clinically relevant interaction with 
the renal uptake transporters OCT3, OAT1 and OAT3, and efflux transporter MATE2K are expected as 
ponesimod is not excreted renally (<1% of administered dose). 
Although ponesimod displays pH-dependent dissolution, the CHMP agreed with the applicant position 
that the potential DDI risk of ponesimod with pH modulators is considered to be low and therefore, no 
DDI study with a drug that increases gastric pH is required. 
No dedicated PD studies were performed. PD data and PK/PD data are available from the Phase 2 dose-
finding study AC-058B201 and the pivotal Phase 3 study AC-058B30, and in addition, four PK studies 
provided PD data on cardiac effects.  
Ponesimod  is an S1P modulator, with high affinity to S1P1 and selectivity for this receptor over other 
S1P. Ponesimod leads to internalisation of the S1P1 receptor  where it is degraded  by the intracellular 
proteasomal system. As a consequence, lymphocytes (T and B cells) are deprived of the necessary signal 
to egress from lymphoid organs, leading to a reduction of circulating lymphocytes. T and B cells are most 
sensitive  to  ponesimod-mediated  sequestration.  In  contrast,  monocyte,  natural  killer  (NK)  cell,  and 
neutrophil  counts  are  not reduced  by  ponesimod.  The  mechanism  of  action  is  sufficiently  studied  and 
described.  
Ponesimod  induced  a  dose-related  decrease  in  lymphocytes  levels  in  the  blood.  Observed  maximal 
reduction at 20 mg/day was 74%. Maximum predicted reduction in the PK/PD model in total lymphocytes 
was 87%. In the PK/PD model, parameters were estimated with adequate precision, except for NK cells, 
which  were  not  clearly  affected  by  ponesimod.  A  limited  number  of  outliers  was  excluded  from  the 
analysis. The exclusions were due to conditional weighted residuals being > 6. This was in accordance 
with the Analysis Plan.  
Assessment report

The effects described above were confirmed in both clinical studies in patients with RMS, where a rapid 
decline in peripheral lymphocyte counts was observed, which remained thereafter stable until treatment 
withdrawal.  Lymphocyte  counts  returned  close  to  baseline  values  within  one  month  after  stopping 
treatment. For the majority of subjects, lymphocyte counts return to normal within 2 weeks. 
In the dose-response study B201, the reduction in lymphocyte counts generally needed for therapeutic 
response, i.e. approximately 70%, was reached with the 20 mg and 40 mg doses. This supports rejecting 
the 10 mg dose from further studies. 
The E-R modelling on data from the dose-response study B201 demonstrated a clear E-R relationship in 
terms  of  Gd+  lesions.  The  predicted  decrease  in  cumulative  new  Gd+  lesions  suggests  only  a  small 
additional  benefit  of  higher  than  20 mg  doses.  The  additional  decrease  of approximately  10%  in ARR 
with the 40 mg dose as compared to 20 mg can be considered substantial; however, based on the clear 
dose-response relationship in AE, this additional benefit is not considered such that would justify the 40 
mg dose. Also, the E-R modelling based on data from study B301 suggests a clear exposure-response in 
terms of CUALs within the exposure range observed for 20 mg maintenance dose of ponesimod.  
Bradycardia and AV block are known secondary pharmacological effects of S1P modulators. Therefore 
an  up-titration  regimen  should  be  used.  The  applicant  investigated  two  up-titration  regimens,  one 
starting at 2mg dose and one with a starting dose of 10mg. The applicant also constructed a popPK/PD 
model based on the phase 1 studies, which included 280 healthy subjects, with 9529 ponesimod plasma 
concentrations and 42,559 HR measurements. This is sufficient to accurately design a popPK/PD model. 
This model is used to substantiate the proposed up-titration regimen and to include safety warnings on 
concomitant with beta-blockers.  
Overall, it is agreed with the applicant that the effect of ponesimod on the HR is dose-dependent. The 
applicant concluded that gradual up-titration leads to a reduced risk of bradycardia due to development 
of tolerance can also be agreed. However, for this conclusion also the safety data from the phase 2 and 
3 study has to be taken into account. In the SmPC, the applicant proposes a warning for subjects with a 
baseline HR ≤55bpm based on the simulation. This warning in section 4.4 can be supported. 
Ponesimod  shows  a  reduction  of  FEV1  in  dose  and  exposure-related  manner.  In  addition,  an  effect  of 
sex, age, race and baseline EDSS was observed on the FEV1. However, it is agreed with the applicant 
that no dose adjustment is required for sex, age, race and baseline EDSS, as these were not associated 
with the magnitude of the effect of ponesimod on FEV1. However, long-term treatment with ponesimod 
poses a risk, particularly in respiratory compromised subjects. Therefore, a warning in relation with the 
effect on pulmonary function has been included in the SmPC and bronchoconstriction has been added as 
important identified risk in the risk management plan (RMP). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of ponesimod and its metabolites has been adequately characterised in healthy volunteers and 
the intended patient population.  
The mechanism of action of ponesimod is adequately described, and its effects on lymphocytes, HR and 
pulmonary function addressed. The proposed clinical dose of ponesimod 20 mg preceded by 14 days of 
titration was documented.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study B201 was a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, dose-finding study, in which efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 3 doses of ponesimod (10, 20, or 
40 mg) administered for 24 weeks were investigated in subjects with RRMS. The dose selection for this 
study was based on both efficacy and safety considerations, based on data from Phase 1 single-ascending

and multiple-ascending dose studies. In this study, dose increments were performed in a weekly interval 
for patients randomised in the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. 
The  study  included  patients  aged  18  to  55  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  RRMS  according  to  the  revised 
(2005) McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS. Patients were required to have ≥1 documented relapse(s) 
within 12 months prior to screening or ≥2 documented relapses within 24 months prior to screening or 
at least 1 Gd+ lesion detected on T1-weighted MRI (central reading) at screening. EDSS score of 0 to 
5.5 (inclusive) at screening was required. Both treatment-naïve and patients previously treated with IFN 
beta-1a, IFN beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab, were eligible to enrol in the study. The study 
population  consisted  solely  of  RRMS  patients;  this  is  considered  acceptable  for  demonstrating  effect 
primarily in an MRI endpoint. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions per patient on T1-weighted 
MRI scans at Weeks 12 to 24. Secondary endpoints included ARR and time to first confirmed relapse. An 
MRI primary endpoint is accepted for a dose-response study.  
464 patients were randomised to the study, with 108, 116, 119, and 121 patients randomised to the 
ponesimod 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and placebo groups, respectively (Table 5).  
The mean cumulative numbers of new Gd+ lesions from Weeks 12 to 24 were 3.5, 1.1, 1.4 and 6.2 in 
the  ponesimod  10  mg,  ponesimod  20  mg,  ponesimod  40  mg  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  The 
treatment  effect  (ratio)  vs.  placebo  with  ponesimod  10  mg  was  0.566  (95%  CIs:  0.337,  0.952,  P  = 
0.0318), with ponesimod 20 mg it was 0.170 (95% CIs: 0.100, 0.289, P < 0.0001), and with ponesimod 
40 mg it was 0.226 (95% CIs: 0.133, 0.384, P < 0.0001). 
The  estimated  ARR  (confirmed  relapses)  within  24  weeks  of  study  drug  initiation  was  lower  in  the 
ponesimod groups compared to placebo. The treatment effect (ratio) vs placebo with ponesimod 10 mg 
was 0.632 (95% CIs: 0.332, 1.202, p = 0.1619), with ponesimod 20 mg it was 0.793 (95% CIs: 0.440, 
1.432, p 0.4420),  and with ponesimod 40 mg it was 0.478 (95% CIs: 0.240, 0.954, p = 0.0363). 
Up-titration regimens 
Activation  of  S1P1  receptors  during  initiation  of  treatment  with  ponesimod  leads  to  dose-dependent 
transient HR decrease and infrequently delay in AV conduction. In the presence of ponesimod, this initial 
receptor  activation  is  followed  by  desensitisation  of  the  S1P1  system  in  cardiomyocytes  leading  to 
normalisation of HR and rhythm. These initial effects on HR and AV conduction are mitigated by initiating 
treatment with a low dose (2 mg) of ponesimod, followed by a gradual up-titration to the maintenance 
dose (20 mg). 
Study 115 in healthy volunteers was conducted to investigate and optimise the ponesimod up-titration 
regimen. Two up-titration regimens were compared in a DB, placebo-controlled, randomised, two-way 
crossover study in 32 subjects (active: placebo ratio of 3:1). The gradual up-titration regimen with a 
starting dose of 2 mg later used in Studies B301/B303 was designated regimen A, and an up-titration 
regimen with a starting dose of 10 mg used in Studies B201/B202 was designated regimen B. 
The first dose of ponesimod (Day 2) resulted in a transient decrease in mean hourly HR from baseline 
as assessed by Holter (Figure 6). The decrease was greater with treatment regimen B (maximum mean 
decrease: 12 bpm) than with regimen A (6 bpm) and placebo (0 bpm). These maximum mean decreases 
occurred 2–3 h postdose and mean hourly HR had returned to predose values by 4–5 h postdose. On 
Day 3, the decrease in mean hourly HR from predose induced by ponesimod was similar or smaller when 
compared to Day 2, and there was no longer a difference between regimens A and B (in absolute and 
relative terms). For both regimens, the predose mean hourly HR values on Day 3 and later were 5 to 10 
bpm lower when compared to baseline and remained lower during the complete ponesimod treatment

period. Taking this decrease in predose values into account, no further postdose decrease in mean hourly 
HR was observed on Day 3 and later study days in either regimen. 
Figure 6: Mean (SD) hourly Holter HR data over Days-1 to 3 (Per protocol set) (Ponesimod 
Protocol:AC-058-115) 
For the placebo group, data from periods1 and 2 are pooled together.  
Similar effects of ponesimod on HR were observed with 12-lead ECGs. The maximum mean decreases 
from baseline in HR on Day 2 (after the first dose of ponesimod) were 13 bpm for regimen B, 9 bpm for 
regimen A, and 4 bpm for placebo, and occurred 2 h after administration in all treatment groups. 
HR values of interest (HR <45 bpm, and/or decrease from baseline in HR of >20 bpm from 12 lead ECG) 
were recorded more frequently in ponesimod-treated subjects when compared to placebo (12-lead ECG, 
HR  <45  bpm;  regimen  A:  12.5%  of  subjects,  regimen  B:  16.7%,  placebo:  0%  /  HR  decrease  from 
baseline >20 bpm; regimen A: 8.3%, regimen B: 8.3%, placebo: 6.3%). HR<45 bpm and decrease from 
baseline  of  >20  bpm  following  the  first  ponesimod  dose  occurred  more  frequently  during  regimen  B 
(16.7%) than regimen A (4.2%). Whereas 3 subjects during regimen B experienced an HR value <40 
bpm,  no  such  values  were  recorded  during  regimen  A  or  placebo.  Similar  results  were  obtained  from 
Holter. 
The percentage of subjects (events), with PR interval values ≥200 ms was 29.2% (221), 29.2% (258), 
and 25.0% (112) in regimen A, B, and placebo, respectively. The percentage of subjects (events), with 
an  increase  from  baseline  in  PR  interval  of  >20  ms  was  25.0%  (63),  33.3%  (44),  and  18.8%  (8)  in 
regimen A, B, and placebo, respectively. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  an  AV  block  (defined  as  PR  >210  ms)  was  25%  for  all 
treatment groups. However, the total number of occurrences of any AV block was largest during regimen 
B (143) followed by regimen A (79) and placebo (33). The maximum observed PR intervals were 222 
ms (Day -1, predose), 236 ms (Day 4, 3 h), and 220 ms (Day -1, 2 h) in regimen A, B, and placebo, 
respectively. 
For the placebo group, the occurrence of any AV block appeared to be evenly distributed over the study 
days whereas, for both regimens A and B, most AV blocks were observed during the first 6 8 days of 
treatment with ponesimod. Second degree AV block Mobitz I was observed (12 lead ECG) in 1 subject 
during regimen B (Day 9, predose, second period) and in 2 subjects in the placebo treatment group. No

second-degree AV block Mobitz I was observed during ponesimod treatment in regimen A. In addition, 
1 AE of second-degree AV block Mobitz I on Day 1 during the night following administration of placebo 
during regimen A (from Holter) was reported. 
Fewer and less pronounced ponesimod-related cardiodynamic effects were observed in the gradual up-
titration  regimen  starting  with  ponesimod  2  mg  compared  to  the  up-titration  regimen  starting  with 
ponesimod 10 mg. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study AC-058B301 (B301) 
Methods 
Study B301 was a multicentre, randomised, DB, parallel-group, active-controlled, superiority study to 
compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ponesimod  to  teriflunomide  in  subjects  with  Relapsing  Multiple 
Sclerosis. 
The study included three periods: a pre-randomisation period of up to 45 days, a treatment period of 
108 weeks and a follow-up phase of 30 days. 
Study Participants  
The key inclusion criteria were 
•  Males and females aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive). 
• 
Presenting with a diagnosis of MS as defined by the revised (2010) McDonald Diagnostic Criteria 
for MS with relapsing course from onset (i.e. RRMS, or SPMS with superimposed relapses). 
•  Subjects who had experienced one or more documented MS attacks with onset within the period 
of 12 to 1 months prior to baseline EDSS assessment, or two or more documented MS attacks 
with onset within the period of 24 to 1 months prior to baseline EDSS assessment, or had one 
or more Gd+ lesion(s) of the brain on an MRI performed within 6 months prior to baseline EDSS 
assessment (MRI assessed at Visit 2 [Baseline] could be the qualifying scan). 
• 
Treatment-naïve  or  previously  treated  with  IFN  beta-1a,  IFN  beta-1b,  glatiramer  acetate, 
natalizumab, or dimethyl fumarate.  
•  Ambulatory and with an EDSS score between  0 and 5.5 (inclusive) at Visit 1 (Screening) and 
Visit 2 (Baseline). 
•  Subject who agreed to use an accelerated elimination procedure for teriflunomide after the last 
dose of study drug. 
The key exclusion criteria were 
• 
Lactating or pregnant women.  
•  Subjects with a diagnosis of MS with progressive course from onset (i.e. primary progressive or 
progressive relapsing MS). 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 64/136 
 
  
 
 
•  Subjects  with  significant  medical  conditions  or  receiving  therapies  for  such  conditions  (e.g. 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, hepatic, ophthalmological, ocular, and malignancy) 
were not eligible to enter the study. 
•  Subjects with contraindications to MRI or with clinically relevant medical or surgical conditions 
that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk by participating in the study 
were not eligible to enter the study. 
•  Subjects who were unlikely to comply with the protocol were not eligible to enter the study. 
Treatments 
Subjects  who  met  all  inclusion  criteria  and  none  of  the  exclusion  criteria  were  randomised  to  either 
ponesimod or teriflunomide treatment. 
During Days 1 to 14 (up-titration period), one tablet of ponesimod 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mg (or 
matching  placebo)  was  to  be  taken  orally  once  daily.  The  matching  placebos  for  these  doses  were 
supplied as identical tablets. During the maintenance period (Day 15 until end of treatment [EOT]), one 
over-encapsulated tablet of ponesimod 20 mg was to be taken orally once daily. 
The up-titration phase of the study was conducted in a double-dummy fashion, while the maintenance 
phase was active-controlled without a double-dummy design. 
To  accelerate  the  reduction  of  teriflunomide  plasma  concentrations  at  the  end  of  DB  treatment,  all 
subjects underwent an accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure at end-of-treatment (EOT), using 
either  cholestyramine  or  activated  charcoal.  Due  to  blinding,  all  subjects,  including  those  who  had 
received ponesimod 20 mg treatment, underwent this procedure. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  whether  ponesimod  is  more  efficacious  than 
teriflunomide in terms of reducing relapses in subjects with RMS. 
Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of  ponesimod on disability accumulation  and on other 
aspects of MS disease control, and to assess the safety and tolerability of ponesimod in subjects with 
RMS. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ARR  up  to  EOS,  defined  as  the  number  of  confirmed  relapses 
according to the treating neurologist/principal investigator per subject-year. 
A relapse was defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that occurred at least 30 
days after the onset of a preceding relapse, and that lasted at least 24 hours, in the absence of fever or 
infection. A relapse was confirmed by the treating neurologist only when the subjects’ symptoms were 
accompanied by an increase in EDSS/ Functional Systems [FS] scores, which was consistent with the 
subject’s symptoms, from a previous clinically stable EDSS/FS assessment (i.e., performed at least 30 
days after the onset of any previous relapse), obtained by the efficacy assessor and consistent with the 
following: 
•  An increase of at least half a step (0.5 points; unless EDSS=0, then an increase of at least 1.0 
points was required) or 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 65/136 
 
  
 
 
•  An increase of at least 1.0 point in at least two FS scores, or 
•  An increase of at least 2.0 points in at least one FS score (excluding bladder/bowel and cerebral). 
The secondary efficacy variables were: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 108 in fatigue-related symptoms as measured by the symptoms 
domain of the FSIQ–RMS (a Patient-Reported Outcome [PRO] developed by the applicant]. 
•  CUALs from baseline to Week 108. 
• 
• 
Time to 12-week CDA from baseline to EOS. 
Time to 24-week CDA from baseline to EOS. 
Several MRI based and exploratory clinical endpoints were defined, including for example the percent 
change  in  brain  volume  from  baseline  to  Week  108,  the  cumulative  number  of  new  or  enlarging  T2 
lesions from baseline to Week 108, time to first confirmed relapse, change from baseline by visit up to 
Week 108 in EDSS and No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA)-3 and NEDA-4 status up to end of the 
study. NEDA-3 was defined as absence of confirmed relapse, Gd+ lesions, new or enlarging T2 lesions, 
and 12-week CDA from baseline up to the specified time point. NEDA-4 adds no brain volume change.  
Sample size 
The sample size for the study was estimated by simulation using negative binomial (NB) distribution. 
A sample size of 1100 subjects (550 per treatment group) provides a power of approximately 90% for a 
significance level of 0.01, under the assumption that ARR is 0.320 for teriflunomide 14 mg and 0.215 for 
ponesimod 20 mg (which corresponds to a rate reduction of 33%) and using a dispersion=0.9. An annual 
dropout rate of approximately 15% was assumed for the first year and 7.5% for the second year. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  ponesimod  or  teriflunomide  based  on  a 
computer-generated randomisation schedule. The randomisation was balanced by using permuted blocks 
of 6 subjects per block.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study drug blinding 
The investigator and study staff, the subjects, the monitors, all sponsor Clinical Trial Team members and 
CROs involved in the conduct of the study remained blinded to the treatment until study closure. The 
investigational  treatment  and  active  comparator,  and  their  respective  matching  placebos  (during  the 
initial  up-titration  stage  when  study  drug  treatments  were  administered  in  a  double-dummy  fashion) 
were indistinguishable, and all subject kits were packaged in the same way. 
Functional blinding 
First-dose  effects  on  HR  and  AV  conduction,  lymphocyte  count  reduction,  and  teriflunomide  plasma 
concentration were identified as potentially unblinding information. After administration of the first dose 
on Day 1 and on the first day of re-initiation of study drug, post-dose monitoring was performed by an 
independent first-dose administrator.  
Data  including  ECG  variables,  blood  pressure  and  AEs  (if  applicable)  were  reported  in  a  separate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) and processed by independent data managers and statisticians. The 
Assessment report

primary endpoint (ARR) and disability accumulation are based on the evaluations of the EDSS and FS 
scores,  assessed  by  an  efficacy  assessor,  not  involved  in  any  other  aspects  of  patient  care  and 
management throughout the study. 
During the procedure, the applicant was requested to clarify whether the same physician performed the 
EDSS  evaluations  at  baseline  and  over 
the  study  as 
indicated 
in 
the  EMA  guideline 
EMA/CHMP/771815/2011. The applicant provided data showing that for more than 80% of subjects, the 
same EDSS assessor as at baseline conducted the EDSS assessments throughout the study. Additionally, 
the applicant performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the risk for a 12-week CDA event and 24-week 
CDA event derived only on EDSS scores from the same assessor as baseline showing similar results. The 
clarifications presented by the applicant were considered sufficient. 
Statistical methods 
Four main analysis sets were defined: 
•  Screened Analysis Set: all subjects who were screened and received a subject number. 
• 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomised subjects. 
The per-protocol (PPS) set: all subjects in the FAS not affected by major protocol deviations. 
The safety analysis set: all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.  
The primary estimand was defined by the following components: 
• 
Population: Subjects with RMS, as defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study. 
•  Variable: ARR (number of confirmed relapses per subject-year) up to EOS 
• 
Intercurrent events with corresponding strategies: 
o  Treatment discontinuation: Treatment Policy Strategy; including all confirmed relapses 
regardless of treatment discontinuation. 
o  Start  of  alternative  DMTs  for  MS:  Treatment  Policy  Strategy;  including  all  confirmed 
relapses, regardless of start of alternative DMTs.  
o  Study discontinuation: Hypothetical Strategy; effect if all subjects remained on study as 
planned per protocol.  
•  Summary Measure: Rate ratio of ponesimod versus teriflunomide. 
Main analysis method 
The primary analysis was performed up to EOS based on the FAS using an NB regression model for 
confirmed relapses, with treatment as a factor and the binary stratification variables (EDSS 3.5 versus 
EDSS >3.5; DMT within last 2 years prior to randomisation [Yes/No]) and the number of relapses in the 
year  prior  to  study  entry  (categories  ≤1  [or  missing,  in  order  to  avoid  excluding  subjects  from  the 
analysis] and ≥2) included in the model. The model also included an offset variable defined as the log 
of time on the study (in years) from randomisation up to EOS. The primary null hypothesis will be tested 
with a two-sided alpha level of 1% for conclusive evidence and 5% for a positive study. 
Mean model-based estimates of the ARR (for confirmed relapses), by treatment arm, as well as 99% CIs 
and 95% CIs are presented. A rate ratio comparing ponesimod 20 mg with teriflunomide 14 mg will be 
derived from the model including 99% CIs, 95% CIs and the corresponding p-value.

The effects of covariates on the primary analysis were tested using several sensitivity analyses: an 
unadjusted  analysis;  and  an  analysis  using  derived  stratification  variables.  Sensitivity  analysis  on  the 
missing  data  handling  consisted  of:  a  missing  at  random  (MAR)  multiple  imputation  (MI)  approach 
assuming similar rates before and after withdrawal; two reference-based MI approaches, copy reference 
using the teriflunomide rate after withdrawal but retaining the treatment effect up to withdrawal, and 
jump  to  reference  imputing  reference  rate  assuming  withdrawn  patients  will  quickly  lose  any  positive 
effect  up  to  withdrawal;  delta-adjustment  MI  assuming  different  penalties  for  the  ponesimod  and 
teriflunomide arms. 
The secondary endpoint analysis for fatigue will be based on the FAS. A mixed-effect model repeated 
measurements  (MMRM)  which  includes  baseline,  and  the  two  stratification  factors  as  covariates, 
treatment  (fixed  effects),  visit,  treatment  by  visit  interaction,  and  baseline  by  visit  interaction  are 
applied.  An unstructured  co-variance  structure  shared  across  treatment  groups  will  be  used  to  model 
within-patient  errors.  A  generalised  linear  model  with  NB  distribution  as  described  for  the  primary 
analysis will be assumed for the number of CUAL from baseline to Week 108. The main analysis on Time 
to 12-Week and 24-Week CDA up to EOS will be performed on the FAS by a two-sided stratified log-rank 
test with stratification factors as stratification variables and a stratified Cox regression will be provided. 
A multiple testing strategy was applied, which started with testing the primary endpoint at full alpha, 
followed hierarchically by a fall-back type procedure for the secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint 
null hypothesis was rejected, the alpha was to be split evenly (1/3 of alpha) between the first 3 of 4 
secondary endpoints, with subsequent reusing alpha after a successful test. 
For the primary and all secondary endpoints, the subgroup analyses were conducted using the FAS 
and/or  the  PPS  on  the  following  subgroup  variables:  baseline  EDSS;  DMT  within  last  2  years  prior  to 
randomisation; geographical region; gender; age group; MS subtype; Number of relapses in the year 
prior to study entry; Gd+ lesions at baseline; highly active disease; and recruitment period. A subject 
was considered to have highly active disease if one or both of the following conditions were fulfilled: 
1.  Any  DMT  for  MS  received  within  12  months  prior  to  randomisation  and  one  or  both  of  the 
following: 
o  ≥1 relapse within 1 year prior to study entry and the baseline  MRI read centrally showed 
either ≥1 Gd+ lesion and/or ≥9 T2 lesions 
o  Number of relapses within 1 year prior to study entry ≥ number of relapses between 2 and 
1 year prior to study entry, for subjects with at least one relapse within 2 years prior to study 
entry. 
2.  ≥2 relapses within the 1 year prior to study entry and baseline EDSS score >2 and baseline MRI 
read centrally showed ≥1 Gd+ lesion.

There were 6 substantial global amendments to the protocol: 
•  Amendment  1  (29  Apr  2015  (protocol  version  2))  included  a  clarification  was  included  that  MS 
relapses were not to be considered as AEs.  However, this is considered to have no impact on the 
study conduction as the first patient was screened on 27 April 2015 and the first randomisation date 
was 04 June 2015.  
•  Amendment 2 (16 Jul 2015 (protocol version 3) included a clarification on the exclusion criteria based 
on  PML  infection  suspect  as  well  as  changes  in  a  suicide  clinical  scale  and  frequency  of  WBC 
monitoring.  
•  Amendment  3  (05  Feb  2016  (protocol  version  4)  included  updates  in  response  to  the  comments 
received from the US FDA regarding the assessment of relapses including a standardised stepwise

procedure for the confirmation and reporting of relapses and a clarification concerning the role of 
the treating neurologist and efficacy assessor in EDSS and FS assessments.  
•  Amendment 4 (14 Nov 2016 (protocol version 5) included a change in the timing for teriflunomide 
plasma concentration testing triggered by the observation that 33.0% of all tests conducted showed 
teriflunomide plasma concentration above the threshold of 0.02 mg/L and thus risking the unblinding 
of the treatment allocation. At that time, the total number of affected subjects was very low (n=11).  
•  Amendment  5  (30  Aug  2017  (protocol  version  6)  allowed  testing  of  teriflunomide  plasma 
concentration in any subject who had discontinued study drug if deemed necessary for the subject’s 
safety, at the discretion of the investigator 
•  Amendment  6  (05  Dec  2018  (protocol  version  7))  revise  the  multiple  testing  strategy  for  the 
secondary endpoints:  (1) The number of secondary endpoints was reduced from five to four as time 
to first relapse and % change from baseline in BVL were moved from secondary to exploratory and 
time to 24-week CDA was moved from exploratory to secondary and (2) the multiple testing strategy 
to control the Type I error for testing secondary endpoints was modified according to a fallback type 
method to optimise the ability of the trial to achieve its objectives 
At least one protocol deviation (PD) was reported for all randomised subjects during the study. Important 
PDs were reported for 46.7% and 47.0% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide 14 mg 
groups, respectively. PDs related to efficacy and endpoints occurred in ~90% of patients and PDs related 
to blinding in 15% of patients. The distribution of important PDs across the two treatment groups was 
well-balanced except for efficacy/endpoint category reported with a higher frequency was reported for 
the teriflunomide 14 mg groups. According to the applicant, this imbalance can be explained by a higher 
occurrence  of  relapses  in  the  teriflunomide  14  mg  group.  Upon request,  the  applicant  has  provided  a 
thorough overview and impact assessment of PDs related to efficacy assessments and blinding, thereby 
addressing the study integrity. It is acknowledged that the overall complexity of the study with two data 
sets and numerous assessment points of several endpoints, and the policy on reporting PDs may have 
influenced the high number of reported PDs. The proportion of important PDs is similar to other recent 
MS  trials  which  is  reassuring.  The  performed  sensitivity  analyses  show  that  excluding  patients  with 
important  PDs  related  to  efficacy/endpoints  and  blinding  do  not  impact  the  overall  conclusions  of  the 
study. 
Mean compliance with study treatment in both treatment groups was 99% and less than 80% compliance 
with study treatment was reported for a total of 7 subjects (0.6%) and these were excluded from the 
PPS. 
Baseline data 
Overall,  the  study  population  was  predominantly  White  (97.4%)  and  64.9%  of  subjects  were  female. 
The median age was 37.0 years (range 18 to 55 years). The mean body mass index at baseline 24.7 
kg/m2. Most of the subjects were enrolled at centres in Europe, with 50.6% from EU countries + UK and 
41.7% from non-EU European countries plus Russia (Table 6). 
The study population predominantly included RRMS subjects (97.4%) with a mean (median) time since 
first MS symptoms to randomisation in the study of 7.64 (5.77) years. The mean baseline EDSS score 
was  2.6.  The  median  time  since  the  most  recent  relapse  at  screening  was  4.27  months  and  42.6% 
(39.9% on ponesimod 20 mg, 45.4% on teriflunomide 14 mg) of subjects had at least one Gd+ T1 lesion 
at  baseline.  The  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  received  any  DMTs  within  24  months  prior  to

randomisation  was  37.4%.  Approximately  35%  of  subjects  were  considered  to  have  a  highly  active 
disease at baseline (Table 7) (see definition of highly active disease in methods).

Rate  Ratio:  ponesimod  vs.  teriflunomide.  Delta(Pon)  =  multiplicative  delta  for  ponesimod;  Delta(Ter)  =  multiplicative  delta  for 
teriflunomide. 
Multiple imputation of count data based on Keene et al. 2014 is applied on the number of relapses between EOS and Week 108 for 
subjects with premature study discontinuation. 
Multiple imputed datasets are analysed with a NB model as for the main analysis.  
12-week CDA 
A 12-week CDA was observed in 10.1% and 12.4% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide 
14  mg  groups,  respectively.  The  risk  for  a  12-week  CDA  event  was  estimated  to  be  17%  lower  with 
ponesimod  20  mg  compared  to  teriflunomide  14  mg;  however,  the  difference  was  not  found  to  be 
statistically significant (Figure 9). Consequently, the formal testing procedure was stopped.

24-week CDA 
As 12-week CDA analysis did not demonstrate, a statistically significant difference between the treatment 
groups, 24-week CDA and all subsequent endpoints were handled as exploratory. A 24-week CDA was 
observed  in  8.1%  and  9.9%  of  subjects  in  the  ponesimod  20  mg  and  teriflunomide  14  mg  groups, 
respectively. The risk for a 24-week CDA event was estimated to be 16% lower for ponesimod 20 mg 
compared to teriflunomide 14 mg; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 10).

FSIQ-RMS 
The results on FSIQ-RMS based on the FAS using a MMRM show that the change from baseline to Week 
108 was  lower in the ponesimod 20 mg group compared with teriflunomide 14 mg (least square [LS] 
mean: −0.01 for ponesimod 20 mg and 3.56 for teriflunomide 14 mg, an increase from baseline indicates 
worsening in fatigue symptoms) (Table 10).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The primary endpoint of confirmed ARR up to EOS was analysed across different pre-defined subgroups 
(Figure  11).  Also  secondary  endpoints  FSIQ-RMS,  CUALs  and  12-week  CDA  were  assessed  across 
subgroups. The resulted are presented in Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14, respectively.

Comparison to placebo 
Additionally,  to  compare  ponesimod  20  mg  with  placebo  and  with  other  DMTs,  the  applicant  has 
conducted  pre-planned  analyses  using  data  from  study  B301  and  those  of  published  studies  of  other 
DMTs  for  MS.  These  include  a  Matching-Adjusted  Indirect  Comparison  (MAIC)  to  the  Teriflunomide 
Multiple  Sclerosis  Oral  (TEMSO)  study  comparing  teriflunomide  to  placebo  and  a  Model-Based  Meta-
Analysis (MBMA). The results of the MAIC analysis suggest that ponesimod 20 mg reduces the risk of 
12-week  sustained  disability  progression  by  40%  compared  to  placebo.  A  reduction  of  47%  in  ARR 
compared to placebo was observed. The results of the MDMA analysis suggest that in terms of disability 
progression and relapses, ponesimod positions in the middle of the DMTs included in the analysis.

Supportive studies 
Study B202 
Study  B202  is  an  ongoing,  prospective,  multicentre,  multinational,  randomised,  DB,  multiple-dose, 
uncontrolled, parallel-group extension study in subjects with RRMS who completed the B201 study. 
Subjects who had completed B201 to Week 24 were eligible to enrol into this extension B202 study. The 
extension study includes a transition period (Day −3 to −1, during which all subjects received their B201 
study  medication),  3  treatment  periods  (Treatment  Period  1  [TP1],  Treatment  Period  2  [TP2],  and 
Treatment  Period  3  [TP3]),  and  a  posttreatment  follow-up  period.  In  TP1,  all  ponesimod  doses  were 
administered, in TP2 10 mg and 20 mg, and in TP3 only the 20 mg dose. 
TP1 and TP2 have been completed, and TP3 is currently ongoing. Subjects and investigators remained 
blinded to study treatment assignment during the core (B201), TP1 and TP2. The main objective of B202 
was to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of ponesimod. The efficacy objectives were to 
investigate the long-term efficacy of ponesimod and to explore the dose-response relationship of 10, 20, 
and 40 mg ponesimod on disease control in subjects with RRMS. All objectives were exploratory, and no 
primary or secondary efficacy endpoints were defined. 
Analyses were performed  to examine the dose-response (pooled B201/TP1 for 10 mg, 20  mg and 40 
mg=AP1;  pooled  B201/TP1/TP2  for  10  mg  and  20  mg=AP2)  and  long-term  efficacy  (combined  core 
B201/TP1/TP2/TP3=AP3).  Dose-response  over  long-time  treatment  can  be  adequately  estimated  only 
for the analysis period AP1, i.e. up to week 96, before any dose switches occurred. 
Data is available up to data cut-off date of 31 March 2019. Of the 393 subjects who completed B201, a 
total of 353 subjects were enrolled into TP1 of B202. In the pooled B201/B202 analysis, the ponesimod

analysis  set  included  a  total  of  435  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  ponesimod  during  B201 
and/or B202. Of these 435 subjects; 139, 145, and 151 subjects were initially randomised to ponesimod 
10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg, respectively. 
As  of  the  cut-off  date  of  the  interim  analysis  (31  March  2019),  42.8%  of  subjects  in  the  PAS  had 
discontinued  study  treatment  at  any  time  during  either  B201  or  B202.  The  proportion  of  subjects 
discontinuing study treatment was higher in the 40 mg dose group (47.7%) when compared with the 10 
mg (41.0%) and 20 mg dose groups (39.3%). 
In terms of relapses and disability progression, a clear dose-response was observed, with 40 mg dose 
yielding the best results. As the examination of efficacy is exploratory, and there is no placebo control, 
no  firm  conclusions  on  efficacy  or  dose-response  in  the  long-term  can  be  made.  However,  based  on 
these results, the choice of 20 mg dose is supported, also taking into account the tolerability of the 40 
mg dose. 
Study B303 
Study  B301  was  followed  by  study  B303,  an  ongoing  prospective,  multicentre,  open-label,  non-
comparative,  long  term  extension  study,  which  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety, 
tolerability, and disease control with ponesimod 20 mg in subjects with RMS. 
The planned treatment period was 240 weeks. All efficacy analyses were exploratory and based on three 
analysis sets: combined (B301+B303), extension (subjects who received at least 1 dose of ponesimod 
20  mg  in  the  extension  study),  and  core  (core  analysis  period  for  the  877  subjects  who  entered  the 
extension study). 
Data is available up to data cut-off date of 31 March 2019. Of the subjects randomised in the core study, 
877 (77.4%) subjects (439 on ponesimod 20 mg and 438 on teriflunomide 14 mg) were enrolled in the 
extension study. 
A  total  of  6.4%  of  subjects  (5.5%  in  P20  mg/P20  mg  and  7.3%  in  T14  mg/P20  mg)  prematurely 
discontinued treatment during the extension study.  
Based on the open-label, explorative efficacy assessments, the ARR observed in the ponesimod group in 
the  pivotal  study  B301  remained  stable  during  the  extension  study  (0.22,  95%  CIs  0.19,  0.25  in  the 
combined analysis set). This also holds true for MRI based key endpoints.  
Further,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  for  12-week  and  24-week  CDA  remained  low:  10.8%  and  8.7%, 
respectively,  in  study  B301  and  14.5%  and  12.2%,  respectively,  in  study  B303.  This  may  reflect  the 
slow progression of disability in this patient population in general. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of ponesimod in the treatment of RMS was examined in one DB, active-controlled, randomised, 
parallel-group study B301. In this study, ponesimod 20 mg was administered once daily. Teriflunomide 
14 mg administered once daily was the comparator arm. 
A  supportive  dose-response  study  B201  examined  doses  of  10  mg,  20  mg  and  40  mg  vs  placebo.  In 
addition, long-term extension studies for both B201 and B301 are currently ongoing. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-response study B201

This  was  a  prospective,  multicentre,  randomised,  DB,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  dose-finding 
study, in which efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 3 doses of ponesimod (10, 20, or 40 mg) administered 
for 24 weeks were investigated in subjects with RRMS. The dose selection for this study was based on 
both  efficacy  and  safety  considerations,  based  on  data  from  Phase  1  single-ascending  and  multiple-
ascending  dose  studies.  A  30%  reduction  of  peripheral  lymphocyte  counts  which  was  considered 
minimum required reduction for selecting the 10 mg dose, may be considered rather small, considering 
that significant effects have been observed with much higher reductions. 
In this study, dose increments were performed in a weekly interval for patients randomised in the 20 
mg and 40 mg dose groups. The final up-titration regime selected for the Phase 3 study is different, with 
small increments up to 10 mg. The applicant performed a cross-over study to examine two up-titration 
regimes, which supported the choice of a slower up-titration regimen from safety perspective due to first 
dose effects of ponesimod, resulting in cardiac abnormalities, i.e. HR decrease and AV conduction delays.  
The  study  included  patients  aged  18  to  55  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  RRMS  according  to  the  revised 
(2005) McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS. Patients were required to have ≥1 documented relapse(s) 
within 12 months prior to screening or ≥2 documented relapses within 24 months prior to screening or 
at least 1 Gd+ lesion detected on T1-weighted MRI (central reading) at screening. EDSS score of 0 to 
5.5 (inclusive) at screening was required. Both treatment-naïve and patients previously treated with IFN 
beta-1a, IFN beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab, were eligible to enrol in the study. The study 
population consisted solely of RRMS patients; this is considered acceptable for a dose-response study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions per patient on T1-weighted 
MRI scans at Weeks 12 to 24. The MRI data from weeks 12 to 24 was selected for the calculation of the 
primary endpoint, due to expected delayed anti-inflammatory action previously seen in fingolimod data. 
This approach is accepted and was also followed in another recent SP1 modulator dossier. Secondary 
endpoints included ARR and time to first confirmed relapse. An MRI primary endpoint is accepted for a 
dose-response study.  
The primary statistical analysis was performed using a NB regression model with treatment group as 4 
level nominal covariate, which is acceptable. 
The applicant also performed E-R modelling based on the results of this study, which is discussed under 
PD section of this CHMP assessment report. 
The study methods are in overall considered acceptable.  
Pivotal study B301 
Study  B301  is  a  multicentre,  randomised,  DB,  parallel-group,  active-controlled,  superiority  study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of ponesimod to teriflunomide in subjects with RMS. The treatment 
period was 108 weeks. The study design as such follows a conventional RMS study for a DMT, with a 
treatment period of 108 weeks and an active comparator arm, without placebo control. 
The  applicant  thus  performed  a  single  pivotal  study.  This  has  been  discussed  in  a  CHMP  AS 
EMA/H/SA/2170/FU/1/2014/III,  EMA/H/SA/2170/4/FU/2/2019/II),  where  specific  advice  was  given  to 
the  applicant  concerning,  e.g.  the  level  of  significance  to  be  applied.  A  single  pivotal  study  will  be 
assessed in the context of EMA points to consider an application with 1. Meta-analyses; 2. One pivotal 
study  (CPMP/EWP/2330/99).  In  addition  to  statistical  significance,  important  aspects  to  be  taken  into 
consideration  in  the  assessment  of  a  single  pivotal  study  are  external  and  internal  validity,  clinical 
relevance, data quality and internal consistency. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered acceptable. Both, patients with RRMS and SPMS were 
included in the study, which has become standard in current MS studies in order to obtain at least some 
Assessment report

data in SPMS patients as well when RMS indication is sought. Nevertheless, it is considered that efficacy 
in terms of relapse rate seen in patients with RRMS can be extrapolated to patients with SPMS, in line 
with  the  EMA  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple 
Sclerosis  (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.  2).  Active  disease  was  confirmed  with  clinical  or  imaging 
features, which is acceptable. Treatment-naïve or patients previously treated with DMTs were included 
in the study, which is acceptable and in line with current treatment practises. 
The study included only the 20 mg QD dose of ponesimod. Based on the results of the dose-response 
study,  performed  PK/PD  modelling  exercises  and  safety  data,  this  is  accepted.  A  gradual  up-titration 
scheme was applied, which is acceptable, as stated earlier. 
Teriflunomide  is  accepted  as  active  control  for  this  study,  with  an  aim  to  show  superiority  to  an 
established DMT. Accelerated elimination procedure was applied in the study, due to the very long half-
life of teriflunomide. To maintain blinding, the elimination procedure was performed in both treatment 
arms, which is acceptable. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  whether  ponesimod  is  more  efficacious  than 
teriflunomide in terms of reducing relapses in subjects with RMS. Secondary objectives were to assess 
the effect of ponesimod on disability accumulation and on other aspects of MS disease control, and to 
assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ponesimod  in  subjects  with  RMS.  The  study  objectives  are 
acceptable; however, it is noted that the hierarchy of study endpoints does not follow the objectives: 
the  key  secondary  endpoint  defined  was  fatigue  as  measured  by  the  symptoms  domain  of  the  FSIQ–
RMS,  not  disability  progression.  Although  fatigue  is  considered  a  relevant  endpoint,  disability 
accumulation is considered more important for the assessment of efficacy. In accordance with the MS 
guideline, if ARR is the primary endpoint, disability should be the key secondary endpoint. The testing 
hierarchy 
was 
discussed 
during 
CHMP 
SA 
(EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/2011/III, 
EMA/H/SA/2170/FU/1/2014/III) 
even 
when 
the 
study 
was 
already 
ongoing 
(EMEA/H/SA/2170/1/FU/2/2018/II,  EMA/H/SA/2170/4/FU/2/2019/II).  The  applicant  wished  to  amend 
the hierarchy by placing disability progression lower in the testing hierarchy. The CHMP advice stressed 
the  importance  of  disability  progression  as  the  key  secondary  endpoint,  expressing  concerns  on  the 
chosen testing strategy. In the CHMP advice, it was also stated that the 24-week CDA is considered more 
important than the 12-week CDA; however, it was acknowledged that success in 24-week CDA would be 
less likely than in the 12-week CDA. The testing hierarchy, as defined in the MS guideline, is followed in 
this  review,  thus  presenting  disability  progression  data  after  the  primary  endpoint  ARR.  The  testing 
strategy was amended when the study was ongoing, and the applicant was invited to clarify the rationale 
behind this amendment. The applicant has clarified that the change in the order of the hierarchical testing 
strategy was performed in a blinded manner and based on results from external studies, to optimise the 
chance of success for the secondary endpoints. This is accepted.   
The primary endpoint was ARR up to EOS, defined as the number of confirmed relapses according to the 
treating  neurologist/principal  investigator  per  subject-year.  Relapse  definition  is  in  line  with  previous 
RMS studies and acceptable. The secondary efficacy variables were change from baseline to Week 108 
in  fatigue-related  symptoms  as  measured  by  the  symptoms  domain  of  the  FSIQ–RMS,  CUALs  from 
baseline to Week 108, time to 12-week CDA from baseline to EOS and time to 24-week CDA from baseline 
to EOS. As already mentioned, disability progression is considered a key secondary endpoint. 
The FSIQ-RMS is a PRO developed by the applicant. It is a 20-item PRO measure that was developed by 
Actelion to evaluate fatigue-related symptoms and the impacts of those symptoms on the lives of people 
with  RMS.  The  development  and  validation  of  the  FSIQ-RMS  seem  adequately  performed.  The 
psychometric  study  in  patients  with  RMS  and  controls  demonstrates  good  reliability  and  validity. 
Concurrent  validity  was  tested  against  other  PRO  instruments  Modified  Fatigue  Impact  Scale,  Patient 
Global Impression Severity (PGI-S) and RAND 36 Health Survey Version. Correlations were moderate to 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 89/136 
 
  
 
 
high in all comparisons. A correlation of EDSS score and FSIQ-RMS symptoms domain score was also 
shown. However, as the endpoint has not been included in a clinical study before, its sensitivity to change 
was not tested before applying the questionnaire in the Phase 3 study. Furthermore, a clinically relevant 
change was also unknown at the start of the study. These hamper the assessment of results on FSIQ-
RMS, as discussed in the results section. 
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions derived from TEMSO and TOWER studies, which in 
hindsight were applicable, and the calculation is accepted. 
The analysis sets, primary and secondary endpoint analysis and handling of multiplicity are considered 
standard  and  acceptable.  Note  that  the  primary  null  hypothesis  will  be  tested  with  a  two-sided  alpha 
level of 1% for conclusive evidence and 5% for a positive study, which is in line with the CHMP advice in 
the context of a single pivotal study.  
In  the  chosen  estimand  and  the  resulting  missing  data  handling,  study  discontinuation  is  seen  as  a 
random event, which may not be realistic. However, the applicant provided a sensitivity analysis using 
reference-based imputation with results similar to the primary analysis, showing the results are robust 
to the missing data assumption. 
Long-term study B202 
Study  B202  is  an  ongoing,  prospective,  multicentre,  multinational,  randomised,  DB,  multiple-dose, 
uncontrolled, parallel-group extension study in subjects with RRMS who completed the B201 study. The 
extension study includes a transition period (Day −3 to −1, during which all subjects received their B201 
study medication), 3 treatment periods (TP1, TP2,TP3), and a posttreatment follow-up period. In TP1, 
all ponesimod doses were administered; in TP2, 10 mg and 20 mg; and in TP3, only the 20 mg dose. 
TP1 and TP2 have been completed, and TP3 is currently ongoing. Subjects and investigators remained 
blinded to study treatment assignment during the core (B201), TP1 and TP2. Analyses were performed 
to  examine  the  dose-response  (pooled  B201/TP1  for  10  mg,  20  mg  and  40  mg=AP1;  pooled 
B201/TP1/TP2 
for  10  mg  and  20  mg=AP2)  and 
long-term  efficacy 
(combined  core 
B201/TP1/TP2/TP3=AP3).  Dose-response  over  long-time  treatment  can  be  adequately  estimated  only 
for the analysis period AP1, i.e. up to week 96 before any dose switches occurred. 
Long-term study B303 
Study  B301  was  followed  by  study  B303,  an  ongoing  prospective,  multicentre,  open-label,  non-
comparative,  long  term  extension  study,  which  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety, 
tolerability, and disease control with ponesimod 20 mg in subjects with RMS. 
The planned treatment period was 240 weeks. All efficacy analyses were exploratory and based on three 
analysis sets: combined (B301+B303), extension (subjects who received at least 1 dose of ponesimod 
20  mg  in  the  extension  study),  and  core  (core  analysis  period  for  the  877  subjects  who  entered  the 
extension study). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-response study B201 
A statistically significant difference vs. placebo was demonstrated in all three ponesimod groups in the 
primary endpoint. 40 mg dose does not seem to provide remarkable additional benefit on top of the 20 
mg dose in terms of MRI endpoints. The performed dose-response modelling also suggests that the effect 
of ponesimod plateaus after 20 mg. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 90/136 
 
  
 
 
However,  in  ARR,  40  mg  dose  was  the  only  ponesimod  dose  separating  from  placebo.  However,  the 
study was not powered to show a statistically significant effect on ARR, and the study duration is likely 
too short of providing a reliable estimation on ARR. Also, in terms of time to first relapse, the 40 mg 
dose performed best out of the three ponesimod dose groups. Therefore from an efficacy point of view, 
both  20  mg  and  40  mg  doses  could  have  been  selected  for  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study.  From  a  safety 
perspective, however, it is accepted that the 40 mg dose was omitted from the Phase 3 study. 
Pivotal study B301 
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  the  study  prematurely  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  the 
ponesimod group, more patients discontinued due to tolerability as compared to teriflunomide group. In 
contrast, more patients in the teriflunomide group discontinued due to lack of efficacy as compared to 
the ponesimod group. 
There were 6 substantial global amendments to the protocol. In amendment 3, a clarification was added 
concerning the role of the treating neurologist and efficacy assessor in EDSS and FS assessments. The 
applicant  has  clarified  that  this  clarification  was  included  as  per  request  of  FDA  review  of  the  AC-
058B302/POINT  study  protocol  and  was  not  triggered  by  observed  deviations  in  roles  of  the  treating 
neurologist and efficacy accessor during the study. Moreover, the maximum proportion of patients with 
a PD related to access to PUD before the clarification was added to the protocol was small i.e. <1%. 
All patients included in the study had a least one PD, which is striking. The PDs were balanced between 
the treatment groups, and as later can be seen, the PP analysis excluding patients with PDs occurring 
prior  to  or  at  randomisation  was  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  The  applicant  also  provided 
sensitivity  analyses  excluding  patients  with  important  PDs  related  to  efficacy  endpoints  and  blinding, 
which demonstrated consistent results with the primary analysis. The noted higher incidence of important 
PDs  in  the  efficacy/endpoint  group  is  associated  with  higher  relapses  rate  in  the  teriflunomide  group. 
The applicant has clarified that this was driven by an imbalance on relapse confirmation PDs. As there 
were more relapses in the teriflunomide group, the chance of relapse confirmation PDs was also higher. 
This is accepted. Altogether the applicant has provided a thorough overview and impact assessment of 
PDs related to efficacy assessments and blinding, thereby addressing the study integrity. The provided 
clarifications and additional analyses provide adequate assurance of the study integrity and validity of 
results, and therefore a GCP inspection is not considered required. 
The baseline demographic characteristics are usual to MS trials: the majority of patients are female and 
in mid-thirties. The vast majority of patients included were from study centres in Europe and Russia. The 
baseline demographic characteristics are balanced between the treatment groups. 
The baseline disease characteristics reflect a typical patient with RMS in need of DMT and are largely 
similar to patient populations included in recently assessed RMS dossiers. Almost half of the patients had 
previously  received  a  DMT.  Only  a  small  number  of  patients  (n=29)  with  SPMS  were  included.  
Approximately  35%  of  patients  were  considered  to  have  a  highly  active  disease  as  per  pre-defined 
criteria. The criteria for the highly active disease are in line with the criteria seen in recent RMS studies. 
There were some differences between the treatment groups in baseline MRI variables; however, these 
differences  were  not  reflected  in  the  other  baseline  disease  characteristics  and  are  therefore  not 
considered of concern. 
The mean ARR (number of confirmed relapses per year) was 0.202 and 0.290 in the ponesimod 20 mg 
and teriflunomide 14 mg groups. Ponesimod 20 mg statistically significantly reduced ARR up to EOS by 
30.5% compared to teriflunomide 14 mg (ARR ratio: 0.695; 99% CIs 0.536, 0.902; p=0.0003). Thus 
the  study  clearly  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  ponesimod  over  teriflunomide.  Sensitivity  analyses 
were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  However,  it  is  noted  that  the  sensitivity  analyses  using 
reference-based imputation of missing data, which could be more realistic than the MAR approach in the 
Assessment report

Page 91/136 
 
  
 
 
main analysis, show a smaller treatment effect. During the procedure, the applicant has been invited to 
discuss which missing data handling would provide the most realistic estimate of the effect and should 
be presented in the product information: the MAR in the main analysis, or the missing data not at random 
in  the  reference-based  analysis  provided  as  sensitivity  analyses.  The  ARR  before  discontinuation  was 
lower  for  ponesimod  patients  than  for  teriflunomide.  Likewise,  data  after  treatment  discontinuation 
indicated a lower ARR for previous ponesimod use than teriflunomide, so it can be agreed that reference-
based  imputation  may  not  be  the  most  realistic  method  of  handling  missing  data.  The  applicant 
performed a sensitivity analysis using retrieved dropout imputation, which would then be more realistic. 
This resulted in a rate ratio of 0.702 (99%CI: 0.538-0.916) which is close to the primary analysis result 
of 0.695 (0.536, 0.902). Since the results are close together, it is agreed to present the primary analysis 
assuming missing at random in the SmPC. 
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in disability progression; 
however, ponesimod was numerically favoured in both 12- and 24-week CDA. The risk for a 12-week 
CDA  event  was  estimated  to  be  17%  lower  with  ponesimod  20  mg  compared  to  teriflunomide  14  mg 
(HR: 0.83; 95% CIs: 0.58, 1.18; p=0.2939). The  risk for a 24-week CDA event was estimated to be 
16% lower for ponesimod 20 mg compared to teriflunomide 14 mg (HR: 0.84; 95% CIs: 0.57, 1.24; 
p=0.3720). These observations were confirmed in the supplementary and sensitivity analyses. 
The  FSIQ-RMS  weekly  symptoms  score  remained  stable  in  the  ponesimod  group  while  the  score 
increased in the teriflunomide group. As compared to baseline, thus, there was no improvement in the 
fatigue  scores  in  the  ponesimod  group.  Clinically  meaningful  change  in  the  FSIQ-RMS  was  not  pre-
specified in the study protocol. According to the psychometric analysis based on the data from this pivotal 
study, a clinically meaningful change at the subject level in the FSIQ-RMS was defined. This was done 
by anchoring the PGI-S score to the FSIQ-RMS score. A -6.3 change on the FSIQ-RMS was concluded as 
the meaningful change threshold value at the subject level. 
Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  fatigue  is  of  high  relevance  to  patients  with  MS  and  a  statistically 
significant  difference  to  teriflunomide  was  observed  in  favour  of  ponesimod,  no  clinically  relevant 
improvement  in  fatigue  was  demonstrated.  The  observed  mean  difference  in  change  in  FSIQ-RMS-S 
between  the  treatment  groups  is  -3.57  (95%  CI  -5.83.  -1.32),  less  than  -6.3  points,  which  was 
determined to be meaningful change threshold at the subject level. The mean change in the ponesimod 
group from baseline was -0.01. 
Based on a patient preference study, the applicant concludes that the observed change of -3.57 in the 
FSIQ-RMS-S score is equally important to patients as a change of -0.06 in yearly relapse rate, which 
matches the between-treatment difference in ARR observed in the pivotal study B301 i.e. -0.088. This 
is a somewhat difficult comparison as while the patient preference study measures absolute changes in 
the FSIQ-RMS and relapse rate, the comparison is to a between-treatment difference of ponesimod and 
teriflunomide. A fair comparison would be if the between-treatment comparison would be to placebo. 
To further support the clinical relevance of the observed difference in FSIQ-RMS-S between the treatment 
groups,  the  applicant  presented  cumulative  distribution  curves,  which  allows  examining  whether  the 
difference  in  responders  over  alternative  cut-off  point  than  the  meaningful  change  threshold  of  -6.3 
points is consistent. Based on the provided cumulative distribution curves, the difference between the 
study arms in subjects with an improvement on the fatigue score is marginal. There is worsening, and 
the difference between the study arms in the proportion of subjects worsening is around 5% irrespective 
of whether the cut-off point is +5, + 10 or +15 points. The question remains whether a 5% difference 
shift  in  the  cumulative  distribution  curve  is  of  clinical  relevance.  Moreover,  the  statistically  significant 
difference in the FSIQ-RMS-S is due to a worsening in the teriflunomide group and not to an improvement 
in the ponesimod group. In fact, the fatigue score in the ponesimod group remains stable. This appears 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 92/136 
 
  
 
 
logical i.e. the reduction in ARR implies that in the ponesimod group, less new events occur that leads 
to fatigue. So, the implicit claim that ponesimod has an independent effect on fatigue is not warranted. 
It is also noted that other FSIQ-RMS endpoints, i.e. FSIQ-R improvement and FSIQ-RMS impacts domain 
scores  did  not  show  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  Also,  in  PGI-S 
fatigue, the treatment groups did not differ.  
Furthermore, it is noted that the baseline FSIQ-RMS, as well as PGI-S scores, indicate that majority of 
patients had mild fatigue thus little room for improvement. 
As  the  difference  between  ponesimod  and  teriflunomide  in  FSIQ-RMS-S  is  not  considered  clinically 
relevant, the results on FSIQ-RMS-S are not presented in SmPC section 5.1, which should be reserved 
to results that are statistically compelling and clinically relevant. 
The mean CUALs per year were 1.405 for ponesimod 20 mg compared to 3.164 for teriflunomide 14 mg 
(RR: 0.444; 95% CIs: 0.364, 0.542; p<0.0001). The superiority of ponesimod over teriflunomide was 
thus clearly demonstrated in this secondary MRI endpoint. 
The changes in EDSS score overtime were minimal; nevertheless, the treatment groups separated from 
week 60 onwards, in favour of ponesimod. The LS mean difference (ponesimod 20 mg − teriflunomide 
14  mg)  in  change  from  baseline  to  Week  108  in  EDSS  score  was  −0.13  (95%  CIs:  −0.22,  −0.04; 
p=0.0059). 
The key clinical and MRI exploratory endpoints, all consistently show the superiority of ponesimod over 
teriflunomide. These include e.g. time to first confirmed relapse (p=0.0081), NEDA (NEDA-3, p=0.0004 
and NEDA-4, p=0.0026),  number of new Gd+ lesions (p<0.0001), number of new / enlarging T2 lesions 
(p<0.0001) and BVL (p<0.0001). The p values are nominal, as the formal testing procedure was stopped 
after 12-week CDA.  
Only very small changes were observed in the quality of life scores (SF-36) from baseline up to week 
108, and there were no notable differences between the treatment groups. 
The results of subgroup analyses suggest a rather consistent effect across subgroups. Subgroups with a 
small  number  of  patients,  e.g.  SPMS  and  geographical  regions  North  America  and  Rest  of  the  World, 
stand  out  with  wide  confidence  intervals.  It  is  also  notable  that  in  patients  with  baseline  EDSS  score 
>3.5, teriflunomide appears to perform better across all primary and secondary endpoints except CUALs. 
However  there  was  no  significant  interaction  (p=0.72)  between  treatment  and  baseline  EDSS  (EDSS 
≤3.5 and EDSS >3.5) and ARR, CDA and fatigue symptoms, and the efficacy on the CUAL endpoint was 
the same in EDSS ≤3.5 and pointing at the same biological activity. Therefore the observation is likely 
a chance finding. 
Results on relapses as seen in patients with RRMS can be extrapolated to patients with SPMS. Therefore, 
the RMS indication would in principle be acceptable.  
Long-term study B202 
Interim results up to data cut-off of 31 March 2019 are available. Of the 393 subjects who completed 
B201,  a  total  of  353  subjects  were  enrolled  into  TP1  of  B202.  Of  the  310  subjects  who  completed 
treatment in TP1, 305 subjects went on to enter TP2. Of the 231 subjects who completed treatment in 
TP2, a total of 228 subjects went on to enter TP3. 42.8% of subjects in the ponesimod analysis set had 
discontinued  study  treatment  at  any  time  during  either  B201  or  B202.  The  proportion  of  subjects 
discontinuing  study  treatment  was  higher  in  patients  initially  randomised  to  40  mg  (47.7%)  when 
compared with patients initially randomised to 10 mg (41.0%) and 20 mg (39.3%). 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 93/136 
 
  
 
 
In terms of relapses and disability progression, a clear dose-response was observed in AP1, with 40 mg 
dose yielding the best results.  As the examination of efficacy is exploratory, and there is no placebo 
control, no firm conclusions on efficacy or dose-response in the long-term can be made. However, based 
on these results, the choice of 20 mg dose is supported, also taking into account the tolerability of the 
40 mg dose. 
Long-term study B303 
Interim results up to data cut-off of 31 March 2019 are available. Of the subjects randomised in the core 
study, 877 (77.4%) subjects (439 on ponesimod 20 mg and 438 on teriflunomide 14 mg) were enrolled 
in the extension study. A total of 6.4% of subjects (5.5% in P20 mg/P20 mg and 7.3% in T14 mg/P20 
mg) prematurely discontinued treatment during the extension study.  
Based on the open-label, explorative efficacy assessments, the ARR observed in the ponesimod group in 
the  pivotal  study  B301  remained  stable  during  the  extension  study  (0.22,  95%  CI  0.19,  0.25  in  the 
combined analysis set). This also holds true for MRI based key endpoints.  
Further,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  for  12-week  and  24-week  CDA  remained  low:  10.8%  and  8.7%, 
respectively,  in  study  B301  and  14.5%  and  12.2%,  respectively,  in  study  B303.  This  may  reflect  the 
slow progression of disability in this patient population in general. 
Additional analyses 
Additionally, to compare ponesimod 20 mg with placebo and with DMTs, the sponsor has conducted pre-
planned analyses using data from study B301 and those of published studies of other DMTs for MS. These 
include a MAIC to the TEMSO study comparing teriflunomide to placebo and a MBMA.  
No firm conclusion on ponesimod performance against placebo or its position in the array of DMTs can 
be  made  due  to  common  drawbacks  of  indirect  comparisons.  However,  this  is  not  of  concern  as  the 
pivotal study performed according to state-of-art has demonstrated superiority to an approved DMT.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of ponesimod in the treatment of RMS was examined in one pivotal study, supported by a dose-
response study and the long-term extension studies of both of these studies. The design of the studies 
follows conventional MS studies. The clinical programme is considered adequate, and the requirements 
for  a  single  pivotal  trial  are  met.  Study  integrity  has  been  confirmed  and  a  GCP  inspection  is  not 
considered required. 
Ponesimod 20 mg demonstrated clear superiority to teriflunomide in relapses in the pivotal study, with 
a p-value of <0.0003 with 1% two-sided alpha. This was supported across  key MRI endpoints. There 
was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  in  disability  progression.  The 
applicant  opted  to  apply  the  fatigue  score  FSIQ-RMS  as  the  key  secondary  endpoint;  however,  no 
clinically relevant changes in this endpoint were observed, which would support presenting the results 
in  the  SmPC.  Other  relevant  clinical  endpoints,  such  as  NEDA  also  demonstrated  the  superiority  of 
ponesimod over teriflunomide. 
A  limited  number  of  patients  with  SPMS  was  included.  However,  as  efficacy  in  relapses  can  be 
extrapolated from RRMS to SPMS, the indication RMS would in principle be acceptable.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As  of  the  cut-off  dates  March  2019,  2205  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  ponesimod,  including  1438 
subjects  exposed  to  ponesimod  monotherapy  in  the  MS  clinical  programme,  with  long-term  safety 
information of up to 9 years of continuous treatment available (more than 8 years for more than 200 MS 
subjects). 
Studies in support of RMS consist of 16 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies (B201, B202) and 1 phase 3 
study  (B301).  The  extension  studies  are  ongoing  at  the  time  of  filing,  and  interim  analyses  were 
performed including all data up to and including the cut-off dates (31 March 2019 for AC-058B202 and 
30 May 2019 for AC-058B303).  
Safety data from Phase 2 and 3 studies in MS patients were pooled in 3 different analysis periods (Table 
15 and Figure 15) to: 
• 
• 
• 
compare the short-term safety of 3 ponesimod doses (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) with placebo 
and teriflunomide (6-month pool). 
compare the medium-term safety of 3 ponesimod doses versus teriflunomide (2-year pool). 
characterise the long-term safety of ponesimod (long-term pool). 
The applicant provided not only the pooled analysis as indicated above, but for each safety topic, the 
following results were also presented: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the long-term pool analysis (focusing on the 20 mg dose) to show the safety profile of ponesimod 
with the longest treatment duration and highest exposure and to assess whether safety events 
were  reversible  based  on  follow-up  data  collected  upon  treatment  discontinuation  without 
interference from treatment/dose switching; 
the pivotal Phase 3 study (B301) for comparison between ponesimod at the label recommended 
maintenance dose (20 mg) with the active comparator teriflunomide (14 mg); 
the Phase 2 study (B201) for a 6-month dose comparison between ponesimod treatment with 
placebo and dose-response assessment; 
AP1  of  Studies  B201/B202  (median  exposure  of  2  years)  for  dose-response  assessment  (ie, 
before ponesimod dose switching occurred). 
In  the  long-term  pool,  the  majority  of  ponesimod-treated  subjects  were  white  (97.2%),  female 
(65.9%), and <40 years of age (58.1%). The mean age was 37.4 years (range: 18–58 years). Most of 
the subjects were enrolled at centres in EU + UK + Switzerland (52.3%), followed by Europe Non-EU + 
Russia (36.4%), North America (9.0%), and the rest of the world (2.3%). 
The  demographic  characteristics  of  ponesimod-treated  subjects  in  the  6-month  pool  and  2-year  pool 
were similar to those in the long-term pool.

In  Study  B201,  the  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  was  similar  between  ponesimod-treated  (17  of  341, 
5.0%) subjects and placebo-treated subjects (4.1%). Most SAEs were reported in individual subjects, 
except macular oedema, which was reported in 2 subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group, and AV block 
second degree, which was reported in 3 subjects on Day 1 after taking the first dose of ponesimod (10 
mg). 
Studies B201/B202 during AP1, 14 (10.1%) subjects in the 10 mg dose group, 15 (10.3%) subjects 
in the 20 mg dose group, and 7 (4.6%) subjects in the 40 mg dose group had at least one serious TEAE, 
corresponding  to  an  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  7.1,  6.8,  and  3.9  per  100  subject  years, 
respectively. Most SAE PTs were reported in individual subjects, and no clear dose-related trends were 
observed in the reporting of individual subjects. By SOC, there were more subjects in the 40 mg dose 
group  who  had  an  SAE  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  infestations  (5  [3.3%]  subjects,  compared  to  0

subjects in the 10 mg dose group and 2 [1.4%] subjects in the 20 mg dose group). Drug-related SAEs 
(i.e., SAEs that were judged by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to 
the use of the study drug) were observed in 8 (5.8%), 6 (4.1%), and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the 10 mg, 
20 mg, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. 
In study B301, the most commonly reported SAEs in both treatment groups were in the SOCs of Nervous 
system  disorders  (1.6%  ponesimod  20  mg  versus  1.1%  teriflunomide  14  mg)  and  Infections  and 
infestations (1.2% ponesimod 20 mg versus 0.7% teriflunomide 14 mg). Serious AEs occurring in >2 
subjects were appendicitis (n=3 (0.5%) in ponesimod 20 mg  group versus 0 in teriflunomide group), 
abdominal pain (n=3 (0.5%) in 20 mg ponesimod group vs 0 in teriflunomide group) and cholelithiasis 
(n=3 (0.5%) in teriflunomide 14 mg group vs 0 in ponesimod 20 mg group). 
In the AC-058B303 extension study, 24 new cases of SAEs were reported in the updated safety report 
with cut-off date March 2020. Seventeen resolved without sequelae, 3 solved with sequela and 4 are not 
resolved/currently  ongoing.  These  include  invasive  breast  carcinoma,  ligament  sprain,  epilepsy  and 
chronic bronchitis. 
An additional 7 new cases of serious adverse events were reported in 6 subjects in the safety database. 
These  concerned  diverticulitis,  mitral  valve  prolapse  and  duodenal  ulcer  haemorrhage,  hypertensive 
crisis,  headache,  ligament  sprain,  metrorrhagia,  pheochromocytoma.  All  but  mitral  valve  prolapse 
resolved without sequelae. 
Deaths 
A total of 3 deaths have been reported in Phase 2 and 3 MS studies, 1 in the ponesimod 20 mg group 
and 2 in the teriflunomide 14 mg group. Two additional deaths were reported in non-MS studies (Studies 
112 and A201). None of the AEs leading to death in any of the studies was assessed by the investigator 
as related to study treatment. No new deaths were reported in the updated safety report with the cut-
off date March 2020.  
Safety of special interest 
Immunological effect 
In  the  long-term  pool  ponesimod  treatment  resulted  in  a  rapid  decrease  in  the  estimated  mean 
lymphocyte  count  (based  on  a  MMRM  analysis)  from  baseline  (absolute  value=1.87×109,  n=1146)  to 
Week 4 (reduced by 59.12% in ponesimod 20 mg group to 0.75×109, n=1103), which stayed relatively 
stable through Week 468 (reduced by 52.79% to 0.84×109, n=45)  
For  subjects  in  the  ponesimod  20  mg  group,  the  absolute  mean  lymphocyte  count  was  1.849×109/L 
(n=1146), 0.735×109/L (n=1135), 1.488×109/L (n=75), and 1.722×109/L (n=99) at baseline, the last 
on-treatment,  FU  (follow-up)  Day  7,  and  FU  Day  15,  respectively,  indicating  a  rapid  reversal  of 
lymphocyte count upon treatment discontinuation. 
In  Study  B301,  the  rapid  decrease  in  lymphocyte  count  from  baseline  to  Week  2  and  Week  4  in  the 
ponesimod  20  mg  group  (mean  %  change  from  baseline  of  -42.34%  and  -59.15%,  respectively) 
compared to the teriflunomide 14 mg group (-5.21% and -8.45%, respectively) is also shown in Figure 
16 From Week 12 to Week 108, mean lymphocyte count in the ponesimod 20 mg group remained stable 
(Figure 16). The mean % decrease from baseline in lymphocyte count at last on-treatment timepoint 
was -61.17% in the ponesimod 20 mg group, compared to -12.49% in the teriflunomide 14 mg group.  
Upon  discontinuation  of  ponesimod  treatment,  the  %  of  subjects  with  lymphocyte  counts  above 
0.8x109/L was 37.9% (11/29), 84.6% (11/13) and 98.5% (202/205) in study B301, by FU Day 2, FU 
Assessment report

day 5 and FU day 15, respectively. Similar results were seen in study B301, with a lymphocyte counts 
above 0.8x109/L for 98.8% by FU Day 15 (n=484, both B201 and B301).  
The mean % decrease from baseline in lymphocyte count was -7.38% at FU Day 15 and -4.39% at FU 
Day 30. These results indicated that the decrease in lymphocyte count was reversible.

B301 Safety Set 
BL: Baseline (last value prior first study drug intake), LOT: Last on treatment, D15 FU: Day-15 Follow-up, D30 FU: Day-30 Follow-
up. 
Only central laboratory results were included. Except for baseline and follow-up, only treatment-emergent results were included. 
Infection 
Ponesimod reduces the number of circulating lymphocytes, which may increase the risk of infections. 
The overall rate of infections was comparable between subjects receiving ponesimod 20 mg and those 
receiving teriflunomide 14 mg (54.2% vs 52.1%, respectively).  
The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis  (17.4%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(9.8%),  and  urinary  tract  infection  (5.8%).  No  cases  of  PML,  cryptococcal  meningitis,  or  any  other 
opportunistic infections with fatal outcome were reported in any ponesimod dose group. 
Serious or severe AEs in the SOC of Infections and infestations are identified as infection AESIs. A total 
of 42 (out of 1438) ponesimod-treated subjects (25 [2.2%] in the ponesimod 20 mg group) reported an 
infection AESI (Table 21). TEAEs by PT reported in more than 1 subject in the ponesimod 20 mg group 
included  appendicitis  (6  subjects,  0.5%,  all  serious),  urinary  tract  infection  (2  subjects,  0.2%,  both 
serious), and pneumonia (2 subjects, 0.2%, 1 serious). 
No case of fatal infections has been reported in ponesimod-treated subjects. In the ponesimod 20 mg 
group, 0.2% subjects had infection AESIs that led to treatment discontinuation, and 1.8% subjects had 
serious infection AESIs. 
Among the 25 (2.2%) subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group who had infection AESIs, 31 events were 
reported, indicating that only a few subjects had recurrent events. The event rate per 100 subject-years 
was 0.6, 1.2, and 2.3 in the ponesimod 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg groups, respectively, suggesting dose-
dependency of the incidence of infection AESIs.

Herpetic Infection 
The incidence of herpetic infection TEAEs (including oral herpes) in ponesimod 20 mg-treated subjects 
was not dose-dependent, and not higher than either placebo- or teriflunomide 14 mg-treated subjects. 
In the long-term pool, 4.4% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group had a herpetic infection AESI. 
The most commonly (>1% subject) reported PTs in the ponesimod 20 mg group were oral herpes (2.4%) 
and herpes zoster (1.7%). Ophthalmic herpes zoster was reported in 1 subject. 
Skin Malignancy 
In the long-term pool, 0.6% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group had a skin malignancy AESI. The 
only  PTs  that  were  reported  in  more  than  1  subject  in  the  ponesimod  20 mg  group  were  basal  cell 
carcinoma (4 subjects, 0.3%) and skin neoplasm excision (2 subjects, 0.2%).

Basal cell carcinoma was reported in 7 subjects 1.9 to 8.0 years after initiation of ponesimod treatment 
in  MS  studies.  Two  subjects  on  ponesimod  20  mg  underwent  removal  of  dysplastic  naevus.  While 
dysplastic naevus is not a PT of skin malignancy AESI, the reported term "dysplastic naevus excision" 
was coded to "skin neoplasm excision", and thus counted as a skin malignancy AESI. 
Malignant melanoma was reported 1.9 years after initiation of ponesimod treatment in a subject with a 
medical history of benign and malignant skin lesions. The event rate per 100 subject years is 0.348 in 
the ponesimod 20 mg group. 
Non-skin malignancy 
In  the  long-term  pool,  10  (0.7%)  of  1438  subjects  in  the  total  ponesimod  group  (including  5  in  the 
ponesimod 20 mg group) had a non-skin malignancy AESI. The only PT that was reported in more than 
1 subject in the ponesimod 20 mg group was invasive ductal breast carcinoma (3 subjects, 0.3%).  
Breast cancer was reported in 6 female subjects (ages ranging 40-60 years) 3 years (median) (range 4 
months – 8.3 years) after initiation of ponesimod 10mg (3 cases), 20mg (2 cases) or 40mg (1 case).   
Cervical  carcinoma  was  reported  in  2  subjects  (one  case  of  adenocarcinoma  and  another  case  of 
squamous cell carcinoma in two females in their 40’s treated with ponesimod 10mg and 20mg for 1-4 
years.  
B-Cell lymphoma was reported in 1 subject (age ranging 55-65) positive for Epstein-Barr virus prior to 
study entry and treated with ponesimod over 2-3 years.  
One event of esophageal adenocarcinoma was reported in MS Studies. 
Five  (0.4%)  subjects  in  the  ponesimod  20  mg  group  had  a  serious  non-skin  malignancy  AESI.  Three 
(0.3%) subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group had a non-skin malignancy AESIs that led to treatment 
discontinuation. The event rate per 100 subject years is 0.19 in the ponesimod 20 mg group. 
Cardiovascular effects 
First dose effect 
Treatment-emergent AEs observed on the first day of ponesimod dosing in a total of 74 (17.0%) subjects. 
The most common TEAEs by PT were dizziness (n=22 (5.1%), headache (n=15 (3.4%), fatigue (n=10 
(2.3%), bradycardia (n=8 (1.8%), vertigo (n=6 (1.4), nausea (n=5 (1.1%), and first degree AV block 
(n=5 (1.1%). All other PTs reported on Day 1 were observed in <1% of subjects. 
Most TEAEs in this AESI category were mild or moderate and occurred on a single occasion. There were 
8  subjects  who  had  a  TEAE  in  this  AESI  category  that  was  recorded  as  serious  and/or  led  to 
discontinuation of study treatment. All these events occurred on Day 1 and resolved without sequelae 
following  discontinuation  of  ponesimod  treatment  (with  the  exception  first  degree  AV  block  in  one 
subject, which was unresolved). 
Events of syncope/presyncope were reported by 6 subjects, none of them occurred on Day 1. Overall, 
syncopic events were not associated with ponesimod treatment initiation or reinitiation 
Serious TEAEs  
Serious  adverse  events  occurring  on  the  first  day  of  dosing  (Day  1,  ie,  following  the  first  dose  of 
ponesimod  [10  mg])  were  reported  in  5  (1.1%)  subjects.  Of  the  5  SAEs  reported  on  Day  1,  4  led  to 
premature discontinuation: 3 subjects due to an SAE of second-degree AV block and 1 subject due to an 
SAE of ECG QT prolongation, somnolence, and vertigo. The fifth SAE reported in 1 subject on Day 1, 
pyrexia, did not lead to discontinuation. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 105/136 
 
  
 
 
Discontinuation due to TEAEs 
Ten (2.3%) subjects reported a TEAE on Day 1 (ie, following the first dose of ponesimod on Day 1 [10 
mg]) leading to study discontinuation. 
Nine of these subjects were discontinued due to TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC and 1 subject was 
discontinued due to TEAEs of ECG QT prolongation, somnolence, and vertigo. 
In Study B301, initiation of ponesimod using the gradual up-titration regimen (starting with ponesimod 
2  mg),  was  not  associated  with  clinically  significant  bradyarrhythmia  events;  none  of  the  reported 
bradyarrhythmia  events  was  serious  or  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment,  no  second  degree  or 
higher AV blocks were reported. 
Blood pressure 
In  the  long-term  pool,  mean  increases  of  <5  mmHg  from  baseline  in  SBP/DBP  were  observed  during 
treatment with ponesimod 20 mg. 
In the ponesimod 20 mg group, the estimated mean absolute change from baseline in DBP to the last 
available on-treatment DBP value (up to EOT+1 day) based on MMRM analysis in subjects with at least 
1 follow-up visit was 2.68 mmHg (n=188), and it returned to 1.57 mmHg (n=148) at FU Day 30. The 
estimated mean absolute change from baseline in SBP to the last available on treatment value (up to 
EOT+1 day) was 3.45 mmHg (n=188), and it returned to 0.81 mmHg (n=148) at FU Day 30, which was 
close to baseline level, indicating reversibility of BP increase upon ponesimod treatment discontinuation. 
In the long-term pool, treatment-emergent increases of ≥20 mmHg from baseline in SBP were reported 
for 25.3% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group. Treatment-emergent increases of ≥15 mmHg from 
baseline in DBP were reported for 25.7% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group. 
QT-events 
The  effect  on  the  QT  interval  was  examined  in  animal  studies  (anaesthetised  dogs)  and  the  phase  1 
study 110.  
Treatment with multiple-dose ponesimod at 40 mg and 100 mg (2 and 5 fold higher than the proposed 
maintenance dose) at steady state in healthy subjects resulted in mild prolongation of QTcI with a mean 
peak effect on ∆∆QTcI of 6.9 ms (upper bound of 90% 2-sided CI: 11.3 ms) with 40 mg ponesimod, and 
9.1 ms (upper bound of 90% CIs: 14.0 ms) with 100 mg ponesimod. Graphical exploration of the data 
indicated a lack of delayed effects. There was no consistent signal of increased incidence of QTcI outliers 
associated  with  ponesimod  treatment,  either  as  absolute  values  (QTcI  >480  ms)  or  change  (QTcI 
increase  >60  ms)  from  baseline.  All  incidences  of  QT  prolongation  reported  during  the  study  were 
considered to be not clinically significant 
In  the  long-term  pool,  no  TEAEs  of  torsade  de  pointes,  ventricular  tachycardia,  or  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia were reported. 
Echocardiograph 
Echocardiograph (ECHO) was performed during Studies B201/B202 at centres with adequate expertise. 
This assessment was only performed for a subset of subjects: a total of 79 subjects (26, 24, 29, subjects 
in the ponesimod 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg groups, respectively) were included in the ECHO analysis 
set. 
A total of 5 (19.2%), 12 (50.0%), and 11 (37.9%) subjects in the 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg dose groups 
(ECHO analysis set) had at least 1 treatment-emergent abnormal ECHO finding duringAP1. The majority 
of these findings were related to cardiac valves regurgitation findings, which largely consisted of trace 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 106/136 
 
  
 
 
mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonic valve regurgitation findings.  Mild regurgitation findings were 
observed  at  low  incidences  in  all  dose  groups.  No  moderate  or  severe  regurgitation  findings  were 
observed.  
Expert opinion following a review of ECHO data in Studies B201/B202 was that ponesimod did not result 
in  clinically  significant  changes  in  cardiac  structure  or  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction.  Likewise,  the 
changes in valvular structure and the trace/mild regurgitation observed in the aortic, mitral, pulmonic, 
and tricuspid valves are not clinically significant. 
Hepatic effects 
ALT: In the long-term pool, a mean increase from baseline was observed. Mean changes from baseline 
ranged  from  -2.5  to  33.7  U/L  (ponesimod  20 mg  group).  The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  last  on-
treatment assessment was 11.4 U/L in the ponesimod 20 mg group, and mean change from baseline to 
last FU assessment was 6.0 U/L, indicating reversibility of the ALT increase upon ponesimod treatment 
discontinuation. 
AST (aspartate aminotransferase): In the long-term pool, a mean increase from baseline was observed. 
Mean changes from baseline ranged from -0.2 to 17.7 U/L (ponesimod 20 mg group). The mean change 
from baseline to last on-treatment assessment was 5.8 U/L in the ponesimod 20 mg group, and mean 
change  from  baseline  to  last  FU  assessment  was  2.9  U/L,  indicating  reversibility  of  the  AST  increase 
upon ponesimod treatment discontinuation. 
Alkaline phosphatase: In the long-term pool, a mean increase from baseline was observed. Mean changes 
from baseline ranged from -3.5 to 15.4 U/L (ponesimod 20 mg group). 
Total bilirubin: In the long-term pool, mean changes from baseline ranged from -0.09 to 1.24 µmol/L 
and were unremarkable in ponesimod 20 mg group. 
Effect on Pulmonary function 
In the long-term pool, treatment with ponesimod 40 mg was associated with a higher risk of 
pulmonary AESIs as shown by the early and wide separation between the 40 mg Kaplan-Meier curve 
and the 10 mg and 20 mg Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 17).

Figure 17: Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Time to First Treatment-emergent AESIs by Grouping 
Term: Pulmonary Events; Analysis set: Long-term Pool Analysis Set [168 weeks] 
Subjects are summarised under their first randomised/allocated ponesimod dose group. 
Weeks where any one arm has < 10% of subjects at risk are not displayed. 
Bars show 95% CI (CI=Confidence Interval). Greenwood's formula is used for CI of Kaplan-Meier estimates; CIs are point-wise 
intervals. 
The proportion of subjects with at least one pulmonary AESI was 22.3%, 9.8% and 42.4%, for ponesimod 
10mg, 20mg and 40mg, respectively (Table 22). The event rate per 100 subject-years was 7.035, 5.682, 
and 15.077 in the ponesimod 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg groups, respectively, indicating that the effect 
of  ponesimod  on  pulmonary  function  was  similar  at  ponesimod  10  mg  and  20  mg  dose  levels,  but 
markedly worse at the 40 mg dose level. 
The PTs that were reported in more than one subject were dyspnea, obstructive airways disorder, forced 
expiratory  volume  decreased,  asthma,  pulmonary  function  tests  (PFT)  decreased,  dyspnoea  at  rest, 
forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased, dyspnoea exertional, bronchial obstruction, and bronchospasm in 
the ponesimod 20 mg group (Table 22).

The  changes  in  FEV1  and  diffusion  lung  capacity  for  carbon  monoxide  (DLCO)  appear  to  be  partially 
reversible after treatment discontinuation.  
Bronchodilator  assessment  was  introduced  to  test  the  reversibility  in  case  of  decrease  in  PFT. 
Administration  of  a  bronchodilator  (salbutamol/albuterol)  led  to  an  increase  in  the  mean  percentage 
predicted FEV1, suggesting that bronchodilators are able to rapidly reduce the effects of ponesimod on 
PFT variables. 
Seven (1.2%) subjects discontinued ponesimod because of pulmonary AEs, and 0.2% of subjects had 
serious  pulmonary  AESIs.  In  the  updated  safety  report  an  additional  3  subjects  discontinued  due  to 
obstructive airway disorder, dyspnea and decrease in FVC values of 29% less than from core baseline.  
Macular Oedema 
An independent Ophthalmology Safety Board (OSB) reviews in a blinded fashion any reports of macular 
oedema in the ponesimod clinical development programme. 
A total of 20 (out of 1438) ponesimod-treated subjects in MS programme reported a suspected macular 
oedema AESI based on PT search criteria pre-defined in OSB charter. 
Fourteen  subjects  reported  the  PT  of  macular  oedema,  4  subjects  reported  papilledema,  1  subject 
reported cystoid macular oedema, and 1 subject reported macular hole.  
The  OSB  confirmed  diagnosis  of  macular  oedema  in  12  subjects  (11  subjects  with  the  PT  of  macular 
oedema and 1 subject with the PT of cystoid macular oedema).  
Among  the  12  subjects  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  macular  oedema,  10  had  a  medical  history  or 
concomitant eye disorder including uveitis, retinal break, vitreous detachment, diabetes mellitus, diabetic 
retinopathy,  retrobulbar  optic  neuritis,  cataract  surgery,  optic  nerve  atrophy,  retinal  angiopathy, 
epiretinal fibrous proliferation, altered vitreoretinal interface, and MS-associated macular oedema. 
Confirmed  events  of  macular  oedema  in  all  12  subjects  resolved  (with  or  without  sequelae).  In  3 
subjects, macular oedema was reported as resolved with sequelae (not specified). According to the 
OSB evaluation, there was a complete resolution of oedema in 2 subjects. 
Neurological effects (including convulsion) 
Based on observations with other S1P receptor modulators and the known MS comorbidities, seizure was 
included as an AESI. 
In the long-term pool, a total of 16 (out of 1438) ponesimod-treated subjects reported a seizure AESI. 
Half of the cases were reported during the first 48 weeks of treatment. 
One percent (1.0%) of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group had a seizure AESI. The PTs that were 
reported in more than 1 subject were epilepsy and partial seizures with secondary generalisation (3 
subjects, 0.3%), and seizure (2 subjects, 0.2%) in the ponesimod 20 mg group. In the ponesimod 20 
mg group, 3 subjects (0.3%) had serious seizure AESIs and 1 subject had a seizure AESI that led to 
treatment discontinuation.

The event rate per 100 subject years is 0.696 in the ponesimod 20 mg group. 
In the long-term pool, no TEAEs of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) or reversible 
cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
In the long-term pool, changes from baseline in mean levels of clinical chemistry tests (other than liver 
tests) were observed in the ponesimod 20 mg group, which are not considered clinically important. 
In  Study  B301,  mean  changes  from  baseline  up  to  Week  108  for  creatinine,  creatinine  clearance, 
albumin,  glucose,  potassium,  and  sodium  were  small  and  similar  for  the  ponesimod  20 mg  and 
teriflunomide 14 mg groups. 
Mean changes from baseline by visit up to Week 108 in triglycerides ranged from 0.145 to 0.262 mmol/L 
in the ponesimod 20 mg group compared to -0.127 to 0.015 mmol/L in the teriflunomide 14 mg group. 
For cholesterol, mean changes from baseline by visit up to Week 108 ranged from 0.093 to 0.382 mmol/L 
in the ponesimod 20 mg group compared to -0.186 to -0.004 mmol/L in the teriflunomide 14 mg group. 
Treatment-emergent increases from baseline to >7.75 mmol/L in cholesterol were reported for 8.0% of 
subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group compared to 3.5% in the teriflunomide 14 mg group. 
A  total  of  10.1%  and  8.8%  of  subjects  in  the  ponesimod  20 mg  and  teriflunomide  14 mg  groups, 
respectively, had elevated potassium levels >5.5 mmol/L. 
Similar effects on triglycerides and cholesterol were observed in Study B201. 
The  applicant  performed  several  haematological  tests  examining  the  changes  in  blood  differential 
parameters. In the long-term pool, the proportions of subjects with markedly abnormal low haematology  
leukocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, haematocrit) values was <2.0% except for 
lymphocytes. These were not clinically meaningful changes. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific safety related differences were observed based on sex, race or geographical region.  
Limitation for the safety assessment in special populations is a very small number of enrolled patients 
older than 55 years and no patients older than 58 years.  
Ponesimod  has  not  been  studied  in  pregnant  and/or  breastfeeding  women.  Nonclinical  studies  in 
pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated ponesimod-induced developmental toxicity, including increased 
number of foetal malformations and embryolethality. Reproductive toxicity has been acknowledged also 
for other S1P receptor modulators.  
The current MAA does not include paediatric patients. However, PIP for children from 10 years of age 
has been approved in April 2018.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ponesimod  metabolism  is  mediated  by  multiple,  independent  P450,  non-P450  Phase  I,  and  Phase  II 
metabolic reactions 
In  vitro  studies  suggest  that  ponesimod  and  the  metabolite  M13  are  unlikely  to  cause  DDI  at 
concentrations  associated  with  therapeutic  dosing  of  20  mg  ponesimod  via  inhibition  or  induction  of 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, or inhibition of transporters. 
Ponesimod  did  not  affect  the  PK  of  ethinyl  estradiol  and  norethisterone  (Ortho-Novum®).  Therefore, 
concomitant use of ponesimod is not expected to decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. No 
interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  oral  contraceptives  containing  other  progestogens; 
however, an effect of ponesimod on their exposure is not expected. 
Concomitant  administration  of  atenolol  (50  mg)  or  diltiazem  (240  mg)  with  a  single  dose  of  10  mg 
ponesimod (without up-titration) in Study 111 suggested an additive PD effect on HR and AV conduction. 
Bradycardia and AV blocks were observed in both atenolol and diltiazem arms of this study, including 
one  life
threatening  collapse  with  a  1-minute  and  20-second  asystole  occurred  after  administration  of 
concomitant treatment of 50 mg atenolol and 10 mg of ponesimod as a single dose without titration. 
This study was terminated for safety reasons. No significant changes in the PK of ponesimod, atenolol 
‑
or diltiazem were observed in the limited number of subjects (n=5) who completed the study. 
In  a  second  DDI  study,  using  the  gradual  up-titration  regimen  (as  applied  in  Phase  3)  (Study  117), 
ponesimod was administered to subjects receiving beta-blocker propranolol (80 mg) once daily at steady 
state. No clinically relevant changes in the PK of ponesimod, propranolol, or 4-hydroxypropranolol were 
observed. Concomitant administration resulted in an additive effect on HR. The mean maximum decrease 
in  mean  hourly  HR  from  time-matched  baseline  for  the  combination  of  ponesimod  with  propranolol 
compared to ponesimod alone was 12.4 bpm and was observed on Day 5 (first dose of ponesimod 2 mg) 
and was 7.4 bpm on Day 19 (the first 20 mg dose after up-titration). The lowest mean of the HR nadir 
was  48.9  bpm  observed  on  Day  7  (third  day  of  the  ponesimod  up-titration  regimen,  when  3  mg 
ponesimod was administered) and increased to 54.1 bpm on Day 19. There were no drug-related SAEs 
in the study. No second degree or higher AV block, or clinically significant sinus pause (>3 seconds) was 
observed. Based on limited experience with concomitant use of beta-blockers in MS studies, ponesimod 
did not appear to increase the risk for cardiovascular events. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Due  to  the  old  up-titration  regimen  used  and  the  first-dose  effects  of  ponesimod,  AEs  leading  to 
ponesimod  treatment  discontinuation  on  Day  1  were  reported  at  a  higher  rate  in  B201  study  than  in 
Study  B301.  Nine  of  341  ponesimod-treated  subjects  (2.6%)  in  Study  B201  reported  TEAEs  in  the 
Cardiac  disorders  SOC  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  after  receiving  the  first  dose  of 
ponesimod  10  mg.  These  TEAEs  were  mostly  in  the  Cardiac  disorders  SOC  (second  degree  AV  block, 
bradycardia, palpitations, first degree AV block, AV dissociation, rhythm idioventricular) and 1 subject 
was discontinued due to TEAEs of ECG QT prolongation, somnolence, and vertigo. In contrast, in B301 
study, none of the reported AEs was serious or led to discontinuation of ponesimod. 
In the long-term pool, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment was 8.4% in 
the ponesimod 20 mg group. In the ponesimod 20 mg group, the SOCs with the most commonly (≥1%) 
reported  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  included  investigations  (1.6%),  eye 
disorders  (1.0%),  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (1.0%);  and  the  most  commonly 
(≥0.5%) reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were macular oedema (1.0%), 
dyspnoea (0.8%), and ALT increased (0.5%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database consists of the data from the phase 2 and phase 3 studies, which comprises a total 
of  2205  subjects  exposed  to  ponesimod,  including  1438  MS  subjects.  In  the  long-term  pool,  the 
cumulative  exposure  with  interruptions  excluded  was  4,094.28  subject-years  in  the  total  ponesimod 
group. A total of 1,027 (71.4%), 785 (54.6%), 253 (17.6%), and 41 (2.9%) subjects had exposure of 
at least 1, 2, 5, and 9 years, respectively. The safety database on ponesimod can be considered sufficient 
to allow for conclusions on safety. 
The applicant presented pooled analysis for 6 months (n=108 (10 mg), n=679 (20 mg) and n=119 (40 
mg)), 2 years (n=139 (10 mg), n=710 (20 mg) and n=151 (40 mg)) and long-term safety data (n=139 
(10 mg), n=1148 (20 mg) and n=151 (40 mg)). However, due to differences in titration regimen these 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Three  doses  i.e.  10  mg,  20  mg  and  40  mg  ponesimod  were  evaluated  and  compared  to  14  mg 
teriflunomide. 
The frequency of reported AEs is comparable between 20 mg ponesimod and 14 mg teriflunomide, i.e. 
88.8% and 88.2% for ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively. Comparable frequency 
between ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide are also reported for the majority of SOC. 
The  AESI  were  infections,  malignancies,  cardiovascular  effects,  pulmonary  effect,  increased  liver 
enzymes, macular oedema and neurological events. These were in line with the known safety profile for 
S1P modulators. The abnormalities induced by ponesimod were reversible after 2 years of treatment for 
the  effect  on  cardiac,  pulmonary  and  hepatic  parameters.  It  is  unclear  if  the  reversibility  remains 
following longer exposure.  
The majority of the AEs reported appears mild to moderate in nature. However, as the applicant does 
not always make a clear distinction between serious and severe AEs, it is not always clear for the safety 
of special interest whether the AEs were severe. Considering the withdrawal due to AEs, this appears 
not to be the case.  
In Study B301, a higher proportion of subjects experienced an AE leading to treatment discontinuation 
in  the  ponesimod  treatment  arm  compared  to  the  teriflunomide  treatment  arm,  i.e.  8.7%  vs  6.0% 
respectively.  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  by  PT  were 
dyspnoea (1.1% ponesimod 20 mg versus 0 teriflunomide 14 mg), increased ALT (0.9% vs 1.1%), and 
macular  oedema  (0.9%  vs  0).  These  are  known  safety  concerns  related  to  treatment  with  S1P 
modulators. The SmPC currently has sufficient warning concerning infections and macular oedema, the 
AEs in the SOC eye disorders leading to withdrawal. Additionally, macular oedema, a well-known class 
effect  of  S1P  modulators,  has  been  included  as  an  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP.  Furthermore, 
strict recommendations for patient discontinuation from the treatment due to potential hepatotoxicity 
have been added to the SmPC. In order to avoid severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity, it is recommended 
to withdraw patients from the treatment if ALT exceeds >3 times ULN (upper lower normal) and total 
bilirubin > 2 times ULN. 
A dose proportionate effect is observed for the AEs dyspnoea (4.6%, 6.1% and 14.3%), cough (0.9%, 
2.6% and 6.7%) and peripheral oedema (0.9%, 2.6% and 10.9%). This is expected as these AEs are 
related to the class effect of ponesimod.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 112/136 
 
  
 
 
Due to the known safety profile of S1P modulators patients with active infections, hepatic impairment, 
severe cardiac conditions and severe pulmonary compromised patients were excluded. Therefore, these 
patients are either contraindicated or additional warnings and precautions are included in the SmPC to 
ensure  safe  use  due  to  the  known  risks  associated  with  the  use  in  these  populations.  Moreover, 
bronchoconstriction  and  severe  liver  injury  are  included  in  the  RMP  as  important  identified  risk  and 
important potential risk, respectively.  
S1P  modulators  are  known  to  have  first  dose  effects,  i.e.  bradyarrhythmia  and  AV  conduction.  The 
applicant used 2 titration regimens during the clinical programme, i.e. a 15-days up-titration from 2 mg 
to the maintenance dose of 20 mg (2-2-3-3-4-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-10-10-20 mg) and an up-titration starting 
from 10 mg given for 7 days, followed by the 20 mg dose. Following the up-titration with a start dose of 
10 mg, bradyarrhythmia and secondary AV block were observed at first dose leading to withdrawal in 10 
(2.3%)  subjects.  No  subjects  withdrew  due  to  AEs  on  the  first  day  following  the  2  mg  up  titration 
regimen.  
In Study AC-058-115, at day 2 of dosing the maximum mean decrease of HR was 6 bpm and 12 bpm 
for the 2 mg and 10 mg first titration dose, respectively. From day 3, the difference in HR was negligible, 
indicating that tolerance may have been developed.  
Also, the incidence of bradycardia for the titration starting at 2 mg was 0.53%, while this was 0.89% for 
the titration starting at 10 mg. As the 2 mg titration regimen has a favourable safety profile, this regimen 
is proposed. 
Upon request, the applicant clarified that the evaluation of risk factors for symptomatic bradyarrhythmia 
will be done in all patients before initiation of ponesimod treatment. Evaluation will include an ECG to 
determine possible pre-existing risk factors. Recommendations are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
based  on  the  results  of  the  clinical  studies.  These  recommendations  are  consistent  with  the  label 
recommendations of other S1P modulators. Additionally, “bradyarrhythmia occurring post-first dose” has 
been added as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
No dose-related effect was seen for infection and infestations. In the long-term pool a similar frequency 
of  infections  and  infestation  is  reported  for  ponesimod  10  mg  and  40  mg  of  70.5%  and  70.9%, 
respectively. A substantial lower frequency of 48.3% is reported for ponesimod 20 mg. The same trend 
is observed for the 6-month pooled analysis, i.e. 40.7%, 27.0% and 36.1%, for ponesimod 10 mg, 20 
mg  and  40  mg,  respectively.  The  trend  is  barely  observed  in  the  2-year  pooled  analysis  where  the 
frequency of infections and infestations reported per treatment was 50.7% for 10 mg, 54.6% for 20 mg 
and 60.3% for 40 mg ponesimod. The reason for this could be related to differences in pool size, different 
titration  regimens,  etc.  and  further  clarification  is  not  considered  required.  In  line  with  other  S1P 
modulators, serious opportunistic infections including PML have been considered as important potential 
risks and therefore, dedicated warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Similarly, skin 
cancer and non-skin malignancy are identified as important potential risks in the RMP and will be active 
monitored in the PSURs.  
The incidence of adverse events in the reproductive and breast disorders SOC was comparable between 
ponesimod and teriflunomide, 28 (5.0%) for ponesimod 20mg and 34 (6.0%) in the teriflunomide 14mg 
group.  However,  the  applicant  agrees  that  these  AEs  are  anticipated  bases  on  non-clinical  data, 
mechanistic data and findings in products of the same class. Therefore, the applicant propose during the 
procedure the inclusion of the relevant statement in the SmPC including the contraindication in during 
pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception  (SmPC  4.3). 
Additionally,  it  is  supported  that  reproductive  and  embryofetal  toxicity  is  addressed  as  an  important 
potential risk in the safety concerns of the RMP and actively monitored in the PSUR.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021

During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  invited  to  further  discuss  on  reported  TEAEs  in  the  SOC  of 
Psychiatric  disorders.  It  was  clarified  that  subjects  with  reported  TEAEs  in  the  SOC  of  psychiatric 
disorders had a psychiatric disorder at baseline. The provided clarification is considered acceptable and 
further analysis suggests that there are no specific psychiatric safety issues related to ponesimod use.  
One percent (1.0%) of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg group had a seizure AESI and in the long-
term pool, a total of 16 (out of 1438) ponesimod-treated subjects reported a seizure AESI. In line with 
other  S1P  receptors,  convulsions  are  included  as  a  potential  important  risk  in  the  RMP  to  be  actively 
monitored in the PSUR.  
Several post-marketing case reports revealed an increased risk of paradoxically expanded inflammatory, 
demyelinating lesions (i.e. PRES) in patients treated with other S1P modulators. Although, the role of 
S1P  receptor  modulators  in  the  development  of  such  lesions  is  not  completely  clear,  increased  risk 
associated with exposure to S1P receptor modulators cannot be excluded. Therefore, the applicant has 
supplemented the safety information in the SmPC Section 4.4. of the SmPC by cautionary statements 
and has included “Unexpected neurological or psychiatric signs and symptoms (e.g. PRES, ADEM, atypical 
MS  relapses)”  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  to  follow  this  up  further  in  a  post-marketing 
setting.  
A total of 5 subjects died during the full clinical programme of ponesimod, e.g. not restricting to the MS 
indication. Three subjects were treated with ponesimod and 2 subjects with teriflunomide. Although the 
applicant indicates that this was not related to the treatment with ponesimod, this cannot be excluded, 
as the subjects had either pre-existing cardiac conditions or pre-existing hepatic impairment. Considering 
the effect of ponesimod on both the hepatic and cardiac system, this cannot be fully excluded.  
The  applicant  investigated  concomitant  treatment  with  hormonal  contraceptive,  beta-blockers  and 
calcium channel blockers. No effect on either the PK of PD was observed for hormonal contraceptive. An 
additive effect on the HR was observed for concomitant administration with beta-blockers and calcium 
channel blockers. In the first study which examined the concomitant use of beta-blockers and calcium 
channel blockers in healthy volunteers, 18 of the 23 subjects withdrew due to SAEs. This appeared to 
be related to the first dose effect of ponesimod. Study 117 showed that although an additive effect on 
HR is observed when beta-blockers are administered when ponesimod has reached a steady-state, no 
additional cardiac safety concerns emerged when the baseline HR was >55bpm. Therefore, ponesimod 
can be safely administered in subjects using a stable dose of beta-blockers and a resting HR >55. First-
dose 4-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per 
minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or 
heart failure occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation and in stable condition. This is 
also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Due to the limited long-term safety data and lack of data in elderly subjects, the applicant proposes to 
include these as missing information in the RMP. This is agreed to acquire more data. An additional post-
marketing study is not deemed necessary as these can be followed in a regular PSUR. However, it was 
questioned whether the submitted safety data could be generalised to older patients with late onset MS, 
especially considering potential hepatotoxicity and cardiovascular effects. The popPK modelling did not 
identify  any  specific  age-related  safety  issues.  However,  clinical  studies  of  ponesimod  did  not  include 
patients aged 65 years and older as stated in section 4.2. of the SmPC Furthermore, a specific warning 
has been added to Section 5.2 of the SmPC, therefore the proposed measures in the RMP are considered 
adequate.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The applicant provided an elaborate and complete analysis of the safety of ponesimod in MS patients.  
In general, ponesimod displays a risk profile that resembles in many respects the risk profile of other 
S1P  receptor  modulators,  i.e.  an  increased  risk  for  infection,  bradyarrhythmia  and  AV  conduction, 
increased liver enzymes, bronchoconstriction, macular oedema and teratogenicity.  
The SmPC of ponesimod covers this as the use in severe cardiac impaired, i.e. NYHA class III or IV heart 
failure and second or third degree AV block, and use in pregnancy is contraindicated. In addition warnings 
and  precautions  are  included  for  bradyarrhythmia  associated  with  the  first  dose  effect  (regardless  of 
having  known  heart  conditions),  (skin)  malignancies,  increased  risk  for  infections,  macular  oedema, 
bradyarrhythmia  and  atrioventricular  conduction  delay,  respiratory  effect, 
liver 
injury  and 
encephalopathy syndrome. These will also be monitored in a post-marketing setting.  
The  role  of  S1P  receptor  modulators  in  the  development  of  paradoxically  expanded  inflammatory, 
demyelinating lesions (i.e. PRES) is included in the RMP for post-marketing monitoring. However, the 
effect on respiratory impairment should also be monitored post-marketing as the effect on respiratory 
decline is only partially reversible when discontinuing the treatment. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  ponesimod  does  not  lead  to  a  negative  B/R,  as  the  safety  profile  is  well 
known, can be monitored, and has been accepted for other S1P modulators.

Risk Minimisation Measures 
•  Assessments of CBC are recommended 
periodically during treatment with 
ponesimod; confirmed absolute lymphocyte 
counts <0.2x109/L should lead to 
interruption of ponesimod therapy; re-
initiation of ponesimod can be considered 
when the level reaches >0.8x109/L, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4. 
Treatment initiation with ponesimod should 
be delayed in patients with severe active 
infection until resolution. Vigilance for 
signs and symptoms of infection should be 
continued for 1 to 2 weeks after treatment 
discontinuation, as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4. Before starting treatment, 
patients are advised to tell their doctor if 
they have a fever or infection, as described 
in PL Section 2. 
Effective diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies should be used in patients with 
symptoms of infection while on ponesimod 
therapy. Suspension of ponesimod treatment 
should be considered if a patient develops a 
serious infection, as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4. 
Patients without an HCP-confirmed history 
of varicella (chickenpox) or without 
documentation of a full course of 
vaccination against VZV should be tested 
for antibodies to VZV before treatment 
initiation with ponesimod, as described in 
SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. Before 
starting treatment, patients are advised to 
tell their doctor if they never had 
chickenpox (varicella) or have not received 
a vaccine for chickenpox, as described in PL 
Section 2. 
Physicians should be vigilant for clinical 
signs or symptoms of CM. Patients with 
signs or symptoms consistent with a 
cryptococcal infection should undergo 
prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment. 
Ponesimod treatment should be suspended 
until a cryptococcal infection has been 
excluded; if CM is diagnosed, appropriate 
treatment should be initiated, as described in 
SmPC Section 4.4. 
Physicians should be vigilant for clinical 
symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of 
PML. If PML is suspected, ponesimod 
treatment should be suspended until PML is 
excluded. Treatment with ponesimod should 
be discontinued if PML is confirmed, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4.

described in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL 
Section 2. 
The use of live, attenuated vaccines should 
be avoided while on ponesimod therapy and 
up to 1 week after treatment 
discontinuation. If immunisation with a live 
attenuated vaccine is required, ponesimod 
treatment should be paused from 1 week 
prior to 4 weeks after a planned vaccination, 
as described in SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5 
and PL Section 2. Before starting treatment, 
patients are advised to tell their doctor if 
they have recently received any 
vaccinations or are planning to receive a 
vaccination, as described in PL Section 2. 
Patients who experience symptoms of 
infection during treatment or 1 week after 
the last dose should call their physician 
immediately, as described in PL Sections 2

Before starting treatment, patients are 
advised to tell their doctor if they have an 
immune system that does not work properly 
due to a disease or are taking medicines that 
weaken their immune system, as described

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.03.2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  compared  the  structure  of  ponesimod  with  active  substances  contained  in  authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ponesimod to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
Minimum particulars have been granted to be used on the blisters sealed inside a wallet (i.e. name of 
the medicinal product, strength, INN, EXP and Lot). 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Ponvory  (ponesimod)  is  included  in  the 
additional  monitoring  list  as  It  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ponesimod is an iminothiazolidinone derivative, and is an orally active, selective S1P1 modulator. The 
proposed indication is  
Ponvory is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) 
with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. 
MS  is  an  inflammatory  autoimmune  and  neurodegenerative  disorder  of  the  CNS.  This  disease  is 
characterised by a heterogeneous clinical expression, an unpredictable course, and a variable prognosis. 
MS is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, neuronal and oligodendrocyte loss, and disruption 
of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  leading  to  irreversible  deficits  in  physical  function  and  cognition  and  an 
impaired quality of life. 
The aim of treating RMS with DMT is to modify the natural course of the disease by reducing the rate of 
relapses and the appearance of new focal inflammatory lesions in order to delay disability progression. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/206970/2021  
Page 128/136 
 
  
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Therapies for MS include treatments for relapse (e.g. steroids)  and those that alter the course of the 
disease (DMTs).  
There are currently several approved DMTs in MS with different efficacy and safety profiles. The injectable 
IFN (IFN β-1a and β-1b) and glatiramer acetate have a well-established efficacy and safety profile. Due 
to  the  rather  moderate  efficacy,  these  as  well  as  other  first-line  treatments  dimethyl  fumarate  and 
teriflunomide are usually prescribed to patients without high disease activity. 
The monoclonal DMTs (alemtuzumab, natalizumab) are restricted to subjects with highly active disease. 
Because  of  their  safety  profile,  the  benefit-risk  ratio  in  low  active  multiple  sclerosis  was  assessed  as 
negative. Anti-C20 monoclonal DMTs such as ocrelizumab and ofatumumab are indicated for active RRMS 
and RMS, respectively 
There are currently three registered S1P modulators fingolimod, ozanimod and siponimod. The latter is 
indicated in SPMS only. The use of the first registered S1P modulator, i.e. fingolimod, has been restricted 
to RRMS patients with highly active disease due to its safety profile. However, recently ozanimod has 
been  approved  for  a  broad  indication  in  RRMS.  The  safety  profile  of  ozanimod,  although  similar  to 
fingolimod, was considered manageable with the risk minimisation procedure in place, to allow a broad 
RRMS indication. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of ponesimod were examined in a single pivotal study in patients with RMS. This 
study was a multicentre, randomised, DB, parallel-group, active-controlled, superiority study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of ponesimod (N=567) to teriflunomide (N=566). The treatment period was 108 
weeks,  which  included  an  up-titration  period  of  14  days.  The  study  included  one  dose  strength  of 
ponesimod, i.e. 20 mg QD. 
The study included both patients with RRMS and SPMS, with confirmed disease activity, i.e. one or more 
relapse with onset within the period of 12 to 1 months prior to baseline, or two or more relapses with 
onset within the period of 24 to 1 months prior to baseline assessment, or who had one or more Gd+ 
lesion(s) prior to baseline EDSS assessment. 
The primary endpoint was ARR. The secondary endpoints were FSIQ-RMS, CUALs, 12-week CDA and 24-
week CDA. The testing hierarchy as chosen by the applicant is not agreed, as disability progression is 
considered the key secondary endpoint after ARR. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  ARR  was  0.202  (99%  CI  0.165,  0.246)  in  the  ponesimod  group  as  compared  to  0.290  (99%  CI 
0.244, 0.345) in the teriflunomide group. The RR was 0.695 (99% CL 0.536, 0.902; p=0.0003). 
A 12-week CDA was observed in 10.1% and 12.4% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide 
14 mg groups, respectively. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.58, 1.18; p=0.2939) with ponesimod 20 mg 
compared to teriflunomide 14 mg. 
A 24-week CDA was observed in 8.1% and 9.9% of subjects in the ponesimod 20 mg and teriflunomide 
14 mg groups, respectively. The HR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.57, 1.24; nominal p=0.3720) with ponesimod 
20 mg compared to teriflunomide 14 mg.

The LS mean change from baseline to week 108 in FSIQ-RMS was -0.01 (95% CI -1.60, 1.58) in the 
ponesimod group and 3.56 (95% CI 1.96, 5.16) in the teriflunomide groups. The difference of LS means 
was -3.57 (95% CL -5.83, -1.32; p=0.0019). 
The mean CUALs was 1.405 (95% CI 1.215, 1.624) in the ponesimod group and 3.164 ( 95% CI 2.757, 
3.631) in the teriflunomide group. The RR was 0.444 (95% CI 0.364, 0.542; p<0.0001). 
29.3% of patients in the ponesimod experienced a relapse up to the end of the study, as compared to 
39.4% of patients in the teriflunomide group. HR of time to first relapse was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62, 0.93; 
nominal p=0.0081) 
The LS mean difference (ponesimod 20 mg − teriflunomide 14 mg) in change from baseline to Week 108 
in EDSS score was −0.13 (95% CIs: −0.22, −0.04; nominal p=0.0059) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The observed effect on fatigue, as measured by the FSIQ-RMS is not clinically relevant. As the scale 
was not validated in a clinical study before, it is unclear whether the lack of effect on the scale is a 
failure of the scale or the treatment. 
Ponesimod failed to show superiority to teriflunomide in disability progression. 
A limited number of patients with active SPMS was included in the study. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In  Study  B301,  the  frequency  of  reported  AEs  was  88.8%  and  88.2%  for  ponesimod  20  mg  and 
teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively. The AEs occurring in at least 5% of subjects were reasonably balanced 
between  treatment  groups:  nasopharyngitis  (19.3%  vs  16.8%),  headache  (11.5%  vs  12.7%),  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  (10.6  vs  10.4%),  hypertension  (8.0%  vs  7.8%),  nausea  (7.6%  vs  8.3%), 
fatigue (6.0% vs 6.5%), back pain (5.8% vs 6.7%), urinary tract infection (5.7% vs 5.1%), but increased 
for ALT increased (19.5% for ponesimod 20mg vs 9.4% teriflunomide 14mg), AST increased (6.4% vs 
3.5%), dyspnoea (5.3% vs 1.2%), and decreased for depression (3.7% vs 5.1%), diarrhoea (3.5% vs 
7.8%) and alopecia (3.2% vs 12.7%) 
In the long term pool the AEs reported with a frequency of ≥5% in the 20 mg ponesimod group were: 
nasopharyngitis (17.5%), ALT increased (16.4%), headache (10.9%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(9.8%), hypertension (6.9%), fatigue (6.6%), back pain (6.5%), urinary tract infection (5.8%), nausea 
(5.2%), AST increased (5.1%). 
In Study B301, serious AEs were experienced by approximately 10% of the subjects, i.e. 8.7% of the 
ponesimod 20mg group and 8.1% in the teriflunomide group. The serious AEs reported in >2 subjects 
in the 20 mg ponesimod group were appendicitis (3 subjects, 0.5%), abdominal pain (3 subjects, 0.5%). 
In  the  teriflunomide  group,  the  serious  AEs  cholelithiasis  occurred  in  more  >2  subjects  (3  subjects, 
0.5%).  
The incidence of AEs in the reproductive and breast disorders SOC was 28 (5.0%) for ponesimod 20mg 
and 34 (6.0%) in the teriflunomide 14mg group. 
In the long-term pool, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment was 8.4% in 
the  ponesimod  20  mg  group.  In  study  B301,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  AE  leading  to 
treatment discontinuation was 8.7% for ponesimod 20 mg and 6.0% for 14mg teriflunomide. The most 
Assessment report

commonly  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  were  dyspnoea  (1.1%  ponesimod  20 
mg versus 0 teriflunomide 14 mg), increased ALT (0.9% vs 1.1%) and macular oedema (0.9% vs 0). 
A total of 3 deaths were reported in the MS phase 2/3 studies (1 subject treated with ponesimod), and 
two  additional  deaths  occurred  in  non-MS  studies.  Three  subjects  were  treated  with  ponesimod.  The 
causes of death were sudden cardiac death (2 subjects) and hepatic failure (1 subject). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Different  up-titration  regimens  were  used  during  the  clinical  programme;  therefore,  the  dose-related 
AEs, particularly in the long-term pool should be interpreted with caution. 
Comparative data to teriflunomide is not available for the long-term safety data, as subjects switched to 
ponesimod 20mg.  
Due to the known safety profile of S1P modulators patients with active infections, hepatic impairment, 
severe cardiac conditions and severe pulmonary compromised patients were excluded. The SmPC has 
been  updated  to  includes  contraindication  for  these  subjects  and  monitoring  for  signs  of  these  in  the 
section warning and precautions for use. Furthermore, these will be actively followed in the RMP. 
Assessment  of  cardiac  function  including  ECG  is  conducted  in  all  patients  starting  treatment  with 
ponesimod in order to capture patients with latent/undiagnosed arrhythmias and conduction disorders.  
Additionally, bronchoconstriction is included in the RMP as an identified important risk and will be actively 
monitored in the PSUR. 
There is limited long-term safety data and no experience of ponesimod in elderly subjects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ponesimod demonstrated superiority of teriflunomide in ARR. The strength of evidence is strong, as the 
primary null hypothesis was tested with a two-sided alpha level of 1%, as recommended by CHMP in SA.

As  preventing  relapses  is  an  accepted  treatment  goal  of  DMT  for  MS,  ponesimod  addresses  this  goal 
effectively.  The  requirements  for  a  single  pivotal  trial  are  mostly  met.  The  study  population  is 
representative  of  the  target  population;  thus,  external  validity  is  fulfilled.  The  effect  size  is  clinically 
relevant and clearly statistically significant. The effect was in general consistent across subgroups; thus, 
internal consistency is fulfilled. A clear superiority of ponesimod over teriflunomide was demonstrated in 
MRI outcomes, including CUALs.  
A limited number of patients with SPMS was included in the study. However, as efficacy in relapses can 
be extrapolated from RRMS to SPMS, the indication RMS would in principle be acceptable. 
Ponesimod  failed  to  show  superiority  to  teriflunomide  in  disability  progression.  It  is  noted  that  not 
demonstrating statistically significant differences in disability progression vs. another DMT is not unusual 
in RMS studies, considering the current, low relapse rates and slow disability progression in general in 
RMS population included in clinical studies. 
Fatigue is considered a relevant outcome to examine in a clinical study in patients with MS. The applicant 
developed  a  patient-reported  outcome  to  assess  MS-associated  fatigue,  and  a  statistically  significant 
difference in favour of ponesimod was demonstrated in the pivotal study, which was seen at week 60 of 
treatment. However, the difference between the groups, or the change from baseline, is not considered 
clinically relevant. Moreover, there was no improvement from baseline in fatigue score under ponesimod 
treatment. There was a worsening in fatigue score in the teriflunomide arm. The statistically significant 
difference was due to a worsening in the control arm. This is not unexpected due to the fact that in the 
control  arm  more  relapses  occurred  with  persisting  symptoms  contributing  to  the  fatigue.  Thus 
ponesimod has not demonstrated a positive effect on fatigue, which is a debilitating symptom in many 
patients with MS. 
The safety profile is in line with that known for S1P modulators, i.e. having a bradyarrhythmia at first 
doses,  the  risk  for  malignancies,  macular  oedema,  hepatotoxicity  and  respiratory  impairment 
(dyspnoea). Bradyarrhythmia was no longer reported following the proposed careful up-titration regimen 
in patients with a HR >55 bpm. Moreover, the evaluation of risk factors for symptomatic bradyarrhythmia 
will be done in all patients before initiation of ponesimod treatment. Recommendations are included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. These are consistent with the label recommendations of other S1P modulators.  
The  AEs  malignancies,  macular  oedema,  hepatotoxicity  and  respiratory  impairment  can  be  severe  in 
nature and do not resolve on their own. However, these AEs can be monitored and managed. For the 
RRMS population, these AEs are considered acceptable for other S1P modulators.  Moreover, the use of 
the non-selective S1P modulator in the market for more than 9 years proved that the risk minimisation 
measures are efficacious. The safety issues are, therefore considered manageable and do not preclude 
a positive benefit-risk. 
AEs  in  the  SOC  reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders  are  anticipated  based  on  non-clinical  data, 
mechanistic  data and findings in products of the same class. Relevant statements are included in the 
SmPC; active monitoring in the PSUR is not considered necessary. 
There  is  no  experience  in  the  elderly  population,  however,  the  popPK  modelling  did  not  identify  any 
specific  age-related  safety  issues.  Therefore  the  post  marketing  follow  up  in  the  PSUR  is  considered 
adequate.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ponesimod  clearly  demonstrated  superiority  to  teriflunomide  in  relapse  rate  and  MRI  outcomes  in 
patients with RMS. Based on these data, ponesimod offers an effective alternative for the treatment of 
RMS. 
The safety profile of ponesimod is well known, can be monitored and has been accepted for other S1P 
modulators. Therefore, the safety concerns raised do not preclude a positive B/R. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ponvory is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ponesimod is a new active 
substance  as  it  is  not  a  constituent  of  a  medicinal  product  previously  authorised  within  the  European 
Union.

Introduction 
In December, 2015, the MAH submitted an on-going stand-alone paediatric study, in which Synflorix is 
a co-administered vaccine, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. The part of 
the study involving Synflorix is completed. The study vaccine was GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ 
Plasmodium falciparum and hepatitis B vaccine (RTS,S/AS01 E or Mosquirix). This vaccine is proposed 
for the active immunisation of children aged 6 weeks up to 17 months against malaria caused by 
Plasmodium falciparum and against hepatitis B.  
The MAH stated that the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Synflorix.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

CHMP comment: 
In this report, only the response to a booster dose of Synflorix as well as immunogenicity and safety 
data collected from months 8-26 is presented and assessed. The objectives listed above only represent 
those related to the data included in this report. For a complete list of objectives (i.e. related to other 
vaccines), refer to the complete study protocol.  
Study design 
• 
Experimental design: Phase III, multi-center, open, randomized, controlled trial with 11 study 
groups.  
•  Subjects were randomized into 11 study groups in a 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 3 : 3 ratio (this 
means five treatment groups of which the three RTS,S/AS01E groups were randomized to 
receive three different lots).  
•  Blood sampling (see Synopsis Table 1 for group labeling):  
o  Groups RERo[P], RE[RoP] and HERo[P] will have a total of seven blood samples taken 
for immunogenicity assessment: at Visit 1 (screening) and post Dose 3 of 
RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B: Visit 8 (Month 3), 10 (Month 14), 13 (Month 26), 14 
(Month 38), 15 (Month 50), and 16 (Month 51).  
o  Groups REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro] will have a total of 8 blood samples taken for 
immunogenicity assessment: at Visit 1 (screening) and post Dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01E or

study, who were born to a mother seronegative for HBsAg and human immunodeficiency virus and for 
whom the investigator believed that the parents/legally acceptable representatives would comply with 
the requirements of the protocol. The infants enrolled were living in Ghana and Burkina Faso. Results 
of laboratory screening tests for alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count and 
total white cell count had to be within pre-defined limits. Subjects should not have received previous 
vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, B. pertussis (whole-cell or acellular), Haemophilus influenzae type 
B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, hepatitis B vaccine or rotavirus vaccine. Signed or thumb-printed 
informed consent was obtained from the parents/legally acceptable representatives of each subject.  
Treatments 
The duration of the study is approximately 52 months for each subject (including the screening period 
and 49 months of follow-up after the third vaccination of RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B).  
Subjects were randomized in 5 treatment groups of which the three RTS,S/AS01E groups were 
randomized to receive three different RTS,S/AS01 E lots. In treatment groups REP[Ro], RERo[P] and 
RE[RoP], three doses of RTS,S/AS01 E were co-administered with DTPa/Hib (Infanrix/Hib) and OPV 
(Polio Sabin) at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age with, according to the treatment group, two doses of a 
rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) and/or three doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Synflorix) co-
administered or staggered. The control groups (HEP[Ro]s and HERo[P]s) received a licensed hepatitis 
B vaccine (Engerix-B) co-administered with Infanrix/Hib+Polio Sabin and either Rotarix or Synflorix.  
All groups received Synflorix and Infanrix/Hib booster vaccinations at approximately 18 months of age. 
The report included in the present submission descibes the data from study month 8 (week 32) to 
study month 26 and presents the immunogenicity results for all subjects up to one month post-booster 
dose of Synflorix. 
The study is still ongoing. An Engerix-B booster dose will be administered 48 months after the third 
dose of the primary vaccination schedule. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Only secondary outcomes related to the data presented in this report are listed here, i.e. data related 
to the immunogenicity and safety of Synflorix. For the complete list of primary and secondary 
outcomes, please refer to the study protocol.

Statistical Methods 
Analyses were performed as per protocol and per Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The present annex report includes all analyses performed on data collected from Month 8 (Visit 9) up 
to Month 26 (Visit 13) and included secondary immunogenicity and safety endpoints. Additionally, 
safety data from study start until Month 26 were reported.  
Demography analyses were presented for the treatment groups, the pooled lot groups, and for the 
pooled group for primary endpoint. Study flow diagrams (Consort) were generated to present the 
number of subjects receiving doses and included in according-to-protocol (ATP) analyses. Summary of 
demographic characteristics (age at booster vaccination and gender) of each cohort was tabulated by 
group. The mean age at booster vaccination (in months) (plus range and standard deviation) of the 
vaccinated subjects, as a whole, and per group, was calculated.  
The immunogenicity follow-up (FU) 1 analysis was based on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
analysis FU 1. Immunogenicity analysis was performed by treatment group, pooled lot group and/or 
pooled group for the primary endpoint. In some cases, depending on antigen, descriptive analyses 
were performed by treatment group for each site. Descriptive analysis by treatment group was also 
performed on the Total vaccinated cohort.  
Immune response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine antigens; descriptive analysis. For each vaccine 
serotype (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F), the percentage of seropositive subjects, i.e. with 
serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 µg/ml, with 95% CI were 
determined at each blood sampling timepoint for the groups REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro]. For each vaccine 
serotype, the proportion of subjects with serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal antibody concentration ≥ 
0.2 µg/ml was also tabulated. The distribution of antibody concentrations was summarized with 95% 
CI at all timepoints at which serological samples were taken. Antibody concentrations after the booster 
dose were also investigated using RCCs. The same analysis was repeated on data resulting from 
opsonophagocytic assay and anti-pneumococcal protein D.  
Analysis of safety. This Annex Report presents fatal SAEs, related SAEs and pIMDs reported between 
Month 8 and Month 26 and from study start until Month 26. Longer follow-up will be reported in further 
Annex Reports.

Baseline data 
Infants included in the study were 8 to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. A total of 
705 subjects of 8.3 weeks of age (SD ±0.7 weeks) were enrolled and vaccinated in this study. 
Immune response to Synflorix 
Immune response to the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D (PD) of Synflorix was 
measured 1 month after the booster dose of Synflorix in the REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro] groups.  
For each vaccine pneumococcal serotype, at least 98.5% of subjects who previously received Synflorix 
with RTS,S/AS01 E (REP[Ro]) presented antibody concentration ≥0.2 µg/ml (ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity – FU 1, Table 2). Among subjects who initially received Synflorix with a licensed 
hepatitis B vaccine (HEP[Ro]), these percentages were at least 98.4%. Compared to one month post-
dose 3, robust increase in antibody GMCs were observed for a majority of vaccine pneumococcal 
serotypes in both groups. Following the primary vaccination course, the non-inferiority of the antibody 
response to pneumococcal serotypes when Synflorix was co-administered with RTS,S/AS01 E was 
demonstrated for all the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, except the serotype 18C (refer to procedure 
EMA/H/C/973/P46 056). The descriptive immunogenicity data presented in this report showed a similar 
booster response in both REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro] groups for this 18C serotypes (Table 2). 
For each vaccine pneumococcal serotype, at least 86.2% of subjects who previously received the 
Synflorix with RTS,S/AS01 E (REP[Ro]) presented opsonophagocytic titers ≥8, while among subjects 
who initially received the Synflorix with a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (HEP[Ro]), these percentages 
were at least 90.9% (Table 3). Compared to one month post-dose 3, robust increases in OPA GMTs 
were observed for a majority of vaccine pneumococcal serotypes in both groups. 
With respect to the immune response to the protein D, 99.2% of subjects who initially received the 
Synflorix with RTS,S/AS01 E (REP[Ro]) or with a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (HEP[Ro]) were

seropositive for anti-PD antibodies (≥100 EU/ml). The anti-PD antibody GMTs were 2648.3 EU/ml 
(95% CI: 2194.2 to 3196.4) and 2819.1 EU/ml (95% CI: 2391.1 to 3323.7) in the REP[Ro] and 
HEP[Ro] groups, respectively. 
CHMP comment: 
The immune response of Synflorix to the pneumococcal serotypes and protein D did not markedly 
differ between the two groups previously receiving the study vaccine RTS,S/AS01E and Engerix-B, 
respectively. The booster dose resulted in robust increases in antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs, as 
compared to one month post-dose 3, for most of the pneumococcal serotypes included.

Safety results 
During the study period from month 8 to month 26, only SAEs judged to be related to vaccination, 
fatal SAEs and potential immune-mediated disorders (pIMD) were to be reported. As the Synflorix 
booster dose was co-administered with an Infanrix/Hib booster dose, no safety data on Synflorix 
booster dose alone is being reported. 
Over the period from month 8 up to month 26, no subjects reported SAEs judged to be related to 
vaccination by the investigator and no pIMD was reported. 
Over the period from month 8 up to month 26, fatal SAEs were reported for one subject from the 
RERo[P] group, two subjects from the HEP[Ro] group and one subject from the HERo[P] group. 
CHMP comment: 
Over the period included in this report, fatal SAEs were reported by four subjects in different groups. 
No SAEs were judged as related to vaccination and no pIMDs were identified. As Synflorix was not 
administered alone, it is difficult to draw any conclusions on the safety profile of the single vaccine. 
Overall, the safety data did not raise any unforeseen safety issues. 
1.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The booster dose of Synflorix in subjects who initially received Synflorix with RTS,S/AS01E (REP[Ro]) 
or a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (HEP[Ro]) was immunogenic and elicited increases in antibody GMC 
and OPA GMT for the majority of vaccine pneumococcal serotypes (ATP cohort for immunogenicity).  
In terms of safety, over the period from Month 8 up to Month 26, fatal SAEs were reported by four 
subjects (one in the RERo[P] group, two in the HEP[Ro] group and one in the HERo[P] group). No SAEs 
related to vaccination and no pIMDs were identified.  
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
This article 46 submission is considered satisfactory and no further regulatory action regarding 
Synflorix is required.

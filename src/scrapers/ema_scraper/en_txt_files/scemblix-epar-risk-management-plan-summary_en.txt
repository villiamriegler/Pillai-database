Summary of the risk management plan for Scemblix® (asciminib)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP) for  Scemblix.  The  RMP 
details  important risks of Scemblix, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Scemblix’s  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information).
Scemblix’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL)
give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Scemblix should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Scemblix  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Scemblix’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Scemblix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia 
chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP)
previously treated with 2 or more TKIs.
Scemblix contains asciminib hydrochloride, a salt-form of asciminib which  is the 
active substance, and it is given orally.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Scemblix’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Scemblix’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the 
the  medicine’s  webpage:
European  Medicines  Agency  website,  under 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/scemblix.
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Scemblix, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Scemblix’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analyzed,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If  important information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Scemblix  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Scemblix are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Scemblix. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal  product that  is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Current  evidence  is  based  on  nonclinical  studies  and 
clinical  studies.  Cardiac  malformations  along  with 
increased  visceral  and  skeletal  variants  have  been 
observed in rats. Also, increased incidence of resorptions 
(embryofetal  mortality)  and  a  low  incidence  of  cardiac 
malformations (dysmorphogenesis) have been observed 
in rabbits. Reproductive toxicity has not been observed 
with asciminib with the exclusion of pregnant women and 
the requirement to use effective contraception methods. 
Males taking asciminib should not require contraception.

 Characterize

This  study 
information on safety and tolerability in patients with 
Ph+ CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Key study objectives include:
 To determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or 
recommended dose for expansion of asciminib as 
single  agent  and  in  combination  with  other  TKIs 
(imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib).
the  safety  and 
tolerability  of 
asciminib as single agent and in combination with 
other TKIs (imatinib or nilotinib or dasatinib).
There remains an unmet need for new compounds in 
patients  with  CML  who  have  failed  at  least  2  prior 
TKIs.  Current  practice  suggests  that  a  second 
generation (2G)-TKI will have been used for first line 
therapy  for  about  one  half of  patients  with  CML, 
meaning that most patients who have failed at least 
2 prior TKIs will have failed at least 1 if not 2 2G-TKIs 
(such as dasatinib and/or nilotinib). Potentially, such 
patients  may  also  have  failed  bosutinib  and/or 
ponatinib. Patients having failed at least 2 TKIs may 
have  limited  sensitivity  to  the  remaining  available 
agents  and,  thus,  there  exists  a  need  for  new  safe 
and  effective  therapy.  In  addition,  mutations  will 
have developed in 21 to 33% of patients that prevent 
the  use  of  specific  TKIs,  increasing  the  need  for  a 
better and alternative compound.
Omacetaxine, a chemotherapeutic agent, is available 
for  patients  who  have  failed  at  least  2  prior  TKIs 
under these conditions but only in the United States
and  Canada.  This  agent  is  not  available  for  most 
patients globally, where a bigger unmet medical need 
is  present.  Thus,  there  remains  an  unmet  need  for 
patients  with  CML  who  have  failed  at  least  2  prior 
TKIs despite the existence of multiple agents.
Key study objectives include:
 To compare the major molecular response (MMR) 
rate at 24 weeks of asciminib versus bosutinib.
 To  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of 
asciminib versus bosutinib.

Rationale and study objectives
Study CABL001A2302: 
Asciminib treatment 
optimization in ≥ 3rd 
line CML-CP
Study CABL001A2001B: 
Study to assess long-
term safety in patients 
who have completed a 
Novartis-sponsored 
asciminib study and are 
judged by the 
investigator to benefit 
from continued 
treatment.
The purpose of the study is to optimize the treatment 
of  asciminib  in  patients  with  CML-CP  previously 
treated with 2 or more TKIs. Patients for this study 
will  be  identified  based  on  warning  criteria  and 
resistance definition following European LeukemiaNet
2020  recommendations.  In  addition,  the  study  will 
investigate the use of 2 different posology. For this, 
patients  will  be  randomized  to  either  receive 
asciminib  40 mg  b.i.d. or of 80 mg q.d. In patients 
not  achieving  MMR  at  48  weeks  or  losing  the 
response after the week 48 assessment up to Week 
108, asciminib dose may be escalated to 200 mg q.d. 
if in the investigator’s opinion the patient may benefit 
from  the  escalation.  In  addition,  there  must  not  be 
any  grade  3  or  4  toxicity  while  on  therapy,  or 
persistent  grade  2  toxicity,  possibly  related  to 
asciminib and unresponsive to optimal management.
Key study objective includes:
 To  estimate  the  MMR  of  all  the  patients  at 
Week 48  with  CML-CP  following  2  or  more  prior 
TKI  treatments  and  with  no  evidence  of  MMR  at 
baseline.
The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  assess  long  term 
safety  of  asciminib  and  to  provide  continued 
treatment  to  participants  who  have  previously 
participated  in  an  asciminib  Novartis-sponsored 
study  and  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator, 
would  benefit  from  continuing  treatment,  to  ensure 
treatment  continuity  for  participants  as  in  their 
parent study, or from switching to asciminib, but are 
unable to access treatment outside of a clinical study.
Key study objective includes:
 To  assess  long  term  safety  data  and  provide 
continued access to the study treatment received 
in the parent study protocol.

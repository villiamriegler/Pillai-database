side of the tablet and FX3 on the other side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred 
(including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). Febuxostat Viatris is 
indicated in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended oral dose of Febuxostat Viatris is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If 
serum uric acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, Febuxostat Viatris 120 mg once 
daily may be considered. 
Febuxostat Viatris works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 
weeks. The therapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL 
(357 μmol/L). 
Gout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
The efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh Class C). 
The recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited information 
is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and the efficacy of febuxostat in children aged below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Febuxostat Viatris should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also 
section 4.8). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardio-vascular disorders 
In patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or 
unstable angina), during the development of the product and in one post registrational study 
(CARES), a higher number of fatal cardiovascular events were observed with febuxostat when 
compared to allopurinol. 
However, in a subsequent post registrational study (FAST), febuxostat was not inferior to 
allopurinol in the incidence of both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. 
Treatment of this patient group should be exercised cautiously and they should be monitored 
regularly. For further details on cardiovascular safety of febuxostat refer to section 4.8 and 5.1. 
Medicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity 
Rare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have 
been collected in the post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during 
the first month of therapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal 
impairment and/or previous hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, 
including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated 
with fever, haematological, renal or hepatic involvement in some cases. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately 
stopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, 
occur since early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic 
reaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time.

Acute gouty attacks (gout flare) 
Febuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely 
subsided. Gout flares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid 
levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see section 4.8 and 5.1). At 
treatment initiation with febuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or 
colchicine is recommended (see section 4.2). 
If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare 
should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment 
with febuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares. 
Xanthine deposition 
In patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and 
its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in 
rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. As there has been no 
experience with febuxostat, its use in these populations is not recommended. 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
Febuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause 
increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe 
toxicity. Where the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine to the 20 % or less of the previously prescribed dose is 
recommended in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see sections 4.5 and 5.3). 
The patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should 
be subsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of 
eventual toxic effects. 
Organ transplant recipients 
As there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such 
patients is not recommended (see section 5.1). 
Theophylline 
Co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400 mg single dose in healthy subjects 
showed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be 
used in patients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline 
plasma levels. No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Liver disorders 
During the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were 
observed in patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to 
the initiation of therapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment 
(see section 5.1). 
Thyroid disorders 
Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with 
febuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
febuxostat is used in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1). 
Excipients 
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicine. 
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
On the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not 
recommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of 
these drugs leading to myelotoxicity. In case of concomitant administration with febuxostat, the 
dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less of the previously 
prescribed dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).  
The adequacy of the proposed dose adjustment, which was based on a modelling and simulation 
analysis from preclinical data in rats, was confirmed by the results of a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study in healthy volunteers, receiving azathioprine 100 mg alone and a reduced dose 
of azathioprine (25 mg) in combination with febuxostat (40 or 120 mg). 
Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been 
conducted. No data is available regarding the safety of febuxostat during other cytotoxic 
therapy. 
Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
coadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, 
indicating that febuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of 
febuxostat with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose 
adjustment for those compounds. 
Theophylline 
An interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether 
the inhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported 
with other XO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of 
febuxostat 80 mg QD with theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. Therefore no special caution is advised when 
febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given concomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 
120 mg. 
Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation 
Febuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. 
Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in 
theory affect the elimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat 
and naproxen 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 
28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors was not related to any clinically significant increase in adverse events. 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or 
naproxen being necessary. 
Inducers of glucuronidation 
Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased 
efficacy of febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after 
start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment 
of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat. 
Colchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of 
febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. 
Administration of febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not 
affected by the co- administration of febuxostat. 
Desipramine/CYP2D6 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
120 mg febuxostat QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 
substrate indicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in 
vivo. 
Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to require 
any dose adjustment for those compounds. 
Antacids 
Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium 
hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to 
cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, 
febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of 
febuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal 
development or parturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. 
Febuxostat should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A risk to a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breast-
feeding. 
Fertility 
In animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects 
on fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of febuxostat on human fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Somnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of 
febuxostat. Patients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in 
dangerous activities until they are reasonably certain that febuxostat does not adversely affect 
performance. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least 
with a dose from 10 mg to 300 mg), post-authorisation safety studies (FAST study: 
3001subjects treated at least with a dose from 80 mg to 120 mg) and post-marketing experience 
are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dizziness, dysponea, 
rash, pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, oedema and fatigue. These adverse 
reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to 
febuxostat, some of which were associated to systemic symptoms and rare events of sudden 
cardiac death, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) 
adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with febuxostat are listed below. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

#   Adverse reactions coming from post-authorisation safety studies 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, 
Toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-
marketing experience. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are 
characterised by progressive skin rashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye 
irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
skin reactions characterised by infiltrated maculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative 
rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, haematologic abnormalities such as 
thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ involvement (liver and kidney 
including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4). 
Gout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first 
months. Thereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout 
flare prophylaxis is recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Patients with an overdose should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparation, preparations inhibiting uric acid production, 
ATC code: M04AA03 
Mechanism of action 
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of 
hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by 
xanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic 
effect of decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-
purine selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one 
nanomolar. Febuxostat has been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms 
of XO. At therapeutic concentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in 
purine or pyrimidine metabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate 
decarboxylase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal 
APEX and FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study described below) that were 
conducted in 4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, 
febuxostat demonstrated superior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared 
to allopurinol. The primary efficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the 
proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly serum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL 
(357 µmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, for which results became available 
after the marketing authorisation for febuxostat was first issued, the primary efficacy endpoint 
was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL at the final visit. No 
patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 4.2). 
APEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and 
seventy-two (1072) patients were randomized: placebo (n=134), febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=267), 
febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=269), febuxostat 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD 
[n=258] for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for 
patients with a baseline serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL and ≤2.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and 
forty mg febuxostat (2 times the recommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation 
dose. 
The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the febuxostat 80 mg QD 
and the febuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of 
allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 
6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) (see Table 2 and Figure 1). 
FACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were 
randomized: febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=256), febuxostat C 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 
300 mg QD (n=253). 
The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both febuxostat 80 mg and 
febuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 
300 mg treatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L).

The ability of febuxostat to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent. Reduction 
in serum uric acid level to <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was 
maintained throughout treatment. The mean serum uric acid levels over time for each treatment 
group from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 1.

Note: 509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine >1.5 and 
≤2.0 mg/dL were dosed with 100 mg QD. (10 patients out of 268 in APEX study). 
240 mg febuxostat was used to evaluate the safety of febuxostat at twice the recommended 
highest dose. 
CONFIRMS Study: The CONFIRMS study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, 26-week 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg, in comparison with 
allopurinol 300 mg or 200 mg, in patients with gout and hyperuricaemia. Two thousand and 
two hundred-sixty nine (2269) patients were randomized: febuxostat 40 mg QD (n=757), 
febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=756), or allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the 
patients had mild-moderate renal impairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). 
Prophylaxis against gout flares was obligatory over the 26-week period. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final 
visit, was 45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 
300/200 mg, respectively. 
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment 
The APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum 
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and ≤2.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized 
to allopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. Febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy 
endpoint in 44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared 
to 0% in the allopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid 
concentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal 
function group and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group). 
An analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the 
CONFIRMS study, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering 
serum urate levels to < 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had 
gout with mild to moderate renal impairment (65% of patients studied).

Primary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA ≥ 10 mg/dL 
Approximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of ≥ 
10 mg/dL. In this subgroup febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 
6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 visits) in 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) 
of patients compared to 9% in the allopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0% in the placebo 
groups. 
In the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint 
(sUA <6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of ≥ 10 mg/dL 
treated with febuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% 
(125/254) and with allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively. 
Clinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare 
APEX study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
febuxostat 120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to 
febuxostat 80 mg (28%), allopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased 
following the prophylaxis period and gradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of 
subjects received treatment for gout flares from Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the 
last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were observed in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% 
(allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects. 
FACT study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
febuxostat 120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both 
the febuxostat 80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week 
prophylaxis period, the incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% 
and 70% of subjects received treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the 
last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) 
and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of subjects. 
The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was 
numerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level 
<6.0 mg/dL, <5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-
baseline serum urate level ≥6.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 
20 - Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 intervals). 
During the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout 
flares (Day 1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol 
groups, respectively. No difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout 
flares was observed between the febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups. 
Long-term, open label extension Studies 
EXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, 
randomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies (APEX or FACT).  A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: Febuxostat 
80 mg QD (n=649), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). 
About 69% of patients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. 
Patients who had 3 consecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn. 
Serum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial 
treatment with febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36). 
Three years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients 
requiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a 
flare) at Month 16-24 and at Month 30-36. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, 
respectively, had complete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final 
Visit. 
FOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension 
study for patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study 
TMX-00-004. 
116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of patients 
required no dose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a dose 
adjustment to achieve a final stable dose. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit 
was greater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose. 
During the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in 
patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on 
allopurinol (4.2%) (see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in 
patients on long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in 
the long term open label extension studies (see section 4.4). 
Post Marketing long term studies 
CARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV 
outcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV 
disease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral 
revascularization procedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular 
disease, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To 
achieve sUA less than 6 mg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg 
(regardless of renal function) and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments 
from 300 to 600 mg in patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 
200 to 400 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of 
non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary 
revascularization. 
The endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-
blind study medication. 
Overall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not 
complete all trial visits. 
In total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of 
exposure was 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol 
group (n 3092). 
The primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol 
treatment groups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided 
repeated 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.21). 
In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with 
febuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates 
of the other MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal 
MI (3.6% vs. 3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of 
patients; HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina 
(1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was 
also higher with febuxostat than allopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-
1.47), which was mainly driven by the higher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4). 
Rates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not 
associated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ischemic attacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol. 
FAST study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint study comparing the 
CV safety profile of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with chronic hyperuricaemia (in 
conditions where urate deposition had already occurred) and CV risk factors (i.e. patients 60 
years or older and with at least one other CV risk factor). Eligible patients received allopurinol 
treatment prior to randomization, and dose adjustments were required when needed, according 
to clinical judgement, EULAR recommendations and the approved posology. At the end of the 
allopurinol lead-in phase, patients with a sUA level of <0.36 mmol/L (<6 mg/dL) or receiving 
the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum licensed dose of allopurinol were randomised in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat or allopurinol treatment. The primary endpoint of the 
study FAST was the time to the first occurrence of any event included in the Antiplatelet 
Trialists’ Collaborative (APTC) composite endpoint, which included: i) hospitalisation for non-
fatal MI/biomarker positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS); ii) non-fatal stroke; iii) death due 
to a CV event. The primary analysis was based on the on-treatment (OT) approach. 
Overall, 6,128 patients were randomized, 3063 to febuxostat and 3065 to allopurinol.  
In the primary OT analysis, febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol in the incidence of the 
primary endpoint, which occurred in 172 patients (1.72/100 patient years) on febuxostat 
compared to 241 patients (2.05/100 patient years) on allopurinol, with an adjusted HR 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.70, 1.03), p<0.001. The OT analysis for the primary endpoint in the subgroup of 
patients with a history of MI, stroke or ACS showed no significant difference between 
treatment groups: there were 65 (9.5%) patients with events in the febuxostat group and 83 
(11.8%) patients with events in the allopurinol group; adjusted HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.42); 
p=0.202. 
Treatment with febuxostat was not associated with an increase in CV death or all-cause death, 
overall or in the subgroup of patients with a baseline history of MI, stroke or ACS. Overall, 
there were fewer deaths in the febuxostat group (62 CV deaths and 108 all-cause deaths), than 
in the allopurinol group (82 CV deaths and 174 all-cause deaths). 
There was a greater reduction in uric acid levels on febuxostat treatment compared to 
allopurinol treatment. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner 
following single and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 
300 mg, a greater than dose proportional increase in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is 
no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. 
Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 
hours. 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with 
hyperuricaemia and gout, treated with febuxostat 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat 
pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained 
from healthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout. 
Absorption 
Febuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or 
multiple oral 80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg/mL, and 5.0-
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3 µg/mL, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not 
been studied. 
Following multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, 
there was a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and an 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, 
respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric 
acid concentration was observed where tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, febuxostat may be 
taken without regard to food. 
Distribution 
The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L 
after oral doses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 
99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 
and 120 mg doses. Plasma protein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 
91%. 
Biotransformation 
Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 
(CYP) system. Four pharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of 
which three occur in plasma of humans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed 
that those oxidative metabolites were formed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or 
CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was formed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9. 
Elimination 
Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 
14C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as 
unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known 
oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In 
addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as 
the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known 
oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). 
Renal impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
renal impairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal 
function. The mean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 
7.5 µg⋅h/mL in the normal renal function group to 13.2 µg.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction 
group. The Cmax and AUC of active metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. 
However, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its 
metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No 
studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Age 
There were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple oral doses of febuxostat in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in 
females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar 
between the genders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum 
human exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with 
febuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less 
of the previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 
4.4 and 4.5). 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility 
In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell 
papilloma and carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose 
group, at approximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any 
other tumour type in either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a 
consequence of species specific purine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance 
to clinical use. 
A standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic 
effects for febuxostat. 
Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and 
reproductive performance of male and female rats. 
There was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to 
febuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning 
index and reduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human 
exposure. Teratology studies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and 
pregnant rabbits at approximately13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic 
effects.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Febuxostat Viatris is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where 
urate deposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty 
arthritis). 
Febuxostat Viatris is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult 
patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). 
Febuxostat Viatris is indicated in adults. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Gout 
The recommended oral dose of Febuxostat Viatris is 80 mg once daily without regard to food. If 
serum uric acid is > 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, Febuxostat Viatris 120 mg once 
daily may be considered. 
Febuxostat Viatris works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 
weeks. The therapeutic target is to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL 
(357 μmol/L). 
Gout flare prophylaxis of at least 6 months is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
The recommended oral dose of Febuxostat Viatris is 120 mg once daily without regard to food. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Febuxostat Viatris should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and 
continued for a minimum of 7 days; however treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days 
according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
The efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, see section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh Class C). 
Gout: The recommended dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 80 mg. Limited 
information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome: in the pivotal Phase III trial (FLORENCE) only subjects with severe 
hepatic insufficiency were excluded from trial participation. No dose adjustment was required 
for enrolled patients on the basis of hepatic function. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and the efficacy of febuxostat in children aged below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Febuxostat Viatris should be taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also 
section 4.8). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardio-vascular disorders 
Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia 
In patients with pre-existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or 
unstable angina), during the development of the product and in one post registrational study 
(CARES), a higher number of fatal cardiovascular events were observed with febuxostat when 
compared to allopurinol. 
However, in a subsequent post registrational study (FAST), febuxostat was not inferior to 
allopurinol in the incidence of both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. 
Treatment of this patient group should be exercised cautiously and they should be monitored 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regularly. 
For further details on cardiovascular safety of febuxostat refer to section 4.8 and section 5.1. 
Prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in patients at risk of TLS 
Patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome treated with febuxostat should be under cardiac monitoring as clinically 
appropriate. 
Medicinal product allergy / hypersensitivity 
Rare reports of serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute anaphylactic reaction/shock, have 
been collected in the post-marketing experience. In most cases, these reactions occurred during 
the first month of therapy with febuxostat. Some, but not all of these patients reported renal 
impairment and/or previous hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, 
including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) were associated 
with fever, haematological, renal or hepatic involvement in some cases. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for symptoms of 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Febuxostat treatment should be immediately 
stopped if serious allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, 
occur since early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If patient has developed 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and acute anaphylactic 
reaction/shock, febuxostat must not be re-started in this patient at any time. 
Acute gouty attacks (gout flare) 
Febuxostat treatment should not be started until an acute attack of gout has completely 
subsided. Gout flares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid 
levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). At 
treatment initiation with febuxostat flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months with an NSAID or 
colchicine is recommended (see section 4.2). 
If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, it should not be discontinued. The gout flare 
should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment 
with febuxostat decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares. 
Xanthine deposition 
In patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g. malignant disease and 
its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in 
rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract. This has not been observed 
in the pivotal clinical study with febuxostat in the Tumor Lysis Syndrome. As there has been no 
experience with febuxostat, its use in patients with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is not 
recommended. 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
Febuxostat use is not recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine as inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause 
increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe 
toxicity. Where the combination cannot be avoided, a reduction of the dose of 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine to the 20% or less of the previously prescribed dose is 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see sections 4.5 and 5.3). 
The patients should be closely monitored and the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should 
be subsequently adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic response and the onset of 
eventual toxic effects. 
Organ transplant recipients 
As there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such 
patients is not recommended (see section 5.1). 
Theophylline 
Co-administration of febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline 400 mg single dose in healthy subjects 
showed absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction (see section 4.5). Febuxostat 80 mg can be 
used in patients concomitantly treated with theophylline without risk of increasing theophylline 
plasma levels. 
No data is available for febuxostat 120 mg. 
Liver disorders 
During the combined phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were 
observed in patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). Liver function test is recommended prior to 
the initiation of therapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgment 
(see section 5.1). 
Thyroid disorders 
Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with 
febuxostat (5.5%) in the long term open label extension studies. Caution is required when 
febuxostat is used in patients with alteration of thyroid function (see section 5.1). 
Excipients 
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicine. 
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Mercaptopurine/azathioprine 
On the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not 
recommended. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of 
these drugs leading to myelotoxicity. In case of concomitant administration with febuxostat, the 
dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to the 20% or less of the previously 
prescribed dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).  
The adequacy of the proposed dose adjustment, which was based on a modelling and simulation 
analysis from preclinical data in rats, was confirmed by the results of a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study in healthy volunteers, receiving azathioprine 100 mg alone and a reduced dose 
of azathioprine (25 mg) in combination with febuxostat (40 or 120 mg). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been 
conducted.  
In the Tumor Lysis Syndrome pivotal trial febuxostat 120 mg daily was administered to patients 
undergoing several chemotherapy regimens, including monoclonal antibodies. However, drug-
drug and drug-disease interactions were not explored during this study. Therefore, possible 
interactions with any concomitantly administered cytotoxic drug cannot be ruled out. 
Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
coadministration of 120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of rosiglitazone had no 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosiglitazone, 
indicating that febuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor in vivo. Thus, co-administration of 
febuxostat with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose 
adjustment for those compounds. 
Theophylline 
An interaction study in healthy subjects has been performed with febuxostat to evaluate whether 
the inhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline circulating levels as reported 
with other XO inhibitors. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of 
febuxostat 80 mg QD with theophylline 400 mg single dose has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics or safety of theophylline. Therefore no special caution is advised when 
febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given concomitantly. No data is available for febuxostat 
120 mg. 
Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation 
Febuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. 
Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in 
theory affect the elimination of febuxostat. In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat 
and naproxen 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 
28%, AUC 41% and t1/2 26%). In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/Cox-2 
inhibitors was not related to any clinically significant increase in adverse events. 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or 
naproxen being necessary. 
Inducers of glucuronidation 
Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased 
efficacy of febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after 
start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment 
of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of febuxostat. 
Colchicine/indometacin/hydrochlorothiazide/warfarin 
Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of 
febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when administered with hydrochlorothiazide. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when administered with febuxostat. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy subjects. INR and Factor VII activity were also not 
affected by the co-administration of febuxostat. 
Desipramine/CYP2D6 substrates 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, 
120 mg febuxostat QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 
substrate indicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in 
vivo. Thus, co-administration of febuxostat with other CYP2D6 substrates is not expected to 
require any dose adjustment for those compounds. 
Antacids 
Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium 
hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to 
cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, 
febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of 
febuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new born child. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal 
development or parturition (see section 5.3). The potential risk for human is unknown. 
Febuxostat should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether febuxostat is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown 
excretion of this active substance in breast milk and an impaired development of suckling pups. 
A risk to a suckling infant cannot be excluded. Febuxostat should not be used while breast-
feeding. 
Fertility 
In animals, reproduction studies up to 48 mg/kg/day showed no dose-dependent adverse effects 
on fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of febuxostat on human fertility is unknown. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Somnolence, dizziness, paraesthesia and blurred vision have been reported with the use of 
febuxostat. Patients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in 
dangerous activities until they are reasonably certain that febuxostat does not adversely affect 
performance. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (4,072 subjects treated at least 
with a dose from 10 mg to 300 mg), post-authorisation safety studies (FAST study: 3001

gout patients are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, dysponea, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, oedema and fatigue. 
These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity 
reactions to febuxostat, some of which were associated to systemic symptoms and rare events of 
sudden cardiac death, have occurred in the post-marketing experience. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) 
adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with febuxostat are listed below. 
The frequencies are based on studies and post-marketing experience in gout patients. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Adverse reactions coming from post-authorisation safety studies 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, 
Toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have occurred in the post-
marketing experience. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis are 
characterised by progressive skin rashes associated with blisters or mucosal lesions and eye 
irritation. Hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat can be associated to the following symptoms: 
skin reactions characterised by infiltrated maculopapular eruption, generalised or exfoliative 
rashes, but also skin lesions, facial oedema, fever, haematologic abnormalities such as 
thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia, and single or multiple organ involvement (liver and kidney 
including tubulointerstitial nephritis) (see section 4.4). 
Gout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first 
months. Thereafter, the frequency of gout flare decreases in a time-dependent manner. Gout 
flare prophylaxis is recommended (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 pivotal FLORENCE (FLO-01) study comparing 
febuxostat with allopurinol (346 patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic 
malignancies and at intermediate-to-high risk of TLS), only 22 (6.4%) patients overall 
experienced adverse reactions, namely 11 (6.4%) patients in each treatment group. The majority 
of adverse reactions were either mild or moderate. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety concern in addition to the 
previous experience with febuxostat in gout, with the exception of the following three adverse 
reactions (listed above in table 1). 
Cardiac disorders: 
Uncommon: Left bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia 
Vascular disorders:  
Uncommon: haemorrhage 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
Patients with an overdose should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparation, preparations inhibiting uric acid production, 
ATC code: M04AA03 
Mechanism of action 
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of 
hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by 
xanthine oxidase (XO). Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic 
effect of decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting XO. Febuxostat is a potent, non-
purine selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one 
nanomolar. Febuxostat has been shown to potently inhibit both the oxidized and reduced forms 
of XO. At therapeutic concentrations febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in 
purine or pyrimidine metabolism, namely, guanine deaminase, hypoxanthine guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine monophosphate 
decarboxylase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Gout 
The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three Phase 3 pivotal studies (the two pivotal 
APEX and FACT studies, and the additional CONFIRMS study, described below) that were 
conducted in 4101 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. In each phase 3 pivotal study, 
febuxostat demonstrated superior ability to lower and maintain serum uric acid levels compared 
to allopurinol. The primary efficacy endpoint in the APEX and FACT studies was the 
proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly serum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/dL 
(357 µmol/L). In the additional phase 3 CONFIRMS study, for which results became available 
after the marketing authorisation for febuxostat was first issued, the primary efficacy endpoint 
was the proportion of patients whose serum urate level was < 6.0 mg/dL at the final visit. No 
patients with organ transplant have been included in these studies (see section 4.2). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
APEX Study: The Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) 
was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 28-week study. One thousand and 
seventy-two (1072) patients were randomized: placebo (n=134), febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=267), 
febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=269), febuxostat 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD 
[n=258] for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg QD [n=10] for 
patients with a baseline serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL and ≤2.0 mg/dL). Two hundred and 
forty mg febuxostat (2 times the recommended highest dose) was used as a safety evaluation 
dose. 
The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the febuxostat 80 mg QD 
and the febuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used doses of 
allopurinol 300 mg (n=258) /100 mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 
6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) (see Table 2 and Figure 1). 
FACT Study: The Febuxostat Allopurinol Controlled Trial (FACT) Study was a Phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 52-week study. Seven hundred sixty (760) patients were 
randomized: febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=256), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=251), or allopurinol 
300 mg QD (n=253). 
The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both febuxostat 80 mg and 
febuxostat 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 
300 mg treatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/dL (357 µmol/L).

The ability of febuxostat to lower serum uric acid levels was prompt and persistent. Reduction 
in serum uric acid level to <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was 
maintained throughout treatment. The mean serum uric acid levels over time for each treatment 
group from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 1.

Note: 509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine >1.5 and 
≤2.0 mg/dL were dosed with 100 mg QD. (10 patients out of 268 in APEX study). 
240 mg febuxostat was used to evaluate the safety of febuxostat at twice the recommended 
highest dose. 
CONFIRMS Study: The CONFIRMS study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, 26-week 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg, in comparison with 
allopurinol 300 mg or 200 mg, in patients with gout and hyperuricaemia. Two thousand and 
two hundred-sixty nine (2269) patients were randomized: febuxostat 40 mg QD (n=757), 
febuxostat 80 mg QD (n=756), or allopurinol 300/200 mg QD (n=756). At least 65% of the 
patients had mild-moderate renal impairment (with creatinine clearance of 30-89 mL/min). 
Prophylaxis against gout flares was obligatory over the 26-week period. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of < 6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final 
visit, was 45% for 40 mg febuxostat, 67% for febuxostat 80 mg and 42% for allopurinol 
300/200 mg, respectively. 
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment 
The APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i.e., baseline serum 
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and ≤2.0 mg/dL). For renally impaired subjects who were randomized 
to allopurinol, the dose was capped at 100 mg QD. Febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy 
endpoint in 44% (80 mg QD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared 
to 0% in the allopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid 
concentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal 
function group and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group). 
An analysis in patients with gout and renal impairment was prospectively defined in the 
CONFIRMS study, and showed that febuxostat was significantly more efficacious in lowering 
serum urate levels to < 6 mg/dL compared to allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg in patients who had 
gout with mild to moderate renal impairment (65% of patients studied).

Primary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA ≥ 10 mg/dL 
Approximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of ≥ 
10 mg/dL. In this subgroup febuxostat achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (sUA < 
6.0 mg/dL at the last 3 visits) in 41% (80 mg QD), 48% (120 mg QD), and 66% (240 mg QD) 
of patients compared to 9% in the allopurinol 300 mg/100 mg QD and 0% in the placebo 
groups. 
In the CONFIRMS study, the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint 
(sUA <6.0 mg/dL at the final visit) for patients with a baseline serum urate level of ≥ 10 mg/dL 
treated with febuxostat 40 mg QD was 27% (66/249), with febuxostat 80 mg QD 49% 
(125/254) and with allopurinol 300 mg/200 mg QD 31% (72/230), respectively. 
Clinical Outcomes: proportion of patients requiring treatment for a gout flare 
Apex study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
febuxostat 120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for gout flare compared to 
febuxostat 80 mg (28%), allopurinol 300 mg (23%) and placebo (20%). Flares increased 
following the prophylaxis period and gradually decreased over time. Between 46% and 55% of 
subjects received treatment for gout flares from Week 8 and Week 28. Gout flares during the 
last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 24-28) were observed in 15% (febuxostat 80, 120 mg), 14% 
(allopurinol 300 mg) and 20% (placebo) of subjects. 
Fact study: During the 8-week prophylaxis period, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
febuxostat 120 mg (36%) treatment group required treatment for a gout flare compared to both 
the febuxostat 80 mg (22%) and allopurinol 300 mg (21%) treatment groups. After the 8-week 
prophylaxis period, the incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time (64% 
and 70% of subjects received treatment for gout flares from Week 8-52). Gout flares during the 
last 4 weeks of the study (Weeks 49-52) were observed in 6-8% (febuxostat 80 mg, 120 mg) 
and 11% (allopurinol 300 mg) of subjects. 
The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare (APEX and FACT Study) was 
numerically lower in the groups that achieved an average post-baseline serum urate level 
<6.0 mg/dL, <5.0 mg/dL, or <4.0 mg/dL compared to the group that achieved an average post-
baseline serum urate level ≥6.0 mg/dL during the last 32 weeks of the treatment period (Week 
20-Week 24 to Week 49 - 52 intervals). 
During the CONFIRMS study, the percentages of patients who required treatment for gout 
flares (Day 1 through Month 6) were 31% and 25% for the febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol 
groups, respectively. No difference in the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout 
flares was observed between the febuxostat 80 mg and 40 mg groups. 
Long-term, open label extension Studies 
EXCEL Study (C02-021): The Excel study was a three years Phase 3, open label, multicenter, 
randomised, allopurinol-controlled, safety extension study for patients who had completed the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies (APEX or FACT). A total of 1,086 patients were enrolled: Febuxostat 
80 mg QD (n=649), febuxostat 120 mg QD (n=292) and allopurinol 300/100 mg QD (n=145). 
About 69% of patients required no treatment change to achieve a final stable treatment. 
Patients who had 3 consecutive sUA levels >6.0 mg/dL were withdrawn. 
Serum urate levels were maintained over time (i.e. 91% and 93% of patients on initial 
treatment with febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg, respectively, had sUA <6 mg/dL at Month 36). 
Three years data showed a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 4% of patients 
requiring treatment for a flare (i.e. more than 96% of patients did not require treatment for a 
flare) at Month 16-24 and at Month 30-36. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
46% and 38%, of patients on final stable treatment of febuxostat 80 or 120 mg QD, 
respectively, had complete resolution of the primary palpable tophus from baseline to the Final 
Visit. 
FOCUS Study (TMX-01-005) was a 5 years Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, safety extension 
study for patients who had completed the febuxostat 4 weeks of double blind dosing in study 
TMX-00-004. 116 patients were enrolled and received initially febuxostat 80 mg QD. 62% of 
patients required no dose adjustment to maintain sUA <6 mg/dL and 38% of patients required a 
dose adjustment to achieve a final stable dose. 
The proportion of patients with serum urate levels of <6.0 mg/dL (357 µmol/L) at the final visit 
was greater than 80% (81-100%) at each febuxostat dose. 
During the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in 
patients treated with febuxostat (5.0%). These rates were similar to the rates reported on 
allopurinol (4.2%) (see section 4.4). Increased TSH values (>5.5 µIU/mL) were observed in 
patients on long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.5%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in 
the long term open label extension studies (see section 4.4). 
Post Marketing long term studies 
CARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non inferiority trial comparing CV 
outcomes with febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of major CV 
disease including MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization 
procedure, stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes 
mellitus with evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA less than 6 
mg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal function) 
and the dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 300 to 600 mg in patients 
with normal renal function and mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in patients with 
moderate renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first occurrence of MACE, a composite of non-
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. 
The endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis including all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-
blind study medication. 
Overall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment prematurely and 45% of patients did not 
complete all trial visits. 
In total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 months and the median duration of 
exposure was 728 days for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in allopurinol 
group (n 3092). 
The primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the febuxostat and allopurinol 
treatment groups (10.8% vs. 10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; two-sided 
repeated 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.21). 
In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the rate of CV deaths was higher with 
febuxostat than allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The rates 
of the other MACE events were similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-fatal 
MI (3.6% vs. 3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of 
patients; HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization due to unstable angina (1.6% 
vs. 1.8% of patients; HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality was also 
higher with febuxostat than allopurinol (7.8% vs. 6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), 
which was mainly driven by the higher rate of CV deaths in that group (see section 4.4). 
Rates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, hospital admissions for arrhythmias not 
associated with ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and hospitalization for transient 
ischemic attacks were comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FAST study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint study comparing the 
CV safety profile of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with chronic hyperuricaemia (in 
conditions where urate deposition had already occurred) and CV risk factors (i.e. patients 60 
years or older and with at least one other CV risk factor). Eligible patients received allopurinol 
treatment prior to randomization, and dose adjustments were required when needed, according 
to clinical judgement, EULAR recommendations and the approved posology. At the end of the 
allopurinol lead-in phase, patients with a sUA level of <0.36 mmol/L (<6 mg/dL) or receiving 
the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum licensed dose of allopurinol were randomised in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat or allopurinol treatment. The primary endpoint of the study 
FAST was the time to the first occurrence of any event included in the Antiplatelet Trialists’ 
Collaborative (APTC) composite endpoint, which included: i) hospitalisation for non-fatal 
MI/biomarker positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS); ii) non-fatal stroke; iii) death due to a 
CV event. The primary analysis was based on the on-treatment (OT) approach. 
Overall, 6,128 patients were randomized, 3063 to febuxostat and 3065 to allopurinol.  
In the primary OT analysis, febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol in the incidence of the 
primary endpoint, which occurred in 172 patients (1.72/100 patient years) on febuxostat 
compared to 241 patients (2.05/100 patient years) on allopurinol, with an adjusted HR 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.70, 1.03), p<0.001. The OT analysis for the primary endpoint in the subgroup of 
patients with a history of MI, stroke or ACS showed no significant difference between treatment 
groups: there were 65 (9.5%) patients with events in the febuxostat group and 83 (11.8%) 
patients with events in the allopurinol group; adjusted HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.42); p=0.202. 
Treatment with febuxostat was not associated with an increase in CV death or all-cause death, 
overall or in the subgroup of patients with a baseline history of MI, stroke or ACS. Overall, 
there were fewer deaths in the febuxostat group (62 CV deaths and 108 all-cause deaths), than in 
the allopurinol group (82 CV deaths and 174 all-cause deaths). 
There was a greater reduction in uric acid levels on febuxostat treatment compared to allopurinol 
treatment. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
The efficacy and safety of febuxostat in the prevention and treatment of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome was evaluated in the FLORENCE (FLO-01) study. Febuxostat C showed a superior 
and faster urate lowering activity compared to allopurinol. 
FLORENCE was a randomized (1:1), double blind, phase III, pivotal trial comparing 
febuxostat 120 mg once daily with allopurinol 200 to 600 mg daily (mean allopurinol daily 
dose [± standard deviation]: 349.7 ± 112.90 mg) in terms of control of serum uric acid level. 
Eligible patients had to be candidates for allopurinol treatment or have no access to rasburicase. 
Primary endpoints were serum uric acid area under the curve (AUC sUA1-8) and change in 
serum creatinine (sC) level both from baseline to Day 8. 
Overall, 346 patients with haematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and at 
intermediate/high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome were included. Mean AUC sUA1-8 (mgxh/dl) 
was significantly lower with febuxostat (514.0 ± 225.71 vs 708.0 ± 234.42; least square means 
difference: -196.794 [95% confidence interval: -238.600 ; -154.988]; p < .0001). Furthermore, 
the mean serum uric acid level was significantly lower with febuxostat since the first 24 hours 
of treatment and at any following time point. No significant difference in mean serum 
creatinine change (%) occurred between febuxostat and allopurinol (-0.83 ± 26.98 vs -4.92 ± 
16.70 respectively; least square means difference: 4.0970 [95% confidence interval: -0.6467 ; 
8.8406]; p=0.0903). With regard to secondary endpoints, no significant difference was detected 
in terms of incidence of laboratory TLS (8.1% and 9.2% in febuxostat and allopurinol arm, 
respectively; relative risk: 0.875 [95% confidence interval: 0.4408 ; 1.7369]; p=0.8488) nor of 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical TLS (1.7% and 1.2% in febuxostat and allopurinol arm, respectively; relative risk: 
0.994 [95% confidence interval: 0.9691 ; 1.0199]; p=1.0000).  Incidence of overall treatment-
emergent signs and symptoms and adverse drug reactions was 67.6% vs 64.7% and 6.4% vs 
6.4% with febuxostat and allopurinol respectively. In the FLORENCE study febuxostat 
demonstrated a superior control of serum uric acid level compared to allopurinol in patients 
scheduled to receive the latter drug. No data comparing febuxostat with rasburicase are 
currently available. The efficacy and safety of febuxostat has not been established in patients 
with acute severe TLS, e.g. in patients who failed on other urate lowering therapies. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner 
following single and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg. For doses between 120 mg and 
300 mg, a greater than dose proportional increase in AUC is observed for febuxostat. There is 
no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 240 mg are administered every 24 hours. 
Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 5 to 8 
hours. 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted in 211 patients with 
hyperuricaemia and gout, treated with febuxostat 40-240 mg QD. In general, febuxostat 
pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by these analyses are consistent with those obtained 
from healthy subjects, indicating that healthy subjects are representative for 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment in the patient population with gout. 
Absorption 
Febuxostat is rapidly (tmax of 1.0-1.5 h) and well absorbed (at least 84%). After single or 
multiple oral 80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg/mL, and 5.0-
5.3 µg/mL, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet formulation has not 
been studied. 
Following multiple oral 80 mg once daily doses or a single 120 mg dose with a high fat meal, 
there was a 49% and 38% decrease in Cmax and a 18% and 16% decrease in AUC, respectively. 
However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid 
concentration was observed where tested (80 mg multiple dose). Thus, febuxostat may be taken 
without regard to food. 
Distribution 
The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 L 
after oral doses of 10-300 mg. The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 
99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 
and 120 mg doses. Plasma protein binding of the active metabolites ranges from about 82% to 
91%. 
Biotransformation 
Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) enzyme system and oxidation via the cytochrome P450 
(CYP) system. Four pharmacologically active hydroxyl metabolites have been identified, of 
which three occur in plasma of humans. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed 
that those oxidative metabolites were formed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or 
CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was formed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 
14C- labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as 
unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known 
oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In 
addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as 
the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known 
oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). 
Renal impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
renal impairment, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal 
function. The mean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 
7.5 µg⋅h/mL in the normal renal function group to 13.2 µg.h/mL in the severe renal dysfunction 
group. The Cmax and AUC of active metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. 
However, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of 80 mg of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its 
metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No 
studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Age 
There were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following 
multiple oral doses of febuxostat in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC were 24% and 12% higher in 
females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar 
between the genders. No dose adjustment is needed based on gender. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum 
human exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation of rat data suggests that, when co-administered with 
febuxostat, the clinical dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to 20% or less 
of the previously prescribed dose in order to avoid possible haematological effects (see section 
4.4 and 4.5). 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility 
In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell 
papilloma and carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose 
group, at approximately 11 times human exposure. There was no significant increase in any 
other tumour type in either male or female mice or rats. These findings are considered a 
consequence of species specific purine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance 
to clinical use. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A standard battery of test for genotoxicity did not reveal any biologically relevant genotoxic 
effects for febuxostat. 
Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and 
reproductive performance of male and female rats. 
There was no evidence of impaired fertility, teratogenic effects, or harm to the foetus due to 
febuxostat. There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning 
index and reduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human 
exposure. Teratology studies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and 
pregnant rabbits at approximately 13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic 
effects.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm 
them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Febuxostat Viatris is and what it is used for 
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, 
which is associated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. In some 
people, the amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain 
soluble. When this happens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. These 
crystals can cause sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout 
attack). Left untreated, larger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. These tophi 
may cause joint and bone damage. 
Febuxostat Viatris works by reducing uric acid levels. Keeping uric acid levels low by taking 
Febuxostat Viatris once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces 
symptoms. Keeping uric acid levels sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink 
tophi. 
Febuxostat Viatris 120 mg tablets are also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric 
acid that may occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers. 
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the 
blood accordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented. 
Febuxostat Viatris is for adults. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Febuxostat Viatris  
Do not take Febuxostat Viatris 
• 
If you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Febuxostat Viatris: 
• 
• 
If you have or have had heart failure, heart problems or stroke 
If you have or have had renal disease and/or serious allergic reaction to allopurinol (a 
medication used for the treatment of Gout) 
If you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities 
If you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a 
rare inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood) 
If you have thyroid problems. 
• 
• 
• 
Should you experience allergic reactions to Febuxostat Viatris, stop taking this medicine (see 
also section 4). Possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy, exfoliative rash), itchiness 
swelling of limbs or face 
difficulties in breathing 
fever with enlarged lymph nodes 
but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest. 
Your doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with Febuxostat Viatris. 
There have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome) with the use of febuxostat, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular 
patches often with central blister on the trunk. It may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, 
nose, genitals and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). The rash may progress to widespread 
blistering or peeling of the skin. 
If you have developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be 
re-started on Febuxostat Viatris at any time. If you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek 
immediate advice from a doctor and tell them that you are taking this medicine. 
If you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, 
redness, warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside first before starting 
treatment with Febuxostat Viatris. 
For some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric 
acid levels. Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking 
Febuxostat Viatris, and especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. It is important 
to keep taking Febuxostat Viatris even if you have a flare, as Febuxostat Viatris is still working 
to lower uric acid. Over time, gout flares will occur less often and be less painful if you keep 
taking Febuxostat Viatris every day. 
Your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the 
symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint). 
In patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment 
with uric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, 
with possible stones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with 
febuxostat for Tumor Lysis Syndrome. 
Your doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have 
not been established. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Febuxostat Viatris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines 
containing any of the following substances as they may interact with Febuxostat Viatris and 
your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures: 
• 
• 
• 
Mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer) 
Azathioprine (used to reduce immune response) 
Theophylline (used to treat asthma) 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is not known if febuxostat may harm your unborn child. Febuxostat Viatris should not be used 
during pregnancy. It is not known if febuxostat may pass into human breast milk. You should 
not use Febuxostat Viatris if you are breast-feeding, or if you are planning to breast-feed. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Be aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or 
tingling sensation during treatment and should not drive or operate machines if affected. 
Febuxostat Viatris contains lactose  
Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor 
that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
Febuxostat Viatris contains sodium 
Febuxostat Viatris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

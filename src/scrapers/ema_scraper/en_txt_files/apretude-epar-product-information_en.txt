4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to 
reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, weighing at 
least 35 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Apretude should be prescribed by a healthcare professional experienced in the management of HIV 
PrEP. 
Each injection should be administered by a healthcare professional. 
Individuals must be tested for HIV-1 prior to initiating cabotegravir and at each subsequent injection 
of cabotegravir (see section 4.3). A combined antigen/antibody test as well as an HIV-RNA-based test 
should both be negative. Prescribers are advised to perform both tests, even if the result of the HIV-
RNA-based test will become available after cabotegravir injection. If a combined testing strategy 
including both tests is not available, testing should follow local guidelines. 
Prior to starting Apretude, individuals should be carefully selected to agree to the required dosing 
schedule and counselled about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help reduce 
the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. 
The healthcare provider and individual may decide to use cabotegravir tablets as an oral lead-in prior 
to the initiation of Apretude injection to assess tolerability or may proceed directly to Apretude 
injections (see Table 1 and Table 2 for dosing recommendations). 
Posology

Injection 
Initiation injections 
The recommended initial dose is a single 600 mg intramuscular injection. If oral lead-in has been used, 
the first injection should be planned for the last day of oral lead-in or within 3 days thereafter.  
One month later, a second 600 mg intramuscular injection should be administered. Individuals may be 
given the second 600 mg initiation injection up to 7 days before or after the scheduled dosing date. 
Continuation injections – 2 months apart  
After the second initiation injection, the recommended continuation injection dose in adults is a single 
600 mg intramuscular injection administered every 2 months. Individuals may be given injections up 
to 7 days before or after the date of the scheduled injection date.

   600 mg  
Missed doses 
Individuals who miss a scheduled injection visit should be reassessed to ensure resumption of PrEP 
remains appropriate. 
If a delay of more than 7 days from a scheduled injection date cannot be avoided it will be a missed 
dose, therefore, cabotegravir 30 mg tablets may be used once daily, for a duration of up to two months, 
to replace one scheduled injection visit. The first dose of oral therapy should be taken approximately 
two months (+/- 7 days) after the last injection of cabotegravir. For oral PrEP durations greater than two 
months, an alternative PrEP regimen is recommended. 
Injection dosing should be resumed on the day oral dosing completes or within 3 days, thereafter, as 
recommended in Table 2.

Recommendation 
Missed Doses 
If second injection is missed and 
time since first injection is:  
≤ 2 months 
> 2 months 
Administer one 600 mg injection as soon as possible and continue 
with the every 2 month injection dosing schedule. 
Restart the individual on one 600 mg initiation injection, followed 
by a second 600 mg initiation injection one month later. Then 
follow the every two month injection dosing schedule.

If 3rd or subsequent injection is 
missed and time since prior 
injection is: 
≤ 3 months 
> 3 months 
Special populations  
Administer one 600 mg injection as soon as possible and continue 
with the every 2 month injection dosing schedule. 
Restart the individual on one 600 mg initiation injection, followed 
by a second 600 mg initiation injection one month later. Then 
follow the every two month injection dosing schedule. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals. There are limited data available on the use of 
cabotegravir in individuals aged 65 years and over (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in individuals with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score A or B). Cabotegravir has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh score C, [see section 5.2]). If administered in an individual with severe hepatic impairment, 
cabotegravir should be used with caution. 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in individuals with mild to severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min and not on dialysis [see section 5.2]). Cabotegravir has not been studied in 
individuals with end-stage renal disease on renal replacement therapy. As cabotegravir is greater than 
99% protein bound, dialysis is not expected to alter exposures of cabotegravir. If administered in an 
individual on renal replacement therapy, cabotegravir should be used with caution. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cabotegravir in children and adolescents weighing less than 35 kg have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For intramuscular use. Injections must be administered to the ventrogluteal (recommended as it is 
located away from major nerves and blood vessels) or the dorsogluteal sites.  
Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. 
Once the suspension has been drawn into the syringe, the injection should be administered as soon as 
possible, but may remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours. If the medicinal product remains in the 
syringe for more than 2 hours, the filled syringe and needle must be discarded. 
When administering Apretude injection, healthcare professionals should take into consideration the 
Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual to ensure that the needle length is sufficient to reach the 
gluteus muscle. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Individuals with an unknown or positive HIV-1 status (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Concomitant use with rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin or 
phenobarbital (see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy 
Apretude may not always be effective in preventing HIV-1 infection (see section 5.1). Cabotegravir 
concentrations associated with significant antiviral activity (> 4x Protein Adjusted-Inhibitory 
Concentration, PA-IC90, see section 5.2) are achieved and maintained within hours after initiation of 
oral lead-in and within 7 days from the first injection (without oral lead-in). The exact time from 
initiation of Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV-1 infection is unknown. 
Apretude should be used for PrEP as part of an overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy including 
the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (e.g. knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other 
sexually transmitted infections, condom use). 
Apretude should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in individuals confirmed to be 
HIV negative (see section 4.3). Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV negative at each 
subsequent injection of Apretude. A combined antigen/antibody test as well as an HIV-RNA-based 
test should both be negative. Prescribers are advised to perform both tests, even if the result of the 
HIV-RNA-based test will become available after cabotegravir injection. If a combined testing strategy 
including both tests is not available, testing should follow local guidelines while taking Apretude. 
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures 
to HIV-1 are suspected, HIV-1 status should be reconfirmed.  
Potential risk of resistance 
There is a potential risk of developing resistance to cabotegravir if an individual acquires HIV-1 either 
before or while taking Apretude, or following discontinuation of Apretude (see Long- acting 
properties of Apretude injection). To minimise this risk, it is essential to confirm HIV-1 negative 
status at each subsequent injection of Apretude. A combined antigen/antibody test as well as an HIV-
RNA-based test should both be negative. Prescribers are advised to perform both tests, even if the 
result of the HIV-RNA-based test will become available after cabotegravir injection. If a combined 
testing strategy including both tests is not available, testing should follow local guidelines. 
Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV-1 should immediately begin anti-retroviral therapy (ART). 
Apretude alone does not constitute a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-1 
resistance mutations have emerged in some individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who were 
only taking Apretude. 
Importance of adherence 
Individuals should be counselled periodically to strictly adhere to the recommended oral lead-in and 
injection dosing schedule in order to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection and the potential development 
of resistance. 
Long-acting properties of Apretude injection 
Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of individuals for 
prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer), therefore, the prolonged release characteristics of 
Apretude injection should be taken into consideration when the medicinal product is discontinued and 
alternative not long-acting forms of PrEP are taken, as long as or at any time the risk of acquiring HIV 
is present in the months after discontinuation of Apretude (see section 5.2). 
Healthcare professionals should discuss the benefit-risk of using Apretude with individuals of 
childbearing potential or during pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with integrase inhibitors including 
cabotegravir. These reactions were characterised by rash, constitutional findings and sometimes organ 
dysfunction, including liver injury. Apretude and other suspected medicinal products should be 
discontinued immediately, should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop (including, but not 
limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, 
blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia or angioedema). Clinical 
status, including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated (see 
sections 4.2, Long-acting properties of Apretude injection and 4.8). 
Hepatoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of individuals receiving cabotegravir with or 
without known pre-existing hepatic disease (see section 4.8). Administration of cabotegravir oral lead-
in was used in clinical studies to help identify individuals who may be at risk of hepatotoxicity. 
Clinical and laboratory monitoring are recommended and Apretude should be discontinued if 
hepatotoxicity is confirmed, and individuals managed as clinically indicated (see Long-acting 
properties of Apretude injection). 
Adolescents 
Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with cabotegravir, particularly in those with 
pre-existing psychiatric illness (see section 4.8). Although clinical studies did not show an increased 
incidence of psychiatric illness in adolescents compared to adult subjects, given the vulnerability of 
the adolescent population, adolescents should be counselled before prescribing, and periodically while 
receiving Apretude, and managed as clinically indicated. 
Interactions with medicinal products 
Caution should be given to prescribing Apretude injection with medicinal products that may reduce its 
exposure (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir 
Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 
and to a lesser extent by UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 
UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy (see 
section 4.3 and Table 3 below).  In poor metabolisers of UGT1A1, representing a maximum clinical 
UGT1A1 inhibition, the mean AUC, Cmax and Ctau of oral cabotegravir increased by up to 1.5-fold. No 
dosing adjustments for Apretude are recommended in the presence of UGT1A1 inhibitors. 
Cabotegravir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
however, because of its high permeability, no alteration in absorption is expected when co-
administered with either P-gp or BCRP inhibitors. 
Effect of cabotegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
In vivo, cabotegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 probe. In 
vitro, cabotegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro cabotegravir inhibited organic anion transporters (OAT) 1 (IC50=0.81 µM) and OAT3 
(IC50=0.41 µM). Therefore, caution is advised when co-dosing with narrow therapeutic index OAT1/3 
substrate medicinal products (e.g. methotrexate). 
Based on the in vitro and clinical drug interaction profile, cabotegravir is not expected to alter 
concentrations of other anti-retroviral medicinal products including protease inhibitors, nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, 
entry inhibitors, and ibalizumab. 
No drug interaction studies have been performed with cabotegravir injection. The drug interaction data 
provided in Table 3 is obtained from studies with oral cabotegravir (increase is indicated as “↑”, 
decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, area under the concentration versus time curve as “AUC”, 
maximum observed concentration as “Cmax”, concentration at end of dosing interval as “Cτ”).

Metabolic inducers may significantly decrease 
cabotegravir plasma concentration. Concomitant 
use is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Rifampicin significantly decreased cabotegravir 
plasma concentration which is likely to result in 
loss of therapeutic effect. Dosing recommendations 
for co-administration of Apretude with rifampicin 
have not been established and co-administration of 
Apretude with rifampicin is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Rifapentine may significantly decrease 
cabotegravir plasma concentrations. Concomitant 
use is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
When rifabutin is started before or concomitantly 
with the first cabotegravir initiation injection the 
recommended cabotegravir dosing schedule is one 
600 mg injection followed 2 weeks later by a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
second 600 mg initiation injection and monthly, 
thereafter, while on rifabutin.   
When rifabutin is started at the time of the second 
initiation injection or later, the recommended 
dosing schedule is 600 mg, monthly, while on 
rifabutin. 
After stopping rifabutin, the recommended 
cabotegravir dosing schedule is 600 mg every 2 
months. 
Cabotegravir did not significantly change ethinyl 
estradiol and levonorgestrel plasma concentrations 
to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment 
of oral contraceptives is necessary when co-
administered with Apretude.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential should be counselled about prolonged release characteristics of 
cabotegravir injection. If a woman plans a pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of starting/continuing 
PrEP with Apretude should be discussed (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of cabotegravir in pregnant women. The effect of cabotegravir on 
pregnancy is unknown. 
Cabotegravir was not teratogenic when studied in pregnant rats and rabbits but exposures higher than 
the therapeutic dose showed reproductive toxicity in animals (see section 5.3). The relevance to human 
pregnancy is unknown. 
Apretude injection is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Cabotegravir has been detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after an injection, 
therefore, consideration should be given to the potential for foetal exposure during pregnancy (see 
section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is expected that cabotegravir will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this 
has not been confirmed in humans. Cabotegravir may be present in human milk for up to 12 months or 
longer after the last Apretude injection. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is recommended that women breast-feed only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
infant. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of cabotegravir on human male or female fertility. Animal studies 
indicate no effects of cabotegravir on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Individuals should be informed that dizziness, somnolence and fatigue have been reported during 
treatment with Apretude injection. The clinical status of the individual and the adverse reaction profile 
of Apretude injection should be borne in mind when considering the individual’s ability to drive or 
operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile

*Please refer to section 4.4 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Local injection site reactions (ISRs) 
In HPTN 083, 2% of participants discontinued cabotegravir because of ISRs. Out of 20286 injections, 
8900 ISRs were reported. A total of 2117 participants received at least one injection. Of the 1740 
(82%) participants who experienced at least one ISR, the maximum severity of ISRs reported was mild 
(Grade 1, 34% of participants), moderate (Grade 2, 46% of participants) or severe (Grade 3, 3% of 
participants). The median duration of overall ISR adverse reactions was 4 days. The proportion of 
participants reporting ISRs at each visit and the severity of the ISRs decreased over time. 
In HPTN 084, no participants discontinued cabotegravir because of ISRs. Out of 13068 injections, 
1171 ISRs were reported. A total of 1519 participants received at least one injection. Of the 578 (38%) 
participants who experienced at last one ISR, the maximum severity of ISRs reported was mild (Grade 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
1, 25% of participants), moderate (Grade 2, 13% of participants) or severe (Grade 3, < 1% of 
participants). The median duration of overall ISR adverse reactions was 8 days. The proportion of 
participants reporting ISRs at each visit and the severity of the ISRs generally decreased over time. 
Weight increased 
At the week 41 and week 97 timepoints in HPTN 083, participants who received cabotegravir gained a 
median of 1.2 kg (Interquartile Range [IQR] -1.0, 3.5; n=1623) and 2.1 kg (IQR; -0.9, 5.9 n=601) in 
weight from baseline, respectively; those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine 
(FTC) group gained a median of 0.0 kg (IQR -2.1, 2.4, n=1611) and 1.0 kg (IQR; -1.9, 4.0 n=598) in 
weight from baseline, respectively. 
At the Week 41 and Week 97 timepoints in HPTN 084, participants who received cabotegravir gained 
a median of 2.0 kg (IQR 0.0, 5.0; n=1151) and 4.0 kg (IQR; 0.0, 8.0, n=216) in weight from baseline, 
respectively; those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) group gained a 
median of 1.0 kg (IQR -1.0, 4.0, n=1131) and 3.0 kg (IQR; -1.0, 6.0 n=218) in weight from baseline, 
respectively. 
Changes in laboratory chemistries 
In both HPTN 083 and HPTN 084, a similar proportion of participants in the cabotegravir and 
TDF/FTC groups were observed to have elevated hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) levels and 
maximum post baseline increases were mostly Grades 1 and 2. In HPTN 083, the number of 
participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who experienced maximum post baseline Grade 3 
or 4 ALT levels were 40 (2%) vs 44 (2%) and Grade 3 or 4 AST levels were 68 (3%) vs 79 (3%), 
respectively. In HPTN 084, the number of participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who 
experienced maximum post baseline Grade 3 or 4 ALT levels were 12 (< 1%) vs 18 (1%) and Grade 3 
and 4 AST levels were 15 (< 1%) vs 14 (< 1%), respectively.  
A few participants in both the cabotegravir and TDF/FTC groups had adverse reactions of AST or 
ALT increased which resulted in discontinuation of study product. In HPTN 083, the number of 
participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who discontinued due to ALT increased were: 29 
(1%) vs 31 (1%) and due to AST increased were 7 (< 1%) vs 8 (< 1%), respectively. In HPTN 084, the 
number of participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who discontinued due to ALT 
increased were 12 (< 1%) vs 15 (< 1%) and there were no discontinuations due to AST increased. 
Adolescents 
Based on data from two open-label multicenter clinical trials in 64 HIV-uninfected, at-risk adolescents 
(below 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 35 kg at enrolment) receiving cabotegravir, no new safety 
issues were identified in adolescents compared with the safety profile established in adults receiving 
cabotegravir for HIV-1 PrEP in studies HPTN 083 and HPTN 084.  
Based on data from the Week 16 analysis of the MOCHA study in 23 HIV-infected adolescents (aged 
at least 12 years and weighing ≥35 kg) receiving background combination anti retroviral therapy, no 
new safety concerns were identified in adolescents with the addition of oral cabotegravir followed by 
injectable cabotegravir (n=8) when compared with the safety profile established with cabotegravir in 
adults (see section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for Apretude overdose. If overdose occurs, the individual should be 
treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.

Cabotegravir is known to be highly protein bound in plasma; therefore, dialysis is unlikely to be 
helpful in removal of medicinal product from the body. Management of overdose with Apretude 
injection should take into consideration the prolonged exposure to the medicinal product following an 
injection (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, integrase inhibitor, ATC code: J05AJ04.  
Mechanism of action 
Cabotegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand 
transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV 
replication cycle. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Antiviral activity in cell culture 
Cabotegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean 
concentration of cabotegravir necessary to reduce viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) values of 
0.22 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 0.74 nM in 293T cells and 0.57 nM in MT-4 
cells. Cabotegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of 24 HIV-1 clinical 
isolates (three in each group of M clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and 3 in group O) with EC50 values 
ranging from 0.02 nM to 1.06 nM for HIV-1. Cabotegravir EC50 values against three HIV-2 clinical 
isolates ranged from 0.10 nM to 0.14 nM.  
Antiviral Activity in combination with other medicinal products 
No medicinal products with inherent anti-HIV activity were antagonistic to cabotegravir’s 
antiretroviral activity (in vitro assessments were conducted in combination with rilpivirine, 
lamivudine, tenofovir and emtricitabine). 
Resistance in vitro 
Isolation from wild-type HIV-1 and activity against resistant strains: Viruses with > 10-fold increase 
in cabotegravir EC50 were not observed during the 112-day passage of strain IIIB. The following 
integrase (IN) mutations emerged after passaging wild type HIV-1 (with T124A polymorphism) in the 
presence of cabotegravir: Q146L (fold-change range 1.3-4.6), S153Y (fold-change range 2.8-8.4), and 
I162M (fold-change = 2.8). As noted above, the detection of T124A is selection of a pre-existing 
minority variant that does not have differential susceptibility to cabotegravir. No amino acid 
substitutions in the integrase region were selected when passaging the wild-type HIV-1 NL-432 in the 
presence of 6.4 nM of cabotegravir through Day 56.  
Among the multiple mutants, the highest fold-change was observed with mutants containing Q148K or 
Q148R. E138K/Q148H resulted in a 0.92-fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir but 
E138K/Q148R resulted in a 12-fold decrease in susceptibility and E138K/Q148K resulted in an 81-
fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir. G140C/Q148R and G140S/Q148R resulted in a 22- and 
12-fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir, respectively. While N155H did not alter 
susceptibility to cabotegravir, N155H/Q148R resulted in a 61-fold decrease in susceptibility to 
cabotegravir. Other multiple mutants, which resulted in a FC between 5 and 10, are: T66K/L74M 
(FC=6.3), G140S/Q148K (FC=5.6), G140S/Q148H (FC=6.1) and E92Q/N155H (FC=5.3).

HPTN 083 
In the primary analysis of the HPTN 083 study, there were 13 incident infections on the cabotegravir 
arm and 39 incident infections on the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) arm. In 
the cabotegravir arm, 5 incident infections occurred when receiving cabotegravir PrEP injections, of 
which 4 participants received on-time injections and 1 participant had one injection off-schedule. Five 
incident infections occurred ≥ 6 months after the last dose of cabotegravir PrEP. Three incident 
infections occurred during the oral lead-in period. 
HIV genotyping and phenotyping were attempted at the first visit where HIV viral load was > 500 
copies/mL. Of the 13 incident infections in the cabotegravir arm, 4 participants had INSTI resistance 
mutations. In the TDF/FTC arm, the 4 participants with NRTI resistance (including 3 who had multi-
class resistance) included 3 with M184V/I and one with K65R. 
None of the 5 participants who were infected after prolonged interruption from cabotegravir 
administration had INSTI resistance mutations. Neither genotype nor phenotype could be generated 
for one of the 5 participants, with just 770 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA. Integrase phenotype could not be 
generated for one of the remaining 4 participants. The remaining 3 participants retained susceptibility 
to all INSTIs. 
Three participants became infected during the oral lead-in phase, prior to receiving cabotegravir 
injections. One participant with undetectable plasma cabotegravir levels had no INSTI resistance 
mutations and was susceptible to all INSTIs. Two participants with detectable plasma cabotegravir 
concentrations had INSTI resistance mutations. The first participant had INSTI resistant mutations 
E138E/K, G140G/S, Q148R and E157Q. Integrase phenotype could not be generated. The second 
participant had INSTI resistance mutations E138A and Q148R. This virus was resistant to 
cabotegravir (fold-change =5.92) but susceptible to dolutegravir (fold-change=1.69). 
Five participants acquired HIV-1, despite on time cabotegravir injections for 4 participants and one 
off-schedule injection for one participant. Two participants had viral loads too low to analyse.  The 
third participant had no INSTI resistance mutations at the first viraemic visit (Week 17) but had 
R263K at 112 and 117 days later. While phenotype could not be determined 112 days later, day 117 
phenotype showed this virus to be susceptible to both cabotegravir (fold-change= 2.32) and 
dolutegravir (fold-change=2.29). The fourth participant had INSTI resistance mutations G140A and 
Q148R. Phenotype showed resistance to cabotegravir (fold-change=13) but susceptibility to 
dolutegravir (fold-change=2.09). The fifth participant had no INSTI resistance mutations.  
In addition to the 13 incident infections, one further participant was HIV-1 infected at enrolment and 
had no INSTI resistance mutations at that time, however, 60 days later, INSTI resistance mutation 
E138K and Q148K were detected. Phenotype could not be generated. 
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was performed to better 
characterise the timing of HIV infections. As a result, one of the 13 incident infections in a participant 
receiving on time cabotegravir injections was determined to be a prevalent infection.

HPTN 084 
In the primary analysis of the HPTN 084 study, there were 4 incident infections on the cabotegravir 
arm and 36 incident infections on the TDF/FTC arm.   
In the cabotegravir arm, 2 incident infections occurred while receiving injections; one participant had 
3 delayed cabotegravir injections and both had been non-adherent to oral cabotegravir.  
Two incident infections occurred after the last dose of oral cabotegravir; both participants were non-
adherent to oral cabotegravir. The first HIV positive visit occurred approx. 11 weeks after enrolment 
for one participant and 57 weeks after enrolment for the other. 
HIV genotyping was attempted at the first visit where HIV viral load was > 500 c/mL (first viraemic 
visit). HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 cabotegravir arm participants. No major 
INSTI resistance mutations were detected. 
HIV genotyping results were available for 33 of the 36 incident infections in the TDF/FTC group. One 
participant had a major NRTI mutation (M184V); this participant also had NNRTI resistance with the 
mutation K103N. Nine other participants had NNRTI resistance (7 had K103N, alone or with E138A 
or P225H; 1 had K101E alone; 1 had E138K alone). 
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was performed to better 
characterise the timing of HIV-1 infections. As a result, 1 of the 4 HIV-1 incident infections in 
participants receiving cabotegravir was determined to be a prevalent infection. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of cabotegravir for PrEP has been evaluated in two randomised (1:1), double blind, 
multi-site, two-arm, controlled studies. The efficacy of cabotegravir was compared with daily oral 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC). 
Participants randomised to receive cabotegravir initiated oral lead-in dosing with one 30 mg 
cabotegravir tablet and a placebo daily, for up to 5 weeks, followed by cabotegravir intramuscular 
(IM) injection (single 600 mg injection, at months 1, 2 and every 2 months thereafter and a daily 
placebo tablet. Participants randomised to receive TDF/FTC initiated oral TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg 
and placebo for up to 5 weeks, followed by oral TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg daily and placebo (IM) 
injection (3 mL, 20% lipid injectable emulsion at months 1, 2 and every 2 months thereafter). 
HPTN 083 
In HPTN 083, a non-inferiority study, 4566 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with 
men, were randomised 1:1 and received either cabotegravir (n=2281) or TDF/FTC (n=2285) as 
blinded study medicinal products up to Week 153.  
At baseline, the median age of participants was 26 years, 12% were transgender women, 72% were 
non-white, 67% were < 30 years and < 1% were over 60 years. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of incident HIV infections among participants randomised to oral 
cabotegravir and cabotegravir injections compared to oral TDF/FTC (corrected for early stopping). 
The primary analysis demonstrated the superiority of cabotegravir compared to TDF/FTC with a 66% 
reduction in the risk of acquiring incident HIV infection, hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.34 (0.18, 0.62); 
further testing revealed one of the infections on cabotegravir to be prevalent then yielding a 69% 
reduction in the risk of incident infection relative to TDF/FTC (see Table 5).

Findings from all subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall protective effect, with a lower 
rate of incident HIV-1 infections observed for participants randomised to the cabotegravir group 
compared with participants randomised to the TDF/FTC group (see Table 6).

cabotegravir (n=1614) or TDF/FTC (n=1610) as blinded study medicinal product up to Week 153. 
At baseline, the median age of participants was 25 years, > 99% were non-white, > 99% were

Apretude injections in children under the age of 12 years, in the prevention of HIV-1 infection.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Cabotegravir pharmacokinetics is similar between healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The 
pharmacokinetic variability of cabotegravir is moderate to high. In HIV-infected subjects participating 
in Phase III studies, between-subject CVb% for Ctau ranged from 39 to 48%. Higher between-subject 
variability ranging from 65 to 76% was observed with single dose administration of long-acting 
cabotegravir injection.

1 Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter values were based on individual post-hoc estimates from population PK 
models for subjects in Phase III treatment studies. 
2  tau is dosing interval: 24 hours for oral administration; 1 month for the initial injection and 2 months for every 
2 months for IM injections of extended-release injectable suspension. 
3  Oral lead-in pharmacokinetic parameter values represent steady-state. 
4  Initial injection Cmax values primarily reflect oral dosing because the initial injection was administered on the 
same day as the last oral dose; however, the AUC(0-tau) and Ctau values reflect the initial injection. When 
administered without oral lead-in to HIV infected recipients (n = 110), the observed cabotegravir geometric 
mean (5th, 95th percentile) Cmax (1 week post-initial injection) was 1.89 mcg/mL (0.438, 5.69) and Ctau was 1.43 
mcg/mL (0.403, 3.90). 
5 Pharmacokinetic parameter values represent steady state. 
Absorption 
Cabotegravir injection exhibits absorption-limited pharmacokinetics because cabotegravir is slowly 
absorbed into the systemic circulation from the gluteal muscle resulting in sustained plasma 
concentrations. Following a single 600 mg intramuscular dose, plasma cabotegravir concentrations are 
detectable on the first day with median cabotegravir concentrations at 4 hours post dose of 0.290 
µg/mL, which is above in-vitro PA-IC90 of 0.166 µg/mL, and reach maximum plasma concentration 
with a median Tmax of 7 days. Target concentrations are achieved following the initial intramuscular 
(IM) injection (see Table 9). Cabotegravir has been detected in plasma up to 52 weeks or longer after 
administration of a single injection. 
Distribution 
Cabotegravir is highly bound (approximately > 99%) to human plasma proteins, based on in vitro data. 
Following administration of oral tablets, the mean apparent oral volume of distribution (Vz/F) in 
plasma was 12.3 L. In humans, the estimate of plasma cabotegravir Vc/F was 5.27 L and Vp/F was 
2.43 L. These volume estimates, along with the assumption of high F, suggest some distribution of 
cabotegravir to the extracellular space. 
Cabotegravir is present in the female and male genital tract, following a single 600 mg IM injection, as 
observed in a study in healthy participants (n=15). Median cabotegravir concentrations at Day 3 (the 
earliest tissue PK sample) were 0.49 µg/mL in cervical tissue, 0.29 µg/mL in cervicovaginal fluid, 
0.37 µg/mL in vaginal tissue, 0.32 µg/mL in rectal tissue, and 0.69 µg/mL in rectal fluid, which are 
above the in vitro PA-IC90. 
In vitro, cabotegravir was not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, 
OATP2B1, OATP1B3 or organic cation transporter (OCT1). 
Biotransformation 
Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by UGT1A1 with a minor UGT1A9 component. Cabotegravir is 
the predominant circulating compound in plasma, representing > 90% of plasma total radiocarbon. 
Following oral administration in humans, cabotegravir is primarily eliminated through metabolism; 
renal elimination of unchanged cabotegravir is low (< 1% of the dose). Forty-seven percent of the total 
oral dose is excreted as unchanged cabotegravir in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to unabsorbed medicinal product or biliary excretion of the glucuronide conjugate, which can be 
further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. Cabotegravir was observed to be 
present in duodenal bile samples. The glucuronide metabolite was also present in some, but not all, of 
the duodenal bile samples. Twenty-seven percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, 
primarily as a glucuronide metabolite (75% of urine radioactivity, 20% of total dose). 
Cabotegravir is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of the following enzymes and transporters: CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, 
UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17, P-gp, BCRP, Bile salt 
export pump (BSEP), OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 
(MATE) 1, MATE 2-K, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4. 
Elimination 
Cabotegravir mean apparent terminal phase half-life is absorption-rate limited and is estimated to be 
5.6 to 11.5 weeks after a single dose IM injection. The significantly longer apparent half-life compared 
to oral reflects elimination from the injection site into the systemic circulation. The apparent CL/F was 
0.151 L/h.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Plasma cabotegravir exposure increases in proportion or slightly less than in proportion to dose 
following single and repeat IM injection of doses ranging from 100 to 800 mg. 
Polymorphisms 
In a meta-analysis of healthy and HIV-infected participant trials, HIV-infected participants with 
UGT1A1 genotypes conferring poor cabotegravir metabolism had a 1.2-fold mean increase in steady-
state cabotegravir AUC, Cmax, and Ctau following long-acting injection administration compared with 
participants with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1. These differences are 
not considered clinically relevant. No dose adjustment is required in individuals with UGT1A1 
polymorphisms. 
Special populations 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure 
of cabotegravir. In addition, no clinically relevant differences in plasma cabotegravir concentrations 
were observed in the HPTN 083 study by gender, including in cisgender men and transgender women 
with or without cross-sex hormone therapy use. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required on the basis 
of gender. 
Race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of 
cabotegravir, therefore no dose adjustment is required on the basis of race. 
Body Mass Index (BMI)  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of BMI on the exposure of 
cabotegravir, therefore no dose adjustment is required on the basis of BMI. 
Adolescents 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant differences in exposure between 
the HIV-1 infected adolescent and HIV-1 infected and uninfected adult participants from the 
cabotegravir development programme, therefore, no dose adjustment is needed for adolescents 
weighing ≥ 35 kg.

Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabotegravir revealed no clinically relevant effect of age on 
cabotegravir exposure. Pharmacokinetic data for cabotegravir in subjects of > 65 years old are limited. 
Renal impairment 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment 
(CrCL < 30 mL/min and not on dialysis) and matching healthy subjects were observed. No dose 
adjustment is necessary for individuals with mild to severe renal impairment (not on dialysis). 
Cabotegravir has not been studied in individuals on dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment and matching healthy subjects were observed. No dose adjustment is necessary for 
individuals with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score A or B). The effect of severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir has not been 
studied. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
Cabotegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian 
cells, and an in vivo rodent micronucleus assay. Cabotegravir was not carcinogenic in long term 
studies in the mouse and rat. 
Reproductive toxicology studies 
No effect on male or female fertility was observed in rats treated with cabotegravir at oral doses up to 
1000 mg/kg/day (> 20 times the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended dose (MRHD) of 
30 mg/day orally). 
In an embryo-foetal development study there were no adverse developmental outcomes following oral 
administration of cabotegravir to pregnant rabbits up to a maternal toxic dose of 2,000 mg/kg/day 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(0.66 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD) or to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 
mg/kg/day (> 30 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD). In rats, alterations in foetal growth 
(decreased body weights) were observed at oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. Studies in pregnant rats 
showed that cabotegravir crosses the placenta and can be detected in foetal tissue. 
In rat pre- and post-natal (PPN) studies cabotegravir reproducibly induced a delayed onset of 
parturition, and an increase in the number of stillbirths and neonatal mortalities at oral dose of 1,000 
mg/kg/day (> 30 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD). At a lower dose of 5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 10 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD) cabotegravir was not associated 
with delayed parturition or neonatal mortality. In rabbit and rat studies there was no effect on survival 
when foetuses were delivered by caesarean section. Given the exposure ratio, the relevance to humans 
is unknown. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
The effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of cabotegravir has been evaluated in repeat 
oral dose toxicity studies in rats (26 weeks) and in monkeys (39 weeks). There were no drug-related 
adverse reactions in rats or monkeys given cabotegravir orally at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day or 
500 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
In a 14 day and 28 day monkey toxicity study, gastro-intestinal (GI) effects (body weight loss, emesis, 
loose/watery faeces, and moderate to severe dehydration) were observed and were the result of local 
medicinal product administration (oral) and not systemic toxicity. 
In a 3 month study in rats, when cabotegravir was administered by monthly sub-cutaneous (SC) 
injection (up to 100 mg/kg/dose); monthly IM injection (up to 75 mg/kg/dose) or weekly SC injection 
(100 mg/kg/dose), there were no adverse reactions noted and no new target organ toxicities (at 
exposures > 49 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD of 600 mg IM dose).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Apretude is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for short term pre-exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in high-risk adults and adolescents, 
weighing at least 35 kg (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). Apretude tablets may be used as:  
•  oral lead-in to assess tolerability of Apretude prior to administration of long acting 
cabotegravir injection. 
•  oral PrEP for individuals who will miss planned dosing with cabotegravir injection. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Apretude should be prescribed by a healthcare professional experienced in the management of HIV 
PrEP. 
Individuals must be tested for HIV-1 prior to initiating cabotegravir (see section 4.3). A combined 
antigen/antibody test as well as an HIV-RNA-based test should both be negative. Prescribers are 
advised to perform both tests, even if the result of the HIV-RNA-based test will become available after 
oral administration. If a combined testing strategy including both tests is not available, testing should 
follow local guidelines.  
Prior to starting Apretude, individuals should be carefully selected to agree to the required dosing 
schedule and counselled about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help reduce 
the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The healthcare provider and individual may decide to use cabotegravir tablets as an oral lead-in prior 
to the initiation of Apretude injection to assess tolerability (see Table 1) or may proceed directly to 
Apretude injections (see Apretude injection SmPC). 
Posology 
Oral lead-in 
When used for oral lead-in, cabotegravir tablets should be taken for approximately one month (at least 
28 days) to assess tolerability to cabotegravir (see section 4.4). One Apretude 30 mg tablet should be 
taken, once daily with or without food. 
Table 1 Recommended dosing schedule  
Oral lead-in 
Medicinal product 
During month 1 
Apretude 
30 mg once daily 
Oral dosing for missed injections of cabotegravir. 
If a delay of more than 7 days from a scheduled injection visit cannot be avoided, Apretude 30 mg 
tablets may be used once daily to replace one scheduled injection visit. The first dose of oral therapy 
should be taken two months (+/- 7 days) after the last injection of cabotegravir. For oral PrEP 
durations greater than two months, an alternative PrEP regimen is recommended. 
Injection dosing should be resumed on the day oral dosing completes or within 3 days, thereafter (see 
Apretude injection SmPC).  
Missed doses 
If the individual misses a dose of Apretude tablets, the individual should take the missed dose as soon 
as possible, providing the next dose is not due within 12 hours. If the next dose is due within 12 hours, 
the individual should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. 
Vomiting 
If an individual vomits within 4 hours of taking Apretude tablets, another Apretude tablet should be 
taken. If an individual vomits more than 4 hours after taking Apretude tablets, the individual does not 
need to take another tablet until the next regularly scheduled dose. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals. There are limited data available on the use of 
cabotegravir in individuals aged 65 years and over (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in individuals with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score A or B). Cabotegravir has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh score C [see section 5.2]). 
If administered in an individual with severe hepatic impairment, cabotegravir should be used with 
caution. 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in individuals with mild to severe renal impairment 
(CrCL < 30 mL/min and not on dialysis [see section 5.2]). Cabotegravir has not been studied in 
individuals with end-stage renal disease on renal replacement therapy. As cabotegravir is greater than 
99% protein bound, dialysis is not expected to alter exposures of cabotegravir. If administered in an 
individual on renal replacement therapy, cabotegravir should be used with caution. 
23 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cabotegravir in children and adolescents weighing less than 35 kg have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Individuals with an unknown or positive HIV-1 status (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Concomitant use with rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin or 
phenobarbital (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy 
Apretude may not always be effective in preventing HIV-1 infection (see section 5.1). Cabotegravir 
concentrations associated with significant antiviral activity (> 4x Protein Adjusted-Inhibitory 
Concentration, PA-IC90, see section 5.2) are achieved and maintained within hours after initiation of 
oral lead-in. The exact time from initiation of Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP to maximal protection against 
HIV-1 infection is unknown.  
Apretude should be used for PrEP as part of an overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy including 
the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (e.g. knowledge of HIV1 status, regular testing for other 
sexually transmitted infections, condom use). 
Apretude should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in individuals confirmed to be 
HIV negative (see section 4.3). Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at frequent 
intervals. A combined antigen/antibody test as well as an HIV-RNA-based test should both be 
negative. Prescribers are advised to perform both tests, even if the result of the HIV-RNA-based test 
will become available after oral administration. If a combined testing strategy including both tests is 
not available, testing should follow local guidelines while taking Apretude. 
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures 
to HIV-1 are suspected, HIV-1 status should be reconfirmed.  
Potential risk of resistance 
There is a potential risk of developing resistance to cabotegravir if an individual acquires HIV-1 either 
before, or while taking or following discontinuation of cabotegravir. To minimise this risk, it is 
essential to confirm HIV-1 negative status at frequent intervals. A combined antigen/antibody test as 
well as an HIV-RNA-based test should both be negative. Prescribers are advised to perform both tests, 
even if the result of the HIV-RNA-based test will become available after oral administration. If a 
combined testing strategy including both tests is not available, testing should follow local guidelines. 
Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV-1 should immediately begin anti-retroviral therapy (ART). 
Apretude alone does not constitute a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-1 
resistance mutations have emerged in some individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who were 
only taking Apretude. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alternative forms of PrEP should be considered following discontinuation of cabotegravir for those 
individuals at continuing risk of HIV acquisition and initiated within 2 months of the final 
cabotegravir injection.  
Importance of adherence 
Individuals should be counselled periodically to strictly adhere to the recommended oral lead-in 
dosing schedule in order to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and the potential development of 
resistance. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with integrase inhibitors including 
cabotegravir. These reactions were characterised by rash, constitutional findings and sometimes organ 
dysfunction, including liver injury. Apretude and other suspected medicinal products should be 
discontinued immediately, should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop (including, but not 
limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, 
blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia or angioedema). Clinical 
status, including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Hepatoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of individuals receiving cabotegravir with or 
without known pre-existing hepatic disease (see section 4.8). Administration of cabotegravir oral lead-
in was used in clinical studies to help identify individuals who may be at risk of hepatotoxicity. 
Clinical and laboratory monitoring are recommended and Apretude tablets should be discontinued if 
hepatotoxicity is confirmed, and individuals managed as clinically indicated. 
Adolescents 
Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with cabotegravir, particularly in those with 
pre-existing psychiatric illness (see section 4.8). Although clinical studies did not show an increased 
incidence of psychiatric illness in adolescents compared to adult subjects, given the vulnerability of 
the adolescent population, adolescents should be counselled before prescribing, and periodically while 
receiving Apretude, and managed as clinically indicated. 
Interactions with medicinal products  
Caution should be given to prescribing Apretude tablets with medicinal products that may reduce its 
exposure (see section 4.5).  
Polyvalent cation containing antacids are recommended to be taken at least 2 hours before and 4 hours 
after taking Apretude tablets (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
Individuals with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effect of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 
and to a lesser extent by UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 
UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy (see 
section 4.3 and table 2 below). In poor metabolizers of UGT1A1, representing a maximum clinical 
UGT1A1 inhibition, the mean AUC, Cmax and Ctau of oral cabotegravir increased by up to 1.5-fold (see 
section 5.2). No dosing adjustments for Apretude are recommended in the presence of UGT1A1 
inhibitors. 
Cabotegravir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
however, because of its high permeability, no alteration in absorption is expected when co-
administered with either P-gp or BCRP inhibitors. 
Effect of cabotegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
In vivo, cabotegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 probe. In 
vitro, cabotegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. 
In vitro, cabotegravir inhibited the organic anion transporters (OAT) 1 (IC50=0.81 µM) and OAT3 
(IC50=0.41 µM). Cabotegravir may increase the AUC of OAT1/3 substrates up to approximately 80% 
therefore caution is advised when co-dosing with narrow therapeutic index OAT1/3 substrate 
medicinal products (e.g. methotrexate). 
Based on the in vitro and clinical drug interaction profile, cabotegravir is not expected to alter 
concentrations of other anti-retroviral medicinal products including protease inhibitors, nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, 
entry inhibitors, and ibalizumab. 
The drug interaction data provided in Table 2 is obtained from studies with oral cabotegravir (increase 
is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, area under the concentration versus time curve 
as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “Cmax”, concentration at end of dosing interval as 
“Cτ”).

Co-administration of antacid supplements has the 
potential to decrease oral cabotegravir absorption 
and has not been studied. 
Antacid products containing polyvalent cations are 
recommended to be administered at least 2 hours 
before or 4 hours after oral Apretude (see section 
4.4). 
Rifampicin significantly decreased cabotegravir 
plasma concentration which is likely to result in 
loss of therapeutic effect. Dosing recommendations 
for co-administration of Apretude with rifampicin 
have not been established and co-administration of 
Apretude with rifampicin is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  
Rifapentine may significantly decrease 
cabotegravir plasma concentrations, concomitant 
use is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Rifabutin did not significantly change cabotegravir 
plasma concentration. No dose adjustment is 
required. 
Cabotegravir did not significantly change ethinyl 
estradiol and levonorgestrel plasma concentrations 
to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment 
of oral contraceptives is necessary when co-
administered with Apretude tablets. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential  
If a woman plans a pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of starting/continuing PrEP with Apretude 
should be discussed. 
Pregnancy 
There are a limited amount of data from the use of cabotegravir in pregnant women. The effect of 
cabotegravir on pregnancy is unknown. 
Cabotegravir was not teratogenic when studied in pregnant rats and rabbits but exposures higher than 
the therapeutic dose showed reproductive toxicity in animals (see section 5.3). The relevance to human 
pregnancy is unknown. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apretude tablets are not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is expected that cabotegravir will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this 
has not been confirmed in humans.  
It is recommended that women breast-feed only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
infant. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of cabotegravir on human male or female fertility. Animal studies 
indicate no effects of cabotegravir on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Individuals should be informed that dizziness, somnolence and fatigue have been reported during 
treatment with Apretude tablets. The clinical status of the individual and the adverse reaction profile of 
Apretude tablets should be borne in mind when considering the individual’s ability to drive or operate 
machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in HPTN 083 were: headache (17%) and diarrhoea 
(14%).  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in HPTN 084 were: headache (23%) and transaminase 
increased (19%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions for cabotegravir were identified from the Phase III clinical studies; HPTN 083 and 
HPTN 084; and post-marketing data. In HPTN 083, the median time on blinded study product was 65 
weeks and 2 days (1 day to 156 weeks and 1 day), with a total exposure on cabotegravir of 3231 
person years. In HPTN 084, the median time on blinded study product was 64 weeks and 1 day (1 day 
to 153 weeks and 1 day), with a total exposure on cabotegravir of 2009 person years.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Weight increased 
At the week 41 and week 97 timepoints in HPTN 083, participants who received cabotegravir gained a 
median of 1.2 kg (Interquartile Range [IQR] -1.0, 3.5; n=1623) and 2.1 kg (IQR; -0.9, 5.9 n=601) in 
weight from baseline, respectively; those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine 
(FTC) group gained a median of 0.0 kg (IQR -2.1, 2.4, n=1611) and 1.0 kg (IQR; -1.9, 4.0 n=598) in 
weight from baseline, respectively. 
At the Week 41 and Week 97 timepoints in HPTN 084, participants who received cabotegravir gained 
a median of 2.0 kg (IQR 0.0, 5.0; n=1151) and 4.0 kg (IQR; 0.0, 8.0, n=216) in weight from baseline, 
respectively; those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) group gained a 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
median of 1.0 kg (IQR -1.0, 4.0, n=1131) and 3.0 kg (IQR; -1.0, 6.0 n=218) in weight from baseline, 
respectively. 
Changes in laboratory chemistries 
In both HPTN 083 and HPTN 084, a similar proportion of participants in the cabotegravir and 
TDF/FTC groups were observed to have elevated hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) levels and 
maximum post baseline increases were mostly Grades 1 and 2. In HPTN 083, the number of 
participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who experienced maximum post baseline Grade 3 
or 4 ALT levels were 40 (2%) vs 44 (2%) and Grade 3 or 4 AST levels were; 68 (3%) vs 79 (3%), 
respectively. In HPTN 084, the number of participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who 
experienced maximum post baseline Grade 3 or 4 ALT levels were 12 (< 1%) vs 18 (1%) and Grade 3 
and 4 AST levels were; 15 (< 1%) vs 14 (< 1%), respectively.  
A few participants in both the cabotegravir and TDF/FTC groups had adverse reactions of AST or 
ALT increased which resulted in discontinuation of study product. In HPTN 083, the number of 
participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who discontinued due to ALT increased were: 29 
(1%) vs 31 (1%) and due to AST increased were 7 (< 1%) vs 8 (< 1%), respectively. In HPTN 084, the 
number of participants in the cabotegravir vs TDF/FTC groups who discontinued due to ALT 
increased were 12 (< 1%) vs 15 (< 1%) and there were no discontinuations due to AST increased. 
Adolescents 
Based on data from two open-label multicenter clinical trials in 64 HIV-uninfected, at-risk adolescents 
(below 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 35 kg at enrolment) receiving cabotegravir, no new safety 
issues were identified in adolescents compared with the safety profile established in adults receiving 
cabotegravir for HIV-1 PrEP in HPTN 083 and HPTN 084.  
Based on data from the Week 16 analysis of the MOCHA study in 23 HIV-infected adolescents (aged 
at least 12 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg) receiving background combination anti-retroviral therapy, no 
new safety concerns were identified in adolescents with the addition of oral cabotegravir followed by 
injectable cabotegravir (n=8) when compared with the safety profile established with cabotegravir in 
adults (see section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for Apretude overdose. If overdose occurs, the individual should be 
treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. 
Cabotegravir is known to be highly protein bound in plasma; therefore, dialysis is unlikely to be 
helpful in removal of medicinal product from the body.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, integrase inhibitor, ATC code: J05AJ04  
Mechanism of action 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabotegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand 
transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV 
replication cycle. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Antiviral activity in cell culture 
Cabotegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean 
concentration of cabotegravir necessary to reduce viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) values of 
0.22 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 0.74 nM in 293T cells and 0.57 nM in MT-4 
cells. Cabotegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of 24 HIV-1 clinical 
isolates (three in each group of M clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and 3 in group O) with EC50 values 
ranging from 0.02 nM to 1.06 nM for HIV-1. Cabotegravir EC50 values against three HIV-2 clinical 
isolates ranged from 0.10 nM to 0.14 nM.  
Antiviral Activity in combination with other antiviral medicinal products 
No medicinal products with inherent anti-HIV activity were antagonistic to cabotegravir’s 
antiretroviral activity (in vitro assessments were conducted in combination with rilpivirine, 
lamivudine, tenofovir and emtricitabine). 
Resistance in vitro 
Isolation from wild-type HIV-1 and activity against resistant strains: Viruses with > 10-fold increase 
in cabotegravir EC50 were not observed during the 112-day passage of strain IIIB. The following 
integrase (IN) mutations emerged after passaging wild type HIV-1 (with T124A polymorphism) in the 
presence of cabotegravir: Q146L (fold-change range 1.3-4.6), S153Y (fold-change range 2.8-8.4), and 
I162M (fold-change = 2.8). As noted above, the detection of T124A is selection of a pre-existing 
minority variant that does not have differential susceptibility to cabotegravir. No amino acid 
substitutions in the integrase region were selected when passaging the wild-type HIV-1 NL-432 in the 
presence of 6.4 nM of cabotegravir through Day 56.  
Among the multiple mutants, the highest fold-change was observed with mutants containing Q148K or 
Q148R. E138K/Q148H resulted in a 0.92-fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir but 
E138K/Q148R resulted in a 12-fold decrease in susceptibility and E138K/Q148K resulted in an 81-
fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir. G140C/Q148R and G140S/Q148R resulted in a 22- and 
12-fold decrease in susceptibility to cabotegravir, respectively. While N155H did not alter 
susceptibility to cabotegravir, N155H/Q148R resulted in a 61-fold decrease in susceptibility to 
cabotegravir.  Other multiple mutants, which resulted in a FC between 5 and 10, are: T66K/L74M 
(FC=6.3), G140S/Q148K (FC=5.6), G140S/Q148H (FC=6.1) and E92Q/N155H (FC=5.3).  
Resistance in vivo 
HPTN 083 
In the primary analysis of the HPTN 083 study, there were 13 incident infections on the cabotegravir 
arm and 39 incident infections on the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) arm. In 
the cabotegravir arm, 5 incident infections occurred when receiving cabotegravir PrEP injections, of 
which 4 participants received on-time injections and 1 participant had one injection off-schedule. Five 
incident infections occurred ≥ 6 months after the last dose of cabotegravir PrEP. Three incident 
infections occurred during the oral lead-in period. 
HIV genotyping and phenotyping were attempted at the first visit where HIV viral load was > 500 
copies/mL. Of the 13 incident infections in the cabotegravir arm, 4 participants had INSTI resistance 
mutations. In the TDF/FTC arm, the 4 participants with NRTI resistance (including 3 who had multi-
class resistance) included 3 with M184V/I and one with K65R. 
None of the 5 participants who were infected after prolonged interruption from cabotegravir 
administration had INSTI resistance mutations. Neither genotype nor phenotype could be generated 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for one of the 5 participants, with just 770 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA. Integrase phenotype could not be 
generated for one of the remaining 4 participants. The remaining 3 participants retained susceptibility 
to all INSTIs. 
Three participants became infected during the oral lead-in phase, prior to receiving cabotegravir 
injections.  One participant with undetectable plasma cabotegravir levels had no INSTI resistance 
mutations and was susceptible to all INSTIs. Two participants with detectable plasma cabotegravir 
concentrations had INSTI resistance mutations. The first participant had INSTI resistant mutations 
E138E/K, G140G/S, Q148R and E157Q. Integrase phenotype could not be generated. The second 
participant had INSTI resistance mutations E138A and Q148R. This virus was resistant to 
cabotegravir (fold-change =5.92) but susceptible to dolutegravir (fold-change=1.69). 
Five participants acquired HIV-1, despite on time cabotegravir injections for 4 participants and one 
off-schedule injection for one participant. Two participants had viral loads too low to analyse.  The 
third participant had no INSTI resistance mutations at the first viraemic visit (Week 17) but had 
R263K at 112 and 117 days later. While phenotype could not be determined 112 days later, day 117 
phenotype showed this virus to be susceptible to both cabotegravir (fold-change= 2.32) and 
dolutegravir (fold-change=2.29). The fourth participant had INSTI resistance mutations G140A and 
Q148R. Phenotype showed resistance to cabotegravir (fold-change=13) but susceptibility to 
dolutegravir (fold-change=2.09). The fifth participant had no INSTI resistance mutations.  
In addition to the 13 incident infections, one further participant was HIV-1 infected at enrolment and 
had no INSTI resistance mutations at that time, however, 60 days later, INSTI resistance mutation 
E138K and Q148K were detected. Phenotype could not be generated. 
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was performed to better 
characterise the timing of HIV infections. As a result, one of the 13 incident infections in a participant 
receiving on time cabotegravir injections was determined to be a prevalent infection. 
HPTN 084 
In the primary analysis of the HPTN 084 study, there were 4 incident infections on the cabotegravir 
arm and 36 incident infections on the TDF/FTC arm.   
In the cabotegravir arm, 2 incident infections occurred while receiving injections; one participant had 
3 delayed cabotegravir injections and both had been non-adherent to oral cabotegravir.  
Two incident infections occurred after the last dose of oral cabotegravir; both participants were non-
adherent to oral cabotegravir. The first HIV positive visit occurred approx. 11 weeks after enrolment 
for one participant and 57 weeks after enrolment for the other. 
HIV genotyping was attempted at the first visit where HIV viral load was > 500 c/mL (first viraemic 
visit). HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 cabotegravir arm participants. No major 
INSTI resistance mutations were detected. 
HIV genotyping results were available for 33 of the 36 incident infections in the TDF/FTC group. One 
participant had a major NRTI mutation (M184V); this participant also had NNRTI resistance with the 
mutation K103N.  Nine other participants had NNRTI resistance (7 had K103N, alone or with E138A 
or P225H; 1 had K101E alone; 1 had E138K alone). 
Following the primary analysis, extended retrospective virologic testing was performed to better 
characterise the timing of HIV-1 infections. As a result, 1 of the 4 HIV-1 incident infections in 
participants receiving cabotegravir was determined to be a prevalent infection. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of cabotegravir for PrEP has been evaluated in two randomised (1:1), double blind, 
multi-site, two-arm, controlled studies. The efficacy of cabotegravir was compared with daily oral 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC). 
Participants randomised to receive cabotegravir initiated oral lead-in dosing with one 30 mg 
cabotegravir tablet and a placebo daily, for up to 5 weeks, followed by cabotegravir intramuscular 
(IM) injection (single 600 mg injection, at months 1, 2 and every 2 months thereafter and a daily 
placebo tablet. Participants randomised to receive TDF/FTC initiated oral TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg 
and placebo for up to 5 weeks, followed by oral TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg daily and placebo (IM) 
injection (3 mL, 20% lipid injectable emulsion at months 1, 2 and every 2 months thereafter). 
HPTN 083 
In HPTN 083, a non-inferiority study, 4566 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with 
men, were randomised 1:1 and received either cabotegravir (n=2281) or TDF/FTC (n=2285) as 
blinded study medicinal products up to Week 153.  
At baseline, the median age of participants was 26 years, 12% were transgender women, 72% were 
non-white, 67% were < 30 years and < 1% were over 60 years. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of incident HIV infections among participants randomised to oral 
cabotegravir and cabotegravir injections compared to oral TDF/FTC (corrected for early stopping). 
The primary analysis demonstrated the superiority of cabotegravir compared to TDF/FTC with a 66% 
reduction in the risk of acquiring incident HIV infection, hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.34 (0.18, 0.62); 
further testing revealed one of the infections on cabotegravir to be prevalent then yielding a 69% 
reduction in the risk of incident infection relative to TDF/FTC (see Table 4).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Cabotegravir pharmacokinetics is comparable between healthy and HIV-infected subjects, with the 
same ADME observed across all populations. The PK variability of cabotegravir is moderate. In Phase 
I studies in healthy subjects, between-subject CVb% for AUC, Cmax, and Ctau ranged from 26 to 34% 
across healthy subject studies. Within-subject variability (CVw%) is lower than between-subject 
variability.

models for subjects in Phase III treatment studies. 
2  tau is dosing interval: 24 hours for oral administration. 
3  Oral lead-in pharmacokinetic parameter values represent steady-state. 
Absorption 
Cabotegravir is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with median Tmax at 3 hours post dose 
for tablet formulation. With once daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady-state is achieved by 7 days. 
Cabotegravir may be administered with or without food. Bioavailability of cabotegravir is independent 
of meal content: high fat meals increased cabotegravir AUC(0-∞) by 14% and increased Cmax by 14% 
relative to fasted conditions. These increases are not clinically significant. 
The absolute bioavailability of cabotegravir has not been established. 
Distribution 
Cabotegravir is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, based on in vitro data. Following 
administration of oral tablets, the mean apparent oral volume of distribution (Vz/F) in plasma was 
12.3 L. In humans, the estimate of plasma cabotegravir Vc/F was 5.27 L and Vp/F was 2.43 L. These 
volume estimates, along with the assumption of high bioavailability, suggest some distribution of 
cabotegravir to the extracellular space. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabotegravir is present in the female and male genital tract, following a single 600 mg IM injection, as 
observed in a study in healthy participants (n=15). Median cabotegravir concentrations at Day 3 (the 
earliest tissue PK sample) were 0.49 µg/mL in cervical tissue, 0.29 µg/mL in cervicovaginal fluid, 
0.37 µg/mL in vaginal tissue, 0.32 µg/mL in rectal tissue, and 0.69 µg/mL in rectal fluid, which are 
above the in vitro PA-IC90. 
In vitro, cabotegravir was not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, 
OATP2B1, OATP1B3 or organic cation transporter (OCT1). 
Biotransformation 
Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by UGT1A1 with a minor UGT1A9 component. Cabotegravir is 
the predominant circulating compound in plasma, representing > 90% of plasma total radiocarbon. 
Following oral administration in humans, cabotegravir is primarily eliminated through metabolism; 
renal elimination of unchanged cabotegravir is low (< 1% of the dose). Forty-seven percent of the total 
oral dose is excreted as unchanged cabotegravir in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due 
to unabsorbed medicinal product or biliary excretion of the glucuronide conjugate, which can be 
further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. Cabotegravir was observed to be 
present in duodenal bile samples. The glucuronide metabolite was also present in some but not all of 
the duodenal bile samples. Twenty-seven percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, 
primarily as a glucuronide metabolite (75% of urine radioactivity, 20% of total dose). 
Cabotegravir is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of the following enzymes and transporters: CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, 
UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17, P-gp, BCRP, Bile salt 
export pump (BSEP), OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 
(MATE) 1, MATE 2-K, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4. 
Elimination 
Cabotegravir has a mean terminal half-life of 41 h and an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 0.21 L per 
hour. 
Polymorphisms 
In a meta-analysis of healthy and HIV-infected subject trials, subjects with UGT1A1 genotypes 
conferring poor cabotegravir metabolism had a 1.3- to 1.5-fold mean increase in steady-state 
cabotegravir AUC, Cmax, and Ctau compared with subjects with genotypes associated with normal 
metabolism via UGT1A1. These differences are not considered clinically relevant. No dose adjustment 
is required in subjects with UGT1A1 polymorphisms. 
Special populations 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure 
of cabotegravir, therefore no dose adjustment is required on the basis of gender. 
Race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of 
cabotegravir, therefore no dose adjustment is required on the basis of race. 
Body Mass Index (BMI) 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of BMI on the exposure of 
cabotegravir, therefore no dose adjustment is required on the basis of BMI. 
Adolescents

c  Oral lead-in pharmacokinetic parameter values represent steady-state. 
The pharmacokinetics and dosing recommendations of cabotegravir in paediatric individuals less than 
12 years of age or weighing less than 35 kg have not been established. 
Elderly  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabotegravir revealed no clinically relevant effect of age on 
cabotegravir exposure. Pharmacokinetic data for cabotegravir in subjects of > 65 years old are limited.  
Renal impairment 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment 
(CrCL < 30 mL/min and not on dialysis) and matching healthy subjects were observed. No dose 
adjustment is necessary for individuals with mild to severe renal impairment (not on dialysis). 
Cabotegravir has not been studied in individuals on dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment and matching healthy subjects were observed. No dose adjustment is necessary for 
individuals with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score A or B). The effect of severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir has not been 
studied.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
Cabotegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian 
cells, and an in vivo rodent micronucleus assay. Cabotegravir was not carcinogenic in long term 
studies in the mouse and rat. 
Reproductive toxicology studies 
No effect on male or female fertility was observed in rats treated with cabotegravir at oral doses up to 
1000 mg/kg/day (> 20 times the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended dose (MRHD) of 
30 mg/day orally). 
In an embryo-foetal development study there were no adverse developmental outcomes following oral 
administration of cabotegravir to pregnant rabbits up to a maternal toxic dose of 2,000 mg/kg/day 
(0.66 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD) or to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 
mg/kg/day (> 30 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD). In rats, alterations in foetal growth 
(decreased body weights) were observed at oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. Studies in pregnant rats 
showed that cabotegravir crosses the placenta and can be detected in foetal tissue. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rat pre- and post-natal (PPN) studies cabotegravir reproducibly induced a delayed onset of 
parturition, and an increase in the number of stillbirths and neonatal mortalities at oral dose of 1,000 
mg/kg/day (> 30 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD). A lower dose of 5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 10 times the exposure in humans at the oral MRHD) cabotegravir was not associated 
with delayed parturition or neonatal mortality. In rabbit and rat studies there was no effect on survival 
when foetuses were delivered by caesarean section. Given the exposure ratio, the relevance to humans 
is unknown. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
The effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of cabotegravir has been evaluated in repeat 
oral dose toxicity studies in rats (26 weeks) and in monkeys (39 weeks). There were no drug-related 
adverse reactions in rats or monkeys given cabotegravir orally at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day or 
500 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
In a 14 day and 28 day monkey toxicity study, gastro-intestinal (GI) effects (body weight loss, emesis, 
loose/watery faeces, and moderate to severe dehydration) were observed and was the result of local 
medicinal product administration (oral) and not systemic toxicity. 
In a 3 month study in rats, when cabotegravir was administered by monthly sub-cutaneous (SC) 
injection (up to 100 mg/kg/dose); monthly IM injection (up to 75 mg/kg/dose) or weekly SC injection 
(100 mg/kg/dose), there were no adverse reactions noted and no new target organ toxicities (at 
exposures > 49 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD of 600 mg IM dose).

Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the launch of APRETUDE in a Member State, the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) 
must agree the content and format of the educational materials, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the program, with the National Competent Authority. 
To supplement routine risk minimisation activities, the educational materials are aimed at mitigating 
the risks of HIV seroconversion, the development of resistance and medication errors, including 
treatment noncompliance in individuals taking APRETUDE by increasing awareness of these risks 
and providing guidance information for prescribers and individuals at risk. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where APRETUDE is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and individuals at risk who are expected to prescribe and/or use APRETUDE have 
access to/are provided with the following educational package, which comprises of the following:  
  Guide for prescribers 
  Guide for individuals at risk  
  Prescribers’ checklist 
  Reminder Card for individuals at risk 
Key messages of the additional risk minimization measures for APRETUDE for Pre Exposure 
Prophylaxis (PrEP) are outlined below.  
Guide for prescribers shall contain the following elements: 
•  Details on use of APRETUDE for pre-exposure prophylaxis as part of an overall HIV-1 
infection prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (such as e. 
g. knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections, 
condom use).  
•  Reminder that APRETUDE should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in 
• 
• 
individuals confirmed to be HIV negative.  
Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at each injection visit while taking 
APRETUDE for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) 
exposures to HIV-1 are suspected, HIV-1 status should be reconfirmed.  
•  Details on the potential risk of developing resistance to APRETUDE if an individual acquires 
HIV-1 either before, or while taking APRETUDE, or following discontinuation of 
APRETUDE.  
Importance of commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in instances of HIV-1 acquisition in 
individuals who are suspected or confirmed with a diagnosis of HIV-1.  
• 
•  APRETUDE does not constitute a complete ART regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 and HIV 
resistance mutations have emerged in individuals with undetected HIV 1 infection who were 
only taking APRETUDE.  
•  Consideration of alternative forms of non-long-acting PrEP following discontinuation of 
APRETUDE injection for those individuals that remain at risk of HIV acquisition, which 
should be initiated within 2 months of the final APRETUDE injection.  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Importance of counselling individuals at risk periodically to strictly adhere to the 
recommended APRETUDE dosing schedule/appointments to reduce the risk of HIV-1 
acquisition and the potential development of resistance. 
Prescriber checklist shall provide reminders for evaluations and counselling at initial and 
follow up visit, including: 
•  Test to re-confirm HIV-1 negative status at each injection visit to minimise the risk of 
developing resistance to APRETUDE.  
•  To reconfirm HIV-1 status, if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are 
present and recent (< 1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected. 
•  To commence antiretroviral therapy (ART) in instances of HIV-1 acquisition in individuals 
who are suspected or confirmed with a diagnosis of HIV-1.  
•  To discuss and reiterate the importance of adherence to the recommended APRETUDE dosing 
schedule/appointments to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and the potential development 
of resistance. 
•  To summarise and restate that APRETUDE for pre-exposure prophylaxis is part of an overall 
HIV-1 infection prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures 
(such as e. g. knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted 
infections, condom use). 
•  To consider alternative forms of non-long-acting PrEP following discontinuation of 
APRETUDE injection for those individuals that remain at risk of HIV acquisition, which 
should be initiated within 2 months of the final APRETUDE injection.

for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Apretude is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Apretude 
3.  How Apretude is given 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Apretude 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Apretude is and what it is used for 
Apretude contains the active ingredient cabotegravir. Cabotegravir belongs to a group of anti-
retroviral medicines called integrase inhibitors (INIs). 
Apretude is used to help prevent HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg who 
are at an increased risk of infection. This is called pre-exposure prophylaxis: PrEP (see section 2).                                                                                                                                                                 
It should be used in combination with safer sex practices, such as use of condoms. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Apretude 
Do not use Apretude:  
  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabotegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
  If you are HIV positive or you do not know if you are HIV positive. Apretude can only help reduce 
your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. You must get tested to make sure you are HIV 
negative before taking Apretude. 
  if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent fits). 
  rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). 
These medicines reduce the effectiveness of Apretude by decreasing the amount of Apretude in the 
blood. 
  If you think these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Just taking Apretude may not prevent HIV infection.  
HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who is HIV positive or by transfer of infected 
blood. Although Apretude lowers the risk of becoming infected, you can still get HIV when taking this 
medicine.  
Other measures should be taken to further reduce your risk of getting HIV:  
•  Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections when your doctor tells you to. These 
infections make it easier for HIV to infect you.  
•  Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex.  
•  Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.  
•  Do not share personal items that may have blood or body fluids on them (such as razor blades or 
toothbrushes).  
Discuss with your doctor the additional precautions needed to further decrease the risk of getting HIV.  
Reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
There is a risk of resistance to this medicine if you get infected with HIV. This means that the 
medicine will not prevent HIV infection. To minimise this risk and to prevent infection with HIV, it is 
important that you:  
•  attend your planned appointments to receive your Apretude injection. Talk to your doctor if you 
are thinking about stopping injections, as this may increase your risk of getting a HIV infection. If 
you do stop, or are late receiving your Apretude injection, you will need to take other medicines or 
precautions to reduce your risk of getting HIV and possibly developing viral resistance.   
•    get tested for HIV when your doctor tells you.  You must be regularly tested to make sure that you 
remain HIV-1 negative while taking Apretude. 
•    tell your doctor straight away if you think you have been infected with HIV (you may get a flu-
like illness). They may want to do more tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. 
Apretude injection is a long-acting medicine 
If you stop Apretude injections, cabotegravir will remain in your system for up to a year or more after 
your last injection, but this will not be enough to protect you from becoming infected.  
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive Apretude injection. Talk to your 
doctor if you are thinking about stopping PrEP.  
Once you stop Apretude injections you may need to take other medicines to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV infection or use other safe sex precautions.

You will be given your first and second dose of Apretude one month apart. After the second dose, you 
will be given Apretude as a single injection once every 2 months.  
Before starting treatment with Apretude injections, you and your doctor may decide first take 
cabotegravir tablets (called oral lead-in period). The lead-in period allows you and your doctor to 
assess whether it’s appropriate to proceed with injections. 
If you decide to start treatment with tablets: 
  You should take one 30 mg Apretude tablet once a day, for approximately one month. 
  You should have your first injection on the same day as your last tablet or no later than 3 days 
after. 
  You will then receive an injection every 2 months

If you miss a Apretude injection 
Contact your doctor immediately to make a new appointment.  
It is important that you keep your regular planned appointments to receive your injection and reduce 
the risk of getting HIV (see section 2). Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about stopping 
Apretude.  
Talk to your doctor if you think you will not be able to receive your Apretude injection at the usual 
time. Your doctor may recommend you take cabotegravir tablets instead, until you are able to receive 
an Apretude injection again. 
Don’t stop receiving Apretude injections without advice from your doctor. 
Keep receiving Apretude injections for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your 
doctor advises you to. If you stop and you are still at risk of getting HIV your doctor must start you on 
another PrEP medicine within 2 months of your last Apretude injection.

Questions and Answers 
1.  If the pack has been stored in the refrigerator, is it safe to warm the vial up to room 
temperature more quickly? 
You should wait at least 15 minutes before you are ready to give the injection to allow the medicine 
to reach room temperature. 
It is best to let the vial come to room temperature naturally. However, you can use the warmth of 
your hands to speed up the warm-up time, but make sure the vial does not get above 30°C. 
Do not use any other heating methods. 
2.  How long can the medicine be left in the syringe? 
It is best to inject the (room temperature) medicine as soon as possible after drawing it up. However, 
the medicine can remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours before injecting. 
If the medicine remains in the syringe for more than 2 hours, the filled syringe and needle must be 
discarded. 
3.  Why do I need to inject air into the vial? 
Injecting 1 mL of air into the vial makes it easier to draw up the dose into the syringe.  
Without the air, some liquid may flow back into the vial unintentionally, leaving less medicine than 
intended in the syringe. 
4.  Why is the ventrogluteal administration approach recommended? 
The ventrogluteal approach, into the gluteus medius muscle, is recommended because it is located 
away from major nerves and blood vessels. A dorso-gluteal approach into the gluteus maximus 
muscle is acceptable, if preferred by the health care professional. The injection should not be 
administered in any other site.

3.  How to take Apretude  
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Apretude  
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Apretude is and what it is used for 
Apretude contains the active ingredient cabotegravir. Cabotegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral 
medicines called integrase inhibitors (INIs). 
Apretude is used to help prevent HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg who 
are at an increased risk of infection.  This is called pre-exposure prophylaxis: PrEP (see section 2). 
It should be used in combination with safer sex practices, such as use of condoms. 
Your doctor may advise you to take Apretude tablets before you are given a Apretude injection for the 
first time (called oral lead-in period, see section 3).  
If you are being given Apretude injections, but you are not able to receive your injection, your doctor 
may also recommend that you take Apretude tablets instead, until you can receive the injection again 
(see section 3). 
2.  What you need to know before you take Apretude 
Do not use Apretude:  
  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabotegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
  If you are HIV positive or you do not know if you are HIV positive.  Apretude can only help 
reduce your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. You must get tested to make sure you are 
HIV negative before taking Apretude. 
  if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
 carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent fits). 
 rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These medicines reduce the effectiveness of Apretude by decreasing the amount of Apretude in the 
blood 
  If you think these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Just taking Apretude may not prevent HIV infection.  
HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who is HIV positive or by transfer of infected 
blood. Although Apretude lowers the risk of becoming infected, you can still get HIV when taking this 
medicine.  
Other measures should be taken to further reduce your risk of getting HIV:  
•  Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections when your doctor tells you to. These 
infections make it easier for HIV to infect you.  
•  Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex.  
•  Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.  
• 
 Do not share personal items that may have blood or body fluids on them (such as razor blades or 
toothbrushes).  
Discuss with your doctor the additional precautions needed to further decrease the risk getting HIV.  
Reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
There is a risk of resistance to this medicine if you get infected with HIV. This means that the 
medicine will not prevent HIV infection. To minimise this risk and to prevent infection with HIV, it is 
important that you:  
take Apretude tablets every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been 
• 
at risk of HIV infection. Do not miss any doses of Apretude or stop taking it. Missing doses may 
increase your risk of getting HIV infection.  
get tested for HIV when your doctor tells you.  You must be regularly tested to make sure 
• 
that you remain HIV-1 negative while taking Apretude. 
tell your doctor straight away if you think you may have been infected with HIV (you may 
• 
get a flu-like illness). They may want to do more tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. 
Liver problems 
Let your doctor know if you have liver problems. You may need to be more closely monitored. (See 
also ‘Uncommon side effects’ in section 4). 
Adolescents  
Your doctor will discuss your mental health with you before and while receiving Apretude. Let your 
doctor know if you have mental health problems. You may need to be more closely monitored (See 
also section 4). 
Allergic reaction  
Apretude contains cabotegravir, which is an integrase inhibitor. Integrase inhibitors, including 
cabotegravir, can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. You need to 
know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re receiving Apretude.  
 Read the information in ‘Possible side effects’ in section 4 of this leaflet. 
Children and adolescents 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents less than 12 years of age or weighing less 
than 35 kg, because it has not been studied in these individuals. 
Other medicines and Apretude 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines including 
other medicines bought without a prescription. 
Some medicines can affect how Apretude works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. 
Apretude can also affect how some other medicines work. 
Apretude must not be given with some other medicines that may affect how well the medicine works 
(see ‘Do not use Apretude’  in section 2). These include: 
•  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy 
and prevent fits). 
rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). 
• 
Tell your doctor if you are taking: 
•  antacids (medicines to treat indigestion and heartburn). Antacids can stop the medicine in 
Apretude tablets from being absorbed into your body. Do not take these medicines in the 2 hours 
before you take Apretude or for at least 4 hours after you take it. 
 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking this medicine. Your doctor may decide that you 
need extra check-ups. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask

3. 
How to take Apretude 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
You must have a HIV-negative test before taking Apretude. 
When you start treatment with Apretude injections, you and your doctor may decide to first start 
treatment with cabotegravir tablets in an oral lead-in period.  
This allows your doctor to assess whether it’s appropriate to proceed with injections. 
If you decide to start treatment with tablets for the oral lead-in: 
  You should take one 30 mg Apretude tablet once a day, for approximately one month.  
  After one month of tablets, you should receive your first injection on the same day as your last 
tablet or no later than 3 days after. 
  You will then receive an injection every 2 months

tablets instead, until you can receive an injection again. 
How to take the tablets 
Apretude tablets should be swallowed with a small amount of water. They can be taken with or 
without food.  
Do not take antacids (medicines to treat indigestion and heartburn) during the 2 hours before you take 
a Apretude tablet or for at least 4 hours after you take it, as this can stop Apretude tablets being 
absorbed into your body and make it less effective. 
If you take more Apretude than you should  
If you take too many tablets of Apretude, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice and you will 
be treated as needed. If possible, show them the Apretude tablet bottle. 
If you forget to take Apretude   
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Apretude, take the missed tablet as soon as 
possible. If you notice after 12 hours, then skip that dose and take the next dose as usual.  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking Apretude, take another tablet. If you vomit more than 4 
hours after taking Apretude you should not take another tablet until your next scheduled dose. 
Don’t stop taking Apretude without advice from your doctor  
Take Apretude for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your doctor advises you to.

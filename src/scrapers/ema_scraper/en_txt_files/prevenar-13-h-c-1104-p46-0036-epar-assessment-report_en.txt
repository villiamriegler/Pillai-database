SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) 
13vPnC contains saccharides from  pneumococcal  serotypes 1, 3, 4,  5, 6A,  6B,  7F,  9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria toxin cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197). 
The  vaccine  is  formulated  to  contain  2.2  μg  of  each  saccharide,  except  for  4.4  μg  of  6B  per  0.5-mL 
dose. The final formulation contains 5  mM succinate  buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, with 0.125 mg of 
aluminium as aluminium phosphate per 0.5-mL dose. 
Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
Wyeth  has  developed  Prevenar  13,  a  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC),  as  a 
successor  to  the  currently  registered  vaccine,  Prevenar,  for  use  in  infants  and  young  children  to 
prevent pneumococcal disease (invasive pneumococcal disease [IPD], nonbacteremic pneumonia, and 
acute  otitis  media  [AOM])  caused  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  contained  in  the  vaccine. 
Prevenar is a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) that contains serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 
18C, 19F, and 23F. In addition to these serotypes, 13vPnC contains serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. 
The MAH submitted final reports for:

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  immune  response  to  the  13  pneumococcal 
conjugates  (1,  3,  4,  5,  6A,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19A,  19F,  and  23F)  induced  by  13vPnC  when 
measured 1 month after the infant series. 
The safety objective was to evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by 
the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).  
Secondary objectives were as follows: 
 
 
To assess the immune response to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 
14,  18C,  19A,  19F,  and  23F)  induced  by  13vPnC  when  measured  1  month  after  the  toddler 
dose. 
To  evaluate  the  comparability/superiority  of  immunogenicity  data  after  the  infant  series  and 
after  the  toddler  dose  between  this  study  in  Japanese  infants  (6096A1-3003-JA)  and  the 
pivotal licensure study in the United States (6096A1-004). 
  Study design 
This  was  an  open-label,  single-group,  multicenter  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  administered  SC  to  Japanese  infants.  No  concomitant  vaccines  were 
administered. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 165 subjects were to participate in this study at 20 to 30 sites to achieve a total of 140 
evaluable subjects. 
 
Treatments 
All subjects were to be vaccinated with open-label 13vPnC in a schedule that included a 3-dose infant 
series  and  a  toddler  (booster)  dose.  The  protocol  stated  that  it  was  preferable  for  infants  to  be 
vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. However, the first vaccination (dose 1) could be given at any 
time between 2 and 6 months of age, with dose 2 given at least 28 days after dose 1, dose 3 given at 
least 28 days after dose 2, and with the infant series being completed before 12 months of age. The 
toddler dose could be administered at any time between 12 and 15 months of age, but at least 60 days 
after dose 3. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Blood samples (5 mL) were to be obtained from all subjects at 4 timepoints: before dose 1, one month 
(28 to 42 days) after dose 3, before the toddler dose, and one month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler 
dose. For all subjects and for each of the 4 blood samples, serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
concentrations were to be determined for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes. 
Parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  were  asked  to  monitor  and  record  in  an  electronic  diary  (e-diary)  the 
subject’s local reactions and systemic events (including the use of antipyretic medication to treat and 
prevent  symptoms)  for  7  days  after  each  vaccination.  AEs  were  to  be  collected  and  recorded  on  the 
CRF  based  on  ancillary  information  recorded  by  the  parents/legal  guardians  in  a  paper  diary,  clinical 
evaluation  during  a  study  visit,  and  verbal  questioning  of  the  parent/legal  guardian  about  the  child’s 
health  since  the  last  visit.  AEs  were  collected  from  the  signing  of  the  ICF  to  visit  4  (the  visit  for  the 
postinfant series blood draw) and from visit 5 (toddler dose) to visit 6. At visit 5 any newly diagnosed 
chronic medical conditions or serious adverse events (SAEs) since visit 4 were to be recorded. All SAEs 
were recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 6. 
  Statistical Methods 
The primary endpoint for each of the pneumococcal serotypes was the proportion of subjects achieving 
a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  This 
choice  of  endpoints  was  based  on  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  guideline  for  the 
pneumococcal serotypes. 
The  secondary  endpoints  for  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  were  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL after the toddler dose, and the serotype-
specific  geometric  mean  IgG  concentrations  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series,  before  the 
toddler dose, and 1 month after the toddler dose.

The  comparison  of  interest  was  to  evaluate  the  comparability  of  immunogenicity  data  1  month  after 
the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose between this study in Japanese infants (6096A1-
3003) and the pivotal licensure study in the United States (6096A1-004). 
Unless  specified  otherwise,  the  following  analyses  were  performed  for  each  of  the  13  pneumococcal 
serotypes, using data for both time points (infant series and toddler dose) and for both the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations and the all-available immunogenicity populations: 
 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Specified Concentrations of IgG  
These  analyses  were  performed  for  the  protocol-specified  level  of  ≥0.35  μg/mL  and  also  for  the 
additional level of ≥0.15 μg/mL, which was specified in the SAP. 
Values  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.35  μg/mL  in  this  study 
(3003) were compared with reference values from the pivotal US licensure study (004). For each of the 
pneumococcal serotypes, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% CIs on the difference in proportions (study 
3003 – study 004) were computed using the procedure of Chan and Zhang, and using the standardized 
test statistic and gamma = 0.000001. 
  Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations 
The  geometric  mean  concentration  (GMC)  of  serotype-specific  IgG  was  calculated  for  each  of  the  13 
pneumococcal serotypes at 4 timepoints: before  and after the infant series, and before and after the 
toddler dose. Each concentration was logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided 95% CIs 
were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed 
assay results computed using the Student t distribution. 
Values  for  IgG  GMCs  from  this  study  (3003)  were  compared  with  values  from  the  pivotal  US  study 
(004).  For  each  of  the  13  serotypes,  the  ratio  of  the  GMCs  (geometric  mean  ratio,  GMR)  was 
calculated, and the 95% CI was computed using the Student t distribution for the mean difference of 
the  measures  on  the  log scale  (the  GMC  from  study  3003  relative to  the  reference  value  from  study 
004). 
  Geometric Mean Fold Rise in Antibody Concentrations 
The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in the concentration of serotype-specific IgG was calculated for 
each  of  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  using  data from  the  determinations made  before  the  toddler 
dose  and  after  the  toddler  dose.  The  GMFRs  with  95%  CIs  were  computed  using  the  logarithmically 
transformed assay results and the Student t distribution. 
In  addition,  the  GMFRs  from  this  study  were  compared  with  those  from  study  004.  The  ratio  of  the 
GMFRs  and  the  corresponding  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  calculated.  The  CIs  were  computed  using  the 
Student t distribution for the mean difference of the measures on the logarithmic scale (the value from 
study 3003 relative to the value from study 004). The mean difference of the log-transformed results 
is equivalent to the mean of the ratio of the logarithmic scale: log (x/y) = (log x) – (log y).  
  Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves 
Results  for  IgG  concentrations  are  presented  graphically  using  reverse  cumulative  distribution  curves 
(RCDCs).  Only  data  for  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  populations  are  presented  in  RCDCs.  Separate 
RCDCs  were  prepared  for each  of  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes,  for both the  postinfant  series  and 
posttoddler dose determinations. To provide  for  comparison of data between studies, RCDCs for both 
study 3003 and study 004 are displayed on the same graph. 
  Safety analyses 
The  safety  endpoints  were  AEs,  local  reactions,  and  systemic  events,  including  fever  and  the  use  of 
antipyretic  medications  to  treat  and  prevent  symptoms.  Fever  was  defined  as  axillary  temperature 
≥37.5°C. 
The incidences of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were summarized separately for each dose 
of  study  vaccine  (dose  1,  dose  2,  dose  3,  and  the  toddler  dose).  AEs  were  also  summarized  for  any 
time during the infant series (dose 1, 2, or 3). 
The proportions of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 7-
day  period  after  each  vaccination  were  summarized  for  each  type  of  event.  These  data  were  also 
summarized  for  just  the  first  4  days  after  vaccination,  in  order  to  provide  data  for  comparison  with 
data  from  others  studies in  which  e-diary  data  were  collected  for  only  4 days  after  each  vaccination.

Local  reactions  were  also  summarized  according  to  severity  (mild,  moderate,  severe);  and  summary 
statistics for the duration (in days) of both local reactions and systemic events were reported. 
Summary  tabulations  of  AEs  were  produced  separately  for  solicited  (e-diary)  AEs  and  for  unsolicited 
AEs, and additional tabulations are provided for all AEs combined (both solicited and unsolicited). For 
summarization,  AEs  were  categorized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA).  AE  summaries  show,  for  each  MedDRA  preferred  term,  the  number  and  percentage  of 
subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. SAEs were summarized for the infant 
series and the toddler dose, rather than for each  vaccination separately. Additional  summaries by AE 
severity and by relationship to study vaccine were also produced. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Approximately 165 subjects were to participate in this study, per protocol. A total of 193 subjects were 
screened  and  enrolled,  and  written  informed  consent  was  provided  for  all  subjects.  All  193  subjects 
received  dose  1,  and  190  (98.4%)  received  both  dose  2  and  dose  3.  Five  subjects  (2.6%)  were 
withdrawn from the study during the infant series, while 188 (97.4%) completed the infant series.  
Three  subjects  (1.6%)  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  after  completing  the  infant  series  but  before 
receiving the toddler dose. A total of 185 subjects (95.9%) were vaccinated at the toddler dose, and all 
but 1 of these subjects completed the toddler dose. 
  Demographics and other baseline characteristics 
All subjects were Japanese, and 51.8% were male. The mean age at enrollment was 3.7 months, and 
the  mean  weight  at  enrollment  was  6.7  kg.  Demographic  characteristics  for  the  176  subjects  in  the 
evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population  in  study  3003  were  similar  to  those  for  all  enrolled 
subjects.  For  these  subjects,  the  mean  age  at  dose  1  was  3.7  months,  mean  age  at dose  2  was  5.1 
months, and the mean age at dose  3 was 6.7  months. For the  178 subjects in the  evaluable toddler 
immunogenicity  population,  the  mean  age  at  the  toddler  dose  was  12.6  months.  In  comparison,  in 
study 004, the mean age was 2.1 months at dose 1, 4.1 months at dose 2, and 6.1 months at dose 3.

Immunogenicity results 
Infant dose 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified Antibody Levels 
In  study  3003,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.35 
µg/mL 1 month after the infant series was 97.2% or higher for all 13 pneumococcal serotypes (Table 
9-3). In study 004, the proportion of responders was 87.3% or higher for all serotypes except serotype 
3,  for  which  the  proportion  of  responders  was  63.5%.  The  proportion  of  responders  was  higher  in 
study  3003  than  in  study  004  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype  19F  (for  which  the  proportion  was 
97.2% in study 3003 and 98.0% in study 004), and the difference between the studies was 11.0% or 
less for all serotypes except serotype 3 (difference of 36.5%). (Table 9-3). Results for the all-available 
infant immunogenicity population were similar to those observed for the evaluable infant population.

Proportion of Subjects Achieving an Additional Prespecified Antibody Level 
In  analyses  of  data  for  the  additional  antibody  level  of  ≥0.15  µg/mL,  the  proportion  of  responders  1 
month  after  the  infant  series  in  study  3003  was  100%  for  all  serotypes  except  for  serotype  19F 
(98.9%)  and  serotype  23F  (98.3%);  and  in  study  004  the  proportion  of  responders  was  92.4%  or 
higher for all serotypes. The difference between the studies was greatest for serotype 3 (difference of 
7.6%) and serotype 6B (difference of 6.0%). 
Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves 
RCDCs  showing  the  distribution  of  IgG  responses  for  each  of  the 13  serotypes  after  the  infant  series 
were  provided in the clinical study report. For all 13 serotypes, the RCDCs were higher along most of 
the curve for study 3003 as compared with study 004. 
Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations 
In study 3003, GMCs for the 13 serotypes 1 month after the infant series ranged from 2.57µg/mL for 
serotype  23F  to  6.97  µg/mL  for  serotype  19A,  with  the  exception  of  serotype  14,  for  which  the 
concentration  was  14.69  µg/mL,  more  than  twice  that  for  any  other  serotype  (Table  9-4).  IgG 
concentrations were lower in study 004 for all 13 serotypes, ranging from 0.49 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 
2.57  µg/mL  for  serotype  7F,  with  serotype  14  again  being  an  outlier,  with  a  serum  concentration  of 
4.74 µg/mL. GMRs comparing data for study 3003 versus study 004 ranged from 1.72 for serotype 6A 
to 5.88 for serotype 3. Antibody GMCs for the 13 serotypes before the infant series ranged from a low 
of 0.03 µg/mL for serotype 4 to a high of 0.35 µg/mL for serotype 19A.

Toddler Dose 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified Antibody Levels 
In  study  3003,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.35  µg/mL  1  month 
after  the  toddler  dose  was  98.9%  or  greater  for  all  13  serotypes.  In  study  004,  the  proportion  of 
responders  was  98.7%  or  greater  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype  3,  for  which  the  proportion  was 
90.5% (Table 9-5). Data for the all-available infant immunogenicity population were similar (data were 
submitted but not shown in this AR).

Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves 
RCDCs  for  the  posttoddler  dose  time  point  were  provided  in  the  clinical  study  report.  For  all  13 
serotypes,  the  RCDCs  were  higher  along  most  of  the  curve  for  study  3003  as  compared  with  study 
004. 
Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations 
Before the Toddler Dose 
In  study  3003,  before  the  toddler  dose,  GMCs  for  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  ranged  from  0.73 
µg/mL for serotype 3 to 5.25 µg/mL for serotype 14 (Table 9-6). GMCs were lower in study 004 for all 
13  serotypes,  ranging  from  0.15  µg/mL  for  serotype  3  to 1.89  µg/mL  for  serotype  14.  GMRs  ranged 
from 2.37 for serotype 23F to 4.84 for serotype 3. 
Prevenar 13 P46 036 
Page 8/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the Toddler dose 
In study 3003, 1 month after the toddler dose, GMCs ranged from 2.06 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 16.33 
µg/mL for serotype 14 (Table 9-7). For all serotypes, GMCs 1 month after the toddler dose were higher 
than  GMCs  observed  before  the  toddler  dose,  demonstrating  the  booster  effect  of  the  toddler  dose. 
Furthermore,  GMCs  were  higher  after  the  toddler  dose  than  after  the  infant  series  for  all  serotypes 
except  serotype  3.  In  study  004,  GMCs  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  ranged  from  0.94  µg/mL  for 
serotype 3 to 11.53 µg/mL for serotype 6B. For all serotypes, IgG concentrations were higher in study 
3003  than  in  study  004,  with  GMRs  (study  3003  relative  to  study  004)  ranging  from  1.27  to  2.60 
(Table 9-7).

Assessor’s comment: The GMCs for serotype 3 were lower after the toddler doser than after the infant 
dose  in  study  6096A1-3003.  However,  the  titres  had  decreased  between  the  third  infant  dose  and 
before  the  toddler  dose,  which  indicates  that  there  was  indeed  a  response  to  the  toddler  dose.  The 
slightly lower response therefore does not seem to be the result of immune hyporesponsiveness, but it 
may  be  that  the  immunological  memory  induced  by  serotype  3  is  different  from  that  induced  by  the 
other serotypes. These results are consistent with what has been seen previously in other studies for 
serotype 3.  
Geometric Mean Fold Rises  
The  GMFRs  in  serum  IgG  concentrations  from  before  the  toddler  dose  to  1  month  after  the  toddler 
dose are summarized in Table 9-9 for both studies. In study 3003, GMFRs ranged from 2.83 to 7.48, 
while  in  study  004,  GMFRs  ranged  from  4.85  to  15.12.  For  all  serotypes,  the  GMFRs  were  higher  in 
study  004  than  in  study  3003,  with  GMFR  ratios  (study  3003/study  004)  ranging  from  0.38  to  0.79 
(Table 9-9). The relatively low GMFRs in study 3003 reflect the high GMCs observed before the toddler 
dose in that study.

  Safety results 
Local Reactions 
In comparing the data for local reactions, it should be noted that while 13vPnC was administered SC in 
study 3003, study vaccine was administered IM in study 004. 
Infant Series 
The number and percentage of subjects with local reactions reported within 7 days after each dose in 
the infant series are presented in Table 10-3 through Table 10-5. For comparison, data for the 13vPnC 
group in study 004 are also shown.   
In study 004, the incidence of tenderness after each dose was higher than in study 3003, both for any 
tenderness  (between  72%  and  79%)  and  for  significant  tenderness  (between  8%  and  14%).  In 
contrast,  the  incidence  of  induration  after  each  dose  was  higher  in  study  3003  (between  47%  and 
54%) than  in  study  004  (between  27%  and  38%), as  was  the  incidence  of  erythema  (between 67% 
and  75%  in  study  3003  and  between  35%  and  49%  in  study  004).  In  both  studies,  most  reports  of 
induration  and  erythema  were  mild.  Local  reactions  of  moderate  intensity  were  reported  more 
frequently  in  study  3003  than  in  study  004,  both  for  induration  (between  14%  and  30%  versus 
between 5% and 7%, respectively) and for erythema (between 24% and 44% versus between 1% and 
6%, respectively). There were no reports of severe induration or erythema in study 004, while in study 
3003, severe induration and severe erythema  were each reported for 2 subjects after dose 2 (1.3%) 
and  for  1  subject  after  dose  3  (0.7%).  In  study  004,  there  was  a  trend  toward  higher  incidences  of

tenderness, induration, and erythema with each  subsequent dose, while in study 3003, no pattern of 
increasing or decreasing incidence across doses was apparent.

The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  local  reactions  within  7  days  after  the  toddler  dose  are 
presented in Table 10-6. In study 3003, the incidence of each type of reaction after the toddler dose 
was similar to the incidence that had been observed during the infant series, whereas in study 004, the 
incidences were somewhat higher after the toddler dose than during the infant series. Similar to what 
was  seen  during  the  infant  series,  the  incidence  of  tenderness  after  the  toddler  dose  was  markedly 
higher  in  study  004  (81.2%)  than  in  study  3003  (18.2%),  while  the  incidences  of  induration  and 
erythema were higher in study 3003 (57.1% and 68.1%, respectively) than in study 004 (44.0% and 
54.4%). There were no reports of significant tenderness after the toddler dose in study 3003, while 10 
subjects  (15.4%)  experienced  significant  tenderness  in  study  004.  In  both  studies,  most  reports  of 
induration and erythema were mild. There were no reports of severe induration or erythema after the 
toddler dose  in study 004, while in study  3003,  severe induration was reported in  3  subjects (2.3%) 
and severe erythema was reported in 2 subjects (1.5%). 
Systemic Events 
Infant Series 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  systemic  events,  including  the  use  of  antipyretic 
medications,  within  7  days  after  each  dose  in  the  infant  series  are  presented  in  Table  10-7  through 
Table 10-9. In study 3003, fever was defined as an axillary temperature ≥37.5°C, while in study 004, 
fever  was  defined  as  a  core  (rectal)  temperature  ≥38.0°C.  In  the  following  tables,  the  incidence  of 
fever after each dose in the infant series is summarized for study 3003 only, using the protocol-defined 
criterion (any temperature ≥37.5°C). In addition, data from study 3003 are compared with those from 
study 004 using the criterion from study 004 for mild fever (≥38°C but ≤39°C). The protocols for both 
studies defined moderate fever as a temperature >39°C but ≤40°C and severe fever as a temperature 
>40°C.

Comparisons  of  data  between  the  studies  show  that  the  incidence  of  mild  fever  (defined  as  a 
temperature ≥38°C but ≤39°C) was substantially higher in study 004 (ranging from 24.0% to 43.2% 
across  doses)  than  in  study  3003  (ranging  from  6.7%  to  12.2%).  In  contrast,  the  incidences  of 
moderate fever (>39°C but ≤40°C) were similar in the 2 studies, between 1.2% and 2.8% after each 
dose, except after dose 3 in study 004, where the incidence of moderate fever was 8.5% (8 subjects). 
Severe fever (>40°C) was reported for only 1 subject, after dose 2 in study 3003. 
The  frequency  of  antipyretic  medication  use  within  7  days  after  each  dose  in  the  infant  series  was 
much higher in study 004 than in study 3003. Antipyretic medications were used to treat symptoms in 
≤6.5%  of  subjects  after  each  dose  in  study  3003,  compared  with  between  78.6%  and  82.4%  of 
subjects in study 004. Similarly, antipyretic medications were used to prevent symptoms in ≤3.3% of 
subjects after each dose in study 3003, compared with between 75.0% and 86.7% of subjects in study 
004. 
Other systemic events were consistently reported more frequently in study 004 than in study 3003: 
  Decreased  appetite  was  reported  for  ≤16.5%  of  subjects  in  study  3003  but  for  ≥54.8%  of 
 
 
subjects in study 004. 
Irritability  was  reported  for  ≤36.1%  of  subjects in  study  3003  but  for  ≥88.4%  of  subjects  in 
study 004. 
Increased sleep was reported for ≤40.6% of subjects in study 3003 but for ≥71.3% of subjects 
in study 004. 
  Decreased  sleep  was  reported  for  ≤23.1%  of  subjects  in  study  3003  but  for  ≥45.7%  of 
subjects in study 004. 
The  mean  duration  of  systemic  events  after  each  dose  of  the  infant  series  was  between  1.8  and  3.1 
days for all events except hives, for which the duration ranged from 1.0 day for 1 subject after dose 3 
to 4.0 days for 1 subject after dose 2.  
Toddler Dose 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting systemic events within 7 days after the toddler dose 
are  presented  in  Table  10-10.  In  study  3003,  the  incidence  of  fever  ≥37.5ºC  was  higher  after  the 
toddler  dose  (50.7%)  than  after  any  dose  in  the  infant  series  (maximum  of  40.3%),  as  was  the 
incidence of mild fever (≥38ºC but ≤39°C)  (20.4%,  compared with a maximum  of 12.2% during the 
Prevenar 13 P46 036

infant  series).  For  all other  types of  systemic events  in  study  3003,  there  was  no  clear trend toward 
higher  or  lower  incidence  after  the  toddler  dose  as  compared  with  the  infant  doses.  Similar  to  what 
was observed during the infant series, the incidence of each type of systemic event after the  toddler 
dose was consistently higher in study 004 than in study 3003. 
Spontaneously reported Adverse Events 
During the infant series, spontaneously reported AEs were reported for approximately 92% of subjects 
in study 3003 and 83% of subjects in study 004. In general, the types of AEs reported in both studies 
were  consistent  with  the  types  of  childhood  illnesses  and  conditions  commonly  occurring  in  this  age 
group.  In  study  3003,  the  types  of  AEs  reported  most  frequently  during  the  infant  series  were 
infections  (most  often  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  exanthema  subitum,  and 
bronchitis);  skin  disorders  (mostly  diaper  dermatitis  and  eczema);  general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  (mostly  injection  site  erythema  and  injection  site  induration); 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (mostly  diarrhea);  and  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders 
(mostly  rhinorrhea,  asthma,  and  upper  respiratory  tract  inflammation).  Similar  events  were  reported 
after the toddler dose. The types and frequencies of spontaneously reported AEs reported in study 004 
were similar to those observed in study 3003.  
In study 3003, a total of 30 SAEs were reported for 22 subjects (11.4%): 9 subjects (4.7%) during the 
infant series, 14 subjects (7.3%) after the infant series, and 1 subject (0.5%) after the toddler dose. 
Most were infections and infestations that required hospitalization. None of the SAEs were considered 
related to study vaccine by the investigator. There were no deaths during the study. 
Three (3) subjects were withdrawn from study 3003 because of AEs: 2 because of febrile convulsions 
(considered not related to study vaccine) and 1 because of injection site swelling (considered related to 
study vaccine). 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  local  reactions  induration  and  erythema  were  reported  more  frequently  in 
study 3003 than in study 004, while tenderness had a higher incidence in study 004 than in 3003. The 
same  pattern  was  seen  after  the  infant  and  toddler  doses.  The  systemic  reactions  also  differed 
between the two studies.

MAH overall conclusions for study 6096A1-3003-JA 
In conclusion, 13vPnC administered SC as a 3-dose infant series followed by a booster dose at 12 to 15 
months  of  age  was  immunogenic,  safe,  and  well  tolerated  in  Japanese  infants.  For  all  13  serotypes, 
serum  IgG concentrations were higher in Japanese  infants (study 3003) than in infants in the United 
States (study 004), with GMRs (3003 relative to 004) for the 13 serotypes ranging from 1.72 to 5.88 
after the infant series. The incidence of local reactions differed markedly between subjects vaccinated 
SC  in  study  3003  and  subjects  vaccinated  IM  in  study  004.  After  each  dose,  the  incidence  of 
tenderness  was  consistently  lower  in  study  3003  than  in  study  004,  while  the  incidences  of  both 
erythema  and  induration  were  consistently  higher  in  study  3003  than  in  study  004.  In  addition,  the 
incidence of mild fever (defined as a temperature ≥38°C but ≤39°C) was higher in study 004 than in 
study 3003. The adverse event profile of 13vPnC in Japanese infants was comparable to that observed 
in US infants. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  partly  endorsed  for  this  study.  The  adverse 
events profile are not considered comparable between the two studies, as there are several differences 
in incidences of local and systemic adverse events between the two studies. Whether they are due to 
the route of administration, other concomitant vaccines or other reasons is not clear.  
The  reasons  for  the  higher  immune  responses  in  the  Japanese  study  were  discussed  in  the  clinical 
study  report.  There  are  several  possible  reasons  for  these  results,  e.g.  the  SC  route,the  age  at 
vaccination,the  lack  of  concomitant  vaccinations  or  among  others.  Considering  the  many  differences 
between the studies it is difficult to conclude on the reason for the differing safety and immunogenicity 
results.  
Study  6096A1-3008:  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Doubleblind  Trial  Evaluating  the 
Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  a  13-valent  Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy 
Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Canada 
  Description 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
The primary objectives of this study were as follows: 
 
To  demonstrate  that  the  immune  response  induced  by  NeisVac-C  given  with  13vPnC  is  non-
inferior  to  the  immune  response  induced  by  NeisVac-C  given  with  7vPnC,  when  measured  1 
month after the 2-dose NeisVac-C infant series. The immune response to the meningococcal C 
antigen in NeisVac-C was assessed using a serum bactericidal assay (SBA). 
To demonstrate that the immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 13vPnC are non-inferior to 
the  immune  responses  induced  by  Pentacel  given  with  7vPnC,  when  measured  1  month  after  the  3-
dose infant series. The immune responses to the following antigens in Pentacel were assessed: Hib and 
pertussis  antigens  (pertussis  toxoid  [PT],  filamentous  hemagglutinin  [FHA],  pertactin  [PRN],  and 
fimbrial agglutinogens [FIM]).  Immune responses to diphtheria, tetanus, and poliovirus antigens were 
not assessed in this study. 
The 13vPnC immunogenicity objectives were as follows: 
 
 
To assess the immune response to 13vPnC 1 month after a 3-dose infant series, as measured 
by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. 
To  assess  the  immune  response  to  13vPnC  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose,  as  measured  by 
serum IgG levels. 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
 
 
To  assess  the  immune  response  induced  by  NeisVac-C  given  with  13vPnC  relative  to  the 
immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC, when measured 1  month after the 
toddler  dose.  Immune  response  to  the  meningococcal  C  antigen  in  NeisVac-C  was  assessed 
using an SBA. 
To assess the immune response induced by Pentacel given with 13vPnC relative to the immune 
response induced by Pentacel given with 7vPnC at an alternative cutoff level, when measured 1 
month after the infant series. Immune response to the Hib antigen in Pentacel was assessed.

The safety objective of this study was as follows: 
 
To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of the 13vPnC, as measured by the incidence 
rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs). 
  Study design 
This was a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 13vPnC compared with 7vPnC in healthy infants. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately  570  subjects  (285  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to 
achieve  241  evaluable  subjects  per  group  at  approximately  12  sites.  Subjects  were  to  be  randomly 
assigned (in a 1:1 ratio prospectively) to receive 13vPnC plus routine pediatric vaccines or 7vPnC plus 
routine pediatric vaccines. 
 
Treatments 
Each  subject  was  to  receive  1  dose  (0.5  mL)  of  either  13vPnC  or  7vPnC  together  with  at  least  1 
concomitant  dose  of  a  routine  pediatric  vaccine  at  each  of  the  4  vaccination  visits.  Standard 
vaccination  practices  were  observed,  and  appropriate  resuscitative  equipment  was  available  in  the 
event  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction.  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  were  to  be  administered  by  intramuscular 
injection into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at 2, 4, and 6 months (infant series) and 12 
months of age (toddler dose). 
The following routine pediatric vaccines were given: Pentacel using a 2-, 4-, and 6-month infant series; 
NeisVac-C using a 2- and 6-month infant series followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age; and 
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines at 12 months of age.  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Blood samples were to be obtained 1 month after the third 7vPnC or 13vPnC dose of the infant series 
(visit  4,  at  approximately  7  months  of  age)  and  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  (visit  6,  at 
approximately 13 months of age). Samples obtained after the infant series and toddler dose were to be 
tested for IgG antibodies against the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19A, 19F, and 23F) present in 13vPnC in subjects receiving 13vPnC. Antibody responses to NeisVac-C 
and  to  selected  antigens  in  Pentacel  (Hib  and  pertussis  antigens  PT,  FHA,  PRN,  and  FIM)  were  to  be 
measured  in  blood  samples  collected  from  all  subjects  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Antibody 
responses  to  NeisVac-C  were  to  be  measured  in  blood  samples  collected  from  all  subjects  1  month 
after the toddler dose.  
Antibody responses to the NeisVac-C antigens were to be measured in blood samples collected from all 
subjects 1 month after the 2-dose NeisVac-C infant series (visit 4, at approximately 7 months of age). 
In addition, antibody responses to the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM) in Pentacel were to 
be  measured  in  blood  samples  collected  from  all  subjects  1  month  after  the  third  dose  (visit  4,  at 
approximately 7 months of age). 
Parents/legal  guardians  were  asked  to  monitor  and record in  an  e-diary  the  subject’s  local  reactions, 
systemic  events,  and  use  of  antipyretic  medication  to  treat  and  prevent  symptoms  for  4  days  after 
each  vaccination.  Other  signs  and  symptoms  were to  be  recorded on  the e-diary  as  well  from  visit  1 
through  visit  4,  and  from  visit  5  to  visit  6;  the  e-diary  was  collected  at  visit  4,  returned  to  the 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) at visit 5, and collected for the final time at visit 6. 
AEs  were  to  be  collected  and  recorded  on  the  CRF  based  on  ancillary  information  on  the  e-diary, 
clinical  evaluation  during  a  study  visit,  and  verbal  questioning  of  the  parent  about  the  child’s  health 
since  the  last  visit.  AEs  were  to  be  collected  from  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  to  visit  4  and 
from  visit  5  to  visit  6.  All  SAEs  were  to  be  recorded  from  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  to  6 
months  after  the  last  study  vaccination.  At  visit  5,  any  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions 
since visit 4 were to be recorded. 
A  telephone  contact  was  to  be  made  6  months  after  the  last  study  vaccination  to  record  any  newly 
diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions,  hospitalizations,  SAEs,  and  other  reportable  information  that 
occurred since the last study visit.

  Statistical Methods 
For  the  pneumococcal  IgG  concentrations,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  antibody 
concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL was computed for each blood sample obtained from subjects in the 13vPnC 
group. 
Within  each  vaccine  group  and  for  each  concomitant  antigen  separately,  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving  at  least  a  prespecified  antibody  concentration  was  computed.  For  all  concomitant  vaccine 
antigens,  non-inferiority  was  declared  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  2-sided,  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in 
proportions was greater than –0.10. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The  number  of  subjects  planned  for  this  study  was  570,  with  285  in  each  vaccine  group.  Actual 
enrollment in the study was 603 subjects, who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio prospectively to 
either the 13vPnC group (n=300) or the 7vPnC group (n=303). In addition, 5 subjects were screened 
but  not  randomly  assigned;  consent  had  been  obtained  from  the  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  of  4  of 
these 5 subjects. 
All  603  randomly  assigned  subjects  (100%)  received  dose  1,  593  subjects  (98.3%)  received  dose  2, 
and 587 subjects (97.3%) received dose 3. Overall, 96.8% (96.0% to 97.7% by group) completed the 
infant series. A total of 584 subjects (96.8%) completed the infant series, with a similar percentage of 
subjects in each group completing the series: 293 (97.7%) in the  13vPnC group and 291 (96.0%) in 
the 7vPnC group. 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
The 2 vaccine groups were well balanced with  respect to sex, race, ethnicity, age at enrollment, and 
weight at enrollment. The proportion of male subjects was slightly higher in the 13vPnC group (52.3%) 
than in the 7vPnC group (49.8%). Most subjects were white (81.7%) and non-Hispanic and non-Latino 
(95.9%).  The  mean  age  (±standard  deviation  [SD])  at  enrollment  was  2.1  (±0.3)  months  and  the 
mean weight at enrollment was 5.4 (±0.8) kg.

Immunogenicity results 
Immune Response to Pneumococcal Antigens 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified Antibody Levels 
For the evaluable pneumococcal infant immunogenicity population, the proportions of responders after 
dose 3 of the infant series were all greater than 90.0% for each serotype common to both 13vPnC and 
7vPnC (Table 9-5). The proportion of responders was greater than 95.0% for each of the 6 additional 
serotypes unique to 13vPnC, except serotype 3 (79.6%) and serotype 5 (87.0%).

Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations 
GMCs of each serotype were measured 1 month  after the infant series, and were calculated for each 
serotype of the 13vPnC vaccine group. In  the  evaluable infant immunogenicity population, IgG GMCs 
were  1.00  μg/mL  or  greater  for  all  pneumococcal  serotypes  except  serotype  3  (0.63  μg/mL)  and 
serotype 5 (0.90 μg/mL) (Table 9-6). 
Concomitant Vaccine Immunogenicity 
The  immune  response  induced  by  NeisVac-C  given  with  13vPnC  was  shown  to  be  non-inferior  to  the 
immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC following the infant series and toddler dose. 
After the infant series, the proportion of responders was 96.8% for the 13vPnC group and 99.3% for 
the 7vPnC group. This non-inferiority conclusion was supported by the geometric mean  titers (GMTs) 
for meningococcal C serum bactericidal assay (SBA) antibodies, which were approximately 361 for the 
13vPnC group and 303 for the 7vPnC group. The ratio of GMTs (13vPnC to 7vPnC) was 1.19, and the 
lower  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  ratio  was  0.96,  meeting  the  non-inferiority 
criterion.  After  the  toddler  dose,  the  proportion  of  responders  was  100.0%  for  both  the  13vPnC  and 
7vPnC  groups.  This  non-inferiority  conclusion  was  supported  by  the  GMTs  for  meningococcal  C  SBA 
antibodies, which were approximately 1380 for the 13vPnC group and 1084 for the 7vPnC group. The 
ratio of GMTs (13vPnC to 7vPnC) was 1.27,  and  the lower limit of the 95% CI of the ratio was 1.08, 
meeting the non-inferiority criterion. 
The  immune  responses  induced  by  Pentacel  given with  13vPnC  were  shown  to  be  non-inferior  to  the 
immune  responses  induced  by  Pentacel  given  with  7vPnC  after  the  infant  series.  The  immune 
responses were very similar in the 2 vaccine groups for the specific antigens assessed (pertussis and 
Hib).  All  comparisons  of  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  prespecified  antibody  levels  for 
concomitant  vaccine  antigens  met  the  non-inferiority  criterion  for  the  4  pertussis  antigens  (pertussis 
toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], pertactin [PRN], and fimbrial agglutinogens [FIM]) and 
Hib.  When  Hib  was  assessed  at  the  higher  antibody  level  (≥1.0  μg/mL),  the  responses  were  also 
shown to be non-inferior. Similarly, when the pertussis antigen responses were assessed at the higher 
antibody  concentration  for  FHA  and  the  concentrations  achieved  by  95%  of  the  7vPnC  group,  non-
inferiority criteria were also met.  
GMTs and GMCs in the 2 groups were comparable for all antigens and were formally non-inferior using 
the 2-fold criterion for each of these antigens. The results for the infant series are summarised in Table 
9-3, the results of the toddler dose are not presented in this AR.

  Safety results 
Prompted Adverse Events 
Local Reactions 
The majority of local reactions were mild in severity after any dose. The incidence and severity of local 
reactions  at  the  pneumococcal  vaccine  injection  site  were  similar  for  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups. 
With  the  exception  of  significant  tenderness  (p=0.034)  after  dose  3  (3.8%  and  0.8%  in  the  13vPnC 
and  7vPnC  groups,  respectively),  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  2 
vaccine  groups  in  the  incidence  of  local  reactions  within  4  days  of  vaccination  after  any  dose. 
Significant tenderness was reported by fewer than 4.5% of subjects in either vaccine group following 
any  dose  in  the  infant  series  and  by  2.5%  or  fewer  subjects  in  either  vaccine  group  following  the 
toddler dose. No subjects reported severe induration or severe erythema at the injection site after any 
dose. 
Systemic Events 
The incidence of each type of systemic event was generally similar for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups 
after  each  dose.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  vaccine  groups  in  the 
incidence of any type of prompted systemic event following any dose, except for irritability, which had 
a higher incidence in the 13vPnC group (68.8%) than in the 7vPnC group (58.5%; p=0.023) after the 
toddler dose. 
Most occurrences of fever were mild and did not exceed 13.3% in the 13vPnC group and 12.2% in the 
7vPnC  group  following  any  dose.  The  incidence  of  moderate  fever  did  not  exceed  2.0%  and  1.4% 
among 13vPnC and 7vPnC recipients, respectively, after any dose. Severe fever (>40°C) was reported 
in 1 subject (0.5%) in the 7vPnC group. 
Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events 
During  the  infant  series,  spontaneously  reported  AEs  were  reported  for  76.3%  of  13vPnC  recipients 
and 75.9% of 7vPnC recipients. Most of the AEs were the types of conditions and symptoms expected 
in infants in this age  group. The types of  AEs reported  most  frequently  during the infant series were 
infections  (most  often  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  bronchiolitis); 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (mostly  diarrhea,  vomiting,  teething,  and  constipation);  general  disorders 
and  administration  site  conditions  (mostly  pyrexia,  irritability,  and  injection  site  erythema); 
respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (mostly nasal congestion, cough, and rhinorrhea); and 
skin  disorders  (mostly  eczema,  rash,  and  diaper  dermatitis).  Similar  events  were  reported  after  the 
toddler dose. 
AEs  that  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  study  vaccine  were  general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  (injection  site  erythema  and  irritability),  gastrointestinal  disorders

(diarrhea  and  vomiting),  and  infections  and  infestations  (nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection). 
A  total  of  35  SAEs  were  reported  for  25  subjects  who  received  13vPnC  and  20  SAEs  for  17  subjects 
who received 7vPnC. During the infant series, SAEs occurred in 5 subjects (8 events) vaccinated with 
13vPnC  and  in  5  subjects  (7  events)  vaccinated  with  7vPnC.  After  the  infant  series,  11  subjects 
reported 17 SAEs and 7 subjects reported 7 SAEs in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. Two 
(2) SAEs in 2 subjects were reported in each of the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups during the toddler dose. 
During the 6-month follow-up period, SAEs were reported for 7 subjects (8 SAEs) in the 13vPnC group 
and  3  subjects  (4  SAEs)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  Most  were  infections  and  infestations  that  required 
hospitalization  and  were  not  considered  related  to  study  vaccine.  One  (1)  subject  reported  a  related 
SAE of severe pyrexia after receiving the 13vPnC toddler dose. There were no deaths during the study. 
Five (5) subjects in the 7vPnC group withdrew from the study after dose 3 because of AEs (urticaria, 
febrile neutropenia, convulsion, febrile convulsion, and movement disorder). 
Conclusions of the MAH: 
13vPnC may be given safely in a 3-dose infant series, administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with 
concomitant  NeisVac-C  and  Pentacel.  The  immunogenicity  of  the  meningococcal  group  C,  Hib,  and 
pertussis  components  of  these  vaccines  was  not  adversely  affected  by  concomitant  administration  of 
13vPnC.  The  13vPnC  was  immunogenic  with  substantial  responses  seen  to  all  13  serotypes  after  the 
infant series. The safety analysis of infant series data showed that most local reactions and systemic 
events  were  mild,  and  no  clinically  important  differences  between  vaccine  groups  were  noted  for  the 
prompted symptoms or unsolicited AEs. Although not formally tested, no increase in local or systemic 
AEs  was  seen  in  this  study  from  dose  1  to  dose  2  to  dose  3.  For  most  events,  the  proportion  of 
reported AEs actually tended to decrease with subsequent doses. These results indicate that the safety 
profile of 13vPnC is similar to that of 7vPnC, the standard of care for infants and young children. 
13vPnC  administered  with  concomitant  vaccines  in  this  study  in  Canadian  children  demonstrated  a 
comparable  safety  profile  to  7vPnC  and  good  immunogenicity  for  all  pneumococcal  and  concomitant 
vaccine antigens studied. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH overall conclusions: 
Subcutaneous  administration  of  13vPnC  in  study  3003  elicited  strong  IgG  responses  to  all  13 
pneumococcal conjugate serotypes after the infant series and toddler dose. When compared with study 
004,  the  antibody  responses  were  generally  higher  in  study  3003.  The  higher  immune  responses  in 
study  3003  may  be  due  to  ethnic  differences  in  response  to  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccination. 
Studies  with  Prevenar  given  subcutaneously  in  Japan  and  intramuscularly  in  other  Asian  populations 
have also shown a high immune response. Pneumococcal immunogenicity results from study 3008 with 
IM administration of 13vPnC also indicate a strong IgG response to all 13 serotypes following the infant 
series and toddler dose in the 13vPnC group. 
Concomitant  vaccine  immunogenicity  data  from  study  3008  show  that  the  responses  elicited  by 
NeisVac-C given with 13vPnC are non-inferior to those elicited by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC using a 
2- and 6-month infant series followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age. The immune responses 
to  pertussis  and  Hib  antigens  induced  by  Pentacel  given  with  13vPnC  were  also  shown  to  be  non-
inferior to the immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 7vPnC after the 2-, 4-, and 6-month 
infant series. 
Overall, safety and tolerability in study 3003 was acceptable. The incidence of local  reactions differed 
markedly between subjects vaccinated SC in study 3003 and subjects vaccinated IM in study 004. The 
difference  in  local  reactions  is  likely  due  to  the  different  route  of  administration.  The  incidence  of 
systemic events was either similar to or lower in study 3003 compared with study 004. 
Safety data from study 3008 demonstrate similar rates of local reactions and systemic events among 
13vPnC  and  7vPnC  recipients.  The  rates  and  nature  of  SAEs  and  other  AEs  associated  with  13vPnC 
were similar to those associated with 7vPnC. The safety profile of 13vPnC was shown to be comparable 
with  that  of  7vPnC  and  the  frequency  of  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  has  not  changed  compared 
with the frequency reported in the MAA. 
The  data  presented  in this  Article 46  submission  package  do  not  alter  the benefit-risk  assessment  of 
13vPnC; therefore, no further regulatory action is required at this time with respect to the marketing 
authorization for Prevenar 13.

Assessor’s  comment:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  generally  endorsed,  except  that  the  safety 
results  of  the  Japanese  study  and  the  US  study  are  not  considered  comparable.  The  Japanese  study 
provides data on SC administration of Prevenar 13, which has not been used previously in other clinical 
studies.  This 
for  prescribers  when  vaccinating  children  with 
thrombocytopaenia  or  any  coagulation  disorder  that  would  contraindicate  intramuscular  injection. 
Therefore, we do not agree that no further regulatory action is required, and the MAH should submit a 
variation to include a statement on subcutaneous administration.  
information  can  be  useful 
III. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Immunogenicity: The conclusions of the MAH are generally endorsed. The Immunogenicity results from 
the two submitted studies are in agreement with previously submitted studies.  
Safety: The conclusions of the MAH are generally endorsed. The safety results from the two submitted 
studies are in agreement with previously submitted studies.  
However,  we  do  not  agree  with  the  MAH  that  no  further  regulatory  action  is  needed.  The  Japanese 
study provides data on SC administration of Prevenar 13, which has not been used previously in other 
clinical  studies.  This  information  can  be  useful  for  prescribers  when  vaccinating  children  with 
thrombocytopaenia  or  any  coagulation  disorder  that  would  contraindicate  intramuscular  injection. 
Therfore the MAH should submit a variation to include a statement on subcutaneous administration.  
Update 2010-05-11 
One  comment  from  a  MS  was  received  not  supporting  the  demand  for  a  type  II  variation.  The 
Rapporteur does not agree with the MS comment. Since information is available from SC vaccination of 
children  this  could  be  valuable  for  the  prescriber.  However,  the  Rapporteur  does  agree  that  it  is  not 
possible  to  state  that  the  immune  responses  are  in  any  way  superior  to  IM  vaccination,  considering 
that  the  data  are  not  entirely  comparable  due  to  the  many  differences  between  the  studies.  The 
Rapporteur  suggests  a statement  in  the  SPC  that  the  vaccine  has  been  given  SC  without  safety  or 
immunogenicity concerns.

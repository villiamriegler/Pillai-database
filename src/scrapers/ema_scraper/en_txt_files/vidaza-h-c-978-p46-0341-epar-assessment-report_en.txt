1.  Introduction 
On 25 November 2019 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Vidaza (azacitidine), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
In addition to the study report a short critical expert overview has been provided. The cover letter 
stated that the MAH is currently assessing whether to submit a subsequent type II variation to update 
the SmPC (sections 5.1, 5.2 and 4.8) with information from the JMML arm of this study.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the Phase 2, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety and activity of azacitidine and to compare azacitidine to historical controls 
in paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukaemia before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, AZA-JMM-001 is a stand-
alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Azacitidine was supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder containing 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg of 
mannitol per vial. This is the same pharmaceutical formulation that is approved for adults in the EU for 
subcutaneous administration. 
An alternate administration route, IV administration, has been used in this study. Reconstitution for 
clinical IV administration is conducted at the hospital and is supported by a simplified Investigational 
Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD, version 2.0, dated May 2015) that includes relevant compatibility and 
in-use stability data. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Vidaza (azacitidine, EU/H/C/000978) is approved in the European Union (EU) since 17 December 2008 
as a powder for suspension for injection for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with: 
• 
• 
• 
intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPPS), 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without 
myeloproliferative disorder, 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to 
World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, 
•  AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. 
Vidaza (azacitidine) does not fall under requirements of Article 8 of the Paediatric Regulation, 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

A voluntary Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) was approved by the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) on 21 February 2014 (EMEA-001272-PIP02-13, Decision P/0031/2014) including two clinical 
studies: 
•  AZA-AML-004, Phase 2 study in children and young adults with AML in molecular relapse after 
first complete remission 
•  AZA-JMML-001, Phase 2 study in paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed advanced MDS or 
JMML before HSCT 
The PIP was modified once with modification EMEA-001272-PIP02-13-M01 approved on 02 October 
2015. On 19 June 2017, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) notified EMA of the discontinuation 
of the PIP for commercial reasons. 
This procedure concerns the submission of the final results of study AZA-JMML-001 involving paediatric 
patients in accordance with Article 46 of the paediatric regulation. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
Study AZA-JMML-001: A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety and activity of azacitidine and to compare azacitidine to historical controls 
in paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukaemia before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Description 
Study AZA-JMML-001 was an international, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine as monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric subjects 
with newly diagnosed advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic 
leukaemia (JMML) before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
Subjects were treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 (IV or SC), QD on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a 
minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles. The aim of treatment was to reduce the disease 
burden with minimal toxicity in order to improve efficacy of stem cell transplantation and thus overall 
survival (OS). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of azacitidine on confirmed 
response rate at Cycle 3 Day 28, and to compare against standard therapy using a matched-pairs 
analysis with historical data. 
CHMP comment 
Note that all patients were expected/intended to proceed to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) following azacitidine treatment during the follow up period (at least 28 days after last 
azacitidine treatment).  
No information on recommended or used HSCT procedure (e.g. conditioning regimen, stem cell donor) 
seem to be provided in the protocol or study report.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective is to assess the treatment effect on response rate (MDS: CR, partial response 
[PR], or marrow CR; JMML: either cCR or cPR) at Cycle 3 Day 28 and to compare against standard 
therapy using a matched-pairs analysis with historical data. 
Secondary objectives are to further evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of azacitidine in this subject population. 
Study design 
This was a prospective, open-label, Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, PD, PK, and safety 
of azacitidine administered in paediatric subjects enrolled in 2 parallel experimental arms, one for each 
disease indication: newly diagnosed advanced MDS and newly diagnosed JMML (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1 Overall study design of study AZA-JMML-001 
Study population /Sample size 
The study will enrol paediatric children aged 1 month to less than 18 years with newly diagnosed 
advanced MDS or JMML. 
For MDS, diagnosis was to be confirmed within 14 days prior signature as refractive anaemia with 
excess blasts (REAB) (2-19% blast in PB or 5-19% blast in BM), REAB-t (20-29% blast in PB or BM), 
or secondary MDS presenting as CMML without increase in blasts but with chromosomal abnormality. 
For JMML, diagnosis was to be confirmed within 14 days prior signature with a somatic mutation in 
PTPN11, KRAS, or NRAS and HbF % > 5x normal value for age, or by clinical diagnosis of 
neurofibromatosis type 1 or NF-1 mutation. Subjects were required to have splenomegaly and less 
than 20% blast in PB and BM. Subjects with germline molecular aberrations in CBL, PTPN11, NRAS, or 
KRAS were excluded.

Each arm was designed based on Simon’s Optimal 2-stage study design. The sample size was 
calculated to allow evaluation of the confirmed response rate after 3 cycles of treatment in each of the 
2 disease indications. Twenty subjects with MDS and 35 JMML subjects evaluable for the primary 
endpoint (i.e., subjects that received at least 1 dose of IP) were to be enrolled at approximately 45 
centers in Europe. If, during Stage 1 evaluation, less than 2 subjects are observed with CR, PR or 
marrow CR after 3 cycles of azacitidine in the first 9 subjects with MDS then enrollment will be 
stopped. Similarly, if less than 3 subjects are observed with cPR or cCR after 3 cycles of azacitidine in 
the first 18 subjects with JMML, then enrollment will be stopped. 
Treatments 
Subjects were to be treated with azacitidine, 75 mg/m2, IV or SC, QD on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle 
for a minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles, provided that the subject does not have disease 
progression (based on an independent central review of responses). Intravenous administration was 
the preferred route. The SC route of administration was only to be used in situations where it was not 
clinically possible to administer azacitidine through IV (e.g., central venous line complications, etc). 
All supportive care was permitted. 
CHMP comments: 
The azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2 was chosen in order to provide efficacy but minimal toxicity in both 
the MDS and JMML patient populations. This is the same starting dose as recommended for the 
approved (adult) indication. This starting dose was agreed upon with the PDCO. 
While not specified in the description of study treatment, all patients were expected to proceed to 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following azacitidine treatment, irrespective of the 
treatment effect of azacitidine. Which is supported as HSCT is the only curative treatment option for 
patients with AML and JMML. However, this significantly hampers the interpretability of the clinical 
relevance of a treatment effect. While an anti-tumour effect may be noted in terms of reduction in 
disease burden, the added value thereof on clinically relevant outcome measures such as OS or LFS 
cannot be estimated as this is confounded by HSCT, and while it is intuitively appealing to assume that 
a reduced tumour burden will increase the curative success of HSCT, this has currently not been shown 
for (paediatric) patients wilt AML or JMML. 
Importantly, as a control arm is lacking in the study design and thus the interpretation of the potential 
effect of azacitidine treatment prior to HSCT on OS or LFS need to rely on extrapolation form adults 
(for AML only, JMML is a childhood disease) and/or on cross study comparisons. 
To contextualise the results, a comparison with a historical control group collected from the EWOG-
MDS registry by means of a matched-pairs analysis was envisaged in the study protocol. 
All subjects received azacitidine from Cycles 1 through 3; however, if by the beginning of Cycle 3, the 
conditions below are met, the subject could receive up to 3 additional cycles (Cycles 4 through 6) of IP 
75 mg/m2 QD, IV or SC, for 7 days of a 28-day cycle, at the investigator’s discretion: 
• 
• 
an MDS subject was in PR, CR, or marrow CR based on central review of responses as 
determined by the independent external expert or 
a JMML subject was in cCR or cPR based on central review of responses as determined by the 
independent external expert.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/424590/2020  
Page 6/35 
 
 
 
For MDS or JMML subjects who did not meet the above criteria by the beginning of Cycle 3, the 
decision regarding the additional 3 cycles of treatment was to be based on central review of the Cycle 
3 Day 28 assessments.  
If central review by the independent external expert determined that an MDS or JMML subject had 
stable disease or disease progression at the Cycle 3 Day 28 visit, the subject was to be discontinued 
and treated as per the institution’s standard of care. If at any point during Cycles 4 through 6 a subject 
experienced disease progression, as per the central review, the subject was to be discontinued. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the response rate at Cycle 3 Day 28, defined as: 
•  MDS: Proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or marrow CR according to modified IWG Response 
criteria (based on Table 3 in Cheson, 2006), adapted to paediatric reference values at 3 
months (Cycle 3, Day 28). Response must have been sustained for at least 4 weeks either in 
the 4-week period preceding or succeeding Cycle 3 Day 28 (ie, sustained over the period Cycle 
2 Day 28 to Cycle 3 Day 28, or Cycle 3 Day 28 to Cycle 4 Day 28). 
• 
JMML: Proportion of subjects with sustained cCR or cPR according to the International JMML 
response criteria in Niemeyer 2015 at 3 months (Cycle 3 Day 28). Response must have been 
sustained for at least 4 weeks either in the 4-week period preceding or succeeding Cycle 3 Day 
28 (i.e., sustained over the period Cycle 2 Day 28 to Cycle 3 Day 28, or Cycle 3 Day 28 to 
Cycle 4 Day 28). 
Furthermore, as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint in the JMML cohort, the response 
assessment at Cycle 3 Day 28 will be assessed according to the updated response assessment criteria 
(Niemeyer, 2018). 
Secondary endpoints were  
•  Cytogenetic response for MDS subjects; cytogenetic and molecular response for JMML subjects 
•  Duration of response (DoR) 
• 
Time to response (TTR) 
• 
• 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation status in BM on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, Day 28 of Cycle 
Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) 
Time to progression (TTP) 
3, pre-HSCT, and at the time of relapse/progression 
Time to first HSCT

Pharmacokinetics. (Sampling was to be done for all subjects on Days 5, 6, and 7 of Cycle 1. 
The Primary and Safety Population (defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of azacitidine) 
was used for analysis of the primary endpoint for each disease indication as well as all safety 
endpoints. 
The Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population, defined as all subjects enrolled into the study regardless of 
whether or not they received any dose of azacitidine, was used for the analysis of all efficacy-based 
secondary endpoints and for listings. 
The PK population consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of azacitidine and had at least 
1 measurable concentration of azacitidine. In patients weighing ≤20 kg, blood samples were taken ≤1

hour prior to dosing in cycle 1 day 5, and cycle 1 day 6, as well as 5 (in case of IV only), 15 (in case of 
SC only), 30 min, 1, 4 and 6 hours post-dose at day 7. In patients weighing >20 kg, and pre-dose and 
at 5 (in case of IV only), 15 (in case of SC only), 30 min, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-dose at day 7. 
CHMP comment: 
The primary endpoint is suitable to the aim of treatment, i.e. to establish preliminary activity of 
azacitidine in subjects with either newly diagnosed advanced MDS or JMML. Indeed response rates are 
informative regarding the activity of azacitidine against MDS and JMML, however, as noted above, the 
clinical relevance of such a response is difficult to estimate as subjects were expected to proceed to 
HSCT (irrespective of a response to azacitidine treatment). 
Statistical Methods 
Each experimental arm is independent of the other and will run in parallel to each other. Each 
experimental arm employs Simon’s 2-stage design to assess the response rate (CR, PR or marrow CR 
[MDS] and cCR or cPR [JMML]), at Cycle 3 Day 28. Each arm will then be compared to a historical 
control arm in a matched-pairs analysis using historical data retrospectively collected from the EWOG 
registry. 
•  Advanced MDS subjects will be matched (1:1) by BM blast count (5% to 19%, 20% to 29%), 
and type of MDS (primary MDS, secondary MDS). Whether a meaningful matched-pair analysis 
can be completed will depend in part on the characteristics of MDS subjects included in the 
study. 
• 
Each JMML subject in the study will be matched with 2 subjects (1:2, experimental:control). 
Pairs will be matched for the clinical risk factors age (< 2 years, ≥ 2 years) and platelet count 
(< 40,000 and ≥ 40,000/μL) at the time of diagnosis. These risk factors were chosen based on 
previous report (Niemeyer, 1997). HbF, another known risk factor, will not be utilized since it is 
dependent on karyotype and, at least in some studies, also on age. In JMML, there is currently 
no evidence that karyotype (normal versus monosomy 7) or mutational subtype (NF-1, 
somatic mutations in PTPN11, NRAS or KRAS) have prognostic value. 
Specific disease indication historical control data will not be collected nor considered for analysis if the 
related experimental arm does not continue past Stage 1 (the interim analysis). 
For MDS a lower and upper boundaries of interest in the response rate (CR, PR, or marrow CR) were 
10% and 40% respectively. For JMML the lower and upper boundaries of interest in response rate (cCR 
or cPR) were 10 and 30%. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
As of the cut-off date of 13 Mar 2019, a total of 34 subjects (12 in the MDS arm and 22 in the JMML 
arm) had been screened and 6 subjects (2 in the MDS arm and 4 in the JMML arm) had failed 
screening (see Table 1), mainly due to not meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, 28 subjects were 
enrolled by 18 activated investigational sites from 10 European countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland).

Data analyses 
Each experimental arm had one interim analysis for futility planned (at the end of Stage 1). 
For the MDS experimental arm, the interim analysis was conducted once the first 9 subjects eligible for 
the primary analysis had completed Cycle 3 Day 28. As fewer than 2 subjects had a response (either 
CR, PR, or marrow CR) at the time of the interim analysis, the MDS arm was closed to enrollment after 
Stage 1 completion. Note: 10 subjects were enrolled as the tenth subject was screened prior to the 
decision being made. 
For the JMML experimental arm, the interim analysis was conducted once the first 18 subjects eligible 
for the primary analysis had completed Cycle 3 Day 28. The JMML arm was closed to enrollment after 
Stage 1 completion due to the threshold for confirmed response for the whole study (Stage 1 plus 
Stage 2) (i.e., 7 of 35 responders) being met in Stage 1 alone with 9 subjects achieving a confirmed 
clinical response. 
At the time of DCO (17 Mar 2019) 17 subjects (9 in the MDS arm, 8 in the JMML arm) completed the 
Follow-up Period, and 8 JMML subjects were still continuing in the Follow-up Period. Overall, 3 subjects 
(1 in the MDS arm, 2 in the JMML arm) discontinued the study due to death.  
CHMP comment: 
It is noted that for both study arms enrolment was closed after stage 1 of the study; for MDS 
enrolment was closed due to lack of success, while for JMML enrolment was closed because the 
criterion for success (i.e. the threshold for confirmed response) was already met after Stage 1. 
Study conduct 
The original protocol (dated 11 Sep 2014) was amended 3 times (18 Dec 2014, 13 May 2015 and 07 
Aug 2018. The first two amendments are dated prior to first subject first visit (03 Sep 2015). With the 
third protocol amendment the long-term follow-up was reduced to 1 year from the last dose of 
azacitidine instead of 2 years. With this amendment it was also clarified that as the matched-pairs 
analysis was not viable due to a lack of key data critical to establish pairing of subject which was 
central to the analysis, other methodologies were explored to allow evaluation of response rates which 
were either reported in available literature or identified in patient registry database(s). 
For the MDS and JMML arms, 10 subjects (100%) and 17 subjects (94.4%), respectively, had at least 
1 protocol deviation during the study, and 8 subjects (80.0%) and 8 subjects (44.4%) for the MDS and 
JMML arms, respectively, had at least 1 protocol violation. The most common protocol deviation

categories were “procedures or assessments not done”, the most common protocol violation categories 
were “IP issues” (e.g. timing of administration, dose calculation, given outside of window of 45 minutes 
following reconstitution). 
The protocol deviations and violations were not considered to have any clinically relevant impact on 
data integrity or subject safety by the Sponsor. 
CHMP comment 
While the number of protocol deviations/violations seems rather high, it is agreed that the impact of 
these deviations/violations on subject safety is limited. In case this study would be used for an 
extension of indication, clarification on the number of protocol deviations/violations should be 
provided.   
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline (disease) characteristics are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

CHMP comment: 
While patient numbers are limited, the studied population seems to be a reasonable representation of 
the general MDS and JMML paediatric patient population.  
Data on medical history at study entry and concomitant active conditions, prior and concomitant 
therapies and or procedures were collected. The reported concomitant medications were consistent 
with underlying disease of the subjects enrolled in the study. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Mean plasma concentrations of azacitidine on Day 7 for the PK Population of Study AZA-JMML-001 at a 
75 mg/m2 dose are summarized in Figure 2. Both in the paediatric MDS and JMML population, mean 
azacitidine plasma concentration-time profiles appeared well characterized over the 6-hour post-dose 
sampling interval. The plasma PK parameters following azacitidine administration are summarized in 
Table 4. 
As expected, azacitidine rapidly reached maximum plasma concentration within 0.083 hours (5 min) 
post IV administration in both MDS and JMML populations. Visual inspection of mean plasma 
concentrations of azacitidine time profiles following azacitidine administration suggested that 
azacitidine plasma exposures appeared to be similar between the MDS and JMML populations. The t½ 
were 0.4 and 0.3 hours, and the CL were 166.4 and 148.3 L/h for MDS and JMML, respectively (Table 
4). 
Following IV administration of azacitidine, the Cmax were 1797.5 and 1066.3 ng/mL, and the AUC0-t 
were 628.9 and 386.9 h∙ng/mL, for MDS and JMML subjects, respectively. The Vz were 103.9 and 61.1 
L for MDS and JMML subjects, respectively. It appeared that the total plasma exposure of azacitidine 
was higher in MDS subjects, however, moderate to high between-subject variability was noted for both 
AUC and Cmax (Table 4).

CHMP comment: 
Azacitidine rapidly reached maximum plasma concentration within 5 minutes post IV administration in 
both the MDS and JMML population. Visual inspection of mean plasma concentrations of azacitidine 
time profiles following azacitidine administration suggested that azacitidine plasma exposures are 
similar between the MDS and JMML populations, with only a trend for higher exposure in MDS patients. 
It is agreed with the Applicant that due the high variation in azacitidine PK and the low number of 
subjects, conclusions on potential differences in exposure between MDS and JMML patients should be 
taken with caution.  
Based on interstudy comparison, exposure to azacitidine in paediatric patients 0-17 following IV 
administration of a 75 mg/m2 dose appears in the same range as that in adults following IV 
administration of the same dose. Considering the high absolute bioavailability of 89%, exposure is 
expected to be also comparable to that obtained in adults after SC administration of a 75 mg/m2 dose. 
This comparable exposure is in support of IV use at a 75 mg/m2 dose in JMML. PK data in paediatric 
patients has been described in SmPC section 5.2. 
Biomarker correlation analysis 
Azacitidine incorporates into both DNA and RNA resulting in cellular differentiation, arrest, and/or 
cytotoxicity and inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to DNA hypomethylation, which was 
utilized as a key pharmacodynamic (PD) marker of azacitidine activity. Bone marrow (BM) genomic 
DNA methylation was to be analysed across all time points for both the JMML and MDS disease 
indications. However due to discontinuation of the MDS arm because of futility, biomarkers were not 
analysed for this population.  
The PD effects of azacitidine on DNA methylation in JMML subjects were investigated by computing: 
(1) the methylation levels of all CpG probes that were highly methylated at baseline; (2) the number 
of highly methylated CpG probes across all time points; and (3) the JMML-specific DNA methylation 
score derived from differentially methylated probes (JMML DMPs), across all time points (Lipka, 2017). 
At baseline, JMML subjects exhibited varied BM DNA methylation levels. Azacitidine treatment led to 
reductions in DNA methylation in all 18 JMML subjects (see Figure 3). Recovery of methylation to near-
baseline levels occurred at Cycle 3 Day 28, during the period of drug withdrawal (Cycle 3 Day 28 and 
pre-HSCT). 
PK-PD analysis suggests that there is no apparent correlation between exposure (Cmax and AUC) and 
PD readouts (Global DNA methylation scores, JMML-specific DMP scores, or the number of 
hypermethylated sites).  
DNA methylation changes appeared to be similar between responder and nonresponder subsets at 
Cycle 3 Day 28 (versus Cycle 1 Day 1; Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA and Dunn’s test; p < 0.05; not 
significant). No statistically significant association was observed between the high methylation class 
compared to the intermediate methylation class on confirmed response at Cycle 3 Day 28; however, a 
statistically significant association was observed against the low and intermediate JMML methylation 
classes (Fisher’s exact test for association, p = 0.049).  
No association was observed between the various DNA methylation readouts at baseline with TTR, TTP, 
or LFS.

Figure 3 Pharmacodynamic Reductions in DNA Methylation with Azacitidine Treatment in JMML Subjects 
CHMP comment: 
The fact that a reduction in methylation was seen in all treated JMML subjects indicates that azacitidine 
was pharmacodynamically active in all treated subjects. No relationship between exposure and change 
in methylation was noted. This might suggest that saturation of the PD effect occurred, assuming that 
the PD effect is exposure dependent. However the accuracy of this assumption is not  known. 
In any case it is not expected that increasing the dose would lead to an increase in clinical response. 
Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
For MDS subjects, there were no confirmed response based on central review (confirmed response rate 
of 0% [95% CI = 0.0, 30.8])(see Table 5). No subjects achieved a CR or PR, but 1 subject (10.0%) 
achieved a marrow CR (finding not confirmed) and 3 MDS subjects had a missing unconfirmed 
hematologic response (but were discontinued prior to Cycle 3 Day 28).

Table 5 Central review response rate for subjects with MDS at cycle 3 day 28 
For JMML subjects, there were a total of 11 subjects with clinical response at Cycle 3 Day 28 (4 
subjects [22.2%] with cCR and 7 subjects [38.9%] with cPR) (see Table 6). Of these 11 subjects, 9 
(50%) subjects had a confirmed clinical response (3 subjects with cCR and 6 subjects with cPR). The 2 
JMML subjects who had a missing unconfirmed haematologic response were discontinued prior to Cycle 
3 Day 28.

Table 6 Central review response rate for subjects with JMML at cycle 3 day 28. 
Similar findings were noted for the PP Population. 
As a sensitivity analysis for JMML only, the response assessment at Cycle 3 Day 28 was to be assessed 
according to the updated response assessment criteria. Based on these updated response criteria all 
11 (61.1%) subjects were considered partial responders. 
The characteristics of the responder (N = 11) and non-responder (N = 7) JMML subjects at Cycle 3 Day 
28 are provided in Table 6 and Table 7. The responder subjects are in the lower ages (from 0.2 to 4.7 
years old). All the subjects with low or intermediate methylation (LM and IM) class and 4 subjects with 
high methylation (HM) class had clinical response. Subjects with unfavourable prognosis, such as 
subjects with PTPN11 mutation and HM status, responded to azacitidine treatment. Subjects who 
progressed at Cycle 3 Day 28 had unfavourable prognosis: they are in the higher ages (from 1.8 to 6.9 
years old), most of them had PTPN11 mutation, and all had HM status.

No statistically significant association was observed between the HM class compared to the IM class on 
confirmed response at Cycle 3 Day 28; however, a statistically significant association was observed 
against the IM+LM classes (Fisher’s exact test for association, p = 0.049).

CHMP comment: 
Methylation status is a prognostic factor for JMML, with high methylation indicting a worst prognosis. It 
is noted that while azacitidine is a demethylating agent, all non-responding subjects had a high 
methylation status.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, the median follow-up time for the MDS subjects was 25.7 
months (range: 24.9 to 29.5 months), while the median follow-up time for the JMML subjects was 22.7 
months (range: 14.0 to 30.5 months) 
MDS group (n=10 subjects) 
One (1) subject (10.0%) experienced a response with a median time to response (TTR) of 2.76 
months, the duration of response, with censoring for HSCT, could not be estimated. The cytogenetic 
response rate was 10.0% (1 subject) (see Table 4).  
The median time to progression (TTP) with censoring for HSCT was 0.97 months (95% CI = 0.95, 
2.04) with 9 subjects (90.0%) having disease progression or death due to progression with censoring 
for HSCT. The median LFS time could not be estimated. The leukemia free survival (LFS) rate at 6 
months post HSCT, 12 months post HSCT, and at time of analysis was 100.0%, 100.0%, and 80.0%, 
respectively. One (1) subject died during FU. 
All 10 MDS subjects received HSCTs, the median time to HSCT was 3.76 months (95% CI = 2.79, 
4.73). All 10 subjects (100%) had at least 1 transfusion (both RBC and platelet) during the study with 
a median number of 19.0 transfusions (range: 7 to 101). Prior to dosing, 6 subjects (60.0%) had at 
least 1 infusion with a median number of 6.0 transfusions (range: 4 to 17) and after dosing prior to 
HSCT, 7 subjects (70.0%) had at least 1 infusion with a median number of 7.0 transfusions (range: 1 
to 92). 
CHMP comment 
It is noted that the one subject with a (non-confirmed) response had also a cytogenetic response. 
While most patients had progressive disease at the time of HSCT, LFS after HSCT was 100% at 12 
months following HSCT signifying the curative effect of transplantation.  
JMML group (n=18 subjects) 
Twelve (12) subjects (66.7%) experienced a response during the treatment period prior to transplant 
with a median TTR duration of 1.20 months (95% CI = 0.95, 1.87). A median duration of response 
could not be estimated. The genetic and molecular responses were noted in 2 subjects (11.1%), both 
clinical responders)(see Table 6). 
The median TTP could not be estimated, with 8 subjects (44.4%) having disease progression with 
censoring for HSCT. The median LFS time (ITT Population) could not be estimated. The LFS rate at 6 
months post HSCT, 12 months post HSCT, and at time of analysis was 87.8%, 81.6%, and 81.6%, 
respectively. Two subjects died during FU. The OS rate at 6 months, 12 months, and at time of 
analysis was 94.4%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. 
17 JMML subjects received HSCTs, the median time to HSCT was 4.63 months (95% CI = 3.91, 6.77). 
All 18 subjects (100%) had at least 1 transfusion (17 subjects had both RBC and platelet) during the 
study with a median number of 14.5 transfusions (range: 1 to 162). Prior to dosing, 15 subjects 
(83.3%) had at least 1 infusion with a median number of 3.0 transfusions (range: 1 to 18) and after

dosing prior to HSCT, 4 subjects (22.2%) had at least 1 infusion with a median number of 20.5 
transfusions (range: 3 to 37). 
CHMP comments: 
Most time dependent endpoints are difficult to interpret because of the HSCT following treatment. It is 
noted that time to response is generally rapid and occurs within the first two cycles (so if a patient 
does not respond after 2 cycles it is likely that the patient will not respond at all).  
It is noted that while the responses to azacitidine were mostly partial responses, the vast majority of 
patients were leukaemia free following HSCT, demonstrating the anti-JMML effect of HSCT.  
The 2 deaths are due to disease progression and sepsis (see safety section). 
In the study report for the secondary endpoint of time to response it is stated that 12 subjects 
experienced a response during treatment, while for the primary endpoints 11 subjects were stated to 
have a response of which 9 were confirmed. This discrepancy in patient numbers has not been 
explained. Possibly 1 additional patient experienced a response but not on the time point for the 
primary endpoint (i.e. Cycle 3 Day 28). In case this study would be used for an extension of indication, 
clarification on this discrepancy should be provided.   
While 18 JMML subjects were treated with azacitidine, 17 received HSCT. In the study report it was not 
clearly stated why one JMML subject did not receive a HSCT. But again, clarification should be provided 
in case this study would be used as basis for an extension of the indication.  
Efficacy conclusions 
No response was confirmed in any MDS subject and only 1 subject (10.0%) achieved an unconfirmed 
marrow CR. These data indicated lack of efficacy in MDS subjects and the MDS arm was closed after 
Stage 1. The secondary efficacy endpoint of cytogenetic response to azacitidine was achieved by 1 
MDS subject (10.0%) with time to response 2.76 months. Median TTP (with censoring for HSCT) was 
0.97 months for 9 MDS subjects (90.0%). All MDS subjects underwent HSCT, one subject died during 
the study, all other subjects were censored at the time of the analysis. 
There was a total of 11 JMML subjects with clinical response at Cycle 3 Day 28 (4 subjects [22.2%] 
with cCR and 7 subjects [38.9%] with cPR). Of these 11 subjects, 9 (50%) subjects had a confirmed 
clinical response (3 cCR and 6 cPR). The median TTR was 1.20 months for 12 JMML subjects (66.7%). 
According to the Applicant, these results show that the azacitidine treatment prior to HSCT was 
effective in JMML and provided clinical benefit to subjects in this study. The secondary efficacy 
endpoint of genetic and molecular response to azacitidine was achieved by 2 JMML subjects (11.1%). 
Median time to progression data could not be estimated for JMML subjects when censored for HSCT. 
The proportion of subjects undergoing HSCT was 94.4% (n=17). 2 subjects (11.1%) in the JMML arm 
died during the study, and all other subjects were censored at the time of the analysis. 
CHMP comments: 
Data on the effect of azacitidine in children with MDS are limited. Responses to treatment have been 
reported, but at a rather low frequency and not all authors have observed responses following 
azacitidine treatment (Waespe et al Haematologica 2016, Cseh et al BJH 2016, van Eijkelenburg EHA 
2019). In the current study only 1 non-confirmed clinical response was noted, albeit accompanied by a 
cytogenetic response. This indicates only limited activity of azacitidine in paediatric MDS. This seems 
particularly limited in relation to the effect of the subsequent HSCT on disease, where all subjects 
(initially) became disease free. Overall, the added value of treatment of azacitidine as a bridge to HSCT 
in children with MDS seems limited. As azacitidine was shown to slow progression to leukaemia in

adults with MDS, the limited activity in paediatric MDS is relevant information to the prescriber and this 
information is provided in the SmPC.  
Data on the effect of azacitidine in JMML in the public domain seems even more limited than for MDS. 
Case reports suggest activity of azacitidine against JMML. Indeed, the current study confirms that 
azacitidine is able to reduce disease burden in approximately 50% of newly diagnosed JMML patients. 
However, and as discussed above the clinical relevance of this finding is not clear. HSCT seems very 
efficacious in eliminating the disease (~90% was disease free following HSCT), and data to support the 
assumption that lower tumour burden prior to HSCT improves long term outcomes are limited to cross 
study comparison involving historical controls which is insufficient in this respect (see discussion 
below). Thus the uncertainty in the translation of anti-disease activity into clinical benefit impedes the 
possibility of balancing the risks against benefits of treatment as the benefits cannot be estimated. 
Furthermore, as JMML is a childhood disease extrapolation from adult data is not possible.  
As the observed activity of azacitidine in (paediatric) patients with JMML is of interest to the 
physicians, this information is provided in the SmPC.   
Comparison to historical controls 
In order to understand the survival benefit of azacitidine in the context of conventional therapies 
available for paediatric subjects with JMML, the AZA-JMML-001 efficacy data were to be compared 
retrospectively to data from subsets of patients from the EWOG-MDS registry that met the key 
eligibility criteria of the AZA-JMML-001 study.  
The objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy results from Study AZA-JMML-001 in 
subjects treated before HSCT with IP at 75 mg/m², QD on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle to JMML 
patients in the historical control arm by: 
1. Relativizing platelet transfusion independency and sustained platelet counts obtained in the AZA-
JMML-001 study to that observed in a cohort of patients untreated with azacitidine. For the purpose of 
this comparison, the primary endpoint was defined as proportion of subjects achieving self-sustained 
platelet count self-sustained pre-HSCT platelet count above a specified threshold (either 50, 100, or 
150 × 109/L), which was a surrogate marker for response. 
2. Relativizing OS and post-HSCT survival observed in the AZA-JMML-001 study to those observed in a 
cohort of patients untreated with azacitidine. 
In summary, the methodology consisted of: 
−  Mapping of the 2 groups of patients according to the 2 major prognostic factors: age at 
diagnosis of JMML and platelets level at diagnosis. 
− 
Identification of 2 matched subsets of patients with similar profiles according to the 2 major 
prognostic factors. 
−  The primary endpoint comparison was performed using Fisher’s exact test. 
−  Kaplan-Meier’s curves for OS and comparison using unstratified and stratified Cox’s model, 
both for the full patient set and for the matched subset. 
Patient selection and clinical characteristics of the historical control cohort are described in a separate 
study report (EWOG-MDS Study Report, March 2019).

Figure 4 Selection Criteria for JMML Patients From the EWOG-MDS Registry 
A total of 55 patients were selected for the comparison analysis according to the following criteria: 
canonical mutation in PTPN11, KRAS, NRAS, no azacitidine therapy, HSCT > 3 months from diagnosis, 
platelet count available at diagnosis and HSCT, and no NF-1 (see Figure 2). Thirty-two patients of the 
historical control cohort had received 6-mercaptopurine or other low-dose chemotherapy, 4 patients 
had been given AML therapy and 10 patients had not received any therapy prior to HSCT. Data for 
therapy were not available for 9 patients. 
Table 9 Clinical Characteristics of the Historical Control Cohort With Respect to JMML subtype 
After a median follow-up after diagnosis of 5.6 years (range: 0.6 to 17.9), 39 of the 55 patients are 
alive, resulting in a probability of 5-year OS of 0.68 (range: 0.55 to 0.81). The outcome from HSCT

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

resulted in a 5-year LFS of 0.57 (range: 0.43 to 0.71), while the cumulative incidence of non-relapse 
mortality and relapse were 0.11 (range, 0.05 to 0.23) and 0.32 (range, 0.22 to 0.48), respectively. 
The control cohort was further refined to exclude the subjects with age greater than 7 years and 
platelet count greater than 100 × 109/L from the analysis in order to limit the comparison to the same 
range of baseline characteristics of these 2 parameters in the AZA-JMML-001 cohort. This resulted in 
44 patients being selected from the historical control cohort to be used for the analysis. Eighteen 
subjects were treated with azacitidine in the AZA-JMML-001 study. Two subjects were excluded from 
the analysis of the surrogate endpoint for the comparison: 1 subject who expressed NF-1 mutation due 
to high platelet count at diagnosis based on the selection criteria and another subject due to death 
prior HSCT. This resulted in 16 subjects being selected from the AZA-JMML-001 study. 
A higher percentage of subjects required transfusion at diagnosis in the AZA-JMML-001 cohort 
compared to the historical control cohort (68.8% versus 11.4%, p < 0.0001). After treatment (pre-
HSCT), the percentage of subjects who required transfusion was lower in the AZA-JMML-001 cohort 
compared to the historical control cohort (43.8% of subjects versus 63.6%, p = 0.2375).

Cohort Versus Historical Control 
Table 11 Overall Survival Rate on the Matched Subsets of AZA-JMML-001 and Historical Control 
Cohorts 
Subjects in the AZA-JMML-001 study treated with azacitidine showed a clinical benefit with platelet 
responses compared to the matched historical cohort, with a lower percentage of subjects requiring 
transfusions at HSCT in the AZA-JMML-001 experimental arm (43.8%) versus the historical cohort 
(63.6%) and significantly higher number of subjects in AZA-MML-001 cohort with sustained platelet 
counts. 
Furthermore, subjects in the AZA-JMML-001 study treated with azacitidine appear to show more 
favourable survival than subjects from the historical control cohort, although confounding factors such 
as improvements in HSCT methods over time need to be taken into consideration.

CHMP comment: 
As noted above, the benefit of reducing the tumour burden in JMML prior to HSCT for long term 
outcomes cannot be determined based on study AZA-JMML-001 as an internal control is lacking and 
extrapolation from adults is not possible. To contextualise the results, the MAH has provided a 
comparison with an external historical control group based on the EWOG-MDS registry. This is much 
appreciated. The results of this comparison indicate that azacitidine may reduce transfusion 
requirements prior to HSCT. However whether this results in an improved success rate of HSCT is not 
clear. The comparison also suggest that azacitidine treatment prior to HSCT may result in a higher OS 
rate. However, it should be noted that this comparison is accompanied by significant uncertainties. It is 
based on a small number of patients with a heterogeneous disease who are matched for two 
prognostic factors only (age and platelet counts). In this comparison the death of one subject already 
changes the OS rate significantly, in particular in the JMML group. Furthermore, there are additional 
differences between the two cohorts, e.g. in the median duration of follow up (22 months vs > 5 
years) and the time of treatment which have not been accounted for in the comparison. Importantly, a 
significant number of subjects in the historical control group died of HSCT-related mortality (TRM), 
while no subject died due to TRM in the JMML cohort. This difference in TRM is most likely due to 
improved HSCT practices (recent studies indicate significant improvement of TRM in time) and not due 
to azacitidine treatment.  
In conclusion, given these uncertainties, it is not possible to conclude on whether azacitidine prior to 
HSCT improves survival outcome after HSCT. 
Of note, in this comparison it is stated that 7 JMML subjects who received azacitidine required 
transfusion prior to HSCT, however at the description of the study results it is stated that 4 required 
transfusion at the time of HSCT. This discrepancy need to be clarified in case this study would be used 
as basis for an extension of the indication.

Safety results 
Exposure to azacitidine is summarized in Table 8. 
Table 12 Treatment Exposure (Primary and Safety Population) 
For MDS subjects (N = 10), 8 subjects completed the 3 cycles as per protocol, 1 subject completed 2 
cycles and 1 subject did not complete Cycle 2. In addition to these two subject one additional subject 
subjects discontinued study treatment (after cycle 3). Reasons for discontinuations were physician 
decision (n=2) and AE (n=1). 
For JMML subjects (N = 18), 16 subjects completed treatment as per protocol (16 subjects completed 
3 cycles, and 5 subjects completed 6 cycles), 1 subject completed 1 cycle and 1 subject completed 2 
cycles. In addition to these 2 subjects one additional subject discontinued study treatment during the 
5th cycle. Reasons for discontinuations were disease progression (n=2) and AE (n=1). 
An overview of TEAEs reported is provided in Table 13.

Table 13 Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
Overall, all 28 subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. Serious TEAEs, Grade 3 and 4 
TEAEs, and TEAEs related to the IP were reported in 16 subjects (57.1%), 17 subjects (60.7%), and 
17 subjects (60.7%), respectively. Three subjects (10.7%) experienced a TEAE leading to drug 
discontinuation (pyrexia in MDS subject, and disease progression and abdominal pain in 1 JMML 
subject each with only the pyrexia was suspected to be related to study drug). No TEAEs leading to 
death, dose reduction, or drug interruption were reported. 
A summary of the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC and PT (in at least 10% of subjects in the 
Overall group) is provided in Table 14.

The highest proportion of subjects reporting TEAEs presented with Gastrointestinal Disorders (20 
subjects [71.4%]), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (18 subjects [63.4%]), Blood 
and Lymphatic System Disorders (17 subjects [60.7%]), Infections and Infestations (15 subjects 
[53.6%]), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (15 subjects [53.6%]), and Respiratory, Thoracic, 
and Mediastinal Disorders (11 subjects [39.3%]). The most frequently reported TEAEs (in ≥ 40% of 
subjects) were pyrexia (15 subjects [53.6%]) and anaemia (13 subjects [46.4%]). 
The majority of the Grade 3 and 4 TEAEs were reported in only 1 subject. Grade 3 and 4 TEAEs 
reported in > 1 subject were anaemia (11 subjects [39.3%]), thrombocytopenia (7 subjects [25.0%]), 
febrile neutropenia (4 subjects [14.3%]), neutropenia (3 subjects [10.7%]), and abdominal pain and 
pyrexia (2 subjects [7.1%] each). 
At least 1 treatment-related TEAE was reported in 17 (60.7%) subjects. Treatment-related TEAEs 
reported in > 1 subject were neutropenia and vomiting (3 subjects [10.7%] each) and anaemia, 
constipation, febrile neutropenia, nausea, pyrexia, and thrombocytopenia (2 subjects [7.1%] each). 
Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 9 subjects (32.1%) with the majority of the 
events reported in only 1 subject overall. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related TEAEs reported in > 1 
subject were neutropenia (3 subjects [10.7%]) and anaemia and febrile neutropenia (2 subjects 
[7.1%] each). 
Overall, 16 (57.1%) subjects experienced at least 1 serious TEAE. The majority of serious TEAEs were 
reported in 1 subject each. Serious TEAEs reported in > 1 subject were febrile neutropenia and pyrexia 
(4 subjects [14.3%] each), upper respiratory tract infection (3 subjects [10.7%]), and viral upper 
respiratory tract infection (2 subjects [7.1%]). 
No subject died during the treatment period. Three subjects died after 28 days following the end of 
treatment. Two subjects (1 MDS and 1 JMML) died due to “death from malignant disease under study, 
or complication due to malignant disease under study,” and 1 JMML subject died due to “death from 
other cause” (sepsis). 
The most common TEAEs of special interest reported were myelosuppression 16 subjects (57.1%) and 
infections 15 subjects (53.6%), which were expected based on the known pharmacology of azacitidine. 
The TEAEs of special interest of cardiac disorders were reported in 2 subjects, which were both 
considered not related by the investigator.  
Haematological TEAE of specific interest (neutropenia, 9 subjects (32.1%), thrombocytopenia 9 
subjects (32.1%), anemia, 13 subjects (46.4%)) and shifts in haematology laboratory parameters 
were observed consistent with known pharmacology of azacitidine. These generally worsened from 
baseline but did not lead to study discontinuation. 
 No second primary malignancies were reported in the study. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or performance status during the study. 
CHMP comments: 
The overall safety profile is consistent with what is already known from azacitidine. There were no 
new/unexpected observations. The sample size is too limited to determine whether the frequency of 
AEs is different from the known safety profile, but there does not seem to be major differences. 
All subjects experienced TEAE with gastrointestinal events (including constipation and vomiting), 
hematologic events (including anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia) and pyrexia 
occurring in the majority of subjects. These are also the events which were most commonly considered

related to treatment. Three subjects experienced a TEAE leading to drug discontinuation (pyrexia in 
MDS subject, and disease progression and abdominal pain in 1 JMML). No subject died due to AE. 
Overall, as in adults, treatment-related toxicity is substantial but manageable. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the results of a paediatric study (AZA-JMML-001) in which the effect of 
azacitidine was studied in paediatric patients newly diagnosed with advanced MDS or JMML. Patients 
were to receive 75 mg/m2 azacitidine (IV or SC) QD on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 
3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles before proceeding to HSCT. This is the same starting dose as 
recommended for the approved (adult) indication. 
All patients were expected to proceed to HSCT following azacitidine treatment, irrespective of the 
treatment effect of azacitidine. Which is supported as HSCT is the only curative treatment option for 
patients with AML and JMML. However, this significantly hampers the interpretability of the clinical 
relevance of a treatment effect. While an anti-tumour effect may be noted in terms of reduction in 
disease burden, the added value thereof on clinically relevant outcome measures such as OS or LFS 
cannot be estimated as this is confounded by HSCT, and while it is intuitively appealing to assume that 
a reduced tumour burden will increase the curative success of HSCT, this has currently not been shown 
for (paediatric) patients wilt AML or JMML. 
PK analyses indicate that azacitidine rapidly reached maximum plasma concentration within 5 minutes 
post IV administration in both the MDS and JMML population and that azacitidine plasma exposures are 
similar between the MDS and JMML populations, with only a trend for higher exposure in MDS patients. 
However due the high variation in azacitidine PK and the low number of subjects, conclusions on 
potential differences in exposure between MDS and JMML patients should be taken with caution. An 
assessment whether drug exposures from IV administration in JMML paediatrics are comparable with 
that from SC/IV administration in adults, supporting IV use in JMML, was lacking and should be 
provided. Further only PK data following IV administration were shown while S.C. was allowed under 
specific conditions. Information should be provided on the number of situations in Study AZA-JMML-
001 where azacitidine was administered via the SC route, and if available PK data from the S.C. 
administration should be provided as well. PK data in paediatric patients should be described in SmPC 
section 5.2.  
For the 10 MDS subjects, no confirmed responses were noted, but 1 subject achieved a (non-
confirmed) marrow CR. For the 18 treated JMML patients, there were 9 confirmed responses (3 
subjects with CR and 6 subjects with PR based on definition described by Niemeyer, 2015), and 2 
additional patients had non-confirmed responses (but were but were discontinued prior to response 
confirmation on Cycle 3 Day 28 for confirmation). 
It is noted that time to response is generally rapid and occurs within the first two cycles. Most of the 
other time dependent endpoints (DoR, OS, LFS) are difficult to interpret because all but 1 patient 
proceeded to HSCT and/or a control arm is lacking. Notably, while following azacitidine mostly partial 
responses were noted, the vast majority patients (both MDS and JMML) were leukaemia free following 
HSCT demonstrating the anti-leukemic effect of HSCT. 
While azacitidine was shown to slow disease progression in adults with MDS, this study indicates 
limited activity of azacitidine against MDS in paediatric patients. While in literature responses have 
been reported, this was generally at a low frequency, which seems particularly limited in relation to the 
effect of the subsequent HSCT on disease, where all subjects (initially) became disease free. Overall, 
the added value of treatment of azacitidine as a bridge to HSCT in children with MDS seems limited,

this is considered relevant information to the prescriber, therefore this information is provided in the 
SmPC. 
The current study shows that azacitidine is able to reduce disease burden in approximately 50% of 
newly diagnosed advanced JMML patients. However, the clinical relevance of such a response is difficult 
to estimate as the added value of a reduction in disease burden prior to HSCT for the outcome of HSCT 
in terms of OS and LFS, while intuitively appealing, is not known. Extrapolation from adults is not 
possible (JMML is a childhood disease), and an internal control was not included in the study. The 
matched pair analyses with a historical control group (matched for age and platelet count only) is 
accompanied by significant uncertainties which prohibit a conclusion on the effect of azacitidine prior to 
HSCT on survival outcome after HSCT. The observed activity of azacitidine in (paediatric) patients with 
JMML is of interest to the physicians, this information is provided in the SmPC.   
The observed safety profile is consistent with what is already known from azacitidine. There were no 
new/unexpected observations. The sample size is too limited to determine whether the frequency of 
AEs is different from the known safety profile, but there does not seem to be major differences. 
Overall, as in adults, treatment-related toxicity in the paediatric population is substantial but 
manageable. 
Finally, as the patient population in the current study with azacitidine differs from the approved patient 
population, the here reported efficacy results are not relevant for the approved indications. Moreover, 
as no new safety signals have been identified, also the safety profile is not changed. Therefore, it is 
considered that the results of this study do not impact the benefit-risk of azacitidine in the already 
approved (adult) indications. 
3.  Request for Supplementary Information requested  
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions: 
1.  Only PK data following IV administration were shown in the Study report. Information should 
be provided on the number of situations in Study AZA-JMML-001 where azacitidine was 
administered via the SC route. If possible, PK data should be reported separately following IV 
and SC administration in an updated CSR. 
2.  A discussion on the azacitidine PK in MDS and JMML patients was lacking in the Clinical 
Overview and should be provided. Furthermore PK data from the IV route from AZA-JMML-001 
in paediatrics should be pooled together with PK data (IV and SC) from adults for an analysis, 
assessing if the drug exposures from IV administration in JMML paediatrics are comparable 
with that from SC/IV administration in adults, supporting IV use in JMML. Such analysis may 
be conducted using popPK methodology. 
3.  The MAH is requested to provide a text proposal for the relevant sections of the SmPC 
describing the results of this study in a concise and informative manner. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  Only PK data following IV administration were shown in the Study report. Information should 
be provided on the number of situations in Study AZA-JMML-001 where azacitidine was 
administered via the SC route. If possible, PK data should be reported separately following IV 
and SC administration in an updated CSR. 
MAH Response to CHMP Question 1 
Celgene confirms that all subjects in Study AZA-JMML-001 received azacitidine via the intravenous (IV) 
administration route. No patient in the study received azacitidine via the subcutaneous (SC) 
administration route (see clinical study report [CSR] section 12.1). 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The Applicant confirmed that all patients received azacitidine via the IV route. 
Issue resolved 
2.  A discussion on the azacitidine PK in MDS and JMML patients was lacking in the Clinical 
Overview and should be provided. Furthermore PK data from the IV route from AZA-JMML-001 
in paediatrics should be pooled together with PK data (IV and SC) from adults for an analysis, 
assessing if the drug exposures from IV administration in JMML paediatrics are comparable 
with that from SC/IV administration in adults, supporting IV use in JMML. Such analysis may 
be conducted using popPK methodology. 
MAH Response to CHMP Question 2 
Celgene confirms that the Clinical Overview has been updated to include a discussion on azacitidine 
pharmacokinetics (PK) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia 
(JMML) (see Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.2.1). Minor editorial updates have also been included through the 
document, as well as some additional clarifications in Section 3.4.1 Efficacy, for accuracy. A version in 
track changes is included in this submission for ease of review. 
Study AZA-2002-BA-002 was a randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study to assess the 
bioavailability of SC and IV azacitidine administered at 75 mg/m2 in adult subjects with MDS. An 89% 
bioavailability of SC versus IV route was observed, therefore area under the plasma concentration time 
curve (AUC) is similar between IV and SC administration in adult subjects (refer to Table 1).

All subjects in Study AZA-JMML-001 have been treated via IV administration of azacytidine 75 mg/m2. 
Pharmacokinetic data from pediatric subjects included in Study AZA-JMML-001 (10 MDS and 18 JMML 
subjects) were pooled together and compared to PK data from the 6 adult subjects with MDS 
administered 75 mg/m2 azacitidine IV in Study AZA-2002-BA-002 to assess if azacitidine drug 
exposures from IV administration in pediatrics are comparable to IV administration in adults. Exposure 
of azacitidine (maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] and AUC from time zero to last time 
with detectable levels [AUC0-t]) was similar between adult and pediatric subjects after IV 
administration (refer to Table 2), supporting IV use of azacitidine in JMML subjects. 
CHMP comment: 
The Applicant compared exposure via IV administration of a 75 mg/m2 dose to paediatric MDS (n=10) 
and JMML patients (n=18) with that obtained upon IV administration of a 75 mg/ m2 dose to adult 
patients with MDS (n=6). Based on the mean exposure in all paediatric patients, exposure appears 
comparable with that in adult patients to a reasonable extent (i.e. AUC0-t 882.1 h.ng/ml in paediatric 
patients and 1025 h.ng/ml in adult patients, respectively). As expected, the Cmax in paediatric patients 
following IV administration was higher (2841 ng/ml) than that in adult patients after SC administration 
(i.e. 750 ng/ml, see Vidaza SmPC). 
Although exposure in the paediatric population was comparable for the whole (MDS and JMML) 
paediatric population, the geometric mean AUCinf in JMML patients appeared lower than in paediatric 
MDS patients (240.2 vs 606.9 h.ng/ml, respectively). The cause for this different exposure is unknown 
but may be partly due the high PK variability and also appears related to the younger age of the 
patients included for JMML than for MDS (median age 2.4 and 13.3 years, respectively). The causality 
of such relationship with age however is unclear. 
Overall, it can be concluded that exposure to azacitidine in paediatric patients 0-17 following IV 
administration of a 75 mg/ m2 dose appears in the same range as that in adults following IV 
administration of the same dose. Considering the high F of 89%, exposure is expected to be also 
comparable to that obtained in adults after SC administration of a 75 mg/ m2 dose.  
Issue resolved.

In Study AZA-JMML-001, 28 paediatric patients (1 month to less than 18 years of age) were treated 
with Vidaza for MDS (n = 10) or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) (n = 18) (see section 
5.1). 
All 28 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, of which and 17 (60.7%) experienced at least 
1 treatment-related event. The most commonly reported adverse events in the overall paediatric 
population were pyrexia, haematologic events including anaemia, thrombocytopenia and febrile 
neutropenia, and gastrointestinal events including constipation and vomiting. 
No events leading to death, dose reduction or drug interruption were reported Three (3) subjects 
experienced a treatment emergent event leading to drug discontinuation (pyrexia, disease

This section should list events that do occur and not those that do not. So instead of stating that there 
were no events leading to death, dose reduction or interruption, it should be stated that three (3) 
subjects experienced a treatment emergent event leading to drug discontinuation (pyrexia, disease 
progression and abdominal pain). Furthermore, a minor change to the second paragraph is proposed 
because of clarity.

Paediatric population 
Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established (see section 4.2). 
Study AZA-JMML-001 was a Phase 2, international, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and activity of Vidaza prior to HSCT in a total of 28 
paediatric patients (1 month to less than 18 years; 71% male) with newly diagnosed advanced MDS or 
JMML. The primary objective of the clinical study was to evaluate the effect of Vidaza on 
response rate at Cycle 3, Day 28. 
Patients (MDS, n = 10; JMML, n = 18; 3 month to 15 years; 71% male) were treated with 
intravenous Vidaza 75 mg/m²I.V., daily on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 3 cycles 
and a maximum of 6 cycles. The primary objective of the clinical study was to evaluate the effect of 
Vidaza on response rate at Cycle 3, Day 28. 
Enrolment in the MDS study arm was stopped after 10 MDS patients due to a lack of efficacy: no 
confirmed responses were recorded in these 10 patients.  
In JMML study arm, 18 patients (13 PTPN11, 3 NRAS, 1 KRAS somatic mutations and 1 clinical 
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF-1]) were enrolled. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles of 
therapy and 5 of them completed 6 cycles. A total of 11 JMML patients had a clinical response at Cycle 
3, Day 28, of these 11 subjects, 9 (50%) subjects had a confirmed clinical response (3 
subjects with cCR and 6 subjects with cPR). The efficacy of Vidaza in these JMML patients was 
compared to an external historical registry control (n = 44) using a matched analysis, matched for the 
two most important prognostic factors, age (less than 7 years) and platelet count (< 100 x 109/L). 
Among the cohort of JMML patients treated with Vidaza, there was a higher percentage of patients 7 
(43.8%) patients had a with sustained platelet response (counts ≥ 100 × 109/L), and a lower 
percentage of patients 7(43.8%) requireding transfusions at HSCT versus the historical cohort (9.1% 
and 63.6%, respectively). All patients proceeded to HSCT. 
Because of the study design (small patient numbers and various confounding factors), it cannot be 
concluded from this study whether Vidaza prior to HSCT improves survival outcome in JMML patients. 
See section 4.8 for safety information. 
CHMP comment: 
The first sentence can be removed as it contains superfluous information. It is proposed to first state 
the general design of the study and describe the enrolled patient population followed by the dosing. 
Information on the route of administration is relevant and thus added.

The comparison with historical controls should be removed, while it is relevant to know that all patients 
proceeded to transplant as intended.

Paediatric population 
In Study AZA-JMML-001, pharmacokinetic analysis was determined from 10 MDS and 18 JMML 
paediatric patients on Day 7 of Cycle 1 (see section 5.1). The median age (range) of the MDS 
patients was 13.3 (1.9-15) years and 2.1 (0.2-6.9) years for JMML patients. 
Following intravenous administration of a 75 mg/m2 dose, Vidaza rapidly reached Cmax within 0.083 
hours in both MDS and JMML populations. The geometric mean Cmax were 1797.5 and 1066.3 ng/mL, 
and the geometric mean AUC0-∞ were 606.9 and 240.2 ng∙h/mL, for MDS and JMML patients, 
respectively. The geometric mean volume of distribution in MDS and JMML subjects were 103.9 and 
61.1 L, respectively. It appeared that the total plasma exposure of Vidaza was higher in MDS subjects; 
however, moderate to high between-patient variability was noted for both AUC and Cmax. 
The geometric mean t½ were 0.4 and 0.3 hours, and the geometric mean clearances were 166.4 and 
148.3 L/h for MDS and JMML, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study AZA-JMML-001 was pooled together and compared to 
pharmacokinetic data from 6 adult subjects with MDS administered 75 mg/m2 Vidaza intravenously in 
Study AZA-2002-BA-002. Mean Cmax and AUC0-t of Vidaza were similar between adult patients and 
paediatric patients after intravenous administration (2750 ng/ml versus 2841 ng/ml and 1025 ng∙h/mL 
versus 882.1 ng∙h/mL, respectively).

4.  2nd Request for Supplementary Information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions: 
1.  The SmPC should be amended in line with the comments provided by the CHMP.   
MAH responses 
Question 1:  
The SmPC should be amended in line with the comments provided by the Rapporteur.   
MAH Response to CHMP Question 1 
The MAH has reviewed the SmPC changes proposed by the Rapporteur and would like to express 
agreement with all changes, with just one minor clarification under section 5.1.  
Section 5.1 
Rapporteur’s proposal: ‘All patients proceeded to HSCT’. 
MAH clarification: 17/18 patients proceeded to HSCT. The text could be updated to either state this, or 
be phrased as “all responding patients proceeded to HSCT”. 
Assessment of MAH response 
It is correct that one patient did not receive HSCT. We agree with the MAHsfirst proposal, to replace 
‘all patients proceeded to HSCT’ by ‘17/18 patients proceeded to HSCT’. 
5.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit-risk balance for the studied paediatric populations cannot be determined due to 
uncertainties on the clinical relevance of the observed effect which are caused by the study design. 
However, the data obtained in the current study are considered of interest to the physicians treating 
children with MDS and/or JMML. As this concerns a paediatric population, results were proposed to be 
included in the SmPC. Thus, text proposal for the relevant sections in the SmPC are generally 
acceptable provided that the suggested changes are implemented.  
The benefit-risk for the approved indications remains unchanged.

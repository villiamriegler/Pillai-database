Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vortioxetine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on dyspepsia from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including in several 
cases  a  close  temporal  relationship,  43  cases  reporting  a  positive  de-challenge  and  1  case  reporting  a 
positive re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and dyspepsia is at 
least a reasonable possibility.  
In  view  of  available  data  on  movement  disorders  (akathisia,  bruxism,  dystonia,  including  Meige 
syndrome, trismus, restless leg syndrome, tremor) from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous 
reports, including in several cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge (akathisia: n=18, 
bruxism: n=18, trismus: n=7, restless leg syndrome: n= 26, tremor: n=93) and re-challenge (1 case for 
bruxism,  trismus  and  tremor),  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  vortioxetine  and 
movement disorders is at least a reasonable possibility. 
In view of available data on sexual dysfunction from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports, 
including  in  several  cases  a  close  temporal  relationship,  79  cases  reporting  a  positive  de-challenge,  the 
PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and sexual dysfunction is at least a reasonable 
possibility. 
In view of available data on withdrawal reactions from the literature and spontaneous reports, including 
several  cases  reported  in  the  current  PSUR  period  with  a  plausible  time  to  onset,  some  cases  where 
symptoms resolved after resuming treatment with vortioxetine (positive “de-challenge”) and 2 cases where 
consecutive treatment interruptions caused withdrawal reactions (positive “re-challenge”), and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine 
and withdrawal reactions is at least a reasonable possibility. 
In view of available data on vision blurred from spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close 
temporal  relationship,  46  cases  reporting  a  positive  de-challenge  and  1  case  reporting  a  positive  re-
challenge,  and  in  view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur  considers  a  causal 
relationship between vortioxetine and vision blurred is at least a reasonable possibility.  
In view of available data on galactorrhoea from spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close 
temporal relationship, and 3 cases reporting a positive de-challenge from the current PSUR period, and in 
view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur  considers  a  causal  relationship  between 
vortioxetine and galactorrhoea is at least a reasonable possibility.  
The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be 
amended accordingly. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vortioxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vortioxetine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

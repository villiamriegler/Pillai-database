2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, affecting both  males and 
females, with  an estimated prevalence of 1:117,000  up to 1:40,000  (Desnick and Schindler, 2001; 
Meikle et al., 1999; Eurordis, 2005).  Mutations  in the GLA gene result in  a deficiency of the lysosomal 
enzyme, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which  is required for glycosphingolipid metabolism (Brady, 
1967).  Beginning early in life, the reduction in α-Gal A activity results in an accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-
Gb3). It leads to the symptoms and life-limiting  sequelae of Fabry disease, including  pain, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and early mortality

(Germain, 2010).  Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age at onset and can 
be divided into  two main phenotypes, “classic” and “late-onset” (Desnick et al., 2001).  Classical Fabry 
disease can affect all 3 major organs (heart, kidney, central nervous system) and in end-stage disease 
trigger life-threatening events. In contrast, variant α-Gal A mutations  may result in less aggressive 
clinical phenotypes, which  are, leading to single organ involvement and late-onset disease (Niemann  et 
al., 2014)  or so-called “atypical” Fabry patients.   
More than 1384  Fabry disease-causing GLA mutations have been identified based on data presented by 
the applicant. Approximately 60% are missense mutations, resulting in  single amino acid substitutions 
in α Gal A (Germain 2010;  Gal et al., 2006).  The majority of missense mutations  are associated with 
the classic phenotype (Filoni  et al., 2010;  Topaloglu et al., 1999;  Shabbeer et al., 2002; Shabbeer et 
al., 2006;  Ishii et al., 2007). This application considers paediatric patients with  amenable mutations, 
i.e. patients with  migalastat-responsive GLA mutations. Whether a patient is amenable to migalastat  is 
unrelated to the disease burden they might have/experience. Recent literature indicates that  the 
genotype cannot be translated to a phenotype. For example, mutation A143T causes Fabry Disease in 
only a limited  number of carriers. 
In addition to oral Galafold for the  treatment of Fabry disease, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), 
irrespective of the  severity of the disease is also available. These ERT products (Fabrazyme, Replagal) 
are intravenous (IV) infusion of manufactured enzyme to be administered every 14 days and are 
indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients  with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry 
disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency).  
The application is an extension of indication for Galafold (migalastat) to include long-term treatment of 
adolescents 12 to  < 16 years with  a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A 
deficiency) and who have an amenable mutation. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Migalastat,  a low molecular weight iminosugar, is an analogue of the terminal galactose of GL-3. Non-
clinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that migalastat  acts as a pharmacological 
chaperone, selectively and reversibly binding with  high affinity to  the active site of wild-type α-Gal A 
and specific mutant  forms of α Gal A (Ishii et al., 2007),  the genotypes of which  are referred to as 
amenable mutations.  Migalastat binding  stabilises these mutant  forms of α-Gal A in the  endoplasmic 
reticulum, facilitating  their proper trafficking to lysosomes where migalastat dissociation allows α-Gal A 
to reduce the  level of GL-3 and lyso-Gb3 (Yam et al., 2005, Yam et al., 2006;  Benjamin et al., 2009). 
Galafold (migalastat) is currently indicated for long-term treatment  of adults  and adolescents aged 16 
years and older with  a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who 
have an amenable mutation  (see the tables in section 5.1 of the SmPC).  
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The development programme is according to the paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The present application includes the results of Study AT1001-020 (stage 1),  which is a 2-stage, open-
label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the  safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), 
Pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of migalastat treatment  in paediatric subjects 12 to < 18  years 
of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg with  Fabry disease and with  amenable mutations to  the gene encoding α-

galactosidase A (GLA). Stage 2 will  collect efficacy data in these patients;  however, as this  pertains to 
an interim analysis, only the stage 1 data is submitted. 
Stage 1 of the  AT1001-020 study is a clinical measure (Study 3) defined in  the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) for migalastat (EMEA-001194-PIP01-11-M04),  to  support extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to  the adolescent population aged 12 to 15  years. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
Study AT1001-020  is being performed in compliance with  Good Clinical Practice as claimed by the 
applicant, including  archiving of essential documents. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this  application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
An updated environmental risk assessment has been submitted and is presented below. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The calculation of the  refined Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsurfacewater) of 
the Applicant is equal to that  of the initial marketing authorisation application (original submission). 
The extension of the indication for 12-16-year-old patients does not  affect the  PEC calculations; 
neither does it  affect the  persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) assessment. Therefore, the 
original conclusions that  Migalastat  is not subject to PBT, nor very persistent/very bioaccumulative 
(vPvB) and that  a phase II assessment is not necessary because the refined PECsw is 0.00077  µg/L, 
which is below the action limit  of 0.01 µg/L,  are still valid. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the  above data, migalastat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with  GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The development programme consisted of the following study: 
- A Phase 3b, 2-stage, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the  safety, PK, PD, and 
efficacy of migalastat treatment in paediatric subjects 12 to  < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45  kg 
(99 pounds) with  Fabry disease and with amenable GLA variants. Subjects were either naïve to 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)  or had stopped ERT at least 14 days at the time of screening. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/412211/2021  
Page 8/34 
 
 
 
 
Stage 1 consisted of a treatment period of approximately 1 month (4  weeks) during which time PK 
assessments were conducted (at baseline and between Days 15  and 30).   
To support this application, an interim clinical study report has been submitted,  presenting the  results 
of the stage 1 (1-month)  safety and PK data only for subjects with  Fabry disease in the 12 to < 16 
years old age group who had Stage 1 plasma concentration-time data available as of the cut-off date. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Special populations 
Sparse sampling for plasma migalastat concentrations to  estimate exposure was done at  baseline and 
for one 24-hour period between days 15 and 30. Patients with  1 plasma concentration-time data 
available as of the cut-off  date were included in the interim analysis. Subjects were randomly assigned 
to one of the 3 3 PK sampling groups. See Table 1. 
Table 1. Sparse sampling schedule in study AT1001-020. 
Plasma samples were analysed for migalastat using a validated LC-MS/MS method; this  method was 
also used in the  original MAA for the determination of migalastat. 
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
A population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model previously developed from healthy adult volunteers and 
adult patients  with  Fabry disease after oral migalastat administration.  After pooling plasma 
concentration-time data from Phase I, II, and III studies of AT1001 administered orally in adults using 
a range of doses from 25  mg to 675 mg and regimens under fasting conditions, the  following 
conclusions were made: 
• A two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with  linear time-dependent absorption 
sufficiently characterises the pharmacokinetics of migalastat in plasma after oral administration. 
• Renal function is the most important  determinant of variability in migalastat exposure, with an 
average 3-fold range occurring for eGFR values between 30  and 120  mL/min/1.73  m2. Subject 
weight  is the  second-largest determinant of variability in migalastat exposure, with  an average < 2-
fold difference for body weights between 50 and 170 kg. These average differences are not clinically 
relevant. 
• The predicted exposures in Fabry disease remain similar to those reported for healthy volunteers 
(although  a moderate decrease of 15%  - 31% in both  clearance and volume of distribution  was 
observed in healthy volunteers compared to Fabry patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/412211/2021  
Page 9/34 
 
 
 
The dose rationale for adults (123  mg every other day (QOD)) was supported by the evaluation of 
several dose levels and regimens in the 4 Phase II studies (50,  150, and 250 mg QOD; 50 mg once 
daily; 25, 100,  and 250  mg twice daily; and 250  and 500 mg x3 days and off 4 days). 
The present population  PK model was considered appropriate for adults; however, it  does not  have an 
allometric component with  standard exponents (e.g. 0.75  for CLT/F),  making paediatric predictions 
less feasible. Thus, the adult population  PK model requires some adjustments to allow extrapolation of 
migalastat PK to the paediatric age sub-groups of 2 to  <6, 6 to <12  and 12 to <18  years. 
The popPK model of migalastat showed that  subject weight (WT) and/or renal function  (estimated 
glomerular filtration  rate, eGFR) at baseline significantly impacted the  apparent oral plasma clearance 
(CLT/F)  and apparent oral volume of distribution of the central compartment (V2/F).  In contrast,  other 
covariates such as sex, age, drug formulation (solution or suspension vs 25 mg capsule vs 150 mg 
capsule) were not statistically/clinically significant.  Since renal function gradually increases from birth 
and reaches adult levels by the second year of life (Rubin 1949), there are no expected age-dependent 
changes in  eGFR in the  paediatric population 2 years and older than  adults. Additionally, paediatric 
patients with  Fabry disease usually have a normal renal function  or may experience renal 
hyperfiltration (Hopkin 2008);  therefore, weight-based dosing regimens, assuming that paediatrics 
have a normal renal function, were planned for the simulations in  paediatric Fabry patients. 
NONMEM  program was used to develop the  popPK model of migalastat in  adults using first-order 
conditional estimation with  interaction (FOCE-I).  Simulations were conducted using NONMEM  to obtain 
plasma concentration-time;  all graphical analyses were performed using R,; noncompartmental 
analysis and pharmacokinetic parameters summaries were conducted using Phoenix WinNonlin. 
Bootstrapping and visual predictive checks (VPC)s were conducted using Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN)  R 
packages of popED and mrgsolve were used in the optimal sampling strategy. 
The steps for population PK model optimisation  were: 
• Re-examine absorption models; 
• Add allometric scaling components to CLT/F and Q/F  with  an allometric exponent equal to 0.75 
and to V2/F and V3/F  with an allometric exponent equal to 1.0;  and 
• Evaluate whether the allometric exponent should be on total CLT/F or on the non-renal clearance 
only. 
The original linear time-dependent absorption model was chosen among the different absorption 
models because the  conditional weighted residual (CWRES) over time plots were substantially 
improved, with  much less bias and fluctuation  throughout the  profile. Because the time varying Ka 
model allows Ka to continuously increase, an upper limit  of time-dependent absorption coefficient Ka 
was set up at 24 hours post-dose to  provide reasonable Ka values in simulation/predictions; this  was 
considered to be a minimal change to the original model as the drug is considered to be fairly fully 
absorbed within  7-10 hours, regardless of the model chosen. 
The overall purpose of the model development was to come up with  a model for paediatric 
extrapolation. The theoretical power model indices of 0.75  (for CL and Q), and 1 (for V2 and V3) were 
applied and evaluated. The diagnostic plots  suggested that  allometric scaling was only appropriate for 
those < 70 kg. 
The final equations for CLT/F,  Q/F, V2/F  and V3/F  were presented as follows: 
•  WTCO = WT/70 when WT ≤ 70; WTCO = 1 when WT >  70, where WTCO was the allometric 
weight  coefficient with  allometric scaling for subjects with  weight  ≤ 70  kg.

Considering that  renal function is comparable between paediatric patients 2 years and up and adults, 
the model was modified to apply the allometric exponent to only the non-renal clearance component. 
The model that  successfully converged suggested only a very small portion of CLT/F was accounted for 
by non-renal clearance; therefore, the allometric scaling applied to this  very small non-renal clearance 
did not really impact the  overall CLT/F. The diagnostic plots also suggested that  applying the  allometric 
exponent to overall CLT/F for subjects < 70kg was better than applying it  to the non-renal clearance. 
Moreover, paediatric CLT/F  values extrapolated from the  non-renal model were higher than the overall 
CLT/F approach, resulting  in higher paediatric doses for achieving equivalent exposures with adults 
which was a less conservative approach. Therefore, the overall CLT/F scaling approach is more 
conservative and was chosen for the final model. 
The final model is shown in Table  2.

In addition, the estimated parameters from bootstrap (see Table 1) were nearly identical  to those 
estimated from the  original dataset. All parameters were estimated with  adequate precision. The 
NONMEM  estimates (which  assume each parameter has a normal distribution)  were nearly identical to 
the nonparametric bootstrap estimates (which do not  assume that  each parameter has a normal 
distribution). 
Model performance comparison was made for the adult  population. Simulations were performed using 
a simulated adult dataset following 150  mg QOD doses with  both model parameters and the steady-
state AUCtau and Cmax were compared. The results (see Table  3) showed comparable results 
between the original model and the optimised/updated model, indicating  a good model performance.

results for adults receiving 150 mg QOD  dose. 
Clinical trial simulations were then conducted to predict the exposure in paediatric patients  receiving 
the following initial  various weight-based dosing regimens (comparable to about a 3 mg/kg dose): 
• <15  kg receive 25 mg QOD 
• 15 to  <25 kg receive 50 mg QOD 
• 25 to  <35 kg receive 75 mg QOD 
• 35 to  <50 kg receive 100 mg QOD 
• ≥50 kg receive 150 mg QOD

The doses were targeted to achieve a similar AUCtau at  steady-state (and not  Cmax or Cmin) in 
paediatric sub-groups to that  in adults with  normal renal function  receiving migalastat 150 mg every 
other day (QOD). 
To be noted:  The paediatric simulations assumed the following: 
• 100  subjects per group for 4 groups including 3 paediatric groups with  Fabry disease (2 to 
<6, 6  to <12 and 12 to  <18 years) and 1 adult group (Fabry disease with normal renal 
function),  assuming 50%  males and 50% females in each group. 
• All children (and adults) had a normal renal function. 
• Age for paediatric subjects was sampled from a uniform distribution  within  the age limit of 
each group. 
• Weight  for paediatric subjects was sampled from the normal distribution  using the  World 
Health  Organization (WHO)  weight chart for age for those less than  5.08 yrs., and from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) weight  chart for those between 5.08 and 
17.99  year old. 
• The weight of the adult  group was sampled from a random normal distribution (mean=75, 
standard deviation (SD)=15). 
The results (see Table 4) showed that  the Cmax values were comparable among groups, whereas the 
AUCtau (0-48  hrs) was about 25%  lower in  age group 2 to <6 yr olds (5570  vs 7580 h*ng/ml),  and 
about 10% lower in age group 6 to  <12 yr olds (6850  vs 7580  h*ng/ml). 
Table 4. Paediatric  study design with empirical dose scheme PK parameters. 
A weight range analysis with a 5 kg increment on the simulated data was applied (see for results table 
PK 5). Using the AUCtau geometric mean value of adult group with  normal renal function receiving 150 
mg QOD dose as the target (7580  h*ng/ml),  dose adjustment was performed for subjects in each 
weight  group considering dose proportionality with  the equation: 
Doseadj,i = Doseorg,i* AUCtau,a /AUCtau,i , 
where Doseadj,i is the adjusted dose for each weight  group for achieving equivalent AUC exposure with 
adults, Doseorg,i is the  original dose used for each weight  group, AUCtau,a is the adult group geometric 
mean value of 7580  h*ng/ml,  and AUCtau,i is the geometric mean value for each weight  group.

Additionally, the adjusted doses were rounded to the nearest practical dose level to ensure simplicity in 
formulation preparation. 
Table 5. Paediatric  dose adjustment  per 5 kg weight range   
The resulted adjusted dosing scheme for paediatric groups was summarised as below: 
• <15  kg receive 40 mg QOD 
• 15 to  <25 kg receive 60 mg QOD 
• 25 to  <35 kg receive 80 mg QOD 
• 35 to  <45 kg receive 100 mg QOD 
• ≥45 kg receive 150 mg QOD 
Based on the dose adjustment  analysis and the new revised dosing scheme, simulations were re-run 
for the 3 paediatric groups (paediatric group age 2 to <6, 6 to  <12 and 12 to <18  yrs), with  all other 
assumptions and settings unchanged. The results are shown in Table 6 and Figure 4.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
All 9 subjects aged 12 to  < 16 years and weighing ≥ 45 kg enrolled and dosed complied with  study 
eligible criteria and completed stage 1 of the study AT1001-020.  Protocol deviations were clearly 
described in the dossier.  
The CHMP noted that  there were two deviations related to  the collection of the  PK samples. 
Nonetheless, from data listing  16.2.6.2.1  for one subject, only collection of the  2 PK samples was 
recorded. This was contrary to the information given in the protocol deviation form. In addition, there 
were missing records of the 4th PK sample collection from two subjects. The deviations, however, were 
not found in the  list of the protocol deviations. During the procedure, the MAH  adequately clarified 
these differences, in particular the  fact that some of the  missing PK data were due to amount of the 
samples for analysis as determined by the laboratory. This insufficient amount of the sample was not 
specified as protocol deviation and therefore was not included in the deviation list. The CHMP 
concluded that these deviations of the PK collection and analyses had only minor impact on PK 
assessment and Population PK modelling and simulation. 
The dose administered was 123  mg every other day for subjects aged 12 to <  18 years and weighing 
≥ 45 kg. The dose regimen was the  same as the  adult dose and was supported by simulation  results 
from a population pharmacokinetic model. The PopPK model in  paediatric patients with  Fabry disease 
was developed based upon PK, PD and safety data from adults  with Fabry disease and normal renal 
function.   
The population pharmacokinetics model previously developed from healthy adult volunteers, and adult 
patients with  Fabry disease after oral administration of migalastat was adjusted to  be applied in the 
paediatric population.  Allometric scaling components to CLT/F and Q/F  with an allometric exponent 
equal to 0.75 and to V2/F  and V3/F with  an allometric exponent equal to  1.0 were added to optimise 
the model. The updated model showed acceptable performance based upon Goodness of fit  plots, 
Visual Predictive Check, and the estimated parameters from bootstrap. 
Based upon limited data obtained from adolescent patients aged 12 – 18 years (n=9),  popPK data 
showed that exposure in adults and adolescents weighing ≥ 45 kg receiving the 123 mg migalastat 
capsule Q.O.D. were comparable. See Table 7. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/412211/2021  
Page 17/34 
 
 
 
 
Simulations of PK parameters were conducted using the  modified popPK model of migalastat to  predict 
migalastat  exposure in  paediatric  patients  with  Fabry  disease. The  simulated  parameter  of  AUC0-τ  in 
adolescents who are 12 to < 16 years old and who weigh ≥ 45 kg lies within the 80-125% bioequivalence 
limits  (compared to adults).  See Table 8. For  Cmax, only in the  age group of 12  – 16  years, Cmax was 
slightly  outside  the  80  –  125%  (90%)  confidence interval (see Table  8).However, the  observed Cmax 
levels in children (aged 6 to 12 years and ≥45 kg BW) were in line with the Cmax levels (min, max: 503, 
2513  ng/ml;  as  observed in  the  pivotal  study  AT1001-011  in  adults.  AEs  were  mild  in  intensity  and 
unrelated to  treatment,  except for drug  interruption  which could  be treatment related according to  the 
investigator. Based on these data, this  finding was not  considered to significantly impact on  the benefit 
risk of  the  product  tin  this  population,  however the  CHMP  recommended to  reflect this  information  in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The limited pharmacokinetic data support the proposed 123  mg migalastat  capsule Q.O.D. dose in 
adolescents weighing ≥45  kg and the  results of the simulations  are considered sufficiently worded in 
the SmPC section 5.2.  Due to the  capsule size and inclusion criteria of study AT1001-020,  the 123 mg 
migalastat capsules are not suitable for patients  less than  45 kg body weight and for the lower weight 
and age groups. The MAH intends  to design and evaluate a new formulation, migalastat HCl  oral 
formulation (sachet and/or capsules) for treatment of Fabry disease in paediatric and adolescent 
patients aged 2 to <18  years and with  amenable GLA mutations. Thus, the  CHMP recommended to 
include a warning for the lower weight  group within  the proposed age group (12 to below 16 years) in 
this application. 
Plasma samples were analysed using the previously validated LC-MS/MS  method. The final 
bioanalytical report will be expected later together with  the clinical study report. This is acceptable 
since the method validation has been already assessed during original MAA and reliable method 
performance was demonstrated several times in previous clinical studies. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology has been adequately documented for the  new paediatric age group 
(12 to  below 16  years) and meet the requirements to  support this application.

, The safety population included all subjects aged 12  to < 16 years who received at least 1  dose or a 
partial dose of study drug and had Stage 1 plasma concentration-time data available as of the cut-off 
date. All safety analyses were performed using the safety population. 
Pharmacokinetic Population 
The PK population included data from subjects aged 12 to <  16 years who have completed Stage 1 
and who received at least 1 dose of migalastat with at  least 1 quantifiable  concentration. All subjects 
included in the Interim Analysis PK population must also have a known weight and an eGFR. 
General  Statistical Methods 
Safety data was summarised using descriptive statistics  and/or response frequencies. For numerical 
data, descriptive statistics  included the number of subjects with  non-missing data (n), mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum,  and maximum. For categorical data, descriptive statistics  were 
categorised by frequency counts and proportions (or percentages) of the number of subjects used in 
the analysis. The counts for the categories for ‘Missing,’ ‘Unknown,’  or ‘Not  applicable’ were provided 
as appropriate, but the  percentages were not provided. 
For AEs, partially missing start  dates were imputed to determine treatment-emergence only. No other 
missing data imputation  was performed.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol of study AT1001-020  was dated 20 February 2018 and was amended four times. 
The most important changes were made by means of amendment 1 and 2, namely design of the  study 
which was separated into  2 stages, changes performed in collection of PK samples as well as increase 
in total  number of subjects enrolled into the  study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were also revised. 
The inclusion requirement for subjects to  be off ERT treatment for 6 months was reduced to 14 days 
since investigator does not perceived impact on bridging  of PK assessment as was seen in adult 
studies. An exclusion criterion of any prior or anticipated use of gene therapy was added. Two subjects 
were enrolled under Amendment 1; the rest of the subjects were enrolled under Amendment 3 and 4. 
Amendment 4 of the  protocol and the final PK analyses plan dated 6 February2019 refer to  multiple 
interim analyses. Nonetheless, a decision was made to conduct  only 1 formal interim analysis. A 
preliminary, unpublished PK interim analysis was conducted by the  vendor in order to assess model 
performance. Therefore, this interim analysis is referred to as Interim Report #2.  PK samples were 
collected in all subject between Days 15 to  30 in order to capture steady-state data. All subjects 
comply with  eligibility criteria settled in protocol amendment 4. Any impact of the changes performed 
in study protocol on study results is not  expected.  
A total of 21 protocol deviations were reported during the first month  of study for the 9 subjects in the 
safety population.  All but  1 deviation was minor, with  the majority (14) related to study procedures 
(i.e. procedures completed when not  required, vital signs measured inconsistently) and subject 
compliance (i.e. electronic diary completion). There were no deviations related to  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. 
The major deviation was due to a missed procedure (i.e. Tanner staging), which was refused by the 
subject. 
Baseline data 
A total of 9 subjects, 4 females and 5 males, aged 12 to < 16 years were enrolled in Study AT1001-
020,  received study drug, and completed Stage 1 of the study with  PK concentration data. They 
comprised the safety and PK populations for this interim analysis. The mean number of years since 
diagnosis of Fabry disease was 10.2 (± 4.12)  years. Four subjects reported prior use of enzyme 
replacement therapy. 
The median duration of migalastat exposure for the  9 subjects enrolled in Study AT1001-020 was 30 
days; maximum exposure was 49 days.

Summary of main study 
Not  applicable. There is no efficacy data collected in part 1  of this  Phase 1/2 study. Hence, the 
extension of the indication  from patient  over 16 years of age to patients aged 12 years of age and over 
is solely based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics modelling. Refer to the sections 2.3.2 and 
2.3.3. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
To support the present application to extend the  existing indication  to the paediatric age range of 12-
below 16 years, the safety data from the interim analysis of the ongoing study AT1001-020  are 
presented below.  
Patient exposure 
Study AT1001-020 
A total of 22 subjects were enrolled.  
The safety population was defined as all subjects aged 12 to  < 16 years and weighing ≥ 45 kg who 
received at least 1  dose or partial dose of study drug, had Stage 1 plasma concentration-time  data 
available, and completed 1 month  of migalastat treatment as of the data cut-off  date of 31 January 
2020.  As of the data cut-off, 9 subjects were enrolled in the study and completed Stage 1. Total

exposure mean (SD) was 33.0  days (± 7.55)  and maximum exposure was 49 days.  
From that,  2 subjects (22.2%) already completed Stage 1 and 2. The remaining 7 subjects are ongoing 
in the study. 
Adverse events

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug 
One event was considered possibly related to migalastat treatment by the principal investigator. Drug 
eruption occurred 2 days following  the start of treatment with  migalastat. It was treated with a topical 
corticosteroid and subsequently resolved after 45 days, with no change to migalastat treatment. 
Subject 2308-5148,  completed the study and is currently enrolled in a long-term extension study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During Stage 1,  no treatment-emergent serious adverse events or deaths were reported in the  safety 
Population.

Laboratory findings 
During Stage 1,  urinalysis (albumin, protein, specific gravity, pH,  and microscopy) was the only 
laboratory parameter collected at Month  1 and therefore, the  only laboratory parameter assessed for 
the Interim Analysis. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in  mean values from baseline for urinalysis parameters at 
Month  1. 
There were a few shifts from baseline to Month  1. Three subjects had pH  values that went  from normal 
at baseline to  high at Month  1. 
There were no potentially  clinically significant  abnormalities in urinalysis parameters.  
Urine pregnancy tests were performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at every visit. 
No female subject in the safety population had a positive pregnancy test  result during Stage 1. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During Stage 1,  there were no patients  in the safety population who discontinued due to an adverse 
event. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
During Stage 1,  there were no deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations  due to an AE in the safety population. 
The investigators determined all TEAEs to  be mild in severity. One event (drug eruption) was 
considered possibly related to migalastat treatment by the principal investigator. Urinalysis, vital signs, 
and physical findings were all non-remarkable. Overall, results indicated that  1 month of treatment 
with  migalastat HCl 150  mg QOD was generally safe and well-tolerated in subjects aged 12 to < 16 
years with  Fabry disease. As it is expected, migalastat will  be used for long-term treatment; long term 
safety data (>  1 year) in adolescents aged 12  to < 16 years are missing. Following  CHMP 
recommendation, this  information was reflected in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  Study AT1001-036 
enrolls subjects who completed 12 months of migalastat treatment in  Study AT1001-020,  which 
concluded in February 2021.  As of 23 September 2020,  in Study AT1001-036,  7 subjects are enrolled 
in the phase 3b safety open-label paediatric extension of Study AT1001-020  for adolescents (as of). 
Duration of treatment period for this study is to be determined. 
Therefore, all subjects who continue in  Study AT1001-036 have long-term (i.e. >  1 year) exposure to 
migalastat. The MAH informed the CHMP  that the  study will continue at least 2 years and potentially 
longer unless migalastat is reimbursed for commercial use in this  age group. 
Following  CHMP recommendation, the  existing prospective, observational registry of patients  with 
Fabry disease (Study AT1001-030) is planned to be amended to collect long-term safety data in  this 
paediatric population  (12 to below 16 years). A revised protocol is to be submitted  within  defined 
timelines in the RMP (see section 2.6). 
Results were consistent with  the safety profile of migalastat, with  no new or unexpected safety findings 
observed in this population during Stage 1. 
A total of 6 mild TEAEs in 5 patients, mainly consistent with  the most common medical history of 
subjects, were reported. One AE related to  migalastat (drug eruption) was recorded. However, it

didn´t  require discontinuation  of the  study drug and resolved within  the study. Of note, rash is a 
common ADR presented in the SmPC. No SAE or discontinuation  due to  adverse event was reported. 
Urinalysis, vital signs, and physical findings were all non-remarkable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety findings have been observed during stage 1 of the study. Hence treatment with 
migalastat 123 mg in  paediatric patients aged ≥12 to 16  years of age does not lead to a different 
safety profile than already known. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, affecting both  males and 
females, with  an estimated prevalence of 1:117,000  up to 1:40,000  (Desnick and Schindler, 2001; 
Meikle et al., 1999; Eurordis, 2005).  Mutations  in the GLA gene result in  a deficiency of the lysosomal 
enzyme, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which  is required for glycosphingolipid metabolism (Brady, 
1967).  Beginning early in life, the reduction in α-Gal A activity results in an accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-
Gb3). It leads to the symptoms and life-limiting  sequelae of Fabry disease, including  pain, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and early mortality 
(Germain, 2010).  Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age at onset and can 
be divided into  two main phenotypes, “classic” and “late-onset” (Desnick et al., 2001). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In addition to oral Galafold for the  treatment of Fabry disease, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), 
irrespective of the  disease's severity, is also available. It consists of an intravenous (IV) infusion of 
manufactured enzyme every 14 days. These ERTs are approved for use in patients aged 7 years and 
older. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The proposed extension to the  indication is supported by data from Study AT1001-020,  which  is a 2-
stage, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter  study to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of 
migalastat treatment in  paediatric subjects 12 to <18  years of age and weighing  ≥ 45 kg with  Fabry 
disease and with  amenable mutations to the  gene encoding α-galactosidase A (GLA). Stage 2 will 
collect efficacy data in these patients;  however, as this pertains to an interim analysis, only the stage 1 
data is submitted. 
Stage 1 of the  AT1001-020 study is a clinical measure (Study 3) defined in  the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) for migalastat (EMEA-001194-PIP01-11-M04),  to  support extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to  the adolescent population aged 12 to 15  years. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based upon limited data obtained from adolescent patients aged 12 – 18 years (n=9),  popPK data 
showed that exposure in adults and adolescents weighing ≥45 kg receiving the 123  mg migalastat 
capsule q.o.d. was comparable. 
ANOVA analysis showed predicted bioequivalence values within  the 80 – 125%  criteria for AUC. For 
Cmax only in the aged group of 12 – 16  years, Cmax was slight outside the 80 – 125%  (90%) confidence 
interval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/412211/2021  
Page 31/34 
 
 
 
 
The simulated parameter of AUC0-τ  in adolescents 12 to  < 16 years old and who weigh ≥ 45 kg lies 
within  the 80-125%  bioequivalence limits (compared to adults).   
Cmax levels observed in the paediatric patients were in line with  the Cmax levels observed in adults 
patients in  the pivotal study AT1001-011. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No efficacy data from stage 2 of the study has been presented. Study AT1001-020 is ongoing. 
The 123 mg migalastat capsule are unsuitable for patients  <45 kg body weight.  For this reason, a 
different formulation is under development. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No unexpected safety issues were noted. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is based on limited number of patients  (n= 9) aged 12 – 18 years. 
As it is expected, migalastat will  be used for long-term treatment,  long term safety data (>1 year) in 
adolescents aged 12 to <16  years are currently missing and will be collected in  the post-marketing 
setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Only 9 paediatric patients  aged 12 to  16 years were included in this interim  analysis. This is rather 
limited; however, given the rarity of the  disease, this is considered acceptable. Additional efficacy and 
safety data are expected as part of the final results of the  study AT1001-020 and study AT1001-036 
which enrolls subjects who  completed 12 months  of migalastat treatment  in Study AT1001-020,  for at 
least 2 years and potentially  longer unless migalastat is reimbursed for commercial use in this age 
group. 
No unexpected safety issues were noted. However, given the lack of long term data, the existing 
prospective, observational registry of patients with  Fabry disease (Study AT1001-030),  part of the 
existing risk management plan, is intended to be extended to this  new paediatric population (12  to 
below 16 years). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although at  this moment, no efficacy data is submitted, it  is not expected that  there is a difference in 
the mode of action of migalastat in the  patients 12 to <16  years of age. The efficacy results in patients 
≥16 of age and older can be extrapolated to  the younger patients (12  to <16 years) based on the on 
the population pharmacokinetic model showed that exposure in adults and adolescents weighing  ≥45 
kg receiving the 123 mg migalastat capsule q.o.d. were comparable. Therefore, the extension of the 
indication in  paediatric population aged 12 to below 16 years is acceptable.  
The safety results indicated that  1 month of treatment with  migalastat 123 mg QOD was generally safe 
and well-tolerated in patients aged 12 to <16  years with Fabry disease. Results were consistent with 
the known safety profile of migalastat. No new or unexpected safety findings observed in this 
population during Stage 1. Further long-term data will  be collected through the  final results of the 
ongoing studies AT1001-020,  AT1001-036  and AT1001-030  (existing observational registry) and thus 
the limitation  of the safety data in this  new paediatric population is considered adequately addressed. 
The B/R of Galafold is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Galafold is positive.

Extension of indication for Galafold (migalastat) to include long-term treatment of adolescents 12  to < 
16 years with  a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who  have an 
amenable mutation.  As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2,  4.4, 4.8 and 5.2  of the SmPC and Section 1 
and 2 of the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. A revised RMP version 6 has also been 
submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to  the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted  with  the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to  the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0137/2019  and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

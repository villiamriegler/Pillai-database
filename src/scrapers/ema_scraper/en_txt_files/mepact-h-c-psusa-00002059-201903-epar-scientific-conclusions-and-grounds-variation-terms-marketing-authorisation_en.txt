  Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for mifamurtide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based upon the review of the cases, a causal association between mifamurtide and the occurrence of 
pericardial effusion is considered likely in view of cases with a plausible time-to-occurrence (TTO), 
absence of other causative factors, and positive dechallenge. In the SmPC of mifamurtide, pericarditis is 
mentioned in section 4.4. In addition, pericardial effusion is a listed adverse drug reaction (ADR) for 
another immunostimulant, i.e. aldesleukin. Therefore, the SmPC of mifamurtide should be updated with 
the inclusion of pericardial effusion as an ADR in section 4.8 under SOC Cardiac disorders. A frequency 
of ‘not known (cannot be estimated from available data)’ is considered appropriate. The PL should be 
updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mifamurtide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing mifamurtide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for imatinib, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on panniculitis and based on a possible class effect, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between imatinib and panniculitis (including erythema nodosum) is established. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing imatinib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for imatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing imatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

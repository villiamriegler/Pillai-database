2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease  
In most cases stomach (gastric) cancer (GC) starts in the lining of the stomach, growing slowly over the 
course  of  several  years  and  causing  few  if  any  symptoms.  Most  patients  (up  to  95  percent)  develop 
adenocarcinoma and are typically classified based on anatomic location (cardia/proximal, arising in the 
region adjoining the GEJ, or non-cardia/distal, arising in the lower portion of the stomach) and histologic 
type  (diffuse,  with  undifferentiated  tumour  cells,  or  intestinal,  with  well-differentiated  tumour  cells). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 8/188 
 
 
 
1Overexpression  or  amplification  of  the  HER2  gene  or  protein  is  reported  in  approximately  20%  of 
patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, with higher rates of HER2 positivity seen in patients with intestinal 
histology than those with diffuse histology. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The wording of the proposed indication is:  
ENHERTU as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2-positive 
gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction  (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma  who  have  received  a  prior  trastuzumab-
based regimen. 
The proposed dose of ENHERTU is 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion over 90 minutes.  2,3 Patients who tolerate the first 90
minute infusion can receive subsequent 
infusions  over  30  minutes.  Treatment  may  be  continued  until  symptomatic  disease  progression  or 
‑
unacceptable toxicity. 
Epidemiology, risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
GC  is  the  fourth  most  commonly  diagnosed  cancer  4,5(5.6%  of  all  newly  diagnosed  cancers)  and  the 
third  most  common  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths  worldwide.  In  Western,  Southern  and  Northern 
Europe in 2020, there were an estimated 70,522 new cases of GC and 46,979 patients died of GC. The 
rates  of  GC  are  2-fold  higher  in  men  than  in  women.  The  incidence  of  GC  varies  significantly  among 
geographic regions, with the highest rates reported in Eastern Asia (including Japan and South Korea 
where it is amongst the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men), Central and Eastern Europe, and 
South  America,  while  rates  in  Western  Europe,  Northern  Europe,  and  North  America  are  lower.  Most 
patients present with inoperable advanced or metastatic disease requiring palliative treatment, although 
early detection is more common in Asia than in other regions. 5-year survival for advanced or metastatic 
gastric cancer is around 5–20%, with median overall survival being less than 1 year. 
The major risk factors for developing gastric cancer include male gender, H. pylori infection, increasing 
age, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Other risk factors include salt in diet, positive family history, 
and pernicious anaemia. The risk of gastric cancer is nearly six times higher for H. Pylori-infected than 
for uninfected individuals; however, whilst around 60% of the world’s population are infected with H. 
Pylori, less than 0.5% will develop gastric adenocarcinoma.6 
It is recognized that GC is difficult to treat at an advanced stage when it is no longer curable and survival 
outcomes  are  poor.  Compared  with  the  Asian  countries  that have  national  screening  programs  which 
starts  at  approximately  40  years  of  age  allowing  early  detection  of  the  disease,  patients  in  Western 
countries  with  a  low  incidence  are  more  often  diagnosed  at  the  advanced  stage  and  have  a  worse 
prognosis.

Aetiology and pathogenesis 
There are three types of adenocarcinoma7: 
Non-cardia  (Distal)  Stomach  Cancer:  This  type  of  stomach  cancer  may  be  related  to  long  periods  of 
inflammation and irritation in the lower part of the stomach. It is often associated with chronic infection 
of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori and is more common in developing countries than in other parts of 
the world. 
Proximal Stomach Cancer: This type of stomach cancer starts in the first (proximal) part of the stomach 
and  may  extend  into  the  gastroesophageal  junction  (where  the  oesophagus  joins  the  stomach).  This 
cancer is more common in the western part than in other parts of the world, and tends to start in people 
who are obese or have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. 
Diffuse Stomach Cancer: This aggressive cancer grows rapidly in the cells of the stomach wall. It does 
not form a mass or a tumour, so it can be challenging to diagnose. It tends to start in younger people 
with a family history of the disease where a mutation in the adhesion molecule E Cadherin can be the 
cause (also associated with breast cancer) or a related genetic syndrome. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The symptoms of gastric cancer are frequently vague and non-specific, with patients often unfortunately 
presenting at an advanced stage. The common presenting symptoms include dyspepsia (particularly if 
new onset or not responsive to simple PPI treatment), dysphagia, early satiety, vomiting, or melena. 
Non-specific cancer symptoms (anorexia, weight loss, or anaemia) are markers of late stage disease. 
On examination, clinical signs are usually absent, especially in the early stages, however an epigastric 
mass may be felt in late stage disease. Troisier sign is the presence of a palpable left supraclavicular 
node (Virchow node) and is considered a sign of metastatic abdominal malignancy (typically gastric). 
Other signs of metastatic disease include hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, or acanthosis nigricans. 
The  primary  investigation  of  any  suspected  gastric  cancer  is  an  urgent  upper  GI  endoscopy  (OGD), 
allowing for the direct visualisation of any malignancy present and subsequent biopsies taken as needed. 
Biopsies 8from suspected gastric malignancies should be sent for: 
• 
• 
• 
Histology – for classification and grading of any neoplasia present. 
CLO test – for the presence of H. Pylori. 
HER2/neu protein expression – this will allow for targeted therapies if present. 
For staging and in order to plan treatment, all patients need a CT Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis and a staging 
laparoscopy  (to  look  for  peritoneal  metastases),  the  most  commonly  used  staging  system  for  gastric 
cancers is TNM staging.

5-year relative survival rates for GC 
These numbers are based on people diagnosed with cancers of the stomach between 2010 and 2016.9 
Management 
The current standard of care (SoC) for metastatic GC in the first-line setting based on guidelines in the 
EU,  US,  and  Japan  is  a  combination  of  chemotherapy  with  a  fluoropyrimidine  agent  (fluorouracil, 
capecitabine,  or  S-1  [EU  and  Japan])  and  a  platinum  agent  (oxaliplatin  or  cisplatin).  The  oral 
fluoropyrimidine regimen S-1 (tegafur [a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil]/gimeracil/oteracil) is approved in the 
EU and Japan in this indication, but not in the US. 
Based on the ToGA study10, for patients with HER2-positive disease, the SoC in the EU, US and Japan is 
the  fluoropyrimidine  +  platinum  combination  with  the  addition  of  the  anti-HER2  monoclonal  antibody 
(mAb) trastuzumab.  
Second line treatment: Based on the REGARD and RAINBOW trials, the SoC in the EU is ramucirumab 
(a mAb targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) in combination with paclitaxel. These 
trials  included  patients  regardless  of  HER2  expression.  Other  treatment  options  in  the  second-line  or 
subsequent therapy setting include single-agents docetaxel, paclitaxel, irinotecan and FOLFIRI (folinic 
acid,  fluorouracil,  and  irinotecan).  Regimens  recommended  in  third-line  or  beyond  are  irinotecan, 
taxanes, pembrolizumab if PD-L1 expression by CPS ≥1, and the trifluridine/tipiracil regimen.  
Locally  advanced  or  metastatic  HER2-positive  gastric  adenocarcinoma  remains  an  incurable  disease. 
Once patients have progressed after a first-line regimen that includes an anti-HER2 therapy, the disease 
outcomes  are  poor.  Currently,  there  is  no  approved  targeted  anti-HER2  therapy  in  the  EU  for  the 
treatment of metastatic HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma in the second-line setting and beyond, 
which constitutes an unmet medical need.

2.1.2.  About the product 
The active substance in ENHERTU, trastuzumab deruxtecan, is made up of two active components which 
are linked together: 
• 
Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that has been designed to attach to HER2, which is found 
in large quantities on some cancer cells. By attaching to HER2, trastuzumab activates cells of the immune 
system, which then kill the cancer cells. Trastuzumab also stops HER2 from stimulating the growth of 
cancer cells.  
• 
Deruxtecan, a toxic substance that kills cells when they attempt to divide and grow. It becomes 
active once the trastuzumab component has attached to HER2 and enters the cancer cell. Deruxtecan 
blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I, which is involved in copying cell DNA and is needed to make 
new cells. By blocking the enzyme, cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and they eventually die. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is currently approved as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2 
based regimens.  The recommended dose for HER2-positive BC is 5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (Q3W).

with 
CHMP 
Scientific advice from the CHMP was not sought concerning the clinical development of Enhertu in the 
GC/GEJC setting. 
A pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteurs was held on 30 August 2021. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH claims that the studies are conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin  in  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  that  are  consistent  with  the  International  Council  for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
New non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.  
Results  from  11  nonclinical  studies  with  human  biomaterials  were  previously  submitted  and  are  not 
described further. An additional nonclinical study (Study TCRM-DMPK-2020-19) was conducted after the 
initial BC application. This additional study using cryopreserved hepatocytes supported that the released 
drug (DXd), at concentrations of up to 30 nmol/L, did not show any induction potential or effect on the 
metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2B6. 
However,  a  new  environmental  risk  assessment  report  was  submitted  to  reflect  the  new  intended 
indication. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (herein  referred  to  as  T-DXd)  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  as  a 
monotherapy  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer who have received 2- or more prior 
anti-HER2-based  regimens  (EMEA/H/C/005124).  Daiichi  Sankyo  Europe  is  submitting  this  type  II 
Assessment report

variation to register T-DXd, as a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who 
have  received  a  prior  anti-HER2-based  regimen.  An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  has  been 
undertaken  for  T-DXd  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guidance  (CHMP  2006:  EMEA/CPMP/SWP/4447/00 
and CHMP 2016: EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tabulated summary: 
Summary 
T-DXd is an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti-HER2 mAb covalently conjugated to a 
drug-linker,  deruxtecan.  The  drug-linker  is  composed  of  a  cleavable  maleimide  tetrapeptide  and  the 
released drug, DXd. DXd is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. The three components of T-DXd, mAb, 
tetrapeptide  linker,  and  drug  (DXd),  will  be  examined  individually  within  this  assessment.  The  three 
components are designed to dissociate from one another once bound to the HER2 positive target cell in 
patients and therefore they will be excreted separately and can be treated as separate molecules within 
the environmental risk assessment. 
Both the mAb and the tetrapeptide linker are considered to be naturally occurring molecules (i.e., they 
are polypeptides or proteins), which are not expected to remain either stable or biologically active in the 
environment for any significant period of time because of their high susceptibility to rapid chemical (e.g., 
oxidation,  deamidation,  proteolysis,  beta  elimination  and  disulfide  scrambling)  and  physical  (e.g., 
denaturation  (protein  unfolding),  aggregation,  precipitation,  and  surface  adsorption)  degradation,  as 
well  as  biodegradation  by  a  wide  range  of  microflora,  and  various  physical  removal  mechanisms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 13/188 
 
 
 
 
Degradation may be easily triggered from exposure to uncontrolled ambient environmental conditions 
(e.g., due to desiccation, suboptimal pH or temperature, and light exposure). 
The  mAb  and  the  tetrapeptide  linker  molecules  are  considered  to  be  non-hazardous,  biodegradable 
products. As such, the environmental risk in terms of use and disposal is considered to be negligible and 
in accordance with the guideline (CHMP 2006: EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), ERA studies are not required. 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient DXd is a topoisomerase I inhibitor and is released from the mAb 
and linker portion of T-DXd upon binding to the target cell. Therefore, the environmental risk assessment 
considers this molecule in isolation. 
The  calculated  refined  PECsurfacewater  is  below  the  Phase  I  action  limit  (0.01  μg/L);  therefore,  the  risk 
assessment for T-DXd ceases at Phase I. No Phase II environmental risk assessment is required, see 
below for details. 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity 
The monohydrate form of DXd (named MAAA-1181d) was used for all experimental testing but is referred 
to  as  DXd  throughout  this  assessment.  This  is  not  considered  to  impact  the  risk  assessment  to  any 
significant extent. No molar conversion of the monohydrate form is considered necessary within this risk 
assessment. 
The octanol-water distribution coefficient, Log Dow, of DXd was determined across an environmentally 
relevant  pH-range.  The  log  Dow  values  were  in  the  range  1.28  to  1.92,  and  since  they  are  <4.5,  no 
further screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is necessary. 
Calculation of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
Approved indications 
T-DXd is approved as a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer who have received 
2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. 
Extensions and New indications 
Daiichi Sankyo Europe is submitting this type II variation (extension of indication) to register T-DXd, as 
a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-
positive  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction  (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma  who  have  received  a  prior  anti-
HER2-based regimen. The maximum recommended dose of T-DXd is 6.4 mg/kg, given as an intravenous 
infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Default PEC Calculation 
On average, the target number of drug-linker (deruxtecan) to 1 antibody molecule is 8. The molecular 
weight  of  deruxtecan  is  1034.05  and  the  molecular  weight  of  the  mAb  is  approximately  150,000  Da. 
Therefore, the total molecular weight of T-DXd is approximately 158,000 Da. On average 8 molecules of 
the active drug (DXd at 493.484 Da) are present on each molecule (8 × 493.484 = 3947.872 Da), thus 
DXd represents approximately 2.5% of the total dose of T-DXd (3947.872 ÷ 158 000 = 2.5%). 
The maximum recommended dose of T-DXd taken in one day is 6.4 mg/kg; which is given once every 3 
weeks for gastric cancer indications. Breast cancer indications require a lower dose and therefore are 
sufficiently covered assuming a worst-case daily dose of 6.4 mg/kg. Average body weight in Europe has 
been estimated to be approximately 70.8 kg (Walpole et al 2012). 
The maximum daily dose is calculated based on the maximum recommended dose which can be taken 
in one day (6.4 mg/kg) and the average weight of a European adult (6.4 mg/kg × 70.8 kg). A reduction 
Assessment report

Page 14/188 
 
 
 
is then applied to this maximum daily dose based on the percentage of total dose representing the active 
drug (2.5%); equivalent to 11.3 mg per day. 
In line with the conservative nature of the assessment, no consideration is given to the posology of the 
dose only being given once every 3 weeks. The calculation conservatively assumes the maximum daily 
dose is taken every day by all patients; this equates to an approximate 21-fold over estimate in the PEC. 
For example, the average daily dose taken by a patient receiving one dose per week would be equivalent 
to: 11.3 mg (maximum daily dose) ÷ 21 days (3 weeks) = 0.53 mg / day 
The default PECsurfacewater is above the PEC action limit for triggering a full ERA. As mentioned previously 
the PEC based on maximum daily dose is approximately 21-fold higher than if based on the actual dose 
regime  recommended  (once  every  3  weeks).  A  PEC  accounting  for  the  actual  dosing  regimen  would 
clearly  be  below  the  trigger  (≤0.01  μg/L);  however,  the  PEC  has  subsequently  been  refined  utilising 
prevalence data on the stated indication(s).

Refined PEC Calculation 
The disease prevalence has been used to estimate the refined PECsurfacewater for each individual indication. 
The total PECsurfacewater is then calculated as the sum of all the PECsurfacewaters for each indication. 
Breast Cancer 
The Globocan database estimates Belgium to be the European Member State with the highest prevalence 
of breast cancer; 1-year prevalence is 191.8 per 100 000 females (Globocan 2018; Appendix 2). The 
prevalence data is available on a ‘per female’ only; the prevalence rate therefore was adjusted to that 
of the total population assuming a 1:1 male: female ratio. As such, the single year prevalence for breast 
cancer in Belgium is estimated to be 191.8 per 200 000 to account for the equivalent numbers of males 
in the total population; equivalent to 95.9 per 100 000 total population. In addition, HER2-positive breast 
cancers have been demonstrated to account for approximately 20% and not more than 30% of all breast 
cancer sub-types (Wolff et al., 2013; Slamon et al., 1987; Hudis 2007). 
The worst-case Fpen used for dose calculation is therefore proposed to be refined to (30% × 0.000959) 
0.000288. The maximum daily dose is calculated based on the maximum recommended dose which can 
be taken in one day (5.4 mg/kg) and the average weight of a European adult (5.4 mg/kg × 70.8 kg). A 
reduction is then applied to this maximum daily dose based on the percentage of total dose representing 
the active drug (2.5%); equivalent to 9.56 mg per day. 
In line with the conservative nature of the assessment, no consideration is given to the posology of the 
dose only being given once every 3 weeks. The calculation conservatively assumes the maximum daily 
dose is taken every day by all patients; this equates to an approximate 21-fold over estimate in the PEC. 
For example, the average daily dose taken by a patient receiving one dose per week would be equivalent 
to: 9.56 mg (maximum daily dose) ÷ 21 days (3 weeks) = 0.45 mg / day

Gastric Cancer 
The  Globocan  database  estimates  Lithuania  to  be  the  European  Member  State  with  the  highest 
prevalence of gastric cancer; 1-year prevalence is 19.0 per 100 000 (Globocan 2018; Appendix 3). The 
worst-case Fpen used for dose calculation is therefore proposed to be 0.000190. 
The maximum daily dose is calculated based on the maximum recommended dose which can be taken 
in one day (6.4 mg/kg) and the average weight of a European adult (6.4 mg/kg × 70.8 kg). A reduction 
is then applied to this maximum daily dose based on the percentage of total dose representing the active 
drug (2.5%); equivalent to 11.3 mg per day. 
In line with the conservative nature of the assessment, no consideration is given to the posology of the 
dose only being given once every 3 weeks. The calculation conservatively assumes the maximum daily 
dose is taken every day by all patients; this equates to an approximate 21-fold over estimate in the PEC. 
For example, the average daily dose taken by a patient receiving one dose per week would be equivalent 
to: 11.3 mg (maximum daily dose) ÷ 21 days (3 weeks) = 0.53 mg / day 
or 
Combined PECsurfacewater 
The total or combined PECsurfacewater is calculated as the sum of all the refined PECsurfacewater 
values for each indication as detailed below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 17/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The refined PECsurfacewater is below the PEC action limit of 0.01 μg/L for triggering a full Phase II ERA. 
No Phase II ERA is therefore required or presented. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient DXd is a topoisomerase I inhibitor and is released from the mAb 
and linker portion of T-DXd upon binding to the target cell. Therefore, the environmental risk assessment 
considers this molecule in isolation. This is accepted, since the rest of the molecule can be considered of 
protein nature, which is susceptible to rapid degradation in the environment. 
The disease prevalence was used to estimate the refined PECsurfacewater for each individual indication. The 
total PECsurfacewater is then calculated as the sum of all the PECsurfacewater for each indication.  
Hence,  without  considering  the  posology  of  administration  once  every  3  weeks,  the  sum  of  the  two 
PECsurfacewaters is 
Which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and no further environmental risk assessment should be 
required. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, Trastuzumab deruxtecan is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (T-DXd)  is  a  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2)-targeted 
antibody  and  topoisomerase  I  inhibitor  conjugate  (ADC  molecule)  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (T-DXd dose 5.4 mg/kg) who have received two 
or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.  
The  present  application  concerns  approval  of  T-DXd  as  2L  monotherapy  (T-DXd  dose  6.4  mg/kg)  for 
treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. 
A  summary  of  the  studies  and  analyses  conducted  as  part  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  program  is 
provided in this section. The clinical pharmacology package for the initial BC  application included five 
studies (Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201). The package included in the current application 
includes  data  from  two  additional  Phase  2  studies  in  subjects  with  HER2-positive  advanced  GC  or 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (Studies J202 and U205). A list and brief descriptions 
of the seven studies that were conducted to evaluate the clinical pharmacological properties of T-DXd 
are shown in Table 1.1. In each study, serum concentrations of three analytes (intact antibody-drug 
conjugate T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and the topoisomerase I inhibitor DXd) were measured to 
characterize the PK of T-DXd. A randomised, 2-arm, open-label Phase 3 Study U306 is currently enrolling 
subjects with HER2-positive GC who have received a prior trastuzumab containing regimen (2L setting). 
This study started enrolment in 2021, therefore there are no data to present from this study.

Methods 
In addition to the studies listed above, population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and exposure-response (E-
R)  analyses  were  used  to  further  characterize  the  clinical  pharmacology  profile  of  T-DXd.  The  PopPK 
analysis developed for the initial BC application with data from five studies was updated with data from 
Study  J202,  and  was  further  updated  with  inclusion  of  data  from  Study  U205  (Table  1.1  –  List  of 
Clinical Pharmacology Studies). 
Results from the updated analysis including Study U205 are presented in this document. 
Bioanalysis 
The  same  bioanalytical  methods  used  to  quantify  the  three  moieties  from  T-DXd  and  to  detect  and 
confirm anti-T-DXd, or ADA in human serum, in the initial breast cancer application, were also used for 
bioanalysis conducted in studies J202 and U205. ADA positive samples were further analysed using a 
new validated cell-based assay for detection of NAb against T-DXd.  
The NAb method performance is summarised below:

Population PK analysis 
NONMEM (version 7.4.3) for nonlinear mixed-effects analysis (ICON, Hanover, MD, US) with FOCEI was 
used  for  PopPK  modelling.  Xpose  4  (version  4.6.1)  and  PsN  (version  4.8.1)  was  used  for  model 
diagnostics  and  covariate  testing.  R  (version  4.0.2  or  higher)  was  used  for  data  exploration  and 
simulations.  
A  previous  PopPK  analysis  for  trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (T-DXd,  intact  ADC)  was  based  on  data  from 
Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, U201 and J202 served as the starting point for model development. In 
this model the time-course of intact T-DXd concentrations, adjusted for the drug-antibody ratio of 8 and 
molar mass, was the input to the released drug model (Fig 3-1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 25/188 
 
 
 
 
An  updated  dataset  with  additional  dose  and  PK  observations  from  subjects  with  gastric  cancer  from 
studies J101 and J202 and new data from Study U205 (conducted in US/European patients) was used 
to re-estimate model parameters including covariate effects. Study U205 contributed a total of 779 T-
DXd and 778 DXd (only the topoisomerase I inhibitor) PK-evaluable samples from 76 subjects enrolled 
at study sites in USA and Europe. A total of 6 outlier concentrations in Study U205 were identified using 
a |CWRES|>5 criterion and excluded from covariate testing. No further data exclusions were conducted. 
The final combined T-DXd PopPK model were estimated using 14852 T-DXd and 14933 DXd PK samples 
collected from 884 subjects. Figure 4-5 shows the distribution of weights in the data set.

The prior model was fit to the updated dataset with re-estimation of parameters for T-DXd and covariate 
effects using the T-DXd PK data only. Then, using both the T-DXd and DXd data, DXd parameters and 
corresponding  covariate effects  were  re-estimated  with  fixed  estimates  for  T-DXd,  including the  fixed 
and random-effects terms. The final model for T-DXd was the same as the base model and comprised a 
two-compartment model with linear elimination. Numerous covariates appeared correlated (e.g., sex, 
cancer type, and body weight; age, body weight and creatinine clearance). Cancer type on CLT-DXd was 
retained in the base model (run331) while sex was not tested as a covariate. The PK of DXd was described 
by a one-compartment model with a two-component, time-varying release rate from T-DXd. The release 
rate (Krel) was modelled to decrease over time based on a term for constant reduction after Cycle 1 
(FPC1) and a term for gradual decline per cycle (FPC2). Covariate effects included in the final model are 
shown in Table 4-7 and 4-9 for intact T-DXd and DXd, respectively.

Model  parameters  were  estimated  with  good  precision  (RSE  <30%)  except  for  the  effect  of  “Other 
cancer” on CL,T-DXd, CL,DXd and V1,T-DXd. Shrinkage ranged up to 35%. BSV terms were included on 
CLDXd,  VDXd,  Krel,  and  FPC1.  RUV  was  modelled  with  a  proportional  error  structure.  The  RUV  was 
estimated to be  30%  with  6.6%  shrinkage.  Final model  parameters  for  T-DXd  and  DXd  are  shown in 
Tables 4-6 and 4-10. A sensitivity analysis of the final T-DXd PopPK model (run542) including CWRES 
outliers (run542s) was performed and found no large shifts in model parameters.

Covariate effects on exposure estimates 
In the previous model all covariates had effects contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 exposure ratios with 
the exceptions of high values of albumin for T-DXd which increased Cmin by 33% and gastric vs. breast

cancer for T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg Q3W. For DXd, high values of baseline AST increased AUC and Cmin by 
27%. In the updated model, post hoc DXd exposure estimates of subjects dosed at 6.4 mg/kg Q3W T-
DXd showed differences based on cancer type but not by sex, region and race-country. Presence of ADA 
was tested for T-DXd and line of therapy was tested for both T-DXd and DXd. None had significant effect.  
Subpopulation analyses of DXd exposures performed under proposed regimens based on T-DXd exposure 
differences,  5.4  mg/kg  Q3W  T-DXd  for  breast  cancer  and  6.4  mg/kg  Q3W  T-DXd  for  gastric  cancer, 
showed greater DXd exposure in the 6.4 mg/kg Q3W T-DXd gastric cancer group at Cycle 1 (up to 41% 
higher), but comparable exposures between the two groups at steady state (geometric mean ratio 1.12 
to 1.22). 
Exposure-response analyses 
The initial exposure-safety analysis used data from four Phase 1 studies (Studies J101, J102, A103, and 
A104) and two Phase 2 studies (Studies U201 and J202). Models were updated with data from U205 
(Table 3-3).  
R (version 4.0.5) was used for the exposure-efficacy/safety modeling, as well as for data explorations 
prior to and/or after modeling and simulations. Exploratory plots were used to assess whether to perform 
detailed modeling of each efficacy or safety endpoint. Covariates that were not significant (p>0.05 using 
z-test) were removed followed by a forward inclusion at p<0.05 and a backward elimination at p<0.01 
using the likelihood ratio test. The covariates were tested on the intercept and the slope of logistic ER 
relationships or on the slope of Cox regression models.

No statistically significant relationships between increasing T-DXd or DXd exposures and either PFS or 
DoR was detected over the range of exposures for the 6.4 mg/kg Q3W dose in Study U205. No covariate 
relationships were explored. 
Interpretation of model covariates, both presence in the model and in direction of effect, may be complex 
because  of  the  correlation  between  covariates,  multiplicity  of  testing,  sample  size  of  subgroups,  and 
unknown covariate status for some of the patients. 
Stratifying modelled event rates in gastric cancer by region (Asia, USA, Europe) showed more than 15% 
higher rates in Asia for Grade ≥3 AE, Grade ≥3 anaemia and Grade ≥3 neutropenia. Model-predicted 
safety event rates also showed this difference between Asians and Non-Asians and may be related to 
clinical practice. However, USA and European subjects had comparable AE rates across all endpoints, 
although the numbers of subjects in this comparison is small. 
Bridging analysis

A virtual second-line or later HER2-positive gastric cancer Western population was created from real-
world  (RW)  data.  Individual  longitudinal  information  in  HER2+  gastric  cancer  patients  in  the  US  was 
extracted from electronic health records of healthcare provider sites by a third-party vendor. Patients 
receiving one or more line of therapy were included in the RW dataset. For patients receiving more lines 
of therapy, baseline time was defined as the start time of the last received therapy. Covariates were 
taken from the visit corresponding to the baseline time, or nearest available visit, or indicated as missing. 
Per real-world patient, 50 virtual patients were simulated using the population PK model to obtain PK 
exposures  for  intact  antibody  and  released  drug.  Each  virtual  patient  utilized  the  corresponding 
covariates  of  the  real-world  patient,  except  for  imputed  covariates.  Missing  covariates  were  sampled 
from other patients in the RW dataset, or from the bridging population (Table 1.1 – Summary of Subject 
Populations  used  for  Bridging).  The  real-world  population  included  49  HER2-positive  gastric  cancer 
patients, of which 25 patients were identified as second-line or later and included in the Western RW 
dataset. The inclusion criteria were: patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, HER2-positive and received 
trastuzumab. Therefore, the virtual PK population included 1250 subjects.  
The PK model parameters were used to compute the exposure metrics Cmin, Cmax and AUC at Cycle 1 
and at steady-state (Cycle 9). Exposure metrics obtained in Japan and the virtual Western population 
were compared. For time-to-event exposure metrics, dose regimens and endpoint times were randomly 
sampled from the bridging population in Table 1.1 – Summary of Subject Populations used for Bridging. 
These  regimens  incorporated  dose  interruptions,  dose  reductions  and  treatment  discontinuations.  For 
each efficacy or safety endpoint, 1000 trial simulations were conducted. Each trial simulation used the 
RW dataset sample size, by sampling the virtual population with replacement. Each trial simulation also 
incorporated uncertainty in the exposure-response models by sampling parameters from the variance-
covariance matrix of the parameter estimates of the exposure-response models. Trial simulations were 
also conducted in the Japan gastric cancer bridging population as outlined in Table 1.1 for comparison. 
Each trial simulation provided an event probability. Across the 1000 trial simulations, 1000 probabilities 
were obtained to derive the 90% confidence intervals. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to elucidate 
the covariates accounting for differences between Japan and Western populations and illustrated using 
forest plots. 
The PK simulations results from the virtual bridging analysis indicated that in HER2-positive second-line-
or-later subjects with GC receiving 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd Q3W, PK exposures of intact T-DXd and DXd are 
generally comparable between Western and Japanese subjects with GC. Based on the exposure-efficacy 
simulations, there was a similar incidence of ucORR in Western subjects relative to Japanese subjects; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 36/188 
 
 
 
 
however, the incidence of cORR in Western subjects was lower relative to that in Japanese subjects. The 
results  from  exposure-safety  simulations  suggested  that  any  grade  ILD  was  lower  in  the  Japan 
population, and ILD3 rates in Japan and Western populations were comparable. The incidence of other 
TEAEs was comparable, with the exception of Grade ≥3 neutropenia, which was lower in Western subjects 
relative to Japanese subjects. 
The bridging analysis enabled projections of efficacy/safety rates for the 6.4 mg/kg Q3W T-DXd regimen 
in  Western  subjects,  prior  to  the  availability  of  results  from  Study  U205. In  general,  the  efficacy  and 
safety data from Study U205 agreed with the results of the virtual bridging analysis, thereby confirming 
the extrapolation of the results from the Asian patients with GC to Western patients with GC. 
ADME 
The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  characteristics  of  T-DXd  (and  each  individual 
component) are well characterized based on a series of nonclinical studies using human biomaterials as 
described in the initial BC application, and based on data from clinical studies J101, J102, A103, A104, 
and U201. 
PopPK modelling, based on a dataset updated with GC data, suggested that T-DXd clearance increased 
with body weight, baseline tumor size, and having GC or other cancers (relative to BC). 
Following  intravenous  administration  of  trastuzumab  deruxtecan  in  patients  with  metastatic 
HER2-positive  breast  cancer,  the  clearance  of  trastuzumab  deruxtecan  in  population  pharmacokinetic 
analysis was calculated to be 0.42 L/day. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma, trastuzumab deruxtecan clearance was 16% higher than in patients with metastatic 
HER2-positive breast cancer. The clearance of DXd based on population pharmacokinetic analysis was 
estimated to be 446 L/day and 401 L/day for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and 
locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, respectively. 
As  for DXd, the model identified body weight, total bilirubin, AST, coadministration of itraconazole or 
ritonavir, and having GC or other cancers as significant covariates on the clearance of DXd.  
Exposure data in GC or GEJ patients compared with BC data  
Serum T-DXd 
The cycle 1 PK data (calculated using noncompartmental methods) for T-DXd in subjects with GC and 
BC were integrated across six studies (J101, J102, A103, U201, J202, and U205) and PK parameters are 
presented by dose for subjects with HER2-positive GC and BC in Table 3.1. The PK exposure parameters 
for T-DXd in cycle 1 at 6.4 mg/kg for subjects with GC were similar to those at 5.4 mg/kg for subjects 
with BC.

Not addressed in the present application. 
Special populations 
A popPK analysis performed with an analysis dataset pooled from five studies (J101, J102, A103, A104, 
and U201) for the initial BC application was updated with inclusion of data from study J202 and U205. 
This analysis explored the exposures among subpopulations of interest, including tumor type, sex, race-
country, region, hepatic function, and renal function. 
Covariate Effect on DXd Pharmacokinetics 
The  effect  of  each  significant  covariate  included  in  the  final  model  on  the  AUCss  of  DXd  after 
administration of T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg Q3W was evaluated by forest plots (Figure 3.8). A typical subject 
who was administered T-DXd lyophilized drug product was a 65-year-old Asian subject with GC, body 
weight 59 kg, total bilirubin 8.6 μmol/L, and AST 26 U/L. The magnitude of all covariate effects on DXd 
exposure (Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUCss) was contained within a 0.8 to 1.25 ratio interval except for 
effects of extreme values of AST and body weight.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Clinical data 
No new drug drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against T-DXd were evaluated in subjects from Studies J202 and U205, and 
these data were combined with the data from the studies included in the initial BC application to provide 
an  integrated  immunogenicity  assessment  across  the  seven  clinical  studies  (J101,  J102,  A103,  A104, 
U201, J202, and U205). Immunogenicity data are summarized across all studies in Table 4.2.  
Immunogenicity data are summarized at baseline and post-treatment, which includes the incidence of 
treatment-emergent ADA-positive results. Across the clinical studies, 892 subjects were tested for ADAs 
against T-DXd, and the median duration of immunogenicity assessment was 25 weeks (range of median 
values across studies: 15.1 weeks to 39.0 weeks).  In general, the rate of baseline and post-baseline 
ADA-positive  immunogenicity  was  low  with  4.5%  and  2.4%  prevalence,  respectively.  The  rate  of 
treatment-emergent ADAs (defined as subjects who were ADA-negative at baseline and became ADA-
positive post-treatment; or subjects who were ADA-positive at baseline and post-treatment, but had an 
increase in ADA titer from baseline to posttreatment; or subjects who had missing ADA data at baseline 
and  were  ADA-positive  posttreatment)  continued  to  be  low,  with  1.8%  subjects  (16/892)  having 
treatment-emergent ADAs. No apparent difference was noted in the incidence of treatment-emergent 
ADAs  across  different  tumor  types.  None  of  the  treatment-emergent  ADA-positive  subjects  had 
neutralizing antibody (NAb)-positive samples. No obvious effect of immunogenicity on PK, efficacy, or 
Assessment report

safety  was  observed.  No  apparent  impact  of  ADA  positivity  on  systemic  concentrations  of  T-DXd  was 
noted. The population PK analysis confirmed lack of an impact of ADA status on the CLT-DXd. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (T-DXd)  is  a  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2)-targeted 
antibody linked to topoisomerase I inhibitor molecules (ADC molecule). DXd acts as a cytotoxic payload.

Exposure-efficacy analysis 
For the E-R analysis for efficacy, data from subjects with HER2-positive GC were analysed separately 
using  an  integrated  dataset  from  Studies  J101  and  J202  and  a  dataset  from  Study  U205.  For  the 
Assessment report

integrated analysis of Studies J101 and J202, 160 subjects were included, with the median age being 66 
years  and  male  subjects  accounting  for 74%; the  study  subjects  were  from  Japan  (82%),  non-Japan 
Asia  (South  Korea)  (15%),  and  non-Asia  (3%).  For  the  analysis  of  Study  U205,  76  subjects  were 
included, with the median age being 61.5 years and male subjects accounting for 72.4%.  
The exposure indicators investigated were the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of T-DXd and DXd in Cycle 1 and 
at steady state, and Cavg during the period up to the development of the efficacy event under analysis. 
The efficacy endpoints were cORR, DoR, and PFS in subjects with HER2-positive GC. 
None of the T-DXd or DXd exposure metrics had a statistically significant relationship with the primary 
efficacy endpoint of ucORR. 
In the integrated analysis of Studies J101 and J202, the analysis of cORR by logistic regression showed 
that  cORR  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  subjects  with  higher  Cmin,ss  of  T-DXd  (P  =  0.023; 
Figure 3.13). 
In  the  analysis  of  Study  U205,  cORR  by  logistic  regression  showed  that  cORR  was  not  statistically 
significantly higher in subjects with higher Cmin,ss of T-DXd (P = 0.591; Figure 3.14).

An integrated dataset across five clinical studies (J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201) for the initial BC 
application was updated with inclusion of data from Study J202 and then further updated with inclusion 
of  data  from  Study  U205.  The  most  recently  updated  report  included  884  subjects  with  GC,  BC,  and 
other  tumors  for  the  E-R  analysis  for  key  safety  endpoints.  The  safety  endpoints  and  the  exposure 
metrics  evaluated  in the  current  analysis  are  consistent  with those evaluated in  the  analysis  updated 
with data from Study J202 and the analysis included in the initial BC application. The analysis set was

The model-predicted E-R relationships for safety events were used to estimate the probability of 
each safety variable for 5.4 mg/kg doses in subjects with BC and 6.4 mg/kg doses in subjects with GC 
(Table 3.7). The incidence of these safety endpoints at the 6.4 mg/kg dose in subjects with GC was 
estimated to be generally comparable to the 5.4 mg/kg dose in subjects with BC with the exception of 
Grade ≥3 TEAE, SAEs, anemia Grade ≥3, and neutropenia Grade ≥3, which were predicted to be >10% 
higher at the 6.4 mg/kg dose in subjects with GC.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology package included in the current application includes data from two additional Phase 
2  studies  in  subjects  with  HER2-positive  advanced  GC  or  gastroesophageal  junction  (GEJ) 
adenocarcinoma (Studies J202 and U205). 
No new bioanalytical methods were applied for detection of the three moieties from T-DXd or ADA in 
Study J202 and U205. A new NAb assay was developed. No NAbs were detected in any samples. 
The  PK  for  T-DXd  was  described  by  a  two-compartment  model  with  IV  infusion  input  and  linear 
elimination  which  also  served  as  the  input  to  the  released  drug  model  DXd.  The  DXd  formation  was 
described by a one-compartment model with a two-component time-varying release rate (Krel) from T-
DXd. Krel was modelled to decrease as a constant reduction after Cycle 1 (FPC1) and as gradual decline 
per cycle (FPC2). The PK data for Western GC patients is considered rather limited and the Pop PK model 
could not adequately describe this population.  
A bridging analysis between Asian and Western population was conducted using a virtual second-line or 
later  HER2-positive  gastric  cancer  Western  population  by  use  of  real-world  data  from  gastric  cancer 
patients  in  the  US  treated  with  trastuzumab  deruxtecan.  The  PK/efficacy  and  safety  predictions  were 
largely comparable to the data achieved in Study U205 (US/European patients with HER2 gastric cancer, 
n=79).  The  virtual  RWD  analysis  in  Western  subjects  is  not  considered  sufficiently  reliable  nor 
representative of an entire population to bridge to the Asian population. 
The ADME characteristics were described in the original BC marketing application. Based on 
the efficacy and safety results observed when comparing the 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg doses, the 
selected dose of 6.4 mg/kg Q3W in GC patients is considered acceptable. In section 5.2 of 
the SmPC, the value of DXd clearance has been changed from 19.2 L/h to 18.5 L/h due to 
new data included in the model (see SmPC for new issue). “The clearance of DXd based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 18.6 L/h and 16.7 L/h for patients 
with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and locally advanced or metastatic gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma, respectively.”  
18.6 L/h x 24 = 446.4 L/day 
16.7 L/h x 24 = 400.8 L/day 
The  exposure  parameters in  cycle  1  for  DXd,  the  cytotoxic  payload  of  T-DXd,  is  slightly  higher in  GC 
subjects receiving either 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg compared with BC subjects receiving the same doses.  
PopPK analyses show that the covariates of interest, except from an impact of extreme weight (5th and 
95th percentile) and high AST, do not affect the PK of DXd compared with the reference subject. None of 
the estimated values are considered to have a clinically meaningful impact on DXd PK.

No new clinical DDI studies have been conducted since the BC application.  
Across all studies, the rate of treatment-emergent ADAs was low (1.8% of the subjects (16/892)). No 
treatment-emergent Nab-positive samples were found.  
Exposure-response  analyses  were  performed  using  data  from  Study  U205.    The  exposure-response 
models  were  linear logistic  regression  models,  except  for  interstitial  lung disease  endpoints,  DoR  and 
PFS,  which  were  linear  Cox  regression  models.  No  relation  to  exposure  was  found  for  the  efficacy 
endpoints. No covariates were tested on the intercept and slope terms for ORR or on the slope term for 
PFS and DoR. In general, race-country had impact on the slope term for most safety endpoints. 
Exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd in the first cycle  were 16% and 9% higher in subjects 
with GC in study U205 compared to subjects in study J202. This is likely related to the higher bodyweight 
of subjects in study U205 vs J202, 75 kg vs 57 kg, respectively, and consequently higher doses. Based 
on the currently available data, capping the dose for subjects with higher body weight is not necessary. 
For  subjects  in  study  U205,  there  was  no  clear  correlation  between  body-weight  and  AEs  except  for 
thrombocytopenia  and  to  lesser  extent  for  neutropenia  any  grade,  but  this  did  not  result  in  more 
discontinuations due to AEs in subjects in the 75th percentile body-weight compared to subjects with a 
lower body-weight.   
The flat exposure-efficacy relationship while exposure-safety relationships were generally steeper with 
higher exposures of trastuzumab deruxtecan and/or DXd were for the breast cancer indication reason to 
select the 5.4 mg/kg Q3W over the 6.4 mg/kg Q3W. It could be argued that the lower dose of 5.4 mg/kg 
Q3W might also be preferred for the treatment of GC because of the steep exposure-safety relationship 
and the lower AEs incidence observed for 5.4 mg/kg vs 6.4 mg/kg in breast cancer. However, there is 
insufficient data for trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment of GC other than with 6.4 mg/kg Q3W. Hence, 
the  benefit-risk  assessment  for  trastuzumab  deruxtecan  for  treatment  of  HER2-positive  advanced  GC 
should be based on 6.4 mg/kg dose (see also B/R). It is, however, unknown if the optimal dose has been 
selected. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology package included in the current application includes data from two additional Phase 
2  studies  in  the  intended  patient  population  and  is  considered  adequate  to  support  the  extension  of 
indication as 2L monotherapy (T-DXd dose 6.4 mg/kg) for treatment of patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The sought new therapeutic indication of Enhertu for advanced HER2+ GC/GEJC  in the 2L+ setting (after 
a prior trastuzumab-based regimen) is based on efficacy data from the pivotal single-arm phase II trial 
DS8201-A-U205 (DESTINY-Gastric02), which took place in Europe and the USA.  
Results from phase II study DS8201-A-J202 (DESTINY-Gastric01), a randomised controlled trial in 
the third line setting in patients from Japan and South Korea, are considered supportive.

A  completed  phase  1,  multicenter,  2-part  (dose  escalation  followed  by  dose  expansion),  open-label, 
nonrandomized, multiple-dose first-in-human (FIH) study conducted in the US and Japan in several types 
of  advanced  solid  malignant  tumours  that  contributed  44  subjects  with  pre-treated  metastatic  HER2-
positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had received prior trastuzumab and were treated at 1 of 2 
doses in the study: the 6.4 mg/kg target dose (N = 25) or a 5.4 mg/kg dose (N = 19). 
Study D967LC00001 (DESTINY-Gastric03): 
An on-going Phase 1b/2 open-label 2-part dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2) study, 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of T-
DXd 6.4 mg/kg monotherapy and combinations in adult subjects with HER2-positive GC. As of 01 Aug 
2021, 100 subjects have been enrolled and treated. 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  finished  phase  1  dose  escalation  study  followed  by  dose  expansion  in  44 
subjects. This has been followed by a larger on-going Phase 1b/2 open-label 2-part dose escalation (Part 
1)  and  dose  expansion  (Part  2)  study,  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK), 
immunogenicity,  and  antitumor  activity  of  T-DXd  6.4  mg/kg  monotherapy  and  combinations  in  adult 
subjects with HER2-positive GC. The Applicant did not submit dose response studies to justify the higher 
proposed posology in gastric cancer. The Applicant considers the ICH E4 requirements on dose-response 
evaluation were addressed by the analyses described above and the dose-response relationship in the 
BC population. However, it is not agreed with the Applicant that ICH E4 requirements are addressed. 
Trastuzumab  deruxtecan  is  considered  to  be  a  molecularly  targeted  agent  (MTA).  In  particular  in  the 
case of dose-finding for MTAs, the dose-finding strategy should not only focus on safety endpoints, but 
also on determining an optimal biologically active dose (alternatively termed “optimal biological dose” or 
“optimum biologic dose”) (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.6). This refers to a dose at which optimal biological 
response  according  to  a  predefined  effect  marker  is  achieved  (e.g.  as  determined  in  tumour  tissue 
response) and giving a higher dose does not further improve outcomes  (i.e. a dose somewhere at the 
beginning of the plateau of the dose–response curve). Identification of the beginning of the plateau on 
the dose response curve is not possible with two studied doses (6.4 mg/kg target dose (N = 25) or a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 63/188 
 
 
 
 
5.4 mg/kg dose (N = 19). At least three doses in a sufficient number of patients are required to identify 
the plateau on the dose response curve. 
Approval decisions are based on a consideration of the totality of information on a drug. Although dose-
response  information  should  be  available,  depending  on  the  kind  and  degree  of  effectiveness  shown, 
imperfections in the database may be acceptable with the expectation that further studies will be carried 
out after approval (CPMP/ICH/378/95). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study U205 (DESTINY-Gastric02) 
Study U205 was a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of  T-DXd  (6.4  mg/kg  as  IV  infusion  Q3W)  in  subjects  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  HER2-positive 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed during or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen 
(2L). The study was conducted in a Western population at 24 sites in the US and Europe. The primary 
efficacy analysis of confirmed ORR by ICR has been completed.

Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of T-DXd based on confirmed ORR, as 
assessed by an independent central imaging facility review (ICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, in subjects with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma that had progressed on or after a trastuzumab containing regimen. 
Secondary Objectives 
The key secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of T-DXd on progression-free survival (PFS), 
based on ICR using RECIST v1.1. 
Other secondary objectives were as follows: 
- OS 
- PFS, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1 
- ORR, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1 
- Duration of response (DoR), based on ICR and investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1

- To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of T-DXd in serum 
-  To  further  evaluate  the safety  of  T-DXd  based  on  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  and 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
- To evaluate Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) endpoints based on patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) 
Exploratory Objectives 
- Disease control rate (DCR), based on ICR and investigator assessment 
- Time to response, based on both ICR and investigator assessment 
- Best percentage change in the sum of diameters of measurable tumors 
- Predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic exploratory biomarkers in tissue samples and blood, and 
their association with disease status and/or response to treatment 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a 
best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), 
as determined by ICR using RECIST v1.1. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was PFS, based on ICR, defined as the time from the date of the 
first dose of study drug to the date of radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death due to 
any  cause.  Subjects  who  were  alive  with  no  objective  documentation  of  (radiographic)  disease 
progression  by  the  data  cut-off  (DCO)  date  for  PFS  analysis  were  censored  at  the  date  of  their  last 
evaluable tumor assessment. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
- OS, defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause 
- PFS, defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of disease progression or 
death due to any cause based on investigator assessment 
- ORR, based on investigator assessment 
- DoR, defined as the time from the date of first documentation of objective response to the date of the 
first documentation of disease progression, based on ICR and investigator assessment, or to death due 
to any cause, using RECIST v1.1 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the following: 
-  DCR,  based  on  both  ICR  and  investigator  assessment,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  who 
achieved a BOR of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) 
- Time to response, based on both ICR and investigator assessment 
- Best percentage change in the sum of diameters of measurable tumors

Sample size 
The target sample size of this study was 79 subjects. 
On  the  basis  of  historical  data  of  current  SoC,  Western  subjects  with  second-line  gastric  or  GEJ 
adenocarcinoma have reported an ORR of approximately 27%. Seventy-two subjects provided a 90% 
power to achieve a lower limit of 95% CI for the ORR that exceeded 27% (threshold) under the expected 
ORR of 45%. Taking into consideration potential dropouts, a sample size of approximately 80 subjects 
was recruited. The sample size computation was performed by using EAST v6.4. 
Randomisation 
U205 study was a single-arm study, randomisation did not take place. 
Blinding (masking) 
U205 study was an open-label study, and no blinding was performed.

Primary endpoint ORR 
The  estimate  of  ORR  was  calculated,  along  with  the  corresponding  95%  exact  CI  using  the  Clopper-
Pearson method. The primary efficacy analysis was performed based on the FAS and repeated on the 
RES. 
Key secondary endpoint PFS 
Subjects  who  were  alive  with  no  objective  documentation  of  radiographic  disease  progression  as 
assessed  by  ICR  were  censored  at  the  date  of  their  last  adequate  tumor  assessment  with  additional 
censoring rules specified in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.4). Kaplan-Meier estimate and survival curve were 
presented. The median event time and the corresponding 95% CI were provided using the Brookmeyer 
and Crowley method. PFS rates at fixed time points along with the 95% CIs were estimated. The PFS 
analysis was performed on the FAS. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
All  analyses  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  based  on  the  FAS,  unless  otherwise 
specified. 
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed as follows: 
-  PFS by investigator assessment was analyzed in the same way as that used for PFS based on ICR. PFS 
based on ICR and investigator assessment were compared to assess the concordance. 
- OS: If a subject was alive at the time of data analysis, OS was censored at the last contact date at 
which the subject was known to be alive. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and survival curve were presented. 
The median event time and the corresponding 95% CI were provided using Brookmeyer and Crowley 
method. The proportion of subjects alive at fixed time points was also estimated. 
-  ORR  based  on  investigator  assessment,  measured  for  responding  subjects  (PR  or  CR)  only,  was 
analyzed in a similar manner as used for the primary endpoint. 
- DoR was measured for responding subjects (PR or CR) only. Subjects who were alive and progression-
free at the time of the analyses were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment. DoR 
based on ICR and investigator assessment was summarized separately with median event times and its 
95%  CIs  using  the  Brookmeyer  and  Crowley  method.  A  swimmer’s  plot  for  response  over  time  was 
provided. 
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
DCR was defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR of CR, PR or SD according to RECIST v1.1. DCR 
was calculated, along with the corresponding 95% exact CI using Clopper-Pearson method. 
Time to response was defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first 
documentation  of  objective  response  (CR  or  PR).  Time  to  response  was  measured  for  subjects  with 
confirmed response (confirmed BOR of CR or PR) only. Time to response based on ICR and investigator 
assessment was summarized separately with median event times and their 95% CIs for the median by 
using Brookmeyer and Crowley method. 
Best percent change from baseline in the sum of diameters of measurable tumours was calculated based 
on RECIST v1.1 criteria. Best percent change was the percent change in the smallest sum of diameters 
from all post-baseline tumor assessments, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. The closest 
tumor measurement prior to the date of start of treatment was used as the baseline tumor measurement. 
Best percentage change in tumor size was graphed by using a waterfall plot and spider plot.

The following subgroups were examined for the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR based on ICR, PFS 
based on ICR, and DoR based on ICR to assess homogeneity of estimate of treatment effect: region, 
age,  sex,  ECOG  PS,  HER2  status,  primary  tumor  location,  histological  subtype,  number  of  metastatic 
sites,  previous  total  gastrectomy,  prior  adjuvant/neoadjuvant  therapy,  prior  nivolumab  or 
pembrolizumab treatment, prior treatment with immuno-checkpoint inhibitor or other immuno-oncology 
therapy, presence of liver metastasis at baseline, renal impairment at baseline, and hepatic impairment 
at  baseline.  In  each  subgroup,  the  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the  same  type  of  methodology  as 
described  for  the  corresponding  endpoint.  Results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  presented  using 
descriptive  summaries.  Some  subcategories  may  have  been  combined  if  the  sample  size  within 
categories was too small (eg, <10 subjects). A forest plot was used to depict the estimated treatment 
effects for the corresponding endpoints. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
The SAP (Version 1.0, 18 Nov 2020) was amended (Version 2.0 08 April 2021) primarily driven by the 
updated  safety  information  to  be  include  in  the  selected  adverse  events  and  addition  of  analysis 
subgroups. Other minor changes are administrative and/or editorial.

Conduct of the study 
After the initial release (v1.0, 23 Apr 2019), the study protocol was amended 2 times. 
Key changes in the amendments were as follows: 
Amendment 1 (v2.0) - 28 Jul 2020, During the Course of the Study Version 2.0 was an interim version 
that was not sent to the study sites as it was found to contain typographical errors. All changes from 
v2.0 were included in v3.0.

Amendment  2  (v3.0)  -  17  Sep  2020,  During  the  Course  of  the  Study  The  primary  changes  made  by 
Amendment 2 were as follows: 
-  Because of the potential impact of COVID-19 on subject safety, the Sponsor added a dose modification 
and management plan for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 while being treated with T-
DXd. 
-  To  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  global  pandemic  caused  by  COVID-19,  added  an  analysis  to  identify 
subjects affected by COVID-19, and updated the analysis plan to identify the impact of COVID-19 on 
safety, efficacy, and study conduct. 
-  Updated  the  inclusion  criteria  related  to  male  and  female  subjects  of  reproductive/childbearing 
potential. 
- Removed exclusion criteria related to significant corneal disease and to current treatment with strong 
cytochrome P450 3A4 and organic anion transporting polypeptide inhibitors. 
-  Added  exclusion  criteria  related  to  clinically  severe  pulmonary  compromise  within  3  months  of  first 
dose and to antibody-based therapy within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1. 
- The description of determining dose based on body weight was updated. 
- Updated safety information to align with the latest safety information. 
- Included cell-free RNA for biomarker analysis. 
-  “Health  care  resource  utilization  (hospitalization-related  records)”  was  deleted  from  list  of  HEOR 
endpoints. 
 Updated the EOT Visit to provide the conditions under which EOT assessments were to be performed. 
Protocol deviations 
A  major  protocol  deviation  was  defined  as  a  deviation  that  had  an  impact  on  subject  safety,  could 
substantially alter risks to subjects, could have an effect on the integrity of study data, could influence 
the conduct of the study, or could affect the subject's willingness to participate in the study.

Supportive studies 
Study DS8201-A-J202 (DESTINY-Gastric01) 
This was a Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, randomized study in subjects with advanced HER2-positive 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on 2 or more prior regimens that had to include a 
fluoropyrimidine agent (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or S-1) and a platinum agent (oxaliplatin or cisplatin) 
(3L). The study was conducted at sites in Japan and South Korea. Subjects were divided into 3 cohorts 
based on HER2 status and prior therapy with trastuzumab. The target population that is the focus of this 
application  is  the  cohort  of  subjects  with  HER2-positive  (i.e.,  IHC  3+  or  IHC  2+/in  situ  hybridization 
[ISH]-positive)  tumours  (HER2  status  could  be  determined  either  pre-  or  post-trastuzumab)  in  the 
Primary Cohort (N=188), in which subjects were randomized to receive either T-DXd monotherapy at 
the proposed dose (6.4 mg/kg Q3W) or treatment of physician’s choice (TPC), (N=45), (limited to 1 of 
2 choices of standard regimens: irinotecan or paclitaxel in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects in the Primary Cohort 
had to have progressed on prior trastuzumab or a trastuzumab biosimilar in addition to a fluoropyrimidine 
agent and a platinum agent (i.e., 2 or more prior therapies). Subjects with a HER2 status of IHC 2+/ISH-
negative  or  IHC  1+  and  treatment-naïve  for  trastuzumab  were  enrolled  in  the  nonrandomized 
Exploratory Cohort 1 and Exploratory Cohort 2, respectively, and are not the focus of this application.

Study participants 
In Study J202, demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the ITT population were generally 
balanced  between  treatment  arms  (see  Module  2.7.3  Table  3.7  and  Module  5.3.5.3  J202  SCE  Table 
14.1.2.1_1): 
•  All subjects were Asian and were mostly from Japan (T-DXd: 79.4%; TPC: 80.6%). 
•  A majority of subjects were male (T-DXd: 76.2%; TPC: 75.8%) and the median age at informed 
consent was 65.5 years for the T-DXd arm and 66.0 years for the TPC arm. 
• 
There was a similar proportion of subjects with an ECOG PS of 0 (T-DXd: 49.2% ; TPC 48.4%) 
or 1 (T-DXd: 50.0% ; TPC 51.6%) in both treatment arms. 
•  A majority of subjects had GC (T-DXd: 86.5%; TPC: 88.7%) as opposed to GEJ (T-DXd: 13.5%; 
TPC: 11.3%), with most having Stage IV cancer at study entry (T-DXd: 96.0%; TPC: 100.0%). 
• 
The cancer was classified as “inoperable advanced” in 61.1% of subjects on T-DXd and 74.2% 
of those on TPC, and as “postoperative advanced” in 38.9% and 25.8% of subjects, respectively. 
•  A majority of subjects had the intestinal histologic subtype (T-DXd: 70.6%; TPC: 61.3%). 
•  All subjects had tumors with an HER2 status of IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH-positive based on central 
laboratory  testing  of  most  recent  archived  tumor  tissue  sample.  If  archived  sample  was  not 
available, a new sample was required as per protocol. 
• 
Prior treatment included cancer surgery for 44.1% of subjects (T-DXd: 47.6%; TPC: 37.1%): 
16.5% of subjects had prior total gastrectomy (T-DXd: 17.5%; TPC: 14.5%); 21.8% had prior 
partial gastrectomy (T-DXd: 23.8%; TPC: 17.7%); and 11.7% had “other” cancer surgery (T-
DXd: 11.1%; TPC: 12.9%). 
•  12.8% of subjects had prior radiation therapy (T-DXd: 11.1%; TPC: 16.1%). 
•  21.3%  of  subjects  had  received  prior  adjuvant/neoadjuvant  therapy  (T-DXd:  23.8%;  TPC: 
16.1%). 
• 
The median number of prior anticancer regimens in the locally advanced or metastatic setting 
excluding radiation and surgery was 2.0 (range: 2 to 9) in the T-DXd arm and 2.0 (range: 2 to 
5)  in  the  TPC  arm  (Note:  this  included  therapies  intended  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
disease or for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy if there was progressive disease within 6 months 
since the end of therapy). A higher proportion of subjects had received 4 or more prior regimens 
in the T-DXd arm than in the TPC arm (20.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively). 
• 
The most common prior anticancer agents were trastuzumab or a biosimilar (100.0% of subjects 
in  both  arms  as  per  protocol),  capecitabine  (T-DXd:  74.6%;  TPC:  66.1%),  cisplatin  (T-DXd: 
63.5%; TPC: 59.7%), PTX (T-DXd: 68.3%; TPC: 74.2%), Ram (T-DXd: 74.6%; TPC: 66.1%), 
oxaliplatin (T-DXd: 49.2%; TPC: 43.5%), and S-1 (T-DXd: 49.2%; TPC: 46.8%). In addition, 
27.0% of subjects in the T-DXd arm and 24.2% of subjects in the TPC arm had received prior 
nivolumab. Both S-1 and nivolumab are approved for use in Japan in this setting. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to receive either T-DXd monotherapy at the proposed dose (6.4 mg/kg 
Q3W) or treatment of physician’s choice (TPC).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 88/188 
 
 
 
 
Therapeutic options in the TPC arm were limited to 1 of 2 choices: irinotecan (N = 55) or paclitaxel (N 
= 7) and the investigator had to preselect TPC therapy before the subject was randomized. 
Randomization was stratified by region (Japan or South Korea), ECOG PS (0 or 1), and HER2 status 
(IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH-positive) (HER2 status was confirmed from the most recent archival tumour 
sample or determined on a new tissue sample, i.e., either   pre- or post-trastuzumab). 
Tumour assessments were performed at screening and every 6 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter from Cycle 
1 Day 1 until progressive disease, start of a new anticancer treatment, death, or withdrawal of consent 
by the subject. Assessments were conducted using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Copies of CT or MRI images were provided to a blinded ICR. 
Prior therapies required for randomization in the Primary Cohort (i.e., a fluoropyrimidine agent, a 
platinum agent, and trastuzumab) and the choice of irinotecan or PTX as active controls for the 
comparator arm in the third-line setting or later reflected the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment 
Guidelines 2018 (5th edition) at the time of study planning and were aligned with the 2018 Korean12 
Practice Guideline. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR (the sum of CR rate and PR rate), without confirmation of CR/PR, 
assessed by the ICR based on RECIST Version 1.1 (for the Primary Cohort only). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  following,  which  were  assessed  by  the  ICR  unless 
otherwise indicated. 
• OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization (the date of the registration for the Exploratory 
Cohorts) to the date of death due to any cause. 
• PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization (the date of the registration for the Exploratory 
Cohorts) to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of PD or death due to any cause. The 
PD was determined based on RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. 
• Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective 
response (CR or PR) to the date of the first objective documentation of PD or death due to any cause. 
DoR was measured for responding subjects (PR or CR) only. 
• Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the sum of CR rate, PR rate, and stable disease (SD) rate. 
• Time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the time from the date of randomization (the date of the 
registration for Exploratory Cohorts) to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of PD, death 
due to any cause, or treatment discontinuation. 
• ORR assessed by the investigator based on RECIST Version 1.1, defined as the sum of CR rate and PR 
rate, assessed by the investigator. 
Sample size 
The target sample size of this study was approximately 220 subjects (Primary Cohort, N=approximately 
180; Exploratory Cohort 1, N=approximately 20; and Exploratory Cohort 2, N=approximately 20). 
Primary Cohort 
A combined analysis of ORR data taken from published Phase 2 and 3 studies (a total of 13 studies) of 
second- or subsequent-line chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer was conducted. As a result, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 89/188 
 
 
 
combined  ORR  was  9.4%  (95%  CI:  1.1%  to  17.7%).  The  ORR  for  the  physician’s  choice  group  was 
conservatively assumed to be 15%, which exceeded the above-mentioned combined mean estimate of 
ORR. The ORR for the DS-8201a group was also assumed to be 40%. The sample size of 180 subjects 
(120 subjects in the DS-8201a group and 60 subjects in the physician’s choice group) could provide a 
92.9%  power  to  detect  this  magnitude  of  difference  according  to  Fisher’s  exact  test  with  2-sided 
significance alpha=0.05. 
Approximately 133 OS events would be needed to detect an HR of 0.61 for OS (a 64% improvement in 
median OS from 5.5 months in the physician’s choice group to 9.0 months in the DS-8201a group) with 
2-sided  significance  alpha=0.05  and  80%  power.  The  sample  size  of  180  subjects  could  provide  an 
80.8% power to detect this magnitude of OS difference, assuming a 10-month enrolment period and a 
12-month follow-up period after the last subject randomization. 
The sample size was calculated assuming that the ORR for the control arm would be approximately 15% 
and that the ORR for DS-8201a would be 40%. The MAH estimated that 120 and 60 subjects would be 
required to observe the mentioned difference with 93% power using a Fisher’s exact test. Of note, the 
CMH test was implemented in the primary analysis, and therefore the expected power for the primary 
analysis was not reported. 
The MAH expected to observe a HR of 0.61 or lower for OS with approximately 80% power if 133 OS are 
included in the analysis.  
Exploratory Cohorts 
The exploratory cohorts are not the scope of this assessment. 
Randomisation 
Subjects in Primary Cohort were randomized by IXRS into the two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (120 
DS-8201a  group  and  60  physician’s  choice  group)  and  the  randomization  will  be  stratified  by  region, 
ECOG PS, and HER2 status: 
•  Region (Japan or Korea) 
• 
ECOG PS (0 or 1) 
•  HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH +) 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  an  open-label  study,  and  no  blinding  was  performed.  It  was  not  feasible  to  blind  treatment 
allocations  for  individual  subjects  because  of  different  treatment  schedules  and  different  AE  profiles 
between DS-8201a and the physician’s choice treatment. 
To reduce potential bias, ICR reviewers were blinded to the treatment assignment when assessing the 
primary endpoint of ORR. Additionally, the sponsor was not allowed to have access to aggregate efficacy 
data except when data from both the DS-8201a and the physician’s choice groups were combined in the 
Primary Cohort. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The efficacy analyses were conducted on the following analysis sets: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 90/188 
 
 
 
 
 
      •  The Enrolled Analysis Set included all subjects who signed the ICF and were enrolled in the study. 
      •  The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set, which included all randomized subjects. 
      •  The FAS, which included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
      •  The Response Evaluable Set (RES), defined as randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug and had measurable disease per ICR at baseline. 
Analyses of ORR and DCR will be performed on the Response Evaluable Set. The other efficacy analyses 
will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS). 
Several analysis sets were used for the primary analysis. The intent-to-treat analysis set (ITT) includes 
as randomized subjects while the Full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug. The Response evaluable set (RES) includes all randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug and had measurable disease at baseline according to the ICR.  
For the primary endpoint ORR, the response evaluable set was the RES and for OS was the FAS. The use 
of RES and FAS  as primary analysis set is not endorsed. From a regulatory point of view, the results 
obtained with the ITT set are the most relevant ones since they follow the intention to treat principle. 
According to Table 7.1 in the CSR (page 80 /202), there was one participant randomized to study arm 
DS-8201a who was excluded from the FAS and several participants were excluded from the RES (7 and 
4 for the DS-8201a and control arm, respectively). 
Primary endpoint ORR 
Objective  response  rate  was  compared  between  treatment  arms  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test, with region (Japan or South Korea) as a stratification factor, for statistical significance at 2-
sided alpha=0.05. 
If  there  is  no  on-treatment  tumour  assessment,  the  best  overall  response  will  be  assigned  as 
“Inevaluable”.  In  the  case  of  a  best  overall  response  of  SD,  tumour  measurements  and  assessments 
must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum time interval from the date 
of first dose of study drug, 6 weeks (± 7 days). If this minimum requirement is not met, the best overall 
response  will  be  determined  starting  with  the  next  tumour  assessment.  If  there  is  no  next  tumour 
assessment, the best overall response will be assigned as “Inevaluable”. If a subject has no on-treatment 
tumour assessment, the best overall response of the subject will be assigned as “Inevaluable”. 
Subjects without on-treatment tumour assessment will be included in the denominators of best overall 
response and ORR (as best overall response of “Inevaluable”). 
Secondary endpoint OS 
OS  will  be  compared  between  the  treatment  groups  using  stratified  log-rank  tests  with  region  as  a 
stratification factor in Primary Cohort. 
The HRs and their 95% CI will be estimated using stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models 
with region as a stratification factor. Kaplan-Meier estimates and survival curves will be presented for 
each cohort/treatment group. The HRs over time will be also plotted. The unstratified results will also be 
provided as a sensitivity analysis. 
Censoring rules for OS 
If there is no death reported for a subject before the data cut-off for OS analysis, OS will be censored at 
the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 91/188 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoint PFS 
PFS will be analysed as described for OS. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
Subjects who are alive and progression-free at the data cut-off date will be censored at the date of the 
last evaluable tumour assessment.   
Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to the first post-baseline evaluable tumour assessment 
for a reason other than disease progression or death will be censored at the date of randomization (the 
date of the registration for Exploratory Cohorts). 
Subjects who discontinue from the study without disease progression and death will be censored at the 
date of the last evaluable tumour evaluation. 
Subjects who start other anti-cancer therapy prior to disease progression or death will be censored at 
the date of the last tumour evaluable assessment prior to starting new anti-cancer therapy. 
Subjects  who  progress  or  die  after  missing  ≥2  consecutive  scheduled  tumour  assessments  will  be 
censored at the date of the last evaluable tumour evaluation prior to progression or death.   
Subjects without baseline evaluable tumour assessment will be censored at the date of randomization 
or  registration  (the  date  of  the  registration  for  Exploratory  Cohorts),  except  death  within  the  first  2 
scheduled tumour assessments (i.e., 14 weeks) will be considered as a PFS event.Interim analysis 
One formal interim OS analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed tumour assessment 
approximately at 24 weeks (or discontinued the study) in Primary Cohort if the OS events observed thus 
far do not reach the target number of OS events (i.e., 133 OS events in Primary Cohort). The interim 
OS will be tested only if ORR show the statistical significance at 2-sided alpha = 0.05. The overall one-
sided alpha is to be controlled at 0.025 for the interim OS analysis and final OS analysis using the Lan-
De Mets alpha-spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. The boundary used at the interim 
and final OS analysis depends on the actual number of observed deaths at the interim analysis. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
The  primary  and  specified  secondary  endpoints  will  be  analysed  using  a  hierarchically  ordered 
gatekeeping testing procedure to control overall type I error at a significance level of a 2-sided alpha of 
0.05  and  allow  the  secondary  analysis  results  to  be  claimed  in  the  label,  the  sequence  of  test  for 
secondary efficacy endpoint OS will be employed. They will proceed only after the result of the primary 
efficacy  analysis  of  ORR  (based  on  ICR)  is  statistically  significant.  The  tests  will  be  performed  in  the 
following order: ORR (based on ICR) and OS. The sequence of tests will continue until the test does not 
meet the significance level of 2-sided alpha 0.05.

The SAP (Version 1.0, 11 Sep 2019) was finalized prior to database lock (25 Dec 2019). There were no 
changes to the planned analyses. Since some duplicates and one missing protocol deviation record were 
found, the database was unlocked and relocked on 15 Jan 2020 to update only the protocol deviation 
dataset, with no impact on other than the protocol deviation dataset. Since the ADA result of the sample 
collected on 26 Apr 2019 was not reported correctly due to the process error for data selection by the 
vendor, the database was unlocked and relocked on 27 Feb 2020 to update only the ADA dataset, with 
no impact on other than the ADA dataset.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The sought new therapeutic indication of Enhertu for advanced HER2+ GC/GEJC  in the 2L+ setting (after 
a  prior  trastuzumab-based  regimen)  is  based  on  efficacy  data  from  pivotal  study  DESTINY-Gastric02 
(U205) and supportive data from study DESTINY-Gastric01 (J202). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 107/188 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal study DESTINY-Gastric02 (U205) was a Phase 2, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd (6.4 mg/kg as IV infusion Q3W) in subjects with unresectable 
or  metastatic  HER2-positive  gastric  or  GEJ  adenocarcinoma  who  had  progressed  during  or  after  a 
trastuzumab-containing regimen (2L setting). The study was conducted at 24 sites in the US and Europe. 
Supportive data come from study DESTINY-Gastric01 (J202), a  Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, 2:1 
randomized study to evaluate efficacy and safety of T-DXd (6.4 mg/kg as IV infusion Q3W) in subjects 
with advanced HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, who had progressed on 2 or more prior 
regimens (3L setting) that had to include a fluoropyrimidine agent (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or S-1) 
and  a  platinum  agent  (oxaliplatin  or  cisplatin)  in  addition  to  prior  trastuzumab  or  a  trastuzumab 
biosimilar. This primary cohort was compared with a TPC chemotherapy arm (irinotecan or paclitaxel). 
The study was conducted in Asian patients at multiple sites in Japan and South Korea. 
It is acknowledged that there is an unmet medical need for patients with advanced HER2+ GC, who have 
progressed on 1L chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab or a trastuzumab biosimilar. The applied 
indication concerns a HER-2 driven disease and the focus of assessment of the pivotal trial is ORR and 
DOR as indicators of disease activity.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal U205 study enrolled 79 subjects in EU/USA. The subjects were treated with T-DXd at the 
dose of 6.4 mg/kg after progressing on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen (2L setting), which is 
the target population for the sought extension of indication. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed 
ORR by ICR and secondary endpoints were OS, PFS and DoR. All patients provided fresh tumour samples 
for central assessment of HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and evidence of HER2 amplification by ISH) 
as  determined  according  to  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology  –  College  of  American  Pathologists 
guidelines based on this new tumor biopsy obtained after progression on or after a first-line trastuzumab-
containing regimen. Since HER-2 status can change post-trastuzumab, this approach was endorsed. The 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the U205 study clearly define a second line patient population with disease 
progression on or after treatment including trastuzumab and are still in a good condition, i.e. ECOG PS 
0-1.  The  main  limitations  are  related  to  the  single-arm  and  open-label  design  of  the  study,  which 
hampers the assessment, particularly of the time-to-event endpoints. 
In the supportive J202 (DESTINY-Gastric01) study, 188 subjects with progressive disease after two or 
more  lines  (3L+  setting)  were  randomized:  126  to  the  experimental  T-DXd  arm  and  62  to  the 
chemotherapy  arm.  The  study  was  conducted  in  Japan  and  North  Korea.  The  primary  endpoint  was 
unconfirmed ORR by ICR. OS, PFS and DoR were secondary endpoints. The baseline characteristics and 
demographics across both arms of treatment were overall well-balanced. The choice of irinotecan and 
paclitaxel as comparators in the control arm (TPC) are considered appropriate and in line with clinical 
practice in the EU. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal study U205, the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR is 41.8% (DCO 08 Nov 2021). With 
a median duration of follow-up of 5.9 months (range: 0.7 to 15.4) median DOR was 8.1 months (range 
5.9, not estimable). Median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI: 8.6, NE). Median PFS was 5.6 months 
(95% CI: 4.2, 8.3). These results shows that T-DXd offers promising activity in a patient population 
with a high unmet medical need harbouring a highly symptomatic disease. Response rates in the range 
seen in pivotal U205 trial might relate to reduction of symptoms and duration of response.  Overall, T-

DXd would offer a targeted option for these patients. All patients enrolled in the study were high 
expressors of HER-2, as per rebiopsy before enrolment.  
At DCO as of 03 Jun 2020, the supportive study J202 showed a confirmed ORR of 39.7% for the 
primary cohort compared to 11.3% for the TPC group. In the ITT, median DoR was 12.5  months (95% 
CI: 5.6, NE) in the  50 subjects who obtained a response. For the TPC group, median DoR was 3.9 
months (95% CI: 3.0, 4.9). The secondary endpoint of median OS is 12.5 and 8.9 months for the T-
DXd and TPC arms respectively, with a HR=0.59 (95%CI: 0.39, 0.88), which implies a clinically 
relevant median improvement of survival of nearly 4 months.  
It is well known that prognosis of Asian patients with gastric cancer is better than prognosis of non-
Asian patients. This is thought to be related to different factors, including differences in disease 
biology, differences in treatment patterns, and differences in methods for screening/diagnosis. For 
example, in Europe approximately 50% of the patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, 
while this is true for ~20% in Asian patients (likely due to national screening programmes for gastric 
cancer in Asia). Furthermore, there are differences in the initial tumour localisation between regions, 
as GEJ cancer is much more common in non-Asian patients compared with Asian patients. 
As a consequence Asian patients receive more lines of therapy for advanced disease than patients in 
the EU. For example, in Japan almost all patients with metastatic gastric cancer receive second-line 
therapy, and more than half of patients receive three lines of therapy. In Europe, on the other hand, 
only half of the patient population is offered second-line treatment on progression after first-line 
therapy, and only a small proportion of the patients receive third-line therapy. 
Additional expert consultation 
A SAG-O was held on 03-NOV-2022. Minutes from this meeting are presented. 
1)  The  representativeness  of  the  3L  Japanese/Korean  GC/GEJC  population  for  the  2L 
European  population,  given  regional  differences  in  prognosis,  diagnostic  approach  and 
treatment strategy;  
The  SAG  discussed  the  many  differences  between  populations,  especially  between  the  J202  Asian 
population  and  the  target  2nd  line  European  population  in  U205,  such  as  early  diagnostic  approaches 
(screening), surgical procedures and systemic therapies.  However, opinions were split in terms of the 
impact of such differences on expected treatment effects: 
•  According  to  a  majority  view,  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  differences  are  predictive  of  a 
different treatment effect. As such, the observed differences do not have an obvious effect on 
the  possibility  to  generalise  or  extrapolate  results.  Extrapolation  between  3rd  and  2nd  line  of 
chemotherapy  treatment,  for  a  HER2-targeted  agent  did  not  seem  problematic  in  the  target 
indication.  Additionally,  the  prognostic  parameters  and  outcome  in  respect to ORR,  DOR,  PFS 
and  OS  of  the  patients  in  the  J202  3L  trial  are  similar  to  those  of  the  U205  2L  trial.  Thus, 
extrapolation between regions in terms of treatment effects seem acceptable. 
•  According to a minority view, the impact of observed differences is uncertain and generalisation 
and  extrapolation  across  lines  of  treatment  are  difficult,  regardless  of  the  type  of  agent. 
According to this view, extrapolation of treatment effects cannot be justified. 
The SAG agreed that the analyses presented based on external controls are difficult to interpret due to 
possible selection bias, as evidenced by the long event-free period in the treatment group. The SAG also 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 109/188 
 
 
 
recommended that it is important to assess prior treatments by treatment group to ensure relevance of 
the trial populations. 
2) Whether the effect size as observed in the Japanese/Korean 3L patients (J202) and the 
anti-disease  activity  as  shown  in  the  European  patients  included  in  the  U205  study  are 
sufficiently  large  to  overcome  the  uncertainty  (if  any)  related  to  representativeness  as 
considered above. Please elaborate. 
The SAG-O is aware that the patient numbers in both trials are low and that the U205 trial is a single 
arm trial with limitations in respect especially to the magnitude of OS in comparison with other therapies. 
However, according to the majority of experts, looking at the totality of evidence especially the results 
observed in trial J202, including a clear effect on overall survival, the high overall response rate (ORR) 
observed in the single arm trial U205, the likelihood of an improvement in tumour related symptoms, an 
acceptable  toxicity  profile,  and  considering  the  limited  therapeutic  options  with  no  well  established 
treatment  in  this  targeted  population,  justify  that  overall  the  activity  and  efficacy  observed  are 
sufficiently convincing to justify conditional approval even if the confirmatory data from the phase III 
trial in second-line are still outstanding. According to this view, it is important that the confirmatory trial 
should provide clinically and statistically convincing results in terms of true clinical endpoints in the target 
population. Feasibility of such confirmatory trial following early approval should be clearly demonstrated 
and required. 
According to a minority view, the differences among populations are too large to overcome uncertainties, 
particularly taking into account the likely problem with phase III trial feasibility in the target population 
following  early  approval.  Even  if  the  available  exploratory  results  are  promising,  overall  they  do  not 
justify early approval in the target population.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Overall, data on the T-DXd in the intended 2L+ setting for patients with HER2-positive GC/GECJ are 
not deemed comprehensive, but it is likely that the MAH will be able to provide comprehensive data 
through results from the ongoing study DS8201-A-U306 (phase III RCT of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
versus ramucirumab + paclitaxel in the 2L population including EU and USA patients). The Study U306 
will provide interpretable results of time to event endpoints in the 2L setting in a patient population 
representative of the EU population. 
As of 08 Nov 2022, 148 subjects have been enrolled and treated. Planned sample size is ~490 
subjects. Study U306 enrollment is projected to be completed in Dec 2024 and the CSR ready in Q4 of 
2025. The study is conducted in 22 countries from Europe, Latin America and Asia. This requirement 
constitutes a specific obligation (SOB) and is reflected in Annex II of the Opinion

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The single-arm pivotal study U205 in an European population with advanced GC/GEJC showed 
compelling results of T-DXd in terms of ORR and DoR in the 2L setting which is the sought indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022

The main limitations of these data are related to the single-arm design of the study, which hampers 
the assessment, particularly of the time-to-event endpoints. The supportive randomised Phase II study 
J202 in an Asian population showed similar results but was conducted in a different line of treatment.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.1.  Introduction 
The  safety  information  to  support  the  extension  of  indication  comes  from  3  studies.  The  proposed 
recommended dose is 6.4 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (Q3W). 
•  Study  J202  (asian  (Japan+South  Korea)  population,  3L+,  n=125,  DCO  3.6.2020),  phase  II 
randomised  
•  Study U205 (western (US+EU) population, 2L, n=79, DCO 9.4.2021), phase II SAT 
•  Study  J101  (from  this  study  only  asian  GC  patients  treated  with  6.4mg/kg,  n=25,  DCO 
1.8.2019), phase I  
were pooled to form the HER2-positive GC Pool (N = 229) (Table 1.2). 
The pooled safety population has been evaluated for patients who received at least one dose of Enhertu 
6.4 mg/kg (n = 619), across multiple tumour types in clinical studies. 
This dossier only presented safety data for the patients with GC receiving 6.4 mg/kg. Other patients with 
other cancer diseases in other trials have also received 6.4mg/kg, but their safety data was not presented 
in this dossier, and therefore not assessed in this procedure.

Patients in study U205 had slightly worse characteristics compared to patients in the T-DXd arm of 
J202 regarding: tumor burden, proportion of subjects with ECOG PS 1, liver metastases, and ≥2 
metastatic sites. Conversely, other baseline characteristics were worse for subjects in the T-DXd arm 
of J202 than for subjects in U205: age ≥65 years, normal renal function, normal hepatic function, prior 
systemic anticancer therapy (median 3 vs. 1).

a  Subject No. 81182209, who was randomized to the T-DXd arm of J202, became ineligible before first dose, as the subject’s 
ECG results at Cycle 1 Day 1 predose met exclusion criterion 2 (ie, QTcF prolongation to >470 ms [females] or >450 ms 
[males] based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead ECG).  Because the HER2 status by central laboratory was derived 
as the last value before the date of first dose (as per baseline definition in the SAP) and the subject did not have a first dose date, 
his central laboratory HER2 status was entered as “IHC missing” in demographic tables.  However, the subject had a central

2.5.3.1.  Adverse events of special interest 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
After the first suspected fatal ILD case occurred, the Sponsor established an external ILD Adjudication 
Committee (AC). 
The ILD AC adjudicated each potential ILD event with regard to whether it was ILD and whether it 
was related to T-DXd (regardless of the determination made by the investigator) and determined onset 
dates and adjudicated grades for events that the AC considered to be ILD. In June 2019, a global ILD 
awareness campaign was initiated to educate both investigators and subjects with the goal of reducing 
the risk of severe ILD (including fatal cases) by proactively detecting and intensively managing ILD at 
an early stage. 
A total of 27/229 (11.8%) subjects in HER2-positive GC Pool experienced events adjudicated as ILD, 
including 25/229 (10.9%) subjects who experienced events adjudicated as being drug-related ILD. 
Adjudicated drug-related ILD was associated with the outcome of death in 1/79 (1.3%) subject from 
Study U205 and in none of the subjects from the Study J202. 
The  median  time  to  adjudicated  onset  date  of  the  first  drug-related  adjudicated  ILD  event  in  the 
HER2-positive GC Pool was 85 days (range: 36 to 638).

Among the 25/229 subjects in the HER2-positive GC Pool who experienced adjudicated drug-related ILD, 
16/25 (64.0%) received steroids, 9/25 (36.0%) received antibiotics, and 8/25 (32.0%) received both 
steroids and antibiotics.

Left ventricular dysfunction 
Among the 13 relevant PTs included in the case definition of LV dysfunction (Table 2.18), only 1 subject 
in the HER2-positive GC Pool, with grade 3 ejection fraction decrease, met the criteria for LV dysfunction. 
No subjects from Studies J202 and U205 had events of potential LV dysfunction reported. 
Measurements of LVEF from laboratory data (every 2 cycles in Study J101 and every 4 cycles in Study 
J202 and Study U205) were graded as follows per CTCAE Version 4.03 (or Version 5.0), with each LVEF 
measurement being assigned a CTCAE grade: 
•  Grade 2: Resting LVEF 50% to 40%; 10% to 19% decrease from baseline 
•  Grade 3: Resting LVEF 39% to 20%; ≥20% decrease from baseline 
•  Grade 4: Resting LVEF <20%. 
. 
It should be noted that instructions given to the study sites regarding dose modification due to AEs of 
LVEF  decrease  were  different  from  the  CTCAE  grading  above,  as  they  were  based  on  the  following 
guidelines for anti-HER2 therapy  
• 
• 
LVEF of 40% to ≤45% with <10% decrease from baseline required no dose modification. 
LVEF of 40% to ≤45% with ≥10% decrease from baseline and LVEF <40% or >20% decrease 
from baseline required study drug interruption with discontinuation of study drug if the 
value had not improved upon repeat measurement within 3 weeks.

Ethnic differences in toxicity profile 
Ethnic differences in drug toxicity are becoming increasingly recognized and are well documented in 
the scientific literature. In particular, higher hematologic toxicity has been described for Asian vs. 
Western cancer subjects. Although factors underlying such differences have not been precisely 
identified, various intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as variation in PK, genetic, and lifestyle factors 
are considered to be responsible for ethnic specific drug safety profiles.   
While hematologic events were the most common TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs in both studies, the 
following grouped terms were more frequent in the T-DXd arm of Study J202 than in Study U205 
(Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Tables 1.2.2.1 and 1.2.2.2): 
•  Anaemia (PTs: anaemia, haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, red blood cell 
count decreased): 57.6% vs. 34.2%; considered as drug-related, 40.8% vs. 19.0%. 
•  Neutropenia (PTs: neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased): 64.8% vs. 25.3%; 
considered as drug-related, 64.0% vs. 25.3%. 
•  Thrombocytopenia (PTs: thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased): 40.0% vs. 21.5%; 
considered as drug-related, 39.2% vs. 20.3%. 
•  Leukopenia (PTs: leukopenia, white blood cell count decreased): 38.4% vs. 10.1%; 
considered as drug-related, 38.4% vs. 10.1%. 
•  Lymphopenia (PTs: lymphopenia, lymphocyte count decreased): 23.2% vs. 5.1%;  
considered as drug-related, 23.2% vs. 5.1%. 
The higher hematologic toxicity observed in the T-DXd arm of Study J202 (Asian population) vs. Study 
U205 (Western population) is consistent with what has been reported in T-DXd studies in BC, other 
clinical studies of drugs for subjects with advanced GC, and other observations from the literature. The 
Assessment report

exact factors responsible for the more pronounced hematologic toxicity observed in the Japanese and 
Asian population are not known.   
2.5.4.2.  Deaths 
This section summarizes data on all reported deaths, including the following: 
•  On-study deaths, defined as any death that occurred from the date of the first dose up to 
28 days (for Study J101) or up to 47 days (for Studies J202 and U205) after the last dose of 
study drug (as defined in the respective protocols) 
•  Deaths that occurred after the 28-day (for Study J101) or 47-day (for Studies J202 and U205) 
follow-up period

According to the SCS Table 2.8, a total of 10 subjects in Study J202 experienced a fatal TEAE: 8 subjects 
in the T-DXd arm and 2 subjects in the TPC arm.  In the tabular list of narratives in the J202 CSR, there 
were 18 subjects marked with a “Y” in the death column.  Eight of these 18 subjects are not included in 
the SCS Table 2.8 for the following reasons: 
•  Three  subjects  were  from  the  exploratory  cohorts  and  therefore  were  not  included  in  the 
Safety Analysis Set (ie, Subjects No. 81122213 and 81132203 from the exploratory cohort 
1 and Subject No. 81092230 from the exploratory cohort 2).   
•  Five subjects in the TPC cohort died due to disease progression not reported as a TEAE (ie, 
Subjects No. 81112203, 81112218, 81112224, 81292206, and 81352204). 
To  conclude,  there  were  a  total  of  19  subjects  treated  with  T-DXd  who  experienced  fatal  TEAEs,  as 
reported in the HER2-positive GC Pool column of the SCS Table 2.8: 
•  Eight subjects in Study J202 (all on-study deaths). 
•  Ten subjects in Study U205 (8 on-study deaths and 2 off-study deaths). 
•  One subject in Study J101 (on-study death).

In  the  HER2-positive  GC  Pool,  there  were  a  total  of  52  (22.7%)  patients  who  received  a  transfusion 
within 28 days after the onset of a TEAE of anaemia or thrombocytopenia (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Table 
1.2.3.2).  The reasons for the transfusion were as follows (Module 5.3.5.3 SCS Listing 1.8):

Two  subjects  in  Study  J202  experienced  a  ≥Grade  3  event  of  sepsis  within  14  days  of  the  onset  of 
neutropenia (grouped term) or febrile neutropenia. 
A total of 35/229 (15.3%) subjects in the HER2-positive GC Pool were treated with G-CSF within 28 
days after onset of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia, with similar proportion of subjects between the 
T-DXd and the TPC arm of Study J202.

The  MAH  has  reviewed  all  subjects  who  received  G-CSF  during  T-DXd  treatment  and  identified 
38 (16.6%) subjects in the HER2-positive Pool who received G-CSF as either prophylaxis or treatment.  
Subjects who received G-CSF as treatment are presented in Appendix 2 Listing 3. Two of the 38 subjects 
received  G-CSF  as  primary  prophylaxis  for  neutropenia  (Subject No. 81132201  in  Study  J202  and 
Subject  No.  10072002  in  Study  U205).    In  addition,  2 subjects  in  Study  U205  received  G-CSF  as 
secondary prophylaxis for neutropenia (Subject Nos. 44012005 and 39022004). Given the limited use 
of G-CSF as prophylaxis, the MAH considers that the overall incidence of these events is a true reflection 
of  the  toxicity  profile  in  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  Based  on  these  observations,  the  MAH 
considers that neutropenia and febrile neutropenia can be managed by following the guidance on dose 
modification provided in the SmPC and through standard clinical practice.

Liver function test (LFT) 
At enrollment, a total of 57/229 (24.9%) subjects in the HER2-positive GC Pool had mild and 1/229 
(0.4%) had moderate hepatic impairment.  
A total of 130/229 (56.8%) subjects in the HER2-positive GC Pool had liver metastases.  
In  the  HER2-positive  GC  Pool,  8/229  (5.3%)  subjects  had  post-baseline  LFT  values  that  met  the 
biochemical criteria for potential Hy’s Law (ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN and TBL ≥2 × ULN), of which 6/125

(4.8%) subjects were in the Study J202 T-DXd arm and none in Study U205 (Table 3.8). Additionally, 
3/59 (5.1%) in the J202 TPC arm met the biochemical criteria of potential Hy’s Law. 
In all 11 subjects, the events of potential Hy’s Law were determined not to be causally associated 
with study drug due to alternative etiologies at the time of occurrence of the events, the most common 
of which were biliary duct/drainage issues (5 events) and progressive disease (3 events)

None of the 11 cases of potential Hy’s Law were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. In 
all  instances,  at  the  time  of  meeting  potential  Hy’s  Law  biochemical  criteria,  ALP  was  >2  × ULN 
suggesting an obstructive etiology caused the elevated LFT results. The alternative etiology for meeting 
biochemical  Hy’s  Law  criteria  included  the  following:  liver  metastases,  biliary  dilatation  requiring 
stenting,  stent  revision,  or  biliary  drainage,  bile  stone,  cholangitis,  biliary  sepsis,  and  disease 
progression.

2.5.6.1.  Intrinsic factors 
TEAEs were evaluated for the following intrinsic factors: age (<65, ≥65 years and <75, and ≥75 years), 
race (White, Asian, and Other), sex (male, female), ECOG PS (0, 1), renal function at baseline (normal 
function,  mild  impairment,  and  moderate  impairment),  and  hepatic  function  at  baseline  (normal 
function, mild impairment). 
Age 
One notable difference for the category TEAEs with an outcome of death was reported, with a higher 
proportion of subjects in the age group of <65 years. 
In the HER2-positive GC Pool, events in the following categories were reported in a higher proportion of 
subjects ≥75 years of age (n = 24) than in subjects <75 years of age (n = 205): 
TEAEs associated with study drug interruption (14/24 [58.3%] vs. 95/205 [46.3%]) 
•  ≥Grade 3 TEAEs (20/24 [83.3%] vs.147/205 [71.7%]) 
• 
• 
•  SAEs (12/24 [50.0%] vs. 80/205 [39.0%]) 
TEAEs associated with dose reduction (10/24 [41.7%] vs. 58/205 [28.3%]) 
A similar pattern was seen in the TPC arm.

A relatively higher incidence of adjudicated drug-related ILD was seen in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment (14.3%) when compared to subjects with mild renal impairment (9.8%) and subjects with 
normal renal function (11.8%) in the HER2-positive GC Pool. Subjects with moderate renal impairment 
also presented with a higher incidence of ≥Grade 3 adjudicated drug-related ILD when compared to 
subjects with mild renal impairment and normal renal function (3.6% vs. 1.1% vs. 1.5%, respectively).

Country 
Within  the  HER2-positive  GC  Pool,  notable  differences  in  the  frequency  of  events  in  the  following 
categories were observed when comparing subjects from Japan (n = 124) with subjects from countries 
other than Japan (n = 105) (Table 5.5): 
•  ≥Grade 3 TEAEs (overall and drug-related) and TEAEs associated with study drug interruption 
(overall and drug-related) were reported in a higher proportion of subjects from Japan than non-
Japan. 
• 
TEAEs associated with an outcome of death were reported in a proportion at least twice as high 
in subjects from non-Japan countries (12/105 [11.4%]) than from Japan (7/124 [5.6%]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 168/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The higher frequency of TEAEs associated with an outcome of death in Study U205 vs. the T-DXd arm 
of Study J202 (ie, 10 [12.7%] vs. 8 [6.4%]) was mostly attributable to a greater proportion of deaths 
due to COVID-19 (2 [2.5%] vs. 0) and TEAEs related to disease progression (5 [6.3%] vs. 6 [4.8%]).  
Importantly, there were no differences between the 2 studies in terms of drug-related TEAEs associated 
with an outcome of death; indeed, such events were reported only in 1 subject in each study (ILD in 
Study U205 and pneumonia in the T-DXd arm of Study J202).  
The  higher  frequency  of  hematologic  toxicity  in  Asian  vs.  Western  subjects,  and  more  particularly  in 
Japanese  vs.  non-Japanese  subjects,  is  not  surprising  as  it  has  been  already  observed  in  studies  in 
HER2-positive  BC  conducted  by  the  Applicant,  as  well  as  in  published  reports  of  clinical  studies 
investigating  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  HER2-positive  metastatic  GC,  and  other 
observations from the literature. 
2.5.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
2.5.7.1.  Drug-drug interactions 
Although  no  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  studies  have  been  performed  in  subjects  with  GC,  no 
interactions  with  strong  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)3A  and  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptide  1B 
inhibitors were observed in a dedicated DDI study with ritonavir and itraconazole in subjects with HER2-
expressing advanced solid malignant tumors. No new information on drug interactions is available since 
the time of Study DS8201-A-A104 (DCO of 26 Sep 2018). 
2.5.7.2.  Other interactions 
Infusion-related reactions 
T-DXd was not associated with severe infusion-related reactions (IRR).  
In the T-DXd arm of Study J202, 12/125 (9.6%) subjects were antidrug-antibodies (ADA) positive at 
baseline.  No  subjects  were  ADA-positive  at  both  baseline  and  post-baseline.  A  total  of  9/123  (7.3%) 
subjects were identified as having treatment-emergent ADAs. 
In Study U205, a similar proportion of subjects who had a baseline assessment were ADA positive at 
baseline (5/76 (6.6%)). No subjects were ADA-positive at both baseline and post-baseline. A total of 
Assessment report

2/73  (2.7%)  subjects  were  identified  as  having  treatment-emergent  ADAs  (defined  as  having  ADA-
positive samples post-baseline and a negative or missing baseline result).  
After comprehensive review of each potential IRR event in the HER2-positive GC Pool, 2 subjects in the 
T-DXd arm of Study J202 were considered to have experienced IRR events. Both subjects were ADA-
negative at baseline and post-baseline. 
2.5.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the HER2-positive GC Pool, 38/229 (16.6%) subjects experienced any TEAE associated with study 
drug discontinuation, with the most commonly reported TEAE being ILD (15/229 [6.6%]).

A similar proportion of subjects in the Study J202 T-DXd arm (40/125 [32.0%]) and the TPC arm (21/62 
[33.9%]) experienced TEAEs associated with dose reduction except for leukopenia (grouped term), of 
which the incidence was at least twice as high in the TPC arm than in the T-DXd arm (3/62 [4.8%] vs. 
2/125 [1.6%], respectively) (Table 2.11).

[63.2%]) than in Study U205 (17/79 [21.5%]) (Table 2.12).

2.5.9.  Post marketing experience 
Based on review of data from 20 Dec 2019 (first approval of T-DXd in the US) through 01 Aug 2021, no 
new safety findings have been identified from spontaneous reports during the post-marketing period. 
The reported events were generally consistent with the known safety profile of T-DXd. 
2.5.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population consisted of in total 229 adult patients (the HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC Pool): 125 
(J202, 3L+, Asians) + 79 (U205, 2L, Westerns) + 25 (J101, phase I, Asian) with locally advanced or 
metastatic  HER2-positive  gastric  or  GEJ  adenocarcinoma,  who  had  received  a  prior  anti-HER2-based 
regimen.  The  number,  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  these  patients  are  considered 
relevant and the primary safety analysis is based on this pooled dataset. However, supplementary data 
from the confirmatory study DESTINY-Gastric04 (Specific Obligation) are awaited.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 173/188 
 
 
 
 
 
Median duration of treatment was 4.6 months in the T-DXd arm of study J202 and 4.34 months in study 
U205, but somewhat shorter in the TPC arm (2.76 months). In J202 16.8% and in U205 6.3% received 
treatment  more  than  12  months,  whereas  only  2  patients  (3.2%)  in  the  TPC  arm  of  J202  received 
treatment  more  than  9  months.  Median  number  of  cycles  (6  –  6)  and  mean  relative  dose  intensity 
(89.67% – 93.52%) were comparable between the T-DXd arm of J202 and U205 and the exposure to 
T-DXd is considered sufficient to assess the safety profile. 
At the safety data DCOs all (100%) T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg exposed patients had experienced AEs. 72.9% 
had  experienced  ≥grade  3  AEs,  40.2%  SAEs,  16.6%  discontinuation  of  study-drug  due  to  AEs  and 
8.3%  AEs  associated  with  the  outcome  of  death.  96.5%  of  all  T-DXd  6.4  mg/kg  exposed  patients 
experienced  drug-related  AEs,  57.2%  drug-related  ≥grade  3  AEs,  17.9%  drug-related  SAEs,  10.4% 
drug-related  discontinuation  and  0.9%  drug-related  AEs  associated  with  the  outcome  of  death.  The 
majority of AEs and drug-related AEs in J202, U205 and in the HER2+ GC Pool were gastrointestinal or 
hematologic in nature. These are known adverse reactions to topoisomerase inhibitors and are in line 
with what is expected in this patient group in a 2L+ palliative setting from this ADC. The 10 most frequent 
AEs in the HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC pool were: nausea 65.5%, decreased appetite 54.1%, fatigue 52.8%, 
anemia  49.3%,  neutropenia  49.3%,  thrombocytopenia  34.1%,  vomiting  32.3%,  diarrhoea  31.9%, 
leukopenia  28.8%,  constipation  25.8%.  Within  the  2L  Western  population  (U205)  there  was,  in 
comparison to the 3L+ Asian (J202) population, observed lower frequencies of ≥grade 3 AEs (53.2% 
vs 85.6%), of SAEs (36.7% vs 44.8%) and  less dose-reductions (24.1% vs 32.0%) but a higher degree 
of AEs associated with the outcome of death (12.7% va 6.4%). Furthermore, the 2L Western population 
had  lower  levels  of  hematologic  and  higher  levels  of  GI  associated  AEs  compared  to  the  3L+  Asian 
population. The higher incidence of hematologic events in the Asian/Japanese population is consistent 
with the scientific literature in which ethnic differences in drug toxicity are well documented. It has been 
observed in clinical studies in HER2-positive BC patients conducted by the MAH as well as in published 
reports of clinical studies investigating other treatments for HER2-positive metastatic GC. 
ILD, the most important AE of special interest, is a frequent and well-known adverse event (11.8%) 
with almost all cases considered drug-related; ADR (10.9%), by the adjudicated independent committee, 
and strongly associated with T-DXd, as no patients in the TPC arm experienced ILD. The incidence, grade 
and resolution of ILD appears comparable to what is known from the BC population. Mostly grade 1-3, 
a  few  grade  4  and  only  one  grade  5  ILDs  were  observed  leading  to  dose  discontinuation  (in  J202 
predefined discontinuation if grade 2) in 6.6% of patients. The SmPC covers the ILD sufficiently in 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8. LVEF decrease occurred with a low frequency (1.8%), was not fatal and mostly resolved.  
In general, the frequency of SAEs is quite high in both J202 (44.8%), U205 (36.7%) and in the HER2+ 
6.4 mg/kg GC pool (40.2%) and a notable number of patients experienced more than one SAE. The 3L+ 
Asian population has more decreased appetite (10.4% vs 0%), ILD (5.6% vs 2.5%), pneumonia (4% vs 
2.5%),  cholangitis  (2.4%  vs  0%),  anemia3.2%  vs  0%),  dehydration  (3.2%  vs  0%),  tumour 
haemorrhage (2.4% vs 1.3%), jaundice cholestatic (2.4% vs 0%) and pyrexia (2.4% vs 0%). The 2L 
Western population had more nausea (5.1% vs 0.8%), vomiting (3.8% vs 0.8%), abdominal pain (2.5% 
vs 0.8%) and acute kidney injury (2.5% vs 0.8%). This pattern of differences in frequencies of SAEs is 
equivalent to the pattern seen from AEs, which was expected.

In the HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC pool 8.3% experienced AEs associated with the outcome of death, hereof 
2 (0.9%) considered drug-related. This is considered as a concerningly high frequency. The frequency 
was twice as high in the Western 2L compared to the Asian 3L+ (12.7% vs 6.4%) population, as was 
the on-treatment deaths (11.4% vs 6.4%). However, the main reason for deaths (6/10) in study U205 
was disease progression or COVID-19 and as such not drug-related. Deaths due to AEs in the TPC arm 
of J202 was in comparison 3.2%. 
The majority of ADRs were, as expected, gastrointestinal or hematologic in nature. The frequencies of 
all ADRs and grade 3 or 4 ADRs were in general high. The highest occurrence was seen in the T-DXd 
arm of J202A (all 99.2%, grade 3/4 80%), the lowest in U205 (all 97.5%, grade 3/4 39.2%). The TPC 
arm of J202 was in between (all 96.8%, grade 3/4 50%). 
In  the  HER2+  6.4  mg/kg  GC  pool,  there  were  113  (49.3%)  subjects  with  neutropenia  and  9  (3.9%) 
subjects with febrile neutropenia.  
The Asian population (T-DXd arm of J202) had a ~2.5 times as high frequency (12 patients, 9.6%) of 
bleedings compared to the Western population (3 patients, 3.8%). This was anticipated considering the 
higher frequency of thrombocytopenia in the Asian population and is reflected in the SmPC. 
All the patients fulfilling Hy’s law had biochemical liver function tests suggesting an obstructive etiology. 
The  etiologies  for  meeting  biochemical  Hy’s  Law  criteria  included  liver  metastases,  biliary  dilatation 
requiring stenting, stent revision, or biliary drainage, bile stone, cholangitis, biliary sepsis and disease 
progression. Mild hepatic impairment at baseline, primarily in study U205, was associated with a higher 
occurrence of AEs and SAEs, including, drug related AEs and AEs associated with death, compared to 
patients with normal hepatic liver function at baseline.  However, the sample size was small (n=14) and 
5/6 deaths were unrelated to hepatic impairment or study drug. The data do not suggest that T-DXd has 
a different safety profile in subjects with mild hepatic impairment at baselineIn the T-DXd arm of study 
J202 17.6% experienced drug-discontinuation due to  AEs. In U205 this was 15.2% and in the HER2+ 
6.4 mg/kg GC pool 16.6%. These discontinuation rates are rather high, but in the same range as what 
have been seen with 5.4 mg/kg.  
In general, trastuzumab-deruxtecan has a different and more toxic safety profile than standard mono- 
chemotherapy,  as  is  also  seen  with  other  ADCs.  Although  substantial,  the  toxicity  of  T-DXd  was 
manageable.

2.5.11.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In the populations of study J202 and U205, the majority and most common AEs were gastrointestinal or 
hematologic. Hematologic AEs were reported more frequently in the T-DXd arm of J202 than in U205, 
representing the main difference in toxicity profile between the 2 study populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 175/188 
 
 
 
Also,  with  regards  to  grade  ≥3  AEs,  the  hematologic  toxicity  was  far  more  pronounced  in  the  Asian 
population compared to the Western and the primary reason for the notably higher degree of grade ≥3 
AEs in the Asian (J202) population. These results are consistent with the scientific literature in which 
ethnic  differences  in  drug  toxicity  are  well  documented,  and  with  the  observations  from  the  clinical 
studies in HER2 positive BC patients conducted by the MAH, as well as published reports of clinical studies 
of other treatments for HER2-positive metastatic GC. 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  relatively  high.  The  difference  in  occurence  between  the  two  studies  was 
primarily  due  to  higher  frequency  of  decreased  appetite  and  ILD  in  the  Asian  (J202)  population.  The 
discontinuation rate was relatively high but similar in the two studies and within the range of what is 
observed  with  targeted  ADCs.  AEs  associated  with  an  outcome  of  death  were  twice  as  high  in  U205 
compared  to  the  T-DXd  arm  of  J202  but  the  majority  of  deaths  were  due  to  disease  progression  or 
COVID-19 and the difference is therefore acceptable. The frequency of ILD, an important identified risk 
factor associated with T-DXd treatment, was higher in the T-DXd arm of J202 than in U205. However, 
in both populations, the majority of drug-related ILD events were low grade, and the risk of and actions 
taken in case of ILD is sufficiently described in the SmPC.  
In  conclusion,  the  toxicity  was  manageable  within  both  patient  populations  (T-DXd  arm  of  J202  and 
U205)  although  with  differences  in  the  toxicity  profile  between  the  two  groups.  The  differences  were 
primarily due to expected higher hematologic toxicity in the Asian (mainly Japanese) population and due 
to the differences in baseline disease characteristics. Some differences were not obviously explainable. 
The toxicity profile of T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg is considered thoroughly described for both studies and was not 
worse  or  better  for  either  group,  but  with  somewhat  different  profiles.  The  median  T-DXd  treatment 
duration  and  median  relative  dose  intensity  were  consistent  in  the  T-DXd  arm  of  J202  and  U205, 
supporting that T-DXd was equally tolerated in the two study populations. Overall and across ethnicities 
and line of treatment, the toxicity profile of T-DXd is found to be challenging but considered manageable 
within the patient group encompassed by the sought and approved indication statement.  
The  important  issues  stated  in  the  RMP  will  be  addressed  and  the  safety  profile  of  Enhertu  in  the 
treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2+ GC will be confirmed in the ongoing confirmatory study 
DESTINY-Gastric 04 (DS-8201-A-U306) of which results are required as a special obligation for the CMA 
of the current extension of indication.

Characteristics 
2.7.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of the MA are acceptable. 
2.8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.6 of the SmPC are being updated 
to reflect the new applied indication and corresponding changes to relevant sections. The Package Leaflet 
(PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
A full user test of the PL was done during the review of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application 
(MAA) for Enhertu in 2020. Enhertu is prescribed by a physician and administered intravenously under 
the supervision of a healthcare professional at a hospital/clinical setting. The posology for the applied 
indication is new however the mode of administration and method of reconstitution is unchanged. The 
updated PIL will be kept in an identical format size, colours and layout/design. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH for Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) has submitted a type II variation for an extension of 
indication. The final approved indication is:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 180/188 
 
 
 
 
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2 positive 
gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- 
based regimen. 
Patients treated with Enhertu for gastric or GEJ cancer should have documented HER2-positive tumour 
status, defined as a score of 3 + by IHC or a ratio of ≥ 2 by ISH or by FISH, assessed by a CE marked 
IVD medical device. If a CE marked IVD is not available, the HER2 status should be assessed by an 
alternate validated test. 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 6.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Usually stomach (gastric) cancer (GC) starts in the lining of the stomach, growing slowly over the course 
of  several  years  and  causing  few  if  any  symptoms.  Most  patients  (up  to  95  percent)  develop 
adenocarcinoma and are typically classified based on anatomic location (cardia/proximal, arising in the 
region adjoining the GEJ, or non-cardia/distal, arising in the lower portion of the stomach) and histologic 
type (diffuse, with undifferentiated tumour cells, or intestinal, with well-differentiated tumour cells).  11, 
12 Overexpression  or  amplification  of  the  HER2  gene  or  protein  is  reported  in  approximately  20%  of 
patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, with higher rates of HER2 positivity seen in patients with intestinal 
histology than those with diffuse histology. Most patients present with inoperable advanced or metastatic 
disease requiring palliative treatment, although early detection is more common in Asia than in other 
regions. 5-year survival for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is around 5–20%, with median overall 
survival being less than 1 year. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Locally  advanced  or  metastatic  HER2-positive  gastric  adenocarcinoma  remains  an  incurable  disease. 
Once patients have progressed after a first-line regimen that includes anti-HER2 therapy, the disease 
outcomes are poor. 13Ramucirumab (antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody) in combination with paclitaxel 
is  approved  for  second  line  GC/GEJC  regardless  of  HER2  expression.  Other  treatment  options  in  the 
second-line  or  subsequent  therapy  settings  include  docetaxel,  irinotecan  and  FOLFIRI  (folinic  acid, 
fluorouracil, and irinotecan). Currently, there is no approved targeted anti-HER2 therapy in the EU for 
the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma in the second line or beyond settings, 
constituting a clear unmet need.                                                                                                                                                     
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study DESTINY-Gastric02 (U205) was a Phase 2, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd (6.4 mg/kg as IV infusion Q3W) in 79 subjects with 
unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed during or 
after a trastuzumab-containing regimen (2L+ setting). The study was conducted in a Western

population at 24 sites in the US and Europe. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR by ICR, 
while duration of response was a secondary endpoint. 
The supportive study DESTINY-Gastric01 (J202) was a Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, 2:1 randomized 
study  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  in  subjects  with  advanced  HER2-positive  gastric  or  GEJ 
adenocarcinoma  who had progressed  on  2  or  more  prior  regimens  including  a  fluoropyrimidine  agent 
(fluorouracil,  capecitabine,  or  S-1)  and  a  platinum  agent  (oxaliplatin  or  cisplatin)  in  addition  to  prior 
trastuzumab or a trastuzumab biosimilar (3L+ setting). The study was conducted in Japan and South 
Korea. Of focus in this assessment is the Primary Cohort (N=188), in which subjects were randomized 
to receive either T-DXd monotherapy at the proposed dose (6.4 mg/kg Q3W, n=126) or treatment of 
physician’s choice (irinotecan or paclitaxel, n=62). The primary efficacy endpoint was unconfirmed ORR 
by ICR and the secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, mDoR and ORR by ICR. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal U205 study in 2L US/European patients: 
At initial DCO 09-APR-2021, confirmed ORR in this supportive SAT was 38.0% and mDoR was 8.1 
months. At an updated DCO on 08-NOV-2021, confirmed ORR increased slightly to 41.8%. In this 
updated data, mDOR remained at 8.1 months. 
Supportive J202 study in 3L Asian patients: 
At  DCO  08-NOV-2019,  pivotal  study  J202  met  its  primary  endpoint  of  improved  response  rate  in  the 
experimental  arm:  unconfirmed  ORR  by  ICR  was  48.4%  in  the  T-DXd  arm  vs.  12.9%  in  the  control 
irinotecan or paclitaxel arm. Confirmed response in the T-DXd arm was 38.0%. At DCO 03-JUN-2020, 
updated confirmed ORR by ICR remained stable at 39.7%.  
In  the  last  DCO,  median  DOR  was  12.5  months  in  the  T-DXd  arm  vs.  3.9  months  in  the  control 
chemotherapy  arm.  Time-to-event  endpoints  also  showed  an  advantage  of  T-DXd:  mOS  12.5  vs.  8.9 
months and mPFS 5.6 vs 3.5 months. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the absence of a control arm in the U205 study any conclusion based on indirect comparison lacks 
validity, as it cannot be readily assumed that the study populations are sufficiently similar to use the 
external comparison in support for extrapolation between lines of treatment. Despite compelling data 
from this single-arm trial, comprehensive data on the product are not available and as it is likely that 
the applicant will be able to provide these data, the on-going study DS8201-A-U306 (phase III RCT of 
trastuzumab  deruxtecan  versus  ramucirumab  +  paclitaxel  in  the  2L  population  including  EU  and  USA 
patients) constitutes a SOB in Annex II of the Opinion. 
Due to better prognosis, Asian patients are treated with more lines of therapy for advanced disease than 
patients in the West. Therefore, comparison of results across the 3L+ Asian and  the Western 2L+ setting 
is not straightforward because of intrinsic/extrinsic differences.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
At safety data DCOs (J202: 03-JUN-2020, U205: 09-APR-2021, J101: 01-AUG-2019) 73% of patients 
had experienced ≥grade 3 AEs, 40% SAEs, 17% discontinuation of study-drug due to AEs and 8% AEs 
associated with the outcome of death. The frequency of the same events in the physician’s choice arm 
(mainly irinotecan, a few paclitaxel) of study J202 were all lower. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 182/188 
 
 
 
The  10  most  frequent  AEs  in  the  HER2+  6.4  mg/kg  GC  pool  were:  nausea  66%,  decreased  appetite 
54%, fatigue 53%, anaemia 49%, neutropenia 49%, thrombocytopenia 34%, vomiting 32%, diarrhoea 
32%, leukopenia 29%, and constipation 26%. 
Within the 2L Western population (U205) there were, in comparison to the 3L+ Asian (J202) population, 
lower  frequencies  of  ≥grade  3  AEs  (53%  vs  86%)  and  SAEs  (37%  vs  45%).  The  same  frequency  of 
dose-discontinuations  was  seen  between  the  two  populations.  The  hematologic  toxicity  was  far  more 
pronounced in the Asian population compared to the Western one, and the primary reason for the notably 
higher degree of grade ≥3 AEs in the Asian (J202) population. This ethnic difference in toxicity is well 
known  and  described  across  Oncology  trials.  The  frequency  of  SAEs  was  relatively  high;  40%,  in  the 
HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC pool (45% in J202 and 37% in U205). The difference between the two studies was 
primarily  due  to  a  higher  frequency  of  decreased  appetite  and  ILD  in  the  Asian  (J202)  population. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  acknowledged  that  hospitalisations  in  patients  with  GC/GEJC  are  quite  frequent  in 
view of clinical fragility and disease-associated factors. 
The pattern of differences in frequencies of SAEs was equivalent to the pattern seen in AEs. In the T-
DXd arm of study J202, 17.6% experienced drug-discontinuation due to an AE. In U205 this was 15.2% 
and in the HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC pool 16.6%. These discontinuation rates are rather high. ILD as reason 
for  discontinuation  occurred  equally  frequent  in  the  two  T-DXd  exposed  study  populations  (6.4%  vs 
6.3%) and was the primary cause of drug-discontinuation in both studies. The majority of drug-related 
ILD events were low grade (grade 1 or 2 in 13/16 subjects in the T-DXd arm of J202 and 5/6 subjects 
in U205), although a few fatal cases were observed. 
In the HER2+ 6.4 mg/kg GC pool, 19/229 patients (8.3%), hereof 2 (0.9%) considered drug-related, 
experienced  AEs  associated  with  the  outcome  of  death.  The  frequency  of  AEs  associated  with  the 
outcome of death was twice as high in the Western 2L population compared to the Asian 3L+ (12.7% vs 
6.4%), as was the on-treatment deaths (11.4% vs 6.4%), However, 6/10 deaths in U205 were due to 
disease progression or COVID-19 and the difference therefore acceptable. AEs with outcome of death in 
the physician choice arm of J202 occurred in 3.2%.  
In the small group of patients ≥75 years of age from the TXD-d pool (24/229) compared to patients <75 
years  of  age  (n=204),  there  was  a  higher  frequency  of  ≥grade  3  TEAEs  (83.3  vs  71.7%),  TEAEs 
associated with drug interruptions (58.3 vs 46.3%), dose reductions (41.7 vs 28.3%) and SAEs (50.0 
vs 39%).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The toxicity profiles of patients in study J202 T-DXd arm and study U205 are divergent with regard to 
the intrinsic factors age, sex, renal and hepatic function at baseline and with regards to the extrinsic 
factors concerning region and country. The frequencies of ≥grade 3 AEs, SAEs and AEs associated with 
death are also divergent, but to a large degree explainable. Differences in baseline disease characteristics 
and the well-established higher degree of hematologic toxicity in the Asian population, are some of the 
major reasons for the differences, but also the difference in study design, with one being a RCT (J202) 
and the other (U205) being a SAT, challenges the direct comparability of the safety profiles. Pooling data 
when the frequencies in quite a number of toxicity events are very far apart between the two populations 
is, to some degree, obscuring the data and the understandings that lead from them.  
The safety evaluation in the HER2-positive GC pool is mainly based on data from the Asian population 
(n=150) with a smaller proportion of Western patients (n=79). Exposure-safety analyses indicated race-
country as a covariate for most safety parameters indicating that the safety profile in study J202 cannot

easily be extrapolated to Western patients. In addition, the possibilities for extrapolation may be further 
impacted by the fact that the Asian patients included in study J202 were more heavily pre-treated than 
the European and US patients in studies U205, while having a better performance score. 
The toxicity was manageable within both patient populations (T-DXd arm of J202 and U205) although 
with differences in the toxicity profile between the two groups. The differences were primarily due to 
expected  higher  hematologic  toxicity  in  the  Asian  (mainly  Japanese)  population  and  due  to  the 
differences  in  baseline  disease  characteristics.  Some  differences  were  not  obviously  explainable.  The 
toxicity profile of T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg is considered thoroughly displayed for both studies and could not be 
described as worse or better for either group, but as with different profiles.  
The described uncertainties regarding the safety profile of T-DXd in the treatment of patients with GC 
will be further clarified by the fulfillment of the RMP. Additionally, a confirmation of the safety profile will 
be provided with the outcome of the ongoing confirmatory trial DESTINY-Gastric 04 required as a specific 
obligation. This is needed to guarantee comprehensiveness of the safety (and efficacy) data and by that 
to ensure a fully established safety profile.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Locally  advanced  or  metastatic  HER2-positive  gastric  and  gastroesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma 
remain an incurable disease. Once patients have progressed after a first-line regimen that includes an 
anti-HER2  therapy,  disease  outcomes  are  poor.  Currently,  there  is  no  approved  targeted  anti-HER2 
therapy in the EU for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma in the second-
line setting and beyond, which constitutes an unmet medical need.  
Disease  activity  from  T-DXd  is  evident  from  results  in  the  pivotal  trial  and  this  preliminary  promising 
efficacy is supported by the 3L+ Asian J202 trial, but it is not yet considered that comprehensive data 
for the intended 2L+ setting has been presented. To address this, the MAH has commited to providing 
results from the ongoing DESTINY-Gastric04 trial, currently imposed as a SOB in Annex II.  
The  majority  of  AEs  and  ADRs  in  J202,  U205  and  in  the  HER2+  GC  Pool  were  gastrointestinal  or 
hematologic in nature. Hematologic AEs were reported more frequently in the T-DXd arm of J202 than 
in U205, representing the main difference in toxicity profile between the 2 study populations.There were 
notable differences in the toxicity profile between the two patient groups. These were primarily due to 
expected  higher  hematologic  toxicity  in  the  Asian  (mainly  Japanese)  population  and  due  to  the 
differences in baseline disease characteristics. The differences in baseline disease characteristics, ethnic 
differencies  in  toxicity  profile  and  differences  in  study  design  challenges  the comparability  of  the  two

study populations’ safety profiles. Pooling data when the frequencies in quite a number of toxicity events 
are  very  far  apart  between  the  two  populations  is,  to  some  degree,  obscuring  the  data  and  the 
understandings  led  from  them.  Still,  the  toxicity  profile  of  T-DXd  6.4  mg/kg  is  considered thoroughly 
displayed  for  both  studies  and  regarded  as  manageable  within  both  patient  populations.  However, 
comprehensive data are awaited with the ongoing confirmatory phase 3 study DESTINY-Gastric 04 (DS-
8201-A-U306).  
However,  the  investigated  patient  group  has  metastatic  gastric  cancer,  often  symptomatic  (and  also 
leading to frequent hospitalisations) and many patients were heavily pre-treated. The targeted patient 
population  are  to  an  extent  fragile  and  if  left  untreated,  they  have  a  very  limited  remaining  life 
expectancy. Therefore, toxicity and treatment-related deaths can be considered acceptable in view of 
the potential efficacy benefits. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R of Enhertu for the intended 2L HER2+ GC/GEJC setting is positive in the context of a 
conditional approval.    
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A  SAG-O  consultation  concerning  the  remaining  uncertainties  of  Enhertu  for  the  proposed  2L  HER2+ 
GC/GEJC was held on 03-NOV-2022. The SAG-O concluded that the activity and efficacy from T-DXd in 
the targeted population are sufficiently convincing to justify conditional approval even if the confirmatory 
data from the phase III trial in second-line are still outstanding. It was emphasised that the feasibility 
of the trial is the pillar for the considerations of the SAG-O. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Enhertu  was  initially,  and  currently  is,  approved  as  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  (CMA).  As 
comprehensive data on the product for this extension of indication are also not available, a conditional 
marketing authorisation was requested for this extension of indication. 
Importantly,  this  extension  of  indication  falls  within  the  scope  of  Article  14-a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004  concerning  conditional  marketing  authorisations,  as  it  aims  at  the  treatment  of  a  seriously 
debilitating, life- threatening disease. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the new indication for this 
product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: 
• The benefit-risk balance of T-DXd is positive, as the results from studies U205 (pivotal study) and J202 
(supportive study) are of clinical relevance in the applied indication, with confirmed objective response 
rates (ORR) by blinded independent central review of 41.8% in Study U205 and 39.7% in Study J202, 
both  studies  showed  clinically  meaningful  median  duration  of  response  (DoR)  (8.1  and  12.5  months, 
respectively).  
• It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The DESTINY-Gastric04 study is a Phase 3, multicenter, 2-arm, randomized, open-label study of T-DXd 
6.4 mg/kg in subjects with HER2-positive metastatic and/or unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen. The primary objective will assess 
OS and the secondary objectives will further assess efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of T-DXd 
compared  with  Ramucirumab  +  paclitaxel.  As  of  08  Nov  2022,  148  subjects  have  been  enrolled  and 
treated.  Albeit  recruitment  might  be  impacted  by  approval  in  the  EU,  the  MAH  has  substantiated  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/931431/2022  
Page 186/188 
 
 
 
 
feasibility of this study and as of 08 Nov 2022, 148 subjects have been enrolled and treated. There is 
planned ~490 subjects to be enrolled. Study U306 enrollment is projected to be completed by Dec 2024 
and the CSR ready in Q4 of 2025. The study is currently being conducted in the following 22 countries: 
Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, 
Japan, South Korea, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and United Kingdom. 
• T-DXd fulfils an unmet medical need as currently, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
HER2-positive GC, there is no approved HER2-targeted therapy after progression on chemotherapy 
with fluoropyrimidine + platinum agents plus trastuzumab (the standard of care in the first-line [1L] 
setting). The ORRs from currently approved treatments in 2L (PTX, docetaxel, irinotecan monotherapy,  
FOLFIRI [folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan] or ramucirumab + PTX or PTX-only) after a 1L 
regimen that includes an anti-HER2 therapy range from 3% to 28%. Median PFS ranges from 
approximately 1 month to 4 months and median OS ranges from approximately 4 months to 10 
months in the 2L setting. While the limitations related to indirect comparisons between studies are 
acknowledged, T-DXd will act through a different mechanism of action, and is expected to bring a 
major therapeutic advantage to patients.  
• The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. Once the patient’s GC has progressed on or after a 1L regimen that 
includes an anti-HER2 therapy, the disease outcomes are poor, with the 5-year survival rates ranging 
from  10%  to  approximately  30%.  For  those  patients  whose  initial  diagnosis  is  Stage  IV  disease,  the 
prognosis is dismal in Asian and Western regions. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of trastuzumab-deruxtecan for the intended second line treatment of GC/GEJC is 
positive subject to the specific obligations and conditions imposed in order to obtain further clinical 
data to generate a comprehensive clinical data set. Consequently, the ongoing study DESTINY-
Gastric04 (DS8201-A-U306) trial, a phase III RCT of trastuzumab deruxtecan versus ramucirumab + 
paclitaxel in the 2L population including EU and USA patients is imposed as a SOB in Annex II of the 
Opinion.

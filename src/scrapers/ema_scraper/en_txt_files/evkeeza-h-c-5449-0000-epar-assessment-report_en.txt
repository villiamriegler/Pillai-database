2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for evinacumab (Evkeeza).  
Evinacumab is proposed for use as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older 
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic life-threatening condition resulting 
in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) leading to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, in 
untreated patients, premature death. The goal of therapy in patients with HoFH is to reduce LDL-C, 
thereby reducing atherogenesis and subsequently reducing CVD events and mortality. Currently, 
patients with HoFH tend to be treated with multiple lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) but are not able to 
achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C targets. 
HoFH is a rare genetic disorder of lipid metabolism and is most often caused by the presence of loss-
of-function variants in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which leads to low or absent hepatic 
clearance of LDL cholesterol from the circulation. Genetic alterations that cause a virtually complete 
absence of LDL-receptor expression (null homozygotes) result in higher LDL cholesterol levels than 
alterations that partially reduce LDL-receptor activity with either two non-null alleles or one null and 
one non-null allele (nonnull homozygotes). 
Mutations in LDLR are classified into the following subtypes:  
1. 
2. 
“Null/null” where little to no LDL binding and uptake activity exists (<15% LDLR activity)  
Genotypically “negative/negative” where mutations in stop codons, frame shifts, splice site 
changes, small and large insertions/deletions, and copy number variations (CNVs) result in the loss of 
function of both LDLR alleles  
3. 
Genotypically "defective" where missense mutations (hypomorphs) result in diminished LDLR 
activity (>15% LDLR activity). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The proposed target population for evinacumab is patients with HoFH (homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia). HoFH is a rare (~1 in 300,000 in the EU) and life-threatening genetic 
condition resulting in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) from birth and premature cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). If left untreated, HoFH patients rarely live past the first or second decade of life. 
Moreover, even with the currently available lipid-lowering therapies, many patients still do not reach 
their target LDL-C goal and consequently are still at high risk for a CVD event. In a recent 
retrospective study in Italian patients with HoFH, 22% of the patients had a CVD event before age 20, 
and 16.7% died before age 21, despite starting lipid-lowering treatments early (Stefanutti 2019).

EMA/250315/2021  
Page 11/123 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Regardless of the underlying mutations, this disorder is characterised by a markedly elevated plasma 
LDL cholesterol level from birth, which results in an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. In children as young as 7 years of age, coronary atherosclerosis can be evident 
even without any clinically apparent coronary artery disease (CAD). For example, one study showed 
increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and cIMT progression at a rate approximately double 
that of unaffected siblings (Kusters, 2014). This accelerated atherosclerosis results in premature 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. 
Moreover, patients with mutations considered null/null or negative/negative have higher LDL-C levels 
and worse clinical outcomes. These patients develop xanthomas sooner, and untreated patients rarely 
live past the second decade (Moorjani, 1993) (Kolansky, 2008). 
Regardless of the underlying mutations, this disorder is characterised by a markedly elevated plasma

Moreover, patients with mutations considered null/null or negative/negative have higher LDL-C levels 
and worse clinical outcomes. These patients develop xanthomas sooner, and untreated patients rarely 
live past the second decade (Moorjani, 1993) (Kolansky, 2008). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Because of the rarity of the condition (approximately 1 in 300,000), there is a paucity of data on CV 
risk in patients with HoFH; however, one study found significant CV morbidity early in life with 
evidence of ASCVD well before the age of 20 (Sjouke 2015). If left untreated, HoFH patients rarely live 
past the first or second decade of life, with one study indicating the mean age of the first event at 12.8 
years and an average age of ASCVD death of 17.7 years (Raal 2011). Further, a recent retrospective 
study in Italian and Chinese patients with HoFH showed that despite starting lipid-lowering treatments 
early (mean age of 5.6 year, Italian cohort, and 10.7 year, Chinese cohort), 22% (Italian cohort) and 
45% (Chinese cohort) of the patients had a CVD event before age 20 and 16.7% (Italian cohort) and 
31.8% (Chinese cohort) had died before age 21 (Stefanutti 2019). Additionally, another retrospective 
analysis showed that on-treatment total cholesterol is a major determinant of survival in patients with 
HoFH, with higher total cholesterol levels associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (11.5 times greater in quartile 4 [>15.1 mmol/L] compared to quartile 1 [<8.1 mmol/L]) 
(Thompson 2018). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Attempts to lower cholesterol levels often require multiple lipid-lowering drugs and LDL apheresis. 
Despite these therapies, a majority of patients with this disorder do not reach guideline-recommended 
LDL cholesterol levels. Patients with HoFH are often treated with multiple lipid-lowering treatments 
(LLTs) including statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, ezetimibe, 
lomitapide, and lipid apheresis; however, these treatments are largely ineffective for patients either 
due to LDLR mutations, problems with tolerability, and/or they are not available for the pediatric 
population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 12/123 
 
 
 
Statin therapy is the cornerstone treatment for LDL-C lowering and causes a 15-30% reduction in LDL-
C in patients with HoFH. When ezetimibe is added to a statin, LDL-C reduces by 20%-27% compared 
to statin alone in patients with HoFH; nevertheless, it is acknowledged that HoFH patients treated with 
a high dose statin and ezetimibe likely remain far from their LDL-C goal.  
Other lipid-lowering therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors could be used as well. Anti-PCSK9 therapy on 
top of maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy resulted in a mean reduction in LDL-C of 
approximately 30% compared to placebo. Of note, only evolocumab is currently approved for patients 
with HoFH; use of alirocumab in patients with HoFH is considered off label.  
Another available drug for HoFH is lomitapide, a selective inhibitor of microsomal transfer protein 
(MTP). Lomitapide causes reductions in LDL-C of 40%; however, optimal lomitapide treatment is 
limited by tolerability issues of gastrointestinal adverse events. Also, long-term safety, including, e.g. 
effects on the liver, is still uncertain.  
Despite intensive drug therapy, most of the patients with HoFH cannot achieve their treatment LDL-C 
goal. Therefore, apheresis is an important adjunctive treatment for HoFH; a single treatment reduces 
LDL-C by 55%-70% relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome, and its 
availability is limited. Also, only a temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Liver transplantation can be used to treat HoFH, although it is rarely used and considered as a last 
resort treatment option due to the many disadvantages, including a high risk of post-transplantation 
surgical complications and mortality, the paucity of donors, and the need for life-long treatment with 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
Due to the limitations of currently available treatments, there exists a high unmet medical need for 
new therapeutic options that reduce LDL-C and the inevitable risk for premature ASCVD in patients 
with HoFH. The unmet medical need is particularly severe for HoFH patients with null/null or 
negative/negative mutations where currently available LLTs provide little benefit in lowering LDL-C and 
for pediatric HoFH patients who lack treatment options. 
About the product 
Evinacumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like 3 
(ANGPTL3), which leads to reductions in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and TGs. 
This gives a similar lipid phenotype that is found in humans with ANGPTL3 loss of function (LOF). This 
phenotype is associated with hypolipidemia and protection against atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease.  
Evinacumab is a new class of drug with a novel mechanism of action. Evinacumab reduces LDL-C 
independent of the presence of LDL receptor (LDLR) by promoting very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 
processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation; however, the exact mechanism of increased 
VLDL processing and clearance is not exactly known. Evinacumab blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TGs and 
HDL-C by rescuing lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase activities, respectively. 
Evinacumab is proposed for use as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older 
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
Evinacumab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Evkeeza is a 150 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The recommended dose is 15 mg/kg 
administered by intravenous infusion (IV) over 60 minutes once monthly (Q4W).

considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following conclusions. 
“It was acknowledged that evinacumab is a medicinal product of major public health interest since the 
unmet medical need for additional lipid-lowering therapy in patients with HoFH might be fulfilled with 
evinacumab. It has sufficiently been made clear that here are currently available therapies do not 
satisfactory treatments reduce LDL-C levels (and consequently CV risk) for these patients, especially 
for those with null/null or negative/negative mutations for which LDLR dependent therapies show no to 
minimal benefit. 
Evinacumab has a new mechanism of action, which is independent of the presence of LDLR. 
Evinacumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL3, which plays a role in the 
regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). 
Evinacumab leads to a reduction in LDL-C independent of the presence of an LDLR by promoting very 
low-density (VLDL) processing and clearance, thereby reducing the VLDL pool available to generate 
LDL-C, although the exact mechanism of the increased processing and clearance of VLDL remains 
undefined. Considering that 90% of the patients with HoFH have mutations in the LDLR gene in which 
LDLR dependent lipid-lowering therapies have no or minimal effect, this new LDLR independent 
pathway provides a new therapeutic innovation in the management of persistent elevated LDL-C in 
patients with HoFH. The MAA relies on the results of the pivotal placebo-controlled double-blind phase 
3 study that consists of a 24-week double-blind treatment period and a 24-week open-label treatment 
period to evaluate treatment of evinacumab in 65 patients with HoFH. The design of the study appears 
appropriate to establish the LDL-C lowering effect of evinacumab in patients with HoFH. The sample 
size of 65 patients, of which 43 patients are treated with evinacumab can be considered limited, 
however, could be acceptable based on the rarity of the disease. Further, the 24 weeks double-blind 
placebo-control treatment period could be acceptable in this particular population of high unmet need. 
Single-arm open-label safety data have been evaluated for an additional 24 weeks, which may be 
regarded as limited but follows SAWP advice and general ICH requirements. Longer-term safety data 
will be generated during MAA, with an ongoing phase 3 single-arm open-label extension study. 
In this pivotal phase 3 study, evinacumab seems to further reduce LDL-C levels by ~50% beyond that 
what can be achieved with current therapy, including apheresis. This substantial reduction in LDL-C 
was achieved regardless of the type of genetic mutations and background lipid-lowering therapy. The 
primary endpoint of LDL-C is a valid surrogate for cardiovascular risk reduction in line with the EMA 
guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/338966/2016). Due to the rarity of the disease, any long term CV outcome study seems not 
feasible, and one has to rely on surrogate parameters as LDL-C to provide some estimation of the 
possible effects. In line with previously approved therapies for HoFH, such an approach would be 
justified considering the very high cardiovascular risk for whom in these patients in line with previously 
approved therapies for HoFH and considering population seems not feasible because of the limited 
number of patients. A positive clinical outcome in HoFH patients by LDL-C lowering is supported by two 
retrospective studies showed that lipid-lowering therapy is associated with reduced risk for CV 
morbidity and mortality in patients with HoFH (Raal, 2011 and Thompson,2018). Moreover, large 
population-based studies revealed individuals with loss of function (LOF) mutations in ANGPTL3 have a 
lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with non-carriers (Dewey, 2017), although this 
effect was marginal. Efficacy in LDL-C was supported by significant improvements in other parameters 
of the cholesterol profile, i.e. TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C. However, treatment with evinacumab also resulted 
in a 30% reduction in HDL-C at week 24 of which the impact on reverse cholesterol transport and 
atherosclerosis and subsequently risk for CVD events is uncertain. Despite this consideration, the LDL-
Assessment report

C treatment effect with evinacumab as based on the presented data is substantial and could likely 
outweigh the observed effect on HDL-C, although this may be subject for discussion during the MAA. 
Overall, evinacumab is considered a medicinal product of major public health interest as it addresses a 
substantial unmet medical need and provides a therapeutic innovation for the management of LDL-C in 
patients with HoFH with the expectation of reduction of the very high cardiovascular risk. Further, the 
available efficacy and safety database seems limited but generally sufficient for the evaluation of the 
benefit/risk of evinacumab in the proposed indication, although some uncertainties have been 
identified, which includes the undefined mechanism of action, the lack of long term efficacy and safety 
data, a possible treatment-related serious event of anaphylaxis and the observed substantial reduction 
in HDL-C in HoFH patients treated with evinacumab. Nevertheless, it is not considered that these 
issues should withhold the current request, especially if these issues can appropriately be addressed 
during MAA.” 
However, during the assessment of this application the CHMP concluded that it was no longer 
appropriate to pursue accelerated assessment, as major objections have been identified that could not 
be handled in an accelerated timetable.  
The applicant did not request consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above mentioned Regulation. 
However, as comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances was proposed by the CHMP after having consulted the applicant because the 
applied for indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to 
provide comprehensive evidence.

Scientific advice  
On 7 March 2017, the Applicant had a Scientific Advice meeting with the Scientific Advice Working 
Party (SAWP) of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) to discuss the Phase 3 HoFH 
study (R1500-CL-1629) and the overall development plan intended to support a marketing application. 
The CHMP adopted the advice proposed by the SAWP. A summary of the main points from the CHMP 
scientific advice is displayed below: 
•  The CHMP agreed that the completed chronic general toxicity and embryo-fetal development 
toxicity were acceptable for the MAA. However, they stated that considering the relative absence 
of toxicity in the chronic studies, the need for juvenile toxicity studies is not immediately 
apparent, and the CHMP does not recommend initiating juvenile toxicology studies unless the 
Applicant can justify otherwise. 
•  The CHMP agreed the following studies were not required to support registration: 
o  drug-drug interaction studies 
o 
o 
thorough QT study 
renal or hepatic impairment studies 
•  The CHMP stated that the planned phase 3 HoFH study (R1500-CL-1629), could potentially 
support a marketing application in adults and adolescents with HoFH. Specifically, they did not

object to the duration of the controlled study, the patient population, including adolescents, 
sample size, the primary endpoint and statistical analysis approach, and the dose selection. 
•  The CHMP agreed with the proposed safety database planned in the marketing application. 
Paediatric Investigation Plan 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan has been agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). 
Indication targeted by the PIP: Evinacumab is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C lowering 
therapies for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), 
including patients with double null/negative LDL-R mutations. 
The subset of the paediatric population concerned by the paediatric development ranges from 5 years 
to less than 18 years of age.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Evinacumab (INN) is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody containing a serine-to-proline 
substitution within the hinge region of the Fc domain.  
Evinacumab is a covalent heterotetramer consisting of two disulfide-linked human heavy chains, each 
covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a human kappa light chain.  
Each heavy chain (453 amino acids) contains a serine-to-proline substitution at amino acid 234 
(S228P, Eu numbering, designated IgG4P), within the hinge region of the Fc domain. There is a single 
N-linked glycosylation site (Asn303) in each heavy chain, located within the CH2 domain of the Fc 
constant region in the molecule. Based on the primary structure (in the absence of N-linked 
glycosylation), evinacumab has a molecular weight of 146.08 kDa (C6480H9992N1716O2042S46), taking into 
account the formation of 16 disulfide bonds. The light chain consists of 214 amino acids. 
The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) within the heavy and light chain variable domains 
combine to form the binding sites of evinacumab to its target, which is angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3). 
Binding of evinacumab to ANGPTL3 blocks ANGPTL3 from inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, 
which causes decreases in LDL-C and triglyceride (TG) levels i.e. evinacumab blockade of ANGPTL3 
lowers TG and HDL-C by rescuing LPL and EL activities, respectively. Evinacumab leads to reduction in 
LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL receptor (LDLR) by promoting very low-density lipoprotein 
(VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturer(s) 
Evinacumab is manufactured at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron Rensselaer), 81 
Columbia Turnpike Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA. Testing sites and responsibilities are indicated. GMP 
compliance has been demonstrated. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Evinacumab is produced by a cell culture process with recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
that have been engineered to express evinacumab heavy and light chains. A narrative description of 
the cell culture process has been provided.  
Evinacumab protein is expressed by the CHO cells and is secreted into the culture medium.  
The unprocessed bulk is tested for mycoplasma and adventitious viruses which are controlled by 
acceptance criteria. The process is sufficiently controlled by in process controls (IPCs) and in-process 
monitoring. 
The culture is harvested. The implemented controls are considered acceptable.  
A narrative description of the downstream process (DSP) has been provided. The DSP represents a 
standard purification process for monoclonal antibodies consisting of standard chromatographic and

membrane based techniques and includes several steps ensuring adventitious agent safety. The 
material is finally compounded to ≥ 150 mg/mL with excipient buffer resulting in the evinacumab 
formulated active substance (also referred to as FDS) which is filtered and dispensed. FDS containers 
are stored until shipment to the finished product filling site. 
Frozen bottles of FDS are shipped from Regeneron to the receiving site using validated procedures and 
qualified equipment under temperature-controlled conditions. 
Adequate critical parameters and IPCs have been included. For some steps additional controls have 
been implemented (i.e. general process parameters (GPPs), general quality attributes (GQAs)), which 
have been included into the process flow tables as non-critical controls or monitors or are included in 
the process condition columns. This is considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
For purchased compendial raw materials and excipients, Regeneron or a Regeneron-approved contract 
testing laboratory performs identity testing in addition to any tests specified in the individual raw 
material specification. For testing of non-compendial materials no contract laboratory is employed. 
Adequate safety information for biologically sourced materials has been provided in Module A.2 
Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation. 
The evinacumab manufacturing process uses packed bed chromatography resins and different filters. 
Each lot of resin or filter received must meet the manufacturer specification and acceptance criteria as 
specified on the Certificate of Analysis (CoA). For resins Regeneron performs testing in accordance with 
in-house specifications.  
The evinacumab manufacturing process uses single-use bioreactors (SUBs) containers. The 
source/vendor(s) of the SUBs have been provided. With regard to potential extractables and leachables 
a risk evaluation has been provided.  
The evinacumab production cell line was developed using genetic technologies to the assurance of cell-
substrate clonality and stability.  
A traditional two-tiered cell banking system was established. Adventitious agent testing of Master Cell 
Bank (MCB) was conducted as per ICH Q5A requirements. No evidence of viral or microbial 
contamination was observed. A reduced adventitious agent testing of the evinacumab Working Cell 
Bank (WCB) was conducted compared to the MCB testing, which is considered acceptable. In addition, 
virus safety of WCB was also demonstrated. No evidence of viral or microbial contamination was 
observed.  
Stability and homogeneity of the evinacumab production cell line have been evaluated by analysing 
cells from the master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB), and cells collected at the end of 
evinacumab production (end-of-production cells with appropriate methods). 
New evinacumab WCBs will be manufactured from the same MCB in accordance with approved 
manufacturing records and using the same process steps. It is acceptable to introduce these new 
WCBs without regulatory filing provided successful qualification is performed as described. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The IPC program, which includes process monitoring and verification activities to ensure that 
operational/performance parameters and quality attributes are maintained in a state of control with 
minimal risk to process and product, is considered adequate. Process parameters represent process 
inputs, whereas, quality attributes focus on process outputs. Determination of criticality for process 
parameters is based on the parameter’s ability to impact any identified CQAs. CQAs and CPPs are 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
assigned acceptance criteria and critical action limits, respectively, in accordance with standard 
operating procedure (SOPs) and Regeneron policies.  
Non-critical IPCs are classified as either GQAs or GPPs. Activities taken in case of excursions from 
acceptance criteria, critical action limits, and action limits are described. In particular, excursions from 
critical action limits and acceptance criteria are documented and investigated in accordance with a risk-
based response strategy. This is acceptable. Non-critical IPCs are controlled by IPCs and in-process 
monitoring. The definition of non-critical IPCs and in-process monitoring is deemed acceptable. The 
action limits defined for evinacumab in-Process bioburden and endotoxin monitoring are adequate. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The validation of the evinacumab active substance manufacturing process included process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batches, extended hold times validation, Limit of in vitro cell age, 
column and filter (lifetime, cleaning and storage) validation, medium, feed and buffer validation, 
shipping validation and ongoing process verification.   
Consecutive PPQ batches were manufactured and extended holds were performed for all PPQ batches. 
All validation criteria were met. Extended hold times during manufacturing steps were validated. 
Shipping validation of the FDS was performed. 
Manufacturing process development 
During the development of the manufacturing process and its control strategy quality by design (QbD) 
principles have been used. In general, the development and characterisation of the process steps is 
considered comprehensive.  
An earlier process was used to manufacture materials used in non-clinical development as well as 
Phase I and II clinical trials. The commercial process was used to manufacture materials used in Phase 
II and III clinical trials.  
A comparability study was performed in line with ICH Q5E. A process-development QA risk assessment 
report was provided, including a final list of preliminary QAs as well as justifications for selection. The 
approach is considered adequate. Any process parameter that had an impact on the final release CQA 
was deemed critical, in line with ICH Q8 (R2).  
Characterisation 
Elucidation of Structure and Other Characteristics 
Characterisation of the evinacumab FDS was performed on several batches using state-of-the art 
methods. The selection of the FDS batches and methods used is considered adequate. Characterisation 
was performed extensively with a broad range of analytical techniques, including determination of 
primary, secondary, and tertiary structure, charge variants, purity, and potency. The characterisation 
of the structural aspects and biological activities is considered ‘state of the art’.  
Impurities 
The impurities of evinacumab were divided into process- and product-related impurities. Results from 
leachable and extractable studies have been provided.  
Process- and product-related impurities have been characterized and their control strategy described. 
This is considered adequate based on the characterisation studies.

Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The specifications for evinacumab active substance include tests for control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency, and other general tests. The active substance release and shelf life specifications 
have been presented and discussed. 
Release and shelf-life specifications for the FDS are largely identical to the specifications for the 
finished product.   
 Release and end-of-shelf-life specifications are set based on a holistic evaluation of clinical experience, 
safety concerns per regulations, manufacturing and clinical development data, statistical considerations 
derived from manufactured lots, and stability data. In general, the establishment of specifications is 
sufficiently justified.  
Analytical methods 
All analytical procedures are adequately described. Appearance, pH, osmolality, bioburden content, and 
endotoxin content comply with Ph. Eur. The compendial methods used to test FDS have been verified 
for use in accordance with USP and Ph. Eur. requirements. For non-compendial methods, clear system 
suitability criteria and assay validity criteria are defined. For each chromatographic or electrophoretic 
method, examples of chromatograms or electropherograms have been provided. The protein content is 
assayed by OD280 based on a fixed value of the extinction coefficient. The establishment of the 
coefficient has been described, and this extinction coefficient has been verified by an independent 
method.  
Batch analysis 
Release testing results for evinacumab active substance and FDS manufactured using an early 
manufacturing process, as well as FDS manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process 
have been provided. Batch-specific manufacturing details, study usage, and lot genealogy information 
for evinacumab manufactured via the commercial process have been presented. 
Batch data has been presented for several lots. The results from the batch analysis data provided 
confirm the consistency of the commercial manufacturing process and the quality of the active 
substance. 
Reference standards of materials 
A two-tiered system with a primary and working reference standards (RS) has been established for 
evinacumab. The primary RS is used for the establishment of the working RSs and typically not used 
for routine testing. Qualification data demonstrated its suitability as primary RS. The qualification and 
stability acceptance criteria for future primary and working standards have been provided. An initial 
certification is applied, which is supported by annual stability testing and acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system (CCS) for evinacumab FDS is a bottle with a screw cap. Incoming CCS 
batches are sufficiently inspected, and suppliers approved and audited.  
The CCS shows adequate protection against solvent loss, gas permeation, light as well as durability in 
shipment, taking the frozen storage condition of evinacumab FDS intro account.  
Extractable and leachable studies were performed. Based on the review of data, no risk from 
extractables and leachables was identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 21/123 
 
 
 
Bovine tallow is included in the cap of the primary container. As stated, the tallow is produced 
according to the EMEA/410/01 rev.3 guidance.  
The CCS materials are included in the Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation and are concluded as 
safe. 
Overall, the suitability and safety of the container closure system for use with evinacumab has been 
described in sufficient detail and is considered acceptable. 
Evinacumab FDS is filled into the bottles, frozen and stored at the recommended storage conditions. 
Frozen bottles of FDS are packed on dry ice during routine shipment to the filler. 
Stability 
Stability studies were performed to evaluate the effects of long-term storage, temperature stress, light 
exposure, and freeze-thaw cycles on protein quality and to establish a shelf life, as well as recommend 
storage conditions for the active substance. 
The evinacumab active substance stability program includes multiple batches. In line with ICH Q5C the 
batches were tested under long-term, accelerated and stress conditions. Furthermore, photostability, 
freeze-thaw cycle and forced degradation (including harsh chemical and temperature conditions) 
studies were performed. All acceptance criteria were met and only slight changes, possibly due to 
method variability, were detected. The data support the initial set  
Overall, the analytical methods used are considered sufficiently sensitive and able to detect the main 
degradation pathways of evinacumab active substance. 
Taken together, it can be concluded that the used analytical methods are sufficiently stable.  
Based on the stability results the claimed shelf life for the active substance is considered acceptable. 
Stability studies for the primary stability batches will continue through the final protocol time point. An 
adequate post-approval stability protocol has been provided, and it has been committed that all 
stability studies will be completed and that a minimum of one batch of evinacumab active substance 
will be put on long-term stability at the recommended storage condition every year that manufacturing 
of such batches occurs. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a sterile, preservative free, concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Evkeeza finished product is supplied in vials containing 150 mg of evinacumab per ml as active 
substance. Other ingredients are: arginine hydrochloride, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, proline, 
histidine, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI). The qualitative and quantitative composition 
of the finished product is has been provided. 
The product is available in a single-use 3 mL (345 mg, 2.3 mL extractable volume) or 20 ml (1200 mg, 
8 mL extractable volume) glass (Type I) vial with a grey elastomeric stopper and a seal cap with a flip-
off button.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021

The product has undergone a development process to optimize the formulation. The final commercial 
formulation (150 mg/mL evinacumab, histidine, arginine hydrochloride (arginine-HCl), proline, and 
polysorbate 80) shows adequate stability under long-term, accelerated and stress conditions.  
Different fill volumes were tested for their impact on stability under stress conditions. The degradation 
profiles provided are comparable, demonstrating that the fill volume has no significant impact on the 
tested CQAs and that the research fill volume (5.0 mL fill volume in 20 mL glass vials) is comparable to 
the commercial fillings. Data from a formulation robustness study showed that minor variations in the 
excipient or evinacumab concentration or pH value does not significantly impact evinacumab quality 
parameters.    
Overages 
The evinacumab finished product does not include overages. To ensure that a 2.3 or 8.0 mL nominal 
volume can be delivered from the vials, there is an overfill. This is justified and appropriate. 
Manufacturing process development 
The selection of the final formulation of the evinacumab finished product has been sufficiently 
described and has been adequately justified. Multiple doses have been introduced for the new 150 
mg/mL concentration. As stated, only the 345 mg and the 1,200 mg forms will be marketed.  
An overview of changes implemented during the manufacturing processes has been provided. For all 
changes, their potential impact on the product quality was assessed. Changes in the manufacturing 
process between finished product forms were considered minor, with an anticipated low risk to product 
quality, and this can be accepted. A comparability study in line with ICH Q5E was provided 
demonstrating that all 150 mg/mL presentations are comparable. Also, a comparability study to the 
former presentation, used during clinical development, has been provided. 
The manufacturing process has been described in detail. It consists of thawing/pooling/mixing, 
bioburden reduction filtration, sterilising filtration, aseptic filling/stoppering/capping/tray loading, and 
100% visual inspection. Process parameters were adequately defined and ranked as CPPs or GPPs 
based on manufacturing experience gained during development or by manufacturer´s specification 
(e.g. filter integrity test parameters). Assigned parameter ranges were verified during PPQ testing.  
Extractable and leachable studies were performed including worse-case conditions. Detected 
components or elements were evaluated according to ICH M7 or ICH Q3D. No unexpected 
extractable/leachable was found and the amounts detected in the leachable study do not raise a 
concern. 
The container closure system has been sufficiently described. Extractable and leachable studies 
revealed no compounds potentially present in the finished product originating from the container 
closure materials at reasonable concentrations.   
As to its nature evinacumab finished product cannot be finally sterilized by heat and does not include 
preservatives. Therefore, sterility is ensured by sterile filtration, release testing for sterility and 
endotoxins and container closure integrity (CCI). The vials and stoppers used are commonly employed 
as packaging for biotechnological products.  
Compatibility 
Evinacumab is administered by infusion, diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose 
infusion bags. Compatibility between the finished product and commonly used IV solutions, bags, 
pumps, IV sets and filters has been demonstrated under conditions expected during infusions. A 
microbial challenge and in-use stability study was included into the program. The data show that the 
Assessment report

diluted evinacumab can be stored at room temperature up to 25°C for no more than 6 hours and 2°C 
to 8°C for no more than 24 hours.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer(s) 
Information on the manufacturing sites used for evinacumab finished product including their 
responsibilities has been sufficiently provided. Sufficient GMP documentation has been provided. 
Batch formula 
There are two finished product forms: a 345 mg vial and a 1200 mg vial of evinacumab finished 
product. The finished product batch size range has been stated as number of vials for each finished 
product form (345 mg and 1200 mg). The batch formula for a typical batch size of each vial 
presentation (345 mg and 1200 mg) has been presented.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls   
The evinacumab manufacturing process consists of thawing, pooling/mixing, bioburden reduction 
filtration, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering, capping, tray loading and 100% inspection of 
filled vials. The filled vials are transferred a facility where labelling and secondary packaging takes 
place.  
A flow-diagram including incoming process components, process parameters and IPCs has been 
provided. Each step has been further described in sufficient detail. Process parameters and in process 
tests have been classified by criticality as general or critical during development. In this section only 
critical parameters and IPCs have been included. However, for some steps additional controls have 
been implemented (i.e. GPPs, GQAs), which are considered important to ensure a highly controlled 
state of the manufacturing process. Moreover, to have a good overview of the controls in place the 
GPPs and GQAs were included into section P.3.3 (flow-chart and description). The assigned ranges are 
considered adequate to ensure sufficient control of the manufacturing process.  
No critical process parameters of IPCs have been identified for the secondary packaging which is 
considered adequate.  
Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical steps during the manufacturing of the evinacumab finished product have been identified during 
manufacturing development. Adequate CPPs and IPCs are implemented to ensure a controlled state of 
the manufacturing process and of finished product quality attributes. For each process step a maximal 
processing time has been assigned and verified during process validation. A maximal processing time 
was implemented for this step based on data from the process validation runs.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The aseptic filling process was adequately validated. Container closure integrity is sufficiently 
controlled. 
Media fills are performed to assure that the filling is operated under aseptic conditions. Data from the 
most recent fillings confirm that the filling line is appropriately controlled for aseptic filling of 
evinacumab finished product. 
The validation of the evinacumab finished product was separated into two separate studies, one for 
each strength (1,200 mg and 345 mg). Several consecutive batches were tested in each study.

Overall, all predefined acceptance criteria were met, and the recorded data validate the assigned IPCs 
and CPPs set for the control of manufacturing.  
Shipping validation was performed as a transport simulation qualification and as a real-world transport 
qualification. A brief summary has been provided, which is considered acceptable.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The release specifications for evinacumab finished product are largely identical to the specifications for 
the active substance. The finished product specifications for release and shelf life includes tests for 
appearance, pH, identity, potency, purity/impurities, endotoxin and sterility. The finished product 
release and shelf life specifications are summarised. 
Some of the analytical procedures used for control testing of evinacumab finished product are also 
used for the active substance (appearance, colour, pH, total protein content, charge variant analysis, 
potency, purity and bacterial endotoxin). Specific analytical methods for the finished product cover 
product solution properties, identity, strength, potency, purity and performance properties.  
A detailed discussion of each potential finished product impurity has been provided. The discussion 
includes details on the source of each impurity, actual levels of each impurity found in manufactured 
finished product lots, and details of the control strategy. The data are derived from in-process and 
release testing of the finished product PPQ lots, historical batch data from analysis of all lots produced 
to date, additional characterization testing of finished product lots manufactured using the commercial 
process, and studies performed on raw materials used in the manufacture of evinacumab. 
A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities in line with ICH Q3D has been included. It 
can be concluded that the risk and the impact on patient safety associated with the presence of 
elemental impurities is negligible. Specific control on elemental impurities are considered not needed. 
This is agreed. 
Upon request, the Applicant provided a risk assessment concerning the potential presence of 
nitrosamines in the product applying the principles outlined in the “Assessment report Procedure under 
Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004” (EMA/369136/2020). The assessment was based on the 
risk factors identified within the revised EMA Questions and answers on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products (EMA/409815/2020). Based on this assessment the Applicant concluded 
that there is no risk associated with nitrosamines for Evkeeza finished product, and this conclusion can 
be agreed.  
Analytical methods 
Detailed method procedure descriptions for all analytical procedures used for release and stability 
testing have been provided. If the procedure is conducted according to a Pharmacopeial monograph 
and this monograph provides all details to reproduce the procedure, then a reference to the 
monograph is made. Validation and qualification information demonstrating that the non-compendial 
analytical procedures used for testing evinacumab finished product are suitable for their intended 
purpose have been provided. 
Overall, the method descriptions are found acceptable and sufficiently detailed.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses from several lots have been provided and the results confirm compliance with the 
specifications. Overall the results comply well with the acceptance criteria and demonstrate a 
satisfactory batch to batch consistency.

Reference standards or materials 
Reference is made to the respective active substance section, which is considered acceptable given 
that there is no major difference between the evinacumab active substance and finished product. A full 
description of the reference standard program can be found in the active substance section.  
Container closure system 
The evinacumab finished product CCS consists of a 3 mL or 20 mL glass vial made of Type I clear 
glass, compliant with Ph. Eur. <3.2.1>, a chlorobutyl stopper and a 13 mm or 20 mm aluminium seal 
cap with flip-off buttons. The stopper material is manufactured to comply with Ph. Eur. <3.2.9>. 
The glass vial and stopper are in immediate contact with the finished product and comply with 
applicable compendial requirements. All components are tested in-house according to SOPs. If a 
qualified supplier is used a reduced panel of testing will be employed.  
Extractable studies were performed and a leachable study was started and is still ongoing until the end 
of shelf life. No risk from extractables and leachables was identified so far. Leachables will continue to 
be monitored through the end of shelf life according to the leachable study protocol.  
Overall, the CCS is considered to provide sufficient finished product protection against microbial 
contamination and adequate for long-term storage as supported by stability studies performed with 
identical CCS materials. The control strategy in place for the CCS qualification is adequate. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months when stored between 2-8°C and protected from light is claimed for the 
finished product.  
Stability studies were performed in accordance with ICH recommended long-term and accelerated 
storage conditions. Long-term stability data are available and at the recommended storage conditions, 
no changes were observed.  
The overall photostability analysis indicates that evinacumab finished product is photosensitive and 
should be protected from light during storage. Appropriate storage instructions have been included in 
the proposed SmPC in regard to storage temperature and protection from light.   
Based on the stability data provided a shelf life of 36 months for the finished product when stored 
between 2-8°C and protected from light is considered acceptable for the unopened vial. Once opened, 
the medicinal product should be diluted and infused immediately. 
After dilution and from a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, it is the responsibility of the user to follow the in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use. 
If the diluted solution is not administered immediately, it may be stored temporarily either: 
- under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C for no more than 24 hours from the time of infusion 
preparation to the end of the infusion 
or 
- at room temperature up to 25°C for no more than 6 hours from the time of infusion 
preparation to the end of the infusion.

The Applicant commits to completing the stability studies of the primary evinacumab finished product 
batches at the long-term storage condition of 5 ± 3°C in accordance with the stability protocol 
provided.  
Adventitious agents 
Evkeeza is a recombinant monoclonal antibody produced in recombinant CHO cells. The purification of 
the antibody includes several steps for virus removal or inactivation, some of which have been 
validated for virus reduction. The final finished product is formulated with known excipients and there 
are no novel excipients. 
TSE compliance 
None of the materials used during preparation of MCB, WCB or during Evkeeza manufacture is of direct 
animal origin. None of the excipients in the final finished product is of animal origin. Animal-derived 
materials were used in cell line development. Their compliance with the TSE Guideline “Minimising the 
risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
products” EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3 has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
Virus safety 
No materials of direct animal or human origin were used during cell banking or are used in the Evkeeza 
manufacturing process. None of the excipients is of human or animal origin. The MCB, WCB and an 
end-of-production cell bank have been tested sufficiently for adventitious viruses as well as 
retroviruses and according to ICH Q5A. Testing reports were provided for final assessment. Bulk 
harvests are routinely tested for adventitious viruses according to ICH Q5A. No viral contaminants 
have been found within the cell banks and in the bulk harvest of several batches tested so far except 
for retrovirus-like particles (RVLP). The presence of RVLP is well known for CHO cells and is acceptable 
because there is enough capacity in the purification process of Evkeeza to remove them.  
The purification process includes several chromatography steps, a low pH treatment step and virus 
retentive filtration. Four of these steps have been validated in appropriately designed small scale 
studies for virus reduction using model viruses. It was shown that two of the steps were effective for 
removal of a wide range of viruses as all model viruses were reduced by more the 4 log10. Another step 
is effective for inactivation of enveloped viruses. Additionally, another chromatography step contributes 
to overall virus reduction. A retrovirus risk assessment was performed, demonstrating sufficient 
clearance for the CHO cell-derived RVLP.  
In summary, the virus safety of Evkeeza has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality standard of the Module 3 Quality dossier presented in support of this application for 
evinacumab is adequate for Marketing Aurthorisation, with the descriptions of the manufacture and 
control of the active substance and finished product containing sufficient detail to permit an in-depth 
assessment of the marketing authorisation application.  
Based on the review of the provided quality data the marketing authorisation application for Evkeeza is 
considered approvable from the quality point of view.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Evkeeza is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions as 
defined in the SmPC.  
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are 
set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated.  
The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro characterisation of evinacumab binding  
Affinity binding of evinacumab to ANGPTL3 of various species was assessed with surface plasmon 
resonance. Evinacumab binds with high affinity to human ANGPTL3 isoforms (KD<2 nM) and the 
ANGPTL3 full-length protein (KD<1 nM) Binding of evinacumab to rabbit and rat ANGPTL3 was shown 
to be in the low micromolar range (KD= 1.9µM for rabbit) and approximately 3 times higher for rat 
(KD = 670nM). Evinacumab bound to monkey ANGPTL3 with a KD of 2,6 nM. Thus, these species are 
considered to be responder species for evinacumab activity. This was further demonstrated in a 
functional assay where evinacumab promoted lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity after blocking human 
ANGPTL3 (IC50 = 5.4-6.4 nM); monkey ANGPTL3 (IC50 = 20.7 nM); rat ANGPTL3 (IC50 = 9.8nM); 
and mouse ANGPTL3 (IC50 = 105.5 nM). No potentiation of LPL was observed when evinacumab was 
incubated with human or mouse ANGPTL4 or human ANGPTL5. Similarly, the ability of evinacumab to 
promote endothelial lipase activity (LIPG) was also demonstrated (potentiation LIPG activity after 
ANGPTL3 blockade with IC50 values of 96, 30, 61, and 84nM using human, monkey, rat and mouse 
ANGPTL3, respectively). The ability of evinacumab to induce ADCC, CDC or to activate complement 
was evaluated in human-derived HepG2 and Hep3B cells with or without the addition of exogenous 
human ANGPTL3. In contrast to positive control antibodies (including rituximab), evinacumab was 
unable to elicit ADCC, nor CDC responses. This is in line with evinacumab belonging to the IgG4 class 
of antibodies. Similarly, Evinacumab did not activate C1q, suggesting that evinacumab mediated 
complement activation is not likely.

In vivo mode of action and proof of concept of evinacumab mediated modification of lipid profiles 
The pharmacology of evinacumab was further investigated in vivo. The ability of evinacumab to reduce 
serum triglyceride levels after a single administration was evaluated in Lipg-/- mice, normolipidemic 
C57Bl/6 mice, hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- and Ldlr-/- mice, and diabetic dyslipidemic db/db mice. 
Furthermore, the effect of weekly evinacumab administration to C57Bl/6 mice fed a high-fat, high-
cholesterol diet was evaluated (also see table 3.2.1.1.).  
In normolipidemic C57Bl/6 mice, a single SC administration of 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg evinacumab, but not 
1 mg/kg evinacumab, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of circulating triglyceride levels (TG), 
total cholesterol (TChol), non-high-density cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and high-density cholesterol levels 
(HDL-C. Reductions in TG levels were profound and prolonged (up to 25 days in animals receiving 10 
or 25 mg/kg evinacumab).  LDL-C levels were not significantly altered after administration of 
evinacumab. Total ANGPTL3 levels were elevated in animals receiving evinacumab demonstrating the 
formation of antibody-ANGPTL3 complexes.  
Administration of a single dose of evinacumab in Lipg-/- and wt-litter mates resulted in marked 
reductions of serum TG. Evinacumab also reduced T-Chol and HDL-C in wild-type littermates, but not 
in Lipg-/- mice, demonstrating that this is dependent on LPL activity. Evinacumab did not alter LDL-C 
in either wild-type nor Lipg-/- mice.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 29/123 
 
 
 
 
Administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg evinacumab in hyperlipidemic ApoE knockout mice 
resulted in a significantly decreased level of TG, TChol, non-HDL-C and HDL-C and a trend towards 
decreased LDL-C compared to mice given control antibody.  
A single administration of 10 mg/kg evinacumab in Ldlr knockout mice (a model for familial 
hypercholesterolemia) resulted in marked decreases in TG, LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C and 
HDL-C compared to mice given control antibody, and was independent of LDLR.  
In a subsequent series of experiments, evinacumab was shown to reduce TG, total cholesterol, VLDL, 
LDL, and HDL after 3 weekly administrations to Ldlr-/- mice. Following this, evinacumab was 
administered to a double knockout Ldlr-/- Lipg-/- mouse model, and therefore in the absence of both 
EL and LDLR. A single administration of 10 mg/kg evinacumab reduced levels of circulating TG 
compared with isotype control, consistent with the ability of evinacumab to indirectly upregulate LPL 
activity. The ability of evinacumab to reduce serum lipids was limited in Lipg-/- Ldlr-/- mice, 
demonstrating that the LDLR-independent cholesterol- and phospholipid-lowering effect of evinacumab 
is attributed to blocking ANGPTL3-mediated inhibition of EL. In a third study, ApoE-/- mice were used 
to assess lipid clearance because VLDL clearance is too rapid to adequately measure in Ldlr-/- mice. 
Animals were given 2 once-weekly doses of 10mg/kg evinacumab. VLDL and LDL from these animals 
were isolated, purified, labelled and reinjected in untreated ApoE-/- mice. Evinacumab-driven 
modifications on VLDL led to faster clearance of these particles, compared with VLDL from mice treated 
with isotype control. Evinacumab treatment had no impact on LDL clearance rates, suggesting that 
evinacumab-driven LDL-C reduction occurs through accelerated clearance of VLDL, upstream of LDL 
formation.  
In further studies, a single dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg evinacumab was administered to db/db mice (mouse 
model of obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia), which resulted in a marked decrease in serum TG and 
LDL-C and non-significantly reduced non-HDL-C. Total cholesterol or HDL-C was unaffected compared 
to mice given control antibody. Evinacumab and had no effect on hepatic lipase activity. However, and 
in contrast to C75Bl/6 and ApoE-/- mice, db/db mice were noted to have 2-5 times higher ANGPTL4 
levels. It is considered by the applicant that this could account for reduced LPL activity in this model. 
The ability of evinacumab to reduce serum lipids was evaluated in C57Bl/6 mice fed a high fat 
‘western’ diet after repeated administration. Evinacumab was able to reduce serum TG levels, total 
cholesterol and LDL-C. HDL-C was also statistically significantly reduced. The reductions were 
maintained for 8 weeks, which was also the duration of the study. Administration of evinacumab had 
no effect on body weight, white adipose tissue or heart weight. There were no effects of weekly 
evinacumab administration on ALT/AST ratio or hepatic TG content at the end of the study. 
In vivo proof of concept on cardiovascular protection after prolonged administration of evinacumab 
Effects of evinacumab on atherosclerosis were evaluated in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice, which is 
considered a well-established model. Mice were fed a Western diet and were administered weekly 
doses of evinacumab for 13 weeks. Consistent with other models, TG and lipid levels were markedly 
reduced, with the exception of HDL-C. Atherosclerotic lesion size and the area of the necrotic core was 
reduced in evinacumab treated animals compared to control animals. However, there were no 
significant differences in a number of lesions, undiseased segments or in lesion severity.   
In the same model (APOE*3Leiden.CETP tg mice) animals were fed a western diet and atherosclerosis 
was induced for 13 weeks prior to treatment. Evinacumab was administered to animals alone or in 
combination with atorvastatin, alirocumab or both for 25 weeks. Combination treatment with 
atorvastatin and evinacumab or alirocumab and evinacumab significantly blocked the progression of 
established atherosclerosis in  APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. Triple treatment with evinacumab and 
Assessment report

Page 30/123 
 
 
 
alirocumab on top of atorvastatin regressed atherosclerosis, also improved plaque phenotype, and 
reduced the proliferation of macrophages in the plaques. 
The totality of evidence suggests that evinacumab is effective in dose-dependently lowering serum 
lipids in multiple mouse models. Evinacumab lowers serum lipids by inhibiting ANGPTL3 and promoting 
very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation. The ability of 
evinacumab alone to reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaques has been demonstrated in a 
relevant model of disease, but without reducing other relevant markers. In this animal model of 
atherosclerosis, combination treatment with approved lipid-lowering therapies blocked disease 
progression when given as a double combination or reversed it when given as a triple combination. The 
reduction of cardiovascular risk in the patient population at large should nevertheless be demonstrated 
clinically. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The absence of secondary pharmacology studies is acknowledged. ADCC, CDC and complement 
activation has been assessed as part of the primary pharmacology. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Formal safety pharmacology studies in accordance with ICH S7 are not required for monoclonal 
antibodies, which is in line with ICH S6(R1). Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, which did not suggest that evinacumab poses a risk to the cardiovascular 
system, respiratory system or the CNS. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Evinacumab single dose (IV and SC) pharmacokinetics were assessed in rats and monkeys. Repeat 
dose toxicokinetics of evinacumab were assessed from toxicology studies (IV and SC, QW) in studies 
up to 13 weeks in rats and 26 weeks in monkeys, in juvenile rats and rabbits and as part of the 
reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in pregnant rats and rabbits as well as in fetuses. 
Methods of analysis 
For the quantification of total evinacumab in rat, rabbit and monkey serum, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods based on capture by mouse anti-human IgG4 monoclonal 
antibody and detection by biotinylated mouse anti-human immunoglobulin (Ig), kappa light chain 
specific, mAb were used. The provided validation reports demonstrate that the assays were sensitive, 
selective and suitable to assess evinacumab concentrations in serum. The lower and upper limits of 
quantitation (LLOQ and ULOQ) were in the range of 0.078 µg/ml - 5 µg/ml.  
For the detection of antibodies against evinacumab, a non-quantitative, titer-based, bridging assay 
based on electrochemiluminescence was used. The assay detects ADA generated against the constant 
regions of a human IgG4 antibody (including evinacumab). Although it is noted that rats do not have 
IgG4, the ADA method was validated for the detection of ADA against REGN846 in monkey and rat 
serum, but was not validated for rabbit serum and neither for anti-REGN1500 (evinacumab) 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021

antibodies. According to the applicant, sensitivity is approximately 9.2, 24.3, and 7.0 ng/mL in neat 
rat, rabbit, and monkey serum, respectively. The values mentioned for rat and monkey correspond to 
the sensitivity values for REGN846, but cannot simply be used for evinacumab. Drug tolerance is 
approximately 206, 153, and 257 μg/mL of evinacumab in rat, rabbit, and monkey serum. It is noted 
that the drug tolerance level was generally exceeded in the samples from the doses ≥30 mg/kg in all 
evaluated species, suggesting that the ADA response may be underestimated at these dose levels. 
In addition, the presence of neutralizing antibodies has not been assessed. 
Absorption 
A single-dose pharmacokinetic study was performed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, with IV and SC 
doses of 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg bw. In both species, the PK of evinacumab is characterized by a brief 
distribution (IV) or absorption (SC) phase (Tmax was 36 to 72 hours in rat and 20-106 hours in 
monkey), followed by a linear beta elimination phase and a target-mediated clearance (TMC) phase, 
with a prolonged linear elimination phase (post-TMC phase) observed at very low concentrations. In 
line with the non-linear kinetics, plasma clearance decreased with increasing doses (from 1.27 to 0.32 
ml/h/kg in rats and from 1.3 to 0.14 ml/h/kg in monkeys). Cmax followed an approximately 
proportional (IV) or greater than proportional (SC) increase with increasing dose. A greater than 
proportional increase in exposure (AUC) with increasing dose was observed. Terminal elimination half-
life (T1/2) ranged from 84-146 hours in rats and 134 to 242 hours in monkeys. 
The SC bioavailability of evinacumab was approximately 37-84% in rats and 39-82% in the monkey.  
There were no apparent gender differences in exposure.  
Multiple-dose toxicokinetic studies (IV and SC, QW) were performed in rat (5 and 13 weeks) and 
cynomolgus monkeys (5, 13 and 26 weeks) at dose levels of 10-100 mg/kg bw. Absorption of 
evinacumab was slow after multiple SC dosing, with Tmax ranging from 28-96h (but mostly between 
48 and 72h). After repeated exposure, systemic exposure of evinacumab increased in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner. Accumulation ratios (based on AUC) in rat and monkey were 
low to moderate (1.3-5.1 for once-weekly IV and 1.7-4.7 for once-weekly SC) and increased with 
increasing study duration. Steady-state was achieved after approximately 7 weekly doses in the 13-
week study in rats and after approximately 12 weekly doses in the 26-week study in monkeys. 
Toxicokinetics were also assessed in juvenile toxicity studies and EFD in rats (administration every 3 or 
7 days) and rabbits (administration every 3 or 5 days) as well as in the male fertility study in rabbits 
and the female fertility/PPND study in rats. Also in these studies, exposure increased in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner, although in the EFD studies in rabbits in which lower dose 
levels (1-100 mg/kg) were used, this was slightly greater than dose-proportional. 
There were no consistent sex-related differences in evinacumab exposure following repeated IV or SC 
dosing. 
Distribution 
Formal tissue distribution and protein binding studies were not conducted with evinacumab, which is 
acceptable. Evinacumab has a normal volume of distribution (54.3-98.4 ml/kg in rat and 53.2 to 75.6 
mL/kg in monkey), suggesting moderate extravascular distribution. 
Fetal exposure to evinacumab was demonstrated in the Embryo-Fetal Development Studies in rat and 
rabbit, as well as in a PPND study in rats. In rats dosed 5-100 mg/kg bw once weekly (IV) from GD 6 
to GD 18, the ratio of fetal and maternal total evinacumab concentration) at GD 21 ranged from 0.419 
to 0.619. In an EFD study in rabbits, evinacumab was detected in fetuses from 3 of the 16 maternal 
females in the 10 mg/kg dose group and in fetuses from 7 of the 10 maternal females in the 30 mg/kg 
Assessment report

Page 32/123 
 
 
 
dose group on GD 29. Concentrations in fetal serum were typically equal to or more than those 
observed in maternal serum, probably due to the large impact of ADAs. In a PPND study in rabbits, 
detectable concentrations of evinacumab were observed in all foetuses at GD21 as well as in all pooled 
samples from litters on PND7 and in 12 of 22 F1 animals  through maturation day 63. In conclusion, 
fetal exposure was observed in rats as well as rabbits 
In addition, in a male fertility study in rabbits, with doses up to 300 mg/kg, detectable concentrations 
of total evinacumab were observed in seminal plasma (median percentage of total evinacumab 
concentrations in seminal plasma relative to total evinacumab concentrations in serum was 0.6%). 
Distribution to milk has not been investigated. However, since it is known that many immunoglobulins 
are excreted in human milk, this may also be expected for evinacumab. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies with evinacumab were conducted in animals. The absence of metabolism 
studies is in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and is agreed with. 
Excretion 
As evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody, no renal excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. 
Therefore, no specific studies to measure excretion of evinacumab were conducted. The absence of 
excretion studies in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and is agreed with.  
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of evinacumab in rats and monkeys was assessed in all PK and toxicity studies.  
Positive ADA responses in the rat studies varied between 0 and 19% of treated animals (0-43% per 
dose group), with higher incidences at lower dose levels in the single-dose study, but independent 
from dose in the repeated dose studies. In general, the presence of ADA was associated with a 
corresponding reduction in exposure to evinacumab compared to that of ADA negative animals. In 
addition to the ADA positive animals, several ADA negative animals (especially from the higher dose 
groups) showed a decline in the concentration-time profiles consistent with the development of ADAs. 
It is noted that the majority of the measured concentrations of total evinacumab in dose groups (≥ 30 
mg/kg) exceeded the DTL, suggesting that the actual amount of ADA positive animals may be much 
higher. Concentration values from animals considered to be impacted by ADA (either by positive ADA 
test or suspected concentration-time profile) were excluded from NCA.  
Furthermore, although concentrations of evinacumab remain relatively high, it is not clear whether the 
presence of ADAs prevents binding of evinacumab to its target and thereby reduces efficacy (i.e. 
neutralizing ADAs). 
In rabbit 2-88% of treated animals tested positive for ADA’s (0-100% per dose group). The incidence 
of ADA was inversely dose-dependent across all dose groups following multiple dosing in adult rabbits, 
with a higher incidence of ADA observed at doses ≤30 mg/kg. In juvenile rabbits, the pattern was 
independent of dose. In animals that tested positive for ADA, the presence of ADA was typically 
associated with a corresponding reduction in evinacumab plasma concentrations. Also in rabbits, the 
majority of samples (especially ≥30 mg/kg) were above the DTL. For rabbits, however, presence of 
ADAs did not result in exclusion from analysis. It is noted that ADAs were also observed in 50-94% of 
control animals. No validation results have been provided for the assay in rabbit plasma (as was done 
for rat and monkey for another antibody). 
In monkey, 3-28% of treated animals tested positive for ADAs (0-50% per dose group). The incidence 
of a positive ADA response was inversely dose-dependent across dose groups following a single dose, 
but dose-independent across dose groups following multiple doses. In animals that tested positive for

ADA, the presence of ADA was typically associated with a corresponding reduction in exposure to 
evinacumab. Although evinacumab concentrations were below the DTL in the majority of samples in 
the single-dose PK study, the majority of samples in the repeated dose studies had evinacumab 
concentrations exceeding the DTL, indicating that the presence of ADAs may be underestimated. 
Indeed, in addition to the ADA positive animals, also a low percentage of monkeys that tested negative 
in the ADA assay (≤17%) exhibited concentration-time profiles characteristic for ADA presence. 
Concentration values from animals considered to be impacted by ADA were excluded from NCA.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-drug interaction at the PK level is highly unlikely for this type of product since biotechnology-
derived substances do not metabolize via CYP P450 enzymes. However, the mechanism of action may 
have an effect on CYP450 activities. The Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) will be 
assessed in the clinical AR. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicology studies have been conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity of evinacumab was studied in rats and monkeys, for up to 13 and 26 weeks 
respectively at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week. Both SC and IV slow bolus dosing was used in all studies; 
however, in the pivotal monkey 26-week study IV dosing was only performed with the control and high 
dose groups. However, since no adverse effects were seen in any of the studies, this is sufficient.  
Rats: From the pharmacology studies, it was shown that evinacumab binds to the target ANGPTL3 of 
rats, and therefore rats are a suitable species for toxicology testing. However, there was no effect on 
cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the pivotal rat toxicology studies. No pharmacological or 
toxicological effects were seen in the rat studies, and therefore the NOAEL is set at 100 mg/kg/week 
IV, resulting in a safety margin of 4.6 based on AUC. 
Monkey: Evinacumab is pharmacologically active in the cynomolgus monkey, as evidenced by 
decreases in triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL-C levels. However, no consistent effects were seen 
on LDL-C levels, as only a few animals showed a decrease after treatment. There were no adverse 
effects in any of the monkey studies, resulting in a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/week IV, and a safety margin 
of 14.7 based on AUC.  
In addition to the general parameters investigated in the repeated dose studies, additional endpoints 
on the cardiovascular system, respiratory system and central nervous system were included to meet 
the requirements of safety pharmacology testing. Additionally, female menstrual cycle and male 
reproductive parameters were studied in the 26-week monkey study, without any adverse effects 
reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 34/123 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were performed. Considering the nature of the product, this 
is in line with guidance from ICH S6 and agreed. In a Carcinogenicity Risk Assessment it is concluded 
that blockade of ANGPTL3 is unlikely to contribute to an increased cancer risk. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Female fertility: There were no effects on fertility or early embryonic development study in rats when 
dosed up to 100 mg/kg SC evinacumab every 3 days. 
Males fertility: Evinacumab was not well tolerated in treated male rabbits, with 3 mortalities in both 
groups of 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg IV dosed every 5 days. Causes for mortality were haemorrhage, 
inflammation, interstitial nephritis of the kidney and dehydration. Surviving males had lower body 
weight gain, lower heart weights and marked kidney adverse effects. Lower fecundity index is likely 
due to lesser health status of the male animals. There is no paternal NOAEL. There was an increased 
incidence of unossified caudal vertebrae at the highest dose. However, this is unlikely to be treatment-
related, since it is within historical controls for fetal incidence, and it is unlikely that evinacumab in 
sperm can elicit such an effect. Therefore, the NAOEL for fertility and early embryonic development is 
300 mg/kg every 5 days. Overall, there is no effect on fertility or early embryonic development in 
female rats and male rabbits up to exposures 3.6- and 30-fold of the MHRD respectively, based on 
AUC. 
In the embryofoetal development study in rats, pharmacological-related effects were seen in all dose 
groups (decreased triglyceride levels). Treatment-related findings on the offspring were only observed 
at the highest dose, where there was an increase in bipartite ossification of the thoracic centrum. This 
is a variation that is not considered of much relevance for human. Also noted was an increased 
incidence of absent innominate artery, but this effect is likely a background effect and not evinacumab-
related since the incidence was within the historical control range. Due to these findings, the NOAEL for 
embryofetal development in the rat is 30 mg/kg, which is <1-fold human exposure. 
Pregnant rabbits did not tolerate treatment with evinacumab well, resulting in decreases in maternal 
body weight, leading to mortalities, abortions and resorptions. The F1 generation was also effected by 
decreased body weight, and from a dose of 10 mg/kg domed head, cleft palate, flexed hindlimbs and 
ventricular dilatation of the brain were observed. The exposure at this dose is below the MHRD. The 
relevance of these findings for humans is unclear, due to the accompanying maternal toxicity, and the 
different lipid profile during pregnancy in rabbits compared to humans. Embryotoxicity has been 
identified as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
There were no effects on pre- or postnatal development in rats when dosed up to 100 mg/kg SC every 
3 days, leading to exposures of 3.6-fold of the MHRD, based on AUC. 
The safety of evinacumab was assessed in both juvenile rats and juvenile rabbits. Evinacumab was 
administered to rats once weekly from PND21 through PND84. No test-article related changes with the 
exception of increased total protein and globulin levels in the 100 mg/kg IV and SC groups and A/G 
ratios were decreased as a result of increased protein load due to the dose. Histopathological evidence 
of injection site reactions was noted in animals given evinacumab via the SC route. These findings 
were fully reversible. Consistent with the intended pharmacology of evinacumab, and in contrast with 
adult rat toxicology studies, TG; HDL; and cholesterol levels were decreased all evinacumab groups. 
The NOAEL was considered to be 100mg/kg for either IV and SC routes, which was 5.1 times higher 
than the anticipated clinical exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 35/123 
 
 
 
In the pivotal juvenile toxicity study, rabbits were given evinacumab once every 5 days from PND 21 
through PND 141 via slow bolus IV injection. Animals received 0, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg evinacumab. 
Mortality in this study was considerable. Eight animals in the control group were found dead or were 
euthanised, 5 animals in the 30 mg/kg group, 8 animals in the 100 mg/kg group, and 12 animals in 
the 300 mg/kg group. The applicant considers that these deaths were not evinacumab-related due to 
the findings in these animals and the absence of overt toxicity in the study. This is acknowledged. 
Apart from the expected findings of reduced TG and lipid levels, there were no remarkable evinacumab 
related findings. There were no evinacumab related effects on reproductive performance in males or 
females, intrauterine growth and survival or fetal morphology. The NOAEL was considered to be 300 
mg/kg, which was 21.4 times higher than the anticipated clinical exposure. 
In conclusion, apart from the intended pharmacological action, there were no adverse findings in 
juvenile animals. Therefore, there is no evidence that juvenile animals are more sensitive to 
evinacumab administration compared to adult animals. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance of evinacumab has been evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies. There are no 
findings to suggest that evinacumab will be an irritant or result in local tolerability issues. 
Other toxicity studies 
In a GLP compliant ex-vivo tissue cross-reactivity study, no specific evinacumab binding was observed 
in any human, cynomolgus monkey or rat tissue. In contrast, a positive control (rhAngPTL3) was 
positive for evinacumab binding, whereas there was no staining with a negative control (DLL3). 
There was no evidence that evinacumab had immunotoxic potential in repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Furthermore, evinacumab did not affect haematological parameters in these studies. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A justification for not performing an environmental risk assessment studies was submitted in line with 
the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (ERA 
Guideline) (1) because evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring 
amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, "Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment." The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, evinacumab is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The totality of evidence suggests that evinacumab is effective in dose-dependently lowering serum 
lipids in multiple mouse models. In dyslipidemic, diabetic db/db mice, evinacumab caused a reduction 
in TG and LDL-C, without effect on total cholesterol or HDL-C. In this mouse strain, a significant 
increase in TG levels was observed in animals treated with control Ab compared to the pre-bleed 
values. Since the effect of evinacumab was presented as "% from control Ab" an increase in TG in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 36/123 
 
 
 
control animals suggests a TG reduction in the evinacumab-treated groups, although the overall TG 
levels in the evinacumab-treated animals are not much different from the TG levels determined prior to 
treatment. The applicant clarified that in the baseline TG values in hyperlipidemic db/db mice were 
typically 200 - 230 mg/dl and that the baseline TG values determined in study REGN1500-MX-12022 
were exceptionally low. In additional experiments in db/db mice, described in the Applicant's response, 
pre-bleed baseline values of TG in db/db mice were as expected. In these studies, evinacumab 
administered at 10 mg/kg SC either as single dose or repeated weekly doses led to a reduction of 
circulating TG of approximately 50% compared to control. These data confirm the TG reducing effect of 
evinacumab in hyperlipidemic db/db mice. Finally, it is noted that in study R1500-PH-19183 blood was 
collected from non-fasted mice, while in the previous studies, blood samples were generally collected 
after a 4-h fast. The Applicant clarified that in general the expression of ANGPTL3 is only minimally 
influenced by fasting or refeeding, and that levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C were not affected by 
fasting. Since study R1500-PH-19183 evaluated the effect of evinacumab on reduction of LDL-C, 
fasting was not warranted. In the previous studies, mice had been fasted to reduce the variability in 
TG levels while fasting per se had no effect on evinacumab efficacy in reducing levels of TG, cholesterol 
and LDL-C. 
Generally, evinacumab lowered serum lipids by inhibiting ANGPTL3 and promoting very-low-density 
lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation. To add to this, recent 
literature describes ANGPTL8 as an additional angiopoietin-like protein involved in lipid metabolism 
[Zhang et al., 2014]. Together with ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, ANGPTL8 can regulate TG metabolism by 
inhibiting the activity of LPL [Fu et al., 2015; Quagliarini et al., 2012]. While ANGPTL8 is an atypical 
ANGPTL family member (due to the lack of the C-terminal domain), it maintains the N-terminal domain 
required for interaction with lipases. Thus, ANGPTL8 is a potential target for evinacumab. However, 
evinacumab did not bind to ANGPTL8 while it bound to its target ANGPTL3. Thus, the data show a lack 
of evinacumab reactivity with ANGPTL8.  
The ability of evinacumab alone to reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaques has been 
demonstrated in a relevant model of disease, but without reducing other relevant markers. In this 
animal model of atherosclerosis, combination treatment with approved lipid-lowering therapies blocked 
disease progression when given as a double combination or reversed it when given as a triple 
combination. The reduction of cardiovascular risk in the patient population at large should nevertheless 
be demonstrated clinically. 
Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics were assessed in rats and monkeys and in the reproduction 
toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. The assay was not validated for rabbit serum. In all species, the 
presence of anti-drug-antibodies (ADA’s) was detected. Based on the outcome of the ADA assay, 
several rats and monkeys (but not rabbits) have been excluded from NCA, for a better prediction of 
human PK. For calculation of the exposure margins, data from ADA-positive animals were not 
excluded. Drug tolerance level was generally exceeded at doses ≥30 mg/kg in all evaluated species, 
suggesting that the ADA response may be underestimated at these dose levels. However, 
concentration-time profiles suggest that the number of ADA-positive animals is limited and does not 
have a marked impact on exposure or safety assessment.   
Rats (up to 13 weeks) and monkeys (up to 26 weeks) have been used as non-clinical species in the 
toxicology studies. There were no toxicological effects due to treatment with evinacumab. Both species 
are relevant since evinacumab binds to the target in both species. Although in the rat studies no 
pharmacological effect on LDL or triglyceride levels was evident, there was in increase in ANGPTL3 
levels.  
Exposure margins were recalculated by the applicant taking into account the difference in duration of 
exposure in animals vs. humans. Exposure margins based on Cmax and adjusted AUC lie within the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 37/123 
 
 
 
same order of magnitude, e.g. for the chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus, the Cmax-based margin is 
10.3x and the AUC-based margin is 14.6x. For the repeat-dose toxicity studies, the recalculated AUC-
based exposure margins also lie approximately in the same order of magnitude as the initially provided 
margins based on cumulative AUC (14.6x vs. 18.1x for the cynomolgus 26-week study; 4.56x vs. 3.1x 
for the rat 13-week study). The exposure margins derived are considered adequate to support the 
proposed use of evinacumab at 15 mg/kg once every 4 weeks.  
Evinacumab was not well tolerated in the rabbits embryofetal development (EFD) studies. Treatment 
with evinacumab at doses below the MHRD resulted in a domed head, flexed hindlimbs and ventricular 
dilatation of the brain in both rabbit EFD studies, and cleft palate in one of the studies. Maternal 
toxicity was also present at the doses at which malformations were seen. The relevance of these 
findings for humans is unclear, due to the accompanying maternal toxicity, and the different lipid 
profile during pregnancy in rabbits compared to humans. Embryotoxicity has been identified as an 
important potential risk in the RMP, due to malformations seen in the rabbit EFD studies. Due to the 
severity of the disease and the importance of cholesterol in embryofoetal development, the  advice for 
use during pregnancy introduced in section 4.6 of the SmPC: “not recommended during pregnancy and 
in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit 
outweighs the potential risk”, is the most appropriate advice. In the male fertility study in rabbits, 
treatment-related microscopic findings were seen in the liver and the kidney. Non-adverse liver 
findings consisted of increased glycogen and minimal to moderate centrilobular vacuolation. Findings in 
the kidney of mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis were considered 
adverse as these were considered the cause for the moribund conditions in individual animals sacrificed 
due to an ADA-related inflammatory reaction. The attribution of adversity to the observed kidney 
findings in the present study is acknowledged. Nevertheless, the relevance for humans is unclear. 
Direct evidence, e.g. by immunohistochemistry, that ADA-containing immune complexes contribute to 
the pathology not was provided. Nevertheless, taking into account that 5 of the 6 animals that were 
euthanised early/died were ADA-positive and that the microscopic findings were primarily observed in 
ADA-positive animals, it is agreed that these findings are related to the anti-drug antibody response 
and not relevant for the human risk assessment. 
Finally, in both rabbit juvenile toxicity studies, several animals were found dead or were euthanised in 
extremis. The applicant did not consider the early deaths/euthanasia in extremis in juvenile rabbits as 
related to evinacumab. However, the cause of death remained undetermined for quite a number of 
cases. The applicant indicated that the CRO did not have a historical control database for juvenile 
rabbits. This is unfortunate; however, it is recognised that rabbits are not used routinely for toxicity 
studies in juvenile animals and that historical controls may not be available to the extent wished. 
Based on the fact that deaths were also observed in animals from the control group and based on the 
lack of adverse clinical finding or post-mortem histopathology, findings in surviving animals early 
deaths/euthanasia in juvenile rabbits were considered not related to evinacumab. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has adequately established the safety profile of evinacumab. No issues have been 
identified that would preclude a marketing authorisation from the nonclinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of evinacumab have been characterised in 8 clinical trials, which included 
healthy subjects with elevated lipid levels, patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH), patients with severe high triglycerides and patients with HoFH. The pharmacokinetics of 
evinacumab after single-dose and repeated dosages were investigated in both healthy subjects as 
patients with HoFH. In general, sparse samples were collected in patient studies, except for study 
R1500-CL-1331 in which a dense sampling scheme was employed. Additionally, population 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted to further 
characterise the clinical pharmacology of evinacumab. No in vitro permeability or drug-drug interaction 
studies have been conducted, because evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, no clinical 
drug-drug interaction, hepatic or renal impairment studies have been conducted.  
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods were developed for the determination of total evinacumab (i.e. free evinacumab 
+ complex between evinacumab: AngPTL3 (target)), total AngPTL3 (i.e. free AngPTL3 and complex 
between evinacumab: AngPTL3) and evaluating immunogenicity. Total evinacumab was quantified in 
human serum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples were diluted with a 
mild acidic buffer to dissociate soluble target-drug complexes present in the serum samples to allow 
detection of total evinacumab. Total AngPTL3 concentrations were also determined using an ELISA 
bioanalytical method. Further, a bridging immunoassay has been developed and validated for the 
detection of anti-evinacumab antibodies in human serum samples, and a competitive ligand binding 
immunoassay has been developed and validated for the detection of anti-evinacumab neutralizing 
antibodies in human serum. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Noncompartmental PK parameters following the first dosing were calculated for individual subjects 
using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 6.3 or higher, Certara, L.P.) and linear trapezoidal method. In 
general, descriptive analyses were used to analyse the data.  
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Population pharmacokinetic model 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted based on data of studies R1500-CL-1629, 
R1500-CL-1719, R1500-HV-1214, R1500-CL-1321, R1500-CL-1642 and R1500-CL-1331. The 
primary objectives of the population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) analyses were to: Estimate the 
population and individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of evinacumab, estimate variability in PK 
parameters of evinacumab and, explore and characterise clinically relevant covariates that influence 
the pharmacokinetics. Evaluated covariates were sex, age, race, baseline body weight, baseline BMI, 
baseline albumin, disease type, concomitant anti-PCSK9 treatment, baseline total AngPTL3, baseline 
triglycerides. 
A two-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination, implemented using a 
Michaelis-Menten equation, was determined as the most suitable structural model. An attempt to 
include target-mediated drug disposition, using either baseline triglycerides or baseline total AngPTL3, 
in the model was unsuccessful. Body weight was included in the model on central volume (power 
model: parameter estimate of 0.875) and on clearance (power model: assuming standard allometric 
scaling exponent fixed to a value of 0.75). Furthermore, disease state (healthy volunteer versus HoFH 
subjects) influenced Vmax and, also, baseline AngPTL3 influenced Vmax (power model). This final 
population pharmacokinetic model did not successfully converge using the IMPMAP estimation

algorithm. Therefore, the applicant re-estimated model parameters by setting CALPHA to 0.001 instead 
of the default value of 0.05.

Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model 
The objective of the population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis was to develop a model to 
quantify the concentration-response relationship of evinacumab on LDL-C reduction and to estimate 
the population and individual PD parameters. Data from three clinical studies (Phase II study R1500-
CL-1331 and Phase III studies: R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1719) in patients with HoFH was 
used for this analysis. Covariates that were evaluated were: Concomitant medication or other lipid 
lower therapy (LLT): anti-PCSK9 treatment (evinacumab or evolocumab), statin, lipid apheresis 
therapy and baseline concentrations of LDL-C, total AngPTL3, triglyceride. 
The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model development was performed using a 
sequential approach. Firstly, individual PK parameters from the population pharmacokinetic model 
were used to calculate the evinacumab concentrations matching to the time points needed for the 
development of the population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. Then, the population 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship was analysed with the predicted PK data and observed 
PD data.  
An indirect response model was used to link the evinacumab concentrations with LDL-C, via the 
inhibitory of production of response (LDL-C production). No baseline parameter was estimated, but 
baseline observations were used to initialise the LDL-C compartment. Interindividual variability was 
included in the model parameters for IC50 and Kin. The residual error was modelled using a combined 
error model. Using forward selection (ΔOFV decrease of 6.635 was used as criterium), race was

implemented on IMAX, baseline LDL on IC50 and baseline weight on IMAX. No covariates were 
removed during backward elimination (ΔOFV decrease of 10.8). 
Absorption  
Not applicable as evinacumab is administered as an intravenous injection.  
Distribution 
The distribution of evinacumab is primarily restricted to the vascular compartment. Based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume of distribution (V2) was 2.56 L, and the 
peripheral volume of distribution (V3) was 2.25 L for a typical subject of 74.1 kg, resulting in a total 
volume of distribution of approximately 4.8 L for a typical subject of 74.1 kg.  
Metabolism and Excretion 
As a monoclonal antibody, evinacumab is not expected to be eliminated by the kidney or metabolized 
in the liver. The large molecular size of evinacumab is expected to preclude elimination via the kidney, 
and metabolism of evinacumab is expected to be limited to proteolytic catabolism to small peptides 
and individual amino acids. As a result, no metabolism/excretion studies were performed for 
evinacumab. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that elimination of evinacumab is best described by 
parallel linear, concentration-independent clearance and nonlinear, concentration-dependent, target-
mediated clearance. The terminal elimination phase is described by target-mediated clearance leading 
to pronounced non-linear kinetics. As such, the half-life (t½) is not constant, and thus its estimation is 
dependent on the dosing regimen, and elapsed time after dosing, the specific concentration of 
evinacumab and free AngPTL3 at that timepoint. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of evinacumab was evaluated in healthy volunteers after single-dose IV 
administration (study R1500-CL-1214, Figure 3). At baseline, the concentrations of total AngPTL3 were 
comparable across treatment arms, with mean values clustered around 0.1 mg/L. An increase in 
exposure to evinacumab with increasing doses was greater than dose-proportional. Following a single 
IV dose of evinacumab, an increase of approximately 7.1-fold in AUC0-last was observed with a 4-fold 
increase in dose from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. For patients with HoFH, only slightly greater than dose-
proportional increases in exposure were predicted using the population pharmacokinetic model. 
Predicted exposure showed a 4.3-fold increase in mean steady-state AUC0-tau with a 3-fold increase in 
dose from 5 mg/kg IV to 15 mg/kg IV.

Figure 4. Mean (±SE) Log-Scaled Concentrations of Total evinacumab in Serum vs nominal 
time (Study R1500-CL-1214, Group A)  
The accumulation ratio based on the observed Ctrough at week 4 versus week 24 after 15 mg/kg IV 
evinacumab in patients with HoFH was 2.9 (Study R1500-CL-1629). Steady-state is anticipated to be 
reached after approximately 12 to 16 weeks. The accumulation ratio based on predictions of AUC0-tau 
using the population pharmacokinetic model was approximately 2.0.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, inter-individual variability in Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and 
AUC0-Tau was estimated to be 22.2%, 38.4% and 29.7% following 15 mg/kg evinacumab. No intra-
individual variability was estimated for these summary statistics.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The pharmacokinetics of evinacumab were evaluated in two phase III studies (R1500-CL-1629, 
R1500-CL-1719) that used a sparse sampling scheme. The population pharmacokinetic analysis 
revealed that the Vmax of the non-linear clearance pathway differed between healthy subjects and 
patients with HoFH, with the estimated Vmax being 34% lower in patients. However, at a dose of 15 
mg/kg IV Q4W, this difference is expected to have a minimal impact on the exposure of evinacumab, 
since the drug concentrations within the 4-week dosing interval are expected to be in a range where 
linear clearance dominates and the contribution of target-mediated drug disposition is minor. 
Special populations 
The impact of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of evinacumab has mainly been evaluated using the 
population pharmacokinetic model (Table 3). The influence of gender, age, race, body weight, body 
mass index, hepatic function (baseline albumin), disease type, concomitant anti-PCSK9 treatment,

baseline AngPTL3 and baseline triglycerides were evaluated in this analysis. Post-hoc estimates of 
AUC0-tau, Cmax, Ctrough were presented for patients with extreme values of baseline covariates at 
baseline.  
Table 3. Summary (Mean ± SD) of individual post-hoc estimates of exposure at steady state, 
stratified by categorised covariates. 
Data from phase 3 studies in patients with HoFH showed that apheresis did not reduce concentrations 
of evinacumab by a clinically meaningful extent, with mean reductions of approximately 20% in post-
apheresis serum concentrations compared with pre-apheresis concentrations (R1500-CL-1629 and 
R1500-CL-1719). Notably, the effect of apheresis on the concentrations of total AngPTL3 was 
greater, approximately 50% in reducing the total target concentrations in serum. 
Trough concentrations at week 24 in study R1500-CL-1629 showed no clear difference between HoFH 
patients taking or not taking high-intensity statins. Similar results were observed for patients taking or 
not taking PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies (e.g., alirocumab or evolocumab). Consistently, PopPK analysis 
did not identify concomitant PCSK9 inhibitor therapy as a significant covariate on PK of evinacumab. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-drug antibodies were measured in all clinical studies. None of the patients treated with 
evinacumab exhibited treatment-emergent ADA responses in phase 1 clinical studies. None of the 
patients treated with evinacumab exhibited treatment-emergent ADA responses in either R1500-CL-
1629 or R1500-CL-1719. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (Study R1500-HTG-1522), one 
patient receiving evinacumab during the double-blind treatment period had a low-titer treatment-
emergent ADA response that was negative in the NAb assay; there was no impact on the PK and 
efficacy of evinacumab in the patient.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro, in silico or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. The effects of 
concomitant medication have been explored in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
At steady-state, the mean Cmax and AUC0-tau were estimated to be 690 (± 157) mg/L and 10286 (± 
3138) mg*day/L, following a 15 mg/kg dose.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to and inhibits 
ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family that is expressed primarily in 
the liver and plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and 
endothelial lipase (EL). 
Evinacumab blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TG and HDL-C by releasing LPL and EL activities from 
ANGPTL3 inhibition, respectively. Evinacumab reduces LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL 
receptor (LDLR) by promoting very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and VLDL remnants 
clearance upstream of LDL formation through EL-dependent mechanism.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of evinacumab have been studied in 8 clinical studies: three phase 1 
studies in healthy subjects with elevated lipid levels, one phase 2 study in patients with HoFH, one 
phase 2 study in patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia, including patients with HeFH 
(refractory hypercholesterolemia), one phase 2 study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia 
(SHTG) at risk for acute pancreatitis, and two phase 3 studies in patients with HoFH. 
Pharmacodynamic data were collected as follows: 
• 
Total ANGPTL3 (Target): Systemic concentrations of total ANGPTL3 were assessed in all studies 
as a marker for target engagement.  
In the bioanalysis total AngPTL3 was measured. This means that all AngPTL3 being measured consists 
of “free” AngPTL3 and AngPTL3 complexes with evinacumab. This indicates target binding, because the 
concentration of AngPTL3 increases and the AngPTL3-evinacumab complex is most likely broken down 
less quickly than AngPTL3. So a rise in “total” AngPTL3 doesn’t indicate the actual rise in ANGPTL3 
activity as the AngPTL3-evinacumab complex has no more AngPTL3 activity. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments included the evaluation of lipid parameters.  
• 
Triglycerides (Pharmacodynamic Marker): Reduction in TG levels is a direct, rapid PD response 
to the inhibitory effect of evinacumab on ANGPTL3.

Page 48/123 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Analysis of Efficacy (LDL-C) as a Pharmacodynamic Endpoint: The relationship between 
evinacumab concentration and its effect on LDL-C lowering was assessed through descriptive 
analyses and by PopPK/PD modelling. 
Single dose 
A single dose study Phase 1 in 99 healthy subjects (R1500-HV-1214) showed that following SC or IV 
injection of evinacumab, dose-dependent increases in total ANGPTL3 concentrations were observed. 
This indicates target binding. Mean maximal concentrations increased from 0.11 mg/L to 0.56 mg/L, as 
dose increased from 75 mg SC to 20 mg/kg IV. In general, the maximum concentration was reached 
before day 4, 72 hours following either IV or SC administration. Subsequently, concentrations of total 
ANGPTL3 declined, coinciding with the declining evinacumab concentrations. A plateau of total 
ANGPTL3 concentration curve was not clearly observed, indicating the absence of target saturation 
with meaningful duration at the highest dose tested, 20 mg/kg.

SC and IV doses of evinacumab induced reductions in TG, VLDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-
C, ApoA1, and ApoB. The reductions were dose-dependent. The highest reductions were seen with 10 
and 20 mg/kg IV. For LDL-C, the peak reduction in LDL-C occurred approximately between day 11 and 
day 15 (see figure below). For HDL-C, approximately at day 15 (see figure below).

Multiple ascending dose 
Study R1500-CL-1321 was a multiple ascending dose, phase 1 study, conducted in 52 healthy 
subjects with elevated TGs (150 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL) and LDL-C (≥ 100 mg/dL), evaluating the 
safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and PD effects of evinacumab administered IV and SC. 
Greatest reductions of more than 40% in LDL-C was observed at 20 mg/kg IV as compared to other SC 
doses (up to -30%). 
Studies with the proposed 15 mg/kg dose 
Two studies with the proposed 15 mg/g dose were performed. In a repeated-dose phase 1 race study 
comparing Japanese with Caucasian patient with elevated LDL-C (n=72) (study R1500-CL-1642), a 
dose-dependent increase in ANGPTL3 and accompanied reductions in LDL-C, including IV doses of 5 
mg/kg and 15 mg/kg (also some SC doses were evaluated) was shown after 28 weeks. Further, an

(HeFH, or non-HeFH with a history of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]; study

reduction in LDL-C (15 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and placebo) during 24 weeks of treatment.

Study R1500-CL-1331 was an open-label, single-arm proof-of-concept study with nine patients with 
HoFH with background therapy of lipid-modifying therapies, including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, 
and evolocumab, but excluding apheresis.

Increases of ANGPTL3 to levels of approximately 0.15 to 0.6 mg/dL were seen from baseline levels of 
0-0.15 mg/dL after IV administration of 15 mg/kg. Reduction of ≥50% from baseline in LDL-C was 
seen in 7 patients, the remaining 2 (null/null) achieved a reduction of ≥25% in LDL-C.

in the OLE period: 300 mg SC QW x 4 doses at weeks 26, 27, 28, 29; 20 mg/kg IV x 1 dose at week 38; and 20 
mg/kg IV Q12W starting at week 58. All patients completed the first two treatment regimens (evinacumab 300 mg 
SC QW x 4 doses at  weeks 26, 27, 28, 29; evinacumab 20 mg/kg IV x 1 dose at week 38 ) and most patients 
transitioned into the phase 3 open-label study, R1500-CL-1719, during the third treatment regimen, evinacumab 20 
mg/kg IV Q12W starting at week 58. 
Study reports from clinical trials in intended populations suggest that LDL-R mutation status does not 
affect reductions in LDL-C significantly. 
Due to the different mechanism of action of evinacumab, direct PD interactions with common lipid-
lowering agents are not expected. This assumption is supported by population PK/PD analysis, where 
concomitant therapies were not found to be covariates. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods  
All method validation studies (total evinacumab, total AngPTL3, anti-drug antibodies and neutralising 
antibodies) have not been performed under good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations. Nonetheless, 
the bioanalytical methods appear to have been appropriately validated, and method validation is in line 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 53/123 
 
 
 
 
 
with the Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 
2**).  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard pharmacokinetic methods were used to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
evinacumab. In general, the population pharmacokinetic model has been used to determine 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Population pharmacokinetic model 
The applicant developed a bioanalytical method that measures total AngPTL3 (free AngPTL3 + complex 
of AngPTL3 and evinacumab). Therefore, baseline AngPTL3 is assumed to be a reflection of free 
circulating AngPTL3 without any presence of evinacumab; however, it should be noted that it is 
uncertain whether it is an adequate reflection of the amount of free AngPTL3 in the presence of 
evinacumab. The mechanism of action is to neutralise free AngPTL3, which results in the formation of 
an AngPTL3-evinacumab complex. Therefore, evinacumab concentrations during a treatment period 
should be able to neutralise all newly formed AngPTL3 per dosing interval. The applicant did not 
measure the amount of free evinacumab.  
An attempt to fit a more mechanistic model (i.e. target-mediated drug disposition model using baseline 
triglycerides or baseline AngPTL3) was not successful. It is unclear how the imputation method for 
missing data in AngPTL3 affected this result, but this could also be due to the fact that total 
evinacumab was assumed to be the driver for the response (i.e. free evinacumab + complex of 
AngPTL3 and evinacumab), whereas, in theory, only free evinacumab can neutralise free AngPTL3. The 
applicant did not account for the fact that total evinacumab concentrations are being measured instead 
of free evinacumab concentrations. This results in an underestimation of the non-linear clearance 
pathway of evinacumab. The pharmacokinetics of the free evinacumab and the complex between 
evinacumab and AngPTL3 can be substantially different, which biases the results. As a result, the 
submitted population pharmacokinetic model is insensitive for the fluctuation in evinacumab clearance 
over time as the model does not account for any fluctuations in AngPTL3 concentrations over time. 
Thus, this model is not suitable for dosing recommendations or any future extrapolations. The 
applicant is advised in future applications to measure both free evinacumab and total evinacumab in 
study samples or fit adequate models that account for the target-mediated drug disposition in the case 
when only total concentrations are available.  
The model can, however, be used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters of total evinacumab 
concentrations and explain variability in the total evinacumab concentrations over time in the dataset it 
was built on as long as it is noted that the model does not account for variability over time caused by 
fluctuations in AngPTL3. The effect of this covariate is for the above-mentioned reasons most likely 
underestimated. Furthermore, the fact that both disease state and AngPTL3 affected non-linear 
elimination of total evinacumab could indicate that the AngPTL3 concentration (and also the fluctuation 
over time) is different between healthy volunteers and patients with HoFH, which could explain a 
different pharmacokinetic behaviour in patients as compared to healthy volunteers. The applicant has 
provided interpretable prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. These plots indicate that the 
model adequately predicts total concentrations of evinacumab for a typical patient included in study 
1629.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 54/123 
 
 
 
 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model 
Free evinacumab neutralises serum AngPTL3, which is supposed to reduce LDL-C and triglyceride 
concentrations. Therefore, if all AngPTL3 is neutralised by evinacumab, a maximum reduction in LDL-C 
or triglycerides should also be achieved. The current indirect response model, however, assumes that 
the concentration of total evinacumab, which is measured as the combination of free evinacumab and 
the complex between AngPTL3 and evinacumab, is directly linked to LDL-C response. As a result, by 
increasing the total evinacumab concentration, even if no free AngPTL3 is present, the model assumes 
that an additional effect can be achieved. The model results and, in particular, the simulations should 
therefore be interpreted with caution and should not be used to support dosing recommendations.  
Absorption 
Not applicable as evinacumab is administered as an intravenous injection.  
Distribution  
It should be noted that the estimates of the volume of distribution are based on a typical subject of 
74.1 kg. Weight was a covariate on the model parameter representing the volume of distribution in the 
central compartment. Therefore, patients with higher body weight are anticipated to have a higher 
volume of distribution and vice versa. Furthermore, these estimates are based on total evinacumab 
concentrations (i.e. free evinacumab + complex between evinacumab and AngPTL3). Therefore, these 
estimates provide a rough approximation of the approximate volume of distribution of free 
evinacumab.  
Metabolism and Excretion 
Evinacumab concentration-time profiles indicate both linear- and non-linear elimination pathways, of 
which the non-linear process could be explained by target-mediated elimination. This is likely as 
evinacumab neutralises soluble AngPTL3, which is a saturable process (i.e. evinacumab 
pharmacokinetics are linear in a state where no soluble free AngPTL3 is present in the circulation). 
Further, the linear elimination process is expected to be caused by non-specific cleavage to small 
peptides. The applicant indicates that the half-life is not constant in the terminal elimination phase as 
this is dependent on the dosing regimen, elapsed time after dosing, and the specific concentration at 
that time point (and of course the concentration of free AngPTL3). In the state of complete 
neutralisation of AngPTL3 and assuming the production of AngPTL3 is constant, half-life will be 
predictable and relatively constant at steady state. 
Dose proportionality 
The pharmacokinetics of evinacumab display target-mediated drug disposition pharmacokinetics. This 
implies that, if all AngPTL3 in the serum is neutralised, the pharmacokinetics become dose- 
proportional. For evinacumab, this translates in dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with higher 
dosages. Nonetheless, these estimates will need to be interpreted with caution as these are based on 
the total evinacumab concentration (i.e. free evinacumab + complex between evinacumab and 
AngPTL3) present in the serum.    
Time dependency 
It is anticipated that free evinacumab is more abundantly present in the systemic circulation compared 
to the complex between evinacumab and AngPTL3 as the amount of evinacumab administered with the 
15 mg/kg dose exceeds the saturable non-linear elimination process over time, in particular at steady 
state. The complex between evinacumab and AngPTL3 could, however, be subject to extensive 
accumulation. The applicant is asked to discuss the potential for accumulation of the complex between 
evinacumab and AngPTL3 and, if applicable, the clinical consequences.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The between-subject variability in Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUC0-Tau of total evinacumab varies between 22 – 
38%, which was estimated using the population pharmacokinetic model. The variability appears to be 
increased after repeated administration. No intra-individual variability was estimated for the summary 
statistics. However, based on the population pharmacokinetic model, after accounting for several 
covariates, the proportional error was estimated to have a coefficient of variation of approximately 
19% (although some questions have been raised about the adequacy of the population 
pharmacokinetic model). The additive error was minimal 0.3 mg/L. Therefore, it can be expected that 
the intra-subject variability of evinacumab is in general minimal. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Both disease state and baseline AngPTL3 affected the non-linear clearance of total evinacumab in the 
population pharmacokinetic model. The different non-linear clearance is expected to be a result of 
differences in AngPTL3 concentrations (both at baseline and over time) between healthy subjects and 
patients with HoFH. Therefore, any difference in the pharmacokinetics of evinacumab between healthy 
subjects and patients with HoFH is expected to be a result of differences in AngPTL3 concentrations 
over time and possible body weight differences. 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics in special populations have been sufficiently characterised. Mainly body weight 
and AngPTL3 concentrations influence the pharmacokinetics of evinacumab. The influence of body 
weight has been accounted for by the body weight-based dosing regimen. Nonetheless, the 
implementation of allometric scaling in the current population pharmacokinetic model is questionable 
and additional analyses are requested. Furthermore, the influence of AngPTL3 was quantified using the 
population pharmacokinetic model. It should be emphasized that total AngPTL3 (i.e. free and bound) 
and total evinacumab (i.e. free and bound) have been measured in the bioanalytical method. The 
pharmacokinetics of free and bound evinacumab can be substantially different, and as a relatively high 
dose of evinacumab has been administered, the effect of AngPTL3 on the pharmacokinetics of free 
evinacumab could have been underestimated. The AngPTL3 concentration is age-independent.   
Apheresis did not influence the pharmacokinetics of total evinacumab. It should, however, be noted 
that apheresis did influence the concentrations of total AngPTL3, which would reduce the non-linear 
target-mediated drug disposition of evinacumab. The linear elimination pathway is expected to 
dominate due to the high dose of evinacumab administered; therefore, the reduction of the non-linear 
clearance of evinacumab is most likely not clinically relevant. In addition, the fact that total AngPTL3 is 
reduced after apheresis could suggest that the complex between evinacumab and AngPTL3 is removed 
during apheresis. However, it would be expected that this is also reflected in the total evinacumab 
concentration. The applicant is asked to comment on this. 
Immunogenicity 
The probability of developing anti-drug antibodies for evinacumab appears to be minimal. One patient 
demonstrated a low-titer treatment-emergent ADA, but the neutralising antibody assay was negative, 
and the applicant stated that no influence on the pharmacokinetics or efficacy was observed.  
Interactions 
No drug-drug interactions are to be expected for evinacumab as evinacumab is not metabolised by 
specific enzymes. The only interactions that can be expected are drugs that influence the amount of 
circulating AngPTL3. Nonetheless, the influence of these interactions is expected to be low as the 
amount of free evinacumab is more abundantly present at steady state than the amount of bound 
evinacumab. This is in line with the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 56/123 
 
 
 
demonstrated that the influence of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors was minimal as no clear difference in 
the pharmacokinetics of total evinacumab was observed.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation  
The steady-state exposures have been estimated with the population pharmacokinetic model. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Evinacumab has a proposed new mechanism. It is a human monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-
like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting 
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). This would lead to a reduction in LDL-C; 
independent of the presence of an LDL receptor, by promoting very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 
processing and clearance, thereby reducing the VLDL pool available to generate LDL. Although the 
mechanism is not completely understood, based on more recent studies, it is hypothesized that 
especially endothelial lipase (EL) rather than LPL plays a more crucial role in the reduction of LDL-C via 
VLDL processing. Further, it is not known how evinacumab influences HDL-C function as a consequence 
of lowering of HDL-C and alteration of the homeostasis of other lipid parameters, especially in the 
setting of extremely elevated LDL-C levels as presented by the HoFH phenotype. Any potential for liver 
fat accumulation seems unlikely, as studies suggest no role of evinacumab in the VLDL processing in 
the liver. 
TG and LDL-C were the main lipid parameters used to assess evinacumab’s pharmacodynamics. Total 
ANGPTL3 was used as target engagement marker. 
A single dose study demonstrates comparable ANGPTL3 concentrations and an approximately similar 
reduction in LDL-C with a 5 and 10 mg/kg dose and higher levels of ANGPTL3 and a slightly further 
reduction in LDL-C with a 20 mg/kg dose. Multiple-dose studies in different type of patients, including 
patients with elevated LDL-C levels, demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in ANGPTL3 
concentrations for 5 and 15 mg/kg iv doses within 72 hours of initiating treatment. The onset of 
ANGPTL3 increase was within 72 hours of initiating therapy with a lagged effect on LDL-C (maximum 
effect at 11 to 15 days). Further, a reduction in HDL-C was observed. Generally, this provides some 
support for the proof of concept, although the exact mechanism is not exactly clear (see discussion 
above). Several studies have investigated the proposed 15 mg/kg dose, including the proof of concept 
study in 9 HoFH patients. Based on the results as discussed, the 15 mg/kg dose would be the 
appropriate dose to be further investigated in the clinical program. Any increased effect of the 20 
mg/kg is too minimal in comparison to the 15 mg/kg dose.  
As for genetic differences on PD, study reports from clinical trials in the intended population (HoFH) 
suggest that mutation status does not affect reductions in LDL-C significantly (see efficacy section).   
Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies such as statins, PCSK-9 inhibitors and apheresis did not affect the 
pharmacodynamics of evinacumab (see efficacy section). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of evinacumab, a recombinant human immunoglobulin-4 (IgG4) monoclonal 
antibody, have been sufficiently characterised throughout the presented clinical development 
programme. The recommended dose of evinacumab is 15 mg/kg administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 60 minutes every 4 weeks. With this relatively high dose, evinacumab displays dose-
proportional pharmacokinetics at steady state. Evinacumab displays both linear and non-linear 
elimination, but at high evinacumab concentrations, the non-linear elimination pathway becomes 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 57/123 
 
 
 
saturated. The non-linear elimination represents the target-mediated drug disposition, which is caused 
by the neutralisation of the target (i.e. angiopoietin-like protein 3 (AngPTL3)). Consequently, free 
AngPTL3 is the predominant factor influencing the pharmacokinetic profile of evinacumab. Upon 
complete neutralisation of free AngPTL3, the pharmacokinetics become linear. This is the case with the 
relatively high 15 mg/kg dose of evinacumab, which is sufficient to completely neutralise all AngPTL3 
that is formed during the 4-week interval, which is derived from the absence of non-linear 
pharmacokinetic behaviour at steady state over the 4 weekly intervals. The applicant is however 
advised to study the free fractions of both evinacumab and AngPTL3 in combination with the total 
concentrations of both evinacumab and AngPTL3 in future clinical trials. It is anticipated that a lower 
dose could achieve similar results but would substantially reduce the burden for patients (e.g. shorter 
infusion times or less frequent dosing) and could be relevant for the SC formulation which 
demonstrates more non-linear pharmacokinetic behaviour. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The conducted phase 1 and 2 studies provide evidence for the general proof of concept of target 
engagement of ANGPTL3 with an associated lagged reduction in LDL-C levels. Although efforts have 
been made to demonstrate the mechanism of action, this is not fully understood especially in the HoFH 
setting with extremely elevated LDL-C levels. 
In conclusion the application was considered approvable from clinical pharmacology point of view.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The submission of evinacumab efficacy in HoFH consists of one pivotal phase 3 study (R1500-CL-1629) 
including a double-blind and an open-label part, and two supportive studies (R1500-CL-1331, a phase 
2 proof-of-concept study and R1500-CL-1719, an ongoing phase 3 open-label extension study).  
The pivotal phase 3 study (R1500-CL-1629) is described under Main study below, the ongoing R1500-

2.5.2.  Main study 
Title of study 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Evinacumab in Patients with Homozygous Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia (ELIPSE-HoFH) 
Methods 
This study consisted of the following: up to 8-week run-in period (for patients who required 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HoFH] genotyping, for patients whose background medical 
lipid-modifying therapy [LMT] was not stable prior to screening or whose apheresis settings and/or 
schedule were not stable for at least 8 weeks prior to screening), a 2-week screening period, a 24-
week double-blind treatment period (DBTP), a 24-week OLTP (open-label phase), and a 24-week 
follow-up period after the last dose of study drug for patients not entering an optional long-term, 
open-label study, R1500-CL-1719. 
Randomization was stratified by apheresis treatment status (Yes, No) and region (Japan, Rest of 
World).  
The efficacy of evinacumab was assessed by clinical laboratory evaluation of lipid levels at pre-
specified time points throughout the study. Overall safety was assessed by monitoring and evaluation 
of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
clinical safety laboratory tests at pre-specified time points. The potential emergence of anti-
evinacumab antibodies was also evaluated. 
Study Participants 
The study planned to randomize approximately 57 patients at 30 multinational sites in 11 countries in 
Europe, Asia, North America, and Australia. Randomization was stratified by region (Japan, Rest of the 
World [ROW]) to ensure an appropriate balance in treatment assignment for the Japanese patients.  
Key inclusion criteria 
The study population consisted of patients with HoFH receiving stable LMT. HoFH was diagnosed by 
either genetic or clinical criteria: 
 Genetic criteria 
1.  Documented functional mutation or mutations in both LDLR alleles (Note: patients who have 
null receptor mutations on both LDLR alleles, i.e., double null, are eligible),  
OR 
2.  Presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in Apo B or PCSK9 (Note: 
patients who are double heterozygous, i.e., mutations on different genes (e.g., LDLR/PCSK9) 
and patients with homozygous LDLRAP1 mutations are eligible) 
Clinical criteria 
Untreated TC > 500 mg/dL (12.93 mmol/L) and TG <300 mg/dL (3.39 mmol/L),  
AND 
Assessment report

Page 60/123 
 
 
 
Both parents with documented TC > 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol) or cutaneous or tendinous 
xanthoma before the age of 10 years 
Lipid modifying therapies could include maximally tolerated daily statin, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor 
antibody or other lipid-lowering therapies, including lipoprotein apheresis. Subjects were expected to 
be on background LLT, including apheresis but were excluded when their LDL-C level was <70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L) at screening.  
Subjects were to be >12 years of age or >18 years of age, depending on the applicable regulations per 
country.  
Key exclusion criteria 
Exclusion criteria designed to prevent confounding of efficacy results included background LLT, 
including apheresis, not stable for a sufficient period prior to screening, as well as the presence of any 
clinically significant uncontrolled endocrine disease known to influence serum lipids or lipoproteins.  
Further, no pregnancies should occur on treatment, and highly effective birth control methods were 
mandatory, for men and women due to possible negative effects on the fetus seen in non-clinical 
studies.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) or matching placebo IV Q4W starting on day 1. During the 24-week double-blind treatment 
phase, patients received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) or matching placebo IV Q4W. 
During the 24-week open-label treatment phase, all patients received open-label evinacumab 15 
mg/kg IV Q4W. The last dose of double-blind study drug was administered at week 20. After 
completion of the DBTP, all patients entered a 24-week OLTP to receive open-label evinacumab 15 
mg/kg IV Q4W.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include assessments of other atherogenic lipoproteins or lipid 
parameters associated with an elevated risk of ASCVD (ApoB, TC, non-HDL-C, TG, and ApoB/ApoA1 
ratio), the proportion of patients reaching predefined LDL-C targets, or proportion of patients meeting 
certain apheresis eligibility criteria (see also table above).  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Evinacumab IV (Q4W) or matching placebo IV Q4W for the 24-week double-blind treatment period 
(DBTP). The randomization was stratified by apheresis treatment (Yes, No) and by region (Japan, Rest 
of World).  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel were to remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the DBTP (up to week 24). Lipid results from blood samples 
collected after the randomization visit were not communicated to the sites, and the sponsor’s 
operational team did not have access to these laboratory results until after completion of the DBTP and 
the first-step analysis. Although there is a slight colour difference between the drug product and 
placebo product for IV infusion bag preparation, the colour difference was not detectable when the 
investigational product is added to the IV infusion bag. Treatment assignment was not to be provided 
to site personnel, other than the unblinded study pharmacist, at any time during the conduct of the 
study, except in the case of a true emergency.

Statistical methods 
The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose or part of a 
dose of double-blind study drug. The modified ITT (mITT) population is defined as the all randomized 
population who took at least 1 dose or part of a dose of study drug and had an evaluable primary 
endpoint. The ITT and mITT population will be analyzed as randomized. The double-blind safety 
analysis set (SAF) considered for safety analyses will be the randomized population who received at 
least 1 dose or part of a dose of double-blind study drug and will be analyzed according to the 
treatment received. 
The double-blind primary efficacy analysis will compare the evinacumab treatment group to placebo at 
week 24. The percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C will be analyzed in the ITT population 
using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available 
within week 2 to week 24 analysis windows will be used, and missing data are accounted for by the 
MMRM model. The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group, randomization 
strata and region, time point, strata-by-time point interaction, and treatment by time point interaction, 
as well as, the continuous fixed covariates of baseline calculated LDL-C value and baseline value-by-
time point interaction. The statistical testing of the comparison for the primary measure will be 
evaluated at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. This model will be run with an unstructured 
correlation matrix to model the within-patient errors. 
Robustness of the primary analysis statistical methods will be assessed through sensitivity analyses, 
including an on-treatment analysis using the mITT population, and a pattern mixture model (PMM) will 
be employed to assess the potential violation of the missing at random assumption. 
Continuous secondary variables anticipated to have a normal distribution (i.e., lipids other than TG and 
Lp[a]) will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint. Continuous 
secondary efficacy endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal distribution (i.e., TG and Lp[a]), will be 
analyzed using a robust regression model. Binary secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using 
stratified logistic regression with treatment group and randomization stratum as a main effect and 
corresponding baseline value(s) as a covariate. Missing values will be addressed using a multiple 
imputation approach. In order to address multiple key secondary efficacy endpoints, the overall type-I 
error will be controlled by the use of a hierarchical inferential approach. Inferential conclusions about 
key secondary parameters require statistical significance of the prior parameter within the hierarchy. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Double-blind treatment period 
Of the 75 patients who were assessed for eligibility, ten patients were excluded: eight did not meet the 
inclusion criteria, and two refused to participate. In total, 65 patients were randomized (22 patients to 
placebo and 43 patients to evinacumab). A total of 64 patients completed the 24-week DBTP. One 
patient from the placebo treatment group withdrew consent after receiving 1 dose of study drug and 
discontinued the study early. 
Open-label treatment period 
All 64 patients subsequently enrolled into the open-label part of the study, of which 62 patients 
completed the 24-week OLTP. One patient discontinued due to pregnancy (evinacumab). One patient 
(placebo) discontinued due to non-compliance with the protocol. This placebo patient (4.5%) had

incorrectly received evinacumab treatment at week 20, which was identified after the first DBL. 
Therefore, in the open-label treatment period, this subject was counted as former evinacumab.

Among the most common important deviations of “procedural irregularities”, the most common were 
“procedure performed outside of window”; specifically, apheresis procedure not performed per the 
patient schedule (10 evinacumab patients [23.3%]; 6 placebo patients [27.3%]), and LDL-C 
measurement taken after apheresis treatment (1 evinacumab patient [2.3%]; 2 placebo patients 
[9.1%]). Further, for patients in the evinacumab treatment group, 3 patients (7.0%) were being 
treated with background PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies whose regimens were not stable for at least 8 
weeks prior to screening, and 3 patients (7.0%) did not have their background medical LMT stable for 
at least 4 weeks before the screening visit (week -2). 
Recruitment 
In total, 22 patients (33.8%) were randomized and treated at sites located in European Union (EU) 
member countries (Austria, France, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands [13 females and 9 males; mean 
age: 33.3 years]) and 10 patients (15.4%) were randomized and treated at sites in Japan (5 females 
and 5 males; mean age 49.5 years). The remaining 33 randomized patients (50.7%) were from non-
EU member countries (Australia [4 patients, 6.2%], Canada [3 patients, 4.6%], South Africa [8 
patients, 12.3%], Ukraine [8 patients, 12.3%], and the United States [US] [10 patients, 15.4%]. 
First patient, first visit was 18 Jan 2018. Week 24 last patient/last visit for the double-blind treatment 
period was 10 Jun 2019 [DBTP]). The database lock date for the double-blind treatment period was 29 
Jul 2019.  
For the subsequent open-label extension the last patient/last visit was 26 Nov 2019. Database lock 
date for the analyses was 16 Jan 2020.

Conduct of the study 
Several protocol amendments were made during the study period. Some changes involved changing 
global protocol into country-specific versions (mainly adding or removing adolescents from the 
inclusion criteria), clarifications, or minor changes.  
From Amendment 4, as reflected in the exclusion criteria, no pregnancies should occur on treatment 
and highly effective birth control methods were mandatory, for men and women. This due to possible 
negative effects on the foetus seen in non-clinical studies. Women of childbearing potential should use 
effective contraception during treatment with evinacumab and for at least 5 months after the last dose 
of evinacumab.

Prior and Concomitant Medications/Procedures 
Lipid-Lowering Treatment 
At baseline, 93.8% of the total patients were on a statin, and 76.9% were on a high-intensity statin 
regimen. The main reason for patients not being on a high-intensity statin regimen was due to 
tolerability issues related to muscle symptoms. In addition to statins, the most frequently used LLT 
included PCSK9 inhibitors (50 patients [76.9%]), ezetimibe (49 patients [75.4%]), and apheresis (22 
patients [33.8%]). Fourteen patients were on lomitapide at baseline. 
Most patients were on at least 3 lipid-lowering therapies. The most common reason patients were not 
on ezetimibe was due to lack of access, and the most common reason patients were not on a PCSK9 
inhibitor was due to lack of efficacy.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results (LDL-C) 
Treatment with evinacumab resulted in a statistically significant decrease in percent change from 
baseline calculated LDL-C at week 24 with LS mean difference of -49.0% (95% CI: -65.0% to -33.1%) 
(-47.1% for evinacumab vs 1.9% for placebo). The absolute mean change in LDL-C was approximately 
-3.48 mmol/L.

Adolescent Subgroup Analyses 
Two adolescents, both null/null, were enrolled with 1 patient randomized to each treatment group. The 
baseline LDL-C was 10.39 mmol/L for the patient in the evinacumab treatment group and 3.63 mmol/L 
for the patient in the placebo group. The percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24 for the 
evinacumab-treated adolescent was -73.3%, with an associated absolute change in LDL-C 
of -7.62 mmol/L. There was a +60% change for the patient treated with placebo, with an associated 
absolute change in LDL-C of +2.17 mmol/L (reduction in LDL-C was seen in the open-label phase when 
treated with evinacumab, see further below). More data in adolescents (total 13) are available from 
the ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-1719 (see section supportive studies).

Open-Label efficacy (additional 24 weeks after pivotal double-blind study phase) 
In the overall open-label population (N=64), a mean (SD) absolute reduction of 3.479 mmol/L 
[3.0386]) in LDL-C was seen from baseline to week 48 with evinacumab treatment, corresponding to a 
46.3% reduction, which is in line with the reduction observed in the DBTP. 
Similar reductions in LDL-C were seen between patients converted from placebo to evinacumab during 
the OLTP (see figure below).

Of the 2 adolescent patients treated in the double-blind period, LDL-C reductions at week 48 were 
35.7% and 72.3% for the double-blind placebo patient and evinacumab patient, respectively. More 
data in adolescents (total 13) are available from the ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-1719 (see 
section supportive studies). 
HDL-C remained reduced with a 30% reduction at week 48 (reduction of 0.36 mmol/L). 
Effects on other lipid parameters were consistent with those observed in the double-blind phase.

Notes 
ITT estimand: patients in ITT population whose lipid values obtained within the 
week 24 analysis window were included in the analysis, regardless of adherence 
to treatment and subsequent therapies. 
Statistical model: the analysis used a mixed-effect model with repeated 
measures (MMRM) approach including the treatment group, randomization 
strata, timepoint, treatment-by-timepoint, and strata-by-timepoint interaction, 
as well as the continuous baseline calculated LDL-C value and baseline value-
by-timepoint interaction. This model also applies to other similar key secondary 
endpoints.

Notes 
A patient was considered to have met the EU Apheresis Eligibility Criteria if they 
fulfilled the criteria set forth by the German Apheresis Working Group 
(Thompson, 2010): treatment was required for primary CVD prevention and 
LDL-C was >160 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) or if treatment was required for 
secondary CVD prevention and LDL-C was >120 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L). 
* The estimate of odds ratio was obtained by combining the logarithm of odds 
ratio from logistic regression model analyses of datasets generated by the 
multiple imputation approach. 
 **Select key secondary efficacy endpoints are presented, the p-value is

The number of patients older than 65 years included in the clinical studies is limited (n=10). In study 
R1500-CL-1629 DBTP at week 24, the LDL-C change from baseline vs placebo was -53.6% in the <65 
years group (n=35) and -28.9% in the ≥65 years group (n=8, all evinacumab).  
Gender 
Evinacumab treatment resulted in a slightly higher reduction in LDL-C in female compared with male 
(-56.2% and -42.4%, respectively).   
Supportive study(ies) 
Phase 3 study R1500-CL-1719 (Phase 3, Open-Label, ongoing) 
Study R1500-CL-1719 is an ongoing open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 
evinacumab in patients ≥12 years of age and adults with HoFH, receiving maximally tolerated lipid-
modifying therapy (LMT), including lipoprotein apheresis. Overall (data cut-off date 28 Aug 2020), 117 
patients had been enrolled, 70 patients participated in previous evinacumab studies. 
Mean (SD) percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24 is -43.7% (SD 38; n=81). Reductions 
from baseline were observed at week 24 in other atherogenic lipid parameters, including a 37%, 46%, 
44% and 47% reductions in ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC, and TG. There was a 30% mean reduction in HDL-C 
from baseline to week 24. Decreases were similar between the New Evinacumab (-47.7% [23]) (n=45) 
and Continue Evinacumab (-41.7% [44]) (n=70) groups. 
At the time of the data cut-off date, 13 adolescents have been included (2 from the placebo-controlled 
study) with mean duration of treatment of 34.5 weeks ranging from 4 to 61 weeks with 11 patients 
treated for more than 24 weeks, and 3 more than 48 weeks. Week 24 data are available for 9 patients 
and demonstrate a reduction in LDL-C of -52.4% (SD 29). This was -67% for adolescents with the 
null/null variant(n=4) and -40.6% for the non-null/null variants (n=5). Secondary lipid parameters 
showed substantial reductions in ApoB (-49%), non-HDL-C (-55%), TC (-54%), TG (-52%), although 
also a reduction in HDL-C was observed (-41%) with an absolute change of 0.42 mmol/L. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main clinical program consists of a phase 3 placebo-controlled double-blind study including a 24-
week double-blind treatment period (evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) or matching 
placebo IV Q4W, randomised 2:1) and a 24-week open-label period on evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W 
in the targeted population of an intended 65 patients with HoFH. Further, a phase 2 study has been 
performed in the targeted population of 9 HoFH patients. A placebo-controlled 16-24 weeks study in 
patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (n=106) could provide further support for the evaluation of 
the lipid-lowering effect of evinacumab. Further support will be generated from an ongoing open-label 
study which included both treated and untreated evinacumab patients and intended treatment of up to 
4 years. Nevertheless, the clinical programme is currently very limited, especially with regards to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 83/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
target population included in the proposed indication but is reasonable considering the very low 
prevalence (and availability) of these types of patients. 
The proposed study population included in the pivotal study is considered appropriate. The HoFH 
diagnosis had to be genetically or clinically confirmed by specific criteria, which seems appropriate. 
Further, the population had to receive optimal lipid-lowering therapy (statin, ezetimibe, PCSK9 
inhibitor antibody or other lipid-lowering therapies, including apheresis). Inclusion of adolescent HoFH 
≥12 years of age is understood considering the high unmet medical need also present in children due 
to early aged onset of disease, the similarity in disease characteristics with adults and the weight-
based dosing as applied. The current study has also been included in the paediatric investigational plan 
(PIP), amongst other studies. 
It was stressed that no pregnancies should occur on treatment and highly effective birth control 
methods were mandatory, for men and women due to possible negative effects on the foetus seen in 
non-clinical studies.  
The primary endpoint of percent change LDL-C from baseline to week 24 was considered acceptable 
and sufficiently long to provide reliable, stable data on the evaluation of LDL-C reduction for 6 times 
administration of evinacumab. Key secondary endpoints evaluation of other lipid parameters (i.e., 
ApoB, non-HDL-C, and total cholesterol [TC]), the proportion of patients with ≥30% and ≥50% 
reduction in LDL-C, proportion of patients with LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L, and on eligibility criteria for 
apheresis, as well as additional endpoints, including e.g. HDL-C and TG, were considered appropriate 
to provide a decent understanding on the effects of evinacumab on the overall lipid profile. The open-
label extension period of 24 weeks could provide valuable information on the maintenance of effect 
over almost a year’s treatment period. With this clinical program, the assumed clinical benefit was 
based on the LDL-C surrogate which was considered acceptable, based on the existing unmet need for 
these patients and knowing that robust evaluation of any potential cardiovascular benefit with 
evinacumab seems difficult to achieve due to the rarity of the disease. Nevertheless, to address and 
confirm that the LDL-C reduction with evinacumab translates into CV benefit is considered valuable, in 
particular in the context of a new mechanism of action of evinacumab and available 
inconsistent/incomplete findings on atherosclerosis evaluation in non-clinical studies.  
The analysis populations and the primary and secondary analyses were considered acceptable. Missing 
data handling assuming random missingness is not preferred, however considering the small amount 
of missing data and suitable sensitivity analysis (e.g. PMM), this was not considered of concern. 
However, the primary analysis follows a treatment policy strategy, which is not entirely agreed. In the 
analysis, data is assumed to be missing at random, and this corresponds more with a hypothetical 
strategy. Again, as the amount of missing data is minimal, this was not further pursued, and the 
strategy was acceptable. In general, the defined estimand and sensitivity analysis were agreed. 
However, this would require that background treatment (LMT and apheresis) remains stable. Since this 
was not the case for all patients, this could have had an impact on the analysis. However, in a post-hoc 
analysis, the applicant showed this did result in a slightly lower treatment effect but did not change the 
conclusions. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Of the enrolled 65 patients, 43 patients were treated with evinacumab and 22 with placebo. All 
patients remained in the study during the placebo-controlled period and all patients, except one, 
completed the 48 treatment period.  
A sufficient representation of the EU setting was available with 22 patients (33.8%) included from the 
EU (Austria, France, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands). Patients were on appropriate background

therapy at the start of study inclusion; 94% were on statins, 73-76% on ezetimibe, 73-79% on PCSK9 
inhibitors, 14-26% on lomitapide, and 34% on apheresis. Baseline characteristics (also according to 
stratification factors) between the groups were fairly similar for this small study for baseline lipid 
parameters, type of HoFH diagnosis (clinical criteria or genotyping), CV history, and types of LLT. Mean 
baseline LDL-C level for the total study population was 6.6 mmol/L. Patients with null/null or 
negative/negative mutations had a higher mean baseline LDL-C, 8.1 mmol/L and 7.5 mmol/L, 
respectively. 
A substantial treatment effect was observed with evinacumab at week 24, as a significant difference in 
LDL-C between the evinacumab vs placebo of -49.0% (95% CI: -65.0% to -33.1%; mean difference 
from baseline of -47.1% vs 1.9%, respectively) was observed. This corresponds to a clinically relevant 
absolute mean change in LDL-C of -3.48 mmol/L, with an effect already starting at week 2. This 
corresponded to the results already obtained in the phase 2 study in 9 HoFH patients treated with the 
proposed 15 mg/kg dose. Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent and similar in magnitude 
to the primary efficacy analysis. The key secondary endpoint outcomes were in support of the primary 
endpoint with a significant lowering of all lipid parameters (TC -48.4%, ApoB -36.9%, non-HDL-
C -51.7%), except that HDL-C (-30%) was also reduced (see further below).  
Further, the lipid-lowering effect was maintained during the additional 24 weeks open-label treatment 
period with an approximately 50% reduction in LDL-C at week 48 for both evinacumab prolonged 
treatment patients, while former placebo patients confirmed the previous effect demonstrated in the 
double-blind phase. Moreover, the effect appeared consistent among several subgroups including 
genetic mutation variants, regardless of the type of background therapy, and amongst gender, region, 
and race subgroups.  
Moreover, similar results, although very limited, were obtained in adolescents (both null/null 
genotype). For the one treated with evinacumab LDL-C reduction at week 24 was -73.3%. For the one 
treated with placebo, this was +60%, however, at week 48 (treated for 24 weeks with evinacumab), 
the reduction was -35.7% from baseline for this patient. Of note, for the adolescent already treated 
with evinacumab, this was -72.32% at week 48. These data were reinforced by the availability of 
efficacy results of an additional 11 adolescents as included in the ongoing open-label study (with 2 
adolescents included in pivotal study this gives total of 13 adolescents) demonstrating comparable 
efficacy of -52% at week 24 for data as available for 9 patients. This is sufficient to consider this 
population as part of the target population. 
Further support for the LDL-C lowering effect comes from a study in adult patients with refractory 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or non-HeFH with a history of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease), in which treatment with evinacumab 15 mg/kg confirmed the results as obtained in HoFH 
patients with a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C at week 16 of -49.9% as compared to 
placebo. Further, a lower dose of evinacumab 5 mg/kg showed a much lower effect on LDL-C vs 
placebo (-23.5% at week 16). Further, support for longer-term efficacy data in HoFH patients beyond 
48 weeks of evinacumab treatment comes from the ongoing study R1500-CL-1719. Currently, data are 
available with a cut-off date of 28 Aug 2020, with 117 patients being enrolled. The study further 
confirmed the LDL-C lowering effect who continued evinacumab treatment with a maintained decrease 
in LDL-C of -43%.  
However, in the pivotal study (as well in other submitted studies), treatment with evinacumab resulted 
in a 30% reduction in HDL-C at week 24, with HDL-C reaching below normal levels of 0.799 mmol/L. 
This could likely be to the effect of evinacumab on the endothelial lipase (EL) responsible for the 
hydrolysis of HDL-C particles. However, the impact of this for reverse cholesterol transport, especially 
in the setting of this diseased population with extremely high elevated cholesterol, is somewhat 
uncertain. Further, the potential impact on cardiovascular risk remains unclear, especially since recent 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 85/123 
 
 
 
findings challenged a clear correlation between HDL-C targeted treatment (increase in HDL-C) and 
improvement in cardiovascular risk. The cardioprotective association with LOF variants in ANGPTL3 
may suggest that this may overall provide a cardiovascular protective effect with evinacumab. 
However, extrapolation to current findings may be complicated as the current diseased HoFH 
population substantially deviated from the LOF population based on the extremely elevated LDL 
cholesterol levels, and the loss of function in the LDL receptor. Overall, the lowering of HDL-C by 
evinacumab may likely not importantly offset the potential CV benefits from substantial lowering of 
LDL-C, although efforts should be made to better understand the CV impact of evinacumab treatment 
post-approval. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Due to the rarity of the HoFH population (~1 in 300,000 in the EU), it may be challenging if not 
unfeasible to provide comprehensive data of a robust confirmation on morbidity (CV benefit) and 
mortality. Anticipating that the level of evidence is considerably less than what would normally be 
required for a standard approval (with expected robust confirmatory data post-approval), a different 
regulatory approach was foreseen and needed to be followed. As comprehensive data on safety and 
efficacy of the product are not available, and the application meets the applicable requirements, a 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances was proposed by the CHMP during the 
assessment with the main reason that indications for which the product in question is intended are 
encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive 
evidence (see EMEA/357981/2005). 
Consequently, specific obligation was agreed and included in Annex IIE to form the basis for annual 
reassessment in the context of MA under exceptional circumstances. A non-interventional post-
authorisation safety study (PASS) was requested to be conducted to have some confirmatory 
understanding on the cardiovascular implications of treating these patients with evinacumab. This was 
felt important considering the not completely understood new mechanism of action of evinacumab also 
in relation to the limited understanding of the implications of the observed potential off target effect of 
HDL-C reduction.  
The following objectives were agreed for the PASS: to evaluate the long term safety outcomes (i.e., 
hospitalisations, death, and MACE) in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) 
who are ≥12 years old and treated with evinacumab, to evaluate the frequency and outcomes of 
pregnancy in female patients with HoFH treated with evinacumab and to evaluate the atherosclerosis 
process over time in patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo cardiac 
imaging. The MAH should conduct and submit the results of this study based on data from a registry in 
patients with HoFH. Patients included in the existing disease registry: European Atherosclerosis Society 
(EAS) FH Studies Collaboration (FHSC) Registry were agreed to be the source population for this study.  
Further, any evaluation of vascular damage by imaging of the atherosclerosis process will be of 
particular interest as a confirmation between LDL-C lowering surrogate effect and the proposed longer-
term monitoring for MACE events. 
The outline specifying the objectives and the design of the proposed PASS study were agreed within 
current procedure. The draft protocol will be submitted for assessment within 3 months after product 
approval, and annual study reports will follow within the annual reassessment.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, evinacumab 15 mg/kg 4QW demonstrated a substantial and consistent 
reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters on top of existing therapy options in a limited number of 
43 patients with HoFH, including one adolescent, compared to 22 placebo-treated patients. The 
ongoing long-term study provides data of maintenance of effect in the longer term. Data in adolescents 
are consistent with the overall data. There is some uncertainty on the effect of a lowering of HDL-C by 
evinacumab treatment. However, this does likely not offset the potential CV benefits from substantial 
lowering of LDL-C, although efforts should be made to better understand the CV impact of evinacumab 
treatment post-approval.  
To address this uncertainty related to efficacy aspect in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances, a PASS study including MACE as one of the endpoints and vascular damage by imaging 
of the atherosclerosis process through routine clinical practice data generation was agreed. The 
approval under exceptional circumstances was considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is displayed based on the following: 
• 
• 
the pivotal study in HoFH patients (R1500-CL-1629),  
a combined pool of placebo-controlled data including the pivotal study R1500-CL-1629 (a 
phase 3 study in HoFH patients) and a phase 2 study in patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia 
(R1500-CL-1643)), including data on placebo, the 15 mg/kg dose and the 5 mg/kg dose. 
• 
and an open-label pool including safety data of the 15 mg/kg dose as used in HoFH patients 
from the extension phase of the pivotal study R1500-CL-1629 and the ongoing open-label study 
R1500-CL-1719 and data from the ongoing open-label phase from patients with persistent 
hypercholesterolemia (R1500-CL-1643). This both includes patients already treated to any of the 
placebo-controlled phases as newly included patients.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 199 patients received any IV dose of evinacumab, with a total duration of exposure of 9556 
weeks, or 183.3 patient-years (Table 19). The majority of these patients (174 patients, 87.4%) had a 
least 24 weeks of exposure, and 126 patients (63.3%) had at least 48 weeks of exposure (Table 20). 
Of these 199 patients, 95 (47.7%) had HoFH. Seventy-six HoFH patients were treated with 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W for at least 24 weeks, and 51 of these patients were treated for at least 
48 weeks.

Pivotal study (R1500-CL-1629) 
In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, the mean (SD) number of study drug infusions was similar between the 
evinacumab group (5.95 [0.211] infusions) and placebo group (5.62 [1.161] infusions), as was the 
duration of study drug exposure (24.14 [1.003] weeks in the evinacumab group; 22.78 [4.633] weeks 
in the placebo group). A total of 38 patients (86.4%) in the evinacumab group and 17 patients 
(81.0%) in the placebo group completed the DBTP with 24 weeks of study drug exposure. 
In R1500-CL-1629 OLTP, a total of 43 patients (97.7%) who received evinacumab during the 24 weeks 
DBTP and continued in the 24 weeks OLTP completed the open-label treatment period. 
Placebo-Controlled Pool  
The mean (SD) number of study drug infusions and the duration of study drug exposure were 
comparable between the groups (5.7 [1.02-1.06] in the all evinacumab and placebo groups and 5.8 
[0.84] in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg group) (Table 65). The proportion of patients who completed the

Based on updated data (cut-off of 28 August 2020) from study R1500-CL-1719, the mean duration of 
evinacumab treatment administration in study R1500-CL-1719 for all patients was 52.7 weeks, ranging 
from 4.1 to 132.1 weeks. There were 110 and 58 patients that had greater than 24 and 48 weeks of 
treatment exposure, respectively. 
Adverse events 
Pivotal study 
In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, TEAEs were frequently reported; however, the percentage of subjects with 
any TEAE was lower in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W group (65.9%) compared with the placebo

group (81.0%) (Table 22). The most frequent AEs (≥5.0% of the patients) with a greater incidence 
with evinacumab compared with placebo were influenza-like illness (11.4% vs 0 patients) and 
rhinorrhea (6.8% vs 0 patients). The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator related to study 
drug was higher in the evinacumab group compared with the placebo group (11.4% (n=5) vs 4.8% 
(n=1), respectively). The drug-related AEs in the evinacumab group included infusion site pruritus (2 
patients), pyrexia, vascular pain and muscular weakness (1 patient), gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis 
and epistaxis (1 patient), and upper respiratory tract inflammation and nasopharyngitis (1 patient). 
One patient in the placebo group had treatment-related TEAEs of face oedema and infusion site 
hypoesthesia.

Organ Class and PT (Double-Blind Safety Analysis Set – DBTP) 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
In the placebo-controlled studies pool, the percentage of patients with any TEAE was comparable 
between the treatments groups (~74%)(Table 23). The most frequent AEs (≥5.0% of the patients) 
with a higher incidence (≥2.0% difference) with all evinacumab IV doses compared with placebo were 
nausea (5.1% vs 1.9%), influenza-like illness (7.7% vs 5.6%), pain in extremity (5.1% vs 0), and 
dizziness (6.0% vs 0%). These events were also experienced by more patients (≥2.0% difference) in 
the evinacumab 15 mg/kg group than the placebo group, with the exception of influenza-like illness 
which was higher compared with the placebo group although no ≥2.0% difference. Additionally, more 
patients (≥2.0% difference) in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg group experienced nasopharyngitis compared 
with placebo (16.0% vs 13.0%, respectively). None of the TEAEs of nausea, influenza-like illness, pain 
in extremity, or dizziness were serious or severe. The majority of TEAEs were classified as mild or 
moderate in intensity.

The incidence of drug-related AEs was higher in the evinacumab groups compared with the placebo 
group (10.3% (n=12) in the all evinacumab IV doses group, 11.1% (n=9) in the evinacumab 15 
mg/kg IV group vs 7.4% (n=4) in the placebo group). The drug-related TEAEs which occurred in > 1 
patient in any evinacumab treatment group were infusion site pruritus (n=2 (2.5%), both in the 15 
mg/kg IV evinacumab group) and nasopharyngitis (n=2 (2.5%), both in the 15 mg/kg IV evinacumab 
group). Drug-related TEAEs which occurred in a single patient treated with evinacumab and none of 
the placebo patients included nausea, influenza illness, pyrexia, anaphylactic reaction, drug 
hypersensitivity, gastroenteritis, muscular weakness, epistaxis, nasal congestion, visual impairment, 
fatigue, upper respiratory tract inflammation.

AEs considered by the investigator related to study drug, all of which occurred on 1 patient with the 
exception of muscle spasms (2 patients). Six of the 10 patients experienced treatment-related events 
of infusion reactions (1 patient each with drug hypersensitivity, pruritus generalized, malaise and 
muscle spasm, 1 patient with infusion-related reaction and asthenia, and 1 patient with feeling hot, 
swelling face, headache and paraesthesia). 
Adverse events of special interest 
General allergic events 
Pivotal study  
In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, the percentage of patients experiencing a general allergic event was lower in 
the evinacumab 15mg/kg IV dose group compared with placebo in R1500-CL-1629 (5 patients (9.1%) 
vs 3 patient (14.3%) and in all cases, the event was comprised of a single patient (asthma, rash, 
rhinitis allergic, urticaria for the evinacumab group). None of the events was serious, of severe 
intensity or led to study treatment discontinuation.  
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
In the placebo-controlled pool, the incidences in allergic events were comparable between the 
treatment groups (11.1% (n=13) for all evinacumab IV doses, 11.1% (n=9) for evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV group and 11.1% (n=6) for the placebo group (Table 24), with no clear differences between single 
term AEs. The only serious general allergic TEAE was an anaphylactic reaction reported in a patient 
treated with evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV. Two (1.7%) patients in the all evinacumab IV doses group 
(anaphylactic reaction (15 mg/kg) and rash (5 mg/kg) and 1 (1.9%) patient in the placebo group 
(pruritus), discontinued study treatment due to a general allergic TEAE.

Uncontrolled Pool 
In the uncontrolled studies pool, a lower percentage of patients experienced general allergic TEAEs 
with evinacumab compared with the placebo-controlled studies pool (4.9% in the total evinacumab 15 
mg/kg group). In the updated data from study 7019, allergic reactions were reported in 13 (11.3%) of 
the patients with mostly pruritus (3.5%), eczema (1.7%) and rash (1.7%). 
Infusion reactions 
Pivotal study 
In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, infusion reaction TEAEs were reported more frequently in the evinacumab 
group compared with the placebo group (6.8% (n=3) vs 4.8% (n=1), respectively). For evinacumab, 
these were 2 patients (4.5%) with infusion site pruritis and 1 patient (2.3%) each with pyrexia (2.3%), 
muscular weakness (2.3%), and vascular pain (2.3%); the same patient experienced the pyrexia, 
muscular weakness, and vascular pain.  
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
Infusion reaction TEAEs were reported more frequently in the evinacumab groups compared with the 
placebo group (7.7% (n=9) for all evinacumab IV doses, 7.4% (n=6) for evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV 
group vs 3.7% (n=2) in the placebo group. The only infusion reaction TEAE reported in more than a 
single patient in any treatment group was infusion site pruritus (2 [1.7%] patients in the All 
Evinacumab IV Doses group and 0 in the placebo group). Both patients who experienced infusion site 
pruritus received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV. The only serious infusion reaction TEAE was an 
anaphylactic reaction reported in a patient treated with evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV. Two (1.7%) patients 
in the all evinacumab IV doses group discontinued study treatment due to an infusion reaction TEAE 
(anaphylactic reaction and rash) compared to 0 in the placebo group (see also above). 
Uncontrolled Pool 
Infusion reactions TEAEs were reported in 8 (4.4%) patients in the total evinacumab group. None of 
these events was fatal or serious or led to discontinuation of evinacumab treatment. In the updated 
data from study 7019, infusion reactions were reported in 6 (5.2%) patients with asthenia (1.7%) and 
headache (1.7%) as mostly reported. 
Hepatic disorders/ liver enzyme elevations 
No patients in any treatment group experienced a hepatic disorder regardless of the pool. The 
percentage of patients who showed liver function test abnormalities were low and approximately 
similar between the treatment groups (Table 25). In the uncontrolled pool, these abnormalities were 
reported with similar low frequency.

Double-blind treatment periods of placebo-controlled studies: 1629 and 1643 
PCSV: Potentially clinically significant value. TEAE: Treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Note: The number (n) represents the subset of the total number of patients who met the criterion at least once during 
the TEAE period. The denominator (/N1) for each parameter within a treatment group is the number of patients who 
had that parameter assessed post-baseline (not missing) during the TEAE period. For PCSV including condition based 
only on  change from  baseline  the  denominator  is  restricted on  patients  having  (not  missing) baseline  and  a post-
baseline values during the TEAE period. 
A patient who had 2 or more post-baseline PCSVs for the same test criteria is counted only once and presented by 
the worst PCSV. 
Patients can be counted in more than one category within a laboratory test. 
Double-blind TEAE period is defined from the day of the first dose of double-blind study treatment administration to 
the day of the last dose of double-blind study treatment administration + 168 days (24 weeks) for those patients not 
proceeding into the OLTP or up to the day before the first dose of open-label study treatment administration for those 
patients proceeding into the OLTP.

In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, muscle-related AEs were more frequently reported in the evinacumab group 
compared with the placebo group (15.9% (n=7) vs 9.5% (n=2), respectively). The muscle-related AEs 
in the evinacumab included arthralgia, back pain, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal 
chest pain, myalgia intercostal, neck pain, and pain in extremity. None of these events occurred in 
more than 1 patient. Further, no meaningful changes from baseline in CK were observed, with a mean 
(SD) change from baseline to week 24 of -13.7 U/L (91.51) in the evinacumab treatment group and -
20.1 U/L (284.34) in the placebo treatment group.  
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
The incidence in muscle-related AEs was slightly higher in the evinacumab groups compared with the 
placebo group (23.9% (n=28) in the all evinacumab IV doses group, 21.0% (n=17)  in the 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV group and 20.4% (n=11) in the placebo group (Table 26). The muscle-
related TEAEs reported in ≥3% of patients in either evinacumab treatment group and at a higher 
frequency than placebo included back pain (5.1% all evinacumab, 3.7% evinacumab 15 mg/kg, 3.7% 
placebo) and pain in extremity (5.1% all evinacumab, 3.7% evinacumab 15 mg/kg, 0% placebo). In 
contrast, the following TEAEs in this SOC were reported in ≥3% of patients in the placebo group and at 
a higher frequency than either evinacumab treatment group: myalgia (5.1% all evinacumab, 2.5% 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg, 11.1% placebo) and arthralgia (3.4% all evinacumab, 2.5% evinacumab 15 
mg/kg, 5.6% placebo). Further, no meaningful changes from baseline in CK were observed, with a 
mean (SD) change from baseline to week 24 of 5.0 (96.04) U/L in the All Evinacumab IV Doses group, 
4.4 (104.09) U/L in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV group, and -10.1 (176.74) U/L in the placebo group. 
Additionally, no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups were noted for PCSVs in CK 
(Table 27).

PCSV: Potentially clinically significant value. TEAE: Treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Note: The number (n) represents the subset of the total number of patients who met the criterion at least once during 
the TEAE period. The denominator (/N1) for each parameter within a treatment group is the number of patients who 
had that parameter assessed post-baseline (not missing) during the TEAE period. For PCSV including condition based 
only on change from baseline, the denominator is restricted on patients having (not missing) baseline and a post-
baseline values during the TEAE period. 
A patient who had 2 or more post-baseline PCSVs for the same test criteria is counted only once and presented by 
the worst PCSV. 
Patients can be counted in more than one category within a laboratory test. 
Double-blind TEAE period is defined from the day of the first dose of double-blind study treatment administration to 
the day of the last dose of double-blind study treatment administration + 168 days (24 weeks) for those patients not 
proceeding into the OLTP, or up to the day before the first dose of open-label study treatment administration for those 
patients proceeding into the OLTP. 
[1] Evinacumab doses include 5 mg/kg (1643 only) and 15 mg/kg. 
Uncontrolled Pool 
Muscle-related AEs were reported in 28 (15.4%) patients in the total evinacumab group. The only 
muscle-related AEs reported in ≥3% of patients in the total evinacumab group was back pain (4.9%). 
CK elevations >5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 5 patients, which either returned to 
toward baseline while continuing study treatment or were considered resolved if reported as a TEAE. 
Further, most CK elevations >5 x ULN were attributed to strenuous exercise. In the updated data from 
study 7019, muscle related events were frequently observed (21.7%). Some patients reported 
increased CK levels, 4.4% > 3 x ULN and ≤ 5 x ULN, 3.5% > 5 x ULN and ≤ 10 x ULN, and 0.9% > 10 
x ULN, which is slightly higher than in the other studies. 
Diabetes 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
No patient in any treatment group experienced a new-onset of diabetes. Two patients in the all 
evinacumab group compared to one patient in the placebo group met the criteria for new-onset

diabetes. However, one patient who received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in the R1500-CL-1629 DBTP 
already had HbA1c ≥ 6.5% at baseline, suggesting that the patient was diabetic prior initiating study 
treatment. Additionally, the second patient who received evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV had baseline and 
post-baseline fasting glucose levels near to the cut-off values for diabetes, i.e. borderline diabetic 
patients and high likely did not reflect true new-onset diabetes.  
With respect to diabetic complications, potentially clinically significant values for hyperglycemia were 
reported in 11 patients (9.4%) in the all evinacumab group, including 7 patients (8.6%) in the 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg group, compared to 2 patients (3.8%) patients in the placebo group. Most of 
these values were isolated, transient, and returned to within normal limits at the next visit except in 3 
patients. These 3 patients (1 in the evinacumab 5 mg/kg group and 2 in the 15 mg/kg group) had 
more than a single fasting glucose value >126 mg/dL. Two of these 3 patients met the criteria for 
consideration of NOD (see above). The other patient was diabetic at baseline and had no diabetic 
complication TEAEs. 
Uncontrolled Pool 
Three patients met the criteria for new-onset diabetes; however, patient narratives did not suggest 
true new-onset diabetes. PCSVs for hyperglycemia (at least 1 fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL with 
baseline < 126 mg/dL) were reported in 6.4% of patients in the total evinacumab group. Most of these 
values were isolated, transient, and returned to within normal limits at the next visit. 
Other AESIs 
The limited data provided does not suggest any safety concerns for evinacumab related with cataracts 
and neurologic events. Additionally, no cases of symptomatic overdose, neurocognitive events, 
pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs were reported in any safety set. 
Adverse drug reactions 
In order to identify ADRs from the evinacumab clinical data, the placebo-controlled studies pool safety 
data were screened as follows: 
 - Adverse events of specific interest for evinacumab as a monoclonal antibody or base on theoretical 
concerns with lipid-lowering 
- All TEAEs at the PT level occurring in 3.0% or more of patients in the all evinacumab IV doses group 
or evinacumab 15 mg/kg group with a 1.0% or greater frequency than the placebo group were 
reviewed 
- For each TEAE at the PT level, risk differences between the all Evinacumab IV doses group and 
placebo group and the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV group and placebo group were evaluated to identify 
each TEAE for which the lower bound of the 95% CI was ≥0.1%. 
Safety data from the uncontrolled studies pool were screened in the same manner with the exception 
of risk differences evaluation. 
Based on this review, the following ADRs have been identified: nasopharyngitis, influenza-like Illness, 
dizziness, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, rhinorrhea, and asthenia.  
Additionally, systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions, have 
been reported and, as such, included in the labelling.

patients (4.5%) in the evinacumab group vs 0 patient (0%) in the placebo group 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
Ten patients (8.5%) in all Evinacumab IV doses group experienced 13 serious TEAEs. In the 15 mg/kg 
IV group, 8 patients (9.9%) experienced 9 serious TEAEs. In the placebo group, 1 patient (1.9%) 
experienced 1 serious TEAE (Table 29). One serious TEAE of an anaphylactic reaction was considered 
to be related to study drug; the remaining serious TEAEs did not appear to be related to evinacumab. 
In most cases, the event could be attributed to the patient’s underlying medical history, concomitant 
medication, or injuries.

SOC is sorted alphabetically and PT sorted by decreasing frequency of the All Evinacumab IV Doses group. 
[1] Evinacumab doses include 5 mg/kg (1643 only) and 15 mg/kg. 
Uncontrolled Pool 
In the uncontrolled pool, 15 patients (8.2%) in the Total Evinacumab group experienced 20 serious 
TEAEs. The majority of serious TEAEs were cardiovascular in nature, or occurred in the context of a 
cardiac event, reflecting the patients’ underlying medical history. In the updated data from study 7019, 
serious adverse events were limited with unstable angina (2 (1.7%)), aortic valve disease (2 (1.7%)), 
and chest pain (2 (1.7%)) as most reported. 
Deaths 
No deaths were observed in patients treated with evinacumab or placebo. In the updated data from 
study 7019, two deaths were reported, very likely because of MI, and unrelated to study drug. 
Adjudicated cardiovascular events 
Pivotal study 
In R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, there were no positively adjudicated cardiovascular events. 
In R1500-CL-1629 OLTP, 2 patients experienced positively adjudicated CV events. One patient 
experienced TEAEs of cardiac procedure complication and acute myocardial infarction and underwent a 
coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention, which were adjudicated to non-
fatal myocardial infarction and ischemia-driven coronary revascularization procedure. Another patient 
experienced a TEAE of coronary artery disease and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 99/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was adjudicated to ischemia-driven coronary revascularization procedure. All of these events were 
serious, severe in intensity, considered unrelated to the study drug, and were recorded to be 
recovered/resolved. 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
In the placebo-controlled studies pool, there were 2 patients with cardiovascular events that were 
positively adjudicated (1 event each in the evinacumab 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg IV dose groups). Both 
events were ischemia-driven coronary revascularization procedures in patients with a prior medical 
history of ischemic heart disease.  
Uncontrolled Pool 
In the uncontrolled studies pool, a total of 3 patients in the total evinacumab group experienced 
positively adjudicated CV events, all of whom were in the continue evinacumab group. In addition to 
the 2 patients described above in the open-label period of the pivotal study, 1 patient had a serious 
TEAE of palpitations that was positively adjudicated to ischemia-driven coronary revascularization 
procedure. In the updated data from study 7019, 1 patient (0.9%) had unstable angina requiring 
hospitalization, and 4 (3.5%) patients had ischemia-driven coronary revascularization (and 2 patients 
died likely due to MI). 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in any haematology parameters (red blood 
cells, platelets, or white blood cells) nor clinically meaningful differences between the evinacumab and 
placebo groups with respect to the number of patients with haematology abnormalities that fell into 
the predefined potentially clinically significant value (PCSV) categories for red blood cells, platelets, 
leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the R1500-CL-1629 DBTP and the 
placebo-controlled pool. However, a higher incidence in patients with potentially clinically significant 
variables related to monocytes was observed with evinacumab treatment compared with placebo (12% 
(n=14) in the all evinacumab IV doses group, 13.6% (n=11)  in the 15 mg/kg group and 5.7% (n=3) 
in the placebo group). 
Uncontrolled Pool 
In the uncontrolled studies pool, a comparable high incidence in PCSVs related to monocytes was 
observed (~11.0% in all evinacumab groups). The majority of these elevations were singular or 
transient events with resolution towards baseline with continued evinacumab treatment and therefore 
did not appear to be related to evinacumab treatment according to the Applicant. 
Clinical chemistry 
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline or difference PCSVs in metabolic function, 
electrolytes, renal function or liver function parameters observed in the pivotal study, the placebo-
controlled pool and the uncontrolled pool. 
For details on metabolic, liver and renal function, please see AEs of special interest. 
Vital signs 
Evinacumab treatment did not result in any clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or ECG 
parameters.

Safety in special populations 
Gender 
TEAEs were more frequently reported in female patients than in male patients (85.7% vs 61.5% in the 
all evinacumab IV doses group, respectively). Moreover, the incidence in TEAEs in females treated with 
evinacumab was also higher compared to placebo female patients (85.7% vs 79.3, respectively), 
whereas the incidence in TEAEs in males was lower in the all evinacumab IV doses group compared 
with placebo (61.5% vs 68.0%, respectively). Nevertheless, the most frequent AEs with a higher 
incidence with evinacumab compared with placebo observed in both female and male were in general 
similar as those found in the total placebo-controlled population.  
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients. Three patients were aged ≥75 years in the 
placebo-controlled pool and 2 patients in the uncontrolled pool, therefore, no subgroup analyses were 
performed for patients ≥75 years of age. Nevertheless, subgroup analyses showed a higher incidence in 
any TEAE compared with placebo with advancing age. 
Placebo-controlled Pool 
Of the 171 total patients in the placebo-controlled pool, 142 were aged ≥18 to <65 years. In this 
subgroup of patients, 68 patients (70.8%) in the all evinacumab IV doses group (including 48 [70.6%] 
in the 15 mg/kg group) and 35 patients (76.1%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 TEAE. 
Preferred terms reported by a greater percentage of patients in the all evinacumab IV doses group 
than in the placebo group were similar to those seen in the total placebo-controlled pool population. 
Twenty-four of the 171 total patients were aged ≥65 to <75 years. In this subgroup of patients, 17 
patients (89.5%) in the all evinacumab IV doses group (including 10 [90.9%] in the 15 mg/kg group) 
and 3 patients (60.0%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 TEAE. No safety concerns were 
identified from these TEAEs in patients aged ≥65 years.  
Uncontrolled Pool 
Of the 182 total patients in the uncontrolled pool, 153 were aged ≥18 to <65 years, and 24 were aged 
≥65 to <75 years. In the subgroup of ≥18 to <65 years, 102 patients (66.7%) experienced at least 1 
TEAE in the total evinacumab 25 mg/kg group of which 64 patients (72.7%) in the continue 
evinacumab and 38 (58.5%) in the new evinacumab groups. In the subgroup of ≥65 to <75 years, 19 
patients (79.2%) experienced at least 1 TEAE in the total evinacumab 25 mg/kg group of which 15 
patients (78.9%) in the continue evinacumab and 38 (80.0%) in the new evinacumab groups. 
Adolescents  
Placebo-controlled Pool 
Of the 171 total patients in the placebo-controlled pool, only 2 patients were aged ≥12 to <18 years 
(all HoFH patients): 1 patient in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg group, who experienced 1 TEAE of 
influenza-like illness and 1 patient in the placebo group, who experienced 3 TEAEs of abdominal pain, 
nasopharyngitis, and headache. 
Uncontrolled Pool 
In the updated data from study 7109, 13 adolescent patients have been included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021

Immunological events 
No treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted anti-drug antibody responses were observed in R1500-
CL-1629, the placebo-controlled studies pool, or the uncontrolled studies pool. 
Please see section AESI for information on general allergic reactions. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As a monoclonal antibody, evinacumab is not anticipated to interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) or 
drug transporters, and drug-drug interactions between evinacumab and other drugs is not anticipated. 
Thus, no drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pivotal study 
Both in the double-blind period and in the open-label period of the pivotal study, no patients 
experienced a TEAE leading to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Placebo-Controlled Pool 
Four patients in the all evinacumab group (3.4%) vs 1 (1.9%) for placebo discontinued the treatment 
due to TEAE, with no single adverse event occurring in more than one patient and without any clear 
pattern (Table 30).

Supportive study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia 
R1500-HTG-1522 is an ongoing, phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of evinacumab in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia at risk for acute 
pancreatitis. Patients in this study were randomized to receive 15 mg/kg IV or placebo Q4W in a 12 
weeks double-blind treatment period, then all patients received 15 mg/kg IV Q4W in a 12 week, 
single-blind treatment period, followed by a 24-week, off-drug, follow-up period.  
A total of 25 (71.4%) patients in the evinacumab treatment group (n=35) and 11 (68.8%) patients in 
the placebo treatment group (n=16) experienced at least 1 TEAE. Most frequently reported AEs were 
abdominal pain (5 versus 2 patients), headache (4 versus 1), constipation (3 versus 0. Two 
discontinuations due to AEs (evinacumab group only) were reported (influenza-like illness and 
pancreatitis acute). No deaths were reported.

N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment primarily focuses on the double-blind treatment period (DBTP) of the individual 
pivotal study R1500-CL-1629 (HoFH subset) and placebo-controlled studies pool (HoFH and persistent 
hypercholesterolemia subset), as the HoFH group includes patients proposed to be indicated and the 
persistent hypercholesterolemia subset provides additional safety data due to the number of patients 
and comparative study design elements. Considering that HoFH patients and persistent 
hypercholesterolemia generally have similar patient characteristics, with elevated LDL-C as key 
characteristic, the integrations of safety data are appropriate. 
Patient exposure. For the proposed target group of HoFH, a very limited number of patients has been 
exposed to the proposed evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W dose, i.e. 76 HoFH patients for at least 24 
weeks and 51 HoFH patients for at least 48 weeks, with placebo-controlled safety for at least 24 weeks 
available for only 38 HoFH from the pivotal study. Placebo-controlled safety data on HoFH are 
supported by safety data on persistent hypercholesterolemic patients (study R1500-CL-1643), which 
increased the available exposure data with 29 patients exposed to evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W and 
28 patients to evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W  for at least 24 weeks, which still remains limited, 
especially, considering that evinacumab is intended for life-long treatment. In the uncontrolled studies 
Assessment report

pool, 58 patients were exposed to evinacumab for ≥ 48 weeks. Overall, the safety data in HoFH 
patients is very limited; however, expected considering the rarity of the disease. Nevertheless, an 
ongoing 4 years open label study R1500-CL-1719 and a PASS agreed as specific obligation in the 
context of MA under exceptional circumstances could provide some additional data to further evaluate 
long-term safety. 
Adverse events. In the DBTP of the pivotal study, TEAEs were frequently reported, however, the 
percentage of subjects with one or more adverse events was lower in evinacumab 15 mg/kg (65.9%) 
compared with placebo (81.0%). In the placebo-controlled studies pool, the percentage of patients 
with any TEAE was similar between the treatments groups (~74%), which is reassuring.  
In the DBTP of the pivotal study, the most frequent AEs (≥ 5.0% patients) with a higher incidence with 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg compared with placebo were influenza-like illness (11.4% vs 0%) and 
rhinorrhea (6.8% vs 0 patients). In the placebo-controlled studies pool, the most frequent AE (≥ 5.0% 
patients) with a higher incidence (≥ 2.0% difference) with all evinacumab compared with placebo were 
nausea (5.1% vs 1.9%), influenza-like illness (7.7% vs 5.6%), pain in extremity (5.1% vs 0), and 
dizziness (6.0% vs 0%). These events were also more frequently reported (≥ 2.0% difference) in 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg compared with placebo, with the exception of influenza-like illness (<2.0% 
difference). Additionally, the percentage of patients who experienced nasopharyngitis was greater (≥
2.0% difference) in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg group than the placebo group (16.0% vs 13.0%). 
Therefore, although the safety data of the 5 mg/kg IV Q4W data from the study in persistent 
hypercholesterolemic patients (R1500-CL-1643) has not been presented separately, a clear dose-
dependent appearance of adverse events was not observed. In the uncontrolled studies pool, the TAEs 
occurred in comparable proportions as observed in the placebo-controlled studies pool. 
AEs of special interest. General allergic events. No difference between treatment groups were noted 
for general allergic TEAEs (SMQ “hypersensitivity” excluding the PT linked to local injection site 
reactions). The percentage of patients experiencing a general allergic event was lower in evinacumab 
15mg/kg compared with placebo in the pivotal study (9.1% (n=5) vs 14.3% (n=3), respectively) and 
comparable across the groups in the placebo-controlled studies pool (~11%). General allergic events 
reported in more than a single patient in any treatment group included asthma, (1.7% (n=2) all 
evinacumab vs 0% placebo), conjunctivitis (1.7% (n=2) vs 0%), rash (1.7% (n=2) vs 0%), and 
pruritus (0.9% (n=1) vs 3.7%(n=2)). None of the adverse events was a SAE, with the exception of 
one anaphylactic reaction in one persistent hypercholesterolemic patient on evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
Q4W, which was considered related to study drug. Consequently, anaphylactic reaction as ADR is 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC,. In the uncontrolled studies pool, a comparable proportion of 
patients experienced general allergic TEAEs with evinacumab. Moreover, anti-evinacumab antibodies 
were not reported in any of the safety analysis sets. 
Infusion reactions. Infusion reaction TEAEs were reported more frequently with treatment with 
evinacumab compared with placebo; 3 patients (6.8%) in the evinacumab group vs 1 patient (4.8%) in 
the placebo group in the pivotal study and 9 patients (7.7%) in the all evinacumab group and 6 
patients (7.4%) in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV group vs 2 patients (3.7%) in the placebo group in 
the placebo-controlled studies pool. In the pivotal study, the infusion reactions with evinacumab 
treatment included infusion site pruritis, pyrexia, muscular weakness, and vascular pain. In the 
placebo-controlled pool, the only infusion reaction TEAE reported in more than a single patient in any 
treatment group was infusion site pruritus (2 patients who received 15mg/kg evinacumab vs 0 in the 
placebo group). There was one serious infusion reaction TEAE of anaphylactic reaction which is already 
discussed above. In the uncontrolled studies pool, 8 patients (4.4%) experienced infusion reactions of 
which none were reported in more than a single patient.

EMA/250315/2021

Hepatic disorders/liver enzyme elevations. Treatment with evinacumab was not associated with safety 
concerns related to the liver. No patients in any treatment group experienced a hepatic disorder 
regardless of the pool, and the percentage of patients who met the pre-defined definition for liver 
function test abnormalities were low and approximately similar between the treatment groups, which is 
reassuring. Although, liver fat fraction, in addition to liver enzyme evaluation, has not been examined. 
Muscle events/creatine kinase (CK) elevation. The incidence of muscle-related TEAE was higher in the 
evinacumab groups compared with the placebo group; 15.9% (n=7) vs 9.5% (n=2), respectively, in 
the pivotal study and 23.9% (n=28) in the all evinacumab group and 21.0% (n=17)  in the 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg group and 20.4% (n=11) in the placebo group in the placebo-controlled studies 
pool. In the pivotal study, these AEs included arthralgia, back pain, muscle spasms, muscular 
weakness, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia intercostal, neck pain, and pain in extremity, of which 
none occurred in more than 1 patient. In the placebo-controlled studies pool, back pain (5.1% all 
evinacumab and 3.7% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 3.7% placebo) and pain in extremity (5.1% all 
evinacumab and 3.7% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 0% placebo) were reported with higher frequency (≥
3.0%) for evinacumab, while myalgia (5.1% all evinacumab and 2.5% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 
11.1% placebo) and arthralgia (3.4% all evinacumab and 2.5% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 5.6% 
placebo) were reported with a higher frequency in the placebo group. In the uncontrolled pool, the only 
muscle-related AEs (≥3.0%) in the total evinacumab group was back pain (4.9%) and, therefore, did 
not reveal new muscle-related AEs. back pain, and pain in extremity was included as ADRs in section 
4.8 of the SmPC.  
New onset of diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications. The limited data provided 
suggested that evinacumab is not associated with safety concerns related to glycemic control or 
diabetes in patients with or without diabetes at baseline. 
Furthermore, the limited data provided does not suggest any safety concerns for evinacumab related 
to cataracts and neurologic events. Furthermore, no cases of symptomatic overdose, neurocognitive 
events, pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs were reported in any safety set. 
These observations are somewhat supported by a genetic study of 650 carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF 
variants, which shows no association with any apparent increase in adverse clinical outcomes, 
including liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurological diseases, risk of cancer or overall 
mortality. Nevertheless, the safety results of carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF variants are difficult to 
extrapolate to HoFH patients treated with evinacumab, among other things since the lipid profile 
between both populations are very different with severely elevated LDL-C levels in HoFH, while 
ANGPTL3 is suggested to play an important role in lipid metabolism. Additionally, in the genetic study, 
almost all patients were heterozygous ANGPTL3 LOF variants whereas, with evinacumab treatment, all 
ANGPTL3 in the serum is neutralised mimicking complete loss of ANGPTL3 function. Consequently, 
higher reductions in different lipid parameters were observed in HoFH patients treated with 
evinacumab compared with LOF variants compared with (LDL-C:-49% vs -10%,  TG: - 50% vs -
30.2%, and HDL-C -30% vs -7%, respectively). 
Adverse drug reactions. In order to identify ADRs from the evinacumab clinical data, the placebo-
controlled studies pool safety were screened for AESIs, all AE at the PT level occurring in ≥3.0% of 
patients in both evinacumab groups, and risk differences (lower bound of the 95% CI was ≥0.1%) 
between the evinacumab groups and placebo for each AE at the PT level. Safety data from the 
uncontrolled studies pool were screened in the same manner with the exception of risk differences 
evaluation. Based on frequency differences with placebo, the following ADRs have been identified: 
nasopharyngitis, influenza-like illness, dizziness, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, 
rhinorrhea, and asthenia. Further, evaluation of AE of interest identified infusion reactions with a slight

Page 105/123 
 
 
 
frequency difference for infusion site pruritus as an ADR. Additionally, based on the exposure-time 
relationship, a single patient reporting of anaphylaxis has been included as ADR.  
The incidence of AEs considered by the investigator related to study drug was higher in the 
evinacumab groups compared with the placebo groups; 11.4% (n=5) vs 4.8% (n=2), respectively, in 
the pivotal study and 10.3% (n=12) in all evinacumab IV and 11.1% (n=9) in the evinacumab 15 
mg/kg vs 7.4% (n=4) in placebo in the placebo-controlled studies pool. In the pivotal study, the drug-
related AEs in the evinacumab group included infusion site pruritus (2 patients), pyrexia, vascular pain 
and muscular weakness (1 patient), gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis and epistaxis (1 patient), and 
upper respiratory tract inflammation and nasopharyngitis (1 patient). In the placebo-controlled studies 
pool, the most common drug-related AEs  (>1 patient) in the evinacumab groups were infusion site 
pruritus (n=2 (2.5%), both in the 15 mg/kg IV evinacumab group), and nasopharyngitis (n=2 (2.5%), 
both in the 15 mg/kg IV evinacumab group).  
In the placebo-controlled studies pool, upper respiratory tract infection was more frequently reported 
in evinacumab treated patients (2.6%) compared with 0 patients in placebo and in 6.0% in the total 
evinacumab group in the uncontrolled studies pool. Upper respiratory tract infection is considered an 
ADR and included in the labelling.  
Serious AEs. The incidence of SAEs was higher in the evinacumab groups compared with the placebo 
groups; 2 patients (4.5%) in evinacumab vs none in the placebo group in the pivotal study and 10 
patients (8.5%) in all evinacumab and 8 patients (9.9%) in evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 1 patient (1.9%) 
in placebo in the placebo-controlled studies pool. However, no pattern indicative for a safety signal 
could be identified among the SAEs, which is reassuring. Moreover, all SAEs were considered not 
related to study treatment, with the exception of one anaphylactic reaction event which was included 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In the uncontrolled pool, 15 patients (8.2%) in the total evinacumab group 
experienced 20 serious TEAEs of which the majority were cardiovascular related, reflecting the 
patients’ underlying medical history. 
Deaths. No deaths were observed in patients treated with evinacumab or placebo, regardless of the 
safety analysis set. Two deaths were reported in the ongoing open-label study, but not considered 
related to treatment. 
Adjudicated cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events and deaths are of interest, and a harmful 
effect should at least be excluded prior to registration for a new pharmacological class according to the 
EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013). However, due to the rarity of HoFH, exclusion of a detrimental effect of 
evinacumab in the target population seems not feasible, as such, no comprehensive data regarding 
cardiovascular safety could be provided and therefore remains uncertain and will continue to be 
evaluated post-authorisation. No positively adjudicated cardiovascular events were reported in the 
DBTP of the pivotal study; however, an imbalance in the incidence in positively adjudicated CV events 
has been reported in the placebo-controlled studies pool (2 patients treated with evinacumab (1 event 
each in the evinacumab 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg IV dose groups) vs none for placebo). Additionally, in 
the uncontrolled studies pool, a limited number of less than 10 patients experienced adjudicated CV 
events. Overall, firm conclusion on cardiovascular safety cannot be made due to the limited number of 
patients and cardiovascular events.  
Laboratory findings. No clinically meaningful differences with respect to red blood cells, platelets, 
leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were observed in the 
R1500-CL-1629 DBTP, the placebo-controlled studies pool and the uncontrolled studies pool.  
With respect to clinical chemistry, please see AESIs.

Vital Signs. Evinacumab treatment did not result in any clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or 
ECG parameters. 
Safety in special populations. Gender. The safety profile observed in both male and female were in 
general similar as those found in the total placebo-controlled studies population.  
Elderly. Patients > 75 of age are underrepresented in the clinical development program (3 patients in 
the placebo-controlled pool and 2 patients in the uncontrolled studies pool). Further, the incidence in 
any AE showed slightly higher event rates compared with placebo with advancing age, likely due to the 
underlying disease and circumstances.  
Adolescents. No specific safety concerns are identified in the 13 investigated adolescents.  
Hepatic and renal impairment. Safety information regarding use of evinacumab in patients with hepatic 
impairment and patients with renal impairment has not been provided and is not available. 
Nevertheless, this issue is not pursued as evinacumab is not expected to undergo significant hepatic or 
renal elimination (see PK assessment). 
Discontinuation due to AEs. AEs leading to discontinuations were not reported in the pivotal study 
and only one in the uncontrolled pool, which is reassuring. In the placebo-controlled studies pool, AEs 
leading to discontinuations were infrequent, however, slightly higher in the evinacumab group (4 
patients (3.4%) in all evinacumab and 2 patients (2.5%) in evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 1 patient (1.9%) 
in placebo). Nevertheless, no pattern with respect to type of AE leading to discontinuation of study 
drug could be observed. 
Supportive study. Currently, a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study, R1500-HTG-1522, to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of evinacumab in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is 
ongoing. The available safety data from this study did not identify new safety signals with evinacumab 
treatment, which was considered reassuring. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
As comprehensive data on safety and efficacy of the product are not available, however the application 
meets the applicable requirements, a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances was 
proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant.  As specific 
obligation a non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) was requested to be conducted 
(please, see also Discussion on Clinical Efficacy). 
The following objectives were agreed for the PASS: (1) to evaluate the long term safety outcomes 
(i.e., hospitalisations, death, and MACE) in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
(HoFH) who are ≥12 years old and treated with evinacumab, (2) to evaluate the frequency and 
outcomes of pregnancy in female patients with HoFH treated with evinacumab and (3) to evaluate the 
atherosclerosis process over time in patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo 
cardiac imaging. The MAH agreed to conduct and submit the results of this study based on data from a 
registry in patients with HoFH. Patients included in the existing disease registry: European 
Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) FH Studies Collaboration (FHSC) Registry were agreed to be the source 
population for this study.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally, evinacumab displays an acceptable safety profile comparable to that of placebo, with low 
discontinuations due to AEs. No pattern indicative for a safety signal could be identified among the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 107/123 
 
 
 
SAEs, although one serious event of an anaphylactic reaction has been reported which was considered 
related to study drug. However, the safety data of evinacumab in HoFH patients is very limited, which 
is expected, considering the rarity of the disease. Nevertheless, even with the inclusion of safety data 
of evinacumab in persistent hypercholesterolemic patients, the safety package remains limited, 
especially considering that evinacumab is intended for life-long treatment. Due to the rarity of HoFH, 
exclusion of a detrimental effect in the target population seemed not feasible, as such, cardiovascular 
safety remains an uncertainty. The safety profile for adolescents is in line with that of the overall 
population.  
To address the uncertainties related to the long term safety in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances, a PASS study including MACE as one of the endpoints is proposed as a Specific 
Obligation to the marketing authorisation.

It is unknown whether evinacumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs 
are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, 
which decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk 
to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 11.02.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that evinacumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers evinacumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evkeeza (evinacumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
- It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU AND 
- It has a PASS imposed; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), Art 10a(1)(a),] AND 
- It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8)]. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Evinacumab is indicated for use as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older 
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is an ultra-rare (~1 in 300,000 in the EU) 
genetic life-threatening condition resulting in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) leading to 
premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, in untreated patients, premature death.  
The genetic disorder is most often caused by the presence of loss-of-function variants in the low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which leads to low or absent hepatic clearance of LDL cholesterol 
from the circulation. Genetic alterations that cause a virtually complete absence of LDL-receptor 
expression (null homozygotes) result in higher LDL cholesterol levels than alterations that partially 
reduce LDL-receptor activity with either two non-null alleles or one null and one non-null allele (nonnull 
homozygotes). 
The goal of therapy in patients with HoFH is to reduce LDL-C, which is believed to reduce 
atherogenesis and subsequently reducing CVD events and mortality. This is based on a large body of 
evidence, especially based on statin therapy, which demonstrates that reduction of LDL-C is associated 
with reduction in CV death and overall mortality; however, any of such association has not been 
robustly demonstrated in HoFH patients.   
Evinacumab is a human monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which 
play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial 
lipase (EL). This would lead to a reduction in LDL-C independent of the presence of an LDL receptor by 
promoting very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance, thereby reducing the VLDL 
pool available to generate LDL-C. Any further details on the mechanism of action, in particular in the 
setting of HoFH with extremely elevated cholesterol levels have not been provided.

EMA/250315/2021  
Page 112/123 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
HoFH patients should be treated with intensive LDL-C lowering drug therapy to lower their highly 
increased LDL-C levels. Currently, available registered therapies include statins, ezetimibe, proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and lomitapide. Non-pharmacological therapies 
include lipid apheresis and liver transplantation.  
Statin therapy is the cornerstone treatment for LDL-C lowering and causes a limited 15-30% reduction 
in LDL-C in patients with HoFH.  
Ezetimibe on top of statins can reduce LDL-C by 20%-27% compared to statin alone. 
PCSK9 inhibitors on top of maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy can result in a reduction in LDL-C 
of approximately 30%. Only evolocumab is currently approved for patients with HoFH; use of 
alirocumab in patients with HoFH is considered off label.  
Lomitapide, a selective inhibitor of microsomal transfer protein (MTP) causes reductions in LDL-C of 
approximately 40%, however, optimal lomitapide treatment is limited by tolerability issues of gastro-
intestinal adverse events. Also, long term safety including e.g. effects on the liver, is still uncertain.  
Apheresis is a non-pharmacological treatment option; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-70% 
relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome and limited available. Also, 
only temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Liver transplantation can be used to treat HoFH, although it is rarely used and considered as a last 
resort treatment option due to the many disadvantages, including high risk of post-transplantation 
surgical complications and mortality, the paucity of donors, and the need for life-long treatment with 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
Due to the limitations of currently available treatments, HoFH are generally sub-optimally treated 
resulting in remaining increased levels of LDL-C (with increased CV risk), as such, there is still an 
unmet medical need for new treatment options for HoFH, especially for HoFH patients with null/null or 
negative/negative mutations where currently available LDL-R dependent lipid lowering therapies (i.e. 
statins and PCSK9 inhibitors) provide no to little benefit in lowering LDL-C. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence was provided by the pivotal phase 3 study R1500-CL-1629 (ELIPSE – HoFH) 
which compared the reduction of LDL-C by evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W (N=44) to placebo (N=21) 
after 24 weeks in patients with HoFH (with background therapy of lipid-modifying therapies, including 
statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, evolocumab, and apheresis), followed by an open-label extension 
period (ELIPSE – OLE) for 24 weeks were all subjects received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. The 
primary endpoint was the percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24. Important 
secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters, including ApoB, TC, non-HDL-C, TG, and 
ApoB/ApoA1. 
Additional safety data was provided by the phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
dose-ranging R1500-CL-1643, in adult patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, or non-
HeFH with a history of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]; 80% HeFH)(R1500-CL-
1643). The study consisted of a 16-week DBTP for the SC dose groups (300 mg QW or Q2W, 450 mg 
QW) or 24-week DBTP for the IV dose groups (5mg/kg Q4W (N=36) or 15 mg/kg Q4W (N=39)), and a 
48-week OLTP for the IV dose groups. In the integrated safety data pools only the safety data of IV 
administration of evinacumab 5 and 15 m/kg Q4W has been included.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 113/123 
 
 
 
Furthermore, in addition to the open-label treatment phases of the pivotal study R1500-CL-1629 and 
study R1500-CL-1643, open-label evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W safety data is derived from the 
ongoing phase 3 open-label study in HoFH patients, R1500-CL-1719, both for more extended 
treatment with evinacumab as for new evinacumab treatment naïve patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
LDL-C reduction. Evinacumab demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in LDL-C of 49.0% as 
compared to placebo background therapy (-47.1% vs +1.9%; 95% CI, –65.0 to –33.1; P<0.001) in a 
limited population of patients (n= 65 with 2:1 ratio) with genetically or clinically confirmed HoFH on 
optimal lipid-lowering therapy with a baseline LDL-C level of 6.7mmol/L (absolute change -3.5 
mmol/L). A reduction in LDL-C was observed as early as week 2 and was maintained throughout the 
24-week double-blind treatment period. Moreover, the effect was maintained throughout an additional 
24 weeks open-label single-arm extension (-46.3%).  
Other endpoints. The LDL-C lowering effect was supported by other lipid parameters, including ApoB 
( 37%), non-HDL-C (-52%), TC (-48%), and TG (-50%). Further, also other secondary endpoints were 
in support of the main findings, e.g. 47% vs 23% achieved LDL-C levels <2.6 mmol/L, 56 vs 5% 
achieved ≥50% reduction in LDL-C, and 33% vs 77% met EU apheresis eligibility criteria, respectively. 
Subgroups. Even though the number of included patients were limited, the effect appears consistent 
among many subgroups including stratification factors of Japan vs rest of the world, apheresis 
background therapy (n=22) or not (n=43) and other subgroups of, e.g. HoFH genotyping, (among 
which n=21 were null/null and n=12 were negative/negative). Moreover, the LDL-C lowering effect 
appears consistent across the range of background therapies, including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, 
and PCSK9 inhibitors. 
Adolescents. Currently 13 adolescent patients have been included in the clinical program and support 
the main findings. Although the inclusion of two adolescents (both null/null genotype) in the pivotal, 
placebo-controlled study is limited, 13 adolescent patients (with 11 patients being evinacumab naïve) 
have been included in the ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-1719. LDL-C reduction at week 24 for 
the single adolescent patient treated with evinacumab was -73.3% and was maintained during 48 
weeks (-72.32%). For the placebo-treated adolescent the effect on LDL-C was +60% during the first 
24 weeks, but efficacy was shown during the subsequent evinacumab 24 weeks treatment period of -
35.7% reduction in LDL-C. Efficacy was also demonstrated in the ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-
1719 with a reduction in LDL-C of -52.4% (SD 29) at 24 weeks (baseline LDL-C of 7.8 mmol/L ) and 
irrespective of the genetic variant for null/null (n=4; -67%) and non-null/null (n=5; -40.6%) patients. 
Secondary lipid parameters are supportive for the primary analysis. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Clinical outcomes. Evinacumab has demonstrated to clinically significantly reduce LDL-C level, an 
established surrogate marker for CV disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been formally 
tested. CV events were only rarely observed, although this was higher for evinacumab than placebo (2 
patients vs none), this could be related to the underlying disease with increased CV risk and thus may 
not be unexpected and likely imbalanced due to chance finding. Any data on a treatment effect on 
atherosclerosis is also not available, while non-clinical data in mice models currently do not show any 
clear, consistent/complete effects on atherosclerosis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 114/123 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action. Although the proof of concept studies demonstrates that evinacumab as a 
human monoclonal antibody inhibits ANGPTL3, which leads to a reduction in LDL-C, the mechanism of 
action in HoFH patients remains not completely understood. Based on more recent studies, it is 
hypothesized that especially endothelial lipase (EL) rather than LPL, plays a more crucial role in the 
reduction of LDL-C via VLDL processing. Any potential for liver fat accumulation seems unlikely, as 
evinacumab seems not to interfere in blocking pathways in the assembly of VLDL particles in the liver 
with fat accumulation as a possible result. 
HDL-C. A substantial reduction in HDL-C has been observed of -30% vs 0.8% for evinacumab and 
placebo, respectively, to lower than normal levels of HDL-C (from a baseline level of 1.14 mmol/L to 
0.80 mmol/L). This is likely due to potentiating of the endothelial lipase with increased HDL-C 
hydrolysis. However, the consequences of the lower than normal HDL-C levels for e.g. cholesterol 
reverse transport are not exactly clear. Further, the clinical implications in terms of cardiovascular risk 
increase is unknown, especially since recent findings challenged a clear correlation between HDL-C 
targeted treatment (increase in HDL-C) and improvement in cardiovascular risk.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events. In the pivotal study, the most frequently reported AEs (≥5.0% patients) with a 
higher incidence in the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W group compared with the placebo group were 
influenza-like illness (11.4% vs 0%) and rhinorrhea (6.8% vs 0%). A generally comparable safety 
profile was observed when the placebo-controlled safety data of the pivotal study (HoFH patients) was 
increased by placebo-controlled data from study R1500-CL-1643 (persistent hypercholesterolemic 
patients), i.e. placebo-controlled studies pool. In this pool, most frequent AE (≥5.0% patients) with a 
higher incidence (≥2.0% difference) with all evinacumab compared with placebo were nausea (5.1% 
vs 1.9%), influenza-like illness (7.7% vs 5.6%), pain in extremity (5.1% vs 0), and dizziness 
(6.0% vs 0%).  
Adverse events of special interest. Infusion reactions were more frequently reported with 
evinacumab vs placebo in the pivotal study (6.8% vs 4.8%, respectively). The infusion reactions with 
evinacumab treatment included infusion site pruritis, pyrexia, muscular weakness, and vascular 
pain. Also, in the placebo-controlled studies pool, infusion reactions were reported more frequently in 
the evinacumab groups compared with placebo (7.7% all evinacumab and 7.4% evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
vs 3.7% placebo). Infusion site pruritus was the only reported infusion reaction AE reported in more 
than 1 patient (2 patients for evinacumab 15mg/kg vs 0 for placebo). None of the infusion reactions 
were serious, with the exception of an anaphylactic reaction in one persistent hypercholesterolemic 
patient on evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W.  
Anti-evinacumab antibodies were not reported in any of the safety analysis sets. Additionally, no 
differences with respect to general allergic TEAES (SMQ “hypersensitivity” excluding the PT linked to 
local injection site reactions) were observed between the treatment groups in the different safety 
analysis sets.  
Muscle-related AEs were more frequently reported in the evinacumab group than the placebo group 
in the pivotal study (15.9% vs 9.5%, respectively). These AEs with evinacumab treatment included 
arthralgia, back pain, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal chest pain, 
myalgia intercostal, neck pain, and pain in extremity, of which none occurred in more than 1 
patient. Also, in the placebo-controlled studies pool, muscle-related were reported more frequently in 
the evinacumab groups compared with the placebo group, although less evident (23.9% all 
evinacumab and 21.0% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 20.4% placebo). Back pain (5.1% all evinacumab, 
and 3.7% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 3.7% placebo) and pain in extremity (5.1% and 3.7% vs 0%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 115/123 
 
 
 
respectively) were reported with a higher frequency (≥3.0%) for evinacumab, while myalgia (5.1% all 
evinacumab and 2.5% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 11.1% placebo) and arthralgia (3.4% all evinacumab 
and 2.5% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 5.6% placebo) were reported with a higher frequency in the 
placebo group.  
Other AEs of special interest. The limited data provided suggested that evinacumab is not 
associated with safety concerns related to glycemic control or diabetes in patients with or without 
diabetes at baseline. Furthermore, the limited data provided does not suggest any safety concerns with 
cataracts and neurologic events. Furthermore, no cases of symptomatic overdose, neurocognitive 
events, pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs were reported in any safety set. 
Serious adverse events. The incidence of SAEs was higher in the evinacumab groups compared with 
the placebo group both in the pivotal study (4.5% vs 0%) and the placebo-controlled pool (8.5% all 
evinacumab and 9.9% evinacumab 15 mg/kg vs 1.9% placebo). However, no pattern indicative for a 
safety signal could be identified among the SAEs and all SAEs were considered not related to study 
treatment, except for one anaphylactic reaction event. 
Deaths. No deaths were observed in patients treated with evinacumab or placebo. 
Tolerability. Generally, evinacumab seems to be well tolerated. No patients experienced AEs leading 
to discontinuation of study treatment in the pivotal study, whereas in the placebo-controlled studies 
pool, these were also limited (4 patients (3.4%) all evinacumab vs 1 patient (1.9%) placebo). Further, 
for only 3 patients, discontinuations due to AE were observed in the uncontrolled studies pool. 
Adolescents. Safety data is available for 13 adolescents HoFH patients; one patient each in the 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg and the placebo group in the pivotal study, and for 13 (2 of those were also 
from the controlled phase) in the ongoing open-label study (mean duration 35 weeks). The safety 
profile is consistent with the overall population.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Exposure. For the proposed target group of HoFH, a very limited number of patients has been 
exposed to the proposed evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W dose, i.e. 76 HoFH patients for at least 24 
weeks and 51 HoFH patients for at least 48 weeks, with placebo-controlled safety data for at least 24 
weeks available for only 38 HoFH patients. Placebo-controlled safety data on HoFH are supported by 
safety data on persistent hypercholesterolemic patients (study R1500-CL-1643), which increased the 
available exposure data with 29 patients exposed to evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W and 28 patients to 
evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W for at least 24 weeks, which still remains limited. 
Adjudicated cardiovascular events. No positively adjudicated cardiovascular events were reported 
in the double-blind period of the pivotal study; however, a small imbalance in the incidence in 
positively adjudicated CV events has been reported in the placebo-controlled studies pool (2 patients 
treated with evinacumab [1 event each in the evinacumab 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg IV dose groups]  vs 
none for placebo). Additionally, in the uncontrolled studies pool, three patients experienced 
adjudicated CV events. Nevertheless, a firm conclusion on cardiovascular safety cannot be made due 
to the limited number of patients and cardiovascular events. 
Hepatic disorders/liver enzyme elevations. No patients in any treatment group experienced a 
hepatic disorder regardless of the pool, and the percentage of patients with liver function test 
abnormalities were low (1-2%) and approximately similar between the treatment groups. However, 
liver fat fraction in addition to liver enzyme evaluation, has not been examined.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 116/123 
 
 
 
Elderly. The incidences in any AEs showed that more safety issues occur in patients with advancing 
age, although these could be attributed to the underlying disease and condition. Patients above 75 
years of age were underrepresented in the clinical development program (3 patients in the placebo-
controlled pool and 2 patients in the uncontrolled studies pool).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Evinacumab has demonstrated a substantial and consistent reduction in LDL-C and other lipid 
parameters, on top of existing therapy options, including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, PCSK9 
inhibitors, and apheresis for patients with HoFH. Efficacy was demonstrated in other types of patients 
with hypercholesterolemia as well. This is considered of clinical relevance as LDL-C is an important 
surrogate endpoint with potential benefits in terms of cardiovascular outcome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 118/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, treatment with evinacumab also demonstrated a decrease in HDL-C to less than normal 
levels of HDL-C, for which the clinical consequences are currently not clear, especially in the setting of 
the HoFH population. The consequences for e.g. reverse cholesterol transport, and any potential 
causative relation to CV risk remains uncertain. Although recent understanding challenges the reverse 
relationship between HDL-C increase and CV risk reduction, some evidence (but not all e.g. gene 
associated low HDL-C levels) suggest that low levels of HDL-C have been associated with CV risk.  
Current data does not allow to provide reasonable conclusions on the overall CV treatment benefit 
based on these seemingly opposing lipid effects, due to very limited occurrence of CV events, although 
it is anticipated that the CV benefit as potentially be derived from LDL-C lowering will possibly not be 
completely offset by the HDL-C effect. Some reassurance has been provided based on effects as seen 
in ANGPTL3 loss-of-function patients; however, extrapolation to the HoFH population seems complex 
due to phenotype differences. Further, due to the rarity of the disease, any possibility to provide 
comprehensive cardiovascular results based on a robust clinical cardiovascular outcome study is 
unlikely to be feasible. Considering this limitation, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was considered appropriate as the date supporting the authorisation were not 
considered comprehensive. In this context, the PASS study was imposed as specific obligation and will 
form the basis for annual reassessment. Data on the impact of evinacumab on the atherosclerosis 
process (e.g. vascular outcome evaluation using imaging techniques of atherosclerosis burden (such as 
MRI, monitoring of coronary calcium content, etc.) and CV treatment effect was agreed to be provided 
post-approval through the PASS study imposed as specific obligation. 
Evinacumab is administered by infusion and infusion reactions with a serious adverse event of 
anaphylaxis related to infusion of evinacumab have been observed. Any other (systemic) 
hypersensitivity reactions are not identified, including a lack of drug antibody formation. Further, 
muscle-related events were also associated with evinacumab treatment, which are generally typical for 
lipid-lowering treatment, and it cannot be excluded that this could to some part be possibly related to 
intensive LLT background therapy. Despite these typical adverse events as observed, evinacumab 
generally appears to be well tolerated, as most of the patients could be treated for at least a year with 
evinacumab, which can be considered relevant for a drug intended for life-long treatment.  
The safety data of evinacumab in HoFH patients is generally limited both in terms of the number of 
patients exposed as well as the limited duration of treatment (also after the inclusion of safety data 
from persistent hypercholesterolemic patients). The ongoing 4 years study could provide some 
additional data to further address this, and as already mentioned a registry-based study to further 
evaluate long-term safety has been agreed as a specific obligation. 
The applicant is applying for use in adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older. Sufficient 
data is currently available in adolescents to make a comparable benefit risk balance assessment in line 
with the analysis done for limited number of adult patients. Treatment of adolescent patients is of 
particular importance, considering the high unmet medical need in children due to early aged onset of 
the disease. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Evinacumab has demonstrated a substantial clinical meaningful reduction in LDL-C on top of existing 
therapy options including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, PCSK9 inhibitors, and apheresis for patients 
with HoFH which could likely address the high unmet medical need for these patients. Although a 
cardiovascular benefit cannot be robustly demonstrated for this rare disease, any efforts for addressing 
this uncertainty post-approval  are warranted, especially as the implications of a reduction in HDL-C 
cannot be sufficiently anticipated. Sufficient number of adolescents have been included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 119/123 
 
 
 
development program to accept including “adolescent patients aged 12 years and older” to the target 
population as proposed. Evinacumab administered every 4 weeks by infusion has an acceptable safety 
profile and is well-tolerated, which is considered important for an intended lifelong treatment. The B/R 
balance is positive, although uncertainties remain, and further data will be provided post-approval to 
address these as best as possible. In this respect, anapproval under exceptional circumstances was 
considered the most appropriate status for this marketing authorisation and was accepted by the 
applicant.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There is a large body of epidemiological evidence demonstrating a strong positive correlation and 
causal relationship between LDL-C and CV risk. In addition, the surrogacy of LDL-C has particularly 
been established based on clinical trials showing that LDL-lowering therapy with statins reduces risk for 
CHD. Data from other types of medicinal products have reinforced this correlation, however, the body 
of clinical evidence for this correlation for each of these separate medicinal product groups (e.g. 
PCSK9, ezetimibe) is far less extensive than for statins.  
The data available for evinacumab were considered not comprehensive. In accordance with the EMA 
guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013, Rev. 3) recommendations, the requirement of clinical studies showing 
beneficial outcome on morbidity and mortality during registration largely depends on the mechanism of 
action and the pharmacological class of the medicinal product and the target population and is not 
foreseen for a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Until clinical trial data are available, it should be 
specifically mentioned in the Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) that beneficial effects on 
mortality and morbidity have not been evaluated. However, any statement that beneficial effects on 
mortality and morbidity have not been evaluated, as proposed, does not completely waive for 
requirements to investigate it further post-authorisation. Generating such level of evidence would not 
be different for evinacumab to consider this medicinal product for a full approval. Any support from 
data in a loss of function (LOF) genetic variant of ANGPTL3 is not considered sufficient to completely 
replace such comprehensive data package, especially considering the challenges to extrapolate such 
genetic LOF phenotype CV risk associations to 1) a different phenotype of HoFH and 2) treatment 
induced changes in the lipid profile CV (alteration) associations. However, due to the rarity of the HoFH 
population (~1 in 300,000 in the EU), it may be challenging if not unfeasible to provide such 
comprehensive data of a robust confirmation on morbidity and mortality. Anticipating that the level of 
evidence is considerably less than what would normally be required for a standard approval, as 
discussed above, a MA under exceptional circumstances will be granted with the main reason that 
indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant 
cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence (see EMEA/357981/2005). 
As a consequence, a specific obligation was agreed and included in Annex IIE to form the basis for 
annual reassessment in the context of MA under exceptional circumstances. This SOB is a non-
interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS). This was considered important given the not 
completely understood new mechanism of action of evinacumab also in relation to the limited 
understanding of the implications of the observed potential off target effect of HDL-C reduction.  
The following objectives were agreed for the PASS: to evaluate the long term safety outcomes (i.e., 
hospitalisations, death, and MACE) in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) 
who are ≥12 years old and treated with evinacumab, to evaluate the frequency and outcomes of 
pregnancy in female patients with HoFH treated with evinacumab and to evaluate the atherosclerosis 
process over time in patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo cardiac 
imaging. The MAH should conduct and submit the results of this study based on data from a registry in 
Assessment report  
EMA/250315/2021  
Page 120/123 
 
 
 
patients with HoFH. Patients included in the existing disease registry: European Atherosclerosis Society 
(EAS) FH Studies Collaboration (FHSC) Registry were agreed to be the source population for this study. 
Inclusion of safety outcomes including MACE, death, and hospitalizations in a defined cohort of patients 
aged 12 years and older who have a diagnosis of HoFH and initiated evinacumab and have received 
evinacumab treatment during the analysis year, is of interest to increase the understanding on long 
term impact of evinacumab on these outcomes.  
Further, any evaluation of vascular damage by imaging of the atherosclerosis process is of particular 
interest as a confirmation between LDL-C lowering surrogate effect and the proposed long-term 
monitoring for MACE events. 
It was agreed to submit a draft protocol synopsis for assessment within 3 months after product 
approval, and annual reports will be submitted as part of annual reassessment. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, and the application meets the applicable 
requirements, a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances was proposed by the CHMP 
during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant.   
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Evkeeza is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Evkeeza is favourable in the following indication: 
Evkeeza is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 
lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that evinacumab is a new active

No significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan PIP P/0105/2020 have been 
completed, in accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, after the entry into 
force of that Regulation.

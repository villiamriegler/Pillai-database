Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lonapegsomatropin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on serious hypersensitivity reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous 
reports including two cases with a close temporal relationship, adverse events unlikely to be attributed 
to disease or other treatments, clinically reasonable response to withdrawal and symptom-related 
acute therapy, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between lonapegsomatropin and anaphylactic reactions including angioedema is at least a 
reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of medicinal products 
containing lonapegsomatropin should be amended accordingly. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to include a warning on anaphylactic reactions including 
angioedema and add anaphylactic reactions (including angioedema) as an adverse drug reaction with a 
frequency ‘uncommon’. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lonapegsomatropin the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lonapegsomatropin is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

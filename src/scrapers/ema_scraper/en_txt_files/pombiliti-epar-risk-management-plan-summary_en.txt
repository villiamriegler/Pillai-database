Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Pombiliti. The RMP details important 
risks of Pombiliti, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Pombiliti’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pombiliti’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Pombiliti should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Pombiliti should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Pombiliti’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Pombiliti is a type of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) authorised for the treatment of 
late-onset Pompe disease in adults. Pombiliti is always used with another medicine called 
“Opfolda” (miglustat 65 mg hard capsules). Pombiliti is given as an intravenous infusion and 
Opfolda is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Pombiliti’s benefits can be found in Pombiliti’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pombiliti. 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Pombiliti, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Pombiliti’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size -- the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status -- the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Pombiliti, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Pombiliti is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Pombiliti are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Pombiliti. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylactic reactions with or without development of IgG and IgE antibodies 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Infusion-associated reactions (IARs) are a known issue with alglucosidase alfa (another 
ERT similar in structure to cipaglucosidase alfa), which in some instances have included 
life-threatening anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions. Serious and life-threatening 
anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock were reported in infantile- and 
late-onset patients during alglucosidase alfa infusions.  
In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat clinical development programme, IARs occurred in 
28.5% of subjects and were associated with 2.4% of all cipaglucosidase alfa infusions. The 
most frequent IARs (occurring in ≥ 2.0% of subjects) were headache, pyrexia, chills, 
dizziness, urticaria, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, nausea, pruritus, abdominal distension, abdominal 
pain, fatigue, flushing, and rash. The proportion of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated 
subjects who experienced IARs was similar for ERT-experienced subjects versus 
ERT-naïve subjects (28.2% versus 29.4%, respectively). The IARs were generally mild to 
moderate and were usually manageable with reduction or temporary stopping of infusion 
flow, premedications with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and/or paracetamol, and/or 
treatment with corticosteroids or antihistamines. Most IARs were medically managed such 
that subjects were able to continue treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa. Few IARs were 
serious. No life-threatening or fatal IARs were observed. 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis were reported in cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat clinical studies. One subject experienced an event reported as an 
anaphylactoid reaction, which occurred during the cipaglucosidase alfa infusion. Other 
potential hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events, reported in ≥ 2% of subjects, were asthma, 
chest discomfort, cough, dyspnoea, flushing, mouth ulceration, pruritus, rash, seasonal 
allergy, and urticaria. Most of the reported hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were 
nonserious and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. Serious 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events reported in 1 or more subjects included bradycardia, 
cough, dizziness, dyspnoea, flushing, hypotension, pharyngeal oedema, pruritus, urticaria 
and wheezing. No life-threatening or fatal cases of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis were 
observed. 
Infusion-associated reactions are more likely to occur with higher infusion rates. Pompe 
disease patients not previously treated with ERT or those who have a prior history of IARs, 
hypersensitivity/allergies, and/or anaphylaxis may be more at risk. Although no consistent 
association was demonstrated in clinical trials, patients who develop antibodies to 
cipaglucosidase alfa may be at a higher risk to experience IARs when cipaglucosidase alfa 
is re-administered.

Important potential risk: Immune complex related reaction 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Immune complex related reactions are an established safety risk with alglucosidase alfa 
(another ERT similar in structure to cipaglucosidase alfa), which in some instances have 
included severe skin reactions and chronic systemic reactions affecting the kidney and 
joints, such as severe inflammatory arthropathy (a severe disease of a joint, in which the 
joint is inflamed), and proteinuria (protein loss in urine) and nephrotic syndrome(a kidney 
disorder that causes the body to pass too much protein in the urine, resulting in swelling of 
lower limbs and generalised swelling). No events consistent with immune complex related 
reactions were identified in patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with 
miglustat in clinical trials; however, a potential class effect cannot be excluded as the 
formation of antibodies to cipaglucosidase alfa is well-established and such reactions have 
been reported with alglucosidase alfa. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Persistently high IgG antibody titres (ie, formation of a large number of antibodies to 
cipaglucosidase alfa) is a risk factor for experiencing an immune complex related reaction.  
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
  As stated in the SmPC (Section 4.4), patients should be monitored for clinical signs 
and symptoms of systemic immune complex related reactions; 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities: 
  Recommendations for managing immune complex related reactions are provided in the 
SmPC (Section 4.4), including discontinuation of Pombiliti in combination with 
miglustat and appropriate medical treatment.

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Adverse events may occur due to incorrect dose calculation, preparation, reconstitution, or 
administration of cipaglucosidase alfa in the home or clinic setting. It is expected and 
understood that the healthcare professionals administering cipaglucosidase alfa in the home 
setting are experienced in the management of the Pompe disease, as well as in the 
management of other ERTs. An overdose could place a patient at a higher risk for adverse 
events, while an underdose could result in lack of therapeutic effect. The risk for 
medication errors may be greater when the product is administered at the patient’s home 
rather than at a healthcare facility, and the risk for more serious or severe outcomes due to 
cipaglucosidase alfa-related adverse events may be greater when administered in this 
setting due to the lack of available emergency medical support.  
In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat clinical development programme, a total of 
80 subjects have received home infusion(s). Some IARs have been reported from clinical 
trials in association with home infusions, however, the majority of these have been 
nonserious and mild. No medication errors have occurred in the home setting. Nonetheless, 
as for other ERTs for which home infusion is possible, there is a possible risk of 
medication errors in the home infusion setting, and the consequences of such medication 
errors outside of a clinical setting could be more severe for the patient. 
Patients administered cipaglucosidase alfa in the home setting. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
  SmPC Sections 4.2 and 6.6; 
  PL Section 3; 
  As stated in the SmPC (Section 4.2), infusions should be supervised by healthcare 
professionals experienced in the management of Pompe disease; 
  As stated in the SmPC (Section 4.2), home infusions may be considered for patients 
who are tolerating their infusions well and have no history of moderate or severe IARs 
for a few months, and recommendations regarding a decision to move to home 
infusions are described in the SmPC (Section 4.2); 
  As stated in the SmPC (Section 4.4), for patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe 
allergic reactions in the home setting, if they continue on treatment, their next 
infusions must occur in a clinical setting equipped to deal with such medical 
emergencies; 
  The SmPC (Section 6.6) contains detailed instruction regarding preparation of the 
medicinal product (including calculating the dose, activities before reconstitution, 
reconstituting the lyophilised cake/powder, dilution and preparation of the infusion 
bag, and preparing for administration); 
  Recommendations for managing IARs including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic 
reactions are provided in the SmPC. 
Other routine risk minimisation measures beyond the Product Information: 
  Prescription only.

Study name 
Purpose of the study 
Prospective observational registry – A 
prospective observational registry of 
patients with Pompe disease 
The goal of the registry is to assess long-term safety and effectiveness 
of Pompe disease treatments in patients with late-onset Pompe disease 
(LOPD) and infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). Eligible patients 
include those who are currently receiving a medical therapy for Pompe 
disease (regardless of dose/dosing frequency) and those who are not 
currently receiving any medical therapy for Pompe disease. The 
objectives are to evaluate long-term safety of Pompe disease treatments 
through collection of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurring in patients with Pompe disease, including 
infusion-associated reactions (IARs), hypersensitivity reactions 
(including anaphylaxis), immune complex related reactions, and 
pregnancy exposures; to evaluate long-term real-world effectiveness of 
Pompe disease treatments through collection of functional outcomes 
assessments; to evaluate long-term real-world impact of Pompe disease 
treatments on quality of life (QOL) using patient reported outcome 
measures. This study will help to characterise the impact of the missing 
information of Use in pregnant and lactating women and Long-term 
use (> 24 months) on the safety profile of cipaglucosidase alfa and 
miglustat, and to help better characterise the important risks for 
cipaglucosidase alfa associated with IARs, hypersensitivity, 
anaphylaxis, immune complex related reactions, and medication errors 
in the home infusion setting.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for ambrisentan 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  ambrisentan.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of ambrisentan, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will 
be obtained about ambrisentan's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ambrisentan's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ambrisentan should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ambrisentan's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Ambrisentan is  authorised  for  the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  in  adult 
patients (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains ambrisentan as the active substance and it 
is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of ambrisentan ’s benefits can be found in ambrisentan’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s  webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ambrisentan-
mylan. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of ambrisentan, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  the  case  of  Ambrisentan  Mylan,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and is 
regularly  analysed,  including  in  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of ambrisentan is not yet available, it is listed 
under “Missing information” below.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of ambrisentan are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of ambrisentan. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but the definite causal association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine/);

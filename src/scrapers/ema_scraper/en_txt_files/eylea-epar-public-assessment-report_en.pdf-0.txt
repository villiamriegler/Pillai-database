a marketing authorisation to Eylea on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Aflibercept  as  described  in  its  SmPC  is  a  recombinant  fusion  protein  consisting  of  portions  of  human  VEGF 
receptor 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Aflibercept acts as a soluble 
decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than their natural receptors, and thereby can 
inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors.  
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF 
family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors 
for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface 
of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive 
activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular 
permeability.  PlGF  can  synergize  with  VEGF-A  in  these  processes,  and  is  also  known  to  promote  leucocyte 
infiltration and vascular inflammation. 
nAMD  is  characterised  by  leakage  of  blood  and  fluid  from  a  pathological  choroidal  neovascularisation  (CNV) 
that may cause retinal thickening or oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage.  
DME is a consequence of diabetic retinopathy and is characterised by increased vaso-permeability and damage 
to the retinal capillaries.  
Both pathology results in loss of visual acuity that, if left untreated can lead to blindness. The current standard 
of care (SOC) include treatment by anti-VEGF marketed products in Europe (EYLEA® – aflibercept; LUCENTIS® 
– ranibizumab and biosimilars; BEOVU® – broculizumab; VABYSMO® – faricimab), laser photocoagulation and 
vitrectomy. 
Currently, EYLEA (aflibercept) 40 mg/mL solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and in a vial are registered 
via Centralised Procedure (EMA/H/C/002392) and are indicated in adults for the treatment of: 
−  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
−  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO), 
−  visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME),  
−  visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). 
Although  anti-VEGF  therapy  is  the  standard-of-care  for  nAMD  and  DME,  the  patients,  physicians,  and 
caregivers’ burden remain consequent with regard to the long-term treatment and the related consequences 
related to the number of intravitreous (IVT) injections. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 8/235 
 
 
 
Therefore, the Applicant has developed a novel formulation (aflibercept 8mg) for IVT injections, which will have 
the potential to decrease the number of IVT injections and at the same time increase intervals of patient’s visits  
in adults for the treatment of nAMD and DME. 
2.2.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The development programme/compliance with guidance/scientific advice 
The purpose of this line extension application is to seek marketing approval of aflibercept with a new strength 
for some of the indications approved in EU (DME and nAMD). 
The clinical development program of aflibercept 8 mg consisted of three studies including two considered as 
pivotal and one supportive: 
•  Study PHOTON (21091, VGFTe-HD-DME-1934): an on-going (with data through Week 60), multi-center, 
randomized, double-masked, active-controlled Phase 2/3 study in participants with DME.  
•  Study PULSAR (20968): an on-going (with data through Week 60), multi-center, randomized, double-
masked, active-controlled Phase 3 study in participants with nAMD.  
•  Study CANDELA (21086, VGFTe (HD)-AMD-1905): completed (supportive study), multi-center, 
randomized, single-masked, active-controlled Phase 2 study in participants with nAMD.  
The MAH obtained a scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/277944/2019) discussed throughout this report. 
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The manufacturing and testing of EYLEA are conducted in accordance with the provisions of current Good 
Manufacturing and Clinical Practices.

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant applied for a line extension application to the existing Eylea marketing authorisation for a new 
aflibercept strength of 114.3 mg/mL in a vial. Aflibercept solution for injection 114.3 mg/mL is a new 
formulation with the same active substance as in the currently approved finished product Aflibercept solution 
for injection 40 mg/mL.  
The finished product is presented as a solution for intravitreous administration containing 114.3 mg/mL of 
aflibercept as active substance. Other ingredients are: arginine hydrochloride, histidine hydrochloride 
monohydrate, histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and water for injections (WfI). 
1 ml solution for injection contains 114.3 mg aflibercept. Each vial contains 30.1 mg aflibercept in 0.263 ml 
solution. This provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 0.07 ml containing 8 mg aflibercept. 
The product is available in Type I glass vial, stoppered with an elastomeric stopper, and sealed with an 
aluminium seal cap.  
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
Aflibercept is a recombinant homodimeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 115,000 
Daltons. This fusion protein consists of two identical polypeptide chains, each comprising the second Ig 
domain of the human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 and the third Ig domain of the 
human VEGF receptor 2, with both polypeptide chains fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The activities of manufacturing and testing of Aflibercept FDS solution 114.3 mg/mL are conducted by 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Rensselaer (USA). The manufacturing and testing sites are supported by 
valid GMP documentation.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Aflibercept formulated active substance (FDS) manufacturing process begins with the thawing and pooling of 
Aflibercept DSI, which is then further purified through chromatography and concentrated by 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF). The final concentrated pool (FCP) is then adjusted buffers to produce FDS 
with a target protein concentration of 114.3 mg/mL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 10/235 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Description of FDS manufacturing process and process controls are appropriately detailed and consistent with 
information provided in other sections of the dossier . The FDS batch definition and scale are given.  
It is stated that reprocessing is not part of the standard manufacturing process and can only occur under 
certain circumstances. The conditions where reprocessing would apply are satisfactorily described.  
Control of critical steps 
The in-process control (IPC) program developed for FDS manufacturing process is mainly based on that was 
registered for DSI manufacturing process. The Applicant clarified that the differences noted in the IPC 
Program classification reflect a change of historical approach and application of a new control strategy. The 
primary change is in terminology. Confirmation was given that there is no impact to the treatment of 
potential out of trend/specification. The justification provided is acceptable. 
In addition, for both DSI and FDS manufacturing processes, certain parameters were classified as non-critical 
attributes for in-process samples although these attributes satisfy the critical attribute definition . The 
Applicant explained that  these in-process tests are classified as non-critical in-process controls (IPC), and 
are performed during processing and that adequate control is maintained. Any IPC excursion will lead to an 
investigation and appropriate corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) will be taken. Excursions that pertain 
to safety will lead to batch rejection. Furthermore, it was reminded that release testing of these parameter is 
classified as a critical quality attribute (CQA) . Based on the justification provided, the proposed classification  
is considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the FDS manufacturing process are given. Apart from chromatography resin and 
membrane filter, all raw materials are chemical and compendial grade. Additionally, a risk assessment was 
performed with regards to potential extractables and leachables that could be released in the process. No 
compounds of toxicological concern originated from the FDS manufacturing process were identified. 
Process validation 
Consecutive PPQ lots were successfully produced. The capability of the process to operate consistently was 
demonstrated through control and monitoring of operational and process performance parameters, as well as 
conformance to specifications. A supplemental validation was thereafter performed to take into account late 
process changes for the final purification step . The unit operation has been confirmed to remain in the 
validated state. 
Levels of specific residual impurities were demonstrated to be reduced to acceptably low levels in the FDS. 
The established process hold times for routine manufacturing are supported by suitable data, using a 
combination of microbial control studies and chemical stability studies.  
Reprocessing is not routinely performed as part of the DS manufacturing process but repetition of the 
filtration step can occur . Reprocessing will be validated under concurrent validation protocol at commercial 
scale.  
A maximum lifetime for chromatography resin was proposed. Data have been compiled and are provided with 
the response. The claim resin lifetime is appropriately demonstrated.  
An overview of the studies which contribute to the development of the manufacturing process was provided. 
Comparability studies were performed to evaluate process optimisations made during development of 
Aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL. Process changes were limited to the final purification and the concentration 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 11/235 
 
 
and diafiltration (UF/DF) steps. A summary of comparability assessment between historical and optimised 
process was presented.   
Characterisation 
A comprehensive set of state-of-the-art methods was applied to demonstrate that aflibercept solution 114.3 
mg/mL has the expected structure and function. Characterisation studies were conducted on three aflibercept 
FDS lots. Overall, there is a high level of conformance and quality observed among aflibercept lots. 
As no new impurities were introduced during the manufacture of FDS when compared to DSI, process 
validation originally performed on DSI that demonstrated the capability of the DSI manufacturing process to 
clear process-related impurities is still valid. Regarding product-related impurities, a comprehensive control 
strategy for size and charge variants is in place to ensure process consistency through the in-process control 
and monitoring, release, and stability testing programs. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The proposed FDS specifications include testing for appearance , pH, protein and polysorbate contents, 
osmolality, identity, potency, charge variants, purity, and microbial contaminants. 
The FDS release and end-of-shelf-life acceptance criteria are supported by process capability as well as 
clinical experience or were established based on process capability and levels evaluated during formulation 
robustness studies or were leveraged from previously established acceptance criteria. In addition, some 
acceptance criteria were based on historical experience or based on regulatory safety criteria for intraocular 
fluids, process capability, and is in alignment with the clinical specification. The proposed specifications are 
acceptable. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical methods were satisfactorily validated as per ICH QR2 requirements. In some cases, data 
derived from the initial validation with aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL was used to support suitability of 
methods for aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL. Supplemental validation was performed for some parameters 
to demonstrate that differences in protein concentration and formulation matrices does not impact the 
results. This information provided is adequate. 
Batch analysis  
Batch analysis results have been provided for several batches representative of the intended commercial 
process (including batches from optimised process). Results confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
batches, indicating that the process is under control.  
Reference standards 
The Applicant established appropriately characterised in-house primary and working reference materials, 
prepared from lots representative of production (either active substance 40 mg/mL or FDS 114.3 mg/mL). 
Working reference material used in the testing of production lots was calibrated against the primary reference 
material. Documentation of the qualification, storage conditions and stability program of primary and working 
reference materials was provided. Protocol for qualification of future primary and working reference materials 
was also described.

Container closure system 
Aflibercept FDS is stored and shipped in specified bottles. The components materials comply with relevant 
European requirements. The container closure system was selected to pose low risk for extractables and 
leachables. Compatibility of the container with the formulated active substance is demonstrated through 
stability studies. The information provided is adequate and sufficient. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The proposed shelf-life and storage conditions for aflibercept formulated active substance solution 114.3 
mg/mL is based on several batches for which manufacture and storage are representative of the 
manufacturing scale of production . Updated stability data have been provided . Results from the long-term 
studies met the acceptance criteria at all available time points, and no meaningful changes were observed.  
Under accelerated and stress stability conditions, some degradations were observed, confirming that the 
analytical methods selected are able to detect significant changes in the quality of the product.  The 
photostability study highlight that FDS light exposure should be limited during storage.  
FDS samples were demonstrated stable after several cycles of freezing and thawing. 
Based on updated data provided, the proposed shelf-life, and storage conditions when protected from light, 
for aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL can be granted. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL is supplied as a solution in a vial for intravitreous administration. Each vial has a 
minimum extractable volume to allow delivering a dose of 0.07 mL (8 mg). The finished product contains no 
preservatives and is for single use only. The secondary packaging includes a filter needle for aspiration of the 
aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL finished product. 
The commercial formulation is an aqueous solution containing 114.3 mg/mL aflibercept, histidine, pH 5.8, 
sucrose, arginine monohydrochloride , and polysorbate 20. This formulation was selected based on screening 
studies that demonstrate the formulation effectively stabilises liquid finished product during long-term 
storage at 2 – 8 °C . 
The development of the manufacturing process was based on technical transfer documentation, previous 
experience with filling aflibercept, as well as development and process parameters studies. During 
development, the manufacturing process was transferred from the clinical site to the commercial site 
accompanied by additional changes. An analytical comparability exercise was performed - including in-
process controls, release testing, extended characterisation data, and long-term, accelerated, and stress 
stability studies – the results showed the lots filled at both manufacturing sites have comparable quality 
profile.  
Aflibercept finished product contains no preservatives. The microbiological quality complies with the European 
requirements for sterile products and is ensured by a combination of various measures - sterile product-
contact components, sterile in-line filtration, environmental and media monitoring - and is confirmed by 
microbiological IPC testing as well as sterility release testing.

The finished product, aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL in a vial, is intended to be administered intravitreally. 
Studies were performed to assess compatibility of the finished product with the components that may be 
used for dose preparation and administration(18 gauge filter needle and 30 gauge administration needle). 
Physicochemical stability of the Aflibercept finished product was demonstrated under simulated in-use 
conditions. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Bayer AG (Germany) is responsible for EU batch certification. The name, address, and responsibility of each 
manufacturer and facility involved in the manufacturing and testing of the finished product were given. GMP 
documentation (QP declaration and GMP certificates) presented are suitable. The sites responsible to perform 
each release test have been stated.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process is standard and starts with the thawing of formulated active 
substance. The finished product solution is then pooled and mixed, pre-filtrated, and sterilised by filtration 
immediately prior to filling. The vials are stoppered, crimped and a  visual inspection is performed before 
labelling and secondary packaging.  
The hold/storage times and batch size were defined.  
Process controls 
For each manufacturing step, in-process controls were determined and classified. Operating ranges were 
established based on product knowledge and process experience. Information given has been adequately 
harmonised.   
Process validation 
Validation of the Aflibercept finished product manufacturing process is based on the analysis of consecutive 
PPQ batches. The validation studies included control of process parameters and IPCs, and control of quality 
attributes. The results met the acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the manufacturing process remains 
consistent.  
Further supportive validation studies were performed. Process hold times were validated. It was confirmed 
that validation of the aseptic processing is conducted periodically. The information provided in this section 
was acceptable. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The proposed finished product specifications include testing for appearance , pH, protein, identity, potency, 
isoaspartate content, charge variants, purity, sterility, endotoxins and extractable volume. 
The Applicant agreed to tighten some specifications to better reflect the actual data. Other acceptance criteria 
are considered appropriately justified.  
The manufacturing process has been evaluated for nitrosamines risk, based on risk factors for biologicals. 
Confirmation that the overall manufacturing process presents low risk of nitrosamine impurities was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 14/235 
 
 
No additional testing is considered necessary. Similarly, the risk for the presence of elemental impurities in 
aflibercept finished product was evaluated (ICH Q3D) and is considered low. Therefore, no additional controls 
for elemental impurities in the manufacture or storage of aflibercept are required. This is acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Analytical results of several finished product batches manufactured at the commercial site were provided, 
alongside representative clinical batches manufactured at previous manufacturing site. All results met the 
acceptance criteria and showed consistency.  
Batch information including the status, manufacturing date, batch size and genealogy, description, 
manufacturing site, and study usage was adequately presented.  
Container closure system 
The primary packaging consists of a vial (type I glass) with a grey rubber stopper sealed with an aluminium 
cap with white lid. The names of the suppliers have been included in the dossier as requested.   
The choice of the container closure system is in line with pharmaceutical standards and the components 
comply with pharmacopeia requirements. To avoid potential mix-up between Eylea 40 mg/mL and Eylea 
114.3 mg/mL, confirmation was given that different colour of cap is used between presentations. For Eylea 
114.3 mg/mL the flip cap is white and for Eylea 40 mg/mL the flip cap is blue. The information on the specific 
colour for each strength is provided in the Product Information. Adequate protection from microbial 
contamination is verified via container closure integrity testing. The containers proposed for routine storage 
are those which have been used in the stability studies supporting the shelf life. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 24 months when stored at 2 °C-8 °C is claimed for the finished product. 
Several Aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL finished product batches were manufactured at the clinical and commercial 
site and placed into the stability monitoring programs. As comparability were demonstrated between clinical 
materials and commercial batches, stability data derived from the clinical site are considered representative 
of the commercial process. The quality of the finished product clinical and PPQ batches placed into the 
stability program is monitored using analytical test procedures, which are similar to release testing. Container 
closure integrity test (CCIT) and sterility of the product was monitored to demonstrate that the container 
closure integrity remained intact throughout the duration of the studies. 
The proposed shelf-life and storage conditions of 24 months at 2 °C-8 °C is based on  real-time, real 
conditions stability data available for three batches. All results are within specification without any significant 
degradation trend. 
Stability data obtained from accelerated (25 °C/60% RH) and stressed (37 °C) storage conditions were also 
presented as supportive data. Under these conditions, changes to purity levels were observed.  
The photostability analysis indicates that the finished product is photosensitive and should be protected from 
light during storage. The secondary packaging designated for use with the finished product container closure 
system offers sufficient protection from light exposure. 
In summary, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2 °C-8 °C, protected from light, for Aflibercept solution 
114.3 mg/mL in vial is supported.

2.3.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s)  
In addition to the registration of a new aflibercept formulation of 114.3 mg/mL solution in a vial, a post 
approval change management protocol (PACMP) is proposed for the pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation of 
the new formulation. 
The PACMP describes the process differences between the vial and the PFS and the studies that will be 
performed in support of the PFS presentation, including process validation and analytical comparability 
studies between Aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL finished product in PFS and in vials.  
The justification for the target fill volume owas considered acceptable. 
The process validation protocol is designed to qualify the proposed manufacturing sites for aseptic filling of 
Aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL in prefilled syringes, and for labelling, assembling, blistering, outer surface 
sterilization and final packaging. Validation of the manufacturing process will be conducted on consecutive 
batches. The list of operating parameters and additional testing that will be performed to demonstrate that 
the manufacturing process is controlled and consistent has been appropriately detailed.  
In addition to the process validation, additional validation/qualification activities will be conducted.  
The comparability study follows the principles outlined in ICH Q5E “Comparability of Biotechnological/ 
Biological Products Subject to Changes in their Manufacturing Process” and will compare data of PFS batches 
with data of vials,. A thorough analytical comparison including testing against the product specification, 
stability testing and extended characterisation is planned. Evaluation of all analytical test results is 
appropriately described and will be supported by provision of statistical analysis and representative 
chromatograms where applicable.  
Overall, the process validation and analytical comparability studies that will be performed as part of PACMP is 
comprehensive. The PACMP is thus considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Aflibercept intermediate (DSI) is the same as for the authorised Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL. The 
manufacturing operations performed at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to obtain Aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL 
formulated active substance are chromatography and UF/DF. These steps are not dedicated to 
remove/inactivate virus. Additionally, no materials with viral safety concern are introduced at this stage of 
the process. 
Based on these considerations, adventitious agents safety evaluation that was performed for Aflibercept 
intermediate (DSI) remains valid and no new assessment is deemed necessary.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Applicant applied for a line extension application to the existing Eylea marketing authorisation for a new 
aflibercept strength of 114.3 mg/mL with a new formulation, in a vial. Further, this extension application is 
grouped with a Type II variation for a PACMP for the Aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL in a prefilled syringe.  
The Module 3 dossier presented is of good quality. Information on development, manufacture and control of 
Aflibercept 114.3 mg/mL solution is comprehensive and overall acceptable. No major concern has been 
identified. Some other concerns were raised and have been satisfactorily addressed.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Eylea 114.3 mg/mL is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions as defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing relevant guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, this line extension application for Eylea to add a new 
strength of 114.3 mg/mL is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Extensive pharmacological program was conducted to obtain MA for aflibercept 2mg. In order to validate the 
development of the new aflibercept 8 mg dose strength, a primary in vivo pharmacology study in a chronic 
retinal  neovascularization  (RNV)  model  in  rabbits  was  conducted.  No  additional  primary  or  secondary 
pharmacology studies were conducted with the new aflibercept 8 mg formulation. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted an additional in vivo study in a chronic retinal neovascularization model in rabbits, in 
order to validate the development of the new aflibercept 8 mg dose strength. 
A single IVT dose of aflibercept was able to completely block retinal vascular leak and cause regression of 
pathological neovascularization in all treated animals beginning at 1 week following injection and persisting 
for 4 (0.5 mg group) or 6 (2 mg group) weeks. Compared to the 0.5 mg dose, the number of treated eyes in 
which leak was completely blocked was significantly greater in the 2mg dose group at all sampling times up 
to 18-weeks post-dosing. Overall, these results support the development of the new aflibercept 8 mg dose 
strength. 
2.4.3.  Toxicology  
In addition to the toxicity studies conducted to support the authorized aflibercept 2 mg formulation, the MAH 
has  conducted  two  GLP-compliant  IVT  bridging  studies  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  with  high  concentration 
formulation to support marketing authorization of aflibercept 8 mg: a 9-week or 6-month study with 3 different 
formulations (VGFT-TX-18169) and a 3-month study with aflibercept to support specification. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  additional  preclinical  PK  studies  were  conducted  with  the  high  concentration  formulation.  Results  of  the 
toxicokinetic  evaluation  of  the  two  new  IVT  bridging  studies  in  monkeys  utilizing  the  new  aflibercept  8  mg 
formulation (Module 4.2.3.2, VGFT-TX- 18169 and VGFT-TX-20170) do not raise any concerns. A bioanalytical 
method  to  detect  anti-VEGF  Trap  antibodies  in  monkey  serum  samples  has  been  developed  and  validated 
(Report VGFT-AV-12112-VA-01) using electrochemiluminescence in a bridging assay format. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 17/235 
 
 
 
Study  VGFT-TX-18169,  did  not  identify  any  new  toxicity  finding  in  comparison  with  study  VGFT-TX-05011 
(submitted for aflibercept 2 mg MA approval). As such, an acute, transient, generally mild, dose-related anterior 
segment  inflammatory  response  was  generally  reported  at  ophthalmological  examination  and  was  not 
associated with any treatment-related finding at ERG, ocular imaging, and microscopic evaluations. Microscopic 
examination reported erosion and/or ulceration and squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium in the 
nasal  turbinates  with  evidence  of  ongoing  reversibility  at  the  end  of  recovery  period.  Whereas  squamous 
metaplasia  was  not  considered  as  adverse,  a  NOAEL  could  not  be  determined  considering  epithelial  erosion 
and/or ulceration in the nasal turbinates. Those nasal turbinates findings had been identified previously within 
studies supporting the currently approved formulation with a NOAEL of 0.5 mg/eye after 8-month treatment 
(3.3-fold  the  predicted  exposure  in  patients  treated  with  the  new  formulation).  At  the  LOAEL  of  4  mg/eye 
identified  in  the  current  study,  systemic  exposure  was  80-fold  (Cmax)  and  67-fold  (AUC)  that  predicted  in 
patients. 
Study  VGFT-TX-20170  in  male  cynomolgus,  which  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  and  determine  the 
toxicokinetics of VEGF-Trap formulations containing different amounts of impurities (formulation 1 and 2) to 
support specification has highlighted similar results for both dose groups. In both groups, animals were dosed 
at  5.6  mg/eye.  Both  formulations  were  well  tolerated  during  the  whole  study  and  no  effect  on  clinical 
observations, body weights, body weight change, qualitative food consumption, IOP, ocular photography, FA, 
ERG, VEPs, macroscopic findings, or clear test article-related changes in organ weight parameters were noticed. 
Whereas  erosion  and/or  ulceration  and  squamous  metaplasia  of  the  respiratory  epithelium  in  the  nasal 
turbinates, previously observed in studies supporting the currently approved formulation (8 months IVT study 
VGFT-TX-05011)  and  also  in  study  VGFT-TX-18169,  did  not  affect  any  animal  during  the  full  course  of  the 
study. Absence of systemic findings at the nasal turbinates level was considered to be related to the lower dose 
volume of 40 µL used in study VGF-TX-20170 vs. 50 µL used in studies VGFT-TX-18169 and VGFT-TX-05011. 
Since volume vitreous ratio between cynomolgus and human is equals to 2, no post-injection reflux is expected 
in clinics at a dose of 8 mg with an injection volume of 80 µL. At ophthalmic examination, sporadic instances 
of mild (0.5 to 1+) aqueous cell or flare and more frequent instances of mild (0.5 to 1+) vitreous cell were 
observed in comparison with but resolved at recovery phase. Based on the results of study VGF-TX-20170, the 
NOAEL is 5.6 mg/eye with systemic exposures (141 and 131-fold Cmax; 112 and 105-fold AUC) higher than 
those predicted in patients. 
To support the current line extension to a novel drug product delivering a higher dose of aflibercept, the MAH 
has conducted a review of the available relevant studies to assess any potential risk on fertility and embryo-
fetal development. Exposure ratios were also revised taking into consideration the exposure levels estimated 
on treatment weeks 8-12 from a popPK model after one IVT injection of 8  mg aflibercept every 4 weeks in 
patients with nAMD or DME (mean Cmax of 0.154 µg/mL, mean AUC0-28d of 48.72 µg.h/mL). 
Reversible effects shown on menstrual cycle, female hormone levels and sperm parameters were reported at 
all dose levels in the 6-month intravenous monkey study. Due to the increase in systemic exposure with the 
new  8  mg  formulation  compared  to  the  approved  2  mg  formulations,  the  exposure  ratio  at  the  LOAEL  of  3 
mg/kg decreased from 1500-fold to 91-fold. This is still considerable, however this should also be interpreted 
in relation to the absence of safety margin. The wording proposed for fertility data in SPC section 5.3 is identical 
to that approved for the approved 2 mg formulation with revised exposure ratios; this is acceptable. However, 
the deletion of the fertility subsection in SPC 4.6 was not endorsed. A wording similar to that approved for the 
2 mg formulation was included but adapted to account for the increase in systemic exposure level and to report 
the absence of human data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 18/235 
 
 
Embryo-fetal development toxicity studies were conducted in rabbits after either intravenous (3-60 mg/kg) or 
subcutaneous (0.1-1 mg/kg) administration. In the subcutaneous study, a teratogenic effect was reported at 
all doses. Taking into account the exposure levels estimated in patients on treatment weeks 8-12 from a popPK 
model, it is concluded that malformations were seen in rabbits from exposure levels below those reached at 
the recommended human dose (exposure ratio for free aflibercept were 1.7 and 0.89 based on Cmax and AUC, 
respectively, at the LOAEL). In view of the absence of safety margin for embryo-fetal development with this 
new formulation, and considering available clinical safety data, the wording for SPC 4.6 pregnancy subsection 
was  adapted.  In  relation  to  this  teratogenic  liability,  the  MAH  has  provided  acceptable  justification  that 
contraception of male patients is not required since the estimated exposure of their female partners would be 
negligible compared to that of treated patients and not likely to cause VEGF inhibition. In addition, a 4-month 
post-treatment contraception period is recommended for female patients based on the time required for free 
aflibercept concentration in plasma to reach LLOQ according to the popPK model with an additional buffer of 1 
month. 
Regarding ERA, the applicant has acknowledged that the new dose strength may potentially increase the 
emission of aflibercept into the environment. Nevertheless, aflibercept is a monoclonal antibody and is 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.4.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical part of the submission was adequate.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical development program of aflibercept consists of two pivotal studies (PULSAR and PHOTON studies) 
and a third study (CANDELA study) considered as supportive depicted in Table 1.

2.5.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.1.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Based on Population PK analysis, participants in the combined nAMD and DME dense PK substudy population 
who  received  an  initial  dose  of  2  mg  or  8  mg  aflibercept  IVT  had  a  Population  PK  post-hoc  estimated  free 
aflibercept  in  plasma  median  tmax  of  2.16  days  and  2.89  days,  respectively.  The  attainment  of  tmax  for 
adjusted  bound  aflibercept  in  plasma  was  slower  when  compared  to  free  aflibercept.  The  simulated  median 
tmax was 13.7 days and 15.8 days for the 2 mg and 8 mg IVT aflibercept treatments, respectively. 
Based on the Population PK analysis, the bioavailability of free aflibercept following intravitreal administration 
is estimated to be approximately 72%. 
Distribution 
Based on the Population PK analysis, the total volume of distribution of free aflibercept after IV administration 
is estimated to be approximately 7 L. 
Elimination 
•  Systemic elimination 
Like most therapeutic proteins, the large molecular weight of aflibercept (approximately 115 kDa) is expected 
to preclude elimination via the kidney, and its metabolism is expected to be limited to proteolytic catabolism 
to small peptides and individual amino acids. Following initial monthly IVT dose, the concentration-time profile 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 21/235 
 
 
  
 
 
of  free  aflibercept  in  plasma  is  characterized  by  an  initial  phase  of  increasing  concentrations  as  the  drug  is 
absorbed  from  the  ocular  space  into  the  systemic  circulation,  followed  by  a  mono-exponential  elimination 
phase. The Population PK predicted median time for free aflibercept concentrations in plasma to reach LLOQ 
following 2 mg IVT aflibercept is 1.5 weeks compared to 3.5 weeks for HD aflibercept. 
•  Ocular elimination 
Based on the Population PK analysis, HD aflibercept was estimated to have a 34% slower clearance from the 
ocular compartment compared to the lower IVT doses of aflibercept (≤ 4 mg doses). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
PK of free aflibercept appears to be greater than dose proportional, and adjusted bound aflibercept less than 
dose proportional consistent with IV dose PK already known. There appears to be little accumulation of free 
aflibercept, and up to 2.2 fold accumulation of bound aflibercept. 
Special populations 
This new presentation of aflibercept was intended for two different target populations, patients with nAMD and 
DME.  Although  not  a  statistically  significant  covariate  in  the  population  PK  model,  the  effects  of  disease 
population on systemic exposures to free and adjusted bound aflibercept were evaluated. PK in patients with 
nAMD and DME were slightly differing, but disease population was not a statistically significant covariate in the 
population PK model. 
Amongst  the  covariates  evaluated  in  the  Population  PK  analysis,  body  weight  was  the  covariate  with  the 
greatest impact on systemic exposures to free and adjusted bound aflibercept. For participants in the lowest 
quintile of body weight (38.1 kg to 64.5 kg), the predicted impact on systemic exposures (Cmax and AUCtau) 
was  modest,  with  27%  to  39%  higher  exposures  to  free  aflibercept  and  25%  to  27%  higher  exposures  to 
adjusted bound aflibercept when compared to the reference body weight range (73.5 to 83.5 kg). The effects 
of other covariates (age, albumin, disease population, and race, which included evaluation of Japanese race) 
on systemic exposures (Cmax, AUCtau) to free and adjusted bound aflibercept were small (<25% increase in 
exposure for covariate subgroups relative to the reference group), with several of these other covariate effects 
correlating with a consistent trend in body weight.  
No dosage adjustments of HD aflibercept are warranted based on the assessed covariates. Mild to severe renal 
impairment also had a small impact on free aflibercept systemic exposures, as the increase in free aflibercept 
Cmax and AUCtau in these participants was less than approximately 28% compared to participants with normal 
renal  function.  Adjusted  bound  aflibercept  systemic  exposures  in  participants  with  mild  to  severe  renal 
impairment ranged from 13% to 39% higher compared to participants with normal renal function. Here too, 
the  perceived  impact  of  renal  impairment  is  best  explained  by  the  associated  decrease  in  body  weight  with 
increasing renal impairment. Mild hepatic impairment had no effect on systemic exposures to free and adjusted 
bound aflibercept. No dosage adjustments of aflibercept are warranted for these populations.

2.5.1.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Concentration effect relationship 
As the IVT dose increased from 2 mg of aflibercept to 8 mg of HD aflibercept, no further increase in PD effect 
(decrease in CRT) was observed 4 weeks after each initial q4w dose through 12 weeks, in either the nAMD or 
DME population. Despite 2 mg of aflibercept and 8 mg of HD aflibercept having similar PD effect during the 
initial q4w dosing period, the 8 mg HD aflibercept dose provided a longer duration of pharmacological effect in 
the maintenance phase compared to 2 mg aflibercept. 
In nAMD participants, the small fluctuations in CRT or CST during a maintenance dosing interval attenuated 
over time for all dosing regimens, with only minor numerical differences observed between treatment groups. 
For DME participants, a greater reduction in CRT was observed from weeks 16 to 20 for 2q8 compared to both 
HD  aflibercept  regimens  (HDq12  and  HDq16).  This  is  attributable  to  a  difference  in  the  number  of  doses 
administered during this time period, with the 2q8 regimen receiving 2 additional initial q4w doses at weeks 
12 and 16 compared to the HD aflibercept regimens which received their last initial q4w dose at week 8. These 
differences in CRT did not translate into any meaningful difference in mean BCVA response. The fluctuations in 
CRT response over the course of a maintenance dosing interval attenuated over time for all dosing regimens. 
For participants with nAMD or DME, the HDq12 and HDq16 regimens provided rapid and durable response in 
CRT  and  BCVA  over  48  weeks  of  treatment,  with  the  majority  of  participants  maintaining  their  randomized 
HDq12 (79% nAMD; 91% DME) and HDq16 (77% nAMD; 89% DME) treatment regimens, without the need for 
DRM. 
Ocular clearance of free aflibercept and baseline CRT were identified as significant covariates contributing to 
the need for DRM. Higher ocular clearance of free aflibercept and higher baseline CRT (indicative of more severe 
disease) were associated with an increased rate of DRM.  
The slower ocular clearance for HD aflibercept, attributable to a HD drug product effect, is estimated to result 
in a 20.6% lower rate of DRM compared to HD aflibercept if the same ocular clearance was observed as the 2 
mg aflibercept. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and PD 
The presented PopPK and E-R models are developed to provide context on the generated results and are used 
primarily for descriptive purposes, not to simulate untested scenario, but also in NC, pregnancy and toxicology 
discussions.  
Concerning  elimination,  the  longer  duration  of  systemic  exposure  to  free  aflibercept  for  HD  aflibercept  is 
attributed to not only a higher administered dose and nonlinear systemic target mediated elimination but also 
to a 34% slower ocular clearance of free aflibercept. 
Simulations of the population PK model showed that slower ocular clearance of the HD aflibercept drug product 
resulted  in maintained ocular concentrations of free aflibercept above a threshold for 6 weeks longer with 8 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 23/235 
 
 
 
mg aflibercept compared to 2 mg aflibercept. In consequence, the HD formulation can be expected to provide 
a 6 weeks longer duration of efficacy. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Distribution, elimination from the ocular compartment after IVT, overall elimination, and effect of high dose 
were  well  characterised.  No  adaptation  of  dose  for  special  populations  for  PK  reasons  or  immunogenicity 
reasons are foreseen. MSOEG was of advice that the VPCs showed enough discrepancies to ask for an update 
of the model, and eventual support of the SmPC section 5.2 by the NCAs results instead of the population PKPD 
modelling, this was applied.  
2.5.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.4.1.  Main studies 
PULSAR Study – 20968 
Methods 
Study design 
This phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study will investigate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of IVT administration of aflibercept 8 mg (HD) versus aflibercept 2 mg in participants 
with treatment-naïve nAMD. 
The study consists of a screening/baseline period, followed by a treatment period with duration of 92 weeks, 
and an end of study visit at Week 96. An extension of the study is planned starting Week 96. 
Subjects with nAMD were randomized to receive IVT injections in the study eye of aflibercept high-dosed (HD) 
or aflibercept 2 mg in 3 parallel treatment groups (1:1:1 ratio): 
  • 
  • 
2q8: aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals. 
HDq12: aflibercept 8 mg administered every 12 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals. 
Participants in this group can move to q8 dosing regimen at Weeks 16 or 20, or up to q16 dosing regimen at 
week 52 according to pre-specified criteria. 
  • 
HDq16: aflibercept 8 mg administered every 16 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals. 
Participants in this group can move to q8 dosing regimen at Weeks 16 or 20, to q12 dosing regimen at Week 24, 
or up to q20 dosing regimen at week 52 according to pre-specified criteria.

5. Presence of IRF and/or SRF affecting the central subfield of the study eye on OCT. The central subfield is 
defined as a circle with diameter 1 mm, centered on the fovea. 
Key exclusion criteria 
1. Causes of CNV other than nAMD in the study eye  
2. Total lesion size >12 disc areas (30.5 mm2, including blood, scars, and neovascularization) as assessed by 
FA in the study eye. 
3. Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as IOP > 25 mmHg despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication) in 
the study eye 
4. Subretinal hemorrhage in the study eye ≥ 50% of the total lesion area, or if the blood under the fovea was 
≥ 1 disc areas in size 
5. Prior treatment of the study eye with anti-angiogenic drugs at any time 
6. Uncontrolled blood pressure (defined as systolic > 160 mm Hg or diastolic > 95 mm Hg) 
7. History or clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or any retinal vascular disease 
other than nAMD in either eye.  
The comparator choice in naïve patients with nAMD was supported by the CHMP scientific advice. The chosen 
study population and related exams all along the study mimics the one from the randomised phase III VIEW1 
and 2, which were the basis for the approval of aflibercept in nAMD patients and are in line with registrational 
studies for Eylea, therefore deemed acceptable. 
Treatments 
In PULSAR study, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive monotherapy with either 2 mg aflibercept 
(administered every 8 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals) or aflibercept 8 mg administered 
every 12 or 16 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals as described in Table 2. Participants in the 
HD groups (HDq12 and HDq16) could benefit from a dose regimen modification and receive injections with a 
q8 dosing regimen at Weeks 16 or 20, or q12 dosing regimen (only for HDq16 treatment group) at Week 24, 
or up to or up to q16 (HDq12 group), q20 (HDq16 group) dosing regimen at week 52, according to pre-specified 
criteria listed in Table 3.

Each vial was for single eye use only. Medical devices used in this study include both devices that help prepare 
and  deliver  the  study  treatment  (study  drug  and  comparator),  as  well  as  devices  that  are  used  to  gather 
additional clinical data. The devices were CE marked (or FDA cleared) according to the regulatory requirements 
specific for the country/region where the study site was located.

Compared to the approved formulation of aflibercept 2mg, the dose tested is 4 times higher. It is to note that 
it is not clear why the 4 mg dose was not further investigated.  
Permitted concomitant treatments:  
Participants may not receive any standard or investigational agents for treatment of their nAMD in the study 
eye other than IVT aflibercept as specified in this protocol until they have completed the end of study/early 
termination  visit  assessments.  This  includes  medications  administered  locally  (e.g.,  IVT,  by  juxtascleral  or 
periorbital routes), as well as those administered systemically with the intent of treating the fellow eye.

Any medication considered necessary for the participant’s welfare, and that is not expected to interfere with 
the evaluation of the study intervention, may be given at the discretion of the investigator. 
Any medication or vaccine (including any sedation, anesthesia, eye drops used for the study procedures, blood-
derived  products,  prescription  or  over-the-counter  medicines,  probiotics,  vitamins,  and  herbal  supplements) 
that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the study was to be recorded. 
If a pre-treatment concomitant medication is administered in the study eye before injection (e.g., antibiotic, 
topical anesthetic), it must be administered for sham procedures as well. 
Dose delays or modifications: Assessments for dose regimen modification is to be performed in all participants 
at all visits starting from Week 16. Based on these assessments, participants in the HD groups may have their 
treatment intervals shortened or extended. The minimum interval between injections will be 8 weeks, which is 
considered  a  rescue  regimen  for  participants  randomized  to  HD  groups  who  are  unable  to  tolerate  a  dosing 
interval greater than every 8 weeks. Participants in the aflibercept 2 mg group will remain on fixed q8 dosing 
throughout the study until the end of masked study visit at Week 96 (i.e., will not have modifications of their 
treatment intervals regardless of the outcomes of the dose regimen modification assessments). 
Treatment was to be discontinued in patients if any of the following reasons applied (but were not limited to): 
• Relevant laboratory abnormality or SAEs, if the sponsor or investigator sees this as medical reason to warrant 
withdrawal. 
• AE (ocular or nonocular) that, from the participant’s or the investigator’s view, is potent enough to require 
withdrawal from the study. The investigator must notify the sponsor immediately if a participant is withdrawn 
because of an AE/SAE. 
• At the discretion of the treating investigator. The development of conditions, which would have prevented a 
participant’s entry into the study according to the selection criteria, is no reason per se for withdrawal. However, 
the withdrawal in such cases remains at the discretion of the treating investigator. 
•  Decision  by  the  investigator  or  sponsor  that  termination  is  in  the  participant’s  best  medical  interest  or 
administrative decision for a reason other than an AE/SAE. 
• A female participant becomes pregnant.  
• Lost to follow-up.  
• Decision by the sponsor to halt the entire study. 
• Any treatment for nAMD other than study interventions in the study eye is considered a prohibited treatment, 
and participant must be withdrawn from the study. 
• Systemic anti-angiogenic agents were taken by the participant during the study. 
• If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the participant's well-being. 
• At the specific request  of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (e.g., obvious noncompliance or 
safety concerns). 
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted. The 
participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. 
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue 
to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.

The  primary  objective  and  endpoint  were  discussed  during 
the  EMA  Scientific  Advice  (SA) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/277944/2019) and concerns were raised regarding the choice of an endpoint at 48 week in 
view of the increased intervals. Indeed, as stated in the SA there is a need to conclude on the durability of 
efficacy when extending the dosing intervals. A need for at least 64 week data, preferably supplemented with 
some 2-year data is foreseen to support the Q12 and/or Q16 dosing regimens as well as long-term safety. The 
MAH provided clinical results with a data cut-off at 60 weeks. 
Sample size 
The sample size of 960 subjects (3x320) was adequately estimated and included 10% possible dropout. It was 
based on a non-inferiority of two 8 mg dose-regimens aiming to consent a loss of efficacy over the 2 mg control 
regimen at 48 weeks not exceeding 4 characters of the EDTRS chart (i.e. one line of the chart), with 0.025 risk 
to a false positive non-inferiority and 94% chance to achieve the true positive non-inferiority. 
Randomization 
The randomization was performed with an interactive system for which it is not clear if it was through a web 
or a voice system or both. The 3 active arms were evenly distributed in the trial (1:1:1) and stratified over the 
geographical region (Japan vs Rest of the World) and the BCVA baseline (<60 vs ≥60). The granularity of the 
geographical  stratification  seems  a  bit  wide  given  the  heterogeneity  of  regions  involved  in  the  trial  (Asia, 
Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America and South America). 
Blinding (masking) 
As stated by the MAH, all study site personnel (except for those performing the unmasked roles as described 
in Table 7-2), were to remain masked to treatment assignment of participants in order to ensure an unbiased 
assessment  of  visual  acuity,  safety,  and  ancillary  study  measures.  Masking  continued  until  the  end  of  the 
masked transition period of the study extension. 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
related to the masked treatment, the participant’s treatment code is usually to be unmasked before reporting 
to the health authorities, ethics committees and investigators. 
The  blinding  of  dose  regimens  was  adequately  guaranteed  through  sham  injections  in  order  to  mask  the 
difference in injection schedules. In addition, the unmasked investigator administering the study drug did not 
participate in any efficacy or safety endpoint evaluations apart from the reporting of AEs and device-related 
AEs/SAEs/deficiencies relating to filter needle, injection needle, or syringe during injection procedure and post-
injection assessment. Therefore, no impact on study integrity is expected.  
An overview of the masked and unmasked site personnel is presented in Table 4.

Statistical methods 
• Populations for statistical analyses 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication; 
it  was  based  on  the  treatment  assigned  to  the  patient  at  baseline  (as  randomized).  FAS  was  the  primary 
analysis set for efficacy endpoints. 
The per-protocol set (PPS) was to include all patients in the FAS who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline 
assessment of BCVA, had any IRF or SRF affecting the central subfield at baseline and did not have any relevant 
important protocol violations that affect the primary efficacy variable. The final determination on the exclusion 
of patients from the PPS was to be made on the masked data prior to the first database lock and described in 
a  separate  document.  Analysis  of  the  PPS  was  to  be  performed  according  to  the  treatment  the  participant 
actually received (as treated). The PPS was used for supplementary analysis of change from baseline in BCVA 
(non-inferiority only) at week 48 (primary endpoint) and week 60 (key secondary endpoint). 
Treatment assignment was based on the treatment received (as treated). In general, the randomized treatment 
group was to be considered as the actual treatment group, unless the patient has not been treated at all after 
randomization. Isolated incorrect treatments did not constitute a change in the “as treated” assignment but 
was considered as intercurrent events (refer to Section 5.6.1). 
The safety analysis set (SAF) included all randomized patients who received any study treatment; it was based 
on the treatment received (as treated). Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables 
were analyzed using the SAF. The safety analysis was performed on the observed safety data. 
The  efficacy  populations  of  analysis  were  acceptable,  except  for  PPS  which  was  planned  to  be  analysed  “as 
treated”  while  an  error  of  treatment  allocation  should  be  considered  as  a  major  deviation  to  the  protocol. 
Moreover, if the wrong treatment allocation occurred only at some specific time-points of the 48/60 weeks of 
exposure (this case is defined as an ICE), the rational for deciding which arm to assign to patient in the “as 
treated” strategy was initially unclear. As requested, clarifications have been brought by the Applicant regarding 
the  “as  treated”  terminology  used  in  the  trial.  Only  6  patients  were  concerned  with  the  qualification  of  "as 
treated", whom only one subject underwent an error of treatment allocation. The other subjects were affected 
by deviations in the amount of volume injected or in the modalities of administration. 
Overall, the issue could be considered as solved though the PP set do not reflect per-se the definition of such 
a population where patients presenting deviations in planned regimens potentially affecting the primary efficacy 
endpoint should be excluded. 
Results  
Participant flow  
The disposition of participants in the overall study through Week 48 and Week 60 is presented in Table 8-1. 
The MAH indicate that the number of participants who did not complete study shown in this table could differ 
from  the  number  who  did  not  complete  study  treatment  in  Figure  8-1,  because  participants  who  did  not 
complete study treatment through Week 48 or Week 60 could have remained in the study (for other reasons 
of differences).

Recruitment 
Date first subject randomized: 20 Aug 2020 
Date last subject completed Week 60 / End of Study Visit: 04 Nov 2022 
The study was conducted at a total of in 19 EU countries, as well as in 6 APAC countries and 3 countries in 
American continent (Table 8-5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

Recruitment of subjects by country was overall balanced between treatment arms, except for Canada, Estonia, 
Serbia and Singapore where not all arms included patients due to the very low enrolment rate.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
The  frequency  of  participants  with  important  protocol  deviations  through  Week  60  was  similar  across  the 
treatment groups (Table 8-2). 
Overall, 355 (35.1%) participants reported important protocol deviations. The most frequent (≥ 5%) important 
protocol deviations were related to the categories: Procedure deviations, Treatment deviations, Time schedule 
deviations, and Informed consent. 
Other protocol deviations were related to the COVID-19 pandemic (in 75 patients among them 1 not included 
in the Week 60 database) and Ukraine/Russian crisis (in 10 patients).  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 38/235 
 
 
 
Considering that 35.1% of patients across the groups in PULSAR study reported important protocol 
deviations, the MAH was asked to discuss the impact of each of them on the efficacy analysis.  
As requested, the Applicant has clarified what was meant by "important" protocol deviations in PULSAR study 
and described extensively the corresponding deviations as well as the decision rules that led to rule out from 
the primary analysis or the PPS analysis, all or part of data of patients presenting these deviations, depending 
on the way the might affect efficacy outcome and when they occurred. “Important” deviations to protocol were 
segmented  in  3  categories:  1/  the  ones  not  impacting  the  efficacy  endpoints  led  to  no  exclusion  from  main 
efficacy  analyses;  2/  deviations  that  might  affect  the  efficacy  endpoints  and  identified  at  screening  led  to 
excluding affected patients from the per-protocol set; 3/ deviations that might impact the efficacy and occurring 
after baselines measurements led to excluding from the main efficacy analyses partial data of affected patients. 
These  last  deviations  were  considered  as  intercurrent  events  and  handled  according  to  estimand  strategies 
(mainly,  hypothetical  and  treatment  policy  strategies,  depending  on  the  strength  of  the  impact  on  efficacy 
data).  Tables illustrating and justifying the updated definition and all concerned cases were provided and even 
though other approaches could have been considered, the proposed approach is reasonable. 
However, in non-inferiority trials, it is well known that heterogeneity of data is a factor artificially favoring the 
non-inferiority, therefore, it would have been relevant to perform a per-protocol analysis excluding all patients 
presenting with "important" deviations impacting the primary endpoint within the 48 weeks treatment window, 
whatever the reason and the time of occurrence￼This analysis, repeated on EU population would have been 
interesting too.

Baseline data 
Proportion of male and female were well balanced between the 3 arms, even if slightly more female patients 
were  included  in  total  (54,5%).  Data  were  mostly  well  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups  for  the 
demographics and disease characteristics at baseline, except for discrepancies observed between groups for 
certain categories of age (<65, ≥ 65 to < 75 and ≥ 75 to < 80 years) and in patients with history of ischaemic 
heart disease and hepatic impairment (mild, severe, moderate). 
Baseline disease characteristics of the study eye  
The  mean  BCVA  using  ETDRS  letter  score  averaged  over  all  treatment  groups  at  baseline  was  59.6  letters; 
86.2% of participants had an ETDRS letter score ≤ 73 and 41.7% of ≤ 60 letters. Individual values ranged 
from 24 and 78 letters overall and in each of the treatment groups at baseline, with mean values of 58.9, 59.9, 
and 60.0 in the 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16 groups, respectively. 
The mean IOP in the study eye averaged over all treatment groups at baseline was 14.9 mmHg. Individual IOP 
values ranged from 6 to 25 mmHg overall and in the 2q8 group (from 7 to 25 mmHg in the HDq12 and HDq16 
groups), with mean values of 14.8, 14.9, and 14.9 mmHg in the 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16 treatment groups, 
respectively.  
The mean (SD) values of CST at baseline were 367.1 (133.6) μm in the 2q8 group, 370.3 (123.7) μm in the 
HDq12 group, and 370.7 (132.7) μm in the HDq16 group. 
Medical and surgical history 
The ocular medical and surgical history in the study eye mostly  reported (>  10%) were AMD, Cataract and 
Cataract operation. Overall, baseline data for patient’s medical and surgical history were comparable across 
the 3 groups, except for the cataract history were 101 (53.9) in the 2q8 group, 169 (50.4) in the HDq12 group,

and 206 (60.9) patients in the HDq16 group were observed, as well for patients with history of eyelid ptosis, 
retinal tear, vitreous disorder and asthenopia, in which no patient were included in all groups. 
Regarding the non-ocular medical and surgical history in the study eye, the most commonly reported SOC (> 
30%)  were  Vascular  disorders,  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  Surgical  and  medical  procedures,  and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.

Outcomes and estimation 
Overview of hierarchical testing procedure, corresponding test decisions and statistical conclusions 
Table 9-6 provides a summary of the results compiled by the MAH for the primary and key secondary endpoints 
included in the hierarchical testing procedure, as per the EP-SAP. The first 5 confirmatory tests in the hierarchy 
(H10, H20, H30, H40, H50) were statistically significant at the alpha level of 0.025 (one-sided tests). Therefore, 
the following is concluded:  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 46/235 
 
 
 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the 
primary endpoint “change from baseline in BCVA at Week 48” and with regard to the key secondary endpoint 
“change from baseline in BCVA at Week 60” (p=0.0009 and p=0.0002, respectively) 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HDq16  is  non-inferior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the 
primary endpoint “change from baseline in BCVA at Week 48” and with regard to the key secondary endpoint 
“change from baseline in BCVA at Week 60” (p=0.0011 and p < 0.0001, respectively) 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HD  is  superior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the  key 
secondary endpoint “proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 16” (p = 
0.0002) 
The confirmatory test for superiority of HDq12 vs. 2q8 (H60) in the primary endpoint “change from baseline in 
BCVA at Week 48” was not statistically significant (p = 0.8437) and hence the hierarchical testing procedure 
was stopped at the H60 test (i.e. the confirmatory test for superiority of Week 60 HDq12 vs. 2q8, H70, must 
not be performed). 
For the sake of completeness, when applying the hierarchical testing procedure defined in the G-SAP, the first 
3 confirmatory tests in the hierarchy (H10, H30, H50) were statistically significant at the alpha level of 0.025 
(one-sided tests) (W48 Table 14.2.1/1 and W48 Table 14.2.2/1 of the PH-42588 report section). Therefore, 
the following is concluded: 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 47/235 
 
 
 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the 
primary endpoint “change from baseline in BCVA at Week 48” 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HDq16  is  non-inferior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the 
primary endpoint “change from baseline in BCVA at Week 48” 
·  Treatment  of  participants  with  nAMD  with  HD  is  superior  to  treatment  with  2q8  with  regard  to  the  key 
secondary endpoint “proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 16”. 
The non-inferiority of each high dose over the control dose is formally demonstrated at 48 and 60 weeks of 
treatment in the ITT population, as well as the superiority of the pooled high doses at 16 weeks of treatment 
in  the  subgroup  of  patients  without  IRF  and  SRF  in  subfield  central.  No  superiority  can be  claimed  over  the 
control dose for individual high doses. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
For  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  MAH  used  a  mixed  model  for  repeated 
measurements  (MMRM)  with  baseline  BCVA  measurement  as  a  covariate  and  treatment  group,  visit,  the 
stratification variables (geographic region [Japan vs. Rest of World], and baseline BCVA [< 60 vs. ≥ 60]) as 
fixed  factors  as  well  as  terms  for  the  interaction  between  baseline  BCVA  and  visit  and  for  the  interaction 
between treatment and visit. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 9-2. 
Change from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score at Week 48 
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in BCVA resulted in LS mean changes from baseline to Week 
48  (i.e.  estimated,  adjusted  mean  changes)  of  7.03,  6.06  and  5.89  letters  for  the  2q8,  HDq12  and  HDq16 
groups, respectively (Table 9-2).  
The estimated difference in LS means changes from baseline to Week 48 in BCVA (with corresponding 95% CI) 
of HDq12 vs. 2q8 was -0.97 (-2.87, 0.92) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 was -1.14 (-2.97, 0.69) letters (Table 
9-2). The p-values for the non-inferiority test at a margin of 4 letters were 0.0009 (related to H10) for HDq12 
vs. 2q8, and 0.0011 (related to H30) for HDq16 vs. 2q8; p-values for a superiority test were 0.8437 (related 
to H60) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and of 0.8884 (related to H80) for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (W48 Table 14.2.1/1).  
The  arithmetic  mean  (SD)  changes  from  baseline  in  BCVA  to  Week  48  (i.e.  observed,  unadjusted  mean 
changes) were 7.6 (12.2), 6.7 (12.6), and 6.2 (11.7) letters for the 285, 299, and 289 participants with Week 
48  data,  i.e.  excluding  data  after  an  ICE  as  handled  by  the  hypothetical  strategy,  in  the  2q8,  HDq12,  and 
HDq16 groups, respectively (Table 9-2).  
The arithmetic mean changes from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score by visit, based on

The analysis of this key secondary efficacy variable at Week 60 resulted in LS mean changes from baseline to 
Week 60 (i.e. estimated, adjusted mean changes) of 7.23, 6.37 and 6.31 letters for the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 
groups, respectively (Table 9-2).  
The estimated difference in LS means changes from baseline to Week 60 in BCVA (with corresponding 95% CI) 
of HDq12 vs. 2q8 was -0.86 (-2.57, 0.84) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 was -0.92 (-2.51, 0.66) letters (Table 
9-2). The p-values for the non-inferiority test at a margin of 4 letters were 0.0002 (related to H20) for HDq12 
vs. 2q8, and < 0.0001 (related to H40) for HDq16 vs. 2q8; p-values for a superiority test were 0.8393 (related 
to H70) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and of 0.8731 (related to H90) for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (W60 Table 14.2.2/31).  
The  arithmetic  mean  (SD)  changes  from  baseline  in  BCVA  to  Week  60  (i.e.  observed,  unadjusted  mean 
changes) were 7.8 (12.6), 6.6 (13.6), and 6.6 (11.7) letters for the 268, 283, and 282 participants with Week 
60  data,  i.e.  excluding  data  after  an  ICE  as  handled  by  the  hypothetical  strategy,  in  the  2q8,  HDq12,  and 
HDq16 groups, respectively (Table 9-2).  
The arithmetic mean changes from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score by visit through Week 
60, based on OC prior to ICE in the FAS, are graphically displayed in Figure 9-1; the corresponding LS mean 
changes (95% CIs) from baseline in BCVA by visit, based on MMRM in the FAS, are displayed in Figure 9-2. 
The mean as well as the LS mean increases in BCVA over time were similar across all groups through Week 60 
with minor numerical differences not being considered of clinical relevance.

The analysis of the key secondary endpoint was repeated on the PPS as supplementary analysis and the results 
were consistent with those in the FAS.  
Overall, the primary and key secondary endpoint criteria, to know, the change from baseline in BCVA measured 
by  the  ETDRS  letter  score  at  Week  48  and  60  (non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  HDq12  and  HDq16 
dosing  regimen  to  the  current  authorized  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  2q8  dosing  regimen)  is  considered  to  be 
statistically met (95% credible interval for treatment difference with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with 
LS mean change from baseline in BCVA to Week 48), at Week 48 and 60.  
However,  even  if  the  non-inferiority  appear  to  be  statistically  met,  given  the  longer  intervals  in  the  new 
proposed  dosing  regimen  (HDq12  and  HDq16),  more  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  results  are  awaited. 
Therefore, and as discussed in the previous scientific advice dated from 2019, in order to straighten the efficacy 
and safety results, the Applicant was requested to provide the 2 years data.  
In response, the Applicant provides additional new long-term data from PULSAR study where around 80% of 
patients  completed  Week  96  and  PHOTON  study  where  100%  completed  Week  96.  Indeed,  to  respond  to 
request for some 2-year data, a snapshot of PULSAR data up to Week 96 was performed in May 2023. This 
dataset comprises all patients (100%) enrolled in PULSAR. Of ongoing patients, approximately 80% (689 out 
of  875)  had  already  completed  the  Week  96  visit  and  almost  all  had  completed  visits  up  to  Week  88.  More 
precisely, of the 1009 randomized patients included in the FAS and the SAF, 689 patients had completed the 
study through Week 96. 137 patients had discontinued prematurely. For 186 patients (18.4%), according to 
the Applicant, these patients constitute the ongoing patients at the time of the data snapshot.

The mean number of active injections in the Week 96 completers of the PULSAR SAF population was 12.8, 9.8 
and 8.2 in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups, respectively, over the first 96 weeks of the study. 
Of note, the proportions of Week 96 completers in the European subgroups were even higher than in the non-
European subgroups given that the recruitment in Europe was completed earlier than in other regions. 
For the PHOTON study, this later reached Week 96 LPLV in May 2023.  Therefore, complete Week 96 key results 
for the DME indication are available in full for all study participants. Of the 660 randomized patients included 
in the FAS and the SAF, 534 patients completed the study through Week 96. However, 126 patients did not 
complete the study, with a higher proportion of patients in the HDq12 group (22.2% vs. 15.2% and 16.8%), 
mainly attributable to withdrawal of consent by subject, lost to follow-up and death. Of note, 31 (4.7%) patients 
were  reported  as  lost  to  follow-up  through  Week  96.  As  for  the  PULSAR  study,  the  mean  number  of  active 
injections in the PHOTON SAF population of Week-96 completers was proportional to allocated interval dosing 
with a number of injections of 13.8, 9.5 and 7.8 in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups, respectively 
over the first 96 weeks of the study. 
Overall and based on the provided long-term data, it appears that the product dosed every 12 weeks (HDq12) 
or  every  16  weeks  (HDq16)  showed  maintained  non-inferior  efficacy  through  Week  96  compared  to  2  mg 
aflibercept, consistent with the results demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to improvement in 
BCVA and CST in patients with nAMD or DME. It is important to note that these W96 analysis are exploratory 
and should be interpreted with caution. 
Additionally, the MAH was asked to further discuss clinical relevance of the chosen 4 letters margin rather than 
a smaller one as advised in the previous scientific advice.  
The  justification  of  the  non-inferiority  margin  provided  by  the  Applicant  is  consistent  and  clinically  relevant. 
This  margin  ensures  that  any  difference  in  visual  acuity  within  one  line  of  the  ETDRS  chart  is  not  clinically 
meaningful. This 4-letters margin has been used in many non-inferiority trials investigating visual acuity.  
Moreover, the MAH should further discuss and justify the initiation dosing regimen that appears to be 4 times 
higher  exposure  than  the  current  regimen  authorized  and  provide  efficacy  and  safety  results  regarding  that 
period for both PULSAR and PHOTON studies.  
During the loading phase (up to Week 12), in PULSAR (3 monthly injections in all study arms) and PHOTON 
studies (5 monthly injections for 2q8 and 3 monthly injections for all HD) all treatment arms received active 
monthly injection with either 2 mg or 8 mg aflibercept at day 1, week 4 and week 8.  
In PULSAR, comparable proportions of ocular TEAE were reported (17,3% for 2q8 vs 18,1% for all HD) and 
proportions of TEAE reported in more than 2 patients and with a difference ≥ 0.5% to the 2 mg arm (retinal 
haemorrhage,  conjunctivitis,  IOP  increase  and  vitreous  floaters)  were  low  and  comparable.  Additionally, 
comparable  proportions  were  reported  for  ocular  safety  topics  (cataract,  retinal  detachment/tear,  RPE  tear, 
and  intraocular  inflammation)  other  than  IOP  increase  for  which  event  were  all  non-serious  and  without 
sustained IOP elevations. Non-ocular TEAE were reported in higher proportions for HD group (22.1% vs 16.7% 
in  2q8  arm).  For  SOC  in  which  a  difference  of  >  1%  was  observed  and  higher  incidence  in  the  HD  arms 
(Infections and infestations and Vascular disorders), PT reported in more than 1 patient were Pulpitis dental, 
Upper respiratory and Urinary tract infection and Hypertension. Incidence for non-ocular safety topics were low 
and comparable between treatment arms.  
In  PHOTON,  incidences  of  ocular  TEAEs  were  higher  in  the  HD  group  (2q8:  9.6%,  all  HD:  17.1%)  however 
when compared to PULSAR studies a lower proportion of ocular TEAE was reported in 2q8 arm (PULSAR - 2q8: 
17.3%, PHOTON – 2q8: 9.6%) and incidences for ocular TEAE in the HD group were nevertheless similar to 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

PULSAR. Events reported in more than 2 patients and with a difference ≥ 0.5% to the 2 mg arm consisted of 
cataract/cataract cortical, conjunctival hemorrhage, photopsia, punctate keratitis, and vitreous detachment for 
which  no  consistent  trend  were  observed  across  studies.  Proportions  of  ocular  safety  topics  were  low  and 
comparable  between  treatment  arms.  Non-ocular  event  were  reported  in  comparable  proportions  between 
treatment arms. For the SOC with a difference of > 1% and higher incidence in the HD arms (Gastrointestinal 
disorders,  Infections  and  infestations,  Nervous  system  disorders,  Psychiatric  disorders,  Renal  and  urinary 
disorders and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders), majority of PTs were reported in single patient 
with no consistent trend were observed across studies. Incidences for non-ocular safety topics were low and 
comparable.  
Overall, although exposures to aflibercept in the HD treatment arms in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies were 
higher during the loading phase and that the incidence of ocular TEAE in the 2q8 arms in both groups were 
disparate,  safety  data  are  still  reassuring  and  in  favour  of  a  comparable  safety  profile  with  ocular  and  non-
ocular TEAE being reported in similar range between both studies. No consistent trend could be observed in 
both studies. 
Subgroup analysis of change from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score at Week 
48 and Week 60 
Week 48 
Subgroup analyses for changes from baseline in BCVA at Week 48 by age, sex, geographic region, ethnicity, 
race, baseline BCVA letters, and baseline PCV were performed by the MAH using MMRM in the FAS.  
A tendency to higher mean increases in the HD groups compared to the 2q8 group may be considered for the 
Asian subgroup (N = 234), which showed estimated differences in LSmeans (95% CIs) of 2.30 (-1.82, 6.41) 
letters for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and of 1.57 (-1.96, 5.10) letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (W48 Table 14.2.1/10).  
A similar tendency was observed for the Japanese subgroup (N = 97), with differences of 1.83 (-5.62, 9.29) 
letters for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and 3.19 (-2.63, 9.00) letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (Table 14.2.1/8).

Week 60 
The tendency to higher mean increases in the HD groups compared to the 2q8 group noted for the Asian (N = 
234) and the Japanese (N = 97) subgroups at Week 48 (see above) was less pronounced at Week 60: in the 
Asian subgroup, the estimated differences in LS means (95% CIs) were 1.64 (-1.83, 5.11) letters for HDq12 
vs. 2q8 and 0.54 (-2.32, 3.40) letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (W60 Table 14.2.2/40); 
In the Japanese subgroup, the corresponding differences were 0.28 (-6.20, 6.76) letters for HDq12 vs. 2q8 
and 1.59 (-3.09, 6.27) letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (W60 Table 14.2.2/38).

The results presented for the changes from baseline in BCVA at Week 48 and 60 were similar with the overall 
population. Tendency for higher mean increases in the HD groups compared to the 2q8 group were noted for 
the Asian and Japanese subgroups at Week 48 and 60 in PULSAR study. However, given the smaller size of 
these subgroups, the validity of these comparisons is limited. 
Sensitivity analysis for change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 48 and Week 60 
Week 48 
Different sensitivity analyses were performed by the MAH for the primary endpoint, change from baseline in 
BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score at Week 48, one using an ANCOVA with LOCF (Table 14.2.1/3) and 
one using an ANCOVA after applying MI in the FAS (Table 14.2.1/4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 55/235 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis using MMRM in the 
FAS: 
The estimated differences (95% CIs) in LS means were -1.08 (-2.92, 0.76) for the comparison HDq12 vs. 2q8 
and were -1.23 (-3.07, 0.61) letters for the comparison HDq16 vs. 2q8 when using ANCOVA with LOCF (Table 
14.2.1/3).  
The estimated differences (95% CIs) in LS means were -0.93 (-2.79, 0.94) for the comparison HDq12 vs. 2q8 
and were -1.13 (-3.02, 0.77) letters for the comparison HDq16 vs. 2q8 when using ANCOVA after applying MI 
(Table 14.2.1/4).  
In order to check robustness of the results if the missing data are not MAR, also a tipping point analysis was 
conducted by the MAH based on the MI analysis and the results are provided in Table 14.2.1/5. The results of 
this analysis show that the smallest shift parameter (delta) used as penalty for participants with missing data 
in the HD groups, for which non-inferiority could not be shown anymore (with a 1-sided t-test at a significance 
level of 0.025), i.e. the “tipping point” that significantly reversed the analysis result, was delta = -11 letters 
for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and delta = -7 letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 (Table 14.2.1/5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 56/235 
 
 
 
 
The “tipping point” values of -11 letters and -7 letters requiring such a large difference in BCVA at Week 48 
between HDq16 and HDq12 vs. 2q8, respectively, do not seem plausible. 
Therefore, the primary analysis of non-inferiority conclusion based on MMRM method is robust to the departure 
of the MAR assumption according to the MAH.  
Week 60 
Different sensitivity analyses were performed for the key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in BCVA 
measured by the ETDRS letter score at Week 60, one using an ANCOVA with LOCF (Table 14.2.2/33) and one 
using an ANCOVA after applying MI in the FAS (Table 14.2.2/34). 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 57/235 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis using MMRM in the 
FAS and similar to the corresponding analyses for Week 48 (see above):  
The estimated differences (95% CIs) in LS means were -1.07 (-2.96, 0.82) for the comparison HDq12 vs. 2q8 
and were -1.14 (-3.03, 0.74) letters for the comparison HDq16 vs. 2q8 when using ANCOVA with LOCF (Table 
14.2.2/33). 
The estimated differences (95% CIs) in LS means were -1.11 (-3.06, 0.84) for the comparison HDq12 vs. 2q8 
and were -1.16 (-3.11, 0.79) letters for the comparison HDq16 vs. 2q8 when using ANCOVA after applying MI 
(Table 14.2.1/34).  
In order to check robustness of the results if the missing data are not MAR, a tipping point analysis was also 
conducted  based  on  the  MI  analysis  for  Week  60  and  the  results  were  similar  to  those  at  Week  48  (Table 
14.2.2/35).

As indicted in the table and figure above, The LS mean of BCVA gains appears to be stable over time and similar 
across all groups, with minor numerical differences not being considered as clinically relevant.  
Secondary key endpoint analysis 
Proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 16  
This  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  describes  the  proportion  of  all  participants  with  no  IRF  and  no  SRF  in 
central subfield at Week 16 as assessed by the reading center. The results  of the analysis for this endpoint 
based on data using LOCF are presented by the MAH in Table 9-3. 
As both HD groups and the 2 mg group were all treated identically with 3 initial monthly doses prior to Week 
16, the pooled HDq12 and HDq16 were compared to the 2q8 group for this endpoint. At Week 16, 63.3% of 
participants in the pooled HD groups had no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) compared to 51.6% in the 2q8 
treatment group. The difference (95% CI) between pooled HD groups vs. 2q8 treatment was 11.733% points 
(5.263%, 18.204%) superiority. The p-value of the 1-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for superiority 
was 0.0002 (Table 9-3). 
Assessment report

Of note, the observation that 3.6% of the participants in the 2q8 and the pooled HD groups, respectively, in 
the FAS had no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at screening with similar proportions at baseline (see W48 
Table 14.2.2/15), although Inclusion criterion 6 required the presence of IRF and/or SRF, can be explained by 
the fact that the eligibility criteria were assessed by the investigators at screening based on preliminary data, 
whereas the above observations of no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) in some participants were based on 
updated reading center data. The reading center provided eligibility assessment for all participants based on 
imaging exams performed at screening, while the investigator confirmed eligibility based on imaging exams 
performed  at  randomization.  The  imaging  exams  performed  at  screening,  baseline  and  every  other  visit 
subsequently underwent detailed grading by the reading center, independently from the eligibility check. Based 
on this detailed grading, a very small number of discrepancies were noted in the assessment of fluid in screening 
OCTs.

This  observation  did  not  appear  to  have  a  major  impact  on  the  results:  The  analysis  of  this  key  secondary 
endpoint was repeated on the PPS as supplementary analysis by the MAH, in which participants with no IRF 
and no SRF in central subfield at baseline were excluded, and the results were consistent with those obtained 
in the FAS (W48 Table 14.2.2/2).

At Week 16, 62.5% of participants in the pooled HD groups had no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) compared 
to 50.3% in the 2q8 treatment group. The difference (95% CI) between the pooled HD groups and the 2q8 
group, using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by geographical region and baseline BCVA (< 60 vs. 
≥ 60), was 12.327% points (5.726%, 18.929%). 
Subgroup analysis for proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 
16 
The proportions of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 16 by subgroups age, sex, 
geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline BCVA, and baseline polypoidal choroidal vascularization (PCV) are 
presented by the MAH in the following Table:

Discrepancies in results of absence of IRF/SRF in central subfield at Week 16 in the HD groups compared to 
the 2q8 group appeared in the following subgroups of patients: < 65 years, ≥ 65 to < 75 years, ≥ 80 to < 85 
years, females, from Rest of the world, not Hispanic or Latino, White, with a baseline BCVA ≤ 73 letters, and 
no  PCV  at  baseline.  However,  given  the  smaller  size  of  these  subgroups,  the  validity  of  these  comparisons 
appears limited. 
Sensitivity analysis for proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at Week 
16 
For a sensitivity analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable, proportion of participants with no IRF and no 
SRF  in  central  subfield  at  Week  16  in  the  FAS,  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test  was  calculated  by  the  MAH 
based on OC only (W48 Table 14.2.2/3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 66/235 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of this sensitivity analysis were similar to the results using LOCF in the FAS: 
At Week 16, 62.8% of participants in the pooled HD groups had no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) compared 
to 50.9% in the 2q8 treatment group. The difference (95% CI) between the pooled HD groups and the 2q8 
group, using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by geographical region and baseline BCVA (< 60 vs. 
≥ 60), was 11.985% points (5.423%, 18.547%). 
Proportion  of  participants  with  no  IRF  and  no  SRF  in  the  center  subfield  at  Week  48  (additional 
secondary efficacy variable) and through Week 60 
The proportion of participants with no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) in the center subfield at Week 48 was 
numerically higher in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups (71.1% and 66.8%, respectively) compared to the 2q8 
treatment group 59.4%, based on LOCF in the FAS. The pairwise differences (95% CI) for the 2-sided tests, 
using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by geographical region and baseline BCVA (< 60 vs. ≥ 60), 
of 11.725% points (4.527%, 18.923%) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and 7.451% points (0.142%, 14.760%) for HDq16 
vs. 2q8 were both in favor of HD treatment (Table 9-4).  
Even  larger  differences  in  favor  of  HD  treatment  were  obtained  using  OC  prior  to  ICE  for  the  pairwise 
comparisons in the FAS, providing differences of 15.417% points (7.664%, 23.170%) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and 
11.397% points (3.452%, 19.343%) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 (W48 Table 14.2.3/18 of the PH-42588 report section). 
Summary statistics for the proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at baseline, 
Week 16, Week 48, and Week 60, using LOCF for the FAS, are presented in Table 9-5. As can be seen from 
this table, the proportions of participants with no retinal fluid were > 50% at both Week 16 and Week 48 and 
numerically higher at Week 48 than at Week 16 in all 3 treatment groups and the pooled HD groups. At Week 
60, the proportions of participants with no retinal fluid were > 70% and similar in all 3 treatment groups and 
the pooled HD groups.

The second key secondary endpoint concerned the proportion of participants with no intraretinal fluid (IRF) and 
no subretinal fluid (SRF) in Central Subfield at Week 16. All arms received the 3 initial monthly doses prior to 
week 16. At week 16, 51.6% in the 2q8 treatment group compared to 63.3% of participants in the pooled HD 
groups (61.6% in HDq12 and 65% in HDq16) had no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) with a difference (95% 
CI) between pooled HD groups vs. 2q8 treatment of 11.733% points (5.263%, 18.204%) superiority and a p-
value of the 1-sided CMH test for superiority of 0.0002. The key secondary endpoint appears to be statistically 
met for both HD groups at week 16 and data at 48 and 60 weeks to numerically confirm results in favour of 
the HD groups. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Proportion of participants gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA 
From baseline to Week 48  
The proportions of participants gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 48, using LOCF in the

Change in CNV size from baseline 
Week 48 
The mean CNV size at baseline was similar ranging from 6.0 to 6.5 mm² across the 3 treatment groups. Mean 
changes from baseline at Week 48 showed mean decreases in the HD groups and the 2q8 group. The estimated 
contrasts (95% CI) for the 2-sided test, using the MMRM in the FAS, of -1.22 (-1.94, -0.51) mm² for HDq12 
vs. 2q8 and of -0.48 (-1.22, 0.27) mm² for HDq16 vs. 2q8 were both numerically in favor of HD treatment

Change in total lesion area from baseline 
Week 48 
The  mean  total  lesion  area  at  baseline  was  similar  across  the  3  treatment  groups,  ranging  from  6.4  to  6.9 
mm². Mean changes from baseline at Week 48 showed mean decreases in the HD groups but a mean increase 
in the 2q8 group. The estimated contrasts (95% CI) for the 2-sided test, using the MMRM in the FAS, of -0.55 
(-1.04, -0.06) mm² for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and of -0.44 (-0.94, 0.06) mm² for HDq16 vs. 2q8 were numerically in 
favor of HD treatment (Table 9-11). 
The corresponding analysis using an ANCOVA with LOCF in the FAS provided mean changes from baseline to 
Week 48 and estimated contrasts (95% CIs) for the 2-sided tests between the HD groups and the 2q8 group 
that were numerically also in favor of HD treatment and thus consistent with the results from the analysis using 
MMRM (Table 14.2.3/14 of the PH-42588 report section). The corresponding summary statistics for total lesion 
area by visit using LOCF are presented in Table 14.2.3/16 of the PH-42588 report section.

Change from baseline in CST 
Week 48 
The mean values of CST at baseline were ranging from 367.1 to 370.7 μm across the 3 treatment groups. Mean 
decreases from baseline were observed in all treatment groups at Week 48, which were higher in the HD groups 
than in the 2q8 group. The estimated contrasts (95% CIs) for the 2-sided tests, using the MMRM in the FAS, 
of -11.12 (-21.06,-1.18) μm for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and of -10.51 (-20.12,-0.90) μm for HDq16 vs. 2q8 were both

As noted in table above, mean decreases from baseline in CST were observed in all treatment groups at Week 
96,  with  arger  mean  decreases  in  the  HD  groups  than  in  the  2q8,  except  for  HDq16.  Overall,  the  mean 
decreases from baseline in CST over time seems to be maintained and similar across all groups with generally 
minor  numerical  differences  that  could  be  considered  as  not  clinically  meaningful.  Although  exploratory,  it 
should be noted that contrary to BCVA analysis, the results on CST are not statistically significant. 
Change from baseline in NEI-VFQ-25 total score 
Week 48 
The mean values of the NEI-VFQ-25 total score at baseline across the 3 treatment groups were similar and 
ranging from 76.4 to 77.8. Mean increases from baseline were observed in all groups at Week 48, which were 
numerically lower in the HD groups than in the 2q8 group (Table 9-14).

Week 60 
The mean NEI-VFQ-25 total score at baseline across the 3 treatment groups were ranging from 76.36 to 77.81. 
The mean changes from baseline in NEI-VFQ-25 total score over time, based on OC prior to ICE, were all mean 
increases, which were numerically lower in the HD groups than in the 2q8 group at Week 24, Week 48, and 
Week 60. The mean (SD) increases from baseline at Week 60, which ranged from 3.65 (12.08) in the HDq12 
group to 5.10 (11.38) in the 2q8 group, were similar to those at Week 48 (Table 14.2.3/25).  
Overall, secondary efficacy endpoints results for HD groups (HDq12 and HDq16) in PULSAR study appears to 
be following the same tendency as for the 2q8 group with a slight numerical superiority in favour to the HDq12 
regimen  compared  to  the  HDq16.  Therefore  the  MAH  should  further  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  the 
secondary endpoint results with regards to the two new proposed dosing regimen.

As  requested,  the  applicant  provides  a  comprehensive  discussion  regarding  the  clinical  relevance  of  the 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  results  for  HD  groups  (HDq12  and  HDq16)  in  PULSAR  study  (functional  and 
anatomical  response  based  on  Change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  measured  by  the  ETDRS  letter,  Proportion  of 
participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield, Proportion of participants gaining ≥ 15 letters in BCVA, 
Change from baseline in CST...).  
Overall,  the  functional  measures  show  similar  outcomes  across  the  3  treatment  groups,  with  non-inferiority 
demonstrated  in  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  60,  in  line  with  the 
primary endpoint results at Week 48. Between the two HD groups, numerical differences in other secondary 
endpoints are small, and not always in favour of HDq12 (e.g. proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters 
in BCVA from baseline to Week 48). In conclusion, the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints in PULSAR 
are  globally  in  line  with  the  primary  analysis  and  seem  clinically  relevant  for  demonstrating  the  value  of 
aflibercept for the treatment of nAMD. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Change from baseline in BCVA averaged over the period from Week 36 to Week 48 and from Week 
48 to Week 60 
Mean (SD) values in BCVA were similar among treatment groups in the FAS at baseline across all treatment 
groups. The observed mean (SD) changes from baseline in BCVA averaged over the period from Week 36 to 
Week 48 and from Week 48 to Week 60 were similar to those for the primary endpoint (Table 9-15).  
Proportions of participants gaining and losing at least 5 or at least 10 letters in BCVA from baseline 
at Week 48 and Week 60 
Overall, the proportions of participants gaining or losing at least 5 or 10 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 
48 are presented in Table 9-16.

The proportion of participants gaining at least 10 letters or at least 5 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 48 
were numerically higher in the 2q8 group than in the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups, based on LOCF in 
the FAS. In contrast, the proportion of participants who showed any gain (> 0 letters) in BCVA from baseline 
was similar in the HDq16 and 2q8 groups and lower in the HDq12 group. Similar results for the proportions of 
participants gaining at least 10 letters, at least 5 letters, or any gain (> 0 letters) in BCVA from baseline were 
observed at Week 60. 
The numerical differences in the proportion of participants who lost at least 5 or 10 letters across the treatment 
groups were generally small, with the lowest proportions observed in the 2q8 group at Week 48 as well as at 
Week 60. 
Proportions of participants losing at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 48 and Week 
60 
The proportion of participants who lost at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline was < 6.0% at Week 48 and 
< 7.0% at Week 60 in all 3 treatment groups, based on LOCF in the FAS can be seen in Table 9-16.

As  a  general  comment,  it  appears  that  like  for  Week  48  and  Week  60,  across  all  treatment  groups,  more 
participants gained letters in BCVA at Week 96, compared to those losing letters in BCVA. Although numerically 
slightly different, a similar proportion of patients in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups gained ≥ 10 letters or ≥ 15 
letters through Week 96 compared to the 2q8 group.   
The proportions of patients who gained ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline reached values > 20% at Week 20 
(2q8), Week 28 (HDq12) and Week 32 (HDq16), respectively, and remained at that level with similar values in 
all 3 treatment groups at Week 48 (20.7% to 22.1%), Week 60 (23.1% to 23.7%) and Week 96 (22.8% to 
23.9%). 
Proportion  of  participants  without  retinal  fluid  (total  fluid,  IRF,  and/or  SRF)  and  subRPE  fluid  in 
central subfield at Week 48 and Week 60 
The  proportion  of  participants  without  subRPE  fluid  in  central  subfield  at  Week  48  using  LOCF  in  the  FAS 
increased  to  values  >  90%  in  both  HD  treatment  groups  and  86.2%  in  the  2q8  group.  At  Week  60,  the 
proportion of participants without subRPE fluid in central subfield increased to values > 90% in all treatment 
groups (Table 9-17). 
The proportion of participants with both no subRPE fluid and  no retinal fluid (no IRF and no SRF) in central 
subfield increased from approximately 2% in each treatment group at baseline to proportions > 60% in both 
HD treatment groups and of 54.6% in the 2q8 group at Week 48.  
At  Week  60,  the  proportion  of  participants  with  both  no  subRPE  fluid  and  no  retinal  fluid  in  central  subfield 
increased further to values of approximately 69% to 71% in all treatment groups (Table 9-17).

In addition to the shortening of the intervals of IVT injections, some patients were eligible starting week 52 to 
extend up by 4 week the interval based on DRM criteria assessed in HD groups and at 60 weeks (patients in 
HDq12 group could be injected with a q16 interval and patients in HDq16 group could be injected with a q20 
interval). Moreover, the sponsor proposed the following wording for the posology in the SmPC: 
“4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Eylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 8 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 0.07 ml solution. 
Eylea treatment is initiated with 1 injection per month for 3 consecutive doses. Injection intervals may then be 
extended  up  to  every  16  weeks  based  on  the  physician’s  judgement  of  visual  and/or  anatomic  outcomes. 
Subsequently, the treatment intervals may be further adjusted based on the physician’s judgement of visual 
and/or anatomic outcomes up to every 5 months. 
Eylea  treatment  intervals  of  1  month  for  more  than  3  consecutive  doses  have  not  been  studied.  There  are 
limited data for treatment intervals longer than 5 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

There is no requirement for monitoring between injections. Based on the physician’s judgement the schedule 
of monitoring visits may be more frequent than the injection visits.” 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  issued  from  PULSAR  study  are  very  limited  to  support  the  5  months  injection 
interval during the maintenance phase and more data was requested.  
The applicant provides additional exposure data regarding the 20q dosing interval. Through Week 96, up to 
47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or longer intervals in the PULSAR and 
PHOTON  study  respectively.  Numerically,  this  corresponds  to  a total  of  185 patients  completed  at  least  one 
q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24. 
Moreover, all participants in HD groups were eligible for dose interval shortening (to a minimum of q8) as of 
Week 16 or extension (by 4-week increments) as of Week 52 according to the pre-specified DRM criteria. Due 
to this option for treatment individualization, by the end of Year 2, the HDq12 and HDq16 groups were allocated 
into a range of treatment intervals from 8 to 24 weeks. No patient had yet completed a 24-week interval by 
Week 96, but patients could have completed one or two q20 intervals. As for the requested 2-year data, the 
Applicant  provided  exposure  details  for  patients  who  extended  their  treatment  interval  to  q20  or  longer. 
Through Week 96, up to 47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or longer 
intervals in the PULSAR and PHOTON study respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 patients 
completed at least one q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24. 
Thus, in both studies, a high proportion of patients in the HD groups (48% and 56% respectively in the PHOTON 
and PULSAR HDq16 groups) extended their treatment intervals to q20 or longer while only a very few patients 
extended to intervals of q20 required a subsequent shortening of the treatment interval. However, even low, 
details on the reasons that lead to dosing interval shortening were needed.  
Further discussion was required on the absence of visits between two injections during the maintenance phase.

The Applicant provided some clarifications regarding the relevance of absence of visits between two injections 
during the maintenance phase for patients allocated to HD intervals. 
As discussed above, considering that the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment regimens have overall demonstrated 
BCVA gains non-inferior compared to 2q8, it is supported that modification of treatment intervals is not needed 
between doses and therefore monitoring visits are not a requirement for these regimens. Nevertheless, in line 
with the current practice regarding aflibercept 2 mg and the information included in the SmPC for aflibercept 2 
mg, the Applicant proposes that event for the HD intervals, the frequency of monitoring visits may be higher 
than  the  dosing  frequency,  based  on  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician.  As  for  validated  regimen,  the 
applicant proposal to leave need for monitoring visits to the physician´s discretion seems to be acceptable. 
Issue could be considered as solved mainly on the basis that the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment regimens have 
overall demonstrated BCVA gains non-inferior compared to 2q8 at W96. 
The MAH was asked to should provide a Table that could clearly identify the patient’s dosing interval of 
treatment in each arm at Week 48 and 60 (q8, q12, q16 and q20) which is presented below.  
As noted above, the participant’s dosing intervals in each treatment arm at Week 48 for PULSAR study 
indicated that: 
In the HDq12 arm (N=316 Week 48 completers):  
•  251 participants (79.4%) maintained their originally assigned q12 dosing interval  
•  65 participants (20.6%) were shortened to q8. Of these:  
o  17 participants (5.4%) were shortened at Week 16 and  
o  25 participants (7.9%) were shortened at Week 20.  
o  The remaining 23 participants (7.3%) were shortened at later timepoints through Week 48, i.e. at 
Week or 32 or Week 44 
In the HDq16 arm (N=312 Week 48 completers):  
•  239 participants (76.6%) maintained their originally assigned q16

•  134 participants (43.1%) were extended to a q16 dosing interval until Week 60.  
•  126 participants (40.5%) were on a q12 dosing interval at Week 60. 
•  51 participants (16.4%) were on a q8 dosing interval at Week 60 
In the HDq16 arm (N=309 Week 60 completers): 
•  118 participants (38.2%) were extended to a q20 dosing interval until Week 60.  
•  116 participants (37.5%) were on a q16 dosing interval at Week 60.  
•  42 participants (13.6%) were on a q12 dosing interval at Week 60.  
•  33 participants (10.7%) were on a q8 dosing interval at Week 60 
PHOTON study 
In the HDq12 arm (N=300 Week 48 completers):  
•  273 participants (91.0%) maintained their originally assigned q12 dosing. 
•  27 participants (9.0%) shortened from q12 to q8.  
o  3 participants (1.0%) were shortened at Week 16,  
o  12 participants (4.0%) were shortened at Week 20,  
o  The remaining 12 participants (4.0%) were shortened at later timepoints through Week 48, i.e. at 
Week or 32 or Week 44. 
In the HDq16 arm (N=156 Week 48 completers): 
•  139 participants (89.1%) maintained their originally assigned q16 dosing interval  
•  11 participants (7.1%) were shortened to q12;  
•  6 participants (3.8%) were shortened to q8.  
o  1 participant (0.6%) were shortened from q16 to q8 at Week 16,  
o  3 participants (1.9%) were shortened from q16 to q8 at Week 20,  
o 
the  remaining  2  participants  (1.3%)  were  shortened  from  q16  to  q12  at  Week  24,  and  further 
shortened to q8 in a subsequent step through Week 48 
In the HDq12 arm (N=289 Week 60 completers):  
•  128 participants (44.3%) were extended to a q16 dosing interval until Week 60.

•  138 participants (47.8%) were on a q12 dosing interval at Week 60. 
•  23 participants (8.0%) were on a q8 dosing interval at Week 60. 
In the HDq16 arm (N=152 Week 60 completers, see Figure 25):  
•  55 participants (36.2%) were extended to a q20 dosing interval until Week 60.  
•  77 participants (50.7%) were on a q16 dosing interval at Week 60.  
•  12 participants (7.9%) were on a q12 dosing interval at Week 60. 
•  8 participants (5.3%) were on a q8 dosing interval at Week 60 
The Applicant has adequately provided the requested patient’s dosing interval of treatment in each arm at 
Week 48 and 60 (q8, q12, q16 and q20) in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies. 
For PULSAR study, it appears that the majority of patients were rather maintained on their originally assigned 
interval or extended to a greater interval (eg, from q12 to q16 interval) both on W48 and W60 completers. 
However, even low, it should be noted that a certain proportion of patients were shortened their treatment 
interval (less than 20% in both HDq12 and HDq16 arm at W48 and W60). In the meantime, and as discussed 
above, a proportion of patients were extended from their original assignment (43.1% of HDq12 arm were 
extended to a q16 dosing interval and 38.2% of HDq16 arm were extended to a q20 dosing interval)  
For PHOTON study, the proportion of patients who maintained their original interval was greater with around 
90% of patients maintained their originally assigned q12 or q16 dosing at W48 and W60 and around 10% 
who shortened the originally assigned interval. In parallel, 43.3% and 36.2% of patients were extended to a 
q16 and q20 dosing interval for HDq12 and HDq16 arm respectively. 
PHOTON Study - 21091, VGFTe-HD-DME-1934 
Methods 
Study design 
This phase 2/3, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, study aim to investigate the efficacy, safety, of IVT 
administration of aflibercept 8 mg (HD) versus aflibercept 2 mg in participants with DME involving the center 
of the macula (Figure 1 and 2). 
The study consists of a screening/baseline period, a treatment period with duration of 92 weeks, and an end 
of study visit at Week 96. An extension of the study is planned starting Week 96 for 60 weeks with an end of 
study visit at week 156. 
Subjects with nAMD were randomized to receive IVT injections in the study eye of HD or 2 mg in a 1:2:1 ratio 
to 3 parallel treatment groups:  
• 2q8: aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks, after 5 initial injections doses at 4-week intervals.  
• HDq12: aflibercept 8 mg administered every 12 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals. Participants 
in  this  group  can  move  to  q8  dosing  regimen  at  Weeks  16  or  20,  or  up  to  q16  dosing  regimen  at  week  52 
according to pre-specified criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 92/235 
 
 
 
• HDq16: aflibercept 8 mg administered every 16 weeks, after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals. Participants 
in this group can move to q8 dosing regimen at Weeks 16 or 20, to q12 dosing regimen at Week 24, or up to 
q20 dosing regimen at week 52 according to pre-specified criteria.

Study participants  
The study population consisted of naïve male and female of ≥ 18 years patients with DME. 
Key inclusion criteria 
1. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
2. DME with central involvement in the study eye (CRT ≥ 300 µm) 
3. BCVA ETDRS letter score 78 to 24 
Key exclusion criteria 
1. Evidence of macular edema due to any cause other than diabetes mellitus in either eye 
2. Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the study eye 
3. IOP ≥ 25 mmHg in the study eye 
4. IVT anti-VEGF treatment in the study eye within 12 weeks of screening 
5. Uncontrolled BP (systolic > 160 mm Hg or diastolic > 95 mm Hg) 
6. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c > 12%) 
The proposed study treatment compared to the current treatment in patients with DME was supported by the 
CHMP scientific advice. The chosen study population and related exams all along the study are similar the one 
from the randomised phase III VIVID and VISTA, which was the basis for the approval of aflibercept in DME 
patients which is deemed acceptable.  
Treatments 
In  PHOTON  study,  patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:2:1  ratio  to  receive  monotherapy  with  either  2  mg 
aflibercept  (administered  every  8  weeks,  after  5  initial  injections  at  4-week  intervals)  or  aflibercept  8  mg 
administered every 12 or 16 weeks, after 5 initial injections at 4-week intervals. Participants in these groups 
can move to q8 dosing regimen at Weeks 16 or 20, q12 dosing regimen at Week 24, or up to or up to q16 
(HDq12 group), q20 (HDq16 group) dosing regimen at week 52, if both criteria were met: 
° >10 letter loss in BCVA from week 12 in association with persistent or worsening DME 
° >50 μm increase in CRT from week 12 (It should be noted that the change in CRT for these criteria will be 
assessed at the site.) 
Each vial was for single eye use only. No dosing modification for an individual patient is allowed. 
Permitted concomitant treatments:  
Participants may not receive any standard or investigational agents for treatment of their DME in the study eye 
other  than  IVT  aflibercept  as  specified  in  this  protocol  until  they  have  completed  the  end  of  study/early 
termination  visit  assessments.  This  includes  medications  administered  locally  (e.g.,  IVT,  by  juxtascleral  or 
periorbital routes), as well as those administered systemically with the intent of treating the fellow eye. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 94/235 
 
 
 
Patients may receive any medication considered necessary for the participant’s welfare, and that is not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of the study intervention, may be given at the discretion of the investigator. 
Any medication or vaccine (including any sedation, anesthesia, eye drops used for the study procedures, blood-
derived  products,  prescription  or  over-the-counter  medicines,  probiotics,  vitamins,  and  herbal  supplements) 
that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded. 
If the fellow eye has DME, or any other approved indication, 2 mg aflibercept will be allowed. Once the fellow 
eye receives only aflibercept 2 mg therapy during the study. 
If a pre-treatment concomitant medication is administered in the study eye before injection (e.g., antibiotic, 
topical anesthetic), it must be administered for sham procedures as well. 
Dose delays or modifications: Assessments for dose regimen modification is to be performed in all participants 
at all visits starting from Week 16. Based on these assessments, participants in the HD groups may have their 
treatment intervals shortened or extended. The minimum interval between injections will be 8 weeks, which is 
considered a rescue regimen for participants randomized to HD aflibercept who are unable to tolerate a dosing 
interval greater than every 8 weeks. Participants in the aflibercept 2 mg group will remain on fixed q8 dosing 
throughout the study until the end of masked study visit at Week 96 (i.e., will not have modifications of their 
treatment intervals regardless of the outcomes of the dose regimen modification assessments). 
Treatment was to be discontinued if any of the following reasons applied (but were not limited to): 
• Relevant laboratory abnormality or SAEs, if the sponsor or investigator sees this as medical reason to warrant 
withdrawal. 
• AE (ocular or nonocular) that, from the participant’s or the investigator’s view, is potent enough to require 
withdrawal from the study. The investigator must notify the sponsor immediately if a participant is withdrawn 
because of an AE/SAE. 
• At the discretion of the treating investigator. The development of conditions, which would have prevented a 
participant’s entry into the study according to the selection criteria, is no reason per se for withdrawal. However, 
the withdrawal in such cases remains at the discretion of the treating investigator. 
•  Decision  by  the  investigator  or  sponsor  that  termination  is  in  the  participant’s  best  medical  interest  or 
administrative decision for a reason other than an AE/SAE. 
• A female participant becomes pregnant.  
• Lost to follow-up.  
• Decision by the sponsor to halt the entire study. 
• If any treatment for DME other than study interventions is given in the study eye. 
• Systemic anti-angiogenic agents were taken by the participant during the study. 
• If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the participant's well-being. 
• At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (e.g., obvious non-compliance or 
safety concerns).

Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug should be encouraged to remain in the study. Those 
who agree and do not withdraw from the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits 
per the visit schedule. 
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked 
to complete study assessments.

As discussed for the PULSAR study in patient with nAMD, the primary objective and endpoint of PHOTON study 
were also discussed during the SA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/277944/2019) and concerns was raised regarding the 
choice of an endpoint at 48 week in view of the increased intervals and the need for at least 64 week data, 
preferably supplemented with some 2-year data is foreseen to support the Q12 and/or Q16 dosing regimens 
as well as long-term safety. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  of  640  subjects  (2x160+320)  was  adequately  estimated  with  and  included  19%  possible 
dropout. The HDq12 dose regiment had twice the size of the two other doses due to regulatory requirements. 
It was based on the non-inferiority of the 8 mg dose-regimens aiming to consent a loss of efficacy over the 2 
mg control regimen at 48 weeks not exceeding 4 characters of the EDTRS chart (i.e. one line of the chart), 
with 0.025 type-one error and with more than 90% power to achieve non-inferiority for both dose. 
Randomization 
The randomization was performed with an interactive web system. The 3 active arms (2q8, 8q12 and 8q16) 
were distributed in the trial according to the ratio 1:2:1, showing at the randomisation level, the preference of 
the sponsor to the high dose regimen every 12 weeks enrolling twice as more subjects as in the 2 other dose 
regimens. Patients were stratified on the geographical region (Japan vs Rest of the World) and the CRT baseline 
(<400µm vs ≥400 µm) and prior DME treatment (yes/no). 
The EU population constituted the largest cohort of subjects included in the trial (39%), followed mainly by 
cohorts from North America (30%) and Asia (23%), representing a total of 92% of the study population. 
Homogeneous treatment responses in these 3 major subgroups should be expected. 
Blinding (masking) 
Overall, relatively the same measures are followed as in the PULSAR Study. 
Sham injections were aimed to mask the difference between dose regimen schedules in patients. In addition, 
the unmasked investigator administering the study drug did not participate in any efficacy or safety endpoint 
evaluations apart from the reporting of AEs and device-related AEs/SAEs/deficiencies relating to filter needle, 
injection needle, or syringe during injection procedure and post-injection assessment. Therefore, no impact on 
study integrity is expected. 
An overview of the masked and unmasked site personnel is presented in Table 1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 97/235 
 
 
Unmasking of treatment assignment for a patient could have been necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg, pregnancy) and when a treatment decision is contingent on knowing 
the patient’s treatment assignment. Study drug had to be discontinued for patients whose treatment has been 
unmasked. 
Additionally, no emergency unblinding was required during the study.  
Statistical methods 
• Populations for statistical analyses 
The full analysis set (FAS) was planned to include all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication; it was based on the treatment assigned to the patient at baseline (as randomized). FAS was the 
primary analysis set for efficacy endpoints. 
The per protocol set (PPS) was planned to include all patients in the FAS who had a baseline and at least 1 
post-baseline assessment of BCVA, and did not have any relevant important protocol violations that affect the 
primary efficacy variable. The final determination on the exclusion of patients from the PPS was to be made on 
the masked data prior to the first database lock and described in a separate document. The PPS was used for 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 98/235 
 
 
 
supplementary analysis of change from baseline in BCVA (non-inferiority only) at week 48 (primary endpoint) 
and week 60 (key secondary endpoint). 
Treatment assignment was based on the treatment received (as treated). In general, the randomized treatment 
group was to be considered as the actual treatment group, unless the patient has not been treated at all after 
randomization. Isolated incorrect treatments did not constitute a change in the “as treated” assignment but 
were considered as intercurrent events. 
The safety analysis set (SAF) was including all randomized patients who received any study treatment; it was 
based  on  the  treatment  received  (as  treated).  Treatment  compliance/administration  and  all  clinical  safety 
variables were analyzed using the SAF. The safety analysis was performed on the observed safety data. 
The  efficacy  populations  of  analysis  are  acceptable,  except  for  PPS  which  was  planned  to  be  analysed  “as 
treated”  while  an  error  of  treatment  allocation  should  be  considered  as  a  major  deviation  to  the  protocol. 
However, it was not an issue in this trial where only one wrong treatment allocation was reported. 
• Definition of estimands 
The  estimand  was  specified  through  the  following  definitions  of  population,  variable,  treatment  condition, 
intercurrent events, and population-level summary:  
• Population: Defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All efficacy analyses were conducted using the FAS. 
• Variable: Change from baseline to week 48 in BCVA 
• Treatment  condition:  Intention  to  treat  with  HD  aflibercept  administered  every  12  weeks  (HDq12)  after  3 
initial monthly injections or every 16 weeks (HDq16) after 3 initial monthly injections each versus aflibercept 
2 mg administered every 8 weeks (2q8) after 5 initial monthly injections; dose regimen modifications did not 
affect patient's assigned ITT regimen. 
• Intercurrent  events:  Premature  discontinuation  from  treatment;  missed  injections;  use  of  prohibited 
medication; wrong study intervention administered, as displayed in Table 1. 
• Population-level summary: Difference in least-square (LS) mean change from baseline to week 48 in BCVA 
between HDq12 and 2q8 (and HDq16 and 2q8) resulting from a mixed-model for repeated measurements 
(MMRM). 
The  estimand  proposal  is  similar  to  the  Pulsar  trial  and  is  acceptable  with  the  same  interrogation  on  the 
hypothetical strategy which looks like the while on treatment strategy.

The following 2 hypotheses were tested in the primary analysis: 
• HDq12 was non-inferior to 2q8 regarding the mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 48 using a non-
inferiority margin of 4 letters: 
H10: μ1 ≤ μ0 – 4 vs. H11: μ1 > μ0 – 4, where μ0, μ1, were the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 
for 2q8 and HDq12, respectively. 
• HDq16 was non-inferior to 2q8 regarding the mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 48 using a non-
inferiority margin of 4 letters: 
H30: μ2 ≤ μ0 – 4 vs. H31: μ2 > μ0 – 4, where μ0, μ2 were the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 
for 2q8, and HDq16, respectively. 
For the analysis of the primary efficacy variable, a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) was used 
with baseline BCVA measurement as a covariate and treatment group (HDq16 vs. 2q8 and HDq12 vs. 2q8) and 
baseline  CRT  category  (<400  μm,  ≥400  μm),  prior  DME  treatment  (yes,  no),  geographical  region  (Rest  of 
world, Japan), and visit as fixed effects as well as terms for the interaction between baseline BCVA and visit 
and  for  the  interaction  between  treatment  and  visit.  A  Kenward-Roger  approximation  was  used  for  the 
denominator degrees of freedom. Further, an unstructured covariance structure was used. If the model did not 
converge, an appropriate covariance structure would be used instead. Only data up to Week 48 were used in 
this analysis.

The hierarchical procedure proposed to control for multiplicity hypothesis testing is endorsed. As in Pulsar, the 
hierarchy targets preferably the 8 mg every 12 weeks dose regimen (HDq12). If this regimen passed the non-
inferiority tests in BCVA at 48 and 60 weeks treatment, the HDq16 week regimen will be then tested in BCVA 
non-inferiority. The HDq12 dose regimen will be then tested for non-inferiority in DRSS score ≥ 2-step. If these 
steps are positively past, the high doses will be tested for superiority. 
• Control of Multiplicity 
The overall family-wise type 1 error was controlled at 0.025 (one-sided tests) for testing the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. Adjustment for multiple comparisons in the primary and key secondary endpoints were 
made with a hierarchical testing procedure. This approach allowed the confirmatory testing of a hypothesis at 
the  full  alpha  level  of  0.025  after  successful  rejection  of  the  hypotheses  which  were  ranked  higher  in  the 
hierarchy. The hypotheses were tested in the order as specified in Table 2 for G-SAP and EP-SAP, respectively.

• Subgroup analyses 
Analyses were performed in the following subgroups: 
• Sex: male, female 
• Age at enrollment: <55 years, ≥55 years to <65 years, ≥65 years to < 75 years, ≥75 years 
• Race (only subgroups with sufficient sample size): White, Black or African American, Asian 
• Ethnicity: Not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino 
• Baseline BCVA (≤73 letters, >73 letters) 
• Geographic region: Japan, Rest of the world 
• Baseline CRT category (<400 μm, ≥400 μm) 
• Prior DME treatment (yes, no) 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  using  the  same  model  as  the  one  mentioned  for  the  primary  analysis, 
except for those subgroups that were also stratification factors (geographic region, baseline CRT category, and 
prior DME treatment), where these terms were individually removed from the model (leaving the other 2 factors 
in).  
Regarding the subgroup analyses, the geographical region segmentation (Japan vs RoW), should be considered 
for sensitivity analyses. As for Pulsar trial, the primary analysis was reiterated using the region fixed effect, 
stratified as follows: Japan, Europe including Czech Rep, Germany, Hungary and UK, North America including 
Canada  and  USA  .  In  addition,  the  primary  endpoint  was  documented  in  the  European  and  North  America 
regions as mentioned above . 
As for Pulsar trial, a new geographical region analysis was requested. The main cohort in this trial comes from 
North America with 462 patients (70%), followed by Europe (19%) and Japan (11%). Results across the new 
segmentation of regions seem more consistent in the Photon trial with a non-inferiority confirmed in the North 
America subgroup. The smaller size of EU and Japan subgroups make their results a bit less reliable. 
• Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses included an analysis of covariance with missing data imputed by last observation carried 
forward (LOCF), a multiple imputation (MI) analysis, and a tipping point analysis; and supplementary analyses 
included an MMRM model for the primary endpoint using the PPS.

The hierarchical procedure proposed to control for multiplicity hypothesis testing is endorsed. As in PULSAR, 
the hierarchy targets preferably the 8 mg every 12 weeks dose regimen (HDq12). If this regimen passed the 
non-inferiority tests in BCVA at 48 and 60 weeks treatment, the HDq16 week regimen will be then tested in 
BCVA non-inferiority. The HDq12 dose regimen will be then tested for non-inferiority in DRSS score ≥ 2-step. 
If these steps are positively past, the high doses will be tested for superiority. 
Results  
Participant flow  
There  were  660  enrolled  participants  (970  patients  screened  with  310  screening  failure)  at  138  sites  in  7 
countries (Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States). Most 
participants in each of the 3 groups (2q8: 94.0%, HDq12: 91.2%, and HDq16: 95.1%) completed their Week 
48 analysis visit. The disposition of participants through Week 60 and further through Week 60 is presented in

Recruitment 
Date first subject randomized: 29 Jun 2020 
Date last subject completed Week 60 / End of Study Visit: 07 Oct 2022.  
The study was conducted at a total of 7 countries (Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, United 
Kingdom, and the United States). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 36 (35.1%) participants reported important protocol deviations (Table 5). The most frequent (≥ 5%) 
important  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  the  initiation  of  study  procedures  without  re-consenting 
participants to the amended Informed consent (17 participants) and followed by initiation of study procedures 
without consenting/prior to consenting of participants to the ICF (9 participants overall). Globally, the frequency 
of participants with important protocol deviations through Week 60 is considered similar across the treatment 
groups. 
Other protocol deviation were related to the COVID-19 pandemic (in 17 patients without any exclusion in the 
Week 60 database).

brolucizumab, pegaptanib sodium) in the study eye within 12 weeks (84 days) of the screening visit, but this 
deviation was not captured in the PD listing 
• 1 participant met exclusion criteria #1 for the dense PK substudy: Prior treatment with IVT aflibercept in the 
fellow eye within 12 weeks (84 days) of the screening visit, but this deviation was not captured in the PD listing

Amendment to the protocol 
Amendment 1 (06 Dec 2019) 
The  purpose  of  this  amendment  was  to  address  feedback  received  from  European  Union  (EU)  regulatory 
agencies as part of the Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure (VHP). The requested revisions include: addition of 
information on criteria for study and study drug discontinuation, specification that collection of adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin at the time of informed consent, clarification on assessment 
of laboratory values as AEs, clarification of some of the statistical considerations, and other minor revisions as 
requested. 
Amendment 2 (14 Feb 2020) 
The primary purpose of this amendment was to update details of the study design, combining rescue treatment 
with  Dose  Regimen  Modification  (DRM)  assessments  in  both  year  1  and  year  2.  Patients  in  the  HDq12  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 106/235 
 
 
 
HDq16 groups will now be eligible for a rescue regimen (8 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks) beginning at week 
16. 
Amendment 3 (07 May 2020) 
The primary purposes for this amendment were to clarify the machine-specific values for CRT (measured on 
spectral  domain  optical  coherence  tomography  [SD-OCT])  defined  in  the  inclusion  criteria  for  the  reading 
center’s determination of eligibility, and to describe the continuity plan for conducting clinical study activities 
and study oversight activities during the public health emergency due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19). 
Amendment 4 (28 Apr 2022) 
The primary purpose for this amendment was to simplify and extend the confirmatory testing hierarchy: 
To  remove  the  initial  Bonferroni-based  split  of  the  overall  significance  level  (which  had  been  introduced 
originally to allow simultaneous testing of the 2 hypotheses (8 mg aflibercept every 12 weeks [HDq12] vs 2 
mg  aflibercept  every  8  weeks  [2q8]  and  8  mg  aflibercept  every  16  weeks  [HDq16]  vs  2q8)  of  the  primary 
endpoint at a significance level of 0.0125 [1-sided] each) and to assign the full significance level of 0.025 (1-
sided) to the first hypothesis (HDq12 vs 2q8). The reason for this change is to adjust the testing sequence to 
the perceived clinical probability of success, ie, since HDq12 is more likely to succeed than HDq16 (due to the 
higher dosing frequency after the loading phase). 
1. To remove the subsequent splitting of the remaining alpha levels between 2 hypotheses, and replace it by 
a simpler hierarchical testing procedure in both the global statistical analysis plan (G-SAP) and the statistical 
analysis plan for EMA and PMDA (EP-SAP). 
This change allows sequential testing of hypotheses at the full significance level after successful rejection of 
the hypotheses which are ranked higher in the hierarchy. The reason for this change is to prioritize testing of 
hypotheses which are deemed to be clinically more relevant. 
2. To allow formal statistical testing for superiority of the change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) at week 48 (and week 60, in the EP-SAP only) that controls the overall family-wise type 1 error. The 
formal statistical testing for superiority is added at the end of the revised testing hierarchy. Hence the testing 
hierarchy is extended.  
3. To remove the endpoint of “Proportion of patients without retinal fluid at the foveal center at week 12” as a 
key secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy (it remains as a secondary endpoint assessed at week 48). 
Based on recent data from another, completed study, it was determined that week 12 is not a reasonable time 
point  to  assess  this  endpoint.  Analysis  of  this  endpoint  will  be  more  informative  at  week  48  after  a  year  of 
treatment. 
Of note, the updated confirmatory testing hierarchy still controls the overall family-wise type 1 error at 0.025 
level (1-sided). These changes will be implemented after the end of enrolment but before database lock and 
before any unmasking occurs. 
Amendment 5 (14 Sept 2022) 
The primary purpose for this amendment was to add an optional 1 year extension phase to the current study 
at  select  countries  and  sites.  During  the  extension  phase,  all  patients  will  be  treated  with  HD  aflibercept 
including those originally assigned to the aflibercept 2 mg every 8 week (2q8) group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 107/235 
 
 
The  treatment  intervals  for  all  groups  will  be  adjusted  according  to  individual  responses  as  determined  by 
extension phase dose regimen modification (E-DRM) criteria. 
Baseline data 
Baseline data are presented in Table 7. 
The  following  differences  were  noted  by  the  MAH  between  the  2q8  group  and  the  pooled  HD  groups  (these 
characteristics were similar between the HDq12 and HDq16 groups): 
•  Although  most  participants  in  all  treatment  groups  were  between  the  ages  of  55  and  75,  slightly  more 
participants younger than age 55 were in the pooled HD groups compared to the 2q8 group (23.4% vs 17.4%, 
respectively). 
• More participants in all treatment groups were male; however, more males were in the pooled HD groups 
compared to the 2q8 group (62.9% vs 55.1%, respectively). 
• A history of cerebrovascular disease was less prevalent in the pooled HD groups compared to the 2q8 group 
(6.3% vs 11.4%, respectively). However, across all treatment groups, most participants did not have a history 
of cerebrovascular disease.

Baseline Disease Characteristics in the Study Eye 
Demographics and baseline characteristics appears to be unbalanced across the groups for the following 
groups: age category (<55, ≥ 55 to < 65), race (Black or African American, White), Hemoglobin A1c at 
baseline category (percentage of patients with ≤8% and ≥ 8%), patients with history of cerebrovascular 
disease, history of ischaemic heart disease and diabetes type II (Non/insulin dependent).

Medical History 
The ocular medical and surgical history in the study eye mostly reported (> 10%) were AMD, Cataract, cataract 
nuclear,  cataract  operation  and  retinal  laser  coagulation.  Overall,  baseline  data  for  patient’s  medical  and 
surgical history were comparable across the 3 groups, except for the cataract history, as well for patients with 
vitreous detachment and intraocular lens implant (Table 9). 
Moreover, non-ocular medical and surgical history in the study eye baseline data presented in Table 9 were not 
comparable across the 3 groups for the following SOC: metabolism and nutrition disorders (Hyperlipidaemia, 
Hypercholesterolaemia,  and  diabetes  mellitus),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (gastroesophageal  reflux  disease), 
immune  system  disorders  (seasonal  allergy  and  drug  hypersensitivity)  and  endocrine  disorders 
(hypothyroidism).

The  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  baseline  disease  characteristics 
discrepancies in PHOTON study (in patients of different age category (<55, ≥ 55 to < 65), race (Black or African 
American, White), percentage of Hemoglobin A1c at baseline category (≤8% and ≥ 8%), patients with history

of cerebrovascular disease, history of ischaemic heart disease and diabetes type II (Non/insulin dependent), 
BCVA  category  (≤73  and  ≥  73  letters)  CRT,  DRSS,  cataract  history,  vitreous  detachment,  intraocular  lens 
implant,  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (Hyperlipidaemia,  Hypercholesterolaemia,  diabetes  mellitus), 
gastrointestinal disorders (gastroesophageal reflux disease), immune system disorders (seasonal allergy and 
drug hypersensitivity) and endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism)).   
Regarding the age, in the age group < 55 there were 17.4%, 23.5% and 23.3% subjects and in the ≥ 55 to < 
65 group there were 37.7%, 32.9% and 33.1% subjects in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 group respectively. 
Based on the mean and median age including the standard deviation, the Applicant concluded that there was 
a similar distribution of age for the treatment groups and thus the minor numerical differences at baseline with 
regards to age groups are not considered clinically relevant. Due to the lower sample size per subgroup these 
did  show  some  minor  variability  but  did  not  reveal  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  subgroup 
populations and the total population. 
For the ethnicity and Hemoglobin A1c differences, the observed imbalance among these subgroups is due to 
their  relatively  small  sample  sizes  and  is  therefore  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Indeed,  the  Applicant 
considers  that  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are  calculated  based  on  the  entire  population  (and  not 
subgroups), such differences are judged as not clinically relevant. 
Regarding  the  Medical  history,  the  numerical  imbalances  in  the  distribution  is  also  explained  by  the  small 
number of patients and are not considered clinically relevant 
Numbers analysed 
The  number  of  participants  included  in  each  analysis  set  and  a  summary  of  participants  excluded  from  the 
respective analysis sets is provided in Table 6.  
Two  participants  who  did  not  receive  treatment  were  excluded  from  all  analyses  (SAF,  FAS,  and  PPS;  1 
participant each in HDq12 and HDq16). An additional 9 participants were excluded from the PPS for the reasons 
presented in Table 6.

Outcomes and estimation 
Overview of Hierarchical Testing Procedure 
Table  18  provides  a  summary  of  the  results  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  included  in  the 
hierarchical testing procedure according to the EP-SAP. 
The first 5 confirmatory tests in the hierarchy (H10, H20, H30, H40, H50) were statistically significant at the 
alpha level of 0.025 (1-sided tests). Therefore, the following is concluded by the MAH: 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint  “change 
from baseline in BCVA at week 48” and with regard to the key secondary endpoint "change from baseline BCVA 
at week 60" 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq16  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint  “change 
from baseline in BCVA at week 48” and with regard to the key secondary endpoint "change from baseline in 
BCVA at week 60" 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  key  secondary  endpoint 
“proportion of participants with a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRSS score at week 48” 
The confirmatory test for non-inferiority of HDq16 vs. 2q8 (H60) in the key secondary endpoint “proportion of 
participants with a ≥ 2 step improvement in DRSS score at week 48” did not meet the non-inferiority margin 
of 15%; therefore, the hierarchical testing procedure was stopped at the H60 test. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 115/235 
 
 
 
For the sake of completeness, when applying the hierarchical testing procedure defined in the G-SAP, the first 
3 confirmatory tests in the hierarchy (H10, H30, H50) were statistically significant at the alpha level of 0.025 
(1-sided tests) at week 48. 
Therefore, the following was concluded by the MAH: 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint  “change 
from baseline in BCVA at week 48” 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq16  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint  “change 
from baseline in BCVA at week 48” 
•  Treatment  of  participants  with  HDq12  is  non-inferior  to  2q8  with  regard  to  the  key  secondary  endpoint 
“proportion of participants with a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRSS score” 
The non-inferiority in BCVA of individual high doses over the control dose is formally demonstrated at 48 and 
60 weeks of treatment in the ITT population, as well as the non-inferiority in DRSS score ≥ 2-step for the 
HDq12 at 48 weeks of treatment. No superiority can be claimed over the control dose for individual high 
doses.

Primary endpoint analysis 
Change from Baseline in BCVA (as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score) 
The primary objective of this study was to determine if treatment with higher dose aflibercept at intervals of 
12 or 16 weeks provided non-inferior BCVA compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks.  
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA (as measured by ETDRS letter score) at week 48. 
A key secondary endpoint (as per the EP-SAP) was the change from baseline in BCVA (as measured by ETDRS 
letter score) at week 60. 
Change from Baseline in BCVA (as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score) at Week 48  
Both  HDq12  and  HDq16  demonstrated  non-inferiority  to  2q8  with  respect  to  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
(change from baseline in BCVA at week 48; H10 and H30 in the statistical testing hierarchy) using the non-
inferiority margin of 4 letters with LS mean change from baseline in BCVA of 8.10 letters (HDq12) and 7.23 
letters  (HDq16)  versus  8.67  letters  in  the  2q8  group  (Table  14).  The  differences  in  LS  mean  changes  from 
baseline  in  BCVA  (95%  CI)  were  -0.57  (-  2.26,  1.13)  and  -1.44  (-3.27,  0.39)  for  HDq12  and  HDq16, 
respectively compared to 2q8 (Table 14). The p-values for the non-inferiority test at a margin of 4 letters were 
<0.0001  (related  to  H10)  for  HDq12  vs.  2q8,  and  0.0031  (related  to  H30)  for  HDq16  vs.  2q8.  The  lower 
confidence limits were greater than -4, allowing the conclusion of non-inferiority at week 48 timepoint.  
The non-inferiority tests regarding the BCVA changes from baseline was first performed by the MAH for the 
primary endpoint in HDq12 group (H10) at Week 48, followed by the non-inferiority test for the key secondary 
endpoint  in  HDq12  Week  60  (H20)  and  continued  with  the  non-inferiority  test  for  the  primary  endpoint  in 
HDq16 (H30) at Week 48, and finally the key secondary endpoint in HDq16 at Week 60 (H40). 
Results of the analysis in the PPS were consistent with the FAS (Table 14.2.1.2) and LS mean change from 
baseline in BCVA by visit in the PPS was also consistent with the FAS (Figure 14.2.1.2 of the r-14238 report 
section).

Change from Baseline in BCVA (as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score) at Week 60 
Both  HDq12  and  HDq16  demonstrated  non-inferiority  to  2q8  with  respect  to  this  key  secondary  endpoint 
(change from baseline in BCVA at week 60) using the non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with LS mean change 
from baseline in BCVA of 8.52 letters (HDq12) and 7.64 letters (HDq16) versus 9.40 letters in the 2q8 group 
(Table 15). The differences in LS mean changes from baseline in BCVA (95% CI) were: -0.88 (-2.67, 0.91) and 
-1.76 (-3.71, 0.19) for HDq12 and HDq16, respectively, compared to 2q8. The p-values for the non-inferiority 
test at a margin of 4 letters were 0.0003 (related to H20) for HDq12 vs. 2q8, and 0.0122 (related to H40) for 
HDq16 vs. 2q8. The lower confidence limits were greater than -4, allowing the conclusion of non-inferiority at 
week 60 timepoint. 
The mean changes from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter score by visit through week 60 using 
OC, are graphically displayed in Figure 3; the corresponding LS mean changes from baseline in BCVA using 
MMRM  in  the  FAS,  are  displayed  in  Figure  4.  The  mean  increases  in  BCVA  over  time  were  generally  similar 
across all groups, with small fluctuations consistent with the dosing intervals.

Sensitivity Analysis for Change from Baseline in BCVA Score at Week 48 and Week 60 
The results of the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint for assessing non-inferiority using an 
ANCOVA with LOCF and ANCOVA with MI were consistent with the primary analysis and are presented in Tables 
14.2.1.3 and 14.2.1.4 for week 48 and Tables 14.2.1.3a and 14.2.1.4a for week 60.

In order to check robustness of the results if the missing data are not MAR (missing at random), a tipping point 
analysis was conducted based on the MI analysis and the results are provided in Table 14.2.1.5 of the r-14238 
report section for week 48. The results of this analysis showed that the smallest shift parameter (delta) used 
as penalty for participants with missing data in the HD groups, for which non-inferiority could not be shown 
anymore (with a 1-sided t-test at a significance level of 0.025), ie, the “tipping point” that significantly reversed 
the analysis result, was delta= -11 letters for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and delta = -7 letters for HDq16 vs. 2q8 at week 
48.  
The  “tipping  point”  values  of  -11  letters  and  -7  letters,  requiring  such  a  large  difference  in  BCVA  between 
HDq12 and HDq16 vs. 2q8, respectively, did not seem plausible at week 48. Therefore, the primary analysis of 
non-inferiority conclusion based on MMRM method was robust to the departure of the MAR (missing at random) 
assumption.  The  same  analyses  have  been  performed  by  the  MAH  at  week  60  and  are  supportive  (Tables 
14.2.1.3a to 14.2.1.5a of the r-14238 report section). 
Subgroup Analysis of Change from Baseline in BCVA Score at Week 48 and Week 60 (MMRM) 
Subgroup analyses were performed by the MAH for change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 and week 60 by 
sex,  age  group,  race,  ethnicity,  baseline  BCVA,  geographic  region,  baseline  CRT  category,  and  prior  DME 
treatment (Tables 14.2.1.9 to 14.2.1.16 for week 48 and Tables 14.2.1.9a to 14.2.1.16a for week 60). 
In the results presented for the following subgroups discrepancies in PHOTON study were noted in patients of 
≥65 - <75 years, Black or African American and with a BCVA ≥73 letters across the 3 treatment arms at Week 
48 and 60. However, given the smaller size of these subgroups, the validity of these comparisons appeared 
limited.

Overall, the primary and key secondary endpoint criteria, to know, the change from baseline in BCVA measured 
by  the  ETDRS  letter  score  at  Week  48  and  60  (non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  HDq12  and  HDq16 
dosing  regimen  to  the  current  authorized  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  2q8  dosing  regimen)  is  considered  to  be 
statistically met (95% credible interval for treatment difference with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with 
LS mean change from baseline in BCVA to Week 48) and fruher supported by the sensitivy analysis.

As presented in the initial application, both HDq12 and HDq16 demonstrated non-inferiority to 2q8 with respect 
to  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  48)  as  well  as  the  key  secondary 
endpoint (change from baseline in BCVA at Week 60) using the non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with LS mean 
change from baseline in BCVA.   
Based on the table and figure above, consistency was shown also for the exploratory efficacy BCVA endpoint 
at Week 96 with pairwise differences in LS means (95% CI), based on the MMRM model, of 0.45 letters (-1.55, 
2.45) for HDq12 vs. 2q8 and -1.11 letters (-3.27, 1.05) for HDq16 vs. 2q8. Indeed, both point estimates are 
comparable to those observed at Week 48 and Week 60 
The  LS  mean  of  BCVA  gains  were  stable  over  time  and  similar  across  all  groups,  with  minor  numerical 
differences not being considered as clinically relevant.  
Secondary key endpoint analysis 
Proportion of Participants With a ≥ 2-Step Improvement in DRSS Score at Week 48 
As the statistical tests ranked higher in the EP-SAP testing hierarchy were significant for both HD groups (ie, 
the  statistical  tests  H10,  H20,  H30  and  H40),  the  test  sequence  could  be  continued  with  testing  the  key 
secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  proportion  of  participants  with  ≥  2-step  improvement  in  DRSS  score  (as 
assessed by the central reading center) at week 48 (ie, H50 and H60). 
HDq12 was non-inferior to 2q8 with respect to this endpoint. However, this could not be shown for the HDq16

Subgroup Analysis of Participants With a ≥ 2-Step Improvement in DRSS at Week 48 and 60 
Subgroup analyses were performed for participants with a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRSS score at week 48 
and week 60 by sex, age group, race, ethnicity, baseline BCVA, geographic region, baseline CRT category, and 
prior DME treatment and are presented in Tables 14.2.2.5 to 14.2.2.12 for week 48 and Tables 14.2.2.5a to 
14.2.2.13a for week 60 (LOCF –FAS). Discrepancies in PHOTON study regarding the improvement of ≥2-Step 
in DRSS Score in the HD groups compared to the 2q8 group were observed for the following subgroups: <50 
years, ≥ 55- < 65 years, ≥ 65 to < 75 years, males, females, White, Asian, with a baseline BCVA ≤ 73 letters 
or ≥ 73 letters, and CRT  <400 micron or ≥ 400 micron at baseline subgroups. However, given the smaller size 
of these subgroups, the validity of these comparisons appeared limited.

The key secondary endpoint appears to be statistically met in the HDq12 arm but not in the HDq16 and the 
sensitivity  analyses  supported  the  results  at  week  48  and  60  (PHOTON  study).  Additionally,  results  tend  to 
differ in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups and some secondary and exploratory endpoints results tend to stand 
out more than others between groups. The MAH was asked to discuss the impact of those data and their clinical 
relevance on the dosing regimen (HDq16) proposed in the SmPC in DME patients.

In response, The Applicant concluded that all treatment arms achieved similar functional benefits. Differences 
in  structural  endpoints  were  mostly  associated  with  injection  timing  and  did  not  translate  into  clinically 
meaningful differences in quality of life or visual acuity. 
The  eligibility  criteria  of  the  PHOTON  study  aimed  to  include  an  informative  population  in  terms  of  DME 
assessment, which does not equate the one selected for DRSS assessment. In PHOTON, despite the limitations 
in study design, the evaluation of DRSS was included in the context of the fact that aflibercept 2 mg is in the 
US approved not only for the treatment of DME, but also for the treatment of DR. Therefore, evaluating the 
effects  of  aflibercept  8  mg  was  considered  relevant  for  that  territory.  The  key  secondary  endpoint  of  the 
proportion  of  participants  with  a  ≥  2-step  improvement  in  DRSS  score  at  Week  48  was  pre-specified  to 
potentially support an indication of aflibercept 8 mg for treatment of DR in the US. This endpoint was tested 
with a non-inferiority margin of 15% which was met by the HDq12 arm (adjusted difference 1.98%, 95% CI -
6.61,  10.57)  but  not  by  the  HDq16  arm  (adjusted  difference  -7.52%,  95%  CI  -16.88,  1.84).  however, 
considering that the primary endpoint showed that BCVA improvement as a direct effect of DME treatment was 
non-inferior for HDq12 and HDq16 compared to 2q8, the Applicant concluded that the effect on DRSS stage 
improvement does not correlate with the effect on DME, and improvements in DRSS are not a prerequisite for 
vision improvements in DME. 
Other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints analysis 
Proportion of Participants Gaining ≥ 15 Letters in BCVA from Baseline  
Week 48 
The proportion of participants who gained ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline to week 48 was 18.7% and 16.6%

The mean changes from baseline in CRT using OC are graphically displayed in Figure 5; the corresponding LS 
mean changes from baseline in CRT using MMRM in the FAS are displayed in Figure 6.  
Although  reductions  from  baseline  in  CRT  were  consistently  observed  at  all  timepoints,  some  fluctuation  in 
mean CRT was seen by the MAH in all treatment groups with attenuation in magnitude over the course of 60 
weeks.  The  small  fluctuations  that  are  observed  in  all  treatment  groups  over  time  are  not  considered  to  be 
clinically relevant by the MAH given the demonstration of the non-inferiority in visual acuity.

Overall, the LS mean change from baseline in NEI-VFQ-25 total score at week 48 was 4.06 and 2.94 in the 
HDq12, and HDq16 groups, respectively, compared with 2.82 in the 2q8 group (Table 31).

Summaries of NEI-VFQ-25 total scores by visit through week 60 are provided in Table 14.2.3.6.3a for the OC, 
and in Table 14.2.3.6.4a for the LOCF of the r-14238 report section. 
Globally, results tend to differ in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups and are supported by the sensitivity analysis. 
Furthermore, some secondary endpoints results tend to stand out more than others in the HD groups rather 
than  in  2q8  treatment  group.  Therefore  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  and  the 
interpretation of those results with regards to the HD regimen (HDq12 and HDq16) proposed.  
Based on the provided responses, the Applicant concluded that all treatment arms achieved similar functional 
benefits. Differences in structural endpoints were mostly associated with injection timing and did not 
translate into clinically meaningful differences in quality of life or visual acuity. 
The  eligibility  criteria  of  the  PHOTON  study  aimed  to  include  an  informative  population  in  terms  of  DME

with a non-inferiority margin of 15% which was met by the HDq12 arm (adjusted difference 1.98%, 95% CI -

Like for Week 48 and Week 60, across all treatment groups, more patients gained letters in BCVA at Week 96, 
compared to those losing letters in BCVA.  A similar proportion of patients in the HDq12 and 2q8 groups gained 
≥ 5, ≥ 10 or ≥ 15 letters through Week 96 compared to slightly lower proportions reported for the HDq16 group. 
Indeed, the HDq16 group failed to reach values > 20% for patients who gained ≥ 15 letters through Week 96. 
The  proportions  of  patients  gaining  ≥  15  letters  was  24.5%  and  19.6%  at  Week  96.  More  globally,  the 
proportions  of  patients  who  gained  ≥  15  letters  in  BCVA  from  baseline  increased  fastest  in  the  2q8  group, 
followed by HDq12 and HDq16 
Additional exploratory efficacy results for PHOTON study at Week 96 
Change from baseline in CST 
The arithmetic mean decreases from baseline in CST over time were similar in both HD treatment groups with 
minor numerical differences over time. At Week 96, the mean changes from baseline CST (µm) were -194.8 
and -157.2 for HDq12 and HDq16, respectively. This is consistent with the results reported for the2q8 group 
at Week 96. 
For the subset of patients who completed two q20 intervals and had q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval,  main  CST  (µm)  decreases  over  time  were  consistent  with  the  results  seen  in  HDq16  patients  who 
completed at least one q20 interval.

Overall,  the  provided  additional  long-term  data  are  globally  reassuring  both  on  a  quantitative  (number  of 
exposed patients) and qualitative aspects (results on efficacy endpoints). Indeed, based on data from PULSAR 
(approx. 80% completed Week 96 data collection) and on the data from all patients in PHOTON, HD aflibercept 
dosed every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks showed nearly similar maintained efficacy through Week 96 compared 
to 2 mg aflibercept, consistent with the non-inferiority demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to 
improvement in BCVA in patients with nAMD or DME.

Overall,  the  exploratory  results  stand  out  more  in  the  2q8  treatment  group  compared  to  the  HD  groups. 
Moreover, identically to PULSAR study, in addition to the shortening of the intervals of IVT injections, some 
patients were eligible starting week 52 to extend up by 4 week the interval based on DRM criteria assessed in 
HD  groups  and  at  60  weeks  (patients  in  HDq12  group  could  be  injected  with  a  q16  interval  and  patients  in 
HDq16 group could be injected with a q20 interval). 
Common MO was raised with the PULSAR study regarding the wording in the section 4.2 in the SmPC and an 
OC regarding the clarity of the table presenting the different dosing intervals adopted during the studies by the 
patients. 
In addition to the clarification discussed above and related to the provided new additional data regarding the 
claimed 5 month/20q interval, the following information have been provided.

As a remainder, all participants in HD groups were eligible for dose interval shortening (to a minimum of q8) 
as of Week 16 or extension (by 4-week increments) as of Week 52 according to the pre-specified DRM criteria. 
Due to this option for treatment individualization, by the end of Year 2, the HDq12 and HDq16 groups were 
allocated  into  a  range  of  treatment  intervals  from  8  to  24  weeks.  No  patient  had  yet  completed  a  24-week 
interval by Week 96, but patients could have completed one or two q20 intervals. As for the requested 2-year 
data,  the  Applicant  provided  exposure  details  for  patients  who  extended  their  treatment  interval  to  q20  or 
longer. Through Week 96, up to 47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or 
longer intervals in the PULSAR and PHOTON study respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 
patients completed at least one q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24

Design and conduct of clinical study 
A supportive study named CANDELA (21086, VGFTe (HD)-AMD-1905; completed) was planned in the MAH’s 
clinical development program. CANDELA study was a multi-center (US sites only), randomized, single-masked, 
active-controlled Phase 2 study in participants with nAMD that investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of HD (high-dose aflibcercept 8 mg) versus IAI (aflibcercept 2 mg).  
A total of approximately 100 eligible participants were planned to be randomized into 2 groups (IAI and HD) in 
a 1:1 ratio and within each treatment group, 15 participants (total of 30) were also included in the dense PK 
substudy. The study duration (44 weeks) is considered long enough to investigate the efficacy and safety profile 
of the product. 
Three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections (baseline, week 4, and week 8), followed by additional doses 
at  weeks  20  and  32  in  both  groups.  At  week  16,  additional  treatment  (“rescue”)  could  be  given  after 
consultation with the Sponsor, if in the investigator’s judgement, a patient could not adhere to the protocol-
specified dosing interval due to persistent or worsening disease and required an interim injection. Moreover, at 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 156/235 
 
 
weeks 24, 28, 36, and 40, participants were evaluated and given a dose (at their randomized dose level) if 
EITHER of the following criteria were met (pro re nata [PRN] criteria): 
- Loss of ≥ 5 letters from week 20 Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) due to disease progression OR 
- Anatomical findings that were considered vision-threatening, such as worsening or persistent retinal fluid, 
new or worsening retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED), new or persistent hemorrhage, etc  
Figure 3.6.1 – Dosing schedule 
CANDELA study enrolled men or women ≥ 50 years of age subjects with active subfoveal CNV secondary to 
nAMD,  including  juxtafoveal  lesions  that  affect  the  fovea  in  the  study  eye  as  assessed  by  an  independent 
reading center, and BCVA at 4 m from 78 to 24 letters (ETDRS chart) equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of of 
20/32 to 20/320 in the study eye. Subject’s selection are considered and similar to the PULSAR study.  
The primary efficacy endpoint aimed to determine if HD provides greater intraocular PD effect and/or longer 
duration of action compared with 2 mg IAI by assessing the proportion of participants without retinal fluid in 
the center subfield at week 16. 
No secondary endpoints were planned. Exploratory efficacy endpoints aim generate additional data to 
determine the effect of HD vs IAI on anatomical measures of response and on visual acuity. 
It is to note that the study enrolment was paused for approximately 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic 
and did not have any significant impact on the conduct of the study or the study participants who were already 
enrolled as only one participant discontinue the study.  
In total, 106 participants were randomized: 53 to the IAI group and 53 to the HD group and 92.5% and 96.2% 
completed the study in IAI and HD groups respectively. 
Overall,  demographics,  baseline  disease  characteristics  and  medical  history  were  generally  well  balanced 
between the treatment groups, with the exception of sex (there was a higher proportion of male participants 
in the HD group compared with the IAI group).

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall,  all  efficacy  endpoints  were  analyzed  using  the  FAS  and  additional  OC,  aLOCF,  and  aOC  sensitivity 
analyses were performed. All exploratory efficacy endpoints were analyzed descriptively, with nominal p-values.  
Through week 44, the mean (SD) duration of treatment in the study eye was 36.9 (7.77) weeks in the IAI 
group and 37.7 (4.52) weeks in the HD group with a majority of 5 IVT injections in both groups.  
The primary endpoint related to efficacy was the proportion of participants without fluid in the center subfield 
of the study eye at Week 16 with an exploratory endpoint at week 44 (Table 3.6.1.). The decreasing tendency 
in the proportion of patients without fluid at week 16 (50.9% in HD group and 34% in IAI group) was further 
observed at week 44 (39.6% in HD group and 28.3% in IAI group) in both groups with a numerically superiority 
in the HD groups (without statistical differences). 
Table 3.6.1 - Proportion of Participants without Fluid in the Center Subfield of the Study Eye, LOCF 
at Week 16 and Week 44 (Full Analysis Set) 
Additional precision on IRF/SRF fluid were indicated by the MAH: 
- 
The proportion of participants without IRF in the center subfield of study eye which were numerically 
similar  at  week  16  (HD:  69.8%;  IAI:  67.9%;  treatment  difference:  1.9%;  95%  CI:  -15.7, 
19.5;p=0.8339) and at week 44 (HD: 60.4%; IAI:  64.2%; treatment difference: -3.8%;  95% CI: -
22.2, 14.7; p=0.6886) in both groups 
- 
The  proportion  of  participants  without  SRF  in  the  center  subfield  of  study  eye  at  week  16  was 
numerically  higher  in  the  HD  group  (69.8%)  compared  with  the  IAI  group  (50.9%;  treatment 
difference: 18.9%; 95% CI: 0.6, 37.1; p=0.0471) and at week 44 (HD: 69.8%; IAI: 50.9%)

Other endpoints were also analysis by the MAH, including: 
- 
The  proportion  of  participants  without  macular  fluid  in  the  study  eye  at  week  16  (HD:  43.4%;  IAI: 
26.4%; treatment difference: 17.0%; 95% CI: -0.9, 34.8; p=0.0667) and at week 44 (HD: 32.1%; 
IAI: 15.1%; treatment difference: 17.0%; 95% CI: 1.1, 32.8; p=0.0395). With the precision in the: 
o  proportion of participants without intraretinal macular fluid in the study eye at week 16 (HD: 
58.5%; IAI: 58.5%; treatment difference: 0.0%; 95% CI: -18.8, 18.8; p=1.0000) and at week 
44 (HD: 47.2%; IAI: 45.3%; treatment difference: 1.9%; 95% CI: -17.1, 20.9; p=0.8455)  
o  proportion of participants  without subretinal macular fluid in the study eye at week 16 (HD: 
67.9%; IAI: 43.4%; treatment difference: 24.5%; 95% CI: 6.2, 42.9; p=0.0110) and at week 
44  (HD:  66.0%;  IAI:  43.4%;  treatment  difference:  22.6%;  95%  CI:  4.2,  41.1;  p=0.0192). 
The treatment difference between the 2 groups was nominally statistically significant at both 
time points. 
- 
The proportion of participants able to maintain a 12-week dosing interval from week 8 through week 
44 (ie, participants receiving only protocol required treatments) was numerically higher in the HD group 
(54.7%) compared with the IAI group (45.3%). Of those participants completing the week 16 visit, a 
numerically higher proportion of participants in the HD group (81.1%) compared with the IAI group 
(72.9%) did not require an additional dose of treatment at week 16. Of those participants completing 
the week 44 visit, a numerically higher proportion of participants in the HD group (56.9%) compared 
with the IAI group (49.0%) did not require an additional dose of treatment at week 16 or PRN doses 
at weeks 24, 28, 36, or 40 
- 
The  proportion  of  participants  receiving  only  protocol  required  treatments  and  completing  Week  44, 
with and without fluid in the center subfield of the study eye (aLOCF) were similar between HD and IAI 
groups at weeks 16, 24, 28, 36, and 40. 
Additional endpoints as the proportion of participants able to maintain no retinal fluid in the center subfield of 
study eye through week 16 and week 44, the time to maintaining no retinal fluid in the center subfield of study 
eye through week 44 and proportion of participants without subretinal pigment epithelium fluid in the macula 
of study eye, were considered numerically higher in the HD group. 
Regarding the change observed from baseline in BCVA score (ETDRS Score) in the study eye, the mean (SE) 
change from baseline in BCVA was numerically higher in the HD group compared with the IAI group both at 
week 16 (HD: 8.4 [1.31] ETDRS letters; IAI: 6.5 [1.38] ETDRS letters) and week 44 (HD: 7.9 [1.47] ETDRS 
letters; IAI: 5.1 [1.52] ETDRS letters). Also, the least squares (LS) mean (standard error [SE]) change in BCVA 
from baseline was numerically higher in the HD group compared with the IAI group at week 16 and 44 (Table 
3.6.2.).

Moreover, the proportion of participants with no vision change or any loss, or who lost ≥ 5, 10, and 15 ETDRS 
Letters  from  Baseline  in  Study  Eye  were  numerically  higher  in  the  IAI  group  (Table  3.6.3).  However,  the 
proportion  of  participants  who  gained  ≥  1,  5,  10,  and  15  ETDRS  Letters  from  Baseline  in  Study  Eye  were 
numerically higher in the HD group (except for ≥5 letter gain) see Table 3.6.4.

Additionally, the change from baseline in CRT, total lesion size and Choroidal Neovascularization Size in the 
Study Eye were numerically favour of the HD group compared with the IAI group both at week 16 and at week 
44. 
Overall, the superiority of the HD treatment compared to the IAI group was no met for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. However, the efficacy results were numerically in favour of the HD group and were further confirmed 
by the sensitivity analysis performed by the MAH. Moreover, the efficacy results CANDELA study support the 
initiation dosing regimen in the nAMD patients.  
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design of main studies 
This variation include clinical efficacy data of 2 pivotal studies in patients with nAMD (ongoing phase 3 PULSAR, 
submitted data at 48 and 60 week) and DME (ongoing phase 2/3 PHOTON, submitted data at 48 and 60 week) 
as well as one supportive  study in nAMD patients (CANDELA, completed) for  the new high-dose strength of 
aflibercept 8 mg (114.3 mg/mL). Both pivotal studies were multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-
controlled and composed of 3 arms (2q8, HDq12 and HDq16) and were randomized to receive IVT injections 
in the study eye of either aflibercept high-dosed (HD) or aflibercept 2 mg in 3 parallel treatment groups. Patient 
were treated with 3 (in PULSAR) or 5 (in PHOTON) initial IVT injections at 4-week intervals, followed by IVT 
injection every 8 weeks in the 2q8 group (comparator), or with 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals, followed 
by IVT injection 12 or 16 weeks in HDq12 and HDq16 groups respectively, with possible interval modification 
starting week 16.  
A  CHMP  scientific  advice  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/277944/2019)  included  discussion  about  both  pivotal  studies  in 
term of comparator choice, overall design of the study (non-inferiority, double-masked, randomised, active-
controlled, three-arm), endpoints.  
Approximately, 1395 patients had been enrolled in PULSAR (1:1:1 ratio, with 337 patients in 2q8 arm, 336 in 
HDq12 and 338 in HDq16 arm respectively) and 660 in PHOTON (1:2:1 ratio, with 167 patients in 2q8 arm, 
329 in HDq12 and 164 in HDq16). The patients included were adequately selected with regard to the disease. 
Furthermore, patients were stratified on the geographical region (Japan vs Rest of the World) and the BCVA 
baseline (<60 vs ≥60) in PULSAR or CRT baseline (<400µm vs ≥400 µm) and prior DME treatment (yes/no) 
in PHOTON. As in PULSAR trial, the granularity of the geographical stratification could seem a bit wide. The 
country level could have been an option but no per country patient disposition was found in the trial’s CSR to 
document  this  point.  This  per  country  disposition  are  of  great  importance  (see  comments  below)  and  the 
Applicant was requested to provide them with the following 2 regions disposition: Europe, including Czech Rep, 
Germany, Hungary and UK, North America including Canada and USA, Japan is already described in the file. 
The requested information for the Pulsar trial was provided. The EU population constituted the largest cohort 
of subjects included in the trial (39%), followed mainly by cohorts from North America (30%) and Asia (23%), 
representing a total of 92% of the study population. Based on these results, homogeneous treatment responses 
in these 3 major subgroups should be expected.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 162/235 
 
 
 
 
Additionally,  the  efficacy  populations  of  analysis  in  PULSAR  study  are  acceptable,  except  for  PPS  which  was 
planned to  be analysed “as treated” while an error of treatment allocation  should be considered as  a major 
deviation  to  the  protocol.  Moreover,  if  the  wrong  treatment  allocation  occurred  only  at  some  specific  time-
points of the 48/60 weeks of exposure (this case is defined as an ICE), the rational for deciding which arm to 
assign to patient in the “as treated” strategy is unclear and should be explained. As a response, clarifications 
have been brought by the Applicant regarding the “as treated” terminology used in the trial. Only 6 patients 
were concerned with the qualification of "as treated", whom only one subject underwent an error of treatment 
allocation. The other subjects were affected by deviations in the amount of volume injected or in the modalities 
of administration. The issue could be considered as solved though the PP set do not reflect per-se the definition 
of such a population where patients presenting deviations in planned regimens potentially affecting the primary 
efficacy endpoint should be excluded. 
Results of main studies 
PULSAR - nAMD 
1395  enrolled  participants  in  PULSAR  study  but  383  participants  did  not  complete  screening,  therefore,  the 
Week  48  and  Week  60  datasets  analysis  provided  are  based  on  1011  participants.  For  these  participants, 
proportion of male and female were well balanced between the 3 arms, even if slightly more female patients 
were  included  in  total  (54,5%).  Data  were  mostly  well  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups  for  the 
demographics and disease characteristics at baseline (BCVA, IOP, CST, CNV size, type and classification, total 
lesion  area  and  NEI-VFQ-25  total  score).  The  ocular  medical  and  surgical  history  in  the  study  eye  mostly 
reported (> 10%) were AMD, Cataract and Cataract operation and the non-ocular medical and surgical history 
in the study eye, most commonly reported SOC (> 30%) were Vascular disorders, Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders, Surgical and medical procedures, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. However, the 
MAH was requested to further discuss the clinical relevance of baseline disease characteristics of the following 
observed discrepancies in PULSAR study (in patients of certain categories of age (<65, ≥ 65 to < 75 and ≥ 75 
to  <  80  years),  with  history  of  ischaemic  heart  disease  and  hepatic  impairment  (mild,  severe,  moderate), 
cataract, CST). The Applicant provides further discussion on clinical relevance of baseline disease characteristics 
of the observed discrepancies in PULSAR study. According to the Applicant, the differences are to be considered 
as minor numerical differences at baseline without clinical significance relevance.  
Moreover, among those participants, it is to note that COVID-19 crisis and Ukraine/Russia conflict had a low 
impact on the discontinuation of the participants, however considering that 35.1% of patients across the groups 
in PULSAR study reported important protocol deviations, The MAH was requested to further discuss the impact 
of each protocol deviation of them on the efficacy analysis. As a response, the Applicant has clarified what was 
meant  by  "important"  protocol  deviations  in  Pulsar  study  and  described  extensively  the  corresponding 
deviations as well as the decision rules that led to rule out from the primary analysis or the PPS analysis, all or 
part of data of patients presenting these deviations, depending on the way the might affect efficacy outcome 
and when they occurred. “Important” deviations to protocol were segmented in 3 categories: 1/ the ones not 
impacting the efficacy endpoints led to no exclusion from main efficacy analyses; 2/ deviations that might affect 
the efficacy endpoints and identified at screening led to excluding affected patients from the per-protocol set; 
3/ deviations that might impact the efficacy and occurring after baselines measurements led to excluding from 
the  main  efficacy  analyses  partial  data  of  affected  patients.  These  last  deviations  were  considered  as 
intercurrent events and handled according to estimand strategies (mainly, hypothetical and treatment policy 
strategies,  depending  of  the  strength  of  the  impact  on  efficacy  data).    Tables  illustrating  and  justifying  the 
updated definition and all concerned cases were provided and even though other approaches could have been 
considered, the proposed approach is reasonable. 
Assessment report

However, in non-inferiority trials, it is well known that heterogeneity of data is a factor artificially favoring the 
non-inferiority, therefore, it would have been relevant to perform a per-protocol analysis excluding all patients 
presenting with "important" deviations impacting the primary endpoint within the 48 weeks treatment window, 
whatever the reason and the time of occurrence. This analysis, repeated on EU population would have been 
interesting too. 
Additionally, to be noticed that there were 47 cases of wrong treatment allocation. It was requested to briefly 
describe these cases in a table presenting the randomized and actual allocated treatment, the time point(s) 
concerned  and  the  “as-treated”  arm  assigned  in  the  PPS  analysis.  Thus,  all  the  data  requested  have  been 
provided and it is confirmed that except for one patient, all patients had their treatment allocated according to 
the randomization. However, it is still questionable to keep in the PPS, patients having received the wrong dose 
(as described by the Applicant). 
For the analysis of the primary endpoint, a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) was used with 
baseline BCVA measurement as a covariate and treatment group, visit, the stratification variables (geographic 
region [Japan vs. Rest of World], and baseline BCVA [< 60 vs. ≥ 60]) as fixed factors as well as terms for the 
interaction between baseline BCVA and visit and for the interaction between treatment and visit. 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA (ETDRS letter score) at Week 48, completed with 
a key secondary endpoint of that measure at week 60. The mean BCVA at baseline was 58.9, 59.9 and 60.0 
letters for 2q8 (n=336 patients), HDq12 (n=335 patients) and HDq16 (n=338 patients) groups respectively. 
The LS mean (SE) change of BCVA from baseline to week 48 observed were: 7.03 (0.74), 6.06 (0.77) and 5.89 
(0.72)  letters  in  2q8  (n=285  patients),  HDq12  (n=299  patients)  and  HDq16  (n=289  patients)  groups 
respectively with an estimated difference in LS means from baseline to Week 48 in BCVA (with corresponding 
95% CI) changes and the p-values for the non-inferiority test at a margin of 4 letters of HDq12 vs. 2q8 -0.97 
(-2.87, 0.92; p-value 0.0009) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 was -1.14 (-2.97, 0.69; p-value 0.0011) letters. 
At week 60, 7.23 (0.68), 6.37 (0.74) and 6.31 (0.66) letters in 2q8 (n=268 patients), HDq12 (n=283 patients) 
and  HDq16  (n=282  patients)  groups  were  observed  for  the  LS  mean  (SE),  respectively  and  the  estimated 
difference of HDq12 vs. 2q8 was -0.86 (-2.57, 0.84; p-value 0.0002) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 was -0.92 
(-2.51, 0.66; p-value < 0.0001) letters. 
The MAH also performed subgroup analysis in change from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter 
score at Week 48 and Week 60 and the results presented were similar with the overall population. Tendency 
for higher mean increases in the HD groups compared to the 2q8 group were noted for the Asian and Japanese 
subgroups. However, given the smaller size of these subgroups, the validity of these comparisons is limited. 
Additionally, two sensitivity analyses were performed regarding the change from baseline in BCVA measured 
by the ETDRS letter score at Week 48 and 60, using ANCOVA method. The results were consistent with the 
primary analysis. 
Overall, the primary and key secondary endpoint criteria, to know, the change from baseline in BCVA measured 
by  the  ETDRS  letter  score  at  Week  48  and  60  (non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  HDq12  and  HDq16 
dosing  regimen  to  the  current  authorized  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  2q8  dosing  regimen)  is  considered  to  be 
statistically met (95% credible interval for treatment difference with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with 
LS mean change from baseline in BCVA to Week 48 and 60), at Week 48 and 60. However, even if the non-
inferiority appear to be statistically met, given the longer intervals in the new proposed dosing regimen (HDq12 
and HDq16), more long-term efficacy and safety results are awaited for both PHOTON and PULSAR studies. 
Therefore, and as discussed in the previous scientific advice dated from 2019, in order to straighten the efficacy 
Assessment report

and safety results, the Applicant was requested to provide the 2 years data. All the data requested have been 
provided. 
Consequently,  to  respond  to  the  requested  2-year  data,  a  snapshot  of  PULSAR  data  up  to  Week  96  was 
performed in May 2023. This dataset comprises all patients (100%) enrolled in PULSAR. Of ongoing patients, 
approximately 80% (689 out of 875) had already completed the Week 96 visit and almost all had completed 
visits up to Week 88. More precisely, of the 1009 randomized patients included in the FAS and the SAF, 689 
patients  had  completed  the  study  through  Week  96.  137  patients  had  discontinued  prematurely.  For  186 
patients (18.4%), according to the Applicant, these patients constitute the ongoing patients at the time of the 
data snapshot 
The mean number of active injections in the Week 96 completers of the PULSAR SAF population was 12.8, 9.8 
and 8.2 in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups, respectively, over the first 96 weeks of the study. 
Of note, the proportions of Week 96 completers in the European subgroups were even higher than in the non-
European subgroups given that the recruitment in Europe was completed earlier than in other regions 
For the PHOTON study, this later reached Week 96 LPLV in May 2023.  Therefore, complete Week 96 key results 
for the DME indication are available in full for all study participants. Of the 660 randomized patients included 
in the FAS and the SAF, 534 patients completed the study through Week 96. However, 126 patients did not 
complete the study, with a higher proportion of patients in the HDq12 group (22.2% vs. 15.2% and 16.8%), 
mainly attributable to withdrawal of consent by subject, lost to follow-up and death. Of note, 31 (4.7%) patients 
were reported as lost to follow-up through Week 96. As for PULSAR study, the mean number of active injections 
in  the  PHOTON  SAF  population  of  Week-96  completers  was  proportional  to  allocated  interval  dosing  with  a 
number of injection of 13.8, 9.5 and 7.8 in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups, respectively over 
the first 96 weeks of the study 
Overall,  the  provided  additional  long-term  data  are  globally  reassuring  both  on  a  quantitative  (number  of 
exposed patients) and qualitative aspects (results on efficacy endpoints). Indeed, based on data from PULSAR 
(approx. 80% completed Week 96 data collection) and on the data from all patients in PHOTON, HD aflibercept 
dosed every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks showed nearly similar maintained efficacy through Week 96 compared 
to 2 mg aflibercept, consistent with the non-inferiority demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to 
improvement in BCVA in patients with nAMD or DME. 
The MAH was requested to further discuss clinical relevance of the chosen 4 letters margin rather than a smaller 
one as advised in the previous scientific advice in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies. The justification of the 
non-inferiority  margin  provided  by  the  Applicant  has  been  consistent  and  clinically  relevant.  This  margin 
ensures that any difference in visual acuity within one line of the ETDRS chart is not clinically meaningful. This 
4-letters margin has been used in many non-inferiority trials investigating visual acuity.  
Moreover,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  and  justify  the  initiation  dosing  regimen  of  3  monthly  IVT 
injections that appears to be 4 times higher exposure than the current regimen authorized and provide efficacy 
and safety results regarding that period for both PULSAR and PHOTON studies. Furthermore, for PHOTON study, 
the MAH was also requested to discuss the difference in term of number of injections in HD group during that 
period compared to the current authorized dosing regimen. It appears that during the loading phase  (up to 
Week 12), in PULSAR (3 monthly injections in all study arms) and PHOTON studies (5 monthly injections for 
2q8 and 3 monthly injections for all HD) all treatment arms received active monthly injection with either 2 mg 
or 8 mg aflibercept at day 1, week 4 and week 8.

In PULSAR, comparable proportions of ocular TEAE were reported (17,3% for 2q8 vs 18,1% for all HD) and 
proportions of TEAE reported in more than 2 patients and with a difference ≥ 0.5% to the 2 mg arm (retinal 
haemorrhage,  conjunctivitis,  IOP  increase  and  vitreous  floaters)  were  low  and  comparable.  Additionally, 
comparable  proportions  were  reported  for  ocular  safety  topics  (cataract,  retinal  detachment/tear,  RPE  tear, 
and  intraocular  inflammation)  other  than  IOP  increase  for  which  event  were  all  non-serious  and  without 
sustained IOP elevations. Non-ocular TEAE were reported in higher proportions for HD group (22.1% vs 16.7% 
in  2q8  arm).  For  SOC  in  which  a  difference  of  >  1%  was  observed  and  higher  incidence  in  the  HD  arms 
(Infections and infestations and Vascular disorders), PT reported in more than 1 patient were Pulpitis dental, 
Upper respiratory and Urinary tract infection and Hypertension. Incidence for non-ocular safety topics were low 
and comparable between treatment arms.  
In  PHOTON,  incidences  of  ocular  TEAEs  were  higher  in  the  HD  group  (2q8:  9.6%,  all  HD:  17.1%)  however 
when compared to PULSAR studies a lower proportion of ocular TEAE was reported in 2q8 arm (PULSAR - 2q8: 
17.3%, PHOTON – 2q8: 9.6%) and incidences for ocular TEAE in the HD group were nevertheless similar to 
PULSAR. Events reported in more than 2 patients and with a difference ≥ 0.5% to the 2 mg arm consisted of 
cataract/cataract cortical, conjunctival hemorrhage, photopsia, punctate keratitis, and vitreous detachment for 
which  no  consistent  trend  were  observed  across  studies.  Proportions  of  ocular  safety  topics  were  low  and 
comparable  between  treatment  arms.  Non-ocular  event  were  reported  in  comparable  proportions  between 
treatment arms. For the SOC with a difference of > 1% and higher incidence in the HD arms (Gastrointestinal 
disorders,  Infections  and  infestations,  Nervous  system  disorders,  Psychiatric  disorders,  Renal  and  urinary 
disorders and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders), majority of PTs were reported in single patient 
with no consistent trend were observed across studies. Incidences for non-ocular safety topics were low and 
comparable.  
Overall, although exposures to aflibercept in the HD treatment arms in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies were 
higher during the loading phase and that the incidence of ocular TEAE in the 2q8 arms in both groups were 
disparate,  safety  data  are  still  reassuring  and  in  favour  of  a  comparable  safety  profile  with  ocular  and  non-
ocular TEAE being reported in similar range between both studies. No consistent trend could be observed in 
both studies. 
The second key secondary endpoint concerned the proportion of participants with no intraretinal fluid (IRF) and 
no  subretinal  fluid  (SRF)  in  Central  Subfield  at  Week  16  with  a  comparison  between  the  2q8  group  versus 
pooled HD groups (HDq12 and HDq16). At week 16, 51.6% in the 2q8 treatment group compared to 63.3% of 
participants in the pooled HD groups (61.6% in HDq12 and 65% in HDq16arm) had no retinal fluid (no IRF and 
no SRF) with a difference (95% CI) between pooled HD groups vs. 2q8 treatment of 11.733% points (5.263%, 
18.204%)  superiority  and  a  p-value  of  the  1-sided  CMH  test  for  superiority  of  0.0002.  The  key  secondary 
endpoint appears to be statistically met for both HD groups at week 16. More long-term data were provided 
for this endpoint (week 48 and 60) and same tendency was observed with an absence of IRF and SRF more 
pronounce in the HD groups and more particularly in the HDq12 group.  
Subgroups  regarding  the  proportions  of  participants  with  no  IRF  and  no  SRF  in  central  subfield  at  Week  16 
were analysed by subgroups of age, sex, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline BCVA, and baseline PCV 
and discrepancies are noted in the following subgroups of patients: < 65 years, ≥ 65 to < 75 years, ≥ 80 to < 
85 years, females, from Rest of the world, not Hispanic or Latino, White, with a baseline BCVA ≤ 73 letters, 
and no PCV at baseline.

A sensitivity analyses was performed regarding the presence/absence of IRF/SRF in Central Subfield at Week 
16 using LOCF in FAS and the results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Additionally, other secondary endpoints were analysed at week 48 and 60, such as: proportions of participants 
gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA, proportion of participants achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 
(approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent), mean change in CNV size, mean change in total lesion area, mean 
change in CST and the mean change in NEI-VQF-25 total score. Overall, secondary efficacy endpoints results 
for HD groups (HDq12 and HDq16) in PULSAR study appears to be following the same tendency as for the 2q8 
group with a slight numerical superiority in favour to the HDq12 regimen compared to the HDq16. Therefore, 
the MAH was invited to further discuss the clinical relevance of the secondary endpoint results with regards to 
the  two  new  proposed  dosing  regimen.  As  requested,  the  applicant  provides  a  comprehensive  discussion 
regarding the clinical relevance of the Secondary efficacy endpoints results for HD groups (HDq12 and HDq16) 
in PULSAR study (functional and anatomical response based on Change from baseline in BCVA measured by 
the ETDRS letter, Proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in central subfield, Proportion of participants 
gaining ≥ 15 letters in BCVA, Change from baseline in CST...).  
Overall,  the  functional  measures  show  similar  outcomes  across  the  3  treatment  groups,  with  non-inferiority 
demonstrated  in  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  60,  in  line  with  the 
primary endpoint results at Week 48. Between the two HD groups, numerical differences in other secondary 
endpoints are small, and not always in favour of HDq12 (e.g. proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters 
in BCVA from baseline to Week 48). In conclusion, the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints in PULSAR 
are in line with the primary analysis and seem clinically relevant for demonstrating the value of aflibercept for 
the treatment of nAMD. 
To note, results of exploratory endpoints were similar between groups, except for the presented proportion of 
patients with different dosing intervals that appear to be unclear for which the MAH was asked to provide a 
Table clearly identifying the patient’s dosing interval of treatment in each arms at Week 48 and 60 (q8, q12, 
q16 and q20). As requested, the Applicant provides details identifying the patient’s dosing interval of treatment 
in each arms at Week 48 and 60 (q8, q12, q16 and q20) in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies 
For PULSAR study, it appears that the majority of patients were rather maintained on their originally assigned 
interval or extended to a greater interval (eg, from q12 to q16 interval) both on W48 and W60 completers. 
However,  even  low,  it  should  be  noted  that  a  certain  proportion  of  patients  were  shortened  their  treatment 
interval (less than 20% in both HDq12 and HDq16 arm at W48 and W60). In the meantime, and as discussed 
Assessment report

above,  a  proportion  of  patients  were  extended  from  their  original  assignment  (43.1%  of  HDq12  arm  were 
extended to a q16 dosing interval and 38.2% of HDq16 arm were extended to a q20 dosing interval)  
For PHOTON study, the proportion of patients who maintained their original interval was greater with around 
90% of patients maintained their originally assigned q12 or q16 dosing at W48 and W60 and around 10% who 
shortened the originally assigned interval. In parallel, 43.3% and 36.2% of patients were extended to a q16 
and q20 dosing interval for HDq12 and HDq16 arm respectively. 
This exploratory endpoint appears critical in order to better assess the HD groups given the posology proposed 
is also based on the following results: 
- No dose modification permitted in 2Q8, (85.7% of participant received 7 IVT injections at week 48 and 77.4% 
received 9 IVT injections at Week 60). 
- In the HDq12 group: at week 48 with a total of 316 patient, 79.4% of patients stayed with the HDq12 dosing 
regimen and 20.6% shortened to q8; at week 60 with a total of 311 patients, 77.8% of patients stayed with 
the HDq12 dosing regimen and 22.2% shortened to q8. In total, 77.6% of participant received 6 IVT injections 
at week 48 and 71.3% received 7 IVT injections at Week 60. 
- In the HDq16 group: at week 48 with a total of 312 patient, 76.6% of patients stayed with the HDq16 dosing 
regimen and 23.4% shortened (12.8% to q8 and 10.6% to HDq12 regimen); at week 60 with a total of 309 
patients, 86.9% of patients stayed with the HDq16 dosing regimen and 23.4% shortened (14.6% to q8 and 
11.3%  to  HDq12  regimen).  In  total,  77.8%  of  participant  received  5  IVT  injections  at  week  48  and  75.4% 
received 6 IVT injections at Week 60. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  issued  from  PULSAR  study  are  very  limited  to  support  the  5  months  injection 
interval during the maintenance phase. More long-term results are awaited by the sponsor. As a response, the 
applicant provides additional new data that could support the claimed q20 (or longer) intervals. Through Week 
96, up to 47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or longer intervals in the 
PULSAR and PHOTON study respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 patients completed at 
least one q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24. 
In addition, further discussion was requested to be carried by the MAH on the absence of visits between two 
injections during the maintenance phase. In response, the Applicant provides some clarifications regarding the 
relevance of absence of visits between two injections during the maintenance phase for patients allocated to 
HD intervals. 
As  discussed  in  the  MO  above,  considering  that  the  HDq12  and  HDq16  treatment  regimens  have  overall 
demonstrated BCVA gains non-inferior compared to 2q8, it is supported that modification of treatment intervals 
is  not  needed  between  doses  and  therefore  monitoring  visits  are  not  a  requirement  for  these  regimens. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 168/235 
 
 
Nevertheless, in line with the current practice regarding aflibercept 2 mg and the information included in the 
SmPC for aflibercept 2 mg, the Applicant proposes that event for the HD intervals, the frequency of monitoring 
visits  may  be  higher  than  the  dosing  frequency,  based  on  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician.  As  for 
validated  regimen,  the  applicant  proposal  to  leave  need  for  monitoring  visits  to  the  physician´s  discretion 
seems to be acceptable.  
PHOTON – DME 
Data were mostly balanced across the treatment groups for the demographics and disease characteristics at 
baseline  for  the  following  assessed  criteria:  BCVA,  IOP,  CRT,  prior  DME  treatment.  The  ocular  medical  and 
surgical  history  in  the  study  eye  mostly  reported  (>  10%)  were  AMD,  Cataract,  cataract  nuclear,  cataract 
operation and retinal laser coagulation. Given that a lot of baseline characteristics appears to be unbalanced 
between  the  3  groups,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  further  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  following 
discrepancies in PHOTON study : patients of different age category (<55, ≥ 55 to < 65), ethnicity (Black or 
African American, White), percentage of Hemoglobin A1c at baseline category (≤8% and ≥ 8%), patients with 
history  of  cerebrovascular  disease,  history  of  ischaemic  heart  disease  and  diabetes  type  II  (Non/insulin 
dependent),  BCVA  category  (≤73  and  ≥  73  letters)  CRT,  DRSS,  cataract  history,  vitreous  detachment, 
intraocular lens implant, metabolism and nutrition disorders (Hyperlipidaemia, Hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes 
mellitus),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (gastroesophageal  reflux  disease),  immune  system  disorders  (seasonal 
allergy and drug hypersensitivity) and endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism). Based on the Applicant responses, 
regarding the age, in the age group < 55 there were 17.4%, 23.5% and 23.3% subjects and in the ≥ 55 to < 
65 group there were 37.7%, 32.9% and 33.1% subjects in the 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 group respectively. 
Based on the mean and median age including the standard deviation, the Applicant concluded that there was 
a similar distribution of age for the treatment groups and thus the minor numerical differences at baseline with 
regards to age groups are not considered clinically relevant. Due to the lower sample size per subgroup these 
did  show  some  minor  variability  but  did  not  reveal  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  subgroup 
populations and the total population. 
For the ethnicity and Hemoglobin A1c differences, the observed imbalance among these subgroups is due to 
their  relatively  small  sample  sizes  and  is  therefore  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Indeed,  the  Applicant 
considers  that  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are  calculated  based  on  the  entire  population  (and  not 
subgroups), such differences are judged as not clinically relevant. 
Regarding the Medical history, the numerical imbalance in the distribution is also explained by the small number 
of patients and are not considered clinically relevant. 
The primary endpoint analysis assessed the change from baseline in BCVA (ETDRS letter score) at Week 48, 
completed with a key secondary endpoint of that measure at week 60. The mean BCVA (SD) from baseline to 
week 48 were: +9.21 (8.99), 8.77 (8.95) and 7.86 (8.38) letters for 2q8 (n=167 patients), HDq12 (n=328 
patients) and HDq16 (n=163 patients) treatment groups respectively.  
The LS mean (SE) change of BCVA from baseline to week 48 were: +8.67 (0.73), 8.10 (0.61) and 7.23 (0.71) 
letters in 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 groups respectively with an estimated difference in LS means from baseline 
to Week 48 in BCVA (with corresponding 95% CI) changes and the p-values for the non-inferiority test at a 
margin of 4 letters of HDq12 vs. 2q8 was -0.57 (-2.26, 1.13; p-value <0.0001) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 
was -1.44 (-3.27, 0.39; p-value 0.0031). At week 60, 9.4 (0.77), 8.52 (0.63) and 7.64 (0.75) letters in 2q8 
(n=167 patients), HDq12 (n=328 patients) and HDq16 (n=163 patients) treatment were observed, respectively 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 169/235 
 
 
 
and differences between HDq12 vs. 2q8 was -0.88 (-2.67, 0.91; p-value 0.0003) letters and of HDq16 vs. 2q8 
was -1.76 (-3.71, 0.19; p-value 0.0122) letters.  
Subgroup analysis regarding the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 48 and Week 60 were performed and 
stratified by age, sex, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline BCVA letters, and baseline PCV in PHOTON 
study and discrepancies were noted in patients of ≥65 - <75 years, Black or African American and with a BCVA 
≥73 letters across the 3 treatment arms. However, given the smaller size of these subgroups, the validity of 
these comparisons appears limited. 
Overall, the primary and key secondary endpoint criteria, to know, the change from baseline in BCVA measured 
by  the  ETDRS  letter  score  at  Week  48  and  60  (non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  HDq12  and  HDq16 
dosing  regimen  to  the  current  authorized  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  2q8  dosing  regimen)  is  considered  to  be 
statistically met (95% credible interval for treatment difference with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with 
LS mean change from baseline in BCVA to Week 48) and were confirmed by sensitivity analysis.  
The  other  key  secondary  endpoint  concerned  the  proportion  of  participants  with  a  ≥2-Step  improvement  in 
DRSS  Score  at  Week  48.  At  week  48,  26.6%  participants  in  the  2q8  treatment  group  compared  to  29%  in 
HDq12 and 19.6% in HDq16arm had ≥2-Step improvement in DRSS Score with a difference (95% CI) between 
HDq12 vs. 2q8 treatment of 1.98% (-6.61, 10.57) and -7.52% (- 16.88, 1.84) for HDq16 vs. 2q8 treatment. 
Results at Week 60 followed the same tendency, with a proportion of participants with ≥ 2-step improvement 
in DRSS score of 29.1%, 31.3%, and 22.2% at week 60 in the 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16 groups, and an adjusted 
difference  (95%  CI)  versus  2q8  of  1.87  (-6.88,  10.63)  for  HDq12  and  -7.47  (-17.05,  2.12)  for  HDq16, 
respectively. The key secondary endpoint appears to be statistically met in the HDq12 arm but not in the HDq16 
and the sensitivity analyses supported the results at week 48 and 60. The MAH was requested to further discuss 
this point and the impact on the dosing regimen proposed in the SmPC. As a response, The Applicant concluded 
that all treatment arms achieved similar functional benefits. Differences in structural endpoints were mostly 
associated with injection timing and did not translate into clinically meaningful differences in quality of life or 
visual acuity. 
The  eligibility  criteria  of  the  PHOTON  study  aimed  to  include  an  informative  population  in  terms  of  DME 
assessment, which does not equate the one selected for DRSS assessment. In PHOTON, despite the limitations 
in study design, the evaluation of DRSS was included in the context of the fact that aflibercept 2 mg is in the 
US approved not only for the treatment of DME, but also for the treatment of DR. Therefore, evaluating the 
effects  of  aflibercept  8  mg  was  considered  relevant  for  that  territory.  The  key  secondary  endpoint  of  the 
proportion  of  participants  with  a  ≥  2-step  improvement  in  DRSS  score  at  Week  48  was  pre-specified  to 
potentially support an indication of aflibercept 8 mg for treatment of DR in the US. This endpoint was tested 
with a non-inferiority margin of 15% which was met by the HDq12 arm (adjusted difference 1.98%, 95% CI -
6.61,  10.57)  but  not  by  the  HDq16  arm  (adjusted  difference  -7.52%,  95%  CI  -16.88,  1.84).  however, 
considering that the primary endpoint showed that BCVA improvement as a direct effect of DME treatment was 
non-inferior for HDq12 and HDq16 compared to 2q8, the Applicant concluded that the effect on DRSS stage 
improvement does not correlate with the effect on DME, and improvements in DRSS are not a prerequisite for 
vision improvements in DME. 
Additionally, subgroups analysis by sex, age group, race, ethnicity, baseline BCVA, geographic region, baseline 
CRT category, and prior DME treatment were performed at 48 and 60 week and discrepancies in the HD groups 
compared to the 2q8 group were observed for the following subgroups: <50 years, ≥ 55- < 65 years, ≥ 65 to 
< 75 years, males, females, White, Asian, with a baseline BCVA ≤ 73 letters or ≥ 73 letters, and CRT  <400 
micron or ≥ 400 micron at baseline .  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 170/235 
 
 
Additionally, other secondary endpoints were analysed at week 48 and 60, such as: proportions of participants 
gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA, proportion of participants achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 
(approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent), proportion of participants without retinal fluid (total fluid, IRF, and/or 
SRF) at the foveal center, proportion of participants without leakage, mean change in CRT and the mean change 
in NEI-VQF-25 total score. Globally, results tend to differ in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups and some secondary 
and exploratory endpoints results tend to stand out more than others between groups with a worrying tendency 
not  in  favor  of  the  HD  regiment.  In  its  response,  the  Applicant  concluded  that  all  treatment  arms  achieved 
similar functional benefits. Differences in structural endpoints were mostly associated with injection timing and 
did not translate into clinically meaningful differences in quality of life or visual acuity. 
The  eligibility  criteria  of  the  PHOTON  study  aimed  to  include  an  informative  population  in  terms  of  DME

in study design, the evaluation of DRSS was included in the context of the fact that aflibercept 2 mg is in the

effects  of  aflibercept  8  mg  was  considered  relevant  for  that  territory.  The  key  secondary  endpoint  of  the 
proportion  of  participants  with  a  ≥  2-step  improvement  in  DRSS  score  at  Week  48  was  pre-specified  to 
potentially support an indication of aflibercept 8 mg for treatment of DR in the US. This endpoint was tested 
with a non-inferiority margin of 15% which was met by the HDq12 arm (adjusted difference 1.98%, 95% CI -
6.61,  10.57)  but  not  by  the  HDq16  arm  (adjusted  difference  -7.52%,  95%  CI  -16.88,  1.84).  however, 
considering that the primary endpoint showed that BCVA improvement as a direct effect of DME treatment was 
non-inferior for HDq12 and HDq16 compared to 2q8, the Applicant concluded that the effect on DRSS stage 
improvement does not correlate with the effect on DME, and improvements in DRSS are not a prerequisite for 
vision improvements in DME. 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The development plan and more specific points of aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of nAMD and DME subjects 
was discussed in the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/277944/2019. The MAH present 2 pivotal studies, one 
regarding each of the indication: PULSAR in patients with nAMD (phase 3 study) and PHOTON in patients with 
DME  (phase  2/3  study).  Both  studies  assessed  the  change  of  BCVA  (ETDRS score)  change  from  baseline  to 
week 48 as a primary endpoint and at week 60 as a key secondary endpoint. Those endpoints were considered 
statistically met for both the new proposed formula with the new dosing regimen (HDq12 and HDq16). However, 
given the large IVT injections intervals of the new dosing regimen at this point further long-term results were 
considered  as  mandatory  in  order  to  straighten  the  efficacy  results  for  both  HDq12  and  HDq16  treatment 
regimen in patients with nAMD and DME.  
As a remainder, the PHOTON and PULSAR studies met their primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority to 2 
mg  Eylea  at  the  dosing  intervals  of  HDq12  and  HDq16  after  48  weeks  in  both  indications  DME  and  nAMD. 
Moreover, the maintenance of efficacy were also confirmed after 60 weeks on the basis of the corresponding 
key secondary endpoint which also met non-inferiority 
Regarding this long-term 2 years efficacy results requested in order to ensure the maintenance of treatment 
efficacy, the Applicant provides long-term data from PULSAR study where around 80% of patients completed 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 171/235 
 
 
 
 
 
Week 96 and PHOTON study where 100% completed Week 96. Overall and based on the provided long-term 
data,  it  appears  that  the  product  dosed  every  12  weeks  (HDq12)  or  every  16  weeks  (HDq16)  showed 
maintained non-inferior efficacy through Week 96 compared to 2 mg aflibercept, consistent with the results 
demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to improvement in BCVA and CST in patients with nAMD 
or DME. Indeed, a snapshot of PULSAR data up to Week 96 was performed in May 2023. This dataset comprises 
all patients (100%) enrolled in PULSAR. Of ongoing patients, approximately 80% (689 out of 875) had already 
completed the Week 96 visit and almost all had completed visits up to Week 88. More precisely, of the 1009 
randomized patients included in the FAS and the SAF, 689 patients had completed the study through Week 96. 
137  patients  had  discontinued  prematurely.  For  186  patients  (18.4%),  according  to  the  Applicant,  these 
patients constitute the ongoing patients at the time of the data snapshot. 
Moreover,  regarding  the  second  part  of  the  MO  related  to  the  lack  of  sufficient  data  that  could  support  the 
claimed  q20  (or  longer)  intervals,  it  should  be  noted  that  through  Week  96,  up  to  47%  and  44.3%  of  HD 
patients  extended  their  treatment  interval  to  q20  or  longer  intervals  in  the  PULSAR  and  PHOTON  study 
respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 patients completed at least one q20 interval before 
Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24. 
2.5.7.  Clinical safety 
This  submission  summarizes  the  safety  data  for  aflibercept  8  mg  (114.3  mg/mL)  in  two  indications:  nAMD 
(phase  3  PULSAR  ongoing  and  phase  2  CANDELA  completed)  and  DME  (phase  2/3  PHOTON  ongoing).  The 
objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg (70µL of 114.3 mg/mL), every 12 or 16 
weeks compared to aflibercept 2 mg (50 µL of 40 mg/mL), every 8 weeks. In this submission, the safety data 
up to week 44 for the completed CANDELA study and up to week 48 and week 60 for the ongoing PULSAR and 
PHOTON studies were provided. The Applicant also provided as requested in the LoQ efficacy and safety data 
up to 96 weeks all patients in PHOTON and approximately 80% in PULSAR.   
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

The SAF included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (n=1115 patients 
for  nAMD  and  n=658  patients  for  DME).  Safety  variables  consisted  of  ocular  and  non-ocular  AEs  (including 
AESI ), ocular examination including IOP measurement, vital signs, clinical  laboratory testing and ECG. The 
Applicant also assessed safety topics of interest (ocular and non-ocular). For both PHOTON and PULSAR, the 2 
HD groups (i.e. HDq12 and HDq16) were pooled into the Pooled HD group and were also presented for the 2 
HD  groups  separately.  For  CANDELA  study,  only  the  Pooled  HD  group  was  presented  which  is  acceptable 
considering the size of the population (n=106).  
For description on dosing regimen modification, study design, demographic characteristics and medical history 
at  baseline,  see  Efficacy  section  and  clinical  AR.  Overall,  for  both  PULSAR  and  PHOTON,  the  Applicant  was 
requested  to  further  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  differences  regarding  demographic 
characteristics and reported medical history for nAMD and DME population in Efficacy section (see OC). In both 
AMD and DME studies, prior and concomitant treatments were reported in similar proportions and the most 
reported ATC in both indications were consistent with medical history.

2.5.7.1.  Patient exposure 
In PULSAR (nAMD), at week 60, the mean number of injections in the study eye were 8.5, 6.9 and 6.0 in the 
2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups respectively. In PHOTON (DME), patients received in 2q8, HDq12 
and  HDq16  respectively  10.0,  7.0  and  6.0  injections.  Overall,  this  is  coherent  with  the  protocol’s  dosing 
schedule.  
Up  to  week  96,  the  mean  number  of  injections  were  respectively  in  the  2q8,  HDq12  and  HDq16  treatment 
groups 12.8, 9.8 and 8.2 for PULSAR and 13.8, 9.5 and 7.8 for PHOTON. 
Assessment report

Patients in both phase 2/3 studies (PULSAR and PHOTON) were exposed to at least three times the dose of 
aflibercept in HD group compared to 2q8 group during the initiation phase. The Applicant provided safety data 
for the initiation phase in which all treatment arms received active monthly injection with either 2 mg or 8 mg 
aflibercept at day 1, week 4 and week 8.  Although exposures to aflibercept in the HD treatment arms in both 
PULSAR and PHOTON studies were higher during the loading phase and that the incidence of ocular TEAE in 
the  2q8  arms  in  both  groups  were  disparate,  safety  data  are  still  reassuring  and  in  favour  of  a  comparable 
safety  profile  with  ocular  and  non-ocular  TEAE  being  reported  in  similar  range  between  both  studies.  No 
consistent trend could be observed in both studies. 
Participants in PULSAR and PHOTON were eligible for dose interval shortening (to a minimum of q8) starting 
from  week  16  or  20  or  extension  (by  4-week  increments)  starting  from  week  52.  In  PULSAR,  the  majority 
(more than >75%) of the patients at week 48 and week 60 in HD group maintained their dosing regimen (q12 
or  q16).  Less  than  10%  of  the  HDq12  participants  shortened  to  HDq8  and  38.5%  of  the  patients  in  HDq16 
extended to HDq20 at week 60. In PHOTON, a large majority of the patients (more than 90%) maintained their 
assigned dosing regimen (HDq12 or HDq16) at week 48 and week 60. A total of 34.2% in HDq16 extended to 
HDq20 and 14.5% shortened to HDq12 or HDq8. In the fellow eye, slightly less patients received treatment in 
HD group (18.5% vs 20.2 % at week 60) in PULSAR while similar proportions were observed between groups 
in CANDELA and PHOTON.  
The Applicant provided safety data for the patients shortened to HDq8 and extended to HDq20 up to week 60. 
As the patient with an HDq20 interval regimen are less exposed, no worsening of the safety profile is expected. 
Safety  data  for  HDq8  were  submitted  and  compared  to  not  modified  HDq12/Hdq16  and  2q8.  No  consistent 
trend could be observed for higher reported ocular and non-ocular TEAE and the safety profile seems similar 
to the known safety profile of aflibercept 2 mg. In PHOTON in particular, lower ocular TEAE rates were reported.  
Up to week 96, the majority of the patient had a treatment interval of ≥ 12 weeks (all HD 87.1% PULSAR and

92.9% in PHOTON) and ≥ 16 weeks (all HD 69.2% PULSAR and 72.4% in PHOTON) and more than 40% of the 
patient in both studies had extended to q20 (46.6% in PULSAR and 44.8% in PHOTON). Proportion of patient 
shortened to HDq8 were higher for PULSAR (21.3% in all HD group) compared to PHOTON (10.6% in all HD 
group) and with a similar trend for proportions of patients in HDq8 regimen which were low in both studies and 
higher in nAMD population (13.1% in PULSAR and 7.3% in PHOTON). 
2.5.7.2.  Adverse events 
2.5.7.2.1.  nAMD indication (CANDELA and PULSAR) 
In CANDELA, for the study eye, a higher proportion of TEAE were reported in the HD group due to non-ocular 
TEAE being more reported (52.8% HD vs 45.3% IAI) while ocular TEAE were reported with similar frequencies 
(37.7% in both group). The most reported PT were vitreous detachment (higher in HD group) and nAMD (higher 
in IAI 2 mg group). Regarding non-ocular TEAE in CANDELA, while a higher frequency was reported in the HD 
group,  the  majority  of  the  TEAE  were  mild  or  moderate  and  the  proportion  of  severe  non-ocular  TEAE  was 
similar between the two groups.  
In PULSAR, at week 48 and 60, for the study eye, comparable proportion of TEAE (any TEAE, ocular TEAE and 
non-ocular TEAE) were reported between groups. While the SOC “Eye disorders” was reported in slightly higher

proportion in the HDq12 at week 48, proportions were comparable at week 60 (38.1% in 2q8 vs 37.1% in all 
HD group). The most reported ocular TEAEs consisted of “Visual acuity reduced”, “Cataract” (slightly higher in 
HDq12) and “Retinal haemorrhage”. Ocular events were for the majority mild or moderate in severity. Severe 
TEAE were reported in low and similar proportions with retinal haemorrhage, solely, being reported in more 
than one patient (n=2). Slight ddifferences can be observed up to week 60 between all HD group and 2q8 but 
also between HDq12 and HDq16 regarding the PT “Visual acuity reduced” (higher in HDq16 5.3% than in HDq12 
3.6%), “Vitreous floaters” (higher in HDq16 4.1% than HDq12 1.2%), “Vitreous detachment” (1.5% in 2q8 vs 
2.5% in HD group (3.0% in HDq16)), “nAMD” (0.6% vs 2.1% vs 2.1%), and “Macular oedema” (2.4% vs 0.3% 
vs 2.1%). However, incidences in the HDq12 arm were comparable to 2q8 or lowest although exposure is the 
highest except for the PT “nAMD” however this seems to reflect underlying conditions with similar proportions 
between HDq16 and 2q8 at week 96 which is not in favour of a dose related effect. For known PT, observed 
incidences remains below or in the same range as compared to the frequency listed for EYLEA 2 mg. 
Up to week 96, similar tendencies could be observed for ocular TEAE with slightly lower incidence in the HD 
group (53.6% in 2q8 vs 50.5§ in all HD). Most reported ocular PT were consistent with the known safety

profile of aflibercept and incidences were comparable except for cataract (listed ADR and important identified 
safety concern for aflibercept) however this could be explained by the reported medical history of cataract 
being higher in the HD group and comparable proportions were reported when looking at all PT related to 
cataract.  
Regarding non-ocular TEAE in PULSAR, more than half of the patient in all group reported at least one non-
ocular  TEAE  up  to  week  60  and  with  comparable  proportions.  The  most  reported  SOC  were  “Infections  and 
Infestations” (most reported PT being ”COVID-19”), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (slightly higher in HDq12, the 
most reported PT was” Nausea”) “Musculoskeletal and connective tissues disorders” (most reported PT was” 
Back  pain”)  and  “Vascular  disorders”  (higher  in  HDq12  8.7%  vs  5.4%  with  the  most  reported  PT  being 
‘Hypertension”). A higher incidence was reported for HDq16 compared to HDq12 at week 60 in the SOC Cardiac 
disorders (5.9% vs 3.0%), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (5.0% vs 2.7%) and Psychiatric disorders (2.7% 
vs  1.2%).  However,  this  is  not  in  favour  of  a  dose  related  effects  as  lower  incidences  were  reported  in  the 
HDq12 arm in which exposure is the highest. Additionally, these differences could be explained by the higher 
incidences  of  medical  history  of  hypertension  and  psychiatric  disorders.  When  looking  per  TEAE  (SOC 
gastrointestinal disorders), events were low or reported in single patients. Up to week 96, similar tendencies 
could be observed.  
Non-ocular TEAE were mostly mild to moderate in severity and severe non-ocular TEAE were more reported in 
the 2q8 group (8.3% vs 5.1% in HDq12 and 3.6% in HDq16). At week 60, similar tendencies were observed.

In CANDELA, for the study eye, one ocular TEAE (iritis, mild, non-serious) and one non-ocular TEAE 
(Transient ischemic attack, mild, serious) in the HD group were assessed as drug study related. Proportion of 
injection related ocular TEAE were similar between groups (7.5%) with the most reported PT being 
Conjunctival haemorrhage (2 patients in IAI 2 mg and 3 in HD group) and one non-ocular TEAE ( Facial pain) 
was assessed as injection related in IAI while none in the HD group. No TEAEs were assessed as protocol–
specified procedure related. In the fellow eye, ocular TEAE were reported in similar proportion in both groups 
(24.5%) with the most reported ocular TEAE being Conjunctival haemorrhage (higher in HD group) and 
nAMD (higher in HD). No severe ocular TEAE were reported. No ocular TEAE were assessed as study drug 
related and one event of “Conjunctival haemorrhage” in both groups were assessed as injection procedure 
related. No serious ocular TEAE were reported.

In PULSAR, ocular study drug related TEAE in the study eye were reported in higher proportion in the HD 
group (higher in HDq12: 6.0%) compared to 2q8 group (3.6%) at week 48. All reported PT occurred with low 
incidence (<1%). PT reported in more than one patient (all PT were reported in less than 1%) at week 48 
and 60 were “Visual Acuity Reduced” (in HD groups only and higher in HDq12), “Retinal pigment epithelial 
tear” (higher in HDq12), “Age-related macular degeneration” (higher in HDq12) and “Intraocular pressure 
increased” (higher in 2q8 group). Non-ocular study drug related TEAEs were reported in similar proportions 
between groups and PT reported in more than one patient were “Myocardial infarction” (in HDq16, n=2 at 
week 96) and “Cerebrovascular accident” for non-ocular TEAE (in 2q8 group, both serious). Up to week 96, 
similar tendencies were observed.

At  week  48  and  60,  proportions  of  ocular  TEAE  related  to  IVT  were  slightly  higher  in  2q8  group  and  slight 
differences could be observed between HD group and 2q8 and HDq12 and HDq16 (7.1% in 2q8 vs 6.9% in 
HDq12 vs 8.9% in HDq16 at week 60). At week 96, similar proportions were observed (9.2% in 2q8, 8.7% in 
HDq12 and 9.5% HDq16). The most reported PT for ocular TEAE assessed as related to IVT were “Conjunctival 
haemorrhage”, “Vitreous floaters» and “Sensation of foreign body”.  Incidences in HDq12 (highest exposure) 
were lower or comparable to observed incidences in 2q8. The majority of the events were reported in single 
patients. Non-ocular TEAE assessed as related to IVT injection were reported in the HD group only (in solely 
one  patient  in  each  HD  group)  and  consisted  of  chest  pain,  cerebral  ischemia,  head  discomfort,  headache, 
trigeminal neuralgia and hypertension. The Applicant provided the narratives of the cases and all event were

majorly non serious, resolved, mild to moderate in intensity and with no drug change. Ocular and non-ocular 
TEAE assessed as protocol-specified procedure related were low and comparable between groups. The most 
reported PT consisted of “Corneal abrasion” (0.6% at week 60 in HD group) for ocular TEAE and “Nausea” and 
“Vomiting” for non-ocular TEAE.  
In the fellow eye at week 48, ocular TEAE were reported in similar proportions with the most reported PT 
being nAMD. One event of Cataract (HDq16) and one event of nAMD (2q8) were assessed as drug related. 
Similar proportions of injection and protocol required procedure related ocular TEAE were reported and the 
most reported PT was “Conjunctival haemorrhage”. Ocular TEAE were mostly mild to moderate and severe 
TEAE were reported in low proportions and in single participants only. At week 60, similar tendencies were 
observed. Additional events of “Iridocyclitis” (HDq16) and “Endophthalmitis” (2q8) were assessed as drug 
related.  Up to week 96, similar tendencies were overall observed.  
2.5.7.2.2.  DME indication (PHOTON) 
At week 48, TEAE were more reported in all HD group (70.3%) than in the 2q8 (63.5%) and proportions were 
slightly higher in the HDq16 (72.4%) than in the HDq12 (69.2%).  
Ocular TEAE in study eye were reported in slightly higher incidences (31.0% in all HD group vs 27.5% in 2q8). 
Non-ocular TEAE were reported in higher proportion in HDq16 group (58.3%) than in the 2q8 group (47.3%) 
and the HDq12 group (53.0%). Similar tendencies were observed at week 96.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

The most reported PT for ocular TEAE in the study eye were IOP (in higher proportions with 3.6% in 2q8 group), 
vitreous floaters (in higher proportions with 4.9% in HDq12 group), retinal haemorrhage (in higher proportions 
with  4.9%  in  HDq16  group),  Conjunctival  haemorrhage  (comparable  proportions)  and  Cataract  (in  higher 
proportions with 4.9% in HDq16 group). Ocular TEAE in the study eye were for the majority mild in severity 
and in higher proportions in the HDq16 group (28.2% in HDq16 vs 26.2 % in HDq12 vs 22.8% in 2q8 at week 
60) although exposure was highest in the HDq12 and this could be explained due to higher reported medical 
history in HDq16. Comparable proportions were observed between the 2q8 and HDq12 arms, comparable or 
higher  proportion  were  reported  in  the  fellow  eye  which  is  not  in  favour  of  a  drug-related  treatment  effect. 
Reported ocular TEAEs were consistent with the known safety profile of aflibercept and underlying conditions. 
Incidence of ocular TEAE in the fellow eye were comparable with the study eye and between the HDq16 group 
(27.6%) and the 2q8 group (26.3%) but reported in less proportion in the HDq12 group (31.7% in the study 
eye vs 23.8% in the fellow eye). Higher incidences of injection related TEAE were reported for the study eye 
compared  to  the  fellow  eye  in  all  groups.  Ocular  TEAE  in  the  fellow  eye  were  for  the  majority  mild  and  in 
comparable proportions between all groups. The most reported PT in the fellow eye were Cataract, vitreous 
floaters and diabetic retinopathy. At week 60, similar tendencies were observed.

The  most  reported  non-ocular  TEAE  (more  than  10%)  were  the  SOC  Infections  and  infestations,  Vascular 
disorders (with the PT Hypertension reported in similar proportions between all HD group and 2q8 group: 9.6% 
and  slightly  higher  in  HDq16  12.3%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (Higher  in  HD  group)  and  Metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders. Events were either reported majorly in single patients or could be due to a higher medical 
history for these SOCs being reported in HDq16 arm.  Non-ocular TEAE were for the majority mild (in higher 
proportion 30.7% in HDq16 vs 25.0 % in HDq12 vs 25.7% in 2q8 at week 60) or moderate in severity.  
Study drug related TEAE were ocular TEAE for the majority and reported in less than 2% of the patients and 
proportions were similar between all HD group and 2q8 group. The only TEAE reported in more than one patient 
up to week 48 and 60 was IOP increase (3 patient 0.9% in the HDq12 group only). One non-ocular study drug 
related TEAE was reported in the HDq16 group (Lacunar infarction) through week 48 and 60. The Applicant 
provided the case narrative as requested. The event occurred in a bilaterally treated patients with confounding 
factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia) and resolved with no treatment and no recurrence were observed. 
Up  to  week  96,  similar  tendencies  were  observed.  One  additional  event  of  cerebrovascular  accident  was 
reported at week 96 (HDq16).

Injection  related  TEAE  were  ocular  TEAE  for  the  majority  and  slightly  more  reported  in  the  HDq12  group 
(13.1%) than HDq16 (8.0%) but in similar proportions between 2q8 group (10.8%) and all HD group (11.4%). 
Ocular  IVT-injection-related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  more  than  2  patients  in  all  groups  up  to  week  48  for 
Conjunctival haemorrhage, Eye pain (comparable proportions between all HD group and 2q8 for all three PT), 
Intraocular eye pressure increased (slightly higher in 2q8 group 2.4% vs 1.2% in all HD group) and Vitreous 
floaters (slightly higher in HDq12 2.1% vs 0.6% in other groups).  Ocular IVT-injection-related TEAEs in the 
fellow eye were reported in similar proportions between all groups.  
Non-ocular IVT-injection-related TEAEs in the HD group only (3 patients 0.6% in all HD group) and consisted 
of Nausea, Vomiting and Headache.

Incidence of protocol procedure related TEAE were low (none in the HDq16), consisted for the majority of non-
ocular  TEAE  and  were  comparable  between  HDq12  group  and  2q8  group.  Ocular  TEAEs  related  to  other 
protocol-specified procedures in the study eye were reported in low proportions and in the HDq12 group only 
(Conjunctival haemorrhage and Injection site irritation). No ocular study-conduct-related TEAEs in the fellow 
eye were reported.  
Non-ocular TEAEs related to other protocol-specified procedures were reported in low proportions and included 
Nausea,  Vessel  puncture  site  haematoma,  Contrast  media  allergy,  Post  procedural  pruritus,  Rash,  and  Vein 
rupture. Overall, similar tendencies were observed up to week 96. 
2.5.7.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
2.5.7.3.1.  nAMD indication (CANDELA and PULSAR) 
In CANDELA study, one patient died of glioblastoma in HD group after study discontinuation and was not 
assessed as related to study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 186/235 
 
 
 
 
In PULSAR, a total of 9 deaths occurred at week 48 (1.5% in 2q8, 0.9% in HDq12 and 0.3% in HDq16) and 
one additional death (PT sepsis) was recorded at week 60. None were assessed as related to study drug. Up to 
week 96, incidences of deaths were lower in the HD group (2.1% and 3.6% in PULSAR).  
In CANDELA, ocular serious TEAE occurred in three patients (1 event of “Visual acuity reduced “in IAI 2 mg 
and 2 events of “Retinal tear” and “Visual impairment” in HD group). None were assessed as drug related and 
no  action  with  drug  were  taken.  One  severe  event  of  “Retinal  tear”  was  assessed  as  injection  related.  Non 
ocular serious TEAE were reported in similar proportions. One mild event of “Transient ischemic attack” was 
assessed as study related and occurred with a TTO of 2 months after last dose in a patient with risk factors. 
In PULSAR, ocular serious TEAE were reported in low proportions (<2%) with a slightly higher frequency in the 
HD group at both week 48 and 60. Reported ocular SAE at week 48 and 60 occurring in n≥2 were “Retinal 
haemorrhage” (in both HD groups) and “IOP increased” (in HDq12). The majority of serious ocular TEAE in the 
Assessment report

study  eye  were  moderate  in  intensity.  Ocular  serious  TEAE  assessed  as  drug  study  related  at  week  60  was 
“Angle closure glaucoma” (1 in HDq16). Ocular serious TEAEs assessed as IVT injection procedure related were 
“Angle  closure  glaucoma”  (HDq16)  “Skin  laceration”  (HDq16)  “Endophthalmitis”  (2q8)  and  “IOP  increased” 
(HDq12). For the fellow eye, ocular serious TEAE were reported in similar proportion and none were assessed 
as related. The majority of serious ocular TEAE in the fellow eye were moderate in intensity. Up to week 96, 
serious ocular TEAE were low in rate and proportions were slightly higher in all HD group (2.8% vs 1.2% in 
2q8) in PULSAR. In both PHOTON and PULSAR, most serious TEAE were reported in single patients (except for 
cataract (n=2 HDq16), retinal detachment (n=5 all HD group), retinal hemorrhage (n=4 all HD group) and IOP 
increase (n=2 HDq12) for PULSAR and vitreous detachment (n=2 HDq16) for PHOTON)). 
Non-ocular serious TEAE were observed in similar proportions with comparable frequency between groups for 
each reported SOCs at week 48 and 60. Non-ocular serious TEAE assessed as drug related occurred in 6 patients 
(2 in HDq16 and 4 in 2q8). The most reported serious TEAE assessed as study related was “Cerebrovascular 
accident” (n=2) observed in 2q8. Additionally, one event of “Chest pain” in HDq12 occurred on the day of the 
first injection in a 91 years old patient with history of hypertension and was attributed to anxiety. The event 
was assessed as injection and procedure related and resolved on the same day. The majority of serious non-
ocular TEAE were moderate in intensity. Most reported serious non-ocular PT were consistent with underlying 
conditions and no similar trends were seen between both studies.  
AESI 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

AESI were presented by the Applicant for each study and consisted of intraocular inflammation, IOP increase, 
retinal  pigment  epithelium  tear,  retinal  tear/detachment,  cataract,  hypersensitivity,  arterial  thromboembolic 
events  and  adjudicated  Anti-platelet  Trialists’  Collaboration  (APTC)  events,  venous  thromboembolic  events, 
hypertension, non-ocular bleedings, and nasal mucosal findings. 
• 
Intraocular inflammation (IOI) 
For CANDELA, one mild, non-serious, resolved event of Iritis and assessed as related to study drug was reported 
in the HD group. Low and comparable proportions of TEAE of intraocular inflammation were reported for PULSAR 
in  HD  group  and  2q8  at  week  48  and  60.  Events  were  non-serious,  mild  for  the  majority  and  resolved  or 
resolving. 2 cases of Endophthalmitis were reported in the 2q8 groups at week 60. No cases of Occlusive retinal 
vasculitis were reported. In the 2q8 group and in the HDq16, one event (each) of Iridocyclitis were assessed 
as related to study drug.  
Up to week 96, no cases of Endophthalmitis, ocular vasculitis and occlusive retinitis were reported for the all 
HD group.  
• 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

In CANDELA, no TEAEs of Intraocular pressure increased or Ocular hypertension were reported. In PULSAR, 
comparable proportion of IOP increase were observed. Majority of the events were mild and non-serious. The 
frequencies of pre- and post-injection IOP increase from baseline at all values (≥ 10 mmHg through ≥ 35 mmHg) 
were comparable across groups at week 48 and 60. In both studies, pre-dose intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg 
at any visit was numerically higher in the HD group however there were no clinically meaningful trends in mean 
or median changes from baseline in pre-dose intraocular pressure in the study eye in either treatment group. 
Similar tendencies were observed up to week 96.  
•  Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
In  CANDELA,  one  non-serious,  mild  and  unrelated  event  of  Retinal  pigment  epithelial  tear  was  reported.  In 
PULSAR, frequencies of Retinal pigment epithelial tear were higher in HDq12 at week 48 and 60. Events were 
mild or moderate, non-serious and not resolved for the majority of the patients. Five were assessed as drug 
related (4 in the pooled HD) and one event was assessed as related to IVT procedure.  
RPE tear is a known and listed ADR for Eylea 2 mg/8 mg. Although a higher proportion was reported at week 
48 and 60 for HDq12 compared to HDq16 and 2q8; the rate of 1.8% is in line with the pooled incidence found 
in previous studies in AMD (VIEW 1/VIEW 2) which was 1.6%. Furthermore, all events of RPE tears occurred 
up to 12 weeks (loading phase) in which exposure to Eylea was similar between HDq12 and HDq16 groups and 
similar proportions were reported for HDq16 and 2q8 (0,9%). Thus occurrence of RPE tears does not seems to 
be dose-dependent or injection frequency related.

•  Retinal tear/detachment 
In CANDELA, no events of retinal detachment were reported and retinal tear occurred in 2 patients in HD group. 
Events were assessed as unrelated, one serious retinal tear was resolved and treated by laser while the other 
was non-serious, mild and not resolved. At week 48 and 60, 6 patients presented “Retinal detachment/retinal 
tear” in the study eye (3 in the HDq12 group). One patient in the HDq16 group discontinued the study drug 
and events of retinal detachment and retinal tear were serious in one patient in HDq12 and one patient in 2q8. 
Events were for the majority moderate, assessed as unrelated to study drug or IVT and resolved or resolved 
with sequelae.  
•  Cataract 
In  CANDELA,  two  non-serious,  non-related  events  of  cataract  (1  Cataract  subcapsular  in  IAI  2mg  and  1 
Posterior capsule opacification) occurred in the study eye. In PULSAR patients in the HDq16 group had more 
reported  medical  history  of  cataract  (60.9%  vs  50.4%  in  the  HDq12  and  53.9  in  the  2q8  group)  while 
proportions  were  similar  between  the  pooled  HD  group  and  the  2q8  group.  At  week  48  and  60,  events  of 
cataract were reported in comparable proportions between all groups and all events were for the majority non-
serious, mild or moderate and assessed as unrelated (in HDq16 one event was related to study drug and one 
to  IVT,  in  2q8  one  event  was  related  to  IVT).  No  events  lead  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  However, 
considering the imbalance of incidence of cataract as medical history for the study eye at baseline, the Applicant 
was  requested  to  provide  further  discussion  on  the clinical  relevance  (discussed  in  Efficacy  section).  Similar 
tendencies  were  observed  up  to  week  96,  incidences  were  9.1%  in  all  HD  group  vs  6.5%  2q8  for  PULSAR. 
Higher  proportions  of  TEAE  were  also  seen  for  subtypes  of  cataract  (cataract  cortical,  cataract  nuclear  and 
cataract subcapsular) but when looking at pooled data slightly lower or comparable proportions were reported

between all HD and 2q8 groups (frequency uncommon for all in SmPc Eylea 8 mg). Cataract is listed in the 
SmPc  of  Eylea  2  mg  (common:  8%)  and  Eylea  8  mg  (common:  4%)  and  is  an  important  identified  safety 
concern in the RMP of Eylea. 
•  Hypersensitivity 
No  events  of  Hypersensitivity  were  reported  in  CANDELA.  In  PULSAR,  incidences  were  low  and  comparable. 
Events were mild or moderate, non-serious and not assessed as related to study drug. 
•  Arterial thromboembolic events/APTC 
In CANDELA, one serious, mild in intensity, assessed as related to study drug and resolved event of Transient 
ischaemic attack occurred in HD group. Incidences for APTC events were low and events were less reported 
in the HD group compared to 2q8 group.

Arterial  thromboembolic  events  were  reported  in  slightly  higher  proportion  in  HDq12  (3.3%  vs  1.1%)    but 
events  were  overall  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  resolved.  Events  of  Angina  pectoris,  Cerebrovascular 
accident  and  Transient  ischaemic  attack  were  reported  in  more  than  1  patient.  Frequencies  in  SOC  Cardiac 
disorders  and  Nervous  system  disorders  were  low  and  comparable.  No  dose  dependency  was  observed.  At 
week 96, for ATE events, incidences were low and similar proportions were reported in both studies (ATEs 4.8% 
2q8 and 5.3% all HD group for PULSAR).  
•  Venous thromboembolic events 
No venous thromboembolic events were reported in CANDELA. In PULSAR, at week 48 and 60, incidences 
were low and comparable. Two serious events were reported Pulmonary embolism (resolved, in patient 
treated by bilateral therapy, in HDq16 group) assessed as related to study drug and Venous thrombosis limb 
(resolved, in HDq12 group) not assessed as related. Both events were severe in severity.

In CANDELA, one non-serious, mild event of hypertension was reported. Medical history of hypertension was 
reported  in  2/3  of  the  patients  (60.7%  in  2q8  and  65.5  in  pooled  HD  group).  Incidence  of  hypertension  in 
PULSAR  was  slightly  higher  in  the  pooled  HD  group  and  similar  between  HDq12  and  HDq16.  One  mild  in 
severity, serious, non-related event of hypertension was reported in HDq12.  
Assessment report

No increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed. As hypertension is a 
listed event for aflibercept administered by IV although at a much higher posology, the topic is actually followed 
through the PSUR and that a difference could be observed up to week 60, the Applicant further discussed on 
the topic of Hypertension with the newly proposed regimen. At week 96, incidences were similar in PULSAR 
(2q8:  7.4%,  all  HD  8.0%).  Proportion  of  patient  with  medical  history  of  hypertension  was  similar  with  and 
without  hypertension  event  although  higher  blood  pressures  at  baseline  were  higher  in  HD  group  (PULSAR: 
141  mmHg  (SBP)/77.3  mmHg  (DBP)  vs  133.3  mmHg  (SBP)/76.4  mmHg  (DBP)).  In  PULSAR,  the  lowest 
incidence (15,5%) was reported in HDq12 group in which the exposure is the highest. Onset of hypertension 
TEAEs over time (up to week 60) were well distributed and is not in favour of a correlated aflibercept induced 
hypertension. Pooled mean changes in blood pressure (CANDELA/PULSAR/PHOTON) for 8 mg were lower than 
the  baseline  through  week  60.  Pre-defined  treatment-emergent  potentially  clinically  significant  values  of 
systolic  blood  pressure  related  to  elevations  and  decrease  were  comparable  or  slightly  higher  in  the  all  HD 
group  for  both  PULSAR  and  PHOTON.  Compared  to  previous  experience  with  Eylea  2  mg,  similar  or  higher 
incidence were observed at 1 and 2 year in the 2 mg group compared to week 60 and 96 with 8 mg (for DME

25.8 % 2 mg at 2 years vs 17.3% at week 96 for all HD and for AMD 14.7% 2 mg at 2 years vs 8.0% at week 
96 for all HD).   Furthermore, the risk of hypertension is currently monitored through the PSUR.  
•  Non-ocular haemorrhages and Nasal mucosal findings 
In CANDELA, no events of non-ocular haemorrhages were reported. In PULSAR, at week 48 and 60, incidences 
were comparable and events were for the majority non-serious, mild in intensity and resolved. Four serious 
non-ocular  haemorrhage  events  were  reported  (one  event  of  Epistaxis  in  HDq16  and  events  of  blood  loss 
anaemia, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and cystitis haemorrhagic).  
In CANDELA, no TEAE of nasal mucosal findings were reported. In PULSAR, at week 48 and 60, 2 events (one 
serious, moderate, unrelated and resolved) of Epistaxis in HDq16 were reported. 
2.5.7.3.2.  DME indication (PHOTON) 
A total of 16 deaths occurred up to week 48 and 2 additional deaths were recorded up to week 60. All deaths 
were associated to an SAE and none were considered as related to study drug or study procedure. The most 
reported SOC was Cardiac disorders (3 deaths in each group at week 60). The cause of death was unknown for 
2  patients  in  HDq12  group  and  for  one  patient  in  HDq12.  All  three  patients  had  cardiovascular  risk  factors 
(cardiac stent, hypertension,) and the chronology did not evocate a causal relationship with aflibercept.  Up to 
week 96, incidences of deaths were lower in the HD group (4.7% vs 5.4% 2q8 in PHOTON). 
Assessment report

Up to week 48 and 60, 5 ocular serious TEAE occurred in 4 participants and consisted of Ulcerative keratitis 
(moderate in intensity) in 2q8, Cataract subcapsular (severe in intensity), and Intraocular pressure increased 
in HDq12 (moderate in severity, assessed as related to injection procedure) and Retinal detachment (severe 
in  intensity)  and  Vitreous  haemorrhage  (severe  in  intensity)  in  HDq16.  All  events,  except  for  Vitreous 
haemorrhage, resolved. In the fellow eye, 11 ocular serious TEAE occurred and none were assessed as related 
to study drug. Up to week 96, serious ocular TEAE were low in rate and proportions were similar in PHOTON 
(1.2%). In both PHOTON and PULSAR, most serious TEAE were reported in single patients (except for cataract 
(n=2 HDq16), retinal detachment (n=5 all HD group), retinal hemorrhage (n=4 all HD group) and IOP increase 
(n=2 HDq12) for PULSAR and vitreous detachment (n=2 HDq16) for PHOTON)).

Regarding non-ocular serious TEAE, similar proportions were reported between treatment arms and none were 
assessed as related to study drug. The most reported SOC was Cardiac disorders reported in slightly higher 
proportion in the 2q8 group at week 48 but in similar proportion between 2q8 group (5.4%) and all HD group 
(5.5%) at week 60. The SOC Nervous system disorders was reported in higher proportion in the HDq16 group 
(3.7%) and the PT Cerebrovascular accident was reported with higher incidence in HDq16 (4 in the HDq16, 2 
in the HD12 and none in the 2q8) of which none were assessed as drug related. Furthermore, HDq16 arm had 
higher reported medical history of hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity and incidences 
in the HDq12 arm and 2q8 arm were similar. 
Up  to  week  96,  lower  proportions  were  observed  in  PHOTON  (2q8:  25.1,  all  HD:  23.2%)  with  PT  majorly 
reported in single patients. Most reported serious non-ocular PT were consistent with underlying conditions and 
no similar trends were seen between both studies.

Ocular TEAE of intraocular inflammation in the study eye occurred for the majority in the HDq12 group with 
comparable  proportions  between  all  HD  group  and  2q8  (none  in  the  HDq16  group).  No  events  of 
Endophthalmitis and no Occlusive retinal vasculitis were reported. All events were mild or moderate, non-
serious and all resolved apart from one event of iritis in the HDq12 assessed as study drug related which 
lead to study discontinuation.  
Up to week 96, no cases of Endophthalmitis, ocular vasculitis and occlusive retinitis were reported for the 
all HD group in PHOTON and overall incidence of IOI events are low and comparable between arms.   
• 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) increase 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

TEAE of IOP increase and Ocular hypertension were slightly more reported in the 2q8 group than in the HDq12 
and  the  HDq16  groups.  Furthermore,  more  events  were  reported  in  the  HDq12  than  the  HDq16  (3.4%  vs 
0.6%). All events were mild or moderate and non-serious apart from one TEAE of IOP increase in the HDq12 
group (moderate, resolved on the same day and related to injection procedure). 
Number of patients with pre-dose IOP ≥25 mmHg was higher in HDq12 (3.7% vs 1.2% in 2q8 and 1.8% in 
HDq16) however no relevant clinical differences could be observed regarding mean change in pre-injection IOP. 
IOP incidence was highest in the 2q8 arm (4.2% vs 3.4% in HDq12 and 0.6% in HDq16) in which there was 
the lowest aflibercept exposure in the compared to HDq12 and HDq16. 
•  Retinal pigment epithelial tear  
No events of Retinal pigment epithelial tear were reported in PHOTON. 
•  Retinal tear/detachment 
One serious and severe in severity event of Retinal detachment assessed as unrelated to study drug or injection 
procedure  occurred  in  the  HDq16  group  after  2  injections  (TTO  58  days  after  first  dose).  The  patient  also 
experienced  vitreous  haemorrhage  which  was  severe  in  severity.  The  patient  was  treated  for  the  event  of 
Retinal detachment. Both events resolved (on day 124) after drug interruption and study drug was resumed 
on day 134.

•  Cataract  
Medical history of cataract in the study eye were more reported in the HDq16 group (39.3% vs 34.5% in the 
HDq12 and 33.5% in the 2q8 group). Events of cataract were slightly more reported in the HDq16 group (4.9%) 
than in the HDq12 group (1.5%) and 2q8 group (1.2%). All events were non-serious, mild or moderate except 
one event of Cataract Subcapsular (serious and severe in intensity in the HDq12 group) which occurred after 
2 injections and was associated with visual acuity loss. The event was resolved after cataract surgery. The dose 
of study drug was unchanged. The event was assessed as unrelated to study drug and injection procedure. 
Similar tendencies were observed up to week 96, incidence of cataract were 7.5% in all HD vs 3.6% for 2q8 
for PHOTON. Higher proportions of TEAE were also seen for subtypes of cataract (cataract cortical, cataract 
nuclear and cataract subcapsular) but when looking at pooled data slightly lower or comparable proportions 
were reported between all HD and 2q8 groups (frequency uncommon for all in SmPc Eylea 8 mg). Cataract is 
listed in the SmPc of Eylea 2 mg (common: 8%) and Eylea 8 mg (common: 4%) and is an important identified 
safety concern in the RMP of Eylea. 
•  Hypersensitivity 
Assessment report

TEAE events of Hypersensitivity were reported in less than 2% of the participants in all groups and reported in 
similar proportions between all HD group and 2q8 group. All events were non-serious, mild in intensity and 
unrelated to study drug. 
•  Arterial thromboembolic events/APTC 
Medical  history  of  myocardial  infarction  was  reported  in  higher  proportions  in  the  HDq16  (7.4%  vs  6.1%  in 
HDq12 and 4.8% in the 2q8 group). Incidences of APTC events were low and slightly higher in the HDq16 group 
(4.3% vs 3.6% in the 2q8 group and 2.4% in the HDq12 group at week 48) with similar observed tendencies 
at week 60. 
Arterial  thromboembolic  events  were  more  reported  in  the  HDq16  group  and  2q8  group  than  in  the  HDq12 
group  (6.7%  vs  6.0%  vs  3.4%  respectively).  The  majority  of  the  patient  had  no  medical  history  of 
cerebrovascular  disease  and  the  incidence  of  patient  with  such  medical  history  were  reported  in  higher 
proportion in the 2q8 group (11.4% vs 7.6% in all HD group). The PT of Cerebrovascular incidents was reported 
in higher incidence in the HDq16 group (2.5%) and none occurred in the 2q8 group. No events were assessed 
as related to study drug. Although ATE events were more reported in the HDq16 group and 2q8 group than in 
the HDq12 group (6.7% vs 6.0% vs 3.4% respectively), the cumulative exposure was the highest in the HDq12 
which showed the lowest incidence (3.4%).  
•  Venous thromboembolic events 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

TEAE of venous thrombosis were reported in less than 1% of the participants at week 48 and 60. One non-
serious and moderate in severity event of Deep vein thrombosis and two serious and severe in intensity event 
of pulmonary embolism were reported in the HDq12 group. None were assessed as related to study drug.  
•  Hypertension  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

More than 75% of the patient had medical history of hypertension. In the SOC “Vascular disorders” the most 
reported PT  was “Hypertension” with a higher incidence in the group HDq16 (12.3% vs 8.2% in the HDq12 
group and 9.6% in the 2q8 group at week 48 and with similar tendencies at week 60). The majority of the 
events were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity.  At week 48 and 60, the majority of the patient who 
reported  a  TEAE  of  hypertension  had  reported  medical  history  of  hypertension  and  similar  proportions  were 
reported between all groups. Variation in mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
through week 48 and week 60 were clinically not significant.  
As hypertension is a listed event for aflibercept administered by IV although at a much higher posology, the 
topic is actually followed through the PSUR and that a difference could be observed up to week 60, the Applicant 
further discussed on the topic of Hypertension with the newly proposed regimen. At week 96, incidences were 
comparable  in  PHOTON  (2q8:  16.2  %,  all  HD  17.3  %).  Proportion  of  patients  with  medical  history  of 
hypertension was similar with and without hypertension event although higher blood pressures at baseline were 
higher  in  HD  group  (PHOTON:  138.3  mmHg  (SBP)/78.8  mmHg  (DBP)  vs  133.1  mmHg  (SBP)/74.6  mmHg 
(DBP)). Onset of hypertension TEAEs over time (up to week 60) were well distributed and is not in favour of a

(CANDELA/PULSAR/PHOTON) for 8 mg were lower than the baseline through week 60. Pre-defined treatment-
emergent potentially clinically significant values of systolic blood pressure related to elevations and decrease

hypertension is currently monitored through the PSUR.  
•  Non-ocular haemorrhage and Nasal mucosal findings 
Assessment report

At  week  48,  higher  proportions  of  non-ocular  haemorrhage  were  reported  in  the  2q8  group  with  the  most 
reported PT being “Contusion” (1.8% in the 2q8 group, all event were mild or moderate). Events were for the 
majority non serious, mild or moderate and none were assessed as related to study drug. Serious TEAE were 
reported in low and similar proportions (less than 1% of the participants) in 2q8 group and HDq12 group.  
One event of non-serious and moderate blood loss anaemia was reported in a patient in the 2q8 group. The 
patient  was  discontinued  of  the  study  due  to  serious  TEAE  all  assessed  as  not  related  to  aflibercept  2  mg 
(malnutrition,  Post  procedural  infection,  Multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome,  Cholecystitis  acute).  No 
participants reported nasal mucosal events.  
2.5.7.4.  Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant findings in the mean or median changes from baseline in PULSAR and PHOTON were 
observed. Furthermore, no significant trend in vital signs or ECG in any of the two studies were observed.

Not applicable. 
2.5.7.6.  Safety in special populations 
2.5.7.6.1.  Subgroup analysis 
The Applicant provided ocular and non-ocular by age, sex, ethnicity, geographic region and medical history 
(hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease, renal and hepatic impairment) for PULSAR 
and PHOTON. For both studies, at week 48 and 60, differences could be observed for ocular adverse events 
and non-ocular TEAE with higher proportions for HDq12 by categories of age and for the Japan subgroups

(10% in PULSAR and 20% in PHOTON of included patients were Asian). However, taking into account the low 
number of participants included in the subgroups, these results should be interpreted with caution. For other 
analysed subgroups, no safety concerns can be raised regarding the submitted data for both studies.   
2.5.7.6.2.  Bilateral therapy 
In CANDELA, a small proportion of patients received bilateral treatment which consisted of a population in HD 
group  with  higher  proportion  of  history  of  nAMD  in the  fellow  eye  (54.5%),  medical  history  of  hypertension 
(81.8% vs 40.5%), medical history of CVA stroke (compared to IAI bilateral 9.1% vs 0%) and moderate renal 
impairment  (18.2%  vs  4.8%).  In  PULSAR  and  PHOTON,  ≤20%  and  ≥50%  of  the  patients  received  bilateral 
therapy with aflibercept 2 mg in the fellow eye.  
In PULSAR, less than 20% of the patient received bilateral treatment in the pooled HD group. The population 
consisted of patient with higher proportion of patient aged ≥75 years old and with a medical history of nAMD in 
the fellow eye (46.5% in bilateral all HD group). The bilateral population also had slightly higher proportion of 
medical history hypertension (70% vs 65.5 % in HDq12), medical history of CVA stroke (11.6% vs 8.1% in all 
HD  group)  and  renal  impairment  (20%  vs  15.3%  in  HDq12).    Furthermore,  a  higher  proportion  of  vitreous 
detachment  (16.3%  vs  6.6%)  and  cataract  operation  (36.4%  vs  21.5%)  were  observed  in  all  HD  group. 
Regarding non-ocular medical history, comparable proportions were reported between unilateral and bilateral 
treated patients. Higher proportions were reported for the bilateral treatment for the SOC Musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders  (higher  in  all  HD  39.5%  vs  31.6%)  and  Nervous  system  disorders  (28.7%  vs 
18.8%).   
While frequencies of ocular TEAEs were similar between groups, a higher frequency of non-ocular TEAE was 
reported (62.0%% for bilateral vs 50.9% for unilateral) in the HD group. The most reported ocular TEAE in 
bilateral group (more than 5%) consisted of Cataract ( higher in 2q8), Punctate keratitis (HDq16 only), Retinal 
pigment epithelial tear (higher in HDq12), subretinal fluid (higher in HDq12), Vitreous floaters (higher in 2q8) 
and IOP increased (higher in HDq12).

For non-ocular TEAEs the most reported SOC (more than 10%) in bilateral group consisted of Vascular disorders 
(10.9%  in  all  HD  group  vs  5.0%),  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  injury  poisoning  and 
procedural complication (10% vs 4.0% in HDq12) and Infection and Infestations.

Serious ocular TEAE in bilateral were slightly higher in HDq12 group between groups and compared to unilateral 
(3.3% vs 1.5%) while proportions for serious non-ocular TEAE were comparable. Higher proportions of ocular 
TEAE related to study drug were reported in 2q8 (1.6% vs 6.4%) and HDq12 (5.5% vs 8.3%) and one non-
ocular  study  drug  related  TEAE  was  reported  in  2q8.  AESI  (Cataract,  Hypertension,  IOP,  non-ocular 
haemorrhage, APCT) were reported in slightly higher proportion in bilateral therapy for HD group. Other events 
such as IOI, retinal tear/detachment, nasal mucosal events were reported in low and comparable proportions 
(all event occurred in one patient).  
In PHOTON, more than half of the patients received bilateral treatment (either aflibercept HD or 2q8 in the 
study eye and aflibercept 2q8 in the fellow eye) in PHOTON (61.7% in the 2q8 group; 61.0% in HDq12 and 
62.0% in HDq16 at week 48). The population who received bilateral therapy consisted of patients with a higher 
proportion of female in the HDq16 group compared to unilateral 42.6% vs 33.9%), aged below 65 years old, 
a higher Hemoglobin A1c > 8% (Pooled HD group: 41.7% vs 32.8%),  baseline DRSS ≥ 53 (Pooled HD group: 
25.2% vs. 11.6%) , higher medical history of cataract in HDq12 (37.3% vs 29.9%) and 2q8 (39.8% vs 23.4%) 
for bilateral therapy but well balanced between groups. Regarding non-ocular medical history, proportions were 
comparable  between  unilateral  and  bilateral  treated  population  or  lower  for  the  bilateral  in  SOC  Cardiac 
disorders (19.2% vs 23.8%) and Vascular disorders (76.8% vs 82.0% in all HD group).  
Ocular TEAEs were slightly more reported in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups (33.8% and 30.7% respectively) 
compared  to  the  unilaterally  treated  population  and  the  bilaterally  treated  2q8  group.  PT  of  “Conjunctival 
haemorrhage” in 2q8 and HDq16 groups and “Diabetic retinal oedema” and “Vitreous floaters” in the HDq12 
group were reported in higher incidence in the bilaterally treated population. Furthermore, PT reported in ≥5% 
of the patients receiving bilateral treatment were “Cataract” (HDq16 group), “Conjunctival haemorrhage” (2q8 
and HDq16 group), “Punctate keratitis” (HDq16 group) and “Vitreous floaters” (HDq12 group).

Non ocular TEAEs in the HD group treated bilaterally were reported in comparable proportions (54.0% vs 56.1% 
in all HD group). Incidence were slightly lower in the all HD bilateral group regarding the SOC Cardiac disorders 
(4.6%  vs  6.9%)  and  for  the  HDq12  group  (4.0%  vs  8.7%)  but  incidence  was  slightly  higher  in  the  HDq16 
bilateral group (5.9% vs 3.2%). In the SOC Vascular disorders, incidences were lower in the all HD bilateral 
group (11.6% vs 13.9%) and the HDq16 group (9.9% vs 22.6%) and higher for the 2q8 and HDq12 group 
(14.6% vs 6.3% and 12.4% vs 9.4% respectively). Regarding the PT “Hypertension”, differences were observed 
in  the  2q8  group  and  HDq12  group  with  higher  incidence  for  the  bilateral  population  (12.6%  vs  4.7%  and 
10.9% vs 3.9%). For the SOC Nervous system disorders, differences were observed with higher incidence in 
the 2q8 group and HDq16 group bilaterally treated (11.7% vs 4.7% and 11.9 vs 6.5% respectively). Serious 
ocular  TEAE  in  bilateral  treatment  arms  were  low  and  comparable  (none  in  the  HDq16  group).  Non  ocular 
serious TEAE were higher in 2q8 in bilateral (19.4% vs 9.4%)  but in comparable  proportions for HD group. 
Study drug related TEAE (ocular and non-ocular) were reported with low incidence in the bilateral HD group.  
One study drug related non ocular related (Lacunar infarction) was reported in HDq16. AESI such as Cataract, 
IOP, APTC events and Hypertension were reported in slightly higher incidence in HDq12 group in bilateral. No

In  particular,  results  for  nAMD  bilaterally  treated  population  (PULSAR)  must  be  interpreted  with  caution 
considering the low group size compared to DME treated population (PHOTON).  
The Applicant also provide data from PK simulation bilateral treatment 8 mg + 2 mg which simulate the worst-
case scenario (bilateral 8+2 mg IVT aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (q4) through 56 weeks) although 
it may not represent bilateral exposure in PULSAR and PHOTON. The simulation shows accumulation of free 
aflibercept in plasma after three initial monthly dose (AUC 2.60 mg*day/L for nAMD and 2.89 mg*day/L for 
DME)  and  with  no  further  dose  accumulation  beyond  week  8-12.  Additionally,  free  aflibercept  being  slowly 
absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after IVT administration, no increase in blood pressure is 
expected.  However,  as  discussed  in  the  Pharmacokinetic  section  it  is  to  be  noted  that  the  model  tends  to 
overpredictive and may in particular lead to imprecisions in estimation of free aflibercept. 
Additionally, data on bilateral therapy with 8 mg are missing. In general practice, the Applicant explain that 
the most expected regimen of administration while be bilateral exposure with initial treatment and maintenance 
schedule which consist of 3 initial monthly injection in the active eye followed by a maintenance dose of 12 
weeks after the last monthly injection and in the fellow eye (already treated eye) of a maintenance dose with 
HD  aflibercept  every  12  weeks.  This  is  justified  by  the  Applicant  that  the  clinical  presentation  with  bilateral 
newly diagnosed CI-DME or nAMD is relatively uncommon (Mathenge 2014, Adrian et al. 2022, Dhoot et al. 
2023).

2.5.7.6.3.  Exposure during pregnancy and lactation 
Regarding  use  in  pregnancy  and  lactation,  in  non-clinical  trials,  the  absence  of  safety  margin  with  this  new 
formulation in animal study (see non clinical assessment) was observed and available clinical safety data with 
aflibercept, which are limited, concluded with a potential signal of spontaneous abortion/pregnancy loss that 
needs 
to 
be 
followed 
carefully. 
According 
to 
the 
procedure 
PSUSA 
of 
aflibercept 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010020/202211) which is ongoing, the labelling of paragraph “breastfeeding” in section 
4. was updated in line with the EMA conclusions. 
2.5.7.7.  Immunological events 
ADA analysis set and NAb analysis set consisted of n=793 (ADA) and n=786 (NAb) for nAMD (PULSAR study) 
and 541 (ADA) and 541 (NAb) for DME (PHOTON). In both nAMD and DME indication, more than 90% of the 
patients were ADA negative and low proportions of patients had pre-existing immunogenicity. No treatment-
boosted ADA was observed, and all treatment-emergent responses were low titer (< 1000). Furthermore, no 
relevant impact of treatment-emergent ADAs on the safety profile were observed. 
2.5.7.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies were conducted with HD aflibercept. 
2.5.7.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  PULSAR,  the  proportions  of  ocular  and  non-ocular  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  were  low  and  similar 
between treatment groups at week 48 and 60 and in HD group solely “Retinal haemorrhage” occurred in more 
than one patient. One serious event of “Retinal detachment” was recorded at week 48 but not at week 60, the 
MAH was requested to explain the difference (see OC in Clinical AR). 
In PHOTON, two ocular events lead to study discontinuation, Iritis (moderate in severity, study drug related) 
and  Visual  impairment  (moderate  in  severity),  both  in  the  HDq12  group.  Non  ocular  TEAE  leading  to  study 
discontinuation  were  reported  in  similar  proportion  between  2q8  group  and  all  HD  group.  Most  events  were 
reported in single participants. 
Up to week 96, in PULSAR and PHOTON, 68.1% (n=689) and 80.9% (n=534) respectively of the randomized 
patients (n=1009) completed Week 96. The main reasons of withdrawal in both studies were due to withdrawal 
of consent by the patient (5.1% in PULSAR and 5.2% in PHOTON) and proportions were comparable between 
arm regarding reasons for not completing the study. 
2.5.7.10.  Post marketing experience 
No  post-marketing  data  are  available  for  HD  aflibercept.  Most  recent  post-marketing  data  on  the  approved 
aflibercept 2 mg is available in the latest version of the PSUSA/00010020/202211.

2.5.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This submission for aflibercept HD 8 mg (114.3 mg/mL) summarize the 48 week and 60 week safety data for 
two phase 3 studies PULSAR (nAMD) and PHOTON (DME) as well as 44 week safety data for the phase 2 study 
CANDELA  (nAMD).  The  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  aflibercept  8  mg  (70µL  of  114.3 
mg/mL), every 12 or 16 weeks compared to aflibercept 2 mg (50 µL of 40 mg/mL), every 8 weeks. The safety 
analysis set consisted of 1009 patients in PULSAR and 106 patients in CANDELA for nAMD indication and 658 
patients in PHOTON for DME indication. More than 90% of the patients in both nAMD and DME studies completed 
up  to  week  60  for  PHOTON  and  PULSAR  (both  ongoing)  and  up  to  week  44  for  CANDELA  (completed).  The 
Applicant also provided as requested in the LoQ efficacy and safety data up to 96 weeks all patients in PHOTON 
and approximately 80% in PULSAR.  
In PULSAR, at week 60, patients received in 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 respectively 8.5, 6.9 and 6.0 injections. 
In CANDELA, the mean number of injections at week 16 in both group (all HD and IAI) was of 5.8. Overall, in 
PULSAR the mean total amount of aflibercept injected into the study eye up to week 60 was three times higher 
in the HD group. In PHOTON, up to week 60 patients received in 2q8, HDq12 and HDq16 respectively 10.0, 7.0 
and 6.0 injections. Up to week 96, the mean number of injections were respectively in the 2q8, HDq12 and 
HDq16 treatment groups 12.8, 9.8 and 8.2 for PULSAR and 13.8, 9.5 and 7.8 for PHOTON. 
The dosing regimen for HD group in PULSAR and PHOTON was of respectively 3 monthly injections followed by 
a maintenance phase with 12 or 16 weeks intervals. Considering the higher exposure, the Applicant provided 
further discussion on the efficacy and on the safety profile of the HDq12 and HDq16 groups in the initiation 
phase for PULSAR and PHOTON phase in which all treatment arms received active monthly injection with either 
2 mg or 8 mg aflibercept at day 1, week 4 and week 8.  Although exposures to aflibercept in the HD treatment 
arms  in  both  PULSAR  and  PHOTON  studies  were  higher  during  the  loading  phase  and  that  the  incidence  of 
ocular TEAE in the 2q8 arms in both groups were disparate, safety data are still reassuring and in favour of a 
comparable  safety  profile  with  ocular  and  non-ocular  TEAE  being  reported  in  similar  range  between  both 
studies. No consistent trend could be observed in both studies. In both phase 3 studies, patients in HDq12 and 
HDq16  were  eligible  for  dose  interval  shortening  (to  a  minimum  of  HDq8)  starting  from  week  12  or  16  or 
extension  (by  4-week  increments:  HDq20)  starting  from  week  52.  This  is  further  discussed  in  the  Efficacy 
section. The majority of the patients more than >75% in PULSAR and more than 90% in PHOTON maintained 
their dosing regimen. In PULSAR, less than 10% of the HDq12 participants shortened to HDq8 and 38.5% of 
the patients in HDq16 extended to HDq20 at week 60. In PHOTON, a total of 34.2% in HDq16 extended to 
HDq20 and 14.5% shortened to HDq12 or HDq8. In the fellow eye, slightly less patients received treatment in 
HD group (18.5% vs 20.2 % at week 60) in PULSAR while similar proportions were observed between groups 
in CANDELA and PHOTON.  
As the patient with an HDq20 interval regimen are less exposed, no worsening of the safety profile is expected. 
Safety  data  for  HDq8  were  submitted  and  compared  to  not  modified  HDq12/Hdq16  and  2q8.  No  consistent 
trend could be observed for higher reported ocular and non-ocular TEAE and the safety profile seems similar 
to the known safety profile of aflibercept 2 mg. In PHOTON in particular, lower ocular TEAE rates were reported.  
Up to week 96, the majority of the patient had a treatment interval of ≥ 12 weeks (all HD 87.1% PULSAR and 
92.9% in PHOTON ) and ≥ 16 weeks (all HD 69.2% PULSAR and 72.4% in PHOTON) and more than 40% of 
the  patient  in  both  studies  had  extended  to  q20  (46.6%  in  PULSAR  and  44.8%  in  PHOTON).  Proportion  of

patient shortened to HDq8 were higher for PULSAR (21.3% in all HD group) compared to PHOTON (10.6% in 
all  HD  group)  and  with  a  similar  trend  for  proportions  of  patients  in  HDq8  regimen  which  were  low  in  both 
studies and higher in nAMD population (13.1% in PULSAR and 7.3% in PHOTON). 
Regarding demographic characteristic and medical history in nAMD and DME, differences could be observed in 
both populations between HD group and 2q8. This is further discussed in Efficacy section. Overall, the Applicant 
was  requested  to  further  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  differences  regarding  demographic 
characteristics and reported medical history for nAMD and DME population in Efficacy section. 
In both AMD and DME studies, prior and concomitant treatments were reported in similar proportions and the 
most reported ATC in both indications were consistent with medical history.  
Overview of TEAE 
•  nAMD 
For nAMD, comparable proportion for ocular and non-ocular TEAE were observed in PULSAR up to week 48 and 
60.  The  most  reported  ocular  TEAEs  for  the  study  eye  consisted  of  “Visual  acuity  reduced”,  “Cataract”,  and 
“Retinal haemorrhage” which are very common/common listed ADR of Eylea 2 mg. Ocular TEAEs were for the 
majority mild or moderate. Severe TEAE were reported in low and similar proportions with retinal detachment, 
solely, being reported in more than one patient. Reported ocular TEAEs are consistent with the known safety 
profile  of  aflibercept  (2mg),  slight  differences  can  be  observed  between  all  HD  and  2q8  groups  (for  the  PT 
nAMD) but also between HDq16 and HDq12 (for the PT Visual acuity reduced, Vitreous detachment, Vitreous 
floaters and Macular oedema) however incidences in the HDq12 arm were comparable to 2q8 or lowest although 
exposure  is  the  highest  and  observed  incidences  remains  below  or  in  the  same  range  as  compared  to  the 
frequency listed for EYLEA 2 mg. Up to week 96, similar tendencies could be observed for ocular TEAE with 
slightly  lower  incidence  in  the  HD  group  (53.6%  in  2q8  vs  50.5§  in  all  HD).  Most  reported  ocular  PT  were 
consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  aflibercept  and  incidences  were  comparable  except  for  cataract 
(listed  ADR  and  important  identified  safety  concern  for  aflibercept)  however  this  could  be  explained  by  the 
reported medical history of cataract being higher in the HD group and comparable proportions were reported 
when looking at all PT related to cataract.  
Regarding non-ocular TEAE in PULSAR at week 48 and 60, more than half of the patient in all group reported 
at  least  one  non-ocular  TEAE.  The  most  reported  PT  were  “Infection  and  Infestations”,  “Gastrointestinal 
disorders”,  “Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissues  disorders”  and  “Vascular  disorders”  (Hypertension  being 
more reported in HDq12). Incidences between PT were overall comparable although slight differences could be 
observed. Non-ocular TEAE were mostly mild to moderate in severity and severe non-ocular TEAE were more 
reported in the 2q8 group. Lower incidences were reported in the HDq12 arm in which exposure is the highest 
which does not seem in favour of a dose related effect. Additionally, these differences could be explained by 
the higher incidences of medical history of hypertension and psychiatric disorders. When looking per TEAE (SOC 
gastrointestinal disorders), events were low or reported in single patients. Up to week 96, similar tendencies 
could be observed.  
Up to week 48 and week 60, comparable proportions for study drug-related TEAE, IVT injection-procedure and 
protocol-required procedure were reported between 2q8 and all HD groups. However, ocular study drug related 
TEAE in study eye were reported in slightly higher incidence in HDq12. Incidence of ocular study drug related 
TEAEs (PT) in the study eye in all HD group were low (<1% at week 60) and consisted of Visual Acuity reduced, 
IOP  increased  and  Retinal  pigment  epithelial  tear  (all  reported  in  more  than  one  patient).  Non-ocular  study 
Assessment report

drug  related  TEAE  were  reported  in  similar  proportions  between  groups  and  PT  reported  in  more  than  one 
patient was “Cerebrovascular accident” for non-ocular TEAE (in 2q8 group). Incidences of ocular TEAE related 
to  IVT  procedure  were  slightly  higher  in  2q8  group  and  differences  could  be  observed  between  HDq12  and 
HDq16. However, incidences in HDq12 (highest exposure) were lower or comparable to observed incidences in 
2q8. The majority of the events were reported in single patients. The most reported PT for ocular TEAE assessed 
as related to IVT were “Conjunctival haemorrhage”, “Vitreous floaters» and “Sensation of foreign body”. Non-
ocular TEAE assessed as related to IVT injection were reported in the HD group only (in solely one patient in 
each HD group) and consisted of chest pain, cerebral ischemia, head discomfort, headache, trigeminal neuralgia 
and hypertension. The Applicant provided the narratives of the cases and all event were majorly non serious, 
resolved,  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity  and  with  no  drug  change.  Ocular  and  non-ocular  TEAE  assessed  as 
protocol-specified  procedure  related  were  low  (less  than  1%)  and  comparable  between  groups.  The  most 
reported PT consisted of “Corneal abrasion” for ocular TEAE and “Nausea” and “Vomiting” for non-ocular TEAE. 
Up to week 96, similar tendencies could be observed.  
The proportion of patients presenting serious TEAE were low in rate and slightly higher in the 2q8 than in the 
HD group and similar tendencies were observed up to week 96 (2.8% in all HD group vs 1.2% in 2q8 group). 
Proportions of TEAE leading to study discontinuation were similar and low between groups. Ocular serious TEAE 
were reported in low proportions (<2%) with a slightly higher frequency in the HD group at both week 48 and 
60. Reported ocular SAE at week 48 and 60 occurring in n≥2 were “Retinal haemorrhage” (in both HD groups) 
and  “IOP  increased”  (in  HDq12).  The  majority  of  serious  ocular  TEAE  in  the  study  eye  were  moderate  in 
intensity. Ocular serious TEAE assessed as drug study related at week 60 was “Angle closure glaucoma” (1 in 
HDq16). Ocular serious TEAEs assessed as IVT injection procedure related in HD group were “Angle closure 
glaucoma”, “Skin laceration” and “IOP increased”. Non-ocular serious TEAE were observed in similar proportions 
with  comparable  frequency  between  groups  for  each  reported  SOCs  at  week  48  and  60.  Non-ocular  serious 
TEAE assessed as drug related occurred in 6 patients (2 in HDq16 and 4 in 2q8). The most reported serious 
TEAE assessed as study related was “Cerebrovascular accident” (n=2) observed in 2q8. Additionally, one event 
of “Chest pain” in HDq12 was attributed to anxiety and assessed as injection and procedure related and resolved 
on the same day. The majority of serious non-ocular TEAE were moderate in severity. The proportions of ocular 
and non-ocular TEAE leading to discontinuation were low and similar between treatment groups at week 48 
and 60 and in HD group solely “Retinal haemorrhage” occurred in more than one patient. Most reported serious 
non-ocular PT were consistent with underlying conditions and no similar trends were seen between both studies.  
Regarding AESI (IOI, IOP, retinal tear/detachment, hypersensitivity, ATE, VTE, non-ocular haemorrhage, nasal 
mucosal  findings),  these  events  were  reported  in  comparable  proportions  between  treatment  arms  and  no 
concern were raised from the analysis of the submitted data compared to the known profile for Eylea 2 mg. 
Higher incidence of Cataract were observed up to week 96 (9.1% in all HD group vs 6.5% 2q8 for PULSAR). 
Cataract is listed in the SmPc of Eylea 2 mg (common: 8%) and Eylea 8 mg (common: 4%) and is an important 
identified safety concern in the RMP of Eylea. Up to week 96, no cases of Endophthalmitis, ocular vasculitis and 
occlusive retinitis were reported for all HD group and for retinal pigment epithelial tear which was more reported 
in the HDq12 group (all events occurred in the initiation phase) the reported rate of 1.8% is in line with the 
pooled  incidence  found  in  previous  studies  in  AMD  (VIEW  1/VIEW  2)  which  was  1.6%.  At  week  96,  for  ATE 
events, incidences were low and similar proportions were reported in both studies (ATEs 4.8% 2q8 and 5.3% 
all HD group for PULSAR). 
In  PULSAR,  less  than  20%  of  the  patient  received  bilateral  treatment  in  the  pooled  HD  group.  Participants 
receiving  bilateral  treatment  in  HD  group  had  slightly  higher  proportion  of  medical  history  hypertension, 
CVA/stroke,  renal  impairment  vitreous  detachment,  cataract  operation,  nervous  system  disorders  and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Non-ocular TEAEs were reported in higher proportion for the 
HD group. The most reported SOC (more than 10%) in bilateral group consisted of Vascular disorders (10.9% 
in  all  HD  group  vs  5.0%),  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  injury  poisoning  and  procedural 
Assessment report

complication (10% vs 4.0% in HDq12) and Infection and Infestations. Serious ocular TEAE in bilateral were 
slightly higher in HDq12 group between groups and compared to unilateral. AESI (Cataract, Hypertension, IOP, 
non-ocular haemorrhage, APCT) were reported in slightly higher proportion in bilateral therapy for HD group. 
These results must be interpreted with caution considering the low group size.  
•  DME 
At week 48 and 60, TEAE in PHOTON were more reported in HD group (60.9% in all HD group vs 57.5% in 2q8 
at  week  60)  as  ocular  TEAE  in  study  eye  and  non–ocular  TEAE  were  more  reported  in  HD  group.  Similar 
tendencies  were  observed  at  week  96.  The  most  reported  PT  for  ocular  TEAE  in  the  study  eye  were  IOP 
increased,  Conjunctival  haemorrhage,  vitreous  floaters,  retinal  haemorrhage,  and  Cataract  (all  three  more 
reported in HDq16 or HDq12 groups) all known and listed ADR of Eylea 2 mg. Comparable proportions were 
observed between the 2q8 and HDq12 arms, comparable or higher proportion were reported in the fellow eye. 
Ocular TEAE in the study eye were for the majority mild in severity and with a higher incidence in the HDq16 
group.  Reported  ocular  TEAEs  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  aflibercept  and  underlying 
conditions. The most reported non-ocular TEAE (more than 10%) were the SOC Infections and infestations, 
Vascular disorders (slightly more reported in HDq16), Gastrointestinal disorders and Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders. Events were either reported majorly in single patients or could be due to a higher medical history 
for these SOCs being reported in HDq16 arm Non-ocular TEAE were for the majority mild (higher incidence in 
HDq16) or moderate in severity.  
Study drug related TEAE were ocular TEAE for the majority and reported in less than 2% of the patients and 
proportions were similar between all HD group and 2q8 group. The only TEAE reported in more than one patient 
up to week 48 and 60 was IOP increase and one non-ocular study drug related ‘Lacunar infarction” was reported 
in HDq16 group (bilateral treatment, resolved, no recurrence observed). IVT injection related TEAE were ocular 
TEAE and protocol procedure related TEAE (none in HDq16) were non-ocular TEAE for the majority and reported 
in comparable proportion between HDq12 and 2q8 groups. Ocular IVT-injection-related TEAEs were reported 
in  more  than  2  patients  in  all  groups  for  Conjunctival  haemorrhage,  Eye  pain,  IOP  increased  and  Vitreous 
floaters. Non-ocular IVT-injection-related TEAEs in the HD group only (3 patients 0.6% in all HD group at week 
60)  and  consisted  of  Nausea,  Vomiting  and  Headache.  Ocular  TEAEs  related  to  other  protocol-specified 
procedures  in  the  study  eye  were  reported  in  low  proportions  and  in  the  HDq12  group  only  (Conjunctival 
haemorrhage  and  Injection  site  irritation).  Non-ocular  TEAEs  related  to  other  protocol-specified  procedures 
were reported in low proportions included Nausea, Vessel puncture site haematoma, Contrast media allergy, 
Post procedural pruritus, Rash, and Vein rupture. Up to week 96, similar tendencies could be observed.  
Serious TEAE were slightly higher in 2q8 group. Serious ocular TEAE were for the majority mild to moderate in 
severity while serious non-ocular TEAE were for the majority moderate to severe. Serious ocular TEAE consisted 
in HD group of Cataract subcapsular, IOP increased, Retinal detachment and vitreous haemorrhage. All were 
moderate or severe in severity, resolved and one event IOP increased was assessed as IVT injection related. 
Up to week 96, serious ocular TEAE were low in rate and proportions were similar in PHOTON (1.2%). In both 
PHOTON and PULSAR, most serious TEAE were reported in single patients (except for cataract (n=2 HDq16), 
retinal detachment (n=5 all HD group), retinal hemorrhage (n=4 all HD group) and IOP increase (n=2 HDq12) 
for PULSAR and vitreous detachment (n=2 HDq16) for PHOTON)). 
Serious non-ocular TEAE were slightly less reported in the HDq16 group compared to other treatment arms. 
Serious non-ocular TEAEs were primarily reported in the SOC of Cardiac disorders with comparable incidence 
between  groups  at  week  60.  The  SOC  Nervous  system  disorders  were  reported  in  higher  proportion  in  the 
HDq16  group  (3.7%)  and  the  PT  Cerebrovascular  accident  was  reported  with  higher  incidence  in  HDq16  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023

which none were assessed as drug related and incidences in the HDq12 arm and 2q8 arm were similar. Up to 
week 96, lower proportions were observed in PHOTON (2q8: 25.1, all HD: 23.2%) with PT majorly reported in 
single patients. Most reported serious non-ocular PT were consistent with underlying conditions and no similar 
trends were seen between both studies.  
TEAE leading to discontinuation were more reported in the HDq12 group and consisted for the majority of non-
ocular TEAE (all reported in single participants in similar proportion between groups). Two events, one case of 
Iritis (study drug related) and Visual impairment, both moderate in severity. A total of 18 deaths occurred in 
PHOTON up to week 60. All deaths were associated to an SAE and none were considered as related to study 
drug or study procedure. The most reported SOC was Cardiac disorders (3 deaths in each group at week 60). 
The cause of death was unknown for 2 patients in HDq12 group and for one patient in HDq12 (patients had 
cardiovascular risk factors and the chronology was not in favour of a causality). Up to week 96, incidences of 
deaths were lower in the HD group (4.7% vs 5.4% 2q8 in PHOTON). 
AESI (IOI, IOP increased, hypersensitivity, VTE) were reported in comparable proportion between treatment 
arms and no safety concerns overall were raised from the submitted data. Other events such as Cataract were 
reported in higher incidence in HDq16. Similar tendencies were observed up to week 96, incidence of cataract 
was 7.5% in all HD vs 3.6% for 2q8 for PHOTON. Higher proportions of TEAE were also seen for subtypes of 
cataract (cataract cortical, cataract nuclear and cataract subcapsular) but when looking at pooled data slightly 
lower or comparable proportions were reported between all HD and 2q8 groups (frequency uncommon for all 
in SmPc Eylea 8 mg). Cataract is listed in the SmPc of Eylea 2 mg (common: 8%) and Eylea 8 mg (common: 
4%)  and  is  an  important  identified  safety  concern  in  the  RMP  of  Eylea.  Up  to  week  96,  no  cases  of 
Endophthalmitis, ocular vasculitis and occlusive retinitis were reported for all HD group in PHOTON and overall 
incidence of IOI events are low and comparable between arms.  Concerning IOP increase although comparable 
proportions were reported between all HD and 2q8, pre-dose IOP (≥25 mmHg and ≥10 mmHg) were reported 
in higher incidence in HD group no relevant clinical differences could be observed regarding mean change in 
pre-injection IOP. IOP incidence was highest in the 2q8 arm in which there was the lowest aflibercept exposure 
in the compared to HDq12 and HDq16. For APTC and ATE events, while incidences were low, higher proportions 
were reported in HDq16 group. Although ATE events were more reported in the HDq16 group and 2q8 group 
than in the HDq12 group (6.7% vs 6.0% vs 3.4% respectively), the cumulative exposure was the highest in 
the HDq12 which showed the lowest incidence.  
More  than  half  of  the  patients  received  bilateral  treatment  in  PHOTON  (61.7%  in  the  2q8  group;  61.0%  in 
HDq12 and 62.0% in HDq16 at week 48). The population who received bilateral therapy consisted of patients 
with  a  higher  proportion  of  female  in  the  HDq16  group  compared  to  unilateral,  aged  below  65  years  old,  a 
higher Haemoglobin A1c > 8%, baseline DRSS ≥ 53, higher medical history of cataract in HDq12 for bilateral 
therapy but well balanced between groups. Regarding non-ocular medical history, proportions were comparable 
between  unilateral  and  bilateral  treated  population  or  lower  for  the  SOC  Cardiac  disorders  and  Vascular 
disorders. Ocular TEAEs were reported in higher incidence in HD group. Most reported PT (≥5%) in HD bilateral 
arms consisted of Cataract, Conjunctival haemorrhage, Punctate keratitis and vitreous floaters (all higher in 
HD  group).  Non  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  HD  group  treated  bilaterally  were  reported  in  comparable  proportions. 
Slight  differences  could  be  observed  for  the  SOC  Cardiac  disorders,  Vascular  disorders  and  Nervous  system 
disorders. Serious ocular TEAE in bilateral treatment arms were low and comparable (none in the HDq16 group). 
Serious non-ocular TEAE were more reported in 2q8 group. Study drug related TEAE (ocular and non-ocular) 
were reported with low incidence in the bilateral HD group.  One study drug related non ocular related (Lacunar 
infarction) was reported in HDq16. AESI such as Cataract, IOP, APTC events and Hypertension were reported 
in slightly higher incidence in HDq12 group in bilateral. No cases of injection related cataract were reported. A 
difference  can  be  observed  for  ATE  between  HDq12  and  HDq16.  The  Applicant  also  provide  data  from  PK 
simulation  bilateral  treatment  8  mg  +  2  mg  which  simulate  the  worst-case  scenario  (bilateral  8+2  mg  IVT 
aflibercept  administered  every  4  weeks  (q4)  through  56  weeks)  although  it  may  not  represent  bilateral 
exposure in PULSAR and PHOTON. The simulation shows accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma after three

initial  monthly  dose  (AUC  2.60  mg*day/L  for  nAMD  and  2.89  mg*day/L  for  DME)  and  with  no  further  dose 
accumulation  beyond  week  8-12.  Additionally,  free  aflibercept  being  slowly  absorbed  from  the  eye  into  the 
systemic circulation after IVT administration, no increase in blood pressure is expected. However, as discussed 
in the Pharmacokinetic section it is to be noted that the model tends to overpredictive and may in particular 
lead to imprecisions in estimation of free aflibercept. In general practice, the Applicant explain that the most 
expected regimen of administration while be bilateral exposure with initial treatment and maintenance schedule 
which consist of 3 initial monthly injection in the active eye followed by a maintenance dose of 12 weeks after 
the last monthly injection and in the fellow eye (already treated eye) of a maintenance dose with HD aflibercept 
every 12 weeks. This is justified by the Applicant that the clinical presentation with bilateral newly diagnosed 
CI-DME or nAMD is relatively uncommon (Mathenge 2014, Adrian et al. 2022, Dhoot et al. 2023). The Applicant 
will assess the safety profile associated to bilateral exposure with aflibercept 114.3 mg/ml through the PSUR.  
Additionally, the Applicant proposed to conduct a Phase 4 PK study to assess exposure with bilateral treatment 
with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml as a REC (recommendation) for which results will thus be submitted by the Applicant 
as a PAM (post-authorization measure) or as a type II variation if appropriate. Depending on the results of the 
study, the Applicant committed to evaluate the need for a post-approval study. 
Hypertension 
As hypertension is a listed event for aflibercept administered by IV (although at a much higher posology), that 
the topic is actually followed through the PSUR and a difference could be observed up to week 60, the Applicant 
further discussed on the topic of Hypertension with the newly proposed regimen. Proportion of patients with 
medical  history  of  hypertension  was  similar  with  and  without  hypertension  event  although  higher  blood 
pressures at baseline were higher in HD group (PULSAR: 141 mmHg (SBP)/77.3 mmHg (DBP) vs 133.3 mmHg 
(SBP)/76.4 mmHg (DBP)). In PULSAR, the lowest incidence (15,5%) was reported in HDq12 group in which 
the exposure is the highest. Onset of hypertension TEAEs over time (up to week 60) were well distributed and 
is  not  in  favour  of  a  correlated  aflibercept  induced  hypertension.  Pooled  mean  changes  in  blood  pressure 
(CANDELA/PULSAR/PHOTON) for 8 mg were lower than the baseline through week 60. Pre-defined treatment-
emergent potentially clinically significant values of systolic blood pressure related to elevations and decrease 
were  comparable  or  slightly  higher  in  all  HD  group  for  both  PULSAR  and  PHOTON.  Compared  to  previous 
experience with Eylea 2 mg, similar or higher incidence were  observed at 1 and 2 years in the 2 mg group 
compared to week 60 and 96 with 8 mg (for DME 25.8 % 2 mg at 2 years vs 17.3% at week 96 for all HD and 
for AMD 14.7% 2 mg at 2 years vs 8.0% at week 96 for all HD).  At week 96, incidences were similar in PULSAR 
(2q8: 7.4%, all HD 8.0%) and PHOTON (2q8: 16.2%, all HD 15.5%). Furthermore, the risk of hypertension is 
currently monitored through the PSUR.  
Subgroup analysis 
For PULSAR and PHOTON, at week 48 and 60, differences could be observed for ocular adverse events and 
non-ocular TEAE with higher proportions for HDq12 by categories of age and for the Japan subgroups (10% in 
PULSAR and 20% in PHOTON of included patients were Asian). However, taking into account the low number 
of participants included in the subgroups, these results should be interpreted with caution. For other analysed 
subgroups, no safety concerns can be raised regarding the submitted data for both studies.   
Immunogenicity 
In both nAMD and DME studies, the majority of the patient were ADA negative, No treatment-boosted ADA was 
observed, and all treatment-emergent responses were low titer (< 1000). No relevant impact of treatment-
emergent ADAs on the safety profile were observed.

In non-clinical trials, the absence of safety margin with this new formulation in animal study (see non clinical 
assessment  and  available  clinical  safety  data  with  aflibercept,  which  are  limited,  concluded  with  a  potential 
signal  of  spontaneous  abortion/pregnancy  loss  that  needs  to  be  followed  carefully.  The  Applicant  provided 
further discussion on recommendation level in pregnancy which is acknowledged.  
According to the procedure PSUSA of aflibercept (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010020/202211) which is ongoing, the 
labelling  of  paragraph  “breastfeeding”  in  section  4.6  was  updated  by  the  Applicant  in  line  with  the  EMA 
conclusions. 
2.5.9.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In  this  submission,  the  Applicant  provided  data  up  to  60  week  for  a  new  posology  Aflibercept  8  mg  in  vial 
(114.3 mg/mL), which is 3 times higher than the marketed 2 mg (40 m/mL). The overall submitted data for 
the safety profile for Aflibercept 8 mg up to week 96 seems (see LoI) to be in line with the already known and 
established safety profile of Eylea. Some differences could be observed regarding ocular and non-ocular TEAEs 
in PULSAR and PHOTON which were discussed by the Applicant and no new safety concerns can be raised at 
this stage.  
2.6.  Risk Management Plan

2.6.1.1.  Discussion on safety specification 
The Applicant proposed the list of safety concerns presented above. In PULSAR (AMD) and PHOTON (DME), 
patients were treated in the fellow eye with Aflibercept 2 mg or another anti-VEGF, thus no data are actually 
available regarding bilateral treatment with 8 mg. The proposal of the addition of the safety concern “Exposure 
with bilateral 8 mg aflibercept therapy” as missing information is acceptable.  
For the safety concern “Medication errors”, the Applicant proposed a mock-up for the packaging of Eylea 8 mg 
to  differentiate  the  two  posology.  The  disparities  between  the  two  posology  will  also  be  highlighted  in  the 
Educational material and in the SmPC (section 4.2 and 6.6). All the proposed changes to minimize the risk of 
medication error by the Applicant are accepted.  
For the safety concern ‘off-label use and misuse”, the risk of off-label use of Eylea 8mg in the other approved 
indication of Eylea (2 mg) is expected to be low in both the adult and paediatric population (in particular as the 
paediatric device is specific to the 2 mg PFS and that no data were published in this indication according to the 
Applicant). The safety concern is addressed in the Educational material. 
No concerns are raised regarding the other safety concerns of Eylea. 
2.6.1.2.  Conclusions on the safety specification  
At this stage, having considered the data in the safety specification it is agreed that the safety concerns listed 
by the applicant are appropriate. 
2.6.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
•  Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities  
Routine  pharmacovigilance  activities 
include 
two 
specific 
follow-up  questionnaires  one 
for 
endophthalmitis/intraocular  inflammation,  and  one  concerning  IOP  increases  with  the  2  mg  Eylea  PFS.  The 
questionnaire for Endophthalmitis/Intraocular inflammation was updated to include the 8 mg dosage for wet 
AMD/DME indications (Annex 4). Furthermore, as the Eylea 8 mg 114.3 mg/ml) is available in vial only, the 
questionnaire specific to IOP increase with the PFS was not updated. This is acceptable.  
•  Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities  
The Applicant initially proposed a category 3 phase 4 PK study (An open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, 
Phase 4 Pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate the systemic exposure of bilateral intravitreal administration 
of high dose (HD) (8 mg) aflibercept in adults with diabetic macular edema (DME) or neovascular age-related 
macular  degeneration  (nAMD))  as  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  to  assess  the  safety  concern 
“Exposure  with  bilateral  treatment  of  Eylea  114.3  mg/ml".  However.  the  proposed  PK  study  sample  size  is 
expected  to  provide  limited  information  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  HD  use  in  patients.  The  proposed 
study will be able to inform on the PK profile of aflibercept solution 114.3 mg/mL, which could impact on safety 
in case of bilateral treatment as reflected in the latest proposed section 4.4 of the SmPC: 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 220/235 
 
 
 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  bilateral  treatment  with  Eylea  114.3  mg/ml  per  eye  have  not  been  studied  (see 
section  5.1).  If  bilateral  treatment  is  performed  at  the  same  time  this  could  lead  to  an  increased  systemic 
exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse events. 
Thus, the proposed PK study was downgraded as a REC (recommendation) for which results will be submitted 
by the Applicant as a PAM (post-authorization measure) or as a type II variation if appropriate. Depending on 
the results of the study, the Applicant committed to evaluate the need for a post-approval study. 
Overall, the safety associated with the bilateral administration with the 8 mg dosage will be monitored by the 
Applicant in the PSUR with a particular focus on systemic adverse effects.  
In conclusion, there are no new additional pharmacovigilance activities and the ongoing or planned additional 
PV activities remains as follow:  
• 
•  Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The PRAC having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV 
development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

2.6.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
•  Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
•  Summary of additional risk minimisation measures 
The following risk minimisation measure in section V of the RMP version 33.2 were updated: 
No  other  significant  changes  were  made  regarding  other  potential  and  identified  risk  as  well  as  missing 
information in tables V.1. Considering the OC raised on the status of the PK study as a recommended post-
authorisation measure (REC), changes were applied to this section and to every other concerned section of the 
RMP. The Applicant submitted a RMP version 33.4 which is accepted.  
The Educational Material will cover all approved dosages (0.4 mg/2 mg/8 mg) and approved formats (2 mg 
aflibercept  PFS,  2/8  mg  aflibercept  vial)  which  is  similar  to  the  conduct  which  was  taken  in  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002392/II/0077/G (positive approval in end of 2022). This is acceptable as the safety profile seems 
similar between the 2 and 8 mg and as the Applicant will highlight the differences between the two dosages 
including injection volume/dose, indications, packaging/labeling, and format PFS/vial.  
Furthermore, a common EM will be available in case of favourable issue of this procedure and that, after CHMP 
opinion, EU PI for the 114.3 mg/ml will be merged to the complete Eylea EU PI. Thus Annex IID of the SmPC 
and Annex 6 of the RMP will have to apply to the different strengths, presentations (vial and PFS as applicable) 
and indications of Eylea.  
However, the following key elements in bold are not applicable in the 8 mg:  
• 
• 
Pre-filled syringe, the vial and the paediatric dosing device are for single use only  
Use of the paediatric dosing device is mandatory

The need to properly prime the paediatric dosing device before injection “ 
Therefore, the Applicant updated the Annex VI of the RMP v 33.4 and IID of the SmPC as follow (in red):  
Physician information  
Intravitreal injection procedure video 
Intravitreal injection procedure pictogram  
Patient information packs (for adult population only) 
The physician information in the educational material contains the following key elements: 
Techniques for the intravitreal injection including use of a 30 G needle, and angle of injection 
Pre-filled syringe, the vial and the paediatric dosing device are for single use only  
The vial is for single use only 
The need to expel excess volume of the syringe before injecting Eylea to avoid overdose (in adult 
population only) 
Patient monitoring after intravitreal injection including monitoring for visual acuity and increase of 
intraocular pressure post-injection 
Key signs and symptoms of intravitreal injection related adverse events including endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, retinal pigment epithelial tear and cataract 
Female patients of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception and pregnant women should 
not use Eylea (in adult population only) 
The following key element is specific to the 40 mg/mL:  
•  The pre-filled syringe and paediatric dosing device are for single use only 
The following key elements are specific to the ROP (retinopathy of prematurity) indication: 
•  Use of the paediatric dosing device is mandatory 
•  The need to properly prime the paediatric dosing device before injection 
•  Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC having considered the data submitted is of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 33.4 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system

2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for by the MAH is for the treatment of adult patients with nAMD and DME.  
The  aim  of  new  strength  (aflibercept  8  mg)  proposed  by  the  MAH  is  to  decrease  the  patient/healthcare 
professional’s burden (number of visits and IVT injections, adverse events associated with the IVT injections 
…). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatments of patients with nAMD and DME are initiated as soon as diagnosed by anti-VEGF marketed products 
in  Europe  (EYLEA®  –  aflibercept;  LUCENTIS®  –  ranibizumab  and  biosimilars;  BEOVU®  –  broculizumab; 
VABYSMO® – faricimab), laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy in order to stop the disease progression. Despite 
progress  in  its  current  treatment  and  management,  both  diseases  remains  incurable.  Patients  receiving  the 
anti-VEGH  therapy  undergo  specific  dosing  regimen  with  regard  to  the  molecule  used  for  their  treatment. 
However,  the  actual  dosing  regimen  for  the  anti-VEGF  therapy  are  limited  to  4  month  interval  in  the 
maintenance phase.  
Aflibercept is a known anti-VEGF molecule use as a standard of care in both indications (nAMD and DME).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program of aflibercept consisted of three studies including two considered as pivotal 
and one supportive: 
• 
• 
• 
Study  PHOTON  (21091,  VGFTe-HD-DME-1934):  an  on-going  (with  data  through  Week  60),  multi-
center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled Phase 2/3 study in participants with DME.  
Study PULSAR (20968): an on-going (with data through Week 60), multi-center, randomized, double-
masked, active-controlled Phase 3 study in participants with nAMD.  
Study  CANDELA  (21086,  VGFTe  (HD)-AMD-1905):  completed  (supportive  study),  multi-
centerrandomized, single-masked, active-controlled Phase 2 study in participants with nAMD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 224/235 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PULSAR Study (20968) is  an on-going, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled  Phase 3 
study in participants with nAMD (ratio 1:1:1, 2q8, HDq12, HDq16). 
PHOTON  study  (21091,  VGFTe-HD-DME-1934)  is  an  on-going,  multi-center,  randomized,  double-masked, 
active-controlled Phase 2/3 study in participants with DME (ratio 1:2:1, 2q8, HDq12, HDq16).  
Both studies intend to demonstrate the non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg (70µL of 114.3 mg/mL), every 12 or 
16 weeks compared to aflibercept 2 mg (50 µL of 40 mg/mL) and included patients accordingly to their disease. 
Treatment  success  (primary  efficacy  variable),  was  defined  with  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  (ETDRS 
letter score) at Week 48, completed with a key secondary endpoint of that measure at Week 60. Overall, the 
primary  and  key  secondary  endpoint  criteria,  to  know,  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  measured  by  the 
ETDRS  letter  score  at  Week  48  and  60  (non-inferiority  of  IVT aflibercept  therapy  HDq12  and  HDq16  dosing 
regimen to the current authorized IVT aflibercept therapy 2q8 dosing regimen) is considered to be statistically 
met  (95%  credible  interval  for  treatment  difference  with  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  4  letters  with  LS  mean 
change from baseline in BCVA to Week 48 and 60), at Week 48 and 60 for both studies. 
Moreover, based on data from PULSAR (snapshot including all patients with approx. 80% completed Week 96 
data collection) and on the data from all patients in PHOTON, HD aflibercept dosed every 12 weeks or every 
16 weeks showed maintained efficacy through Week 96 compared to 2 mg aflibercept, consistent with the non-
inferiority demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to improvement in BCVA in patients with nAMD 
or DME. Through Week 96, HD aflibercept provided improvements in mean change in CST in both nAMD and 
DME  populations,  consistent  with  the  results  reported  at  Week 48  and  Week  60.  Indeed,  the  preliminary 
Week 96 data from the PULSAR study and the full Week 96 data from PHOTON further support the proposed 
dosing regimens for nAMD and DME of 8 mg aflibercept administered by intravitreal injection 
In  both  studies,  a  large  majority  of  patients  treated  with  HD  aflibercept  had  treatment  intervals  of  every 
≥ 12 weeks and every ≥ 16 weeks which led to a clinically meaningful reduction in the number of injections 
for Week 96 completers.  In PULSAR, the number of injections were reduced from a mean of 12.8 injections in 
2q8 down to 9.8 (-23%) and to 8.2 (-36%) in HDq12 and HDq16, respectively; in PHOTON, from a mean of 
13.8 in 2q8 down to 9.5 (-31%) and 7.8 (-43%) in HDq12 and HDq16, respectively. 
In both studies, a high proportion of patients in the HD groups (48% and 56% respectively in the PHOTON and 
PULSAR  HDq16  groups)  extended  their  treatment  intervals  to  q20  or  longer  while  only  a  very  few  patients 
extended to intervals of q20 required a subsequent shortening of the treatment interval. As for the requested 
2-year data, the Applicant provided exposure details for patients who extended their treatment interval to q20 
or longer. Through Week 96, up to 47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or 
longer intervals in the PULSAR and PHOTON study respectively. Numerically, this correspond to a total of 185 
patients completed at least one q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 225/235 
 
 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24 
The other secondary endpoint differs in both studies: 
In PULSAR study, the proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in Central Subfield at Week 16 with a 
comparison  between  the  2q8  group  versus  pooled  HD  groups  (HDq12  and  HDq16)  was  assessed  and  the 
superiority appears to be statistically met for both HD groups at week 16. More long-term data were provided 
for this endpoint (week 48 and 60) and same tendency was observed with an absence of IRF and SRF more 
pronounce in the HD groups and more particularly in the HDq12 group.  
In PHOTON study, the proportion of participants with a ≥2-Step improvement in DRSS Score at Week 48 was 
assessed and the non-inferiority appears to be statistically met only in the HDq12 group at week 48. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The provided long term efficacy data from PULSAR and PHOTON studies are reassuring and it appears that the 
product dosed every 12 weeks (HDq12) or every 16 weeks (HDq16) showed maintained non-inferior efficacy 
through  Week  96  compared  to  2  mg  aflibercept,  consistent  with  the  results  demonstrated  at  Week  48  and 
Week 60 with respect to improvement in BCVA and CST in patients with nAMD or DME.  
To be noticed also that the per-protocol population which is a key population in non-inferiority trials is somewhat 
questionable  in  PULSAR  trial  for  it  includes  patients  presenting  with  deviations  to  planned  regimens  of 
administration. 
Finally, in response to the question about EDTRS reading process in Asian populations, the Applicant 
described a reading procedure but it is unclear if it was specific to Asian subjects or applied to all 
geographical regions. As noted above, it is anyway to be noticed that point-estimates of treatment effect go 
in opposite directions for Asian and Europe.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Aflibercept 8 mg (114.93 mg/mL) up to week 60 in nAMD and DME indications appears 
comparable to the already established profile of Eylea in adults.  
In  nAMD,  comparable  proportions  were  reported  for  ocular,  non-ocular  TEAEs  and  serious  TEAE.  The  most 
reported ocular TEAE consisted of “Visual acuity reduced”, “Cataract” and “Retinal haemorrhage” which were 
mostly mild to moderate in severity. Incidences of ocular and non-ocular TEAE leading to discontinuation were 
low and comparable, with “Retinal haemorrhage”, solely, being reported in n≥ 2 patients. 
In DME, higher incidence of ocular and non-ocular TEAE were reported in HD group. Most reported ocular TEAE 
consisted of “Cataract”, Retinal haemorrhage” and “Vitreous floaters”. TEAE were mostly mild to moderate in 
severity. Serious TEAE were reported in comparable proportions. 
Incidences  were  comparable  for  study  drug-related  and  IVT  injection-procedure  TEAE  in  both  studies.  TEAE 
assessed as related to study drug and IVT injection were consistent with the known safety profile of Eylea. 
In  PULSAR,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  low  and  comparable.  In  PHOTON  slightly  more  patients 
discontinued study drug in HD group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/538733/2023 
Page 226/235 
 
 
Non-ocular  TEAE  were  reported  in  comparable  proportions  with  the  most  reported  SOC  being  Vascular 
disorders, Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders.  
 A total of 14 and 1 patients died in respectively nAMD and DME studies up to week 96. Incidences of deaths 
were lower in the HD group in both studies (2.1% and 3.6% in PULSAR and 4.7% vs 5.4% 2q8 in PHOTON). 
None were assessed to aflibercept (study drug, IVT injection and protocol procedure).  
AESI were in general comparable between groups in both studies and no clinically relevant laboratory findings 
in  the  mean  or  median  changes  from  baseline  in  PULSAR  and  PHOTON  were  observed.  No  case  of 
endophthalmitis were reported in both studies for HD group.  
Furthermore, non-clinical data did not reveal any difference in the toxicity profile with a higher dose level. The 
safety margins for unilateral IVT treatment of patients with aflibercept 8 mg and IVT injection are considered 
significant.  
Regarding immunogenicity, in both nAMD and DME studies, the majority of the patients were ADA negative, 
No treatment-boosted ADA was observed, and all treatment-emergent responses were low titer (< 1000). . No 
relevant impact of treatment-emergent ADAs on the safety profile were observed. 
Additionally,  the  recommended  duration  of  contraception  for  females  of  reproductive  potential  following  the 
last dose of aflibercept 8 mg is 4 months (vs 3 months for Aflibercept 2 mg).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
At baseline, discrepancies could be observed in both nAMD and DME populations between HD group and 2q8 
regarding demographic characteristics and medical history. Further discussion was provided by the Applicant 
to assess the clinical relevance of the observed discrepancies on both efficacy and safety data assessment (see 
Efficacy section).   
Considering the exposure being 3 times higher compared to the already recommended dosing regimen of 2 mg 
every 8 weeks after a 3 monthly initiation phase, uncertainties were raised regarding the safety profile of HD 
aflibercept during the initiation phase. The Applicant provided discussion and although exposures to aflibercept 
in the HD treatment arms in both PULSAR and PHOTON studies were higher during the loading phase and that 
the incidence of ocular TEAE in the 2q8 arms in both groups were disparate (17,3% for 2q8 for nAMD and 2q8: 
9.6% in DME), safety data are still reassuring and in favour of a comparable safety profile with ocular and non-
ocular TEAE being reported in similar range between both studies. No consistent trend could be observed in 
both studies.    
Up to week 96, the majority of the patients had a treatment interval of ≥ 12 weeks (all HD 87.1% PULSAR and 
92.9% in PHOTON) and ≥ 16 weeks (all HD 69.2% PULSAR and 72.4% in PHOTON) and more than 40% of the 
patients in both studies had extended to q20 (46.6% in PULSAR and 44.8% in PHOTON). Proportion of patients 
shortened to HDq8 were higher for PULSAR (21.3% in all HD group) compared to PHOTON (10.6% in all HD 
group) and with a similar trend for proportions of patients in HDq8 regimen which were low in both studies and 
higher in nAMD population (13.1% in PULSAR and 7.3% in PHOTON). As the patients with an HDq20 interval 
regimen are less exposed, no worsening of the safety profile is expected. Safety data for HDq8 were submitted 
and  compared  to  not  modified  HDq12/Hdq16  and  2q8.  No  consistent  trend  could  be  observed  for  higher 
reported  ocular  and  non-ocular  TEAE  and  the  safety  profile  seems  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of 
aflibercept 2 mg. In PHOTON in particular, lower ocular TEAE rates were reported.  An OC was raised in regards 
of the PI (section 4.2).

Further discussion was also provided for the topic hypertension, a listed event for aflibercept administered by 
IV, as a higher proportion was seen in all HD group at week 48 and 60. However, up to week 60, incidences 
were similar in PULSAR (2q8: 7.4%, all HD 8.0%) and PHOTON (2q8: 16.2%, all HD 15.5%). Compared to 
previous experience with Eylea 2 mg, similar or higher incidences were observed at 1 and 2 year in the 2 mg 
group compared to week 60 and 96 with 8 mg (for DME 25.8 % 2 mg at 2 years vs 17.3% at week 96 for all 
HD and for AMD 14.7% 2 mg at 2 years vs 8.0% at week 96 for all HD).  The risk of hypertension is currently 
monitored through the PSUR.  
Furthermore, the Applicant provided as requested safety data up to week 96 which confirms a similar safety 
profile for aflibercept 8 mg compared to the known profile of 2 mg. No new safety concern can be raised. The 
Applicant is requested to provide additional safety data regarding relatedness and severity for ocular and non-
ocular TEAEs.  
Approximately ≤20% of patients in PULSAR (AMD) and ≥ 50% of patients in PHOTON (DME) received bilateral 
treatment in the fellow eye with aflibercept 2 mg or another anti-VEGF (exclusively in PULSAR) up to week 60. 
Differences could be observed regarding baseline characteristics and medical history between unilateral and 
bilateral  treated  patients  and  thus  further  discussion  were  provided  for  both  studies.  For  nAMD  population, 
ocular TEAE were reported with comparable incidence and non-ocular TEAE were more reported in HD group 
(62.0%% for bilateral vs 50.9% for unilateral). For PHOTON (DME), incidences for ocular and non-ocular TEAE 
were  comparable  but  differences  could  be  observed.  AESI  (Cataract,  Hypertension,  IOP,  non-ocular 
haemorrhage, APCT) were reported in slightly higher proportion in bilateral therapy for HD group in both nAMD 
and DME. It is to be noted, that safety results for nAMD patients must be interpreted with caution considering 
the low group size of patients receiving bilateral therapy. Bilateral exposure is expected in clinical practice in 
both  nAMD  and  DME  populations,  however  safety  data  on  exposure  with  bilateral  therapy  with  8  mg  are 
currently  missing.  The  Applicant  proposed  a  phase  4  PK  study  to  evaluate  bilateral  exposure  with  8  mg 
aflibercept (Cmax and AUC) as a REC  and the topic will also be monitored through the PSUR. 
Additionally, in non-clinical trials, the observed absence of safety margin with HD aflibercept in animal study 
and  available  clinical  safety  data  with  aflibercept,  which  are  limited,  concluded  with  a  potential  signal  of 
spontaneous abortion/pregnancy loss that needs to be followed carefully.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The development plan of aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of nAMD and DME subjects is based on 2 pivotal 
studies (PULSAR and PHOTON) and a supportive study (CANDELA), also discussed in a scientific advice.   
PULSAR Study (20968) is an on-going, multi-center, randomized (1:1:1, 2q8, HDq12, HDq16), double-masked, 
active-controlled Phase 3 study in participants with nAMD and PHOTON study (21091, VGFTe-HD-DME-1934) 
is an on-going, multi-center, randomized (1:2:1, 2q8, HDq12, HDq16), double-masked, active-controlled Phase 
2/3  study  in  participants  with  DME.  Both  studies  aimed  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of 
intravitreal 8 mg aflibercept (HDq12 and HDq16) compared to aflibercept 2 mg. Participants were treated at 
baseline and rescue treatment (aflibercept 8 mg with a q8 IVT injection interval) could be administrated from 
Week 16 in HD groups as per the defined criteria.  
Treatment success (primary efficacy variable) was defined as the change from baseline in BCVA (ETDRS letter 
score) at Week 48, completed with a key secondary endpoint of that measure at week 60. Overall, the primary 
and key secondary endpoint criteria, to know, the change from baseline in BCVA measured by the ETDRS letter 
score at Week 48 and 60 (non-inferiority of IVT aflibercept therapy HDq12 and HDq16 dosing regimen to the 
current  authorized  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  2q8  dosing  regimen)  is  considered  to  be  statistically  met  (95% 
credible interval for treatment difference with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters with LS mean change from 
baseline in BCVA to Week 48 and 60), at Week 48 and 60 for both studies.

Moreover,  the  Applicant  provides  additional  new  long-term  data  from  PULSAR  study  where  around  80%  of 
patients  completed  Week  96  and  PHOTON  study  where  100%  completed  Week  96.  Of  ongoing  patients, 
approximately 80% (689 out of 875) had already completed the Week 96 visit and almost all had completed 
visits up to  Week 88. Overall and  based on the  provided long-term data, it  appears that the product  dosed 
every 12 weeks (HDq12) or every 16 weeks (HDq16) showed maintained non-inferior efficacy through Week 
96  compared  to  2  mg  aflibercept,  consistent  with  the  results  demonstrated  at  Week  48  and  Week  60  with 
respect to improvement in BCVA and CST in patients with nAMD or DME. 
Regarding the need for further data to support the 5 months injection interval during the maintenance phase, 
the  applicant  provides  additional  new  data  that  seems  adequate  to  support  the  claimed  q20  (or  longer) 
intervals. Through Week 96, up to 47% and 44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or 
longer intervals in the PULSAR and PHOTON study respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 
patients completed at least one q20 interval before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study 
At Week 96, the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing interval in the PULSAR 
was 36.8% in the HDq12 group and 54.9% in the HDq16 group. Of 216 HD patients that were extended to a 
q20  treatment  interval  at  any  time  through  Week  96,  the  majority  of  patients  maintained  on  q20  or  were 
extended even further to q24 (i.e. 53 and 127 HD patients, respectively); only a few patients were shortened 
back to q16 (i.e. 3 HD patients). 
For the PHOTON study, at Week 96 the proportion of patients with q20 or longer as the last intended dosing 
interval was 42.2% in the HDq12 group and 45.3% in the HDq16 group. Of 177 HD patients that were extended 
to a q20 treatment interval at any time through Week 96, the majority of patients maintained on q20 or were 
extended even further to q24. 
The other secondary endpoint differs in both studies: 
In PULSAR study, the proportion of participants with no IRF and no SRF in Central Subfield at Week 16 with a 
comparison  between  the  2q8  group  versus  pooled  HD  groups  (HDq12  and  HDq16)  was  assessed  and  the 
superiority appears to be statistically met for both HD groups at week 16. More long-term data were provided 
for this endpoint (week 48 and 60) and same tendency was observed with an absence of IRF and SRF more 
pronounce in the HD groups and more particularly in the HDq12 group.  
In PHOTON, despite the limitations in study design, the evaluation of DRSS was included in the study design 
in view of the fact that aflibercept 2 mg is in the US approved not only for the treatment of DME, but also for 
the treatment of DR. Therefore, evaluating the effects of aflibercept 8 mg on DRSS was considered relevant 
for that territory. The key secondary endpoint of the proportion of participants with a ≥ 2-step improvement 
in  DRSS  score  at  Week  48  was  pre-specified  to  potentially  support  an  indication  of  aflibercept  8  mg  for 
treatment of DR in the US. This endpoint was tested with a non-inferiority margin of 15% which was met by 
the  HDq12  arm  (adjusted  difference  1.98%,  95%  CI  -6.61,  10.57)  but  not  by  the  HDq16  arm  (adjusted 
difference -7.52%, 95% CI -16.88, 1.84). However, considering that the primary endpoint showed that BCVA 
improvement as a direct effect of DME treatment was non-inferior for HDq12 and HDq16 compared to 2q8, the 
Applicant concluded that the effect on DRSS stage improvement does not correlate with the with the effect on 
DME, and improvements in DRSS are not a prerequisite for vision improvements in DME. 
The safety profile of Eylea 8 mg (114.93 mg/mL) up to 60 weeks and week 96 in both nAMD and DME indications 
appears comparable to the already established profile of Eylea. Concerns raised regarding the higher exposure 
with HD groups during the initiation phase, uncertainties on systemic adverse events (hypertension), need for 
Assessment report

Page 231/235 
 
 
 
long-term  data  on  systemic  exposure  with  HD  group  up  to  96  weeks  and  also  on  bilateral  exposure  were 
answered by the Applicant and no safety issues were raised. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results available from two pivotal studies (PULSAR and PHOTON) for aflibercept 8 mg showed statistical non-
inferiority in treatment success rates of HDq12 and HDq16 (change in BCVA measured by EDTRS score from 
baseline) compared with aflibercept 2 mg up to 60 weeks after initial treatment.  
The lacking and thus requested long-term efficacy data have been provided within the Applicant responses to 
list of questions. Based on data from PULSAR (snapshot including all patients, with approx. 80% completed 
Week 96 data collection) and on the data from all patients in PHOTON, HD aflibercept dosed every 12 weeks 
or every 16 weeks showed maintained efficacy through Week 96 compared to 2 mg aflibercept, consistent with 
the non-inferiority demonstrated at Week 48 and Week 60 with respect to improvement in BCVA in patients 
with nAMD or DME. In addition, through Week 96, HD aflibercept provided substantial improvements in mean 
change in CST in both nAMD and DME populations, consistent with the results reported at Week 48 and Week 
60. 
Given the longer intervals in the new proposed dosing regimen (HDq12 and HDq16) and limited data to support 
the claimed 5 months injection interval during the maintenance phase, the Applicant provides additional new 
data that seems adequate to support the claimed q20 (or longer) intervals. Through Week 96, up to 47% and 
44.3% of HD patients extended their treatment interval to q20 or longer intervals in the PULSAR and PHOTON 
study respectively. Numerically, this corresponds to a total of 185 patients completed at least one q20 interval 
before Week 96 in PULSAR and 133 patients in PHOTON study. Overall, the results for this cohort of patients 
are in line with global results. 
The safety profile of Eylea 8 mg appears comparable to the known safety profile of Eylea. Long term data up 
to week 96, safety data during the initiation phase and for patient who had shortened to HDq8 or extended 
HDq20 were provided by the Applicant and no concerns could be raised.  
The benefit/risk balance is positive.

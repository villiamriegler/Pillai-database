Introduction 
On July 30, 2013, the MAH submitted seven completed paediatric studies for palivizumab, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview for each study has also been provided. 
The MAH states that four of the submitted paediatric studies (M12-420, W10-664, MI-CP118, MI-
CP127) do not influence the benefit risk for palivizumab and that no consequential regulatory action is 
required.  
Studies MI-CP116, MI-CP110 and MI-CP124 will be submitted as supportive clinical experience in an 
extension application consisting of the full relevant data package to register the solution for injection 
formulation in the EU; expected to be submitted by October 2013.

Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) specific for the fusion protein (F-protein) of 
RSV that has potent neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity against a broad range of RSV isolates. 
Based on clinical studies in children with chronic lung disease the product was licensed in the US in 
1998 and in the EU in 1999. Further studies have subsequently been conducted in different patient 
groups and the indications currently approved are 
“SYNAGIS is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  
•   Children  born  at  35  weeks  of  gestation  or  less  and  less  than  6  months  of  age  at  the  onset  of  the 
RSV season.  
•   Children  less  than  2  years  of  age  and  requiring  treatment  for  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  within 
the last 6 months.  
•   Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.”  
The pharmaceutical formulations used in the studies were: 
Palivizumab was provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of palivizumab in 1 mL of a sterile 
preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM histidine, and 1.6 mM glycine. 
Lyophilized palivizumab was provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg 
Motavizumab was provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of motavizumab in 1 mL of a sterile 
preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM histidinehydrochloride. As 
mentioned above, the development of motavizumab has been discontinued.

Clinical studies 
M12-420. Multi-center, Open-label, Uncontrolled Clinical Study of Palivizumab in Japanese 
Newborns, Infants and Young Children at the Age of 24 Months or Less with 
Immunocompromised Medical Conditions 
Description 
Methods 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of palivizumab in 
children at the age of 24 months or less with immunocompromised medical conditions.                                                                                                                  
The secondary objective was to evaluate the trough serum concentration  (Ctrough) of palivizumab 
obtained from Japanese subjects with immunocompromised medical conditions, compared to the Ctrough 
of palivizumab numerically with available previous data in Japanese premature newborns and infants, 
and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and children with hemodynamically significant 
congenital heart disease (CHD).   
•  Study design 
A phase 3, multi-center, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple-dose study to evaluate safety, efficacy and 
PK of palivizumab in newborns, infants and young children at the age of 24 months or less with 
immunocompromised medical conditions. The study period consisted of a screening period, an 
administration period of the study drug, and a safety follow-up period after the subject either 
completed or prematurely discontinued from the study.   
The subjects were to be enrolled into this study after obtaining the written informed consent to 
participate in this study from subject’s parents or legal guardians.  The time from enrollment to the 
initial administration of the study drug was defined as the screening period.  The investigator was to 
judge which subjects would be eligible for entry into the study during the screening period and select 
eligible subjects as study subjects as defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following the 
screening period, the selected subjects were to receive a minimum of 4 doses up to a maximum of 7 
doses of the study drug palivizumab at 15 mg/kg of body weight by intramuscular injection every 30 
days during the 2011 - 2012 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season.   
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 4/29 
 
 
 
 
Blood samples for evaluation of palivizumab Ctrough were to be collected at Screening, Day 31 and Day 
121, or 30 days after the last dose of the study drug, if the subject was discontinued prior to the 5th 
administration of the study drug.  Evaluation of efficacy with regard to subject’s hospitalization 
associated with RSV infection, included requirement for oxygen supplementation, mechanical 
ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure, other 
mechanical respiratory support or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for RSV hospitalizations was to 
be performed from the initial dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.  Safety was to be 
assessed at Screening, Day 1, 31, 61, 91 and 121 or at the early termination (ET) visit, and at Day 
151, 181, or 211 if a 5th, 6th or 7th administration of the study drug was given, respectively. The 
subjects who completed the study or who prematurely discontinued from the study were to have a 
100-day follow-up after the last administration of the study drug to evaluate adverse events (AEs).

No subjects experienced a confirmed RSV hospitalization after the initial dose to 30 days after the last 
dose of the study drug.  As such, the incidence of RSV hospitalization was 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-12.3) in 
the study.  As such, no subject required any treatments for RSV infection after the initial dose to 30 
days after the last dose of the study drug, so the proportion of subjects who required treatment was 
0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-12.3) in this study.  Therefore, the prophylactic use of palivizumab was considered 
to be effective in Japanese newborns, infants and young children at the age of 24 months or less with 
immunocompromised medical conditions in preventing serious disease due to RSV infection.   
•  Safety results 
Of the 28 subjects treated with study drug, all subjects received at least 2 doses of study drug, 27 
subjects (96.4%) received at least 4 doses and 16 subjects (57.1%) received 7 doses.  Twenty-seven 
subjects (96.4%) experienced at least one AE during treatment through 100 days following the last 
dose of the study drug.   
The most frequently reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (10 subjects, 35.7%), 
gastroenteritis and eczema (9 subjects each, 32.1%), and influenza (6 subjects, 21.4%).  These AEs 
reported in the study are commonly observed in newborns, infants and young children in health or 
immunocompromised medical conditions.   
The majority of AEs were assessed as mild or moderate in severity by the investigator. Two subjects 
(7.1%) experienced at least one severe AE during the study.  One subject experienced encephalopathy 
and another experienced gastrointestinal perforation, infectious peritonitis and duodenal stenosis 
reported as severe AEs.   
No AEs were assessed as possibly or probably related to study drug by the investigator.  Seven 
subjects (25.0%) experienced AEs assessed as probably not related to study drug during the study.  
Nasopharyngitis was the only AE assessed as probably not related to study drug that was reported in 
more than 1 subject (2 subjects).   
Thirteen SAEs were reported in 7 subjects (25.0%) in the study.  The most frequently reported SAEs 
were gastroenteritis (3 subjects, 10.7%) and bronchitis (2 subjects, 7.1%).  Of the 13 SAEs, 9 and 4 
events were assessed as moderate and severe, respectively.  Twelve events were assessed as not 
related to study drug, while 1 event (encephalopathy) was assessed as probably not related to study 
drug.  One subject, who experienced the SAE of encephalopathy, also experienced an SAE of 
gastroenteritis during the study.  The encephalopathy was assessed as a persistent disability that was 
severe and probably not related to study drug; and the subject had not recovered from the event by 
the end of the study.  Due to the SAE of encephalopathy, the subject prematurely discontinued the 
study after the 4th dose of study drug.   
Eight subjects experienced 11 AEs suspected to be RSV infection in the study.  Of the 11 events, 4 
events resulted in hospitalization (One subject: bronchitis, one subject: pneumonia, one subject: croup 
infectious and pneumonia bacterial).  In these 4 events, RSV antigen detection tests were performed 
and a negative result was obtained in each case.   
EMA/780068/2013

Page 8/29 
 
 
 
There were no deaths, AEs leading to death or AEs assessed as possibly or probably related to study 
drug by the investigator during the study.   
None of the mean changes from baseline in variables of hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis 
qualitative analysis and vital sign were considered clinically important throughout the study.   
CHMP’s comment:  
This small study was requested by the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency and 
conducted in 2011-2012. Children with immunocompromised medical conditions are outside of the 
patient populations included in the current indication for prophylaxis in the EU. None of the 28 children 
experienced a confirmed RSV hospitalization after the initial dose to 30 days after the last dose of the 
study drug in the study; and no subjects required additional treatment for RSV infection after the initial 
dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. Palivizumab was generally safe and well 
tolerated. Furthermore, serum palivizumab trough concentrations in these children with 
immunocompromised medical conditions were comparable to those in Japanese premature with 
hemodynamically significant CHD and Japanese premature newborns or pediatric subjects with BPD. 
W10-664. A Prospective, Multicenter, Open-Label, Non-Comparative Study of Safety and 
Efficacy of Synagis in Children at High Risk of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in 
the Russian Federation. 
Description 
Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
The objective of this study was to describe the safety and efficacy of palivizumab in the prevention of 
severe RSV infection in preterm infants (≤ 35 wGA), infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 
infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease in the Russian Federation. 
•  Study design 
A Phase 2 to 3, prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative clinical study of 
immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for the prevention of severe lower respiratory tract RSV infection 
in infants at high risk. Approximately 100 subjects were to be enrolled into the study in the Russian 
Federation. Recruitment was to start November 2009 and continue no later than 31 January 2010. All 
enrolled subjects had to undergo monthly visits with safety assessments and administration of 
palivizumab IM 15 mg/kg for passive immune protection during the RSV season defined as November 
2009 through March 2010. All subjects enrolled were to be followed by a telephone contact 30 and 100 
days after last injection. All respiratory/cardiac hospitalizations or deterioration in the 
respiratory/cardiac status in a hospitalized subject were to be evaluated with a diagnostic test for RSV 
(rapid immunochromatographic) to determine if RSV contributed to the hospitalization or deterioration. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Infants at high risk of severe RSV infection defined as preterm infants born ≤ 35 weeks gestational age 
and ≤ 6 months of age at enrollment; or infants ≤ 24 months of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) requiring intervention/management any time within 6 months prior 
to enrollment; or infants ≤ 24 months at enrollment with hemodynamically significant congenital heart 
disease (HSCHD). 
A total of 100 subjects were planned to be enrolled to receive passive immunization against RSV 
infection with palivizumab during the 2009/2010 RSV season.

• 
Treatments 
Palivizumab was provided in 5 mL single-use glass vials designed to deliver 100 mg of palivizumab in 
1.0 mL (100 mg/mL) when reconstituted with 1.0 mL of sterile water for injection. Palivizumab 15 
mg/kg was to be administered intramuscular every 30 days, beginning at the time of enrollment in 
November or December 2009 or January 2010, through March 2010. Depending on the month of 
enrollment, November, December or January, subjects were to receive 5, 4 or 3 injections, 
respectively. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable in this study was hospitalization due to RSV infection. 
Respiratory and cardiac hospitalization was defined as hospitalization occurring in a time frame from 
the first dose of study drug until 30 days (+ 5 days) after the last injection, with primary reason for 
hospital admission being evaluation or treatment of a respiratory/cardiac condition. Also, the new 
onset of respiratory/cardiac symptoms in an already hospitalized subject, with an objective measure of 
worsening respiratory/cardiac status was rated a respiratory/cardiac hospitalization. 
RSV hospitalization was defined as either: 1) a respiratory/cardiac hospitalization with a positive RSV 
test, 2) the new onset of respiratory/cardiac symptoms in an already hospitalized subject, with an 
objective measure of worsening respiratory/cardiac status and a positive RSV test, or 3) death, that 
could be demonstrated as caused by RSV (by autopsy, clinical history, or virologic evidence). RSV 
hospitalizations were registered from the time of the first dose until 30 days (+ 5 days) after the last 
injection of palivizumab.           
Secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
Total number of days of hospitalization due to RSV infection 
•  Days of hospitalization due to RSV infection with increased supplemental oxygen requirement 
•  Number of admissions to intensive care (ICU) during hospitalization due to RSV infection 
• 
Total days of ICU stay due to RSV infection 
•  Number of subjects with mechanical ventilation during hospitalization due to RSV infection 
• 
Total days of mechanical ventilation during hospitalization due to RSV infection 
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability of palivizumab were assessed by summarizing adverse events occurring from 
enrollment until 100 days following the last injection of study drug. In addition, vital signs and physical 
findings were obtained at each visit, both pre- and post-injection. 
•  Statistical Methods 
No formal sample size calculation was performed. It was determined prior to the start of the study, 
that approximately 100 treated subjects would provide sufficient data. 
Data were summarized descriptively. For continuous variables, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum values were calculated. For categorical variables, number and percentage of 
subjects in each category within an assessment were calculated for non-missing data.

All analyses were performed as intent-to-treat (ITT), defined as enrolled subjects who received at least 
one dose of study drug. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
As planned, 100 subjects were enrolled at 19 centers in the Russian Federation and constituted the 
intent-to-treat analysis set. Among those 100 subjects, 2 subjects violated inclusion criterion 1 
(subjects at high risk of severe RSV infection), one subject violated exclusion criterion 11 (exclusion of 
prior administration of RSV vaccine or prophylaxis). In total, 94 subjects completed the study as 
planned, while 6 withdrew prematurely (1 due to an adverse event, 1 due to refusal to participate, and 
4 because of parent(s) being unable/not willing to perform onsite visits). 
•  Baseline data 
All 100 subjects were enrolled in either November (64 subjects) or December (36 subjects) 2009 of 
which 48/100 (48%) were male and 52/100 (52%) were female. Ninety eight (98) enrolled subjects 
fulfilled the requirements for subjects at high risk of severe RSV infection, defined as born prematurely 
(≤ 35 wGA) and younger than 6 months at the time of  enrollment or suffering from 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) of prematurity or hemodynamically significant congenital heart 
disease (HSCHD) and younger than 24 months at the time of enrollment. Two subjects, who both were 
both born preterm and had BPD, did not meet inclusion criterion because they were born after 36 wGA 
and thus did not meet the either the preterm criteria (≤ 35 wGA) or BPD criteria for requiring oxygen 
at 36 wGA. Mean gestational age was 33.4 weeks (SD 5.1) ranging from 24 to 42 weeks. Mean birth 
weight was 2.14 kg. As to the medical history, respiratory distress syndrome/bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia was seen in 52/100, and congenital heart disease in 41/100 subjects. A pathological murmur 
was found in 30/100 subjects. For 78/100 subjects the conditions diagnosed were symptomatic at 
baseline or requiring treatment, among them 34/100 subjects with respiratory distress 
syndrome/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 33/100 subjects with hemodynamically significant 
congenital heart disease. 
•  Efficacy results 
During the entire study period there was no case of RSV hospitalization. An RSV test (rapid 
immunochromatographic) was performed in 6 of 7 subjects experiencing a respiratory/cardiac 
hospitalization, but was negative in all cases. One subject did not have an RSV test performed. Since 
there were no cases of RSV hospitalization, the planned secondary efficacy parameters could not be 
evaluated. 
•  Safety results 
The total number of doses administered is presented below: 
The planned number of doses depended on whether the subject was enrolled in November (64) or 
December (36). Two subjects enrolled in December received 6 doses of palivizumab due to additional 
doses following cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery. In total, 4 of 15 subjects who 
underwent cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery received an additional dose of palivizumab. 
Six (6) subjects terminated the study prematurely prior to the fourth administration of study drug, and 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 11/29 
 
 
 
 
 
a seventh subject did not receive their fourth dose due to an in-hospital SAE following cardiac surgery, 
extending the dosing period outside the RSV season. The total amount of palivizumab administered in 
the study ranged from 47 to 1022 mg with a mean of 516.5 mg (SD 192.3, median 507.5 mg). 
Eighty (80) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were documented in 41 of 100 subjects 
(41%) through 30 days following the last injection. During the period of 100 days after last injection, 
84 TEAEs occurred in 44/100 subjects (44%). One non-serious TEAE (atopic dermatitis) led to 
discontinuation of the study drug. This event was assessed as mild in severity and possibly related to 
study drug. Three TEAEs in 3 subjects were rated as severe in intensity: one case each of arrhythmia, 
pneumonia and tonsillitis, all assessed as not related to study drug. Three TEAEs in 2 subjects were 
assessed as possibly related (acute intermittent rhinitis and rhinitis, both in one subject, and atopic 
dermatitis). All other AEs/TEAEs were assessed as mild or moderate, and as not related or probably 
not related to study drug. 
In total, 12 TESAEs occurred in 10 subjects, mainly coded as infectious diseases (7 subjects) such as 
bronchitis, enteritis, tonsillitis, or pneumonia. All TESAEs were, however, categorized as being not 
related to study drug. 
No clinically relevant changes in vital signs were seen when comparing mean visit values (pre-
injection) versus baseline (Visit 1; Day 0). Neither were there significant changes when comparing vital 
sign values measured prior to and following injection of the study drug. Body weight increased with 
age as expected. 
CHMP’s comments:  
The liquid formulation of palivizumab, which is not approved in Europe, was used in this small open 
Russian study conducted 2009/2010. 98 children fulfilling the approved indications for Synagis were 
enrolled (33% were preterm infants born ≤ 35 weeks GA and ≤ 6 months of age at enrollment, 46% 
were infant's ≤ 24 months of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of BPD, and 30% infants ≤ 24 months 
at enrollment with HSCHD). The efficacy and safety was in accordance with results of other studies. 
MI-CP118 - A Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 
MEDI-524, a Humanized Enhanced Potency Monoclonal Antibody Against Respiratory 
Syncytial Virus (RSV), after Dosing for a Second Season in Children who Previously Received 
MEDI-524 in Protocol MI-CP104 
Description 
Methods 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect on immune reactivity to MEDI-524 of 
monthly intramuscular (IM) doses of MEDI-524 administered for a second season in children who 
previously received MEDI-524 in protocol MI-CP104. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to: 
1. Describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI-524 administered for a second season 
2. Describe the serum concentration of MEDI-524 administered for a second season 
•  Study design 
A Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind study in which MEDI-524 or palivizumab was administered to 
children who previously participated in MI-CP104. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive MEDI-524 
EMA/780068/2013

Page 12/29 
 
 
 
or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM injection every 30 days for a total of 4-5 injections during the 2004-
05 RSV season subsequent to the season in which they were participants of MI-CP104. All patients 
were evaluated prior to and 30 minutes after each injection of study drug with 2 follow-up evaluations, 
one at 30 days and the other at 90-120 days after the last dose. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Children who received at least 3 doses of MEDI-524 in MI-CP104 were eligible for enrollment. 
Approximately 150 patients were planned for enrollment. 
• 
Treatments 
MEDI-524 or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM injection every 30 days for a total of 4-5 injections during 
the 2004-05 RSV season subsequent to the season in which they were participants of MI-CP104. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics: Serum for measurement of anti-MEDI-524 antibodies and 
MEDI-524 concentrations was collected prior to the first, second and, if applicable, fifth doses of study 
drug, and at the 2 follow-up visits 30 and 90-120 days after the last dose. 
Safety: Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications were 
collected from the period immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study 
Day 120 for patients who received 4 doses, and Study Day 150 for patients who received 5 doses of 
study drug. Blood was collected prior to the first, second and, if applicable, fifth doses of study drug, 
and at 30 days after the last dose for serum chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) evaluation. 
•  Statistical Methods 
All tabular summaries were presented by treatment group. Categorical data were summarized by the 
number and percent of patients in each category. Continuous variables were summarized by 
descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. No statistical tests 
were planned or conducted. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
136 were randomized (66 MEDI-524;70 palivizumab). All children received study drug and had follow-
up for safety, and are therefore included in all summaries of safety and immunogenicity. Two patients, 
both in the MEDI-524 group, were excluded from the pharmacokinetics analyses subsequent to 
receiving an incorrect dose or missing a dose. 
•  Baseline data 
The patients in this study were children (≤24 months of age) who previously participated in MI-CP104 
and received at least 3 injections of MEDI-524 in that study. Baseline demographics were similar and 
balanced between the MEDI-524 and palivizumab groups. The study drugs were well-tolerated with a 
total of 131 (96.3%) children completing the study, 4 withdrew consent, and 1 was lost to follow-up. A 
total of 98% (64/66) of children assigned to the MEDI-524 group received 5 (82%) or 4 (16%) doses 
of study drug. One child in the MEDI-524 group was permanently discontinued from study drug, due to 
a serious adverse event (hypersensitivity). 
• 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-MEDI-524 binding activity responses (defined as a titer with a dilution of ≥1:10) were detected at 
baseline prior to second-season dosing in 2 (3.0%) patients in the MEDI-524 group, 1 of whom also 
had anti-MEDI-524 binding activity detected previously during participation in MI-CP104. However, no 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 13/29 
 
 
 
anti-MEDI-524 binding activity responses were detected after dosing through study completion in any 
patient who received MEDI-524, including the 2 patients with anti-MEDI-524 binding activity detected 
at baseline prior to second-season dosing. Both patients achieved MEDI-524 serum trough drug levels 
through 90-120 days post final dose that were within the range of values seen in patients who had no 
anti-MEDI-524 binding activity detected pre-dose. 
In a post hoc analysis, anti-palivizumab binding activity responses (defined as a titer with a dilution of 
≥1:10) in patients who received palivizumab in this trial were not detected at any time point before or 
after dosing (through 90-120 days after final dose). 
•  Safety results 
A total of 56 (84.8%) MEDI-524 patients and 62 (88.6%) palivizumab patients experienced at least 1 
AE. The majority (96% MEDI-524; 99% palivizumab) of AEs were Level 1 or 2 in severity. The pattern 
and type of AEs were generally consistent with the underlying conditions in this pediatric age group, 
and the incidence was similar between the MEDI-524 and palivizumab treatment groups. Laboratory 
abnormalities in routine blood chemistry or hematology occurred infrequently and, for the most part, 
were mild in severity. 
A total of 12 patients in each of the MEDI-524 (18.2%) and palivizumab (17.1%) groups experienced 
at least 1 AE considered to be related to study drug. The most common of these was injection site 
erythema (15.2% MEDI-524; 11.4% palivizumab); all the events were transient lasting 1-2 days, were 
judged to be Level 1 in severity, and appeared not to be associated with dose number. A total of 5 
children (4[6.1%] MEDI-524; 1[1.4%] palivizumab) experienced 6 serious adverse events (SAEs); 5 
were judged to be unrelated to study drug and 1 related SAE, an acute hypersensitivity event, 
occurred immediately following the third dose of MEDI-524 and resulted in discontinuation of further 
dosing. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
In children given repeat doses of 15 mg/kg MEDI-524 during a second RSV season, mean trough 
serum MEDI-524 concentrations rose throughout dosing as expected. The mean serum trough levels 
and ranges of MEDI-524 in MI-CP118 following the first and fourth dose [54.6 μg/mL (range: 16.5-
87.2 μg/mL) and 86.2 μg/mL (range: 37.5-148 μg/mL), respectively] were similar to those achieved in 
the first season of dosing in MI-CP104 [50.2 μg/mL (range: 2.76-106 μg/mL) and 86.2 μg/mL (range: 
0-194 μg/mL), respectively]. By 90-120 days post final dose, MEDI-524 levels in all patients were 
below 30 μg/mL. 
CHMP’s comments:  
In this study children who received repeat doses of motavizumab in the RSV season 2004/2005, were 
randomized 1:1 to receive motavizumab or palivizumab during the following RSV season. The 
treatment was well tolerated. Anti-motavizumab binding activity was not detected during dosing 
through 90-120 days after the final dose in any patient who received motivuzumab for a second 
season, including 2 children who had anti-motavizumab binding activity detected prior to the start of 
second-season dosing. As indicated previously, the development of motavizumab has been 
discontinued.

Description 
Methods 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of motavizumab and 
palivizumab when administered during the same RSV season. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
1. To describe the immunogenicity of motavizumab and palivizumab when administered during the 
same season 
2. To describe the serum concentrations of motavizumab and palivizumab when administered during 
the same season 
•  Study design 
This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind study in which motavizumab and palivizumab were 
administered to high-risk children during the same RSV season. It was anticipated that approximately 
240 children (80 in each group) would be enrolled from the southern hemisphere during the upcoming 
RSV season (2006). Children were randomized into one of three regimens in a 1:1:1 ratio; the first 
group received 2 doses of motavizumab followed by 3 doses of palivizumab; the second group received 
2 doses of palivizumab followed by 3  doses of motavizumab; and the third group received 5 doses of 
motavizumab. Motavizumab or palivizumab were administered at 15 mg/kg by IM injection every 30 
days, for a total of 5 injections. 
Children were evaluated just prior to each injection of study drug, at Study Day 150, and 120-150 
days after the last dose. Monitoring for adverse events and serious adverse events occurred through 
Study Day 150. Blood was collected on Study Day 0 (prior to the first dose), prior to the third dose 
(Study Day 60), and on Study Day 150 for anti-motavizumab and anti-palivizumab antibody, serum 
levels of motavizumab and palivizumab, and serum chemistry, with an additional blood sample taken 
120-150 days after the last dose for anti-motavizumab and antipalivizumab antibody and serum levels 
of motavizumab and palivizumab.

•  Statistical Methods 
All tabular summaries were presented by treatment group. Categorical data were summarized by the 
number and percent of patients in each category. Continuous variables were summarized by 
descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 18 investigators at 7 Chilean sites, 6 Australian sites, and 5 New Zealand sites participated in 
the study. A total of 260 children (83, 2 doses motavizumab, 3 doses palivizumab; 84, 2 doses 
palivizumab, 3 doses motavizumab; 93, 5 doses motavizumab) were randomized into the study. 
•  Baseline data 
Baseline demographics were similar and balanced among the 3 groups with the exception that 61% of 
patients in the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab group were male, compared to 51% and 52% in the 
mixed palivizumab/motavizumab and control motavizumab treatment groups, respectively. 
•  Efficacy results 
N/A 
•  Safety results 
Overall, the 3 treatment groups had similar rates of AEs (92.8% mixed motavizumab/palivizumab, 
90.4% mixed palivizumab/motavizumab, 89.2% control motavizumab), with the majority of AEs Level 
1 or 2 in severity. There were imbalances noted in Level 3 AEs and SAEs such that there were higher 
frequencies of these AEs in the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab treatment group than in the other 2 
groups ((Level 3 AEs: 15.7% mixed motavizumab/palivizumab, 6.0% mixed 
palivizumab/motavizumab, 6.5% control motavizumab; SAEs: 22.9% mixed 
motavizumab/palivizumab, 8.4% mixed palivizumab/motavizumab, 11.8% control motavizumab). 
These increases were consistently observed both prior to dose 3 (ie, before the second of the 2 study 
drugs was administered) and post dose 3 in the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab treatment group 
suggesting a cause other than receipt of both study drugs. The increased frequency of SAEs in the 
mixed motavizumab/palivizumab treatment group in either time period was attributable to SAEs in the 
System Organ Class of Infections and Infestations with few RSV infections reported. A total of 3 related 
SAEs were reported in 2 children in the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab group after the receipt of 
motavizumab only (visual disturbance and erythema multiforme) and 1 child in the control 
motavizumab group (abnormal liver function test). Two deaths occurred on study, one subsequent to a 
SAE of sepsis and the second subsequent to a SAE of pneumonia. While both deaths occurred in the 
mixed motavizumab/palivizumab treatment group, both occurred after receipt of motavizumab only, 
and neither death was felt to be related to study drug. 
Immunogenicity: Overall, immunogenicity in all treatment groups was low (anti-motavizumab 
antibody: 5.1% mixed motavizumab/palivizumab, 2.4% mixed  palivizumab/motavizumab, 0.0% 
EMA/780068/2013

control motavizumab; anti-palivizumab antibody: 5.1%, 2.4%, and 1.1%, respectively). A total of 13 
patients (8 patients, mixed motavizumab/palivizumab; 4 patients, mixed palivizumab/motavizumab; 1 
patient control motavizumab) had anti-palivizumab and/or antimotavizumab antibody at protocol-
specified time points. In the majority of these patients with detectable antibody, antibody was  
detected at Study Day 150 and/or 120-150 days post final dose. Anti-motavizumab titers ranged from 
1:10 to 1:1250. Anti-palivizumab titers ranged from 1:10 to 1:20. One patient who was in the mixed 
motavizumab/palivizumab group had an SAE of erythema multiforme 2 days after the second dose of 
motavizumab (Study Day 28) that was judged to be probably related to study drug; anti-motavizumab 
antibody with a titer of 1:50 was detected subsequently at Study Day 150. 
No anti-motavizumab antibody was detected at any protocol-specified time point in any patient in the 
control motavizumab treatment group. 
Pharmacokinetics: In the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab, mixed palivizumab/motavizumab, and 
control motavizumab groups, as expected, mean serum trough levels of motavizumab were highest on 
Study Day 60 (74.74 μg/mL), Study Day 150 (93.05 μg/mL), and Study Day 150 (105.8 μg/mL), 
respectively. Mean serum trough levels of palivizumab were highest at Study Day 150 (107.4 μg/mL) 
in the mixed motavizumab/palivizumab treatment group and at Study Day 60 (87.37 μg/mL) in the 
mixed palivizumab/motavizumab treatment group. A low level of serum palivizumab or  motavizumab 
was detected among samples from patients who had not received palivizumab or motavizumab, most 
probably due to a low level of cross-reactivity between the assays for serum palivizumab and 
motavizumab. 
CHMP’s comments:  
Agrees with the MAH who concludes that in this study with a limited number of subjects, dosing of 
motavizumab and palivizumab during the same RSV season in high-risk children was safe and well-
tolerated. The total number of subjects with AEs was similar among the 3 treatment groups. There was 
a higher number of SAEs in the motavizumab/palivizumab group; however, this was due to the 
occurrence of more SAEs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations and was not judged to be due to 
either study drug alone or that particular sequence of administration. Immunogenicity was low, and 
mean serum trough concentrations of motavizumab and palivizumab were within the ranges expected. 
These findings suggest that both motavizumab and palivizumab can be safely administered in high-risk 
children during a single RSV season. As indicated previously, the development of motavizumab has 
been discontinued.  
MI-CP116. A Phase IV, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Assess the Immune Reactivity of 
the Liquid and Lyophilized Formulations of Palivizumab (MEDI-493, Synagis) in Children at 
High Risk for the Development of Serious RSV Disease 
Description 
Methods 
•  Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of the liquid formulation of 
palivizumab compared to the lyophilized formulation. 
•  Study design 
This was a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind study to provide additional data to compare 
immunogenicity [reported as anti-drug antibody (ADA)] of the liquid and lyophilized formulations of 
palivizumab in children at high risk for serious RSV disease. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 17/29 
 
 
 
either 15 mg/kg palivizumab liquid or lyophilized formulation by intramuscular (IM) injection every 30 
days for a total of 5 injections during the RSV season. Subjects were monitored through Study Day 
150 for serious adverse events (SAEs). Serum palivizumab concentrations and anti-palivizumab 
antibody were measured at baseline prior to dosing, and again at one time point between Study Days 
240 and 300 (4 to 6 months after the final dose of study drug). 
•  Study population /Sample size 
The subjects were medically stable children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity who were 
≤24 months of age at randomization, or children born prematurely [≤35 weeks gestational age (GA)] 
who were ≤6 months of age at randomization. 
Approximately 400 subjects were planned for enrollment. 
• 
Treatments 
Test product: Palivizumab (Synagis), liquid formulation, provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of 
palivizumab in 1 ml of sterile preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM 
histidine and 1.6 mM glycine.  
Reference product: Lyophilized palivizumab provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of sterile 
lyophilized product that when formulated (before lyophilization) contains 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM 
glycine, and 3% (w/v) mannitol at pH 6.0. Reconstitution with 1 ml of Sterile Water for Injection yields 
palivizumab at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. 
Dose and duration of both formulations: 15 mg/kg IM every 30 days for a total of 5 injections during 
the RSV season. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics: Serum for measurement of anti-palivizumab antibodies and 
palivizumab concentrations from both formulations was collected at baseline prior to first dose, and 
again at one time point between Study Days 240 and 300 (actual, 112 to 203 days after the final dose 
of study  drug). 
Safety: Serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected from the period immediately following the first 
administration of study drug through Study Day 150. 
•  Statistical Methods 
All tabular summaries were presented by treatment group. Categorical data were summarized by the 
number and percent of subjects in each category. Continuous variables are summarized by descriptive 
statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. No statistical tests were 
planned or conducted. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
417 were randomized into the study at 51 sites in the United States between 20 October 2005 and 28 
December 2006. A total of 4 subjects randomized at one site (2 liquid palivizumab, 2 lyophilized 
palivizumab) received all 5 doses of study drug, per drug accountability records. However, despite 
attempts by the MAH to contact the site, no further information including the case report forms on 
these subjects could be obtained. These 4 subjects are therefore excluded from all data analyses. The 
remaining 413 subjects were randomized (211 liquid palivizumab; 202 lyophilized palivizumab) and 
followed. All 413 subjects received at least one dose of study drug and are included in all summaries of 
safety. There were 7 subjects excluded from the immunogenicity analyses: 6 subjects for having 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 18/29 
 
 
 
received only one dose of study drug, and one subject for not having a blood sample collected at 
baseline or Study Day 240-300. 
•  Baseline data 
Each subject participated during a single RSV season. Compliance with dosing and follow-up was good 
with 95.0% of lyophilized palivizumab subjects and 94.8% of liquid palivizumab subjects receiving all 5 
doses of study drug, and 94.1% and 93.4% completing the study, respectively.

Anti-palivizumab antibodies were detected in one (0.5%) subject in the lyophilized palivizumab group 
(at 154 days post final dosing) and no subjects in the liquid palivizumab group, with an overall rate of 
0.3% for both treatment groups combined. Given these observations and the number of subjects 
studied, the true immunogenicity rate (based on the upper limit of the exact 95% CI) is at most 2.9% 
for the lyophilized palivizumab group, 1.9%for the liquid palivizumab group, and 1.5% for both 
treatment groups combined. 
•  Safety results 
A total of 30 (7.3%) out of 413 subjects reported SAEs during the conduct of the study. 
There was a slight increase in subjects who experienced an SAE in the liquid palivizumab group 
compared to the lyophilized palivizumab group (5.9% lyophilized palivizumab; 8.5% liquid 
palivizumab) but these events were generally consistent with the underlying conditions in this pediatric 
age group. None of these SAEs were judged to be related to study drug. No subjects were discontinued 
from study drug dosing for any AE or SAE. One subject in the lyophilized palivizumab group died from 
reported asphyxia due to accidental suffocation after receiving four doses of study drug, and the death 
was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. 
CHMP’s comment:  
The immunogenicity of the liquid and lyophilized formulations of palivizumab 240-300 days post final 
dose was examined in this study. The frequency of detection of anti-palivizumab antibodies was low. 
The true immunogenicity rate for both treatment groups combined (as calculated by the upper limit of 
the 95% CI) was less than 1.5% and was not higher than 2.9% and 1.9% for lyophilized and liquid 
palivizumab groups, respectively.

1. To compare the incidence of medically-attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) between 
treatment groups 
2. To compare the incidence of RSV-specific medically-attended LRI in a subset of patients 
3. To compare the frequency and incidence of medically-attended otitis media (OM) infections between 
treatment groups 
4. To compare the frequency of prescribed antibiotics for medically-attended LRI and medically-
attended OM infections 
5. To describe the trough serum concentrations of motavizumab 
6. To describe the immunogenicity of motavizumab 
•  Study design 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-center, multinational trial. 
Children were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive motavizumab or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM 
injection every 30 days for a total of 5 injections. Randomization was blocked by study site and 
stratified according to the presence/absence of chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity requiring 
medical intervention/management. All patients were evaluated just prior to each injection of study 
drug with a final post dosing follow-up at Study Day 150. The trial was conducted during 2 consecutive 
northern hemisphere seasons with an intervening RSV season in the southern hemisphere. Each child 
only participated during a single RSV season. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
The patients were: 1) children ≤24 months of age with a diagnosis of CLD of prematurity requiring 
medical intervention/management (i.e., supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, or diuretics) within the 
6 months before randomization, or 2) children born at ≤35 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth and ≤6 
months of age at randomization. 
Approximately 6600 patients were planned for enrollment. 
• 
Treatments 
Test product: Motavizumab 15 mg/kg IM - provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of motavizumab 
in 1 mL of a sterile preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM 
histidinehydrochloride. 
Reference product: Palivizumab 15 mg/kg IM - provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of 
palivizumab in 1 mL of a sterile preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM 
histidine, and 1.6 mM glycine.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: Patients were evaluated just prior to each injection of study drug, with a final post dosing 
follow-up evaluation at Study Day 150. Patients were monitored throughout the trial for all 
hospitalizations, medically-attended LRIs, and medically-attended OM. Patients hospitalized for 
respiratory illness, or who developed a respiratory illness during hospitalization, were to be assessed 
for RSV by diagnostic testing of respiratory secretions. RSV testing was performed centrally using a 
validated, real-time RT-PCR RSV diagnostic test. For a subset of patients, RSV diagnostic testing of 
nasal secretions was performed in the event of medically-attended outpatient lower respiratory illness. 
All sites participating in this trial were solicited to be among the subset RSV-specific LRI population. 
Those centers which agreed to participate were required to involve the entire population randomized at 
the site.

Safety: Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications were 
collected from the period immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study 
Day 150. Blood was also collected prior to the first and last dose of study drug for safety evaluations. 
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: Serum for measurement of anti-motavizumab antibodies and 
motavizumab concentrations was collected prior to the first and last dose of study drug. Additionally, 
all patients were randomly assigned to have blood collected prior to the second, third, or fourth 
injection of study drug for these evaluations. 
•  Statistical Methods 
All tabular summaries were presented by treatment group. In general, categorical data were 
summarized by the number of patients falling within each category. Continuous variables were 
summarized by descriptive statistics including mean, standard error or deviation, median minimum, 
and maximum. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of RSV hospitalization from randomization through 
Study Day 150. The analysis was based on protocol-specified central RSV test   results from the 
respiratory secretions analyzed via real-time RT-PCR. Respiratory hospitalizations with a positive result 
for this RSV test were counted in the primary analysis of RSV hospitalization. In addition, a new onset 
of lower respiratory symptoms in an already hospitalized child, with an objective measure of worsening 
respiratory status and a positive RSV test result, was counted as a primary endpoint. Deaths that could 
be demonstrated as caused by RSV (by autopsy or clinical history and virologic evidence) were also 
considered primary endpoints. The primary endpoint was evaluated by constructing a 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) around the observed relative risk (RR) of motavizumab compared to 
palivizumab. Motavizumab was to be declared non-inferior to palivizumab if the upper bound of the CI 
for RR was <1.265. If non-inferiority was declared then an assessment of superiority was to be made. 
Motavizumab was to be declared superior to palivizumab if the upper bound of the CI for RR was <1. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included the incidence of medically-attended LRI (including RSV-
specific LRI), the frequency and incidence of medically-attended OM infections, and frequency of 
antibiotic use for LRI and OM. In general, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach stratified by presence 
or absence of CLD of prematurity requiring medical intervention/management was used. When the 
data were ordered, a row-mean score statistic was used. The categories that were used to evaluate the 
number of OM episodes were: no episodes, 1 episode, 2 episodes, and ≥3 episodes. 
Comparisons between treatment groups were made for the total number of patients reporting at least 
one AE and at the system organ class level for all AEs, related AEs, SAEs, and fatalities using Fisher’s 
exact test. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 6635 were randomized (3306 palivizumab; 3329 motavizumab) at 347 centers in 24 
countries within the northern and southern hemispheres between 01/Nov/2004 and 09/Dec/2005. 
•  Baseline data 
Each child participated in the study for a single RSV season, and approximately 98% completed the 
trial. A total of 97% of children in each treatment group received all 5 doses of study drug.

Motavizumab achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to palivizumab in the reduction 
of RSV hospitalizations in this population of high-risk children. The overall RSV hospitalization rates in 
both groups were low, <2%. There were 26% fewer RSV hospitalizations in the motavizumab group 
compared to the palivizumab group [RR: 0.740, 95% CI: (0.503, 1.083)]. This finding was robust, with 
a non-inferiority p-value <0.01, based on the 99% CI. Motavizumab recipients had 50% fewer RSV-
specific lower respiratory infections requiring outpatient medical treatment, in the pre-specified subset 
of sites participating in the nasal secretion sample collection for this endpoint, demonstrating statistical 
superiority of motavizumab over palivizumab (p=0.005). For each of the RSV-specific efficacy 
outcomes, consistency with the primary analysis was observed across subgroups. 
•  Safety results 
Motavizumab and palivizumab demonstrated similar rates of AEs and SAEs, related AEs and SAEs, and 
study drug discontinuations. The majority (96%) of AEs were Level 1 or 2 in severity regardless of 
study drug treatment, and the incidence of Level 3 and 4 AEs was balanced between treatment groups. 
The most commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (30.1% palivizumab vs. 29.1% 
motavizumab), pyrexia (16.9% vs. 16.4%), rhinitis (13.5% vs. 13.3%), and otitis media (12.8% vs. 
13.1%) 
AEs in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder system organ class were increased in the 
motavizumab group compared to the palivizumab group (20.7% and 18.5%, respectively). 
Possible contributors to this difference were identified as AEs of rash (3.1%, palivizumab; 4.0%, 
motavizumab) and urticaria (0.3% palivizumab; 0.7%, motavizumab). Most of these events were mild, 
transient, and did not result in discontinuation of study drug. Skin events with preferred terms 
consistent with hypersensitivity that occurred within 2 days of a dose (8, 0.2% palivizumab vs. 22, 
0.7% motavizumab), Level 3 or SAE events (0.0% vs. 9, 0.3%), and those that resulted in 
discontinuation of study drug (0.0% vs. 9, 0.3%) were infrequent but had a higher incidence in 
motavizumab recipients compared to children receiving palivizumab. Eight (0.2%) patients in the 
motavizumab group with specific skin events consistent with hypersensitivity were redosed without 
recurrences. There was no evidence of a difference between the two treatment groups with regard to 
respiratory events of interest that may be associated with hypersensitivity. 
The overall mortality rates (4, 0.1% palivizumab; 8, 0.2% motavizumab) were not statistically 
significantly different between the treatment groups and lower than in a previous placebo-controlled 
study of palivizumab (MI-CP018). No death was considered to be related to study drug by the site 
investigators, and none were RSV-related. The rate of SIDS/sudden unexplained death in each 
treatment group was similar to or lower than the expected rate for high-risk infants. 
• 
Immunogenicity: 
A total of 22 (0.7%) children had anti-motavizumab binding activity (defined as a titer with a dilution 
of ≥1:10) at any time after the start of dosing, with titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:31250. An additional 
7 patients had anti-motavizumab antibody detected pre-dose 1 but antibody was not detected at any 
time point post baseline in these patients. The incidence of immunogenicity in the motavizumab group 
was low, less than 1%, and comparable to the historical palivizumab rate (0.7% in the palivizumab 
group in MI-CP018 30 days following the fourth injection). There were no clinical safety effects that 
could be associated with detectable antibody. 
• 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Mean trough serum concentrations of motavizumab at 30 days post dose 1 were 45.95 μg/mL. Mean 
trough serum concentrations were 64.59, 80.24, and 88.52 μg/mL at 30 days post dose 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively. A small number of motavizumab patients (n=22, 0.7%) had detectable immunogenicity 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 22/29 
 
 
 
at any time post baseline during the study. Mean trough serum concentrations of motavizumab for 
these children appeared lower after 2 doses of study drug, compared to children without detectable 
antibody. However, there were only a small number of observations at any one time point and there 
was marked variability in drug concentrations such that individual values for patients with detectable 
antibodies were within the range of those seen for patients without detectable antibody. 
CHMP’s comments:  
In this phase III study including more than 6600 high risk children with prematurity and CLD of  
prematurity motavizumab demonstrated improved activity compared to palivizumab in the reduction of 
serious RSV disease. Furthermore, palivizumab and motavizumab were well-tolerated with comparable 
overall rates of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. Immunogenicity to palivizumab and 
motavizumab was low. As indicated previously, the development of motavizumab has been 
discontinued. 
MI-CP124. A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Immunogenicity of MEDI-524, a Humanized Enhanced Potency Monoclonal Antibody Against 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), in Children with Hemodynamically Significant Congenital 
Heart Disease 
Description 
Methods 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective was to describe the safety and tolerability of motavizumab when given monthly 
as prophylaxis against serious RSV infection among children with hemodynamically significant 
congenital heart disease (CHD). 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
1. To describe the incidence of RSV hospitalization in children with hemodynamically significant CHD 
given motavizumab or palivizumab for prophylaxis against serious RSV disease 
2. To describe the incidence of RSV outpatient medically-attended lower respiratory infection (MA-LRI) 
in each treatment group (for subjects randomized in Season 2 only) 
3. To describe the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of motavizumab 
4. To describe the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on serum motavizumab concentrations 
•  Study design 
A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multicenter, multinational study 
conducted over two RSV seasons (2005-2006 and 2007-2008) in the northern hemisphere. Each 
subject participated only during a single RSV season. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either 15 mg/kg motavizumab or 15 mg/kg  palivizumab. Randomization was blocked by site 
and stratified by presence or absence of cyanotic CHD. Study drug was administered by intramuscular 
(IM) injection every 30 days during the RSV season for a total of 5 scheduled doses. Additionally, 
children who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass through Study Day 150 were to 
receive a protocol-specified replacement dose of study drug immediately following the surgery when 
determined by the physician to be medically stable for an IM injection. Any subsequent doses of study 
drug were continued to be given according to the protocol-specified dosing schedule. All subjects were 
evaluated just prior to each injection of study drug with a final post dosing follow-up at Study Day 150.

•  Study population /Sample size 
The subjects in this study had to be ≤ 24 months of age at randomization with documented 
hemodynamically significant CHD that was unoperated or partially corrected. Approximately 1400 
subjects were planned for enrollment.  
• 
Treatments 
Test product: Motavizumab 15 mg/kg IM - provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of motavizumab 
in 1 mL of a sterile preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM 
histidinehydrochloride. 
Reference product: Palivizumab 15 mg/kg IM - provided in sterile vials containing 100 mg of 
palivizumab in 1 mL of a sterile preservative-free liquid product at pH 6.0, formulated with 25 mM 
histidine, and 1.6 mM glycine.  
The products were administered every 30 days for a total of 5 doses. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety: Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications were 
collected from the period immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study 
Day 150. Blood was collected prior to the first and last doses of study drug for serum chemistries (AST, 
ALT, BUN, and creatinine) as part of the safety evaluation; vital signs were measured prior to and 30 
minutes after each dose of study drug. Subjects were evaluated just prior to each dose of study drug, 
with a final post-dosing follow-up evaluation at Study Day 150. 
Efficacy: Subjects were monitored throughout the study for all hospitalizations during Seasons 1 and 2 
and for outpatient medically-attended lower respiratory (MA-LR) illnesses during Season 2. Subjects 
hospitalized for a cardiac/respiratory illness (other than planned surgical procedures not associated 
with an acute illness), or whenever a cardiac/respiratory deterioration occurred during an admission, 
were assessed for RSV by diagnostic testing of respiratory secretions. Subjects with an outpatient MA-
LR illness had nasal secretions collected that were tested for RSV. RSV testing was performed centrally 
using a validated real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) RSV diagnostic 
test for RSV A and RSV B. 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA): Serum was collected from all subjects pre-
Dose 1 and 30 days post-Doses 1 and 4 (Study Days 0, 30, and 120) for  measuring trough serum 
concentrations of motavizumab and ADA to palivizumab and motavizumab. Additionally, all subjects 
were randomly assigned to have an additional blood sample collected 30 days post-Doses 2 or 3 
(Study Days 60 or 90) for these evaluations. Trough serum concentrations of motavizumab were 
determined centrally by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-drug antibody 
to motavizumab was determined centrally by an ELISA-based method, which was the original validated 
assay used for the detection of ADA. During the course of the study, a drug-tolerant 
electrochemiluminescent assay (ECLA) was developed. Samples were tested for ADA to motavizumab 
by both assay methods. Anti-motavizumab antibodies were tested for samples obtained at any time 
during the study using the ELISA-based method and for each motavizumab subject’s last available 
post-baseline sample using the ECLA-based method. A motavizumab subject was counted as having 
ADA if detected by ECLA or by ELISA if ECLA testing was not performed due to lack of sample. ADA to 
palivizumab was tested for each subject’s last available post-baseline sample using the ECLA-based 
method only. Subjects who had ADA to palivizumab or motavizumab detected by ECLA or by ELISA if 
ECLA testing was not performed were tested for drug-specific IgE ADA using ECLA. 
•  Statistical Methods

Safety and tolerability were assessed primarily by summarizing AEs and SAEs that occurred through 
Study Day 150 (ie, 30 days post-Dose 5); AEs and SAEs that began after Study Day 150 were not 
collected or summarized. Adverse events and SAEs were summarized by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; Version 11.1), and by 
severity and relationship to study drug. Subjects were counted only once for each preferred term, once 
for each SOC, and by the highest event severity, regardless of how many events the subject 
experienced. Additionally, AEs and SAEs were summarized by CHD stratum and primary cardiac lesion. 
Comparisons between treatment groups were made for the total number of subjects reporting at least 
1 AE and at the SOC level using a two-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) and the p-value for the 
rate difference. Statistical comparisons between treatment groups did not account for multiple 
comparisons and no statistical comparisons were performed within each stratification factor. 
The incidence of RSV hospitalization from Study Day 0 through Study Day 150 was summarized for 
each treatment group. Subjects with multiple RSV hospitalizations were counted once even if 
hospitalized more than once for RSV. RSV hospitalization endpoints included both primary 
(cardiac/respiratory hospitalizations with a positive real-time RT-PCR 
RSV diagnostic test) and nosocomial RSV hospitalizations (new onset of lower respiratory tract 
symptoms with an objective measure of study-defined worsening respiratory status in an already 
hospitalized subject with a positive real-time RT-PCR RSV diagnostic test), as well as deaths that could 
be demonstrated as caused by RSV (based on virologic evidence and either clinical history or autopsy). 
Only subjects randomized in Season 2 were monitored for the incidence of RSV outpatient MA-LRI from 
Study Days 0 through 150 and this was summarized for each treatment group. Subjects were counted 
once, regardless of how many RSV outpatient MA-LRI events occurred. Rates of primary RSV 
hospitalization and RSV outpatient MA-LRIs were evaluated to compare motavizumab to palivizumab 
by constructing a two-sided 95% CI around the observed relative risk. Additionally, the analysis 
included a two-level categorical covariate to control for CHD stratum. 
Other secondary objectives of this study included describing the PK of motaivuzmab, ADA to 
palivizumab and motavizumab, and the effect of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery 
on serum motavizumab concentrations. Mean trough serum concentrations of motavizumab were 
summarized overall, by CHD stratum, and by subjects with and without detectable ADA for the 
motavizumab group using means, standard deviations,  medians, and ranges at each study collection 
time point. Serum samples collected after subjects underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary 
bypass but before receiving a replacement dose were not included in the analysis of trough 
motavizumab concentrations. The number and percentages of subjects with ADA to motavizumab 
detected (titer ≥ lower limit of quantitation), not detected, or not tested were summarized for both the 
ELISA- and ECLA based methods, while the number and percentages of subjects with ADA to 
palivizumab were summarized for the ECLA-based method only. Additionally, summaries were provided 
for drug-specific IgE ADA, which was tested in palivizumab and motavizumab subjects who exhibited 
ADA. 
Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 1236 subjects (612 palivizumab, 624 motavizumab) were randomized at 162 sites (61 North 
America, 73 European Union, and 28 ROW) in 16 countries within the northern hemisphere between 
21Oct2005 and 14Dec2005 in Season 1 and 02Oct2007 and 31Dec2007 in Season 2. One subject was 
withdrawn from the study as per the local Ethics Committee, which deemed that this subject’s data 
could not be used for analysis purposes; data for this subject were not included in this study report. 
EMA/780068/2013 
EMA/CHMP/780068/2013  
Page 25/29 
 
 
 
•  Baseline data 
Each subject participated in the study for a single RSV season, and approximately 97% of subjects in 
each treatment group completed the study. Approximately 95% of subjects in each treatment group 
received all 5 scheduled doses of study drug. 
•  Efficacy results 
Data were collected for the efficacy endpoints of RSV hospitalization (Seasons 1 and 2) and RSV 
outpatient MA-LRI (Season 2); however, the study was not powered to detect statistically significant 
between-group differences in the efficacy endpoints. The overall rates of RSV hospitalization were low 
in both treatment groups and noted to be lower in motavizumab recipients than in palivizumab 
recipients (16 [2.6%] palivizumab, 12 [1.9%] motavizumab). A 25% (RR: 0.746; 95% CI: 0.344, 
1.586) relative reduction in RSV hospitalization was observed in children who received prophylaxis with 
motavizumab versus palivizumab. During Season 2 when subjects were monitored for medically-
attended outpatient lower respiratory illnesses, again, the overall rates were low in both treatment 
groups and the incidence of RSV outpatient MA-LRI was noted to be lower in motavizumab recipients 
than in palivizumab recipients (6 [1.9%] palivizumab, 3 [1.0%] motavizumab). A 50% (RR: 0.495; 
95% CI: 0.101, 1.989) relative reduction in RSV-specific lower respiratory tract infections requiring 
outpatient medical attention was observed in motavizumab recipients compared with palivizumab 
recipients. 
Pharmacokinetics: Trough serum concentrations of motavizumab, excluding serum concentrations after 
cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, increased with each successive monthly dose of study 
drug from a mean ± SD of 46.90 ± 15.20 μg/mL at 30 days post-Dose 1 to 60.94 ± 25.41, 66.59 ± 
34.51, and 77.87 ± 32.75 μg/mL at 30 days post-Doses 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 
These trough levels were similar to those that included serum concentrations after cardiac surgery with 
cardiopulmonary bypass and a replacement dose (46.62 ± 15.46, 60.19 ±  25.50, 65.71 ± 34.17 and 
79.09 ± 34.05, μg/mL, at 30 days post-Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), indicating that the 
replacement dose after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass was adequate for maintaining 
motavizumab concentrations in the same range as for children who did not undergo cardiac surgery 
with cardiopulmonary bypass. Trough serum concentrations were below detectable levels in 1 to 3 
children at various time points during the study. When analyzed by CHD stratum, mean trough serum 
concentrations of motavizumab were similar between the 2 strata. A small number of motavizumab 
subjects (9 [1.5%]) had detectable ADA at any time post baseline during the study. Mean trough 
serum concentrations of motavizumab for these children were lower at most time points evaluated 
compared to children without detectable ADA. 
•  Safety results 
Motavizumab and palivizumab subjects demonstrated similar rates of AEs and SAEs, related AEs and 
SAEs, and study drug discontinuations; 1 palivizumab subject and no motavizumab subjects had study 
drug discontinued by the site investigator due to an AE. Approximately 93% of subjects in both 
treatment groups had an AE reported, which is as expected for this High-risk study population of 
children with CHD. The majority of subjects had AEs of Level 1 or Level 2 as the highest severity level, 
regardless of study drug treatment, and the incidence of Level 3 and Level 4 AEs was balanced 
between treatment groups. The most commonly reported AEs were those expected to occur in this 
pediatric population and included pyrexia (29.2% palivizumab vs 29.8% motavizumab), upper 
respiratory tract infection (28.1% vs. 27.3%), cough (11.6% vs. 14.9%), rhinitis (12.6% vs 14.7%), 
and otitis media (11.4% vs. 12.5%). Furthermore, mortality rates were comparable between the 
treatment groups (10 [1.6%] palivizumab, 9 [1.5%] motavizumab). No deaths were deemed related to 
study drug and none were reported as RSV-related, attributable to SIDS or  reported as a sudden 
EMA/780068/2013

Page 26/29 
 
 
 
unexplained death by the site investigator. However, 4 deaths in each treatment group were assigned 
the designation of a sudden unexplained death by the MAH Medical Monitor because these deaths 
occurred outside the hospital or  emergency department with no definitive cause or autopsy 
performed. 
Additionally, AEs of interest categories were analyzed and included Possible Hypersensitivity Events 
(MAH-defined Skin and Respiratory Events of Interest and Standardized MedDRA Queries [SMQ]-
defined Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions), Injection Site Reactions, Elevated Hepatic 
Transaminases, Apnea/Breathing Abnormalities, and Neurologic Events. 
The incidence of skin events in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder SOC and by MAH-defined 
skin events of interest classification was approximately 3% higher in the motavizumab group than the 
palivizumab group. All events consistent with immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which would 
typically occur within 2 days of a study drug dose, were identified by the analyses for MAH-defined 
Skin and Respiratory Events of Interest. No new events within 2 days of study drug dosing were 
captured by the Angioedema or Anaphylaxis SMQs. Respiratory events were reviewed and were not 
consistent with hypersensitivity reactions. Skin events within 2 days of a study drug dose occurred in 7 
(1.1%) palivizumab and 14 (2.3%) motavizumab subjects. Most (80%) of these events were Level 1 
or Level 2 in severity; Level 3 events or SAEs occurred in 2 (0.3%) palivizumab and 8 (1.3%) 
motavizumab subjects, while no events were Level 4 in severity. Of these 21 subjects with skin events 
within 2 days of a study drug dose, 8 (3 palivizumab, 5 motavizumab) experienced the event after the 
last study drug dose with no subsequent doses given, while 13 subjects (4 palivizumab, 9 
motavizumab) were redosed with 1 motavizumab subject experiencing a recurrence of the event; this 
event of erythema recurred within 2 days of the last study drug dose, was Level 1 in severity, and 
resolved within 1 day of onset without treatment. No events consistent with anaphylaxis were 
identified in either treatment group. Additionally, multiple analyses were conducted to identify possible 
hypersensitivity events with a late onset (>2 days after dosing) that would be consistent with a severe 
cutaneous reaction. In the majority of subjects with skin events of interest, the event occurred beyond 
2 days of dosing (36/44 [81.8%] palivizumab, 45/63 [71.4%] motavizumab); most of these events 
were Level 1 or Level 2 in severity, transient, and did not recur with subsequent doses. Two subjects in 
the motavizumab group had events reported as erythema multiforme. From the details available for 
these events, it appeared that both cases would be considered erythema multiforme minor; 1 subject 
was redosed without recurrence, while the other subject was not redosed. There was no evidence in 
either treatment group of events that would be consistent with more severe reactions such as 
erythema multiforme major, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
In each of the remaining AEs of interest categories (Injection Site Reactions, Elevated Liver 
Transaminases, Apnea/Breathing Abnormalities, and Neurologic Events), the overall incidence of 
events was numerically lower in the motavizumab group compared with the palivizumab group 
(percentage-point differences ranging from 0.3% to 2.5%). In regards to cardiac procedures, there 
were numerically more planned and urgent procedures performed in more palivizumab than 
motavizumab subjects. 
Anti-Drug Antibodies: In this study, there was a similar rate of detectable ADA to palivizumab and 
motavizumab for subjects receiving the corresponding monoclonal antibody (9 [1.5%] palivizumab by 
ECLA, 9 [1.5%] motavizumab by ELISA/ECLA). No IgE was detected in any subject who exhibited ADA 
in either treatment group. All palivizumab and motavizumab subjects who exhibited ADA had ≥ 1 AE 
reported. Within each treatment group, the type and frequency of AEs in subjects with detectable ADA 
were similar to those in subjects without detectable ADA, and between treatment groups, the type and 
frequency of AEs in subjects who exhibited ADA were generally balanced as well. In the motavizumab 
group, 3 subjects with detectable ADA had a skin event of interest; all 3 events were transient and 
none recurred with subsequent study drug doses, thus, making an association between the event and

ADA unlikely. No palivizumab subjects with detectable ADA had a skin event of interest. Of the 
subjects who exhibited ADA in either treatment group, 1 subject in the palivizumab group was 
hospitalized for RSV, and none of the subjects in either treatment group had a RSV outpatient MA-LRI. 
CHMP’s comments:  
In this Phase II study motavizumab was compared to palivizumab with regard to safety, 
immunogenicity and efficacy in a randomized, double-blind design. 1236 children less than 2 years of 
age with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were enrolled. The 2 groups had similar 
overall rates of AEs and SAEs, but motavizumab recipients had approximately a 3% higher incidence of 
in Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC events and sponsor-defined skin events of interest. 
Approximately 93% of subjects in both treatment groups had an AE reported, which was as expected 
for this high-risk study population of children with CHD. The most commonly reported AEs were 
pyrexia (29.2% palivizumab versus 29.8% motavizumab), upper respiratory tract infection (28.1% 
versus 27.3%), cough (11.6% versus 14.9%), rhinitis (12.6% versus 14.7%), and otitis media (11.4% 
versus 12.5%). 
Mortality rates were comparable between the treatment groups (10 [1.6%] palivizumab, 9 [1.5%] 
motavizumab). No deaths were judged related to study drug and none were reported as RSV-related. 
The incidence of ADA to palivizumab and motavizumab was low (1.5% in both groups). No IgE was 
detected in any subject who exhibited ADA. 
The study was not powered to detect statistically significant between-group differences in efficacy 
endpoints; however, relative reductions of 25% in RSV hospitalization (16 [2.6%] palivizumab, 12 
[1.9%] motavizumab).and 50% in RSV outpatient MA-LRI were observed in subjects who received 
monthly doses of motavizumab compared with palivizumab. As indicated previously, the development 
of motavizumab has been discontinued. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH for Synagis, palvizumab, has submitted 7 clinical studies in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
Two of the studies are small uncontrolled studies of the safety and efficacy of palivizumab in special 
populations: 28 Japanese children with immunocompromised medical conditions in study M12-420 and 
94 Russian infants at high risk of severe RSV infection in Study W10-664. 
Two of the studies are randomized, double-blind studies comparing palivizumab to motavizumab. In 
the phase II Study MI-CP124 including 1236 children below 2 years of age with hemodynamically 
significant CHD the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; in the phase III Study MI-CP110 
including 6635 children ≤ 24 months of age with CLD of prematurity or ≤ 35 weeks gestational age at 
birth the primary objectives were safety and efficacy. 
In one phase II, randomized, double-blind study including 260 children at high risk for RSV infection 
(Study MI-CP127) the primary objective was to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 
palivizumab and motavizumab when administered to the same subjects within the same season. 
Study MI-CP118, a phase 1/2 randomised, double-blind study, evaluated the immunogenicity, 
pharmacokinetics and safety of palivizumab and motavizumab when administered to 136 children who 
in the previous RSV-season had motavizumab in another clinical trial.

As indicated previously, the development of motavizumab has been discontinued. 
Finally, in the phase IV study MI-CP116 the lyophilized and the liquid formulations of palivizumab were 
compared with regard to immune reactivity in 417 children at high risk for RSV infection. 
The MAH has for each study submitted a Clinical Overview; however a Clinical Overview summarizing 
the 7 studies has not been provided. From the Cover Letter it appears that the MAH is of the opinion 
that Studies M12-420, W10-664, MI-CP118 and MI-CP127 do not influence the benefit-risk balance for 
palivizumab and therefore do not require regulatory action on the marketing authorization. The CHMP 
agrees in this conclusion. No data from children with immunocompromised medical conditions are 
included in the currently approved SmPC for palivizumab; however the results of Study M12-420 are 
not strong enough (open-label study in 28 children) to qualify for implementation in the SmPC.  
The results of Study MI-CP127, demonstrated that palivizumab and motavizumab can be used 
interchangeable; however, as indicated previously, the development of motavizumab was 
discontinued. Hence, this information is irrelevant for the palivizumab SmPC. 
The MAH claims that studies MI-CP116, MI-CP110 and MI-CP124 will be submitted as supportive 
clinical experience in an extension application consisting of the full relevant data package to register 
the solution for injection formulation in the EU in October 2013. Hence, the impact of these studies on 
the SmPC will be assessed with this procedure. Of note, the data on anti-human antibody to 
palivizumab from these 3 studies have been included in the EU SmPC section 4.8 as a result of 
variation II/77. 
Overall conclusion 
Results from the 7 studies submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation are in 
agreement with the currently approved SmPC and no further regulatory action is deemed necessary. 
Recommendation  
No regulatory action required

Summary of risk management plan for Spectrila (recombinant L-asparaginase) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Spectrila. The RMP details important 
risks of Spectrila, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Spectrila’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
Spectrila’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Spectrila should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Spectrila  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Spectrila’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Spectrila  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adults  and  children  with  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains asparaginase produced in Escherichia 
coli  cells  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  administered 
intravenously. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Spectrila’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Spectrila’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spectrila. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of  Spectrila,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Spectrila’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;  
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Spectrila  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Spectrila. Potential risks are concerns for which 
  
 
 
 
 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
Spectrila. 
II.C.2 Other studies in the post-authorisation development plan 
MC-Spectrila.1/ALL 
Purpose of the study:  
The  experience  with  recombinant  L-asparaginase  in  adult  patients  with  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia is limited. Therefore, the applicant committed to conduct a post-authorisation efficacy 
and safety study in this population. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  the  assessment  of  induction  phase  response,  defined  as 
subjects  with  asparaginase  activity  trough  levels  in  serum  ≥  100  U/L  in  induction  phase. 
Secondary  objectives  include  asparaginase  activity  trough  levels  in  serum  in  induction  phase. 
Tertiary  objectives  include  the  assessment  of  consolidation  phase  response,  assessment  of 
asparaginase activity trough levels in serum in consolidation phase II, asparagine levels in serum 
and  cerebrospinal  fluid,  complete  remission  status  and  minimal  residual  disease  status, 
immunogenicity (incl. anti-asparaginase antibodies), and safety.
